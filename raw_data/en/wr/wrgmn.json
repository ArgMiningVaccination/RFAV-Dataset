We used femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FMNS) to distinguish central and peripheral factors of neuromuscular fatigue. We used a progressive incremental loading with multiple assessments to limit the influence of subject's cooperation and motivation. 20 healthy subjects (10 men and 10 women) performed the test on two different days. Maximal voluntary strength and evoked qu adriceps responses via FMNS were measured before, after each set of 10 submaximal isometric contractions (5 -s on/5 -s of maximal voluntary strength with 10% increments), immediately and 30 min after task failure. The test induced progr essive peripheral (41 \u00b1 13% reduction in single twitch at task failure) and central fatigue (3 \u00b1 7 % reduction in voluntary activation at task failure). Good inter-day reliability was found for the total number of submaximal contractions achieved (i.e. endurance index: ICC = 0.83), for reductions in maximal voluntary strength (ICC > 0.81) and evoked muscular responses ( i.e. fatigue index: ICC > 0.85). Significant sex - differences were also detected. This test shows good reliability for strength, endurance an d fatigability assessments. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate its feasibility and reliability in patients. Keywords: Muscle; Neuromuscular function (NMF) can be div ided into three main components, i.e. strength, endurance and fatigability . The NMF of locomotor muscles has been extensively studied in the fields of exercise and clinical physiology. Impairm ent of locomotor muscles function has been identified as a relevant contributing factor of exercise intolerance and disability in various pathologic conditions, such as neuromuscular diseases (Wiles and Karni, 1983 ; Colombo et al., 2000 ; Rozman et al., 2001 ; Grabljevec et al., 2005 ), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Saey et al., 2003 ), and chronic heart failure (Opasich et al., 1999 ). Quadriceps weakness has been correlated with mortality in COPD (Swallow et al., 2007a ) and c hronic heart failure (Hulsmann et al., 2004 ) patients. NMF impairment is also critical in the elderly population regarding the occurrence of falls (Moreland et al., 2004 ) and mortality (Newman et al., 2006 ). Strength, endurance and fatigability can be impacted to a different degree depending on the pathology. For instan ce, COPD patients exhibit larger locomotor muscle endurance impairment than strength impairment (Van't Hul et al., 2004 ; Saey and Troosters, 2008 ). In coronary artery disease, endurance can be reduced despite preserved strength (Gayda et al., 2005 ). Also, strength and endur ance may not change in a similar way during the natural history of the disease as well as following therapeutic interventions (Serres et al., 1998 ). Exercise therapy (Orngreen et al., 2005 ; van der Kooi et al., 2005 ) and other emerging therapies seem to present a wide potential to improve NMF. Therefore, there is a need for both d iagnosis and follow -up purposes to develop reliable NMF assessment tools providing a comprehensive evaluation of strength, endurance and fatigue (Saey and Troosters, 2008 ). Validated procedures to measure volitional quadriceps strength with normative values are well documented (Horemans et al., 2004 ; Hogrel et al., 2007 ; Seymour et al., 2010 ). NMF embraces peripheral and central contribution (Gandevia, 2001 ) that cannot be explored by the traditional measurement of maximal voluntary strength. Artificially -evoked muscular responses via femoral nerve electrical (Prasartwuth et al., 2005 ; Millet et al., 2011 ) or more recently, magnetic (Polkey et al., 1996a ; O'Brien et al., 2008 ) stimulation have been used as a tool to assess non -volitional peripheral strength and the degree of mus cle activation. Similarly, neuromuscular fatigue ( i.e. exercise -induced reduction in voluntary II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 86 (Bigland -Ritchie 1978 )) involves peripheral ( i.e. exercise -induced reduction in muscle contractility) and central mechanisms ( i.e. exercise -induced reduction in muscle activation during voluntary contractions caused by a decreased in motoneurons output at the spinal or/and supr aspinal level (Gandevia, 2001 )) that can be explored with artificial stimulation. Femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) has been shown to be better tolerated than traditional electrical neurostimulation (Han et al., 2006 ; Szecsi et al., 2010 ) and to provide comparable results (Verges et al., 2009 ). Muscle endurance is commonly assessed by the ability to maintain or to repeat a submaximal contraction based on a fraction of the maximal voluntary strength. However, there is no standardized m ethod and various protocols involving different contraction patterns such as isometric or dynamic contractions on isokinetic or custom chairs, sustained or intermittent submaximal contractions ( e.g. (Serres et al., 1998 ; Couillard et al., 2003 ; Koechlin et al., 2004 )) have been used. The subjects' motiva tion and their capacity to withstand pain is a key factor in these 'task failure' designs (Enoka and Stuart, 1992 ). This can, at least partly, explain why patients exhibit a wider variability in endurance time than healthy subjects. For instance, Gruet et al. (2010 ) found that cystic fibrosis patients had a b etween -day variability in quadriceps endurance more than twice greater than healthy subjects, even when well encouraged. Typically, muscle fatigue is characterized from pre - to post maximal exercise measurements only, so that fatigue kinetic is not reporte d and the amount of fatigue is dependent on the cooperation of the patient to reach maximal achievement. An alternative could be an incremental exercise protocol starting at a low fraction of maximal isometric strength with repetitive NMF assessment to des cribe fatigue kinetic. Such a test would be more progressive than constant -load protocols usually performed at 50 -70% of maximal voluntary strength and achievable by patients, even in advanced stage of disease. Another critical advantage of such a design i s to limit motivation and pain confounding factors because it allows comparing a fatigue level after a standardized amount of muscular work rather than a final maximal performance as the only reference. Hence, we propose a quadriceps intermittent fatigue t est (QIF test) aiming to i) measure strength, endurance and fatigability in a single session, ii) distinguish peripheral and central fatigue factors using FMNS, iii) bypass the influence of psychological/motivational confounding factors on fatigability ass essment. The aim of the present study was to PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 87 evaluate the feasibility and the reproducibility of the QIF test as well as its ability to detect inter-individual differences such as sex differences. METHODS Subjects Twenty healthy subjects (ten males and te n females) volunteered to participate in this study. Their main characteristics are presented in Table 1. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and after approval from the local Committee on Human Research ( Comit\u00e9 de protection d es personnes Sud -EST V ). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Subjects had never been exposed to exercise testing, NMF measurement and nerve stimulation procedures. Protocol Subjects performed three exercise test sessions. During a prel iminary visit, subjects had clinical examination, anthropometric measurements and performed a maximal incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer. During the next two sessions, subjects performed a quadriceps intermittent fatigue test (QIF1 and QIF2). D elay between consecutive QIF test sessions was 9 days on average (range: 5 -19 days). Anthropometric measurements Body fat percentage was assessed by skinfold technique as described by Durnin and Womersley (1974 ). Maximal cycling test Subjects performed a standard maximal incremental exercise test (60 -80 W initial power and 15 W.min -1 increment until subject exhaustion) on a computer -controlled electrically - braked cycle ergometer (Ergometrics 800, Ergoline, Bitz, Germany) with expired gas analysis and 12 -lead electrocardio gram for the determination of maximal aerobic PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 88 oxygen and maximal heart rate (Medisoft, Dinant, Belgium). A fingertip blood sample was obtained 3 min after exhaustion and was analyzed for lactate concentration (NOVA +, Nova Biomedic al Corporation, Waltham MA, USA). Quadriceps intermittent fatigue test (QIF test) Experimental setup . An overview of the experimental setup is shown on Figure 1. All measurements were conducted on the right lower limb under isometric conditions. Subject lay supine on a customized quadriceps chair. The knee was flexed at 90\u00b0 and the hip angle was 130\u00b0 for proper access to the femoral triangle during FNMS. Voluntary strength and evoked responses to FNMS were measured with an inextensible ankle strap connecte d to a strain gauge (SBB 200kg Tempo Technologies, Taipei, Taiwan). Compensatory movement of the upper body was limited by two belts across thorax and abdomen. Subjects were asked to keep their hands on their abdomen. Visual feedback of the force produced and the target force level (see below) was provided to the subjects. Femoral Nerve Magnetic Stimulation (FNMS) . FNMS was performed with a 45 -mm figure -of-eight coil powered by two linked Magstim 200 stimulators (peak magnetic eld 2.5 T, stimulation durati on 0.1 ms; Magstim, Whitland, United Kingdom). The linking circuitry (Bistim Module, Magstim) was capable of precisely controlling the inter -stimulus interval between 1 and 999 ms with an accuracy of 0.05 ms. One stimulator was used for single stimulations (twitch), while both stimulators were used for paired stimulations (doublets with interstimulus interval of 100 ms or 10 ms, i.e. 10 Hz and 100 Hz). All stimuli were given at maximum stimulator output. The coil was positioned high in the femoral triangle in regard to the femoral nerve. Optimal stimulation site allowing maximal unpotentiated quadriceps M -wave amplitude (Mampl) was determined with minor adjustments and marked on the skin. FMNS supramaximality on both sessions was carefully checked after a 20 min rest period by measuring Tw u and M ampl with decreasing stimulator power output (100%, 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%). During both QIF tests, Tw u was not significantly reduced until 85 % of the maximal power output and M ampl was significantly reduced at 80% of maximal power output only, confirming previous results from our laboratory regarding FNMS supramaximality (Verges et al., EMG signal was recorded from the right VL (as a surrogate for whole quadriceps (Place et al., 2007 ) with a pair of 20 -mm diameter s ilver chloride surface electrodes (Meditrace 100, Kendall, Mansfield MA, USA) positioned 25 mm center to center. Low resistance (< 10 k) between the two electrodes was obtained by light abrasion of the skin and cleaning with alcohol. Recording electrode locations were based on SENIAM recommendations (Hermens et al., 2000 ). A reference electrode was placed over the patella. Electromyographic signals were amplied (BioAmp, AD instruments, Medford, USA a bandwidth from 5 Hz to 500 Hz. EMG data together with force signals were digitized online at a sampling frequency of 2,000 Hz and recorded on a dedicated device (PowerL ab, ADInstruments ). QIF test description . Before starting initial NMF assessment, subjects performed ten 5-s submaximal quadriceps contractions in order to warm up the quadriceps muscle and to familiarize themselves with the visual feedback and the so undtrack instructions (see below). Then, subjects performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with 1 min of rest between each MVC. After these initial MVCs, the initial (Pre) neuromuscular assessment was performed (See Fig. 2 for neuromuscular ass essments and test overview). This neuromuscular assessment sequence included a 5 -s MVC superimposed with a doublet at 100 Hz (Db 100,s) and followed after 2 s by two potentiated doublets at 100 Hz (Db 100) and 10 Hz (Db 10) performed 4 s apart. After 15 secon ds of rest, the subject performed a second MVC with a superimposed twitch (Tw s) followed after 2 s by one potentiated twitch (Tw p). During all MVCs, subjects were vigorously encouraged by the experimenter. Potentiated evoked muscular response have been sho wn to be an efficient tool to detect peripheral fatigue (Kufel et al., 2002 ). High ( Db100) and low (Db 100) frequency paired stimulation on a relaxed muscle enable the calculation of low -to-high frequency force ratio (Db 10:100) allowing to distinguish low and high frequency peripheral fatigue. Single stimulation (Tw p) provides an index of excitation -contraction coupling efficiency . High frequency superimposed stimulation (Db 100,s) improve the resolution of central activation a ssessment (Place et al., 2007 ). Paired stimulations have several advantages but they require a complex technical environment (coupling two magnetic stimulators) not always available in clinical or laboratory set tings. Hence, we designed an assessment of the NMF using paired and PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 90 single stimulations to make our test achievable, even with one stimulator ( i.e. performing only single stimulations). After the initial neuromuscular assessment, sets of 10 intermittent co ntractions (5 -s on / 5 -s off) at a submaximal target force were performed, starting at 10% MVC for the first set, 20% MVC for the second set and so on until task failure. Subjects had a visual force feedback providing the target level and listened to a sou ndtrack indicating the contraction - relaxation rhythm. Task failure was defined as two consecutive contractions 10 N below the target force for more than 2.5 s. Five seconds after the end of each set of 10 contractions, at exhaustion (Exh) and after 30 min of recovery (Post 30), neuromuscular assessments similar to the initial measurement were performed. Right before the neuromuscular assessment at Post 30, subjects performed two MVCs 30 s apart in order to fully potentiate the quadriceps response (Kufel et al., 2002 ). The target levels for submaximal contractions during QIF2 were the same as during QIF1. Data Analysis The following parameters were calculated from the mechanical responses to FMNS: peak force for Tw u, Tw p, Tw s ,Db 100 ,Db 100,s and Db 10 as well as the ratio Db 10 over Db 100 (Db 10:100). Peak to peak M -waves amplitude (M ampl) and duration (M duration ) were calculated from potentiated single stimulation. For MVCs, we considered the maximal value of the two maneuvers performed at Pre, after each set, at Exh and at Post 30. Maximal voluntary activation (VA) was calculated as follow fr om the high -frequency doublets and from the /Tw p)] \u00d7 100 A correction was applied to the original equation when the superimposed stimulation was administrated slightly before or after the real peak MVC Komi, 1998 ). PARTIE II: analyzed from the10 -contraction sets at 10% to 50% MVC because they were completed by all subjects. The following parameters were also studied from submaximal contractions of each set: total number of contractions ( i.e. the endurance index), mean strength and the strength -time product calculated over each submaximal contraction. Statistical Analysis All variables are reported as mean (standard deviation (SD)) within text and tables. Normal distribution and homogeneity of variances analysis were confirmed using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov and Skewness test, respectively. Variables during QIF test were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. To compare variable kinetics between QIF1 and QIF2 and to compare male and female, we used a two -way ANOVA with rep eated measures (time \u00d7 day and time \u00d7 sex, respectively). We used t -tests with Bonferroni's correction for post-hoc analysis if ANOVA indicated a significant main effect or interaction. We calculated change in the means values of both sessions with 95% confidence interval and used paired t -test for detection of systematic bias (Atkinson and Nevill, 1998 ). Due to our sample size, we used typical error expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV TE) to study 'absolute' reliability (Hopkins, 2000 ). Relative reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence interval of variation calculated using the online spreadsheet of Hopkins (2002 ). ICCs were not calculated for VAL Db, and VAL Tw due to the ceiling effect associated with these measurements (Clark et al., 2007 ; Place et al., 20 07). For these variables, we used Bland and Altman's method with 95 % limits of agreement (LOA) to assess reliability (Bland and Altman, 1986 ). The alpha level was set at 0.05 for all tests. Statistical analysis was performed with a statisti cal software package (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah USA). PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 92 RESULTS Maximal cycling test Data from the maximal incremental cycling test are presented in Table 1. Subjects were normal weight and their aerobic capacity corresponded to untrained subjects. Blood lact ate concentration 3 min after exhaustion were 9 mmol.L-1 and maximum heart rate was 90% of the theoretical value for all subjects confirming maximality of the incremental cycling test. QIF test results Endurance and muscular work. Mean number of subma ximal contractions (i.e. endurance index) was 59 \u00b1 8 for QIF1 and 59 \u00b1 7 for QIF2. For this variable, CV TE between QIF1 and 0.61 -0.93). Total strength -time product at the end of the 50% set was 15 972 \u00b1 5071 Nm for (95% CI: 0.95 - 0.99). The force ratio between the last submaximal contraction (at Exh.) and the first following MVC was 98(9)% on 98(8)% on QIF2 not to VO 2max (R2 = 0.06, P = 0.29) or peak workload (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.63). MVCs and evoked responses . No differences were found between sessions for MVC and evoked muscular responses to FNMS (Table 2). MVCs and evoked respons es fell progressively along the QIF test (Fig. 3). This decrease became significant compared to Pre from set 20% for MVC max and Db 10:100, and from set 30% for Tw p and Db 100. The reliability of changes in volitional and evoked quadriceps strength is display ed in Table 3 at set 50%, Exh and Post 30. No significant change was found for M -wave amplitude and M-wave duration (P > 0.05, data not shown). MVC and Twp at Pre were not correlated to endurance nor to their % reduction at set 50% (all R2 < 0.3 and P > 0. 05). The total number of sub -maximal contractions appeared to be significantly correlated with the percentage reduction at set 50% of MVC (R2 = 0.48, P < 0.001), Twp (R2 = 0.30, P = 0.01) and Db100 (R2 = 0.53, P = 0.01). Voluntary activation . Figure 4 show s VA changes over the QIF test. A significant reduction was found at set 50%, Exh and Post 30 for VA Db. For VA Tw, this decrease PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 93 reached statistical significance at Exh only. Table 4 and Figure 5 provide between -days reliability of VA at Pre, set 50%, Exh a nd Post 30. Sex-differences . The number of submaximal contractions was greater for women than for men (62 \u00b1 7 vs. 55 \u00b1 5; P = 0.020). As shown in Figure 6, significant differences in fatigue kinetics were found for Db 100 and Tw p indicating a greater level of fatigue for male at set 40%, set 50 % and Exh. MVC followed the same tendency but differences did not reach statistical significance. No significant sex differences were found for VA or M -wave characteristics (P > 0.05, data not shown). DISCUSSION This study aimed at evaluating whether a neuromuscular test that (i) combines quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigability assessment in a single session, (ii) reduces the influence of motivation factors and (iii) assesses central and peripheral factors, w as feasible, reliable and relevant to detect small inter -subject differences as between genders. This test included an incremental intermittent exercise protocol under isometric conditions combined with multiple NMF assessment using FNMS. The main advantag e of this design was to bypass, in part, the motivational and psychological factors related to traditional 'task failure' protocol which constitute a major source of variability, especially in patients (Gruet et al., 2010 ). The present results demonstrate the good reliability of the QIF test which appears to be a promising tool for neuromuscular investigations. Feasibility Muscular work by set was highly -comparable among sessions, indicating that the v isual feedback and instructive soundtrack were well -understood by subjects. The exercise duration did not exceeded 15 min which is acceptable for patients and applicable in clinical practice. In spite of the inexperience of subjects, strength measurement a nd FNMS procedures were well performed and tolerated. Symptoms comparable to moderate delayed onset muscle soreness during days following the test were reported by a few subjects. Regardless, the relatively short (9 days) interval between both tests, MVC a nd evoked PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 94 responses at Pre as well as fatigue kinetics on QIF2 were not altered, indicating the integrity of the contractile and neurologic apparatus (Morton, Atkinson et al. 2005). Induced fatigue The incremental intermittent isometric exercise protocol induced a progressive decline of MVC that can be mainly attributed to peripheral mechanisms as suggested by the large drop in mechanical responses evoked by FNMS (Fig. 3). More specifically, low -frequency fatigue was detected as indicated by reductions in Db10:100 (from 0.91 at Pre to 0.74 at Exh) (Verges et al., 2009 ) and Tw p suggesting an excitation -contraction failure. In addition, M - wave cha racteristics did not change so that impairment of action potential conduction is not involved in the type of fatigue induced by this protocol, at least in healthy subjects. The level of fatigue found at Exh was comparable to previous results at exhaustion following local muscular contractions in similar conditions (Katayama et al., 2007 ). The QIF test leads to some impairment of the maximal ability to activat e the quadriceps as shown by the decrease of VA Db and VA tw (-5% on average at Exh). To assess central mechanisms potentially responsible for the MVC reduction, we used the twitch interpolation technique that, despite some debates (Taylor, 2009 ), remains the gold standar d to assess muscle voluntary activation (Gandevia, 2001 ). The QIF test leads to some impairment of the maximal ability to activate the quadriceps as shown by the decrease of VA Db and VA tw (- 5% on average at Exh). Previous observations also indicated that submaximal isometric intermittent contractions induce only minor reduction in VA (Bilodeau, 2006 ). The slight reduction in VA indicates that the reduction in MVC was mostly due to contractile fatigue. All together, these results confirm that our procedure is suitable to evaluate both peripheral and central factors of NMF. However, VA calculation does not provide information regarding the m echanisms underlying central fatigue. Other techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (Todd, Taylor et al. 2003) , would be necessary to distinguish, for instance, spinal and supraspinal mechanisms (Gandevia, 2001 ). Reliability Endurance assessed by the total number of submaximal contractions showed a strong agreement among sessions and thus can be considered as a valid index for endurance performance. At Pre, MVCs and evoked quadriceps strength showed excellent agreement with no systemati c bias (CV TE CV < 7 % and ICC > 0.88, Table 2). Concerning fatigue PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 95 level measured at 50% set, MVC showed strong reliability (CV TE of 5.6 % and ICC of 0.75, Table 3) and evoked strength showed excellent reliability (CV TE < 7 % and ICC > 0.88, Table 3). Simi larly, MVCs and evoked responses were strongly reliable at Exh (CV TE < 7 % and ICC > 0.86, Table 3). At Post 30, the reliability of these variables was slightly smaller and this could be explained by some changes in subjects' position. Tw p was as reliable as Db 10:100, indicating Tw p can be used as a valid index of peripheral fatigue in clinical or laboratory settings allowing single stimulation only. VA was slightly higher (+2 %; P = 0.005) at Pre for QIF2 when considering VA Db (but not VA Tw), indicating a systematic bias in this measurement that could be attributed to a learning effect. Similar tendencies have been revealed in another reliability study from Place et al. (2007 ). These results may be explained b y the subjects' lack of experience in strength measurements and FNMS procedures. Thus, repeating Pre -assessment twice could be proposed as an alternative to smooth this effect as suggested by Clark et al. (2007). Both VA Db and VA tw appeared to be sensiti ve indexes to assess central fatigue since they decreased significantly over the QIF test. Absolute reliability appeared to be good (CV TE < 6.6%). However, relative reliability assessed with the LOA technique leads to significant variability (up to 14% at set 50%). LOA must be cautiously interpreted because it can be highly increased due to a very few outliers in that population size (see Fig 5). These data are in agreement with previous findings on VA variability in healthy subjects (Shield and Zhou, 2004 ; O'Brien et al., 2008 ) and should allow clear detection of central activation failure as observed in various neurological diseases (Allen et al., 1994 ; Skurvydas et al., 2011 ). Sensitivity to sex differences The QIF test revealed a significant sex differences regarding quadriceps endurance and fatigability. Females showed a greater tot al number of contractions and a lower level of peripheral low frequency fatigue, both for a given set and at exhaustion (Fig. 6). These differences illustrate an important advantage of the QIF test for comparing NMF between subjects having different MVC le vels (as males and females), i.e. fatigue is assessed for the same amount of work (relative to MVC) and can therefore provide a relevant index of muscle fatigability for various populations. No significant differences of VA changes were found indicating th at sex differences in fatigue were mostly due to peripheral factors. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 96 These data emphasized previous findings regarding sex differences in neuromuscular fatigue mechanism (Clark et al., 2005 ; Yoon et al., 2007 ; Hunter, 2009 ; Keller et al., 2011 ). Theref ore, the sensitivity of the QIF test to small inter individual differences such as sex-differences is promising regarding its ability to detect alterations in patients as well as changes over time. Relevance of the QIF test Our results showed that whole b ody endurance assessed on a maximal incremental cycling test was not related to muscular endurance assessed with the QIF test. These observations emphasized the need for a specific evaluation of the muscular endurance with a minimal influence of cardio -pulmonary factors. Maximal voluntary strength or evoked muscular responses by FMNS at Pre were not correlated to fatigability and endurance, indicating the need for a global evaluation of NMF. We showed that strength loss at set 50% ( i.e. fatigability) was co rrelated to endurance performance. Thus, peripheral fatigue assessed with evoked muscular responses via FNMS over the QIF test can be used as a predictor of muscle endurance. Consequently, using peripheral fatigue level rather than the total number of sub -maximal contractions could minimize the influence of motivational and other psychological factors in patients. Methodological issues VA Tw appeared to be less sensitive than VA Db to drops in VA since it was significantly reduces at Exh only (see Fig. 4). The same tendency has been previously reported by Place et al. (2007 ). However, in our protocol, VA Tw assessment was performed during a MVC maneuver that followed 15 s of rest, which is not a negligible recove ry period. This may explain, a least in part, small differences between VA db and VA tw. Thus, we suggest that VA Tw measurement should be performed on the first MVC when only one magnetic stimulator is available. None of our subjects were overweight (BMI < 25 kg.m-2) allowing supramaximality of FNMS. We recently showed that the capacity of FNMS to deliver supramaximal stimulation is altered when fat thickness below the coil increases (Tomazin et al., 2011 ). Thus, special caution should be taken when studying subjects with high body fat PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE I 97 percentage. Researchers should also be confident than the material used for FNMS is adapted (Tomazin et al., 2010 ). A potential critique of the QIF test is th at the subject is required to generate true maximal MVC to set force levels during sets of submaximal contractions. In patients with impaired VA (such as arthrogenous muscle inhibition caused by pain (Machner et al., 2002 ) or neurological diseases (Skurvydas et al., 201 1)), force levels during sets could be calculated from the theoretical MVC ( i.e. extrapolated from the measured VA at Pre). CONCLUSION The present study showed that this innovative neuromuscular evaluation based on a quadriceps isometric intermittent fa tigue test with femoral nerve magnetic stimulation is feasible and well -tolerated. The reliability of strength, endurance and fatigability appeared to be satisfactory. The test also showed its ability to detect sex differences in endurance and fatigue sugg esting its sensitivity to small inter -individual differences. Therefore, the QIF test appears to be a promising tool for neuromuscular investigation. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate its feasibility and reliability in patients .

CONFLICT -OF-INTEREST None RUNNING TITLE Aging and training effects on fatigue PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 117 ABSTR ACT In situ assessment of ne uromuscular strength, endurance and fatigue remains challenging. We used a specific procedure with femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) to assess the influence of aging and training status on quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigue. Twenty four male subjects (8 young endurance -trained (30\u00b13 yr ; Young -Tr), 8 young untrained (26\u00b14 yr ; Young -UnTr) and 8 middle -aged untrained (56\u00b14 yr ; Old-UnTr) performed a maximal cycling test in order to confirm their training status. On a separated visit, FNMS was used to evaluate central and peripheral factors of quadriceps function . Subjects performed sets of 10 intermittent (5 -s on/5 -s off) isometric contractions starting contraction (MVC) , with 10% MVC increment from one set to another until exhaustion. Neuromuscular fatigue was assessed with FNMS before the fatiguing test and after each set. Young -UnTr exhibited larger reduction in evoked quadriceps mechanical responses during quadriceps contractions (e.g. at set 50% MVC, reduction in single potentiated twitch was - 36\u00b19%) Young -Tr Similar number of contractions and reduction in maximal voluntary activation were observed in Young -UnTr and Old -UnTr. Young -Tr performed more contr actions compared to Young -UnTr without changes in maximal voluntary activation throughout the test. The present testing procedure using FNMS is able to detect the effect of aging and training status on the main components of the neuromuscular function . We confirmed the lower peripheral fatigability associated with aging and highly endurance -trained status. No effect of aging on central fatigue was observed while highly -trained subjects did not shown central fatigue, even at exhaustion and despite greater en durance performance, suggesting distinct reasons for task failure compared to untrained subjects during this exercise protocol. Keywords: strength; endurance; ETUDE II 118 INTRODUCTION Paragraph Number 1. In situ assessments of muscle strength, fatigue, and endurance in human are always challenging. In the past decades, studies using artificially evoked muscular responses by electrical stimulation have substantially contributed to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying muscle strength and fatigue (30). Magnetic neurostimulation (33) has been recently shown to provide similar results than standard electrical neurostimulation (45) and to have several advantages particularly regarding tolerance (18, 43 ). Quadriceps dysfunction has been identified as a major factor contributing to exercise intolerance and disability in various pathological conditions (17, 31, 38) and in the elderly (40). To provide a comprehensive and clinically useful tool for the evalu ation and follow -up (including post therapy) of this muscle group, we recently validated a test assessing quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigability in a single session (Quadriceps Intermittent Fatigue test: QIF (5)). We recently addressed the reliabi lity of our procedure in healthy subjects na\u00efve from any neuromuscular evaluation procedure and its ability to detect inter individual variations related to sex differences (5). We also showed that this procedure was well -tolerated and able to detect perip heral impairments in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (4), confirming its usefulness for clinical purposes. Paragraph Number 2. Neuromuscular function is also critically influenced by aging and training status. Changes in contractile apparatus associate d with aging ( e.g. muscle mass loss (34), motor unit remodeling (28), altered metabolic capacity and slowed contractile properties (35)) are well documented and their influences on muscle performance have been extensively studied (2). However, many studies failed to adequately take into account confounding effects related to sex differences (9, 20) and training status (2) when comparing young and older subjects. In addition, the use of different types of contraction (e.g. isometric versus dynamic, sustained versus intermittent (3), voluntary versus artificially -induced (20)) and methodological differences in neuromuscular function assessments ( e.g. uncomfortable tetanic electrical stimulation (22) versus single twitch or doublets stimulation (7)), might expl ain disparate results. Data concerning the effect of aging on central fatigue are particularly controversial (24, 37, 41, 47) . Mechanisms of muscle adaptations (15) and changes in strength and endurance induced by various training regimes within various gr oups of subjects have been extensively studied (13, 36) . However, the literature comparing neuromuscular strength, fatigue and endurance of PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 119 highly trained and untrained subjects is surprisingly scarce (1, 19, 27) . Whether these populations may show similar differences as those observed in longitudinal studies investigating the effect of training remains to be clarified. In particular, the effect of training status on peripheral versus central fatigability and on the amount of fatigue associated with task fa ilure need to be investigated. Paragraph Number 3. The first aim of the present study was to address the influence of aging and training status on quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigue using a specific procedure with FNMS as recently designed by our t eam (4, 5) . We compared the quadriceps neuromuscular function of young versus old untrained subjects and of young trained versus untrained subjects. We tested the following hypothesis : i) young endurance - trained subjects may exhibit smaller peripheral and central fatigue for a given amount of work but similar levels of fatigue at exhaustion compared to young untrained subjects , ii) young untrained subjects may exhibit greater peripheral fatigue and smaller endurance than older untrained subjects but smaller central fatigue . PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 120 METHODS Subjects Paragraph Number 4. Twenty four male subjects (8 young endurance -trained (Young -Tr), 8 young untrained (Young -UnTr) and 8 middle -aged untrained (Old -UnTr) volunteered to participate in the study and gave written inform ed consent. Their main characteristics are presented in Table 1. All subjects were free from any neuromuscular, metabolic and cardiorespiratory disorders. Young -Tr subjects were triathletes of regional or national levels training at least twelve hours per week. Young -UnTr and Old -UnTr performed less than 3 hours of physical activity per week. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local Committee on Human Research (Comit\u00e9 de protection des personnes Sud -EST V). Study design Paragraph Number 5. After inclusion, subjects performed two exercise test sessions. During the first visit, subjects had clinical examination, anthropometric measurements and they performed a maximal incremental exercise test on a cycle er gometer. On the second session, subjects performed a quadriceps fatigue test. Maximal cycling test Paragraph Number 6. Subjects performed a standard maximal incremental exercise test on a computer -controlled electrically braked cycle ergometer (Ergometrics 800, Ergoline, Bitz, breath -by-breath gas analysis and electrocardiogram (Medisoft, Dinant, Belgium) for the determination of peak workload (W peak) and peak oxygen consumption (VO 2,peak) (6). Initial power was set at 40W for 2min in Young -UnTr and Old-UnTr and 80W in Young -Tr. We used 15 W.min-1 increment in Young -UnTr and Old - UnTr and 25W.min-1 increment in Young -Tr. A fingertip blood sample was obtained 3 min after exhaustion and analyzed for lactate concentration (NOVA+, Nova Biomedical Corporation, Waltham MA). Quadriceps intermittent fatigue test PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 121 Paragraph Number 7. Experimental setup. Measurements were conducted on the right limb for all subjects. Subjects lay supine on a customized chair. The knee was flexed at 90\u00b0 and the hip angle wa s 130\u00b0 for to facilitate coil placement in the femoral triangle for FNMS. Voluntary strength and evoked responses to FNMS were measured with a strain gauge (SBB 200kg Tempo Technologies, Taipei, Taiwan) connected to an inextensible ankle strap. Compensator y movement of the upper body was limited by two belts across the thorax and abdomen. Subjects were instructed to keep their hands on their abdomen at all times. Visual feedback of both the force produced and the target force levels (see below) was provided to the subjects. Paragraph Number 8. Femoral Nerve Magnetic Stimulation (FNMS). FNMS was performed with a 45 -mm figure -eight coil powered by two Magstim 200 stimulators (peak magnetic eld 2.5 T, stimulation duration 0.1 ms; Magstim, Whitland, United Kingdom) linked with a Bistim Module (Magstim). We used single stimulations (twitch) and paired stimulations (10 Hz and 100 Hz doublets) given at maximum stimulator output. The coil was positioned high in the femoral triangle in regard to the femoral nerve. Optimal stimulation site allowing maximal unpotentiated quadriceps peak strength (T wu) as well as maximum vastus lateralis M-wave amplitude (M ampl) (see below) and supramaximality was carefully checked after a 20 min rest with decreasing stimulator power output (100%, 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%). Tw u and M ampl were not significantly reduced u ntil 80% of the maximal power output in all subjects, confirming FNMS supramaximality as previously reported in our laboratory (45). Paragraph Number 9. Quadriceps surface EMG signal was recorded from the vastus lateralis (as a surrogate for the whole qu adriceps (32)) as described in detail previously (45). EMG signals were amplied (BioAmp, ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia ) with a 5 to 500 Hz filter. EMG and force signals were digitized (Powerlab, ADInstruments) at a sampling frequency of 2,000 Hz recorded (Labchart; ADInstruments). Paragraph Number 10. QIF test . Before starting the initial neuromuscular assessment, subjects performed ten 5 -s submaximal quadriceps contractions in order to warm up the quadriceps muscle and to familiarize themselves with the visual feedback and the soundtrack instruction s (see below). Then subjects performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with 1 min of rest between each MVC (32). After these MVCs PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 122 providing full muscle potentiation (26), the initial neuromuscular assessment (Pre) was performed. It included a 5 -s MVC superimposed with a 100 Hz doublet (Db 100,s) and followed after 2 s ( i.e. on relaxed muscle) by two potentiated doublets at 100 Hz (Db 100) and 10 Hz (Db 10) performed 4 s apart. After 15 seconds of rest, the subject performed a second MVC followed aft er 2 s by one potentiated twitch (Tw p). During all MVCs, subjects were vigorously encouraged by the experimenter. Evoked high and low frequency paired stimulation provides an extensive understanding of peripheral fatigue ( e.g. high and low frequency periph eral fatigue) (45) and high frequency superimposed stimulation, provides suitable assessment of central activation assessment (32). Paragraph Number 11. After Pre assessment, sets of 10 intermittent (5 -s on / 5 -s off) isometric contractions at submaximal t arget forces were performed, starting at 10% MVC for the first set and increasing by 10% MVC each set until task failure. Subjects had visual feedback of the target force level and listened to a soundtrack indicating the contraction - relaxation rhythm. The range used for the target force level was defined as \u00b12.5% of MVC. Task failure was defined as two consecutive contractions below the target force level for more than 2.5 s. Five seconds after the end of each 10 -contraction set and at exhaustion (Exh), neu romuscular assessments similar to Pre assessment were performed. Data Analysis Paragraph Number 12 . The following parameters were calculated from the mechanical responses to FNMS: peak force for Tw u, Tw p, Db 100, Db100,s and Db 10 as well as the ratio Db10 over Db 100 (Db 10:100). Peak to peak M -waves amplitude, duration and area were calculated from potentiated single stimulation. We also reported maximal rate of maximal force development (MRFD) and relaxation (MRFR) and the contraction time in Tw p. Voluntary activation (VA) was calculated as follows from the high -frequency doublets: VA = [1 -(Db 100,s / Db 100)] \u00d7100 A correction was applied to the original equation when the superimposed stimulation was administrated slightly before or after the real peak MVC (42). Paragraph Number 1 3. The following parameters were calculated from submaximal contractions: mean force , force -time product, signal PARTIE II: ETUDE II 123 normalized with M ampl (RMS/M). We expressed the increase of RMS/M during each 10 - contract ion as percentage increase between the mean three first and the mean three last contractions of each set. Statistical analysis Paragraph Number 1 4. All variables are reported as mean (standard deviation (SD)) within text and tables. Normal distribution and homogeneity of variances analysis were confirmed using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov and Skewness test, respectively. Unpaired t - tests were conducted to compare Young -UnTr versus Young -Tr and Young -UnTr versus Old-UnTr for the following variables: subject charac teristics, questionnaire scores and neuromuscular function at Pre. To compare changes in variables during the QIF test, we used one way ANOVA for repeated measurements and t -tests with Bonferroni's correction for post -hoc analysis within each group since t he number of sets completed by Young - UnTr, Old -UnTr and Young -Tr subjects was different. To compare changes over the sets completed by all groups, we used two two -way repeated measures ANOVAs (time \u00d7 group) and t -tests with Bonferroni's correction for post -hoc analysis. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine relationship between variables ( i.e. between quadriceps neuromuscular function and cycling exercise responses). The alpha level was set at 0.05 for all tests. Statistical analysis was perf ormed with a statistical Contribution Maximal cycling test Paragraph Number 1 5. Main results from the maximal cycling test are shown in Table 1. As expected, Young -Tr had higher W peak and VO 2,peak than Young -UnTr subje cts and Young -UnTr had higher W peak and VO 2,max than Old-UnTr. Blood lactate concentration 3 min after exhaustion were 8 mmol.l-1 and maximum heart rate was 90% of the theoretical value for all subjects confirming the maximality of the incremental cyclin g test in all subjects. Quadriceps function at Pre Paragraph Number 1 6. Quadriceps neuromuscular function is shown in Table 2. Compared to Young -UnTr, volitional and evoked strength, either as absolute values and normalized to body weight, were greater in Young -Tr and smaller in Old -UnTr. Higher Tw p MRFD were observed in Young -Tr compared to Young -UnTr but this difference did not exist anymore when normalized to Tw p (data not shown; all P>0.05). Lower Tw p MRFD and MRFR were observed in Old -UnTr compared to Young -UnTr and theses differences were persistent when normalized to Tw p (10.6\u00b11.8 versus 8.8\u00b11.3 for MRFD and -4.06\u00b10.6 versus in Young -UnTr and Old , respectively). Compared to Young -UnTr, M -wave amplitude and area were smaller in Old-UnTr and similar Young -Tr. Db10:100 was lower in Young -Tr compared to Young -UnTr but similar in Young -UnTr and Old -UnTr. Compared to Young -UnTr, VA was higher in Young -Tr and similar in Old -UnTr. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 125 Quadriceps fatigue Paragraph Number 1 7. Endurance an d muscular work. Compared to Young -UnTr (59\u00b16 ), the total number of submaximal contractions was greater in Young -Tr (81\u00b18; P<0.001) and similar in Old -UnTr (59\u00b111; P=0.95). The ratio of the last submaximal contraction and the first following MVC at Exh was similar in Young -UnTr (0.99\u00b10.13) compared to Young - Tr (1.00\u00b10.06, (0.95\u00b10.08, and evoked responses . Changes in MVC and evoked muscular responses (Tw p, Db 100, Db 10:100) during the quadriceps fa tigue test are shown in Figure 1 . Young -UnTr exhibited greater reduction in MVC, Tw p and Db 100 compared to Young -Tr and Old -UnTr. No significant change over time was found in M -wave characteristics in all groups (all P>0.05; data not shown). Changes in RMS/M dur ing sets of submaximal contractions are shown in Figure 2. Young -UnTr exhibit greater and earlier rise in RMS/M than Young -Tr and Old -UnTr. From Exh to Post30, Young -UnTr showed a significant recovery in evoked responses while these parameters remained sta ble in Young - Tr and Old -UnTr. Paragraph Number 19 . Voluntary activation . Changes in VA are shown in Figure 3. Young -UnTr and Young -Tr had a significant reduction in VA at the end of the test while Young -Tr subjects did not. No significant differences were found for VA between Young - UnTr and Young -Tr (P=0.84) and between 126 DISCUSSION Paragraph Number 20 . Significant influences of aging and training status on quadriceps strength, fatigue and endurance have been observed by u sing a test involving FNMS as recently proposed by our group, further suggesting that this procedure may be a useful tool for neuromuscular evaluation. In support of our first hypothesis, Young -UnTr exhibited more peripheral fatigue than Old -UnTr after iso metric contractions at similar force levels relative to their respective maximal volitional strength. Conversely, similar endurance and central fatigue were observed in Young -UnTr and Old -UnTr. In support of our second hypothesis, Young -Tr showed smaller a mount of peripheral fatigability for contractions at identical relative force levels and larger endurance compared to Young -UnTr while they did not exhibit significant central fatigue throughout the test. Interestingly , Young -Tr exhibited less peripheral f atigue at Exh than Young -UnTr. Age-related differences Paragraph Number Young -UnTr and Old -UnTr had similar VO 2,peak as percentage of predicted value (Table 1) indicating that differences observed in quadriceps fatigue were related to age differences a nd not to differences in training status. Paragraph Number 22 . Quadriceps function at Pre. Volitional and evoked strength either absolute or normalized to body weight were ~30% smaller in Old -UnTr compared to Young -UnTr. Old -UnTr exhibited similar ability to reach high VA levels ( i.e. >90%) similar to Young -UnTr subjects. Similar results on the quadriceps were reported in older (~80 years) subjects (37), supporting that the contribution of central activation failure to reduced maximal strength in older su bjects may be limited (2, 24) . Similar VA and lower volitional or evoked strength in Old -UnTr compared to Young -UnTr might be mainly related to the well -known sarcopenia associated with aging (16). Old-UnTr subjects exhibit lower MRFD and MRFR either as absolute values or normalized to Tw p amplitude, indicating a slowing of muscle contractile properties (2). This slowing may be related to a loss of type II motor units and/or atrophy of type II fibers (23, 37) . Decreased efficiency of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ relea se might also be involved in this slowing contractility (25). As previously observed (39), Old -UnTr also exhibited smaller M -wave that may be due, at least in part, to motor unit remodeling (28) and greater body fat percentage . PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 127 Quadri ceps function during the quadriceps fatigue test. Old-UnTr exhibited lower reduction in MVC and evoked strength ( i.e. Tw p and Db 100) than Young - UnTr. In addition, Young -UnTr had a greater reduction in Db 10:100 suggesting a larger amount of low frequency fa tigue during the test and at Exh. The absence of significant alteration of M -wave characteristics in both groups excludes the involvement of neuromuscular propagation failure. These findings are consistent with the data from a recent meta -analysis concerni ng the effect of aging on peripheral fatigue of knee extensors indicating reduced muscle fatigability in older subjects (8), at least during isometric loading . Lower rise in RMS/M was observed in Old -UnTr compared to Young -UnTr during the last submaximal contraction set, probably due to lower amount of peripheral fatigue in Old -UnTr. Reductions in VA were similar in both groups suggesting that, contrary to peripheral fatigability, central fatig ability may not be different in Old -UnTr compared to Young -UnTr . This is in accordance with the study of Kent -Braun et al. (24) that reported no effect of aging on VA reduction of ankle dorsiflexors during a isometric task similar to the present study. The effects of aging on central fatigue has been assessed in vario us other muscle groups ( e.g. tibialis anterior (44), plantar flexor (29), elbow flexor (47)) with contrasting results probably due to the variety of stimulation protocols, the nature of the fatiguing task and the age of the subjects. In a recent study, Yoo n et al. (48) used transcranial magnetic stimulation and reported no effect of age on central fatigue during both isometric and dynamic loading. Further studies are needed to clarify this discrepancy regarding the effect of aging on central fatigue. Surpri singly, similar endurance ( i.e. the total number of submaximal contractions) was observed in young and older subjects while greater endurance may have been expected considering the lower peripheral fatigability in Old -UnTr. Since the reduction in VA at Exh and the ratio of the last submaximal contraction and the first following MVC were similar in both groups, central factors (including motivation) do not seem to explain this result. The twitch interpolation technique may however present some limitations to detect small differences in voluntary activation (11). Our results also showed that Young -UnTr exhibited greater changes in evoked responses from Exh to Post 30 suggesting a greater recovery than Old - UnTr. Greater proportion of fast type motor units in Yo ung-UnTr (28) and delayed recovery of motor units in Old -UnTr (10) might explain, at least in part, this result (14). However, recovery in VA was similar in Young -UnTr and Old -UnTr and these results do not corroborate previous findings of delayed recovery of neural centers with aging (21, 47, PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 128 49). Small amount of central fatigue induced by the fatiguing protocol used in the present study might explain, in part, this result. Training status -related differences Paragraph Number 2 4. Quadriceps function at Pre. Volitional and evoked strength either absolute or normalized to body weight were ~20% greater and VA was slightly larger in Young -Tr compared to Young -UnTr confirming that greater strength in highly -trained subjects relies on both peripheral and central n euromuscular adaptations. This is in accordance with previous findings on the soleus in trained subjects (19) and with findings on exercise -induced neuromuscular plasticity (15). Db10:100 was greater in Young -Tr compared to Young -UnTr. Similar values were observed in trained subjects in previous works (12) but the underlying mechanisms remained to be determined. Paragraph Number 2 5. Quadriceps function during the quadriceps fatigue test. Slower and smaller reductions in both volitional and evoked muscular r esponses in highly -trained compared to untrained subjects might be partly related to a greater reliance on non - oxidative sources of ATP in Young -UnTr. Lower inorganic phosphate accumulation may be a critical mechanism underlying smaller contractile impair ments in Young -Tr subjects (46). Smaller peripheral fatigue was also supported by the kinetics of EMG signal during submaximal contractions showing a delayed and depressed increase in RMS/M over the sets of submaximal contraction s (see Fig. 3). Young -Tr ex hibited greater endurance, which is consistent with smaller muscle fatigability. However, smaller peripheral fatigue was observed at Exh in Young -Tr compared to Young -UnTr. Although this result was unexpected, it may be explained by the incremental design of the fatiguing task, leading to the occurrence of task -failure at a large percentage of MVC in Young -Tr. At such very high level of strength, subjects might not be able to perform the task due to factors other than peripheral fatigue, e.g. muscle and/or join discomfort. Compared to Young -UnTr, Young -Tr did not exhibit a significant decrease in VA at Exh suggesting a reduced propensity to develop central fatigue in highly -trained subjects during this kind of exercise. Since reductions in VA were not signif icantly different at Exh between both groups, the effect of training status on central fatigue remains to be confirmed in further studies using alternative measurements of central fatigue such as transcranial and cervicomedullary magnetic stimulations. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE II 129 CONCLUSION Paragraph Number 2 6. To conclude, the present study showed that our test involving incremental intermittent isometric contraction and repetitive assessments of neuromuscular fatigue with FNMS is able to detect neuromuscular differences associated w ith aging and training status. In addition to confirm the lower peripheral fatigability associated with aging and highly -trained status under isometric loading , our results showed that central fatigue was similar in young and older subjects while no signif icant activation failure was observed in young trained subjects . The QIF test associated with FNMS appears to be a reliable and sensitive ( i.e. to sex -differences (5), aging and training status) tool for quadriceps neuromuscular assessment that may be usef ul for observational and longitudinal studies.

To compare patients with healthy controls. Methods: Controls performed the test once and controls twice on two separate visits. It consisted of incremental sets of 10 contr actions starting at 10% of maximal voluntary contraction until exhaustion. Results: Supramaximal FNMS could not be achieved in ~30% of FSHD patients and in none CMT patients. FNMS appeared to reliable to assess both central (typical error expressed as a c oefficient of variation (CVTE)<8% for voluntary activation) and peripheral (CVTE<10% and intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC)>0.85 for evoked responses) function in remaining FSHD patients before and during the test. Volitional strength and endurance a ssessments were reliable (CVTE<6% and ICC>0.87). Patients exhibit similar neuromuscular fatigability and endurance compared to controls. Conclusion: Our test appeared to be a valuable tool for interventional studies. However FNMS exhibits limitations due t o insufficient stimulation intensity. Central and peripheral quadriceps fatigability is not enhanced in patients during this test. Significance: Further development of magnetic stimulation device is needed to extend its applicability. Keywords: Fascioscap ulohumeral Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 143 HIGHLIGHTS Our procedure can provide re liable assessment of quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigue in patients with neuromuscul ar disease in a single session. FNMS exhibits limitations due to insufficient stimulation intensity, especially in patients with neurogenic conditions Patients with fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease exhibit similar neuromuscular central and peripheral fatigability compared to healthy controls during standardized isolated quadriceps contractions. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 144 INTRODUCTION In patients with neuromuscula r disorders, muscle weakness leads to severe impairment of functional capacities with negative influence on physical activity and participation. Experienced fatigue ( i.e. tiredness, lack of energy and feeling of exhaustion not necessarily induced by exerci se) is a common symptom in neuromuscular diseases (Chaudhuri and Behan, 2004 ; Angelini and Tasca, 2012 ). In addition to muscle weakness, enhanced subjective muscle fatigability is also reported by patients (Feasson et al., 2006 ). Availability of reliable an d well -tolerated non -invasive evaluation of neuromuscular function ( i.e. strength, endurance and fatigue) in patients with neuromuscular disorders is critical to provide relevant outcomes for observational and interventional studies. Muscle strength outpu t embraces mechanisms within all levels of the motor pathway from the brain to skeletal muscle and are classically classified as central (neural) or peripheral (muscular). Similarly, neuromuscular fatigue ( i.e. exercise -induced reduction in voluntary stren gth (Bigland -Ritchie et al., 1978 )) involves peripheral ( i.e. exercise -induced reduction in muscle contractility) and central mechanis ms (i.e. exercise -induced reduction in muscle activation during voluntary contractions caused by a decreased in motoneurons output at the spinal or/and supraspinal level (Gandevia, 2001 )). Procedures to assess maximal voluntary strength are well doc umented in both healthy subjects (Hogrel et al., 2007 ) and patients (Horemans et al., 2004 ) but exhibit numerous limitations ( e.g. effects of patient cooperation/motivation, fear of pain or muscle damage, joint dysfunction and lack of distinction between central and peripheral factors). To overcome these limitati ons, artificially mechanical and electrophysiological responses evoked via muscle or peripheral nerve stimulation can be used to assess peripheral strength and the degree of muscle activation before and throughout a fatiguing task (see Millet et al. (2012b ) for review). However, the lack of standardized procedures concerning stimulations patterns and fatiguing muscle loading often makes results difficult to interpret. For instance, Schillings et al. (2007 ) used direct electrical muscle stimulation to assess biceps brachii muscle function in patients with myogenic or neurogenic disorders. The authors reported impaired voluntary activation a t rest and smaller peripheral fatigue in patients (i.e. smaller reduction in evoked muscular responses compared to healthy controls) following a 2 -min sustained maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC). In this work, interactions between impaired init ial activation level leading to a lower exercise intensity in patients during the PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 145 2-min MVC might explained lower peripheral fatigue in patients compared to controls. In addition, the use of uncomfortable 100Hz electrical stimulation train is potentially responsible for submaximal activation in patients and the use of submaximal unpotentiated (rather than supramaximal potentiated) evoked responses also raised methodological concerns while assessing peripheral fatigue (Kufel et al., 2002 ; Millet et al., 2012b ). We recently developed a new clinical to assess quadriceps function (Quadriceps Intermittent Fatigu e test: QIF) involving intermittent isometric contractions and repetitive neuromuscular assessment via femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS, i.e. providing similar results compared to electrical stimulation as recently showed by our team (Verges et al., 2009 ) and appearing to be better tolerated in patients (Szecsi et al., 2010 )). The design of the QIF test has the advantage to i) provide a kinetic of central and peripheral fatigue rather than a final measurement at exhaustion only, ii) limit the influence of psychological -motivational confounding factors using progressive loading and multiple assessments, iii) limit the discomfort induced by stimulations using single and doublets stimuli rather than stimulation trains. We showed that the QIF test was reliable in healthy subjects (Bachasson et al., 2012a ) and that it can be successfully used in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (Bachasson et al., 2012b ). To our knowledge, the reliability of a comprehensive procedure to assess quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigue with the support of FNMS in patients with neuromuscular diseases is yet to be addressed. Accordingly, we evaluated the feasibility and the reliability of the QIF test in patients with neuromuscular disorders. We studied patients with fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) and patients with Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), two of t he most frequent genetically inherited muscular dystrophy and polyneuropathy in adults, respectively. We hypothesized that i) FNMS and the QIF test are safe and reliable in patients with neuromuscular disorders, ii) patients with neuromuscular disorders ha ve larger peripheral and central fatigue during the QIF test compared to a group of healthy controls. To clarify the functional consequences of muscle dysfunction in patients, we also assessed the relationship between quadriceps function, exercise capacity , functional capacities and experienced fatigue assessed by questionnaires. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 146 METHODS Subjects Nineteen FSHD patients (type IA) and eight CMT (type IA) patients with confirmed genetic diagnosis and twenty -three healthy controls volunteered to participate in this study. FSHD and CMT patients groups were compared with two groups of healthy controls (n=19 and n=8) matched for age, gender and BMI. Main subjects characteristics are presented in Table 1. All patients were able to walk and had neither contra -indica tion for maximal exercise testing nor severe knee condition. All subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in this study. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki with approval from the local Committee on Human Res earch ( Comit\u00e9 de protection des personnes Sud -EST V ). Study design During the first visit, patients and controls had a clinical examination and answered questionnaires. During the second visit, subjects performed a 6 -min walk test and, after one hour of re st, they performed a maximal incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer. During the third visit, subjects performed a QIF test. Twelve FSHD patients and all CMT patients had a fourth visit to repeat the QIF test in order to assess between -day reliabili ty. Anthropometric measurements Body fat percentage was assessed from four skinfolds (Durnin and Womersley, 1974 ). We estimated quadriceps volume based on a truncated cone calculation using three thigh circumferences and thigh skinfold (Jones and Pearson, 1969 ). Questionnaires Quality of life was evaluated with the Medical Outcomes Study Short -Form (SF -36) (Aaronson et al., 1992 ). Experienced fatigue was evaluated with the fatigue severity scale (Krupp et al., 1989 ). PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 147 Maximal cycling test Subjects performed a standard maximal incremental exercise test on a computer -controlled electrically braked cycle ergo meter (Ergometrics 800, Ergoline, Bitz, with -by-breath gas analysis and electrocardiogram (Medisoft, Dinant, Belgium) (Balady et al., 2010 ) for the determination of peak workload and peak oxygen consumption (VO 2,peak). A fingertip blood sample was obtained 3 min after exhaustion and analyzed for lactate concentration (NOVA+, Nova Biomedical Corporation, Waltham MA, USA). Quadriceps neuromuscular assessment Experimental setup. Measurements were conducted on the right limb in controls and on the strongest limb in patients. Subjects lay supine on a customized chair. The knee was flexed at 90\u00b0 and the hip angle was 130\u00b0 to facilitate coil placement i n the femoral triangle for FNMS. Voluntary strength and evoked responses to FNMS were measured with a strain gauge (SBB 200kg Tempo Technologies, Taipei, Taiwan) connected to an inextensible ankle strap. Compensatory movement of the upper body was limited by two belts across the thorax and abdomen. Subjects were instructed to keep their hands on their abdomen at all times. Visual feedback of both the force produced and the target force levels (see below) was provided to the subjects. Quadriceps surface EMG signal was recorded from the vastus lateralis (as a surrogate for the whole quadriceps (Place et al., 2007 )) as described in details previously (Verges et a 5 to filter. EMG and force signals were digitized (Powerlab, ADInstruments) at a sampling frequency of Femoral Nerve Magnetic 45 -mm figure -eight coil powered by two Magstim 200 stimulators (peak magnetic eld 2.5 T, stimulation duration 0.1 ms; Magstim, Whitland, United Kingdom) linked by Bistim Module (Magstim), as previously described (Verges et al., 2009 ). Single (twitch) and paired stimuli (10Hz and 100Hz doublets) were delivered at maximal stimulator output. The coil was posi tioned high in the femoral triangle in regard to the femoral nerve. The optimal position to evoke maximal unpotentiated and maximal vastus lateralis M-wave amplitude was determined and skin. After PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 148 20 min of rest , stimulus supramaximality was assessed at stimulator power outputs of 100, 95, 90, 85 and 80% (see Fig. 1). FNMS was considered as supramaximal when Tw u at 80% of maximal power output was below 90% of Tw u at 100% of maximal power output. This supramaximal ity threshold corresponding to the twice of Tw u variability, allowing supramaximal stimulation necessary to avoid the confounding effect of nerve hyperpolarization induced by muscle fatigue (Millet et al., 2012a ). QIF test. Before starting the initial neuromuscular assessment, subjects performed ten 5 -s submaximal isometric quadriceps contractions i n order to warm up the quadriceps muscle and to familiarize themselves with both visual feedback and soundtrack instructions (see below). Then subjects performed three MVCs with 1 min of rest between each MVC. Following these MVC, subjects performed four s ubmaximal contractions at 20, 40, 60 and 80% of MVC, each with a 100Hz doublet delivered during contraction in order to evaluate the strength -activation relationship (See Fig. 2). Then the baseline neuromuscular assessment was performed. It consisted of a 5-s MVC superimposed with 100Hz doublet followed 2 s later ( i.e. in relaxed muscle) by two potentiated doublets at 100Hz (Db 100) and 10Hz (Db 10) delivered 4 s apart. Fifteen seconds later the subject performed a second MVC followed after 2 s by one potenti ated single twitch (Tw p). During all MVCs, subjects were vigorously encouraged by the experimenter. Potentiated (Kufel et al., 2002 ) evoked high - and low -frequency paired stimuli allow assessments of both high - and low -frequency peripheral fatigue (Verges et al., 2009 ) and high -frequency superimposed stimuli provide optimal resolution for central activation assessment (Place et al., 2007 ). After baseline assessment, sets of 10 interm ittent (5 -s on / 5 -s off) isometric contractions at submaximal target forces were performed, starting at 10% MVC for the first set and increasing by 10% MVC each set until task failure. Subjects had visual feedback of the target force level and listened to a soundtrack indicating the contraction -relaxation rhythm. The range used for the target force level was defined as \u00b1 2.5% of MVC. Task failure was defined as two consecutive contractions below the target force level for more than 2.5 s. Five seconds after the end of each 10 -contraction set and at exhaustion (Exh), neuromuscular assessments were performed similarly to baseline assessments. In FSHD patients, serum creatine kinase was measured before and 24 hours after the test. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 149 Data Analysis The following parameters were calculated from the mechanical responses to FNMS: peak force for Tw u, Tw p, Db 100, superimposed Db 100, Db 10 and the ratio Db 10:Db 100 (Db 10:100 as an index of low frequency peripheral fatigue). Peak -to-peak M -wave amplitude, area and latency (from FNMS to first M -wave peak) were calculated from Tw p to assess possible alterations of action potential propagation (Dimitrova and Dimitrov, 2003 ). Maximal rates of force development (MRFD) and relaxation (MRFR) and the mechanical latency between FNMS and the beginning of the quadriceps mechanical response were calculated from Tw p to provide insight s for twitch morphology. Maximal voluntary activation (VA) during MVC was Db 100)] \u00d7100 A correction was applied to the original equation when the superimposed stimulation was administrated before or afte r the maximal MVC force (Strojnik and Komi, 1998 ). The same equatio n was used in order to assess voluntary activation at submaximal force level (Fig. 2). The root mean squared calculated from vastus lateralis RMS/M ) was also calculated as another index of central a ctivation (Millet et al., 2012b ). The following parameters were calculated from submaximal contractions: total number of contractions ( i.e. endurance index) and force - time integral. Statistical analysis All variables are reported as mea n \u00b1 standard deviation. Normal distribution and homogeneity of variance analysis were confirmed using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov and Skewness test, respectively. Unpaired t -tests were conducted to compare patients and controls for the following variables: subj ects characteristics, questionnaires scores and neuromuscular function at Pre. To compare changes in variables during the QIF test and differences between groups, we used two -way repeated measures ANOVAs (time \u00d7 group) and t Bonferroni correctio n for post-hoc analysis. Pearson's correlations were used to determine relationship between variables. To assess reliability of neuromuscular measurements, we calculated change in the mean values of both sessions with 95% confidence interval and used paire d t-test for detection of systematic bias (Atkinson and PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 150 Nevill, 1998 ). Due to our sample size, we used typical error expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV TE) to study absolute reliability (Hopkins, 20 00). Relative reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence intervals of variation (Hopkins, 2002 ). ICCs were not calculated for VA due to the ceiling effect associated with these measurements (Clark et al., 2007 ; Place et al., 2007 ). The alpha level was set at 0.05 for all tests. All other statistica l analyses were performed with a statistical software package (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah USA). RESULTS Functional capacities and questionnaires Data from maximal incremental cycling test are shown in Table 1. During the maximal incremental cycling test, FSHD and CMT patients had lower maximal workload and VO 2,peak than controls. Maximal heart rate as a percentage of maximal theoretical value and blood lactate concentration were significantly lower in FSHD patients only compared to controls. 6 -min walking dista nce was also reduced in patients. Scores of FSS and SF -36 questionnaires are shown in Table 2. Eleven FSHD patients and five CMT patients reported significant experienced fatigue ( i.e. >36, (Amato et supramaximality data for FSHD patients and all controls are shown in Figure 1. FNMS was well -tolerated and no adverse effects were reported. In two FSHD patients, we were unable to obtain M -wave or mechanical responses. FNMS supramaximality was not confirmed in four other FSHD patients where Tw u amplitude differed by more than 10% (i.e. twice the Tw u coefficient of variation (Bachasson et al., 2012a )) between 100 and 80% maximal stimulator power output. These six patients were excluded from further analysis involving FNMS responses. In all other FSHD patients and controls, supramaximal stimulation was achieved and therefore, FNMS data were analyzed in thirteen patients compared to thirteen patient -control pairs. In CMT patients, no reproducible or supramaximal M -wave and mechanical responses could be obtained. Consequently, FNMS PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 151 data of CMT patients during the quadriceps test were not analyzed and only mechanical and EMG data during voluntary maneuvers were compared between the e ight CMT patients and eight patient -control pairs. Quadriceps assessments at baseline Quadriceps neuromuscular characteristics at baseline in FSHD patients and controls are shown in Table 3. Volitional and evoked strength, both as absolute values and nor malized to estimated quadriceps volume, were significantly lower in FSHD patients compared to controls. Higher Tw p MRFD and MRFR were observed in controls compared to FSHD patients but these differences disappeared when normalized to the Tw p amplitude (normalized MRFD, P=0.56; normalized MRFR, P=0.22). FSHD 10:100 than controls. M -wave amplitude and area were similar in patients compared to controls. No differences in M -wave and mechanical latencies were found between F SHD patients and controls. Concerning central parameters, FSHD patients had significantly higher VA and similar MVC RMS/M compared to controls. The strength - activation relationship also indicated a tendency for greater VA at 20, 40, 60 and 80 % of MVC in FS HD patients compared to controls (P=0.06; Fig. 2.). In FSHD patients, significant correlations were found between MVC (in Nm) and VA (r= -0.41; P<0.05). Also, MVC per kg of body weight with 6 -min walking distance (r=0.77; P<0.001), kg of body weight (r=0.58; P<0.01). In CMT patients, volitional and evoked strength, both as absolute values and normalized to estimated quadriceps volume, were significantly lower compared to controls (see Table 5). MVC per kg of body weight correlated with VO 2,peak per kg of body weight (r=0.71; P<0.05). Quadriceps endurance and fatigue During the QIF t est, the total number of submaximal contractions tended to be smaller in patients compared to controls (FSHD 55 \u00b18 versus 60\u00b19, respectively, P =0.06; CMT 53\u00b16 versus 58\u00b19, P=0.13 ). Compared to controls, the ratio the last submaximal contraction PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 152 and the f irst following MVC at Exh was significantly lower in FSHD patients (0.89 \u00b10.06 versus 0.96\u00b10.11; P<0.05) and \u00b10.11 versus 0.90\u00b10.07; P=0.64) Changes in MVC in FSHD patients and controls are shown in Figure 3. Changes in Tw p, Db100, Db10:100 and VA are shown in Figure 4. No significant differences were found between groups for these variables (all P>0.05). No significant changes over time or between groups were found for M -wave amplitude, area, latency and for mechanical latency (all P>0.05, data not shown). Change in MVC during the quadriceps fatigue test in CMT patients and controls are shown in Figure 3. No significant difference between groups was observed (P=0.18). Reliability of quadriceps neuromuscular assessments in pa tients Endurance and muscular work. Mean number of submaximal contractions was similar in test and re -test sessions for FSHD (54\u00b15 versus 56\u00b16; P=0.17) -0.95) in FSHD patients. In was 4.5% and ICC 0.87 (95% CI: 0.60 -0.97). Total force -time product was in FSHD patients (10178\u00b14752 versus 10595\u00b14660 Nm P=0.60). Neuromuscular assessments. Among the twelve FSHD patients performed a test -retest, 2 had unsatisfactory FNMS supramaximality and were excluded from analysis involving evoked mu scle responses. The reliability of volitional and evoked quadriceps strength at baseline and set 50% are shown in Table 4. No significant differences were observed between test and re -test sessions for any parameters. Serum creatine kinase in FSHD patients did not significantly increase 24 hours after the quadriceps test (284 \u00b1136 versus 326\u00b1140 IU l-1; P=0.48) . The reliability of volitional strength at baseline and set 50% in CMT patients are shown in Table 6. No significant differences were observed between test and re -test. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 153 DISCUSSION Our results showed that our test involving incremental isome tric intermittent loading and FNMS appeared to be safe, feasible and reliable to assess quadriceps strength, fatigue and endurance in patients with FSHD. Supramaximal FNMS was however not achievable in ~30% of FSHD patients. Valid quadriceps mechanical res ponses evoked by FNMS could not be obtained in CMT patients but fatigue and endurance assessments using volitional manoeuvers appeared to be reliable. Contrary to our hypothesis, we report similar peripheral and central fatigability in patients compared to controls. Quadriceps weakness but not fatigability correlated with functional capacities in both groups of patients and correlated with perceived fatigue. Feasibility and reliability of the QIF test and FNMS in patients FNMS supramaximality. Supramaximal stimulation was obtained in 68% of FSHD patients and 100% of controls. In two male FSHD patients, we were unable to obtain a distinguishable M -wave or evoked response. One of these patients had the second highest percentage body fat amongst patients (34%) and the other had 24% body fat. Among the four patients (one women and three men) with unsatisfactory supramaximality (see Fig. 1), mean body fat percentage was 31 \u00b12%. As a result, increased distance between the FNMS coil and the femoral nerve caused by fa t interposition leads to a reduced stimulation intensity as previously reported by our team (Tomazin et al., 2011 ) and may explain, in part, the inability t o reach supramaximal FNMS in these patients. We were unable to obtain supramaximal stimulation in any patient, even those with low body fat percentage. One potential explanation is that the stimulation intensity required to effectively stimulate the nerve of CMT patients has been previously shown to be much greater than that the intensity required in healthy nerves (Meulstee et al., 1997 ; Nodera et al., 2004 ) but further researches are needed to clarify the mechanisms involved. In addition, utilization of femoral electrical stimulation might also studied as an alternative pending enhancement of magnetic st imulation devices (Verges et al., 2009 ). Feasibility and reliability. Our fatiguing protocol (Bachasson et al., 2012b ) appeared to be safe since serum creatine kinase concentrations before and 24 hours after the test did not change significantly in FSHD patients and since evoked and volitional strengths were PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 154 similar between test and re -test sessions. FNMS was well -tolerated in patients as previously reported in other pathological conditions (e.g. in COPD (Polkey et al., 1996a ), chronic heart failure (Hopkinson et al., 2012 ), fibromyalgia syndrome (Bachasson et al., 2012b )). Reliability of MVC and evoked muscular responses at baseline were satisfactory (CV TE<7% and ICC>0.82). MVC and Tw p reliability was similar to the between -day reliability previously observed in COPD patients (Saey et al., 2003 ). Percentage reductions in MVC and evoked muscular responses during the QIF test appeared to be very similar between the test and re -test sessions. At s et 50%, CV TE were <10% and ICC were >0.85 for both MVC and evoked muscular responses. For VA, CV TE was <5% at baseline and at set 50% but relative reliability was lower as shown by large limits of agreement at baseline, influenced by one outlier that showe d a large VA reduction in the second session (-21%). These results are in accordance with previous results showing relatively large VA variability in healthy subjects (Morton et al., 2005 ; Place et al., 2007 ) and in patients with neuromuscular disorders (Horemans et al., 2004 ). MVC RMS/M was less reliable than VA as previously observed (Place et al., 2007 ). Muscle endurance assessed with the total number of submaximal contraction was reliable (CV TE<5% and ICC>0.95). To gether, these results indicate that the reliability of neuromuscular assessments in FSHD patients is good and suitable for follow -up or interventional studies. MVC measurements before (Solari et al., 2008 ) and during the QIF test are suitable to evaluate strength and fatigability in patients with CMT. Quadriceps properties at baseline in patients versus controls Voluntary strength and evoked responses. As expec ted, FSHD patients had lower MVC and evoked muscular responses compared to controls ( -45%). When normalized to estimated quadriceps volume, MVC and evoked muscular responses remained lower in patients. This result may reflect fibrosis and lipid infiltratio n usually observed in dystrophic muscle (Friedman et al., 2012 ). Also, changes in myocytes ultrastructure ( e.g. atrophic myotubes) and the loss of tendon -fiber continuity during muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration (Goldstein and McNally, 2010 ) may contribute to the impaired strength -volume relationship in FSHD patients. More accurate measurements of muscle volume and structure with magnetic resonance imaging (Kan et al., 2009 ) are needed to confirm that strength production per unit of muscle volume is reduced in FSHD patients. Lower Db 10:100 may indicate that the force relationship in dystroph ic PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 155 muscle is influenced by factors such as macroscopic and microscopic muscle abnormalities mentioned above (Barro et al., 2010 ; Goldstein and McNally, 2010 ; Friedman et al., 2012 ). Conversely, similar M -wave characteristics indicate that nerve conduction and action potential propagation are preserved in FSHD patients. In CMT patients, MVC was significantly reduced compared to matched controls ( -37%) in line with previous reports (Schillings et al., 2007 ). In CMT, proximal leg compartments usually display less atrophy and fatty infiltration than distal compartments (Gallardo et al., 2006 ). Estimated quadric eps volume was not significantly reduced in CMT patients and therefore MVC normalized to estimated quadriceps volume was lower compared to controls. As discussed above, accurate measurements of muscle volume are needed and, in the absence of VA measurement s, we are unable to discriminate between central and peripheral factors responsible for this weakness. Central parameters. One unexpected result was the higher VA at baseline in FSHD patients compared to controls. In both groups, mean VA was >90% which is within the range usually observed in healthy human quadriceps (Place et al., 2007 ; O'Brien et al., 2008 ). A tendency for higher activation level at submaximal fraction of MVC was also found in FSHD patients (see Fig. 2). However, our results did not show lower voluntary activation assessed MVC RMS/M (see Table 3) and this could be explained, in part, by larg er inter individual variability of MVC RMS/M previously observed (Place et al., 2007 ). Lower VA in FSHD patients contrasts with the previous work of Schillings et al. (2007 ) reporting large activation failure in biceps brachii of FSHD patients. This discrepancy between our results might be partly explained by different stimulation procedures used in this work (e. g. direct muscle electrical stimulation and use of stimulation train) and the muscle group studied . On the other hand, normal activation has also been reported in other neuromuscular disease such as post -polio syndrome (Allen et al ., 1997 ). Shillings et al (2007 ) purposed that lower voluntary activation in patients might reflect of protective mechanism to prevent muscle from furth er damage. Previous findings however showed that cortico -cortical inhibition assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation might be reduced in FSHD and may reflect a compensatory phenomenon of the central nervous system to overcome peripheral muscle weak ness (Di Lazzaro et al., 2004 ). These data might support higher VA observed in FSHD observed in the present work but the relation between central inhibitio n/excitability and the level of activation assessed at the peripheral level is still to be clarified (Gruet et al., 2013 ). VA might also be enhanced in patients due PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 156 to overuse (Vivodtzev et al., 2008 ). In addition, we showed that quadriceps weakness was moderately corr elated with VA and this might also support this latest hypothesis. Quadriceps fatigability and endurance in patients versus controls MVC, peripheral fatigability and endurance . Our results showed similar reductions in MVC and evoked muscular responses in F SHD patients and controls during a standardized fatigue protocol at identical relative intensities ( i.e. identical % of MVC). Reductions in Db10:100 were also similar indicating that the amount of low -frequency fatigue was comparable in both groups. M -wave characteristics did not change during the test meaning that impairment of action potential propagation is not involved in the fatigue induced by this protocol in either FSHD patients or controls. These results contrast with the study of Schillings et al. (2007 ), which reported smaller reduction in MVC and evoked muscular responses in patients after a 2 -min sustained MVC compared to controls. In this study, central activation in patients was greatly impaired and therefore lower muscle recruitment may have induced less fatigue. Our results also contrast with the work of Schulte -Mattler et al. (2003 ), who showed increased contractile fatigue in dorsiflexors induced by intermittent electrical neurostimulation in FSHD patients. However, these results are difficult to compare with the present study because th e group of patients studied was particularly heterogeneous involving various neurogenic and myopathic diseases ( e.g. only four patients with FSHD). FSHD patients showed a tendency to have reduced muscle endurance (P=0.06) as measured by the total number of submaximal contractions. Turki et al. (2012 ) recently repor ted increased oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function in fifteen patients with FSHD compared to a group of healthy controls. The authors reported that both quadriceps volitional strength and endurance ( i.e. time to exhaustion during dynamic co ntractions at 30% of MVC) correlate with these abnormalities. Although quadriceps endurance was much shorter in FSHD, time to exhaustion was highly variable in both groups (384\u00b1353 s in patients versus 603\u00b1357 s in controls). Furthermore, the amount of fat igue induced was not measured. Since peripheral fatigue kinetics were similar in FSHD patients and controls in the present study, the tendency to lower endurance may be explained, in part, by the significantly lower ratio of the last submaximal contraction and the first following MVC at exhaustion in patients, indicating slightly submaximal effort. Lack of motivation, fear of pain and muscle damage frequently observed in patients may also contribute to earlier task -failure in patients. The discrepancy betwe en our results PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 157 and Turki et al. (2012 ) might partly relayed upon the type of contraction since dystrophic muscle might be more sensitive to muscle damage than healthy muscle during dynamic contractions (Dellorusso et al., 2001 ). In CMT patients, our result showed similar reduction in MVC during the QIF test and non -significant difference in terms of endurance. In previous studies exploring quadriceps, similar observations have been made (Lindeman et al., 1999 ; Schillings et al., 2007 ; Menotti et al., 2012 ) but these results are difficult to compare because mostly sustained MVCs were used rather than intermittent sub -maximal contractions as in the present work. As discussed above, measurements of fatigue using maximal force alone does not discriminate betwee n peripheral and central factors so that we cannot distinguish peripheral and central ( i.e. spinal and supraspinal but also at the peripheral nerve trunk level) factors responsible for MVC reduction in CMT patients. We recently showed that MVC are not able to detect small differences in muscle fatigue between patients and controls and that evoked responses are more sensitive (Bachasson et al., 2012b ). At last, we cannot exclude lack of statistical power to detect differences between CMT and controls. Central fatigability. Since no significant differences were observed in VA duri ng the quadriceps fatigue test, central fatigue appeared to be similar in FSHD patients and controls in accordance with previous work of Schillings et al. (2007 ). Thus, central activation impairments during a fatiguing task (sustained or intermittent) do not seem to be a limiting factor in FSHD patients. As previously mentioned, we cannot state on the central fatigability in CMT patients without VA assessme nts. Relation between quadriceps function, functional capacities and subjective fatigue in patients Impaired exercise capacity during stationary cycling (in all patients) and 6 -min walking distance (in FSHD patients only) appeared to be related to quadric eps weakness rather than muscle endurance or fatigue in line with previous findings (Alfano et al., 2012 ). This weakness also seemed to impact negatively on physical functioning (SF -36 subscore) and perceived fatigue (FSS score) in FSHD patients. In the present study, FSHD patients and controls performed the quadriceps fatigue test at the same relative intensity ( i.e. at the same % of MVC), patients probably have to work at a higher percentage of MVC compared to healthy subjects due to significant muscle weakness during spontaneous activity. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE III 158 Therefore, they may develop larger amounts of fatigue in their daily lives. This may explain, in part, why neither central nor peripheral fatigue as assessed in the present study (i.e. for the same relative workload) were related to impaired functional capacities, physical functionin g or subjective fatigue in FSHD patients. CONCLUSIONS We showed that FNMS is feasible and reliable in ~70% of FSHD patients to assess central and peripheral neuromuscular function at rest and during an isolated quadriceps fatiguing task. We reported signi ficant muscle weakness and similar peripheral and central fatigability during intermittent isometric contractions at identical relative force level in FSHD patients compared to controls. In CMT patients, FNMS showed a lack of power to achieve optimal stimu lation. Meanwhile, the quadriceps fatiguing protocol appeared to be safe and reliable to assess global fatigue and endurance in this population. Impairment of functional and subjective physical capacities and experienced fatigue in patients seems to be rel ated to muscle weakness rather than enhanced muscle fatigability or reduced endurance. Further studies must be conducted to assess neuromuscular fatigue induced by functional exercise not relative to maximal voluntary strength in order to clarify the impac t of neuromuscular fatigue in patient's daily life activities. Additional studies must be conducted to assess the feasibility of femoral electrical nerve stimulation as an alternative especially in neurogenic patients and pending enhancement of magnetic st imulation devices.

Damien BACHASSON PT M.Sca,b,, Michel Universit\u00e9 Lyon, 4 76 76 assess quadriceps strength and fatigabil ity by using femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) and its relationship with exercise capacity in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) and healthy controls. Methods: 22 women (11 FMS , 11 controls) performed a maximal incremental cycling test and a quadriceps fatigue test on two separated visits. For quadriceps assessment, we used FNMS during and after maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) to evaluate central and peripheral factors of neuromuscular fatigue. Subjects performed sets of 10 intermittent ( 5-s on/5-s off) isometric contractions starting at 10% MVC, with 10% MVC increment from one set to another until exhaustion. Neuromuscular fatigue was assessed with FNMS after each set. Results: FMS had reduced initial MVC to controls (102 \u00b118 versus 120\u00b124 Nm, respectively; P<0.05) without significant impairment versus 93.1\u00b13.4%; P>0.05). During the fatiguing task, FMS exhibited greater fall in evoked muscular responses but not in MVC ( e.g. -24\u00b17% versus -19\u00b14% at set 50% MVC; . During the cycling test, FMS had lowered maximal exercise capacity and enhanced rate of perceived exertion (RPE) compared to controls. Percentage reduction in evoked muscular responses during the quadriceps fatigue test correlated wit h maximal oxygen consumption (r=0.56; P<0.05) and RPE at submaximal intensity (r=0.84; P<0.05) during cycling. Conclusion: Larger impairment in muscle contractility is associated with enhanced perception of exertion and reduced maximal exercise capacity in FMS patients. Neuromuscular impairments should be considered as an important factor underlying functional limitations in FMS patients. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 177 SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION Reduced quadriceps strength in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome is not associated with v oluntary activation deficit but most probably to smaller muscle mass. During repeated isometric quadriceps contractions, patients with fibromyalgia syndrome exhibit larger contractility impairment as assessed with magnetic neurostimulation. Larger impairm ent in muscle contractility may be involved in enhanced perceived exertion and reduced maximal exercise capacity in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST None PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 178 INTRODUCTION Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) is a multifactorial chronic disorder combining multi -focal pain and fatigue, sleep disturbances and various other symptoms (1). Fear of pain and kinesiophobia (2) contribute to decreased physical activity (3, 4) and reduced exercise capacity (5-7). Physica l fitness in FMS has mostly been characterized by reduced maximal performance and increased perceived exertion during exercise such as stationary cycling (6-8). In addition to alteration in sensory perception, reduced muscle strength and increased fatigabi lity may contribute to exercise limitation and promote hyperalgesia (9, 10). Impairment of locomotor muscles has been identified as a relevant contributing factor to reduced exercise capacity and disability in numerous chronic diseases such as rheumatoid conditions (11), cardiovascular diseases (12) and respiratory disorders (13). In FMS patients, quadriceps weakness has been repeatedly reported (7, 14, 15) while impaired endurance and higher fatigability compared to controls have also been suggested (14, 1 6, 17). However, the relative contribution of motivation, pain and deconditioning in neuromuscular impairment remains unclear. Moreover, the role of muscle performance (e.g. strength and fatigability) impairments regarding exercise capacity in FMS patients remains to be determined. Neuromuscular function can be assessed with artificial muscle stimulation. It allows distinguishing peripheral ( e.g. action potential propagation, excitation -contraction failure, contractility) and central (activation failure due to pain and spinal or supraspinal mechanisms) factors responsible for attenuated strength and fatigue (18). To our knowledge, only two studies (19, 20) evaluated quadriceps function in FMS by using transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation. Both report ed reduced maximal voluntary strength in FMS patients but a reduction in maximal voluntary activation (VA) was reported by Jacobsen et al. (19) only. N\u00f8rregaard et al. (20) explored peripheral fatigability during intermittent contractions and reported no d ifference between FMS patients and controls. Both studies are questionable regarding the methodology used, involving submaximal muscle rather that supramaximal nerve stimulation and leading to abnormally low VA in controls ( e.g. ~ 80% (20)). PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 179 The purpose o f the present study was to investigate quadriceps strength and fatigability and its relationship with exercise capacity in FMS patients. To assess neuromuscular function, we used femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) recently validated by our team (21) and more suitable for clinical practice than standard electrical neurostimulation (22, 23) . To assess endurance and fatigue, we used an isolated muscle exercise test involving intermittent isometric contractions at increasing force levels with iterative m easurements of fatigue in order to limit the confounding effects of pain and motivation. We hypothesized that FMS patients would have reduced maximal strength and increased muscle fatigability, due to both peripheral and central mechanisms. We also hypothe sized that these neuromuscular impairments would be associated, at least in part, with reduced exercise capacity and increased sensations of fatigue during stationary cycling. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 180 METHODS Subjects Twenty -two women (11 FMS and 11 healthy controls) volunteere d to participate in this study and gave written informed consent. Their main characteristics are presented in Table 1. At screening, all patients underwent physical examination by a rheumatologist and met the American college criteria for FMS (24). Patients were excluded if they presented contraindications to magnetic stimulation, pathological knee condition, femoral nerve compression history, disorders of thyroid gland and current psychiatric cond ition. We included normal weight FMS patients (BMI<25) to avoid the confounding effect of body mass excess and to guarantee supramaximal FNMS (25). Seven patients took analgesics for pain (five took 1st-2nd and two 3rd class). Three took specific serotonin ergic reuptake inhibitors, three benzodiazepines and four 1st class antidepressants for sleep disorders. Healthy sedentary (<3 hours of physical activity per week) controls were paired to FMS patients for age and BMI. The study was conducted according to t he Declaration of Helsinki with approval from the local Committee on Human Research ( Comit\u00e9 de protection des personnes Sud -EST V ). Experimental design During the first visit, after answering questionnaires, subjects performed a maximal incremental exercis e test on a cycle ergometer. During the second session, subjects performed quadriceps neuromuscular assessment. Anthropometric measurements Body fat mass percentage was assessed from four skinfolds (26). Quadriceps volume estimation was based on a trunca ted cone calculation using three thigh perimeters and thigh skinfold (27). PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 181 Questionnaires Habitual physical activity was evaluated with the Ricci -Gagnon French questionnair e (28). We used the Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) to assess the status o f FMS patients (29). Pain was assessed with a 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS) during the last week and the last 24 hours. The influence of FMS on quality of life was evaluated with the Medical Outcomes Study Short -Form (SF -36) (30). Catastrophizing was as sessed with the pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) (31). Maximal cycling test Subjects performed a maximal incremental exercise test on a computer -controlled electrically braked cycle ergometer (Ergometrics 800, Ergoline, Bitz, expired gas ana lysis and electrocardiogram (Medisoft, Dinant, Belgium) (32). Stationary cycling was used because i) it is the most frequently used exercise modality in FMS (5-8) and ii) it strongly involves quadriceps muscle which is a major locomotor muscle easily asses sed with FNMS. Based on usual recommendations ( i.e. initial power and increments chosen to obtain an exercise duration ranging from 8 to 12 min (33)), exercise protocols were defined as follow: 15 W initial power in FMS patients and 30 W in controls for 2 min followed by 2 -min increments (15 W in FMS and 25 W in controls). Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed each minute all along the test with a standard 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS). A fingertip blood sample was obtained 3 min after exhaustion and analyzed for lactate concentration (NOVA+, Nova Biomedical Corporation, Waltham MA, USA). Quadriceps neuromuscular assessment Experimental setup All measurements were conducted on the right lower limb under isometric condition. Subject lay supine o n a customized quadriceps chair. The knee was flexed at 90\u00b0 and the hip angle was 130\u00b0 for proper access to the femoral triangle during FNMS. Voluntary PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 182 strength and evoked responses to FNMS were measured with an inextensible ankle strap connected to a stra in gauge (SBB 200kg Tempo Technologies, Taipei, Taiwan). Compensatory movement of the upper body was limited by two belts across thorax and abdomen. Subjects were asked to keep their hands on their abdomen. A visual feedback of both the force produced and the target force levels (see below) was provided to the subjects. Femoral Nerve Magnetic Stimulation (FNMS) FNMS was performed with a 45 -mm figure -eight coil powered by two Magstim 200 stimulators (peak magnetic eld 2.5 T, stimulation duration 0.1 ms; Magstim, Whitland, United Kingdom) linked with a Bistim Module (Magstim), as previously described (21). Single (twitch) and paired stimulations (10 Hz and 100 Hz doublets) were performed at maximum stimulator output. The coil was positioned high in the femoral triangle in regard to the femoral nerve. Optimal stimulation site allowing maximal unpotentiated quadricep s strength u) and maximum vastus lateralis M-wave amplitude (M ampl) was determined. After 20 min of rest, stimulation supramaximality was carefully checked with decreasing stimulator power output (100%, 95%, 90%, 85% and 80%). Tw u and M ampl were no t significantly reduced until 80% of the maximal power output in both groups, confirming FNMS supramaximality as previously reported in our laboratory (21) . Quadriceps surface EMG signal was recorded from the vastus lateralis (as a surrogate for whole qu adriceps (34)) as described in detail previously (21). EMG signals were amplied (BioAmp, AD instruments, Medford, USA ,) with a bandwidth from 5 to 500 Hz. EMG data together with force signals were digitized online at a sampling frequency of 2,000 Hz and recorded on a dedicated device (PowerLab, ADInstrument s). Quadriceps fatigue test description Before starting the initial neuromuscular assessment, subjects performed ten 5 -s submaximal isometric quadriceps contractions in order to warm up the quadriceps muscle and to familiarize themselves with the visual feedback and the soundtrack instructions (see below). Then, subjects performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with 1 min PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 183 of rest between each MVC (34). Following these MVCs allowing full muscle potentiation (35), the initial neuromuscular asses sment (Pre) was performed. It included a 5 -s MVC superimposed with a 100 Hz doublet (Db 100,s) and followed after 2 s ( i.e. on relaxed muscle) by two potentiated doublets at 100 Hz (Db 100) and 10 Hz (Db 10) performed 4 s apart. After 15 seconds of rest, the subject performed a second MVC followed after 2 s by one potentiated twitch (Tw p). During all MVCs, subjects were vigorously encouraged by the experimenter. Evoked high and low frequency paired stimulations provide an extensive understanding of peripheral fatigue ( e.g. high and low frequency peripheral fatigue) (21) and high frequency superimposed stimulation provides optimal resolution for central activation assessment (34). After Pre assessment, sets of 10 intermittent (5 -s on / 5 -s off) contractions at s ubmaximal target forces were performed, starting at 10% MVC for the first set, 20% MVC for the second set and so on until task failure. Subjects had a visual force feedback providing the target level and listened to a soundtrack indicating the contraction -relaxation rhythm. Task failure was defined as two consecutive contractions 10 N below the target force for more than 2.5 s. Five seconds after the end of each 10 -contraction set and at exhaustion (Exh), neuromuscular assessments similar to Pre assessment were performed. Data Analysis From the maximal incremental cycling test, we assessed maximal work load, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2,max), minute ventilation (VE), heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and RPE. We also assessed submaximal r esponses for the same variables at 50 and 75% of both measured and predicted VO 2,max (36) in order to account for the potential submaximality of maximal cycling test in FMS patients as previously reported (6). One FMS patient was excluded from this analysi s because she did not reach 75% of predicted VO 2,max. The following parameters were calculated from the mechanical responses to FNMS during quadriceps neuromuscular assessment: peak force for Tw u, Tw p, Tw s, Db 100, Db 100,s and the ratio Db 10 over 100 (Db 10:100). M ampl was calculated from potentiated single stimulation. For MVCs, we considered the maximal value of the two trials performed at Pre, after each PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 184 sub-maximal contraction set and at Exh. Maximal voluntary activation (VA) was calculated from the sup erimposed and potentiated 100 Hz 100)] \u00d7100 A correction was applied to the original equation when the superimposed stimulation was administrated slightly before or after the real peak MVC (34). We analyzed data fr om the 10 -contraction sets at 10% to 50% MVC (set 10%, set 20%, set 30%, set 40%, set 50%) because they were completed by all subjects. Changes in maximal voluntary and evoked quadriceps responses from Pre to set 50% were used as indexes of fatigability. Statistical Analysis All variables are reported as mean \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) within text and tables. Normal distribution and homogeneity of variances analysis were confirmed using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov and Skewness test, respectively. Unpaired t -tests were conducted to compare FMS patients and controls for the following variables: subject characteristics, questionnaire scores and neuromuscular function at Pre. To compare changes in variables during the quadriceps fatigue test, we used two -way repeated measures ANOVAs (time x group) and t -tests with Bonferroni's correction for post -hoc analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to determine relationship between variables ( i.e. between quadriceps neuromuscular function, cycling exercise responses and questionnaires). The alpha level was set at 0.05 for all tests. Statistical analysis was performed with a statistical software package (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah USA). PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 185 RESULTS Questionnaires Questionnaires scores are shown in Table 1. FMS patients had mode rate to severe FMS as indicated by the FIQ score and VAS pain. They showed higher fatigue perception than controls and moderate pain catastrophizing score. Reported physical activity was not significantly different between FMS patients and controls. FMS patients had altered quality of life in both physical and psychological domains. Quadriceps neuromuscular assessment FMS patients had lower MVC but similar VA compared to controls (Table 2). Tw p and Db100 were also significantly lower in FMS patients. Estim ated quadriceps volume was significantly reduced in FMS patients and, consequently, both voluntary and evoked strength normalized to volume were not different between groups. During the quadriceps fatigue test, the total number of submaximal contractions was not significantly different between groups (54 \u00b1 8 versus 58 \u00b1 8 for FMS patients and controls, respectively; P > 0.05 ). MVC decline did not significantly differ between groups (at set 50% , -24 \u00b1 7% in versus -21 \u00b1 5% in controls; F = 1.52 and P = 0.12). Changes in Tw p, Db 100 and VA during the quadriceps fatigue test are shown in Figure 1. Reductions in Tw p and Db 100 were significantly greater in FMS patients. The reduction in D b10:100 did not differ between groups (data not shown, P > 0.05). The drop in VA showed a tendency to be larger in FMS patients (interaction: F = 2.06, P = 0.06). No significant change was found for M -wave characteristics over time in both groups (P > 0.05, data not shown). Maximal cycling test Total mean duration was 12 \u00b1 1 min for FMS and 11 \u00b1 2 min for controls (P > 0.05). FMS patients had lower maximum workload than controls (90 \u00b1 15 W versus 153 \u00b1 40 W; P < 0.05). Similarly, VO 2,max was lower in FMS patients (Table 3). The percentage of maximal PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 186 theoretical HR reached at exhaustion was lower in FMS patients compared to controls (86 \u00b1 11 % versus 100 \u00b1 7 %; P < 0.05). RER (Table 3) and blood lactate concentration (5.3 \u00b1 2.0 versus 8.6 \u00b1 1.7 mmol.l-1; P < 0.05) at exhaustion were also lower in FMS patients compared to controls. HR, RPE, RER and VE as a function of VO 2 are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3. The slopes of HR -VO 2 (4.4 \u00b1 1.1 versus 3.1 \u00b1 0.9 bpm/ml.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.05) and RPE -VO 2 (0.57 \u00b1 0.22 versus 0.35 \u00b1 0.11 points/ml.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.05) linear regressions were significantly larger in FMS patients compared to controls. VO 2,max correlated with the percentage reduction in Tw p (Fig. 3A) and Db 100 (r = 0.34; P < 0.05) at set 50% during the quadr iceps fatigue test. The RPE at 75% of predicted VO 2,max correlated with the percentage reduction in Tw p (Fig. 3B) and Db 100 (r = 0.66; P < 0.05) at set 50%. VO 2,max correlated with self -reported physical activity (r = 0.51; P < 0.05). No other correlation was found between questionnaire scores and exercise capacity or quadriceps strength and fatigability (all P > 0.05). PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 187 DISCUSSION The present study aimed at evaluating quadriceps function ( i.e. strength and fatigability) and its relationship with exercise capacity in a group of FMS patients and healthy controls. Our results showed that FMS patients have i) reduced volitional and evoked quadriceps strength without significant impairment of voluntary activation and ii) greater percentage reduction in evoked strength and similar falls in maximal voluntary strength and activation during an isolated quadriceps exercise. Also, FMS showed reduced maximal exercise capacity and increased RPE during cycling which correlate with the amount of evoked quadriceps strengt h reduction during the quadriceps fatigue test. Therefore, these results suggest that peripheral neuromuscular fatigue might contribute to exercise limitations in FMS patients. Quadriceps neuromuscular assessment The reduced quadriceps strength observed at Pre in FMS patients emphasizes previous findings regarding muscle weakness in FMS (7, 15, 16) . Our results provide important insights on potential underlying mechanisms. First, reduced strength in FMS patients is not due to impaired muscle activation sinc e VA was similar between both groups and comparable to values previously reported in healthy subjects (34). These results do not confirm previous results suggesting reduced quadriceps voluntary activation in FMS patients assessed with transcutaneous electr ical stimulation (19, 20) . The use of less painful (22, 26) and supramaximal FNMS in the present study (rather than submaximal electrical muscle stimulation in previous studies) can probably explain this difference. Secondly, when reported to estimated qua driceps volume, quadriceps strength did not differ anymore between groups. Hence, the reduced quadriceps strength observed in FMS patients appears to be mainly explained by slightly smaller muscle mass rather than by activation deficiency or altered contra ctility. This result needs to be confirmed with more accurate measurements of muscle mass, such as magnetic resonance imaging. During the quadriceps fatigue test, FMS showed greater decline in evoked muscular responses (Tw p and Db 100) but no significant di fference (P = 0.12) in MVC decline compared to controls. Larger exercise -induced reduction in Tw p compared to MVC has been repeatedly described (37-39). Evoked muscular responses have been reported to be PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 188 more sensitive than MVC to detect inter -individual d ifferences (40) and drug (13) or hypoxia (41) effects when measuring muscle fatigue. A potential explanation for greater alterations of evoked muscular responses but not MVC in FMS patients is that Tw p is affected by excitation -contraction coupling failure , which is partly overcome by high - frequency alpha motoneurons discharge rate during MVC. In the present study, similar changes in Db 10:100 in both groups indicate that FMS patients did not show more low - frequency muscle fatigue. In addition, no difference s in M -wave characteristics were found so that impairments of nerve potential propagation are not involved. Thereby, an alternative explanation is that some alterations may occur at the actin -myosin cross -bridge level at low but not high -force level in FMS patients . Muscle structural abnormalities (42, 43), alterations of phosphorylation and oxidative capacities (44) and neuroendocrine disorders (45) might be potential mechanism to explain impaired muscle contractility in FMS patients during the quadriceps fatigue test. At last, the number of submaximal contractions was not different between groups suggesting that task failure during the quadriceps fatigue test may depend on other factors than peripheral contractile fatigue as discussed elsewhere (46). The p resent results are not in accordance with the results of N\u00f8rregaard et al. (20) showing similar reductions of evoked muscular responses during intermittent isometric quadriceps contraction at 50% MVC in FMS patients and controls. The use of submaximal elec trical muscle stimulation rather than supramaximal nerve stimulation and insufficient muscle potentiation in N\u00f8rregaard et al. (20) may explain these results . Other studies on quadriceps fati gability in FMS patients are difficult to interpret since they used volitional force measurements only (14, 45, 47) . Our results also show normal muscle activation in FMS patients during intermittent quadriceps contractions, as previously observed for elb ow flexors (48). However, the tendency for larger VA reduction in FMS patients cannot entirely rule out a role of activation deficit. Isolated isometric contractions of the quadriceps may induce less pain and, as a consequence, less central inhibition comp ared to multi -joint dynamic movements able to induce pain in other structures than muscles ( e.g. skin, joints, enthesis...). Hence, central limitations may be task dependent (18) and further studies regarding this aspect in FMS are required (49). PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 189 Maximal cy cling test Our results showed that VO 2,max and maximum workload are reduced in FMS patients as previously reported (5, 6) . We also showed that FMS patients achieve submaximal effort as shown by the lower percentage of maximal theoretical HR and the lower RER and blood lactate concentration at exhaustion. Submaximality of exercise testing in FMS patients has been reported in previous studies (6, 8) . This submaximality is in contrast with normal VA during the quadriceps fatigue test. Larger afferent input du ring cycling (due to larger muscle mass recruitment and cardio -respiratory stimulation) might explain a greater involvement of central mechanisms compared to isolated quadriceps isometric contractions as discussed above. From the current literature, it is unclear whether the physiological exercise response at submaximal intensities in FMS patients is impaired (7, 8) . In the present study, FMS patients had significantly lower HR and VE at 50% and 75% of measured VO 2,max compared to controls. However, reduced VO 2,max and the issue of submaximality as discussed above may explain these results and comparisons of physiological responses at percentages of measured VO 2,max may lead to erroneous conclusions. Thus, we expressed submaximal physiological responses as a percentage of predicted VO 2,max, i.e. the individual theoretical maximal exercise performance for age and body mass (36). In this case, HR and VE at 50% and 75% of predicted VO 2,max were no longer different between FMS patients and controls (Table 3), ind icating that altered physiological responses in FMS patients previously described at percentages of measured VO 2,max were mostly due to exercise submaximality. Nevertheless, the larger HR/VO 2 slope and larger RER at 75% of predicted VO 2,max in FMS patients still suggests some impairments of the physiological responses at submaximal intensities. From the individual HR/VO 2 slopes, we extrapolate the VO 2,max that FMS patients would display if they would have reached their maximal theoretical HR ( i.e. 177 \u00b1 6 bpm, similar to maximal HR in controls ; P = 0.24 ). Figure 2A showed that the extrapolated VO 2,max is still lower than VO 2,max measured in controls (28.6 \u00b1 8.8 versus 36.1 \u00b1 7.1 ml.min-1.kg-1; P < 0.05 ). Hence, we proposed that the reduced VO 2,max measured in FMS patients compared to controls is the consequence of i) exercise submaximality ( e.g. due to increased pain perception (8), see below) and ii) metabolic impairments (44). The significant correlation between VO 2,max and the percentage reduction in evoke d muscular responses during the quadriceps fatigue test (Fig. 3A) PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 190 supports the involvement of increased quadriceps fatigability in the reduced exercise capacity of FMS patients. Contrary to HR and VE, RPE in FMS patients i) was similar at 50% and 75% of m easured VO 2,max and higher at 50% and 75% of predicted VO 2,max and ii) was similar at exhaustion compared to controls. The greater increase in RPE and premature maximal RPE achievement in FMS patients appeared to be a key mechanism leading to lower maximal exercise capacity. At least part of the enhanced RPE in FMS patients may be due to greater impairment in quadriceps contractility (Fig. 3B) that might increase muscle afferent input (9, 10) . No relationship could be observed between symptoms reported in q uestionnaires and neuromuscular assessments or exercise capacity as previously reported (6, 15) . Multifactorial components of FMS as well as inter -individual heterogenei ty might explain these results. Limitations It is always challenging to pair control subjects with FMS patients (6). We choose to pair patients and controls for age, BMI and to include sedentary controls in order to avoid the effect of training. Subjects had similar self -reported physical activity but we cannot exclude that the amount of s pontaneous physical activity was lower in FMS patients since we did not measure objective physical activity with accelerometer for instance (4). This may explain at least part of the reduced exercise and muscle performances (8). Additionally, we choose nor mal weight FMS patients and those who agreed to participate to maximal exercise test and neurostimulation. This prevents us to generalize our results to the whole FMS population and larger samples are needed to confirm our results. Future studies may also focus on neuromuscular fatigue assessed with nerve stimulation following locomotor exercise ( e.g. cycling, walking) in order to further clarify the involvement of muscle fatigability versus other mechanisms such as pain perception in functional limitations of FMS patients. PARTIE II: Contribution personnelle ETUDE IV 191 The present investigation showed that reduced quadriceps muscle strength in FMS patients is not due to impaired muscle activation but possibly to reduced muscle mass. Greater alteration in quadriceps contractibility in FMS patients proba bly contribute to enhanced perception of exertion and lowered exercise capacity. These results highlight the importance of considering neuromuscular impairments as a factor contributing to functional limitations in FMS patients and to target muscle functio n in the management of these patients (50).

Thirteen GOLD II -III COPD patients (age = 64\u00b16 yr; BMI = performed constant load cycling at 80% of maximal workload. Before exercise and at exhaustion, twitch quadriceps strength (Q tw), transdiaphragmatic (P di,tw) and gastric (P ga,tw) pressures were evoked by femoral nerve, cervical and thoracic magnetic stimulation, respectively. Changes in operational lung volumes during exercise were assessed via repetitive inspiratory capacity (IC) me asurements. Dyspnoea and leg discomfort were measured on visual analog scale. At exhaustion, Q tw (-35\u00b114%, >15% reduction observed in 12 patients) and P di,tw (- 23\u00b115%, >15% reduction in 8 patients) were significantly reduced ( P<0.05) but not Pga,tw (-6\u00b19%, >15% reduction in 3 patient s).

The rise in end expiratory lung volume and diaphragm flattening associated with dynamic hyperinflation may limit the development of diaphragm and abdominal muscle fatigue in COPD. Keywords: Abdominal muscle; obstructive pulmonary ETUDE V 207 INTRODUCTION Dyspnea but al so leg discomfort are described by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as the primary factors responsible for exercise limitation. Pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in this limitation seem to combine abnormal ventilatory mechanics , impaired O 2 transport and skeletal muscle dysfunction [1, 2] . Their relative contribution to exercise intolerance remains extensively debated [3]. In peripheral locomotor muscle, intrinsic muscle alterations ( e.g. fiber type shift toward type II/IIX, re duced oxidative enzyme activities) contribute to higher with COPD [2, 4] . Enhanced quadriceps fatigability appeared to be present in patients even with preserved strength [4] and may occur in all [5, 6] or only a fraction [2] of patients. Enhanced leg discomfort during exercise may be related to impaired quadriceps contractility [2, 5] . Butcher et al. [7] recently showed that patients with larger level of hyperinflation may exhibit less quadriceps fatigue, su ggesting a relationship between respiratory muscle work and locomotor muscle fatigue [5]. In healthy subjects, inspiratory and expiratory muscle contractile fatigue develops during exercise [8, and can limit performance [10, 11] . In COPD, increased work of breathing results in diaphragm remodeling toward a more fatigue -resistant phenotype and hyperinflation induces structural adaptation to deal with unfavorable strength -length relationship [12]. Despite these ibits impaired contractility [13] is more likely to develop injuries with exertion [14]. However, objective diaphragm fatigue has not been consistently reported following exhaustive exercise, although some patients may exhibit significant amount of fat igue [15- 17]. Concerning expiratory muscles, it is not clear whether weakness is present [18] or absent [19] in COPD patients . Only one study [16] investigated expiratory muscle fatigue following maximal exercise and reported a significant reduction in ab dominal muscle contractility. While dyspnea and mechanical ventilatory constraint appear to be related [1], no data exist concerning the relationship between respiratory muscle fatigue and dyspnea during exercise. Hence, the presence of locomotor and respi ratory muscle fatigue during exhaustive exercise in COPD patients and their relationship with dynamic hyperinflation and PARTIE II: Contribut ion personnelle ETUDE V 208 symptoms remain be further clarified. Accordingly, we evaluated quadriceps, diaphragm and abdominal muscle fatigue induced by constant load cycling using non -volitional strength assessments via magnetic neurostimulation [20, 21] . We hypothesized that i) the amount of dynamic hyperinflation during exercise would impact on respiratory muscle fatigue, and ii) patients with significant amount of muscle fatigue would report the greatest level of dyspnea (patients with respiratory muscle fatigue) or leg discomfort (patients with quadriceps fatigue). METHODS Patients Nineteen patients with COPD (GOLD II -III) were included and gave written inform ed consent. All patients had stopped smoking and were free from cardiovascular, musculoskeletal or neurological diseases. None of the patients had severe exacerbation during the 6 months before the study. All patients were taking bronchodilators and did no t modify their treatments during the study. The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki with approval from the local Ethics Committee. Protocol At screening, spirometry and lung volumes measured according to standard guidelines. On a first visit, patients performed a maximal incremental exercise test on a computer - controlled electrically braked cycle ergometer (Ergometrics 800, Ergoline, Bitz, Germany) with breath -by-breath gas analysis and electrocardiogram (Medisoft, Dinant, Belgium) to determine peak workload capacity (W peak) and O 2 consumption (VO 2,peak). Initial workload was 20 W followed by 2-min increments of 10 W until exhaustion. A fingertip blood sample was obtained 3 min after exhaustion and analyzed for lactate concentration (NOVA+, Nova Biomedical Corporation, Waltham MA, USA). On a second visit (at least 48 h after the first visit and at the latest one week after), subjects performed a constant -load cycling test at 80% of W peak until exhaustion after a 2 -min warm -up at 20 W . Dyspnoea and leg discomfort were assessed each min with a standard PARTIE II: Contribut ion personnelle ETUDE V 209 100 mm visual analog scale. Voluntary inspiratory capacity (IC), end-expiratory (EELV) and end -expiratory lung volume (EILV), minute ventilation and tidal volume (V T) were measured at res t before cycling and each minute during exercise in order to assess dynamic hyperinflation [1]. At each time point, patients performed two IC manoeuvers and the highest value was used for analysis. Before the test (Pre) and immediately after exhaustion (Exh), non -volitional quadriceps and respiratory muscles strength assessments were performed (see below). Data are presented as 30 second averages or the nearest IC measurement corresponding to Pre, 5 min after the start of exercise and immediately before exhaustion. Neuromuscular function Quadriceps. Voluntary strength and mechanical evoked responses to femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) was measured as described elsewhere [20]. The right knee was flexed at 90\u00b0 and the hip angle was 130\u00b0 for proper acc ess to the femoral triangle during FNMS. Voluntary strength and FNMS -evoked mechanical responses were measured with an inextensible strap connected to a strain gauge (SBB 200kg Tempo Technologies, Taipei, Taiwan). FNMS was performed with a 45 -mm figure -eight coil powered by a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, United Kingdom). Single (twitch) stimulations were performed at maximum stimulator output. Optimal stimulation site allowing maximal quadriceps twitch (Q tw) strength was determined and marked on the skin. Patients performed three 5 -s maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with 30 s of rest between each MVC allowing full muscle potentiation [23] prior to a series of six stimulations. After three stimulations, another 5 -s MVC was performed to preve nt depotentiation. The average amplitude (baseline to peak) of all twitches was calculated. Immediately after exercise (Exh), the same procedure was repeated. The procedure for Q tw measurement before and after exercise took 4 to 5 min. Respiratory muscles. Cervical and thoracic magnetic stimulations were performed using a circular 90 -mm coil powered by a Magstim 200 stimulator (MagStim) as previously described [21]. Oesophageal (Poes) and gastric (P ga) pressures were measured by 10 -cm balloon catheters, con nected separately to differential pressure transducers (model DP45 - 30; Validyne, Northridge, CA). Transdiaphragmatic pressure (P di) was obtained by online subtraction of P oes from P ga. Cervical magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves was PARTIE II: Contribut ion personnelle ETUDE V 210 performed while subjects were seated comfortably in a chair with the center of the coil positioned at the seventh cervical vertebra [24]. Thoracic stimulation of the nerve roots innervating abdominal muscles was performed with the center of the coil positioned at the intervertebral level T10 [21]. The best spot allowing the maximal twitch pressures (P di,tw during cervical stimulation and P ga,tw during thoracic stimulation) was determined with minor adjustments and then marked on the skin. The order of cervical and thoraci c stimulations was randomized between subjects but was the same at Pre and at Exh for a given subject. To avoid the confounding effect of potentiation [25], subjects performed three 5 -s maximal inspiratory efforts from functional residual capacity (FRC, fo r cervical stimulation) or three 5 -s maximal expiratory efforts from total lung capacity (TLC, for thoracic stimulation) against a closed airway prior to a series of six stimulations. After three stimulations, another 5 -s maximal voluntary contraction was performed. All stimuli were delivered at FRC, with the airway occluded. To ensure the same lung volume at all times before and after exercise, the experimenter checked that for each subject, pre - stimulation P oes ranged at the same level immediately before each stimulation. Recordings that showed changes in pre -stimulation P oes were rejected post hoc. For data analysis, the average amplitude (baseline to peak) of all remaining twitches (at each stimulation site) was calculated. P oes,tw /Pga,tw ratio during c ervical stimulation was calculated as an index of extra -diaphragmatic inspiratory muscle fatigue [24]. The procedure for P di,tw and P ga,tw measurements took 5 to 6 min. It was performed immediately after Qtw measurement to allow some reduction in ventilati on and dyspnoea after Exh. Strength and pressure signals were digitized (Powerlab, ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia) and recorded simultaneously on a computer (Labchart; ADInstruments; sampling frequency: 2 kHz). A >15% fall in evoked muscular responses (P di,tw, P ga,tw or Q tw) was used as a threshold indicating significant amount of fatigue [2, 17] . Statistical Analysis All descriptive statistics presented are mean values \u00b1SD. Normal distribution and homogeneity of variances analysis were confirmed using th e Kolmogorov -Smirnov and Skewness test, respectively. The alpha level was set at 0.05 for all tests. Paired t -tests were conducted to compare values at Pre and at Exh. To compare changes in variables during the constant -load exercise bout, we used one -way repeated measures ANOVA and t -tests with Bonferroni's correction for post PARTIE II: Contribut ion personnelle ETUDE V 211 determine relationship between variables. Statistical analysis was performed with a statistical software package (NCSS, Kaysville, U tah USA). RESULTS Patients. Among the nineteen patients enrolled in this study, six patients were not considered for analysis because of i) inability to tolerate balloon catheters (n=3), ii) methodological issues regarding balloons catheters (technical p roblem or inability to stimulate at FRC at Exh, n=3). The main characteristics and resting arterial blood gases of the remaining thirteen patients (ten men and three women) are shown in Table 1. Data from the incremental cycling test are shown in Table 2. Cardiorespiratory responses to constant -load cycling. Exercise duration was 10.4\u00b15.5 min and the intensity was 76\u00b113 W. During the last 30 s of exercise, VO 2 reached 18\u00b13 ml.min-1.kg-1 (99\u00b117% reached 58 \u00b112 l.min-1 (107\u00b120% of maximum voluntary ventilation) and heart rate reached 133\u00b120 bpm (93\u00b113% of maximal heart rate during the incremental test). At Exh, SpO 2 was 94.3 \u00b14.2% and no patient had SpO 2 below 85%. Changes in IC, V T, EELV and EILV during exercise are shown in Figure 1. From rest to Exh, IC decrease by 19\u00b110% of predicted value and EELV increased (rising from 5.02\u00b10.84 l to 5.38\u00b11.00 l) in all patients but two. At Exh, inspiratory reserve volume was < 0.8 l (5.5\u00b13.6% of TLC) in all subjects but two. Exercise -induc ed symptoms. At Exh, four of the patients complained primarily of leg discomfort (9.2 \u00b10.8 for leg discomfort versus 7.7\u00b10.5 for dyspnoea), three of the patients complained primarily of dyspnoea (10.0\u00b10.0 for dyspnoea versus 5.3\u00b12.5 for leg discomfort) and six reported similar VAS ratings for dyspnoea and leg discomfort (9.2\u00b11.1 for dyspnoea versus 9.4\u00b10.8 for leg discomfort). Femoral nerve magnetic stimulation. Qtw at Pre and at Exh are shown in Table 3 and in Figure 2. At Exh, Q tw was significantly reduced (-35\u00b114%) and all patients but one had a reduction >15%. The percentage reduction in Q tw did not correlate with the reduction in IC at ETUDE V magnetic stimulation. Pdi,tw at Pre and at Exh is shown in Table 3 and in Figure 2. At Exh, P di,tw was significantly reduced ( -23\u00b115%) and eight patients had a reduction >15%. No significant change in P oes/Pga was observed. Poes immediately before the stimulation was similar at Pre and at Exh (P=0.74). The percentage reduction in P di,tw was significantly smaller than the percentage reduction in Q tw (P<0.001) but correlated with it (Figure 3 A). The percentage reduction in P di,tw correlated with the reduction in IC at 5 min (r=-0.57; P<0.05) and at Exh (Figure 3 B) but not with symptoms (at Exh: dyspnoea r=0.20; P=0.48; stimulation. Pga,tw at Pre and at Exh are shown in Table 3 and in Figure 2. At Exh, the reduction in P ga,tw (-6\u00b19%) was not statistically significant. Three of the patients had a percentage reduction >15%. Poes immediately before the stimulation was similar at Pre and at Exh (P =0.51). The percentage reduction in Pga,tw correlated with the reduction in IC at 5 min ( r=-0.61; P<0.05) and at Exh (Figure 3C) but not with the percentage reduction in P di,tw (r=0.11; P=0.71) and Q ion personnelle ETUDE V 213 DISCUSSION Our study is the first to evaluate exercise -induced locomotor and respiratory muscle fatigue within the same group of COPD patients. Significant reductions in evoke d quadriceps and diaphragm were observed in most of the patients while only few patients had reduced abdominal contractility following exhaustive cycling exercise. The reduction in IC during exercise correlated with the percentage reduction in P di,tw and P ga,tw while no correlation was observed between the amount of muscle fatigue and symptoms of dyspnoea or leg discomfort. Quadriceps fatigue. Significant Q tw reduction at Exh suggests impaired quadriceps contractility. Although we did not measure membrane e xcitability, we are confident that this reduction indicates contractile fatigue since alteration of nerve conduction has never been reported in COPD after cycling to exhaustion [5, 6] . The occurrence of significant amount of fatigue was higher in our and A mman et al. [5] studies (near 100%) compared to Saey et al. [2, 26] and Butcher et al. [7] (ranging from 36 to 68%) . These differences may be due to methodological consideration when using magnetic stimulation (potentiation procedures, stimulation site and time delay between end of exercise and strength measurement) and/or reflect the large heterogeneity of exercise response in COPD patients. We did not observe a significant correlation between dynamic hyperinflation and quadriceps fatigue in contrast with Butcher et al. [7]. This might be explained by highly different prevalence of patients with exercise -induced fatigue between our and Butcher et al. studies and/or by the fact that patients from the latter study participated to a rehabilitation program prio r to the study whereas all patients included in the present study did not. Leg discomfort did not correlate with the magnitude of quadriceps contractile fatigue whereas such a correlation has been observed in some [2, 5] but not all [26] previous works. Th ese contrasted results probably illustrate the contribution of mechanisms other than contractile fatigue ( e.g. central factors) in leg discomfort. Inspiratory muscle fatigue. Significant P di,tw reduction at Exh suggests exercise -induced impairment in diap hragm contractility while unchanged P oes/Pga values indicates predominant diaphragm fatigue [24]. This P di,tw reduction contrasts with previous studies having reported unchanged P di,tw after constant -load cycling at 60 -70 % W peak [16, 17] , incremental cycl ing [16] and II: Contribut ion personnelle ETUDE V 214 stimulations were used and the authors made the assumption that 10 [17] or 20 [15, 16] minutes of rest would be sufficient to avoid exercise -induced twitch potentiation after exercise . We measured fully potentiated responses both before and immediately after exercise by using several MVCs immediately before stimulations to limit potential underestimation of contractile fatigue. Such potentiated twitches have been reported to be more re producible and more sensitive to muscle fatigue [23]. This may explain, at least in part, discrepancies between our results and previous studies. Other factors may also influence the development of diaphragm fatigue during exercise in COPD such as the type and intensity of exercise and patient severity. During exercise, patients exhibit various levels of hyperinflation as previously reported [1]. Interestingly, patients with limited reduction in IC during exercise showed greater diaphragm fatigue than patie nts with larger reduction in IC (Fig. 3B). In patients with large hyperinflation, the diaphragm might make a limited contribution to inspiratory muscle work because of impaired pressure -generating capacity induced by diaphragm flattening [27, 28] . As a con sequence, recruitment of extra diaphragmatic muscle during inspiration may be enhanced to cope with increased elastic loading [28]. The amount diaphragm fatigue appeared to be smaller than the amount of quadriceps fatigue. This result probably illustrates the striking differences between quadriceps and diaphragm phenotypes in COPD patients ( e.g. greater aerobic capacities in diaphragm versus quadriceps) [29]. The 5 min time delay between exhaustion and respiratory muscle assessment due to prior quadriceps fatigue measurement probably had a limited influence since low frequency fatigue as detected by twitches is known to remain for several minutes and hours after exercise [6, 21] . The significant correlation between the percentages reduction in Q tw and P di,tw (Fig. 3A) may indicate i) that some common mechanisms ( e.g. systemic inflammation or oxidative stress) underlie respiratory and locomotor muscle fatigability in COPD patients, and/or ii) a relationship between respiratory and locomotor muscle fatigue th rough a metaboreflex as recently suggested [5]. Abdominal muscle fatigue. Pga,tw at Exh was not significantly reduced during thoracic magnetic stimulation suggesting preserved abdominal muscle contractility following exhaustive cycling in COPD patients. I n a previous work [16], a >10% reduction in P ga,tw occurred in only a fraction of patients (~ 35%) and the group mean reduction was ~7%. In the present study, about 25% of the patients had a >10% reduction in P ga,tw and the mean PARTIE II: Contribut ion personnelle ETUDE V 215 reduction was ~6%, which is quite similar to Hopkinson et al. [16]. Comparisons of Hopkinson data with the present results or previous studies are however difficult since thoracic stimulation was performed at TLC in Hopkinson et al. versus FRC in all other studies. In the present wo rk, patients with mild dynamic hyperinflation had larger reduction in P ga,tw (Fig. 3C). These patients may have a greater abdominal muscle recruitment to limit the rise of EELV [30] and, consequently, may be more likely to develop abdominal muscle fatigue. Hopkinson et al. [16] reported similar dynamic hyperinflation in patients with significant and non -significant abdominal muscle fatigue. However, in a recent study in patients with interstitial lung disease, more abdominal muscle fatigue was observed in p atients who had greater fall in EELV during exercise [31]. Although patients with interstitial lung disease did not exhibit significant increase in EELV during exercise, these findings might support the relationship between dynamic hyperinflation and abdom inal muscle fatigue. We also observed that both inspiratory and expiratory muscle fatigue do no correlate with dyspnea at exhaustion, probably illustrating the multiple factors involved in the perception of dyspnea during exercise [32]. Limitations. In ou r laboratory, both cervical and thoracic magnetic stimulation showed excellent within -day variability and have confirmed their ability to detect both inspiratory and expiratory muscle fatigue [21]. We did not assess the supramaximality of magnetic stimulat ion to limit the number of stimulations. Supramaximal stimulation has been repeatedly confirmed for phrenic nerve and thoracic nerve root [17, 21] and for femoral nerve [6, 20] magnetic stimulation in healthy subjects and COPD. To compare P di,tw and Pga,tw before and after exercise, it is critical to perform stimulation at the same lung volume. Since P oes before stimulation were similar at Pre and at Exh, we are confident that reductions in P di,tw and Pga,tw were not due to differences in lung volume. Becau se of the heterogeneity of exercise responses in COPD patients as emphasized in the present work, further studies should include larger sample size in order to include various patient phenotypes, profiles of respiratory and locomotor muscle fatigue and ven tilatory characteristics. This study showed that patients with GOLD II -III COPD exhibit different amount of exercise -induced fatigue between respiratory muscle and locomotor muscles, with the largest amount of fatigue for the quadriceps, significant fatig ue of the diaphragm and no significant change in abdominal muscle contractility at the group level. Respiratory muscle PARTIE II: Contribut ion personnelle ETUDE V 216 fatigue was shown to be more important in patients with smaller amount of dynamic hyperinflation. Hence, both respiratory and quadriceps fatigue should be considered to understand the complex interplay of factors leading to exercise intolerance in COPD patients and to define individually -tailored therapies.

These alterations can rely upon primary impairments of neuromuscular function and/or second ary impairments caused for instance by a decreased spontaneous physical activity promoted by a chronic disease. Consequently, muscle weakness and enhanced fatigability are frequently reported symptoms in neuromuscular diseases (inherited or noninherited myopathies/neuropathies), cardiovascular (chronic cardiac failure) and respiratory diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) and idiopathic painful syndromes associated with alteration of nociception (fibromyalgia syndrome). The development of reliable and well -tolerated evaluation of muscle strength and fatigue is critical to understand the physiopathology of the diseases and to provide relevant outcomes for both observational and interventional studies. Artificially stimulation has been recognized as a valuable tool for noninvasive assessments of neuromuscular function at rest and during exercise. In particular , magnetic stimulation showed interesting skills to assess both peripheral and respiratory muscles in the cli nical field. During this work, we developed tools to assess muscle strength, endurance and fatigue using magnetic neurostimulation and exercise protocols usable in patients. We studied its reliability in healthy subjects and patients and its ability to det ect differences related to sex, age and training status. Then we used these procedures in neuromuscular diseases and fibromyalgia syndrome to address the impact of alterations of neuromuscular function on symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life. In COPD patients, we assessed respiratory and locomotor muscl e fatigue and studied the relationship between these phenomena and how they impact on exercise response and perceived symptoms. In these patients, we also assessed the combined effects of locomotor and respir atory muscle impact clinique et r\u00e9entra\u00eenement.
