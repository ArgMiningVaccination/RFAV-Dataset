In Israel, it is hard to walk more than a few blocks without spotting a juice stand. Juice stands offer a variety of freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable blend juices. Oranges, apples, pineapples and carrots are commonly found at every stand. Some stands will offer vegetable blends including beets, spinach, and tomatoes while cilantro, mint leaves, parsley, and ginger are also common ingredients that are available. In the fall and winter months, fresh pomegranate is in season and is frequently used.
