Food from Outside the Hospital Rush Copley allows visitors and guests to bring food for patients from outside the campus. However, we ask that patients who have been placed on special diets by their doctors eat meals prepared by the hospital's nutrition services in order to protect their health and safety. We understand that there may be unique circumstances for bringing food from home or outside this facility. Special situations for patients may include: Improving a poor appetite Preparing foods to meet the patient's preferences If you feel you have a special situation, please speak with your caregiver to make arrangements. When bringing a patient food from outside the hospital, please follow these guidelines: Check with the patient's caregiver to make certain the food doesn't conflict with any dietary restrictions. Rush Copley has registered dietitians that can help with any special diet needs for a patient. Dietary restrictions may change on a day-to-day basis. Bring enough food for only one meal at a time. Only unopened containers with expiration dates, such as packaged drinks, pudding or yogurt, can be stored in the unit refrigerator, and only if it has not already entered the patient's room. While patients are hospitalized, their immune systems may be impaired and less able to fight infection. It is important to have good nutrition and food that is served safely. Here are some tips for safe handling: Wash hands, cooking utensils and food surfaces well before cooking. Make sure food is cooked to the proper internal temperature. Cold food should be kept below 40 degrees F in an insulated bag or cooler when transporting from home; use plenty of ice or frozen ice packs. Hot food should be kept hot, at or above 140 degrees F. Wrap it well and place in an insulated container for transport.

Pain Control If you are experiencing pain while in the hospital, please tell your doctor, nurse or any caregiver about it right away. Controlling your pain will help you feel better and recover faster. Pain control can mean proper medications, repositioning or even a backrub. You may be asked to rate your level of pain, with zero being no pain to 10 being the worst possible pain. Use the scale below to describe how much pain you have. Your doctor or nurse will keep track of your pain rating to help determine if the pain control method is helping you. It's best to keep pain levels at five or below, so be sure to alert your doctor, nurse or caregiver before you experience severe pain. If you have experienced side effects from medication in the past, please let us know . Quiet Time Patients and family members may notice quiet time in their unit.

Illinois law recognizes three types of Advance Directives: Power of Attorney for Health Care \u2014 allows you to appoint someone (called your \"agent\") to make health care decisions for you in the future, should you no longer be able to make these decisions yourself. Living Will \u2014 allows you to express in writing to your doctor and family that you do not want death-delaying procedures used if your condition is terminal and your death is imminent. Declaration for Mental Health Treatment \u2014 allows you to express your specific wishes about future mental health treatment and/or to appoint someone (called your \"attorney at fact\") to make these decisions for you, should you no longer be able to make these decisions yourself. We respect your right to complete one or more of these documents, although they are not required and we will not deny you care because you do not have them. For a free informational packet, just ask your caregiver. Please also tell him or her if you have completed any of these documents, so that copies may be added to your medical record and become part of your care plan. If you have further questions, a chaplain or Patient Advocate will assist you. Simply touch the \"Chaplain\" or \"Patient Advocate\" button on your telephone, or call extension 4827 or 4832. Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders We respect each person's right to accept or refuse treatment, including the right to refuse, in advance, the aggressive medical care usually given whenever a person's breathing or heart stops. If you wish that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) not be given in such an emergency, please discuss this with your doctor or caregiver. Your doctor can then write a Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) order so that this wish will be respected. Having a DNR order does not mean that you would be denied other medical and comfort care. Ethics Consultation A special multidisciplinary team is available to assist patients, families, doctors and staff in addressing difficult ethical decisions and situations. If you would like the help of the Ethics Committee, simply touch the \"Chaplain\" or \"Patient Advocate\" button on your telephone, or call extension 4827 or 4832. A Guide to Your Stay 2020 inside pages.qxp_Layout 1 4/29/20 3:40 PM Page 1516Safety and Security Studies show that patients and families can help ensure safety in their care experience. Here is how: Speak up if you have questions or concerns about your medical care. Medical care can become confusing, so please ask for clarification. Your inquiries can be a double-check. Make sure all of your health care providers clean their hands prior to providing care for you. Pay attention to the care you are receiving. Do not hesitate to ask questions so that you feel confident in the care you are receiving. Educate yourself about your diagnosis, the medical tests you are undergoing, and your treatment plan. Our staff is here to educate you. Results of your treatment will be improved with your involvement and awareness. Have an advocate. Some patients find it helpful to have an advocate. Feel free to have a trusted family member or friend involved in your care. This person can intervene on your behalf when necessary. Help us prevent medication errors. Efforts are aggressively made at Rush Copley to prevent medication errors. Your awareness of what medications you are taking and your willingness to question if you are unaware of your medication is essential to prevent medication errors. It is extremely important for you to tell your health care providers all of the medication you are taking at home, including prescriptions, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins and herbal supplements. Finally, participate in all decisions about your treatment. You are the center of your health care team of caregivers at Rush Copley. Your involvement in directing your own care is vital. We welcome your questions or comments about any safety concerns! Identification Wristband The plastic band placed on your wrist during registration contains important identification information, and staff throughout your stay will routinely check your identification band against orders placed by your physician to double- check for accuracy when giving treatments, medications, etc. You may also be given a color-coded \"Alert\" wristband. \"Alert\" wristbands are used in hospitals to quickly communicate a certain health care status or an \"alert\" that a patient may have. The different colors have certain meanings. The health care status is also written on the wristband. A Guide to Your Stay 2020 inside pages.qxp_Layout 1 4/29/20 3:40 PM Page 1617RED means ALLERGY ALERT If you, as a hospitalized patient, have an allergy to anything \u2014 food, medicine, dust, grass, pet hair, latex, ANYTHING \u2014 tell the health care team. It may not seem important to you but it could be very important in the care you receive. YELLOW means FALL RISK Health care workers want to prevent falls at all times. Nurses and other caregivers observe and examine patients throughout their hospital stays to determine if they need extra attention in order to prevent falls. Sometimes a hospitalized patient may become weakened during his/her illness or following surgery. When this patient has a YELLOW color-coded wristband, the nurse and other health care workers are alerted that this person needs to be assisted when walking to prevent a fall. PURPLE means \"DNR\" or DO NOT RESUSCITATE Some individuals have expressed an end-of-life wish and your caregivers want to honor that wish. It is important that you, the patient, and your family know these colors and their meanings because you are an important source of information that can help your caregivers (e.g., physician, nurse) provide the best care. Please wear your wristband at all times. Personal Valuables and Belongings Patients are asked not to bring valuable items to the hospital. If you did bring something valuable, please give the valuables to your family or support person, if available. Otherwise, please ask your hospital caregiver to make arrangements to have your valuables placed with hospital security. You will be given a written receipt for all it ems by hospital security, and the receipt should be presented when the items are retrieved. The hospit al does not accept responsibility for items of value unless they are placed with hospital security. Personal belongings including eyeglasses, contact lenses, dentures and hairpieces are your responsibility. Please label them and keep them close at hand.

Time to Leave Please take time to plan for your post-hospital care before you leave. If you need assistance with post-hospital care, please let your caregivers know. When your doctor decides you are ready to leave the hospital, a discharge order will be written. Please make arrangements with a family member or friend to help you when it is time to go home.

Your Responsibility In order to continue its mission, Rush Copley Medical Center expects payment for services provided. If you have group health or a private insurance plan, you will need to meet certain criteria to receive the full benefits. The explanation of benefits provided by your insurance company is a helpful and necessary resource. If your insurance plan has a prior authorization requirement, please inform your physician or prepare to contact your insurance company yourself. Failure to meet your insurance requirements may result in partial or complete denial of benefits, and you will be responsible for the remaining balance. Your Share and Insurance Coverage Your insurance company will determine how much of the bill will be covered and what balance, if any, will be your responsibility. If your insurance company is slow in paying, Rush Copley reserves the right to bill you directly. It is important to check with your insurance company to find out what portion of the bill will be covered and what portion is your share. Physician fees for medical services including emergency room services, X-ray (radiology), NICU, anesthesia and pathology will be billed separately from the hospital, as these services are all provided by independent physicians. Rush Copley accepts MasterCard, Discover and VISA. Payments can be made by phone, online at rushcopley.com, in person, or by mail. Call the cashier at extension 6864, or stop by the cashier's office, located near the Outpatient entrance.
