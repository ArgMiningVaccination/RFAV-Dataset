General Background and Description of State Approach to Child Health Covera ge (Section 2102 (a)(1) - (3)) and (Section 2105)(c)(7)(A) - (B)) 2.1 Describe the extent to which, and manner in which, children in the state including targeted low -income children and other classes of children, by income level and other relevant factors , such as race and ethnicity and geographic location, currently have creditable health coverage (as defined in 42 CFR 457.10). To the extent feasible, make a distinction between creditable coverage under public health insurance programs and public -private partnerships (see Section 10 for annual report requirements). (42 CFR 457 .80(a)) Uninsured Children Based on the State Demographer's 2002 population estimates, the DHCFP has estimated that there are 69,000 children in Nevada who are uninsured living in families with incomes under 200% of federal poverty level. Of these, as many as 50% may be eligible for Medicaid. These numbers are based on limited and sometimes seemingly contradictory data. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that for 1996, there were 45,000 uninsured children under 200% of federal poverty level in Nevada, but also estimated that there were 77,000 uninsured at all income levels. This would mean that less than 60% of all uninsured would be under 200% of federal poverty level. The national average is 73%. Only five other states (Alaska, Massachusetts, Vermont, Hawaii, and New Jer sey) are under 60%, all of whom have significantly higher Medicaid eligibility levels than Nevada, resulting in a greater level of coverage for low -income children. Effective Date: July 1, 2009 Page 7 Approval Date: ___________ With regard to demographic data, the best information comes from a survey of the uninsured in Nevada completed in June 2000, and updated as of January 2003, by the Great Basin Primary Care Association and the State Demographer's 2002 population estimates. The following chart reports on these findings as follows: Number of Uninsured Children in Nevada by Region Age in Years Washoe County Clark County Rural Counties Totals Less than 6 6,209 30,493 3,534 12,549 112,258 Estimates Nevada Populations According to the current Nevada State Demographer's data, Nevada's total population is 2,210,650. Nevada's children age 0 -19 comprise the following races by age and sex: Age in Years White Black American Indian Asian Hispanic Total <5 103,60 1 11,157 spoken at home by Nevadans According to the 2000 Census Supplementary Survey Summary Tables, Nevada's language spoken at home is as follows: Nevadans Age >5 years No English at home 78% Speak English at home 81% Speak Spanish at home 5% No English at home (see breakdown at right) 19% Speak language other than 17% Don't speak English well English or Spanish Effective Date: July 1, 2009 Page 8 Approval Date: ___________ Public Health Insurance Coverage Medicaid is Nevada's major pu blic health insurance program. In 1967, Nevada implemented the Medicaid program for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) now Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Child Welfare, Aged, Blind, and Disabled populations, and in 1985 imp lemented the Child Health Assurance Program (CHAP) for pregnant women and later for pregnant women with children. Nevada is at the federal minimums for eligibility, 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) for children up to age six and 100% of FPL for chil dren six and older born on or after October 1, 1983. Currently, TANF and CHAP Medicaid eligible children residing in Clark County are enrolled in mandatory managed care, with the exception of disabled children and those children who reside more than 25 mil es from a primary care physician (PCP) and participating hospital, pursuant to NAC 695C.160. Nevada Check Up Nevada Check Up provides access to affordable health insurance to children in working, low-income families. The program features simplified mail -in eligibility applications and low premiums while providing a comprehensive health benefits package. Differences between Nevada Check Up and Nevada Medicaid - There are areas where Medicaid policy and Nevada Check Up policy differ. They are: 1) Residential Treatment Centers (RTC) - In Nevada Check Up, it remains the HMO's responsibility to provide reimbursement for all medical care (physician, optometry, labora tory, dental and x -ray services, etc.) for participants who are receiving services in an RTC. The RTC bed day rate is covered by FFS. In Medicaid, those who are admitted to an RTC are disenrolled from the HMO and receive all Medicaid -covered services as F FS recipients. 2) Severely Emotionally Disturbed (SED)/Seriously Mentally Ill (SMI) - In Nevada Check Up, this group must receive evaluation and medically appropriate services through a FFS provider if the family resides in a FFS area. In mandatory HMO ge ographic areas, SED determinations don't permit disenrollment from the HMO, so the HMOs will provide appropriate services. In Medicaid, once a diagnosis of SED or SMI is confirmed through evaluation, a recipient may elect to disenroll from the HMO and the HMO must notify the DHCFP of such election. Effect ive Date: October 1, 2016 Page 9 Approval Date: November 23, 2016 3) Newborns - In Nevada Check Up, if a family is expecting a child, whether the adult female in the home or one of the enrolled children, Nevada Check Up must be notified within 14 days of the birth, the newborn, if eligible, will be added to the family as of its date of birth. If the notification criterion is not met, the child, if eligible, will be added the next administrative month following notification. A newborn cannot be enrolled before a family's start date. A newborn will begin services at the same time as the other children in the family. One exception for the Checkup program is if the mother has other coverage for the newborn, and she has other children enrolled in Nevada Check Up, the newborn will be enrolled in Nevada Check Up as of the first day of the next administrative month following date of birth. In Medicaid, all children born to Medicaid -enrolled mothers are enrolled as of their date of birth. 2.2. Describe the current state efforts to provide or obtain creditable health coverage for uncovered children by addressing: (Section 2102)(a)(2) (42 CFR 457.80(b)) 2.2.1 The steps the state is currently taking to identify and enroll all uncovered children wh o are eligible to participate in public health insurance programs (i.e. Medicaid and state -only child health insurance): Nevada currently has several initiatives to enroll children in Medicaid and Nevada Check Up. These include outreach and referral services to the Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), Nevada Early Interventio n Programs, Family Resource Centers (FRCs), Family to Family program, Tribal Administrators, Tribal Clinics and Indian Health Services (IHS), Resources for the Early Advancement of Child Health (REACH) Program, Connecting Kids to Health Coverage, Nevada 21 1 and Nevada Health Link -Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. In addition, out stationed eligibility workers are in certain public hospitals and federally qualified health centers in order to provide these outreach and referral services. The description s of these programs are as follows: 1. The Medicaid program is administered by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy and provides health coverage to low -income and disabled Nevada children. Nevada takes the following steps to enroll children in Me dicaid: a. Nevada State Welfare District Offices located throughout the state determine a person's eligibility for TANF, CHAP, and Medicaid. If applicants appear to be Nevada Check Up eligible, rather than Medicaid, they are appropriately referred. Out stationed sites (FQHCs, county hospitals, and local county health departments) help people apply for Medicaid or Nevada Check Up and send their applications and eligibility determination to the local Nevada State Welfare District Office. Effective Date: October 1, 2016 Page 10 Approval Date: November 23, 2016 Local public h ealth agencies identify low income, uninsured children through referrals from a variety of sources including: WIC, child health and immunization clinics, community health and social services agencies, and schools. 2. Women, Infants and Children (WIC) provide s nutritious food to supplement the regular diet of pregnant women, infants, and children under age five who meet state income standards. Women and children under five years old qualify if the combined family income is at or below 185% of the federal pover ty level. WIC staff encourages pregnant women and parents in this program to apply for Medicaid or Nevada Check Up, depending on their income level. 3. Federally Qualified Health Centers offer health care to low -income people. Nevada has 13 federally qualifi ed community health centers. The centers provide primary care services including care for acute and chronic illness, injuries, emergency care, diagnostic services and prescriptions. Community health centers take the following steps to enroll children in Medicaid or Nevada Check Up: 1. Provide a financial screen for each new patient or family 2. Provide information on and explanation of the program(s) for which family members may be eligible. 3. Assist with completing applications and collecting required documentati on. 4. Forward applications to the determining agency and communicate with family about eligibility status. If a patient/family is not eligible for any program, the community health center will provide the health care services and will use its sliding fee scale according to family size and income to determine the fee. 4. Nevada Early Intervention Programs The Nevada Early Intervention Programs provide direct services to low - income children ages 0 -3 under the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant (Title V). Se rvices include well child clinic services, including developmental and physical assessments and immunizations. Children who appear to qualify for Medicaid or Nevada Check Up are encouraged to apply. 5. Family Resource Centers A total of 26 Family Resource Centers (FRCs) have been established in high risk neighborhoods throughout Nevada, and an additional two are scheduled to open in the next year. The FRCs are community -based centers run by not -for-profit organizations with state grants and private contributions. Their aim is to provide information about available social services including Medicaid and Nevada Check Up, and how to access Effec tive Date: October 1, 2016 Page 11 Approval Date: November 23, 2016 those services. Sites also provide some services (e.g. child care) based on the needs of the community. Nevada Check Up staff have participate d with Family Resource Centers in the coordination of health fairs. 6. Family to Family Program The Family to Family program is an initiative aimed at informing new mothers of the services that are available to them and how to access such services. A total of two centers have been established throughout the state. These centers are community based and operate as public/ private partnerships. New mothers are able to receive a home visit, get questions answered about parenting issues and services available to aid them in raising their children, including health insurance through Medicaid and Nevada Check Up. 7. Tribal Adminis trators, Tribal Clinics, and Indian Health Services (IHS) Nevada Check Up staff attends and participates in meetings of the Native American Advisory Council, as mandated by Nevada law, in order to share information and receive advice as to the needs of the Native American tribes in Nevada. Application training and program updates are also provided by program staff. 8. The DHCFP is proposing the use of Health Services Initiative (HSI) funding to integrate the Resources for the Early Advancement of Child Health (REACH) program into after school programs serving the highest risk schools in Nevada that will be prioritized by the mandated environmental scan. The implementation of these innovative changes supports Nevada children in achieving a physical and emoti onally safe environment by incorporating the REACH pilot project within the targeted schools. This approach will also allow the program to be scaled up or down based on available funding and the individualized school 's needs. The individualized school need s will be identified per data tracking by utilizing the newly implemented statewide longitudinal data system to track outcomes and compare cohorts within the same school as well as compare to schools across the state. The HSI public health approach allows the services to be provided to all children in a targeted area regardless of payer source. The DHCFP will work with current after -school program(s) to determine capacity for providing the services within their current structure or coordinate with communit y providers who have the capacity to create a collaboration to provide these services. The DHCFP will be working to identify these groups to determine the best model for payment of these programs based on the community infrastructure and capacity. Effective Date: September 1, 2008 Page 12 Approval Date: ___________ The HSI option allows the state to take a population health approach to behavioral health and early intervention for children. HSI also provides the flexibility to pilot the rising -risk concept across children ages 10 through 18 with the goal of being able to demonstrate the effectiveness of early intervention through the use of performance measures. The scope of services will target early intervention and preventive services and mental health resources to prevent the onset of a future behavioral health dia gnosis. The DHCFP provides assurance that the HSI program will not supplant or match CHIP federal funds with other federal funds, nor allow other federal funds to supplant or match CHIP federal funds . 9. Connecting Kids to Health Coverage The Connecting K ids to Coverage will identify children who are eligible for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and support targeted strategies needed to enroll eligible children who do not have health coverage, including application as sistance and outreach . 10. Nevada 2 -1-1 Nevada 2 -1-1, a program of the Financial Guidance Center, is committed to helping Nevada citizens connect with the services they need, whether by phone or internet. The goal is to present accurate, well -organized an d easy-to-find information for the state and local health and human services program. 11. Nevada Health Link - Silver State Health Insurance Exchange The state utilized Navigator Organizations, Certified Enrollment Assistant and is based on their attendanc e of community events, community involvement, and health care provider engagement eligibility screening. 2.2.2 The steps this state is currently taking to identify and enroll all uncovered children who are eligible to participate in health insurance progr ams that involve a public/private partnership . Other than the referrals received from Family Resource Centers, there are no public/private partnerships in Nevada offering health insurance to low -income children. 2.3. Describe the procedures the state use s to accomplish coordination of SCHIP with other public and private health insurance programs, sources of health benefits coverage for children, and relevant child health programs, such as Title V, that provide health care services for low -income children to increase the number of children with creditable health coverage. (Previously 4.4.5) (Section 2102)(a )(3) and 2102(c)(2) and 2102(b)(3)(E)) (42 CFR 457.80(c)) This issue is addressed in the above Section 2.2. Effective Date: April 1, 2020 Page 13 Approval Date: July 10, 2020 Section 3. Methods of Delivery and Utilization Controls Check here if the State elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the State's Medicaid plan, and continue on to Section 4 (Eligibility Standards and Methodology) . Guidance: In Section 3.1, describe all delivery methods the State will use to provide services to enrollees, including: (1) contracts with managed care organizat ions (MCO), prepaid inpatient health plans (PIHP), prepaid ambulatory health plans (PAHP), primary care case management entities (PCCM entities), and primary care case managers (PCCM); (2) contracts with indemnity health insurance plans; (3) fee -for-servic e (FFS) paid by the State to health care providers; and (4) any other arrangements for health care delivery. The State should describe any variations based upon geography and by population (including the conception to birth population).

If the State uses a managed care delivery system for only some of its CHIP populations and a fee -for-service system for some of its CHIP populations, please describe which populations are, and which are not, included in the State's managed ca re delivery system for CHIP. States will be asked to specify which managed care entities are used by the State in its managed care delivery system below in Section 3.1.2. Chip eligible members that reside in urban Washoe or Clark counties are mandatorily e nrolled into one of three contracted MCOs, and a dental PAHP. Guidance: Utilization control systems are those administrative mechanisms that are designed to ensure that enrollees receiving health care services under the State plan receive only appropriate and medically necessary health care consistent with the benefit package. Effective Date: April 1, 2020 Approval Date: July 10, 2020 Page 14 Examples of utilization control systems include but are not limited to: requirements for referrals to specialty care; requirements that clinicians use clinical practice guidelines; or demand management systems (e.g., use of an 800 number for after -hours and urgent care). In addition, the State should describe its plans for review, coordination, and implementation of utilization controls, addressing both procedures and State developed standards for review, in order to assure that necessary care is delivered in a cost -effective and efficient manner.

Written notice will be provided to families when the quarterly premium is thirty days past due; Thirty additional days will be allowed to receive payment. Consequently, a 60-day grace period is allowed prior to disenrollment for failure to pay the quarterl y premium. Children can remain in the program annually, if they continue to meet the eligibility criteria. 4.1.9 Other standards: Social Security numbers are required for children being enrolled in the Nevada Check Up program, except for newborns. Soci al Security Numbers for newborns will be required on the child's first birthday . 4.2. The state assures that it has made the following findings with respect to the eligibility standards in its plan: (Section 2102)(b)(1)(B)) (42 CFR 457.320(b)) 4.2.1. These standards do not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis. Effective Date: September 1, 2011 Page 57 Approval Date: ___________ 4.2.2. Within a defined group of covered targeted low -income children, these standards do not cover children of higher income families without covering children with a lower family income. 4.2.3 These standards do not deny eligibility based on a child having a pre - existing medical condition. 4.3. Describe the methods of establishing eligibility and continuing enrollment. (Section 2102)(b)(2)) (42 CFR 457.350) Eligibility is determined through the completion of an application form which includes the following information: 1) Name, date of birth, resident address, gender, Social Security Number, citizenship status, age, ethnicity (optional) and relationship to applicant of all chi ldren in the househ old who are seeking enrollment; 2) Name of person(s) responsible for health care costs of a child; 3) All sources of income as defined in 4.1.3 from all persons residing in the household and contributing to or benefiting from the support of th e household; 4) All adults residing in the household; 5) Insurance status, including whether a child is currently or has been insured within the last six months; and 6) If determined eligible: children declared to be citizens will be enrolled. In addition, the applicant/participant must provide proof of income for each household member. Proof of income may include but is not limited to copies of two c urrent pay stubs from each job dated within 90 days prior to the eligibility determination. For newly hired employees, a signed statement from their employer may be accepted. If self -employed, the applicant may be required to submit a copy of the most rece ntly filed federal/state income tax return. NCU may accept a client statement of income to determine eligibility for newborns. Nevada Check Up (NCU) may require additional documentation to determine projected gross annual income from self-employment (including but not limited to bank statements and information about household expenses). The applications are processed and those individuals found eligible are enrolled. If the family is found to have a prior unpaid premium balance, an approval letter i s sent requesting the past due balance be paid, at which time the child will be enrolled. For those individuals found eligible without past due balances, an enrollment letter is sent along with an invoice for the first premium (which may be an amount suffi cient to cover one, two or three months, depending on the date enrollment begins). Program enrollment begins on the first day of the next administrative month. The enrollment letter includes the following information: Household Nevada Check Up ID number; Names of eligible children and their ID numbers; Name of health plan (Managed Care Organization (MCO) or Fee for Service (FFS)); Effective month of enrollment; and The current amount due and the quarterly premium amount . Effective Date: January 27, 2020 Page 58 Approval Date: June 4, 2020 Native Americans who are members o f federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Natives are exempt from premium payment. For subsequent eligibility determinations, all children enrolled in the program will stay in the program as long as the family income is below the program maximum and they m eet all eligibility requirements. If necessary, the applicant is sent a letter requesting additional or missing information. Enrollees are required to notify Nevada Check Up immediately with any changes to their address and/or telephone number. Any mail r eturned indicating the family is no longer at the address may cause disenrollment due to \"Loss of Contact\". To address the Federal COVID -19 public health emergency, requirements related to timely processing of renewals and deadlines for families to respon d to renewal requests may be temporarily waived for CHIP beneficiaries. During a state or federally -declared disaster and at the state's discretion, the state may implement the following changes to its enrollment and redetermination policies for beneficiaries living and/or working in a state or federally -declared disaster areas: The state will temporarily us e the regulatory timeliness exception for timely processing of CHIP applications under 42 CFR 457.340(d)(1). The state will temporarily use the regulatory timeliness exception for timely processing of CHIP renewals under 42 CFR 457.340(d)(1). 4.3.1. Describ e the state's policies governing enrollment caps and waiting lists (if any). (Section 2106(b)(7)) (42 CFR 457.305(b)) Check here if this sectio n does not apply to your state. Nevada Check Up will monitor the status of available State and Federal SCHIP funds. An enrollment cap will be placed on the number of new enrollees if it is necessary for the program to stay within available fund s. Prior to implementation of an enrollment cap and waiting list, pursuant to NRS 422.2368, the State will provide 30 days of public notice and will conduct a public hearing. The State also will provide notification to CMS. The enrollment cap may be set above or below current enrollment. If the cap is set below current enrollment levels, enrollment will be closed until the level of the cap is reached. If the cap is set above current enrollment levels, enrollment may continue until the cap is reached, and then enrollment will be closed. Once enrollment is closed, new applications will continue to be accepted through the normal process. NCU eligibility would be run on all applications. The applications of individuals that appear to be eligible for Medicaid w ould be forwarded to Medicaid for eligibility determination. Those applicants not eligible for Nevada Check Up will be denied with the appropriate reason. The applicants that are eligible for Nevada Check Up but are not able to be enrolled due to the enrol lment cap will be denied utilizing the Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 59 Approval Date: ___________ standard program denial process. Their denial reason will be, \"denied enrollment due to enrollment cap. \" These applicants will be notified of the waitlist process. They will also be notified that their child/ren may b e eligible for Medicaid if their circumstances change while they are on the waitlist. They will be put on the wait list with a waitlist date equal to the date when Nevada Check Up received the completed application. On a monthly basis, Nevada Check Up wil l make an assessment of the number of enrollees against the appropriated funds for the program. As additional funds become available (either through attrition of enrollees or more funding is identified) a determination will be made as to the number of new enrollees that can be accommodated with the identified funds. The applicants on the wait list will be notified of the availability of coverage. Notification will go out first to those applicants with the earliest wait list date; thus a first come, first se rved process. To update eligibility, if the update is within the 12 month continuous coverage period, applicants would need to attest that there have not been any changes to their family circumstances (e.g. number in household, income, insurance status, an d the like). If changes have occurred, the new information would be added into the Nevada Check Up database and eligibility redetermined. Enrollees determined eligible prior to any enrollment cap will not be impacted by this particular change so long as th ey continue to pay premiums timely and comply with any requests for information, including income, household, citizenship and identity verification. Enrollees who are disenrolled from the program for failure to timely pay premiums or for failure to timely complete their redetermination process or provide requested information will be precluded from reenrollment during any cap period and will be added to the wait list. These members will receive notice by direct mail informing them of their review rights as required by governing regulations. 4.4. Describe the procedures which assure: 4.4.1. The state explains the procedures used to ensure that children who have other creditable coverage or children who have access to coverage under a State health plan due to a parent's employment with a public agency do not receive coverage under SCHIP. Neva da Check Up uses screening procedures at intake, annual eligibility determinations, and reevaluations that target low -income children, who are ineligible for Medicaid or not covered under a group health plan or health insurance coverage (including access t o a state health benefits plan). Children who are found eligible may receive health benefits under Nevada Check Up. (Section 2102)(b)(3)(A)) and 2110(b)(2)(B)) (42 CFR 457.310(b) (42 CFR 457.350(a)(1)) 457.80(c)(3)) The application contains a screening qu estion asking if the child has had other health care insurance or Medicaid coverage. If the child had past health care coverage, follow up questions are asked as to when and why the coverage ended. Effective Date: February 1, 2018 Page 60 Approval Date: June 7, 2018 In order to be enrolled in Nevada Check Up, children must have been without creditable insurance for at least six months prior to the date of application. This should provide a disincentive to families to drop current coverage. The exceptions to the six -month waiting period are for children losing Medicaid and f or families who lose insurance due to circu mstances beyond their control. In those cases, Nevada Check Up coverage would not be a substitution for coverage under group health plans and the six -month \"waiting period\" does not apply. In order to ensure that those eligible for coverage under a State health plan are not enrolled in Nevada Check Up, completed applications and income documentation are screened to determine the place and nature of employment. Anyone who is identified as wor king for an organization listed in the Public Employee Benefit Program employer list and/or those who provide a State agency pay stub and are eligible for benefits based on employment status, are denied coverage. Nevada Check Up also provides Third Party Liability cross matches on a monthly basis with any participant who has been identified to have other medical coverage. Those participants appear on a report that identifies the policy holder, the policy carrier, effective dates of coverage and the policy type. This information is used to disenroll the participants who have other medical coverage and are receiving Nevada Check Up benefits. 4.4.2. The Medicaid application and enrollment process is initiated and facilitated for children found through the screening to be potentially eligible for medical assistance under the state Medicaid plan under Title XIX. (Section 2102(b)(3)(A) and 2110(b)(2)(B)) (42 CFR 457.310(b) (42 CFR, 457.350(a)(1) and 457.80(c)(3)) In order to assure that Medicaid eligible chil dren are enrolled in Medicaid, Nevada takes the following steps: 1) A Medicaid application functions as both an application for Nevada Check Up and for Medicaid eligibility. All initial applications, redeterminations and reevaluations for Nevada Check Up and Medicaid are processed through the use of an electronic screening tool , single point of entry, that determines if a child may be eligible f or Nevada Check Up or Medicaid. 2) Nevada Check Up enrollees are electronically screened daily to ensure that children are not enrolled in both Nevada Check Up and Medicaid. 3) Nevada Check Up also monitors referrals to D WSS to ensure timely Medicaid determinations . 4.4.3 The State is taking steps to assist in the enrollment in SCHIP of children determined ineligible for Medicaid. (Section 2102( a)(1) and (2) and 2102(c)(2)) (42 CFR 431.636(b)(4)) A file containing detailed information about children who have been found ineligible for Medicaid is provided electronically to the Nevada Check Up program. This file will provide information on childre n who appear to meet the eligibility Effective Date: February 1, 2018 Page 61 Approval Date: June 7, 2018 requirements for Nevada Check Up. This information is uploaded electronically into the Nevada Check Up database and these children are enrolled on the first day of the next administrative month following eligibility ver ification. At the same time the family is notified of eligibility, they are billed for the Nevada Check Up premium, including a date by which premium must be paid. Children already enrolled in Nevada Check Up who are subsequently placed in the custody or financial responsibility of an agency which provides child welfare services pursuant to the provisions of NRS 62A.380 or 432.010 to 432.085, inclusive, or Chapter 432B of NRS are disenrolled and made eligible for Medicaid. Once the child is returned home, the household must notify Nevada Check Up of his/her residency status in order to re -enroll the child. 4.4.4. The insurance provided under the state child health plan does not substitute for coverage under group health plans. Chec k the appropriate box. (Section 2102)(b)(3)(C)) (42 CFR 457.805) (42 CFR 457.810 (a) - (c)) 4.4.4.1. Coverage provided to children in families at or below 200% FPL Describe the methods of monitoring substitution. Persons covered by insurance providing hospital and medical services are not eligible for benefits under Nevada Check Up. In order to apply for Nevada Check Up, children are req uired to have been without creditable insurance for at least six months prior to the date of enrollment. (Certain exceptions apply as noted in 4.1.7 and also include those whose only coverage was Medicaid) The Nevada Check Up application form includes a question regarding other insurance coverage within the last six -month period. The State gathers information on a monthly basis on the number of applicants who were denied because they had other insurance coverage in the last six months. This provides a disin centive to families to drop current coverage. Caseworkers review the applicants' pay stubs to determine if dependent premiums are being deducted by the employer. The DHCFP monitors overall health insurance coverage for children and determines additional s teps to be taken if substitution (crowd out) appears to be taking place. When applicants indicate they have had previous coverage within the past six months, there is further screening to determine the circumstances by which that coverage ended. The fiscal agent and the Managed Care Organizations screen claims for other insurance coverage and inform Nevada Check Up if other insurance is found, in which case a disenrollment notice is sent for the next administrative month. 4.4.4.2. Coverage provided to ch ildren in families over 200% and up to 250% FPL: describe how substitution is monitored and identify specific strategies to limit substitution if levels become unacceptable. 4.4.4.3. Coverage provided to children in families above 250% FPL: describe how substitution is monitored and identify specific strategies in place to prevent substitution.

Child health assistance is provided to targeted low -income children in the state who are Native American and Alaska N ative (Section 2102)(b)(3)(D)) (42 CFR 457.125(a)) Native American and Alaska Native children are provided the same opportunity for enrollment as all other children. These families are exempt from cost sharing. Effective Date: February 1, 2018 Page 63 Approval Date: June 7, 2018 Section 5. Outreach (Section 2102(c)) Describe the procedures used by the state to accomplish: Outreach to families of children likely to be eligible for assistance or other public or priv ate health coverage to inform them of the availability of the programs and to assist them in enrolling their children in such a program: (Section 2102(c)(1)) (42 CFR 457.90) Nevada Check Up conducts multi -faceted outreach and referral efforts to inform families of the availability of state sponsored health care coverage for children under both Nevada Check Up and Medicaid. These efforts are supported by the Northern and Southern Covering Kids and Families Coalitions' outreach efforts as well as ot her community partners. Nevada has established a toll free telephone number for people who want an application form mailed. The number is also used for providing assistance in completing the application and answering questions about the program. Assistan ce in Enrolling Children The most important \"assistance\" provided is the use of a simple application form which enables most parents to submit applications without direct help. Community -based organizations are trained to assist families in filling out the application and answer questions applicants may have about the program. Nevada Check Up also has an internet website which includes applications in English and Spanish for downloading. Families can print this application, complete it and mail to the desi gnated address located on the application alon g with the necessary additional documents. The website also includes an electronic application which can be completed and submitted electronically as a single point of entry . The family is required to mail the income verification and other required documentation to be matched with the internet application. TN No: 22-0014 Effective Date: June 1, 202 2 Page 64 Section 6.

(Section 1905(r)(5)) The provision of all requested EPSDT screening services, as well as any corrective treatments needed based on those screening services, are provided or arranged for as necessary. (Section 1902(a)(43)) All families with children eligible for the EPSDT benefit under the separate State child health plan are provided information and informed about the full range of services available to them. (Section 1902(a)(43)(A)) Guidance: For states seeking deemed compliance for their entire State child health plan population, please continue to Section 6.3. If not all of the covered populations are offered EPSDT, the State must conduct a parity analysis of the benefit packages provided to those populations. Please continue to 6.2.3 - MHPAEA. Mental Health Parity Analysis Requirements for States Not Providing EPSDT to All Covered Populations Guidance: The State must complete a parity analysis for each population under the State child health plan that is not provided the EPSDT benefit consistent with the requirements 42 CFR 457.496(b). If the State provides benefits or limitations that vary within the child or pregnant woman populations, states should perform a parity analysis for each of the benefit packages. For example, if different financial requirements are applied according to a beneficiary's income, a separate parity analysis is needed for the benefit package provided at each income level. Please ensure that changes made to benefit limitations under the State child health plan as a result of the parity analysis are also made in Section 6.2. 6.2.3 - MHPAEA. In order to conduct the parity analysis, the State must place all medical/surgical and TN No: 22-0014 Effective Date: June 1, 202 2 Page 75 mental health and substance use disorder benefits covered under the State child health plan into one of four classifications: Inpatient, outpatient, emergency care, and prescriptio n 457.496(d)(2)(ii); 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(ii)(B)) 6.2.3.1 - MHPAEA.

The State assures that: The State has classified all benefits covered under the State plan into one of the four classifications. The same reasonable standards are used for determining the classification for a mental health or substance use disorder benefit as are used for determining the classification of medical/s urgical benefits. 6.2.3.1.2 - MHPAEA. Does the State use sub -classifications to distinguish between office visits and other outpatient services? Yes No 6.2.3.1.2.1 - MHPAEA. If the State uses sub -classifications to distinguish between outpatient office visits and other out patient services, the State assures the following: The sub -classifications are only used to distinguish office visits from other outpati ent items and services and are not used to distinguish between similar services on other bases (ex: generalist vs. specialist visits). Guidance: For purposes of this section, any reference to \"classification(s)\" includes sub- classification(s) in states using sub -classifications to distinguish between outpatient office visits from other outpatient services. 6.2.3.2 - MHPAEA. The State assures that: Mental health/ substance use disorder benefits are provided in all classifications in which medical/surgical benefits are provided under the State child he alth plan. Guidance: States are not required to cover mental health or substance use disorder benefits (42 CFR 457.496(f)(2)) . However , if a state does provide any mental health or substance use disorder benefits , those mental health or substance use diso rder benefits must be provided in all the same classifications in which medical/surgical benefits are covered under the State child health plan (42 CFR 457.496(d)(2)(ii) . Annual and Aggregate Lifetime Dollar Limits 6.2.4 - MHPAEA. A State that provides b oth medical/surgical benefits and mental health and/or substance use disorder benefits must comply with parity requirements related to annual and aggregate lifetime dollar limits for benefits covered under the State child health plan. (42 CFR 457.496(c)) 6.2.4.1 - MHPAEA. Please indicate whether the State applies an aggregate lifetime dollar limit and/or an annual dollar limit on any mental health or substance abuse disorder benefits covered under the State child health plan. TN No: 22-0014 Effective Date: June 1, 202 2 Page 77 Aggregate lifetime dollar limit is applied Aggregate annual dollar limit is applied No dollar limit is applied Guidance: A monetary coverage limit that applies to all CHIP services provided under the State child health plan is not subject to parity requirements. If there are no aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits, please go to section 6.2.5 - MHPAEA. 6.2.4 .2 - MHPAEA. Are there any medical/surgical benefits covered under the State child health plan that have either an aggregate lifetime dollar limit or an annual dollar limit? If yes, please specify what type of limits apply. Yes (Type(s) of limit:) No Guidance: If no aggrega te lifetime dollar limit is applied to medical/ surgical benefits, the State may not impose an aggregate lifetime dollar limit on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits. If no aggregate annual dollar limit is applied to medical/surgical benef its, the State may not impose an aggregate annual dollar limit on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits. (42 CFR 457.496(c)(1)) 6.2.4.3 - MHPAEA . States applying an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on medical/surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits must determine whether the portion of the medical/surgical benefits to which the limit applies is less than one - third, at least one -third but less than two -thirds, or at least two -thirds of all medical/surgi cal benefits covered under the State plan (42 CFR 457.496(c)).

If yes, specify the classification(s) of benefits in which th e State applies one or more QTLs on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits. Yes (Specify:) No Guidance: If the state does not apply any type of QTLs on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification, the state meets parity requirements for QTLs and should continue to Section 6.2.6 - MHPAEA. If the state does apply QTLs to any mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the state must conduct a parity analysis. Please continue. 6.2.5.1 - MHPAEA Does the State apply any type of QTL on any medical/surgical benefits? Yes No Guidance: If the State does not apply QTLs on any medical/surgical benefits, the State may not impose quantitative treatment limitations on mental health or substance use disorder benefits, please go to Section 6.2.6 - MHPAEA related to non -quantitative treatment limitations. 6.2.5.2 - MHPAEA Within each classification of benefits in which the State applies a type of QTL on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the State must determine the portion of medical and surgical benefits in the classification which are s ubject to the limitation. More specifically, the State must determine the ratio of (a) the dollar amount of all payments expected to be paid under the State plan for medical and surgical benefits within a classification which are subject to the type of qua ntitative treatment limitation for the plan year (or portion of the plan year after a mid -year change affecting the applicability of a type of quantitative treatment limitation to any medical/surgical benefits in the class) to (b) the dollar amount expecte d to be paid for all medical and surgical benefits within the classification for the plan year. For purposes of this paragraph, all payments expected to be paid under the State plan includes payments expected to be made directly by the State and payments w hich are expected to be made by MCEs contracting with the State. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(C)) The State assures it has applied a reasonab le methodology to determine the dollar amounts used in the ratio described above for each classification within which the State TN No: 22-0014 Effective Date: June 1, 202 2 Page 80 applies QTLs to mental health or substance use disorder benefits. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(E)) Guidance: Please include the sta te's methodology and results as an attachment to the State child health plan. 6.2.5.3 - MHPAEA.

For each type of quantitative treatment limitation applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the State assures: The same reasonable methodology applied in determining the dollar amounts used to determine whether substantially all medical/surgical benefits within a classification are subject to a type of quantitative treatment limitat ion also is applied in determining the dollar amounts used to determine the predominant level of a type of quantitative treatment limitation applied to medical/surgical benefits within a classification. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(E)) The level of each type of quantitative treatment limitation applied by the State to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification is no more restrictive than the predominant level of that type which is applied by the State to medical/surgical benefits within the same classification.

TN No: 18-008 Approval Date: June 6, 2019 Effective Date: October 2, 2017 Page 93 6.4.2 - BH Please describe the state's strategy to facilitate the use of validated assessment tools for the treatment of behavioral health conditions. The st ate requires the use of the Child and Adolescent Service Intensity Instrument (CASII) tool for children 6 -18 years of age and requires the use of the Early Childhood Service Intensity Instrument (ECSII) through the Targeted Investments Program for the 0 -5 population. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria is required for adults and adolescents receiving behavioral health services, who have been identified as having a substance use disorder. The use of these instruments is outlined in th e Medicaid Services Manual (MSM) Chapter 400. The use of these instruments is reimbursable to providers to support and encourage implementation. The information in MSM Ch. 400 pertains to the CHIP population. The MSMs are publicly available and when the re is any update to policy, this follows the public notice and public hearing process within the state to engage providers in feedback of these updates. Any updates are disseminated through Web Announcements published on the Nevada Medicaid website. In a ddition to the public hearing process, the state engages the public through public workshops when new policies are being determined to gather as much feedback as possible. 6.2.5 - BH Covered Benefits The State assures the following related to the provisi on of behavioral health benefits in CHIP: All behavioral health benefits are provided in a culturally and linguistically appropria te manner consistent with the requirements of section 2103(c)(6), regardless of delivery system. The state will provide all behav ioral health benefits consistent with 42 CFR 457.495 to ensure there are procedures in place to access covered services as well as appropriate and timely treatment and monitoring of children with chronic, complex or serious conditions. 6.4. Additional Purchase Options - If the State wishes to provide services under the plan through cost effective alternatives or the purchase of family coverage, it must request the appropriate option. To be approved, the State must address the following: (Secti on 2105(c)(2) and (3)) (42 CFR 457.1005 and 457.1010) 6.4.1. Cost Effective Coverage - Payment may be made to a State in excess of the 10% limitation on use of funds for payments for: 1) other child health assistance for targeted low -income children; 2) expenditures for health services initiatives under the plan for improving the health of children (including targeted low - income child ren and other low -income children); 3) expenditures for outreach activities as provided in Section 2102(c)(1) under the plan; and 4) other reasonable costs incurred by the State to administer the plan, if it demonstrates the following (42CFR 457.1005(a)): 6.4.1.1. Coverage provided to targeted low -income children through such expenditures must meet the coverage requirements above; Describe the TN No: 18-008 Approval Date: June 6, 2019 Effective Date: October 2, 2017 Page 94 coverage provided by the alternative delivery system. The State may cross reference Section 6.2.1 - 6.2.28. (Section 2105(c) (2)(B)(i)) (42 CFR 457.1005(b)) 6.4.1.2. The cost of such coverage must not be greater, on an average per child basis, than the cost of coverage that would otherwise be provided for the coverage described above; Describe the cost of such coverage on an average per child basis. (Section 2105(c)(2)(B)(ii)) (42 CFR 457.1005(b)) Guidance: Check below if the State is requesting to provide cost -effective coverage through a community -based health delivery system. This allows the State to waive the 10 percent lim itation on expenditures not used for Medicaid or health insurance assistance if coverage provided to targeted low -income children through such expenditures meets the requirements of Section 2103; the cost of such coverage is not greater, on an average per child basis, than the cost of coverage that would otherwise be provided under Section 2103; and such coverage is provided through the use of a community -based health delivery system, such as through contracts with health centers receiving funds under Secti on 330 of the Public Health Services Act or with hospitals such as those that receive disproportionate share payment adjustments under Section 1886(c)(5)(F) or 1923. If the cost -effective alternative waiver is requested, the State must demonstrate that payments in excess of the 10% limitation will be used for other child health assistance for targeted low -income children; expenditures for health services initiatives under the plan for improving the health of children (including targeted low -income children and other low -income children); expenditures for outreach activities as provided in Section 2102(c)(1) under the plan; and other reasonable costs incurred by the State to administer the plan. (42 CFR, 457.1005(a)) 6.4.1.3. The coverage must be provided t hrough the use of a community -based health delivery system, such as through contracts with health centers receiving funds under Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act or with hospitals such as those that receive disproportionate share payment adjustm ents under Section 1886(c)(5)(F) or 1923 of the Social Security Act. Describe the community -based delivery system. (Section 2105(c)(2)(B)(iii)) (42 CFR 457.1005(a)) Guidance: Check 6.4.2. if the State is requesting to purchase family coverage. Any State requesting to purchase such coverage will need to include information that establishes to the Secretary's satisfaction that: 1) when compared to the amount of money that would have been paid to cover only the children involved with a comparable package, th e purchase of family coverage is cost effective; and 2) the purchase of family coverage is not a substitution for coverage already being provided to the child. (Section 2105(c)(3)) (42 CFR 457.1010) 6.4.2. Purchase of Family Coverage - Describe the plan to purchase family coverage. Payment may be made to a State for the purpose of family coverage unde r a TN No: 18-008 Approval Date: June 6, 2019 Effective Date: October 2, 2017 Page 95 group health plan or health insurance coverage that includes coverage of targeted low-income children, if it demonstrates the following: (Section 2105(c)(3)) (42 CFR 457.1010) 6.4.2.1. Purchase of family coverage is cost -effective. The State's cost of purchasing family coverage, including administrative expenditures, that includes coverage for the targeted low -income children involved or the family involved (as applicable) under premium assistance programs must not be greater than the cost of obtaining coverage under the State plan for all eligible targeted low -income children or families involved; and (2) The State may base its demonstration of cost effectiveness on an assessment of the cost of coverage, including administrative costs, for children or families under premium assistance programs to the cost of other CHIP coverage for these children or families, done on a case -by- case basis, or on the cost of premium assisted coverage in the aggregate. 6.4.2.2. The State assures that the family coverage w ould not otherwise substitute for health insurance coverage that would be provided to such children but for the purchase of family coverage. (Section 2105(c)(3)(B)) (42 CFR 457.1010(b)) 6.4.2.3. The State assures that the coverage for the family otherwise meets Title XXI requirements. (42 CFR 457.1010(c)) 6.4.3 -PA: Additional State Options for Providing Premium Assistance (CHIPRA # 13, SHO # 10 -002 issued February 2, 2010) A State may elect to offer a premium assistance subsidy for qualified employer -spon sored coverage, as defined in Section 2105(c)(10)(B), to all targeted low-income children who are eligible for child health assistance under the plan and have access to such coverage.

Quality and Appropriateness of Care Check here if the state elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the state's Medicaid plan, and continue on to Section 8. 7.1 Describe the methods (including external and internal monitoring) used to assure the quality and appropriateness of care, particularly with respect to well -baby care, well -child care, and immunizations provided under the plan. (2102(a)(7)(A)) (42 CFR 457.495(a)) The DHCFP performs the same readiness review process, less those issues wh ich are specific to Medicaid, prior to allowing the MCO contractor to deliver services under the Nevada Check Up program. Overall program monitoring to assure quality and appropriateness of care will be performed on an ongoing basis by the following activities: 1) Review and analysis of encounter and financial data; 2) Review of participant and provider complaints and grievances filed with the State In surance and/or Health Division; 3) The compilation, review and investigation, where warranted, of c onsumer satisfaction data; and 4) Establishment of quality and performance measures for well-baby care, well child care, and immunization monitored through encounter data and chart review. Contract monitoring is performed through the following actions: 1) Annu al quality and operational review of each contractor; 2) Identical encounter data reporting (in form, format, and periodicity) as required under the Medicaid Managed Care program (to the extent that such services are program benefits under the contract); 3) Revi ew of the contractors and contract data by an External Quality Review Organization (EQRO); 4) Generation of Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) reporting, depending on program benefits under the contract, with the same periodicity, form and format as under the Medicaid Managed Care program; 5) Performing on -site review, if problems of a material nature arise; 6) Performance of a yearly member satisfaction survey by the DHCFP and/or the MCO contractors with review, analysis and follow -up (as required) by the State. 7) Complaints filed by enrolled participants with the MCO plans. Participating plans are contractually required to report complaints on a quarterly basis. These reports are shared with enrolled participants who request the information. In addition, the DHCFP will track the information on the number and type of complaints filed by participants enrolled in a plan. Complaint information is used by the DHCFP to identif y plan performance needing improvement and to form the basis of future performance standards. Effective Date: September 1, 2008 Page 99 Approval Date: ___________ 8) The DHCFP works with the state's two health insuran ce industry regulatory entities (i.e., the Division of Insurance and the Health Division) to ensure all publicly available data on health plan performance is known to the DHCFP. Will the state utilize any of the following tools to assure quality? (Check all that apply and describe the activities for any categories utilized.) 7.1.1 Quality standards The state utilizes quality standards for the Nevada Check Up program identical to those currently used under the Medicaid Managed Care Program. The following clinical areas of concern are monitored: 1. Comprehensive Well Baby and Well Child Periodic Health Screening Standard Well Baby/Well Child screenings comprise a comprehensive health and developmental history, unclothed physical exam, and visio n, dental, and hearing evaluations with follow -up. When indicated appropriate diagnostic and treatment services must be provided. Periodic screening will be completed on behalf of all eligible children between the ages of 0 through 18, according to the mos t current HEDIS guidelines. An interperiodic screening is one which is provided at medically necessary intervals to determine the existence of physical or mental illnesses or conditions of concern, or to follow up on previously diagnosed health problems. Such screening exams must be provided at the request of a parent, guardian, health, or educational professional. 2. Childhood Immunizations Standard Age appropriate immunizations will be documented in the medical record unless documentation is provided of e xemption due to State law. Age appropriate immunizations required by the State are those recommended by a recognized medical academy and/or required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) The MCO is responsible for implementing the most re cent immunization schedule as endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Nevada Health Division. 3. Family Planning Standard Family planning services are provided to Nevada Check Up eligible children, both male and female, of child bearing age. Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 100 Approval Date: ___________ 4. Dental Services Standar d Dental services (including medically necessary orthodontia, if prior authorized) are provided to Nevada Check Up eligible participants. 5. Medical Record Standards Standard The MCO must maintain medical records in accordance with Standard XII of the \"Guidelines for Internal Quality Assurance Programs\" as set forth in the CMS Medicaid guidelines. 6. Appointment Standards Standard Ninety percent of appointments must meet time criteria (both for waiting and for number of days between request and appointme nt). 7.1.2 Performance measurement Performance measurements for each of the Quality Standards noted in 7.1.1 are similar to or the same as those currently utilized in the Medicaid Managed Care program. 1. Comprehensive Well Baby and Well Child Periodic and Interperiodic Health Assessments - Periodic screening A. Measurement 1. Eighty Percent of Nevada Check Up eligible children who are enrolled for 12 months must have an age appropriate periodic screening. HMO or MCO compliance is monitored by a quar terly evaluation of encounter data and, if indicated, liquidated damages will be calculated based on the initial annual review; that is, 12 months of the contract year. Liquidated Damage: (number of required Periodic screenings not completed) x (Periodic screening fee) = liquidated damage. 2. Annually, a chart sample of Nevada Check Up eligible children will be reviewed. During chart review, areas of critical concern are age appropriate developmental, dental, vision and hearing screenings with follow -up when indicated by diagnostic and treatment activities and/or referrals. The timely scheduling and completion of interperiodic screening upon request, accompanied by Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 101 Approval Date: ___________ necessary follow -up activities, will be assessed during the chart review. Corrective action: If chart reviews suggest poor quality of medical care and/or inadequate follow up activities and treatment, the DHCFP may direct the MCO to conduct a study of particular areas of concern. In cases of immediate concern, a simultaneous ref erral to the Division of Insurance and the Health Division may be initiated for further examination of appropriateness and quality of care within the existing scope of each agency. B. Method Encounter data, chart review, analysis of number and nature of comp laint reports, and participant/guardian surveys are analyzed and evaluated. C. Frequency The DHCFP will generate quarterly reports from encounter data with an annual cumulative report. An annual on -site review with an emphasis on chart review will be conducted by the DHCFP and/or an EQRO. Chart review may be conducted more often than annually, if indicated by encounter data, complaints, etc. 2. Childhood Immunizations A. Measurement Documentation showing 90% of Nevada Check Up eligible non - exempt participants, ages zero through two are appropriately immunized. Documentation showing 95% of Nevada Check Up eligible non -exempt participants, ages three through 18 are appropriately immunized. Nevada Check Up clients must have been enrolled for 12 months before compliance with required percentages is calculated. For tracking purposes in managed care, each immunization (vaccine) will include two encounter codes. One code will indicate administration of a specific vaccine; the second code will indicate a history of receiving a specific immun ization. An action plan will be required from the MCO if compliance is less than 90% for children ages zero through two and/or less than 95% for those who are ages three through 18. B. Method Encounter data, chart review, and analysis of number and nature of complaints reported. Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 102 Approval Date: ___________ C. Frequency The DHCFP generates quarterly reports from encounter data with an annual cumulative report. An annual review is conducted by the DHCFP and/or an EQRO. 3. Family Planning A. Measurement 80% of eligible participants of child bearing age receive age appropriate education and services regarding family planning. A chart sample of participants who are enrolled for at least six months will be reviewed for compliance. At a minimum, documentation indicating that family planning information was offered or provided must be evident in the participant's record. An action plan is required if the percent of compliance is less than 80%. B. Method Encounter data, chart review and verification of service fro m participants whose records were reviewed will be evaluated; analysis of number and nature of complaints reported, and participant/parent/ guardian surveys will be analyzed and evaluated. C. Frequency The DHCFP will generate quarterly reports and an annual cumulative report utilizing encounter data submitted by the MCO. The DHCFP will conduct an annual review. If the reviewed sample does not meet the minimum percentage criteria, follow -up will be conducted by the DHCFP staff. 4. Dental Services A. Measurement Twenty percent of Nevada Check Up participants, ages three to five, who have been enrolled at least 12 months will receive at least one oral health screening, referral and follow -up for necessary diagnostic and preventive services; and, 50% of participants, ages five to 18, wh o have been enrolled for 12 months will receive at least one dental visit in the reporting year. B. Method Encounter data, chart review and verification of service from participants whose records were reviewed will be evaluat ed. An analysis of the number and nature of complaints reported, with the participant/parent/guardian surveys will be analyzed and evaluated. Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 103 Approval Date: ___________ C. Frequency The DHCFP will generate quarterly reports and an annual cumulative report utilizing encounter data subm itted by the MCO. The DHCFP will conduct an annual review. If the reviewed sample does not meet the minimum percentage criteria , follow -up will be conducted by the DHCFP and/or EQRO staff. 5. Appointment standards A. Measurement 1. Appointments with primary care providers (PCP): The MCO shall have procedures in place that ensure: a. Same day primary care provider appointments for symptoms which are of sudden or severe onset but which do not require emergency room service are available; b. Urgent care PCP appointments are available within two calendar days; and, c. Routine care PCP appointments are available within two weeks. This two -week standard does not apply to regularly scheduled visits to monitor a chronic medical condition, if the schedule calls for vi sits more frequently than once every two weeks. 2. Specialty appointments For specialty referrals to physicians, therapist and other diagnostic and treatment health care providers the MCO shall provide: a. Same day appointments within twenty -four hours of referrals as in 1) (a) above; b. Urgent care appointments within three calendar days of referral; and c. Routine appointments within two weeks 3.

Office Waiting Times The MCO plans shall monitor and ensure that a participant's waiting time at the PCP or specialist's office is not more than one hour from the scheduled appointment time, except when the provider is unavailable due to an emergency. Office waiting times may be delayed when they \"work in\" urgent cases, when a serious problem is found, or when the patient had an unknown need that requires more services or education than was described at the time the appointment was made. A Plan of Correction (POC) will be required if the 90% Standard is not met. a. Method The DHCFP and/or an EQRO will validate this annually by means of on -site observations, chart reviews, enrollee satisfaction surveys, review of grievances and interviews with enrollees. b. Frequency The DHCFP and/or the EQRO will conduct reviews of available data at least annually. 6. Medical Records Standards A. Measurement Of the 16 elements of medical record keeping, nine are critical and must be present in each record. The critical items for medical record keeping are as follows: 1 ) patient identification information; 2) personal/biographical data; provider legibility; 6) allergies; 7) immunizations; 8) medication information; and 9) identification of current problems. A sample of the MCO's Nevada Check Up participants' medical records will be reviewed: 90% of records reviewed must contain medical record keeping and patient visit data items indicated as critical. An action plan will be required if the percent of standard is less than 90%. B. Method Medical records will be reviewed. Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 105 Approval Date: ___________ C. Frequency Record reviews will be conducted annually by the DHCFP and /or an EQRO. If the reviewed sample does not meet the minimum criteria, a corrective action plan will be required from the MCO and follow -up will b e done by the DHCFP staff. (Please note that the specific standards may be altered as a result of contract negotiations.) 7.1.3 Information strategies A new one -step application and enrollment process is being developed and was implemented as of July 2 003. At the time of application completion, the head of household must choose a health plan from information provided on the application. Nevada Check Up eligibility specialists enters the MCO or Fee-for- Service information while determining eligibility. Nevada Check Up enrolled families receive a handbook from their chosen health plan which describes the benefits provided to enrollees under the program. These materials also describe enrollee rights and responsibilities and the specific steps to file a co mplaint. The DHCFP will collect information from the health plans on a quarterly and annual basis. This reporting provides information on enrollment, demographics, ethnic characteristics, outreach efforts, use of medical and dental services, enrollee grie vance information, and data on financial expenditures. Information is used by the DHCFP to document performance and assure adequate program accountability. The Division, MCO and/or the External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) will conduct yearly consu mer satisfaction surveys no more than three months after the end of the first year of the contract and every year thereafter. This data is compiled and analyzed. Where areas of concern exist, an audit will be performed and if the area of concern is valid, the MCO will be required to produce a plan of correction as is currently required under the Medicaid Managed Care program. 7.1.4. Quality improvement strategies Quality improvement strategies, with which the MCO contractor must comply, are as follows: 1. Requirements for written policies and procedures regarding prior authorization standards and criteria, and for periodic review and updating of said policies and procedures; 2. Policies and procedures regarding utilization review activities, including reports to state agencies on methods from reviewing, and follow -up activities required based on the outcome of the review activities; 3. Establishment (including requirements) of a quality assurance program designed to direct, evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of health care Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 106 Approval Date: ___________ services provided to its enrollees. The program must include, as defined in the Nevada Statutes, without limitat ion: a. A method for analyzing the outcomes of health care services; b. Peer review; c. A system to collect and maintain information related to the health care services provided to enrollees; d. Recommenda tions for remedial actions; and e. Written guidelines that set for th the procedures for remedial action when problems related to quality of care are identified. 4. Corrective action plans will be required as indicated above, where quality standards, consumer satisfaction surveys or performance measurements are below those s tated standards; 5. In severe or blatant cases of non -compliance, the Division will assess liquidated damages for not meeting performance measures. 7.2.1 Describe the methods used, including monitoring, to assure: (2102(a)(7)(B)) (42 CFR 457.495) 7.2.1. Access to well -baby care, well -adolescent care and childhood and adolescent immunizations. (Section 2102 (a) (7)) (42 CFR 457.495 (a)). Refer to Section 7.1.1., Item 1. & 2. Section 7.1.2., Item 1. & 2. All Nevada Check Up participants are encouraged to seek well-baby and well - child care. The MCO contracts contain standards for well -baby and well -child visits at not less than the national baseline average, along with the immunizations recommended in Section 7.1.1., N umber 2. The contract standards include esta blishing, maintaining, and reporting on records of these visits and immunizations. They are also required to send out reminder notices to families that a well -child check or immunization is due. FFS providers are expected to comply with the American Academ y of Pediatrics periodicity schedule for well -baby and well -child care purposes. The Medicaid Managed Care contract requires that HEDIS measurements be used to evaluate an MCO's performance. The MCO's HEDIS immunization measurement rates must be comparabl e to the HEDIS National Medicaid average. The contract includes provision for development of corrective action plans if performance is not adequate. 7.2.2. Access to covered services, including emergency services as defined in 42 CFR 457.10. (Section 2102 (a) (7 )) (42 CFR 457.495 (6)) Emergency Services: The MCOs cannot require participants to seek prior authorization for services in a medical or behavioral health emergency. MCOs must inform their enrollees that access to covered emergency services is not restri cted and that if the participant experiences a medical or behavioral health emergency, he/she may obtain services from a non -plan physician or other qualified provider without penalty. However, health plans may deny payment for such a visit should the visi t be determined as a non -emergency using a Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 107 Approval Date: ___________ prudent layperson standard. The health plan may require members to obtain prior authorization for any recommended or requested follow -up care pursuant to the emergency. 7.2.3. Appropriate and timely procedures to monito r and treat enrollees with chronic, complex, or serious medical conditions, including access to an adequate number of visits to specialists experienced in treating the specific medical condition and access to out -of-network providers when the network is no t adequate for the enrollee's medical condition. (Section 2102 (a) (7)) (42 CFR 457.495 (c)). Refer to Section 7.1.1., Item 6. and Section 7.1.2., Item 5. Service Accessibility : The MCO must take measures to ensure compliance with the access standards. The DHCFP monitors MCO performance and will take action if problems are identified. Access to care analyses will be based on the results of participant satisfaction surveys participant complaint data, and appointment scheduling. The number of participants enrolled will be used to determine the adequacy of the MCO's panel of PCPs and specialists. The contract with managed care providers requires that their Enrollee Services Departments assist enrollees in obtaining out -of-area and out -of-networ k care. The children in Nevada Check Up's Fee-for-Service component are free to seek services from any Medicaid provider in the state. Out -of-state and out -of- network providers will be accepted if they are willing to abide by the terms of Nevada Check Up c laims payment rates and processes. The participants enrolled in fee -for-service have more direct access to specialists and out -of-state providers in that their care is directed by their primary care physicians who will often make referrals for the particip ants. The Medicaid district offices will also assist Nevada Check Up families with access to care. Twenty -Four Hour Coverage : The MCO must provide health care coverage to its members, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. The MCO must instruct their enrol lees how to obtain services after business hours and on weekends. Telephone Access : The MCO may require their PCPs to have primary responsibility for serving as after-hours \"on-call\" telephone resources to members with medical problems. Whether or not the plan assigns primary responsibility for after-hours telephone access to a PCP, it must have a 24-hour toll free telephone number for members to call, which must be answered by a live person. Days to Appointment: The MCO must abide by the following appointment standards: Urgent medical or behavioral problems within 24 hours; Non-urgent \"sick visits\" with in 48 hours, as clinically indicated; Routine, non -urgent or preventive care visits within two weeks: and Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 108 Approval Date: ___________ In-plan, non -urgent mental health or substance abuse visits within two weeks. 7.2.4. Decisions related to the prior authorization of health services are completed in accordance with State law or, in accordance with the medical needs of the patient, within 14 days after receipt of request for services (Section 2102 (a) (7)) (42 CFR 457.495 (d)) State licensed MCOs are the principal health plan providers fo r enrollees who reside in areas served by managed care. Under Nevada Revised Statute 695C, these entities are subject to oversight and regulation by the Division of Insurance (DOI). The DOI is primarily responsible for monitoring initial capitalization and financial solvency. The Health Division is charged with monitoring quality of care and assuring the availability of and accessibility to health services. Requests for prior authorization are within the purview of this section. The MCOs are allowed a maxi mum of 14 days from the date of receipt of the request to provide an answer. In accordance with Title 42CFR 457.495(d)(1), there is allowance for an additional 14 days if the participant requests an extension or if the health care provider determines addit ional information is needed. Nevada Check Up Fee-for-Service prior authorization requests are processed by the fiscal agent and are completed in the same manner and time frames as are required for Medicaid. To obtain licensure, certain requirements regard ing availability and access must be satisfied by a n MCO. These requirements are: Coverage for basic health services, including emergency services; Provisions for access to primary care physician for each subscriber; Evidence of arrangements for the ten mo st commonly used specialists; Policies on obtaining referrals for specialty care; Physician and provider network capacities. Many of these requirements are evaluated: initially upon licensure; upon request for service area expansion; and periodically through complaint and grievance monitoring; and on -site visits by both Divisions. To participate in the Nevada Check Up program, MCOs must establish and maintain provider networks with sufficient number of providers in each contracted geograp hic service area. The MCOs' networks must contain all provider types necessary to provide to its enrollees a continuum of services which includes primary and preventive care and includes the diagnosis, management and treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions, as well as specialized care to handle complex health problems. The MCO must include the provider types necessary to furnish the prepaid benefit package, including: hospitals; physicians (primary care and specialists); mental health and substanc e abuse providers; nursing homes; and pharmacies. If an MCO is unable to provide the medically necessary covered service within its provider network, it must Effective Date: April 1, 2008 Page 109 Approval Date: ___________ allow the participant to obtain the service through an out -of-network provider. The MCO must facil itate the referral to an out -of-network provider on behalf of the enrollee and must reimburse the out -of-network provider at not less than the Medicaid FFS rate for the covered service. MCOs shall not include in their networks any medical provider who has been sanctioned by Medicare or Medicaid. Effective Date: July 21, 2022 Page 110 Approval Date: October 7, 2022 Section 8. Cost S haring and Payment (Section 2103(e)) Check here if the state elects to use funds provide d under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the state's Medicaid plan , and continue on to Section 9. 8.1. Is cost -sharing imposed on any of the children covered under the plan? 8.1.1. YES 8.1.2. NO, skip to question 8.8. 8.2. Describe the amount of cost -sharing and any sliding scale based on income, the group or groups of enrollees that may be subject to the charge and the service for which the charge is imposed or time period for the charge, as appropriate. (Section 2103(e)(1) (A))(42CFR 457.505(a), 457.510(b) & (c), 457.515(a) & (c)) 8.2.1. Premiums: A quarterly premium is charged per family based on gross income, except for American Indians who are members of federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Natives, who are exempt from premiums. Starting April 1, 2008, families whose incomes are at or above 176% of FPL, the premium is $80 per quarter ($320 per year). For families whose incomes are at or above 151% FPL but at or below 175% FPL, the premium is $50 per quarter ($200 per yea r). For families whose incomes are at or above 36% FPL up to 150% FPL, the premium will be $25 per quarter ($100 per year) and these families are offered the option of paying their premium monthly, rather than quarterly. For families whose incomes are belo w 36% FPL, the premium is zero. These enrollees are either Medicaid referrals or have assets that would preclude their enrollment in Medicaid. Families whose incomes are at or below 150% FPL are notified on the premium notice that Nevada Check Up premiums may be paid on a monthly basis. To address the Federal COVID -19public health emergency, premiums may be waived for CHIP applicants and/or bene ficiaries who meet income and other eligibility requirements. To address the Federal COVID -19 public health emergency, the premium lock -out policy is temporarily suspended, and coverage is available regardless of whether the family has paid their outstanding premium for existing beneficiaries. During a state or fede rally-declared disaster and at the state's discretion, the state may waive premiums for CHIP applicants and/or beneficiaries who reside and/or work in a state or federally -declared disaster areas. 8.2.2. Deductibles: There are no deductibles. 8.2.3 Coins urance: There is no coinsurance . 8.2.4 Other : Effective Da te: January 27, 2020 Page 111 Approval Date: June 4, 2020 8.3 Describe how the public will be notified, including the public schedule, of this cost - sharing (including the cumulative maximum) and changes to those amounts and any differences based on income: (Section 2103(e)) ((1)(B)) (42 CFR 457.505 (b)) The cost sharing information is explained to potential enrollees through the application, which includes a chart of income eligibility and premium payment amounts on its cover. If changes are necessary to the cost sharing requirements of Nevada Check Up, all current enrollees are notified by letter of th e changes and effective dates. P ublic hearings are held to allow the public to comment on any proposed changes to cost sharing in Nevada Check Up. Effective Date: August 24, 2002 Page 112 Approval Date: ___________ 8.4. The state assures that it has made the following findings with respect to the cost sharing in its plan: (Section 2103(e)) 8.4.1. Cost-sharing does not favor children from higher income families over lower income families. (Section 2103(e)(1)(B)) (42 CF R 457.530) 8.4.2. No additional cost -sharing applies to well -baby and well -child care, -appropriate immunizations. (42 CFR 457.520) 8.4.3. No additional cost -sharing applies to the costs of emergency medical services delivered outside the network. (Section 2103 (e) (1) (A)) (42 CFR 457.515 (f)) 8.5 Describe how the state will ensure that the annual aggregate cost -sharing for a family does not exceed 5 % of such family's annual income for the length of the child's elig ibility period in the State. Include a description of the procedures that do not primarily rely on a referral given by the State for overpayment by an enrollee: (Section 2103 (e) (3) (B)) (42 CFR 457.560 (b) and 457.505 (e)) The cost sharing requirements are set at very low levels so it is extremely unlikely that any families over 150% of FPL could approach the 5 % cap. For a family of two at 150% of FPL, the 5 % cap is $994 ($19,898 x .05); the total Nevada Check Up annual premiums are $100. For a fami ly of two at 166% of FPL, the 5% cap is $1,101 ($22,020 x .05); the total Nevada Check Up annual premiums are $200. For a family of two at 200% of FPL, the 5 % cap is $1,327 ($26,531 x .05); the total Nevada Check Up annual premiums are $320. To further illustrate how low Nevada Check Up's premium amounts are, a family of two with income of $13,265 is at 100% FPL and, if eligible for enrollment in Nevada Check Up, would pay $100 each year in premiums, less than 1% of their income. The maximum allowed for SCHIP cost sharing in this case is $663 per year. At the extreme low level (36% FPL) of those charged premium fees, the 5% cap equals $239 annually and Nevada Check Up premium totals $100. The State does not impose any other co -payment or deductible. 8.6 Describe the procedures the state will use to ensure American Indian (as defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976) and Alaska Native children will be excluded from cost sharing. (Section 2103 (b) (3) (D)) (42 CFR 457.535) The instructional s ection of the application states that premiums are waived for any household with an American Indian or Alaska Native child. Additionally, the application includes an ethnicity question and through self-declaration , the family indicates each child's ethnici ty. This information is utilized to derive the premium notices. The Nevada Check Up database includes an edit to set the premium amount to zero if an American Indian or Alaska Native child is in the household. Effective Date: July 21, 2022 Page 113 Approval Date: October 7, 2022 8.7. Please provide a description of the consequences for an enrollee or applicant who does not pay a charge. (42 CFR 457.570 and 457.505 (c)) The applications will be processed and thos e found eligible are enrolled subject to a full enrollment limitation. Written notice will be provided to families , no later than seven days after the start of the grace period, when the quarterly premium is past due; additionally , a final notice indicatin g disenrollment will be sent 30 days prior to the potential disenrollment action. (Notices generate at system cutoff approximately five days prior to the end of the month and are mailed the next day allowing at least 30 days' notice ) If payment is not rece ived prior to the intended disenrollment date the children will be disenrolled at the end of the two -month grace period. All past due balances must be paid prior to new enrollment. (i.e. Premium request for January/February/March (new coverage period) is mailed November 29 , 2011 . If payment not received, l ate notice mailed December 7 , 2011. No payment, final notice mailed January 24, 2012, indicating termination effective February 29, 2012. If payment is received by February 24, 2012, coverage will continue .) American Indians who are members of federally recognized Tribes and Alaska Natives are exempt from paying premiums. Exception to Disenrollment for Failure to Pay Premiums: During a state or federally - declared disaster and at the state's discretion, as stated in Section 8.2.1, the state may waive premiums for CHIP applicants and/or beneficiaries who reside and/or work in state or federally -declared disaster areas. Therefore, the state will not disenroll beneficiaries for failure to pay premiums. Additionally, the state may waive any unpaid premium balance and waive the premium lock -out period for CHIP beneficiaries who reside and/or work in state or federally - declared disaster areas. 8.7.1 Please provide an assurance that the following disenrollment protections are being applied: State has established a process that gives enrollees reasonable notice of and an opportunity to pay past due premiums, co -payments, coinsurance, deductibles, or similar fees prior to disenrollment. (42 CFR 457.570 (a)) Participating families are always given 30 days written notice of any action that will result in their disenrollment from Nevada Check Up. The disenrollment process affords the enrollee an opportunity to show that the enrollee's family income has decline d prior to disenrollment for non-payment of cost -sharing charges. (42 CFR 457.570 (b)) Families who receive notices of impending disenrollment are encouraged to respond with documentation that will assist eligibility staff to modify their premium and allow their continued enrollment in Nevada Check Up. In the instance mentioned above, that the state will facilitate enrolling the child in Medicaid or adjust the child's cost -sharing category as appropriate. (42 CFR 457.570 (b)) Effective Date: September 1, 2011 Page 114 Approval Date: ___________ Nevada Check Up denies enrollment and refers all children to Medicaid who appear to be Medicaid eligible at the time of application. Families who are Medicaid eligible must apply for Medicaid and cooperate with the Medicaid eligibility process. These families are not considered for enrollment in Nevada Check Up until any Medicaid questions have been resolved and/or their circumstances change with the result that they are no longer Medicaid eligible. Cost sharing is always adjusted based on family income. The state provides the enrollee with an opportunity for an impartial review to address disenrollment from the program. (42CFR 457.570 (c)) Nevada Check Up letters always include information on how to request a review of any decision that impacts the family's enrollment. 8.8. The state assures it has made the following findings with respect to the payment aspects of its plan: (Section 2103 (e)) 8.8.1. No Federal funds will be used toward state matching requirements. (Section 2105 (c)(4)) (42 CFR 457.220) The DHCFP ensures that no Federal funds accounts for in any way to make them appear as if they were part of a state match. 8.8.2. No cost -sharing (including premiums, deductibles, copays, coinsurance and all other types) will be used toward state matching requirements. (Sect ion 2105 (c) (5)) (42 CFR 457.224) Cost sharing funds received by Nevada Check Up are used only to defray administrative costs of the program. 8.8.3. No funds under this title will be used for coverage if a private insurer would have been obligated to p rovide such assistance except for a provision limiting this obligation because the child is eligible under this title. (Section 2105 (c)(6)(A)) (42 CFR 457.626 (a)(1)) Nevada Check Up does not provide insurance to families who have private insurance or have access to affordable private insurance. 8.8.4. Income and resource standards and methodologies for determining Medicaid eligibility are not more restrictive than those applied as of June 1, 1997. (Section 2105 (d)(1)) (42 CFR 457.622(b )(5)) Medicaid eligibility is determined by DWSS eligibility specialists and is in compliance with Federal standards. 8.8.5. No funds provided under this title or coverage funded by this title will include coverage of abortion except if necessary to sav e the life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the resul t of an act of rape or incest. (Section 2105 (c)(7)(B)) (42 CFR 457.475) Effective Date: September 115 Approval Date: ___________ The DHCFP assures that abortion coverage is only that which complies with the rules set forth in the citations listed above. 8.8.6.

Include details on the planned use of funds and sources of the non -Federal share of plan expenditures. (Section 2107(d)) A suggested financial form for the budget is attached. The budget must describe: Planned use of funds, including: 1. Projected amount to be spent on health services. 2. Projected amount to be spent on administrative costs, such as: outreach, child health initiatives, an evaluation; and 3. Assumptions on which the budget is based , including cost per child and expected enrollment. Projected sources of non -federal plan expenditures, including any requirements for cost sharing by enrollees. In July 2004, Nevada Check Up discontinued the practice of provisional enrollment. Although th e actual impact is unknown, it appears to be budget neutral. The budget for the Nevada Check Up program is included below for Federal Fiscal Years (FFY) 2003 and 2004.
