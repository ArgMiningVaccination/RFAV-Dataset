It goes without saying that to make life altering choices when you are deeply thrown is difficult. One's usual capacities are shaken and at times unavailable. Yet oddly, in just such a time, new capacities and resources can be revealed. The usual structures of thought and feeling can be more porous and fresh possibilities can enter. The first diagnosis, which I received about four years ago, was prostate cancer. This was determined not only by a blood test but also through a biopsy of the organ. I was completely surprised, as I was relatively young for such a diagnosis (56). I also prided myself on living a healthy lifestyle. Regular exercise, good nutrition, spiritual practice, and a healthy balance of work and rest did not make me immune to this occurrence. My urologist strongly recommended a radical prostatectomy. This is the surgical removal of the prostate; major surgery that can have very challenging side effects, including incontinence and impotence. I made it a part-time job to explore the literature on the disease and treatment options. I also decided to get other opinions. All told, I consulted five different medical specialists to ascertain my options. I visited a well-known specialist in treating this condition without surgery. He recommended radiation, which basically destroys the prostate without the vagaries of surgery. Yet this method also has its own possible deleterious side effects. I visited the doctor at the University of Michigan who is most recognized in the approach of \"watchful waiting,\" which is the idea of not intervening surgically or radiologically, but to keep a close eye on the cancer, as it may be slow growing and not need any treatment. Even he recommended surgery or radiation, as I was so young and would tolerate the treatment better and the cancer could possibly be more aggressive. This perspective was compelling to me, as he was the expert in this option of watchful waiting or active surveillance. I decided to go ahead with conventional treatment and chose radiation. I was configured for the procedure, an experience very similar to the procedure itself, which was scheduled in one month's time. I was ready and set to follow this protocol. At the same time, I was exploring alternative methodologies. I prayed to be guided to whoever might be able to help me. I saw a number of well-regarded energy healers; intensified my nutritional regimen; increased my psychotherapy sessions; and had a Native American medicine pipe healing ceremony. A number of other practitioners were recommended to me, but in meditation I didn't feel a resonance. I learned to listen and respect my guidance. I went to whomever the guidance directed, no matter how outside my paradigm, and I declined whomever my guidance directed, no matter how highly recommended.A significant and profound realization came to me in the midst of the Native American healing ceremony. It was augmented in my psychotherapy. I could surrender to whatever was being asked, even if that meant my death. I saw that healing does not have a particular outcome and may not mean a \"cure.\" I understood that the desire for a cure can be an egoic impulse to remove a symptom so as to feel better, which is certainly understandable, yet quite different than a healing. A healing is a deep surrender to what is; an opening and inquiry into what may be out of balance and the willingness to pay the price to re-establish this balance no matter how uncomfortable. I came face to face with my fear of dying. I embraced it in such a way that it didn't have control over me in that moment of my journey. I was released from my decision being shaped by fear. I didn't want to die; in fact, the crisis activated strong impulses to live more fully. Yet, if this was what was being asked, I could yield. A background to this exploration was the fact that my brother also had prostate cancer. He'd had surgery and it did not abate the cancer. He was slowly slipping away. So the reality of this disease and its toll was never far from my awareness. One morning in the few weeks before my radiation and shortly after the healing ceremony, I had a meditation that clearly indicated something had shifted and that I should get another blood test and reconsider my treatment. I questioned this, as it seemed so predictable for someone in my situation to deny and avoid the upcoming trauma and discomfort. I was hesitant to ask my urologist for another blood test because he might also suspect my motives. To his credit, he listened and agreed. The blood test came back dramatically different. The blood values were now in the low normal range. The urologist was surprised. I called and canceled my radiation. The radiologist was taken aback and said I was making a big mistake \u2014 \"You will be back in a year, only worse off!\" This was challenging to hear; yet I felt the rightness of my decision. It wasn't made from fear. I was willing to undergo the treatment. I was willing to meet whatever might come my way. I was also willing to trust my own inner authority. This took some fortifying, as I had to contend with all these doctors urging me to pursue conventional notions of treatment. (In the past few years since my diagnosis, medical opinion is evolving around the recommendations of testing and treatment for prostate cancer.) It has now been four years and my tests numbers have bounded around some yet remained in the normal range. I'm aware that these numbers may change again. If so, I'm open to considering conventional treatment. This may be exactly the healing agent that I require. In the fall of 2011, another medical challenge occurred. I had sharp stabbing pains in my gut that led to a diagnosis of diverticulitis. A C.T. scan confirmed this. Once again the resounding chorus of conventional opinion was to have surgery to remove the diseased sigmoid colon, which is about 18 inches long and no small matter. This had been my fourth attack in the last year. The conventional recommendation is to remove the sigmoid after two severe bouts. The science of this disease seemed to me more established than that of the prostate. There were not competing medical specialists vying for their prescribed methods, as there were with prostate treatment, so I didn't seek a second medical opinion. Also the pain was quite palpable, unlike with prostate cancer, where there are no symptoms. Yet, I also wanted to check in with alternative treatments. I made the rounds again of energy healers and alternative practitioners. Some were convinced I could use herbs or healing to treat this condition. Some were neutral. One told me during the consultation that any surgical invasion of the body was counter productive Threading the Eye of the Needle ~ Navigating Through the World of Conventional and Alternative Medicine By Brian O'Donnell Regular exercise, good nutrition, spiritual practice, and a healthy balance of work and rest did not make me immune to this occurrence. I learned to listen and respect my guidance. I went to whomever the guidance directed, no matter how outside my paradigm, and I declined whomever my guidance directed, no matter how highly recommended.I saw that healing does not have a particular outcome and may not mean a \"cure. \" ...I had a meditation that clearly indicated something had shifted and that I should get another blood test and reconsider my treatment.... The blood test came back dramatically different. The blood values were now in the low normal range. The urologist was surprised. I felt so grateful, as this was the only practitioner, alternative or conventional, to admit a bias and to look beyond it.\u00a9 2001 Karen WooThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 9 \u2014 only a few minutes later catching herself and admitting this was her bias. She asked inside herself again and came back and said that surgery might be helpful. I felt so grateful, as this was the only practitioner, alternative or conventional, to admit a bias and to look beyond it. Another alternative practitioner told me in a detached manner that he detected liver cancer while scanning me. I had mentioned that the C.T. scan had revealed lesions on my liver. He suggested that I not go for a scheduled M.R.I. to further discern the nature of these lesions; instead I should do more treatments with him. \"The M.R.I. will only confirm the cancer and they will urge you to treat it medically when I can treat it this alternative way.\" I was completely undone with his diagnosis and his clinical manner of delivering such devastating news. I spent several days believing I was going to die. Again I was called to my inner authority. When I quieted myself enough to listen to my inner voice, I decided to go ahead with the M.R.I. It revealed, after painstaking days of waiting and numerous missed calls from the lab, that the lesions were benign cysts and needed no treatment. I chose the sigmoid surgery. I had a skillful and compassionate surgeon. The surgery was strong medicine indeed. One year has passed and there are scant traces left of this treatment. I had it done robotically, and so the scars are almost invisible. I am in better shape than I have been in years, as I was suffering with a diseased bowel and didn't know it. What did I learn from these medical challenges? I learned that both conventional and alternative methods have their place. Each practitioner, with his or her particular worldview, can be both helpful and blinded by strengths and prejudices. This commitment to their structure of understanding can allow for depth of learning and practice, yet it can obscure other equally valid yet unknown perspectives. I learned that disease can be a doorway to awaken inner authority. It can also lead to submission to the egoic forces of fear and the need for certainty. When we feel shaken and unsure the temptation is to turn ourselves over to the \"experts.\" The true expert lives within us and can guide us uniquely in every situation and decision. The essential point for me was to turn within and trust my own inner \"doctor.\" Of course, this can be easily misunderstood and misused to rationalize a fear-based decision. The price to pay for trusting this inner knowing is that I had to open to any course of treatment, alternative or conventional, before I could truly hear what my guidance was leading me to. If I could accept something beyond my preference, I could more faithfully trust what the deeper intelligence was revealing. If I could relax my grasping and aversion, which is no easy task, especially when it is life and death, I could open to the medicine of the soul.

One of Ari's friends, three-year-old Eli, joined the conversation periodically as he explored the recycle bins and reported his findings to us. Deborah Bayer: Readers who know your writing from Zingerman's newsletter and your books about food and business might be surprised by your new title: A Lapsed Anarchist's Approach to Managing Ourselves, the third book in your Zingerman's Guide to Good Leading series. Ari Weinzweig: People are frequently surprised about what we do at Zingerman's. One of the biggest reasons why we're still here today and doing interesting things is because we work so hard at learning how to manage ourselves better. If you have to pick one thing, it's probably the most important because if we don't do that, the rest of it is unstable. Deborah Bayer: So, it's foundational. Ari Weinzweig: Yes, totally. If your vision is to have a rewarding, productive, and positive life, as it is for us as individuals and also for us as an organization, it requires self-awareness, reflection, learning how to breathe. Everybody here is part of what we do, and we have 600 people. DB: A key part of your personal growth over the years has been journaling. I sense that it's a contemplative practice for you. You say, \"For the cost of a pad of paper and a pen, it's perhaps the best investment I've ever made.\" AW: I just did it this morning. I almost never miss. I started journaling at a time when I was struggling personally, and someone suggested I do it to get my act together, and it was hugely helpful. In the beginning, it allowed me to get stuff out of my brain and get past the rumination. In one's head, it's very easy to repeat the same worry over and over again. Journaling put an end to that. It pushed me past the initial blocking thoughts, which aren't helpful, to get into other things. It helped me to learn about self-talk. I learned how much difference it makes to be respectful of one's self. If you aren't mindful of your internal dialogue, and you are raised, as most people are, to be fairly self-critical and not respectful of yourself internally, then it's manifested in doing the opposite in the external world by over-compensating. If I would say something harsh, it was on paper, and I could catch it. The words \"can't,\" \"have to,\" and \"should\" are so limiting to our self-liberation. When they would come out on paper, it was easier to capture it. Now a lot of that has passed, but the regimen of journaling is really helpful because it helps get my mind cleared and centered for the day. Even if there are no brilliant thoughts that come out, it's still a really grounding exercise. DB: Some people love the idea of journaling but struggle with the commitment. What are your thoughts about this? AW: It's not just journaling that people start but don't stick with. When people take something on because they think they should do it, it's externally focused and rarely works. My essay on free choice is about choosing to do something because you believe in it and want to do it. Then, it's a totally different thing. We use the visioning process at Zingerman's. There's an essay on personal visioning in the new book, and four others on visioning for organizations in Part I. If people write a descriptive, emotionally engaging vision about how their journaling will go, and they share that with a few key people in their life, then the odds of it happening are radically increased. Journaling is not a hard thing to do \u2014 it's much easier than, say, slicing smoked salmon. All \"In one's head, it's very easy to repeat the same worry over and over again. Journaling put an end to that.\" you need is a pen and paper or a computer. There's the \"ten thousand hours of practice\" idea from Malcolm Gladwell from his book Outliers in which he says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. I'm probably getting close to 10,000 hours of journaling over the past 25 years. At first it felt silly and unnatural, but it becomes natural. DB: I'm interested in the barriers we come up against even when we truly long to do something. How can we be patient during a period of resistance and have faith to proceed through the \"I don't enjoy this\" phase? AW: Anything great takes a long time. It's hard to parse that in a world where people are trained to expect fairly quick, if not immediate, gratification. It's uncomfortable to embrace something new. All great things start with discomfort. If you don't have a vision and an understanding that it's going to take time, it's totally natural to want to bail. Running is a good metaphor for that. Early on, I decided when I run to end where I start. I almost always do that. For me, it created an internal regimen around getting through resistance. Part of running is you always want to stop, especially in the beginning. You learn that if you keep going, it will be good, like most things in life. DB: Thank you, Ari. As I stood to leave, Ari was smiling and handed me a business card \u2014 not his. The card, featuring a white unicorn, is one he had made for Eli's six-year-old sister, Maia. Look for her column \"Hey Kids\" in the Zingerman's newsletter. \"People are frequently surprised about what we do at Zingerman's. One of the biggest reasons why we're still here today and doing interesting things is because we work so hard at learning how to manage ourselves better.\" \"I'm probably getting close to 10,000 hours of journaling over the past 25 years.\"A CONVERSATION WITH ARI WEINZWEIG ABOUT JOURNALINGThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 11 An Excerpt from A Lapsed Anarchist's Approach to Managing Ourselves Although I wasn't at all ready to hear it at first, I now resonate fully with what Ram Das (his real name was Richard Alpert) suggests: \"There's a way of surfing the silence, the outside silence.... So why don't you join me, and surf right into the deepest space within you, which is silent awareness.\" I write down everything, from new ideas, to complaints I would never voice aloud about customers or coworkers (no, not about you!), to descriptions of the antique salt-and-pepper-shakers that are on display at the Roadhouse, or the great service work of someone new working the counter at the Bakehouse. Other times it's about the weather, the way the wind is blowing, or the music that's playing. It might be memories of my mother, frustrations over perceived failures, high hopes for a positive future. Sometimes it's just a long string of swear words. When I don't know what to write, sometimes I just run my mind through the exercise of noticing all the subtleties around me and inside my mind. The point of it all is to see how I'm feeling before I enter the fray that we leaders live in most of the time. Journaling can help reverse the negative flow \u2014 it's good for me to get the stress out of my head and into the world where I can work with it much more effectively. The process helps me keep any crabbiness that might have crept into my mind away from customers and coworkers where it can cause serious damage in a matter of seconds. To keep the momentum going in the right direction, I regularly push myself to find the positives when I write. I use journaling to train myself to think about things I haven't appreciated of late \u2014 people, products, purveyors, even posters and art work. Two or three minutes of musing on the good things all around me is pretty much guaranteed to get me in a better mood! Fortunately I've never had to go long stretches without journaling the way I did with the running when I had the piriformis syndrome. But I know reflective writing works because on the odd day that I miss it, my mind is notably off kilter. It's so helpful to me that I will generally get up at an even earlier than early hour to do it if I know that time will be tight. Journaling each morning gives me a good runway to effectively take off for the day's work. If I'm feeling frustrated, it's good to know that beforehand so that I don't get overly reactive. If I'm feeling low energy, I have time to figure out how to rev myself up before I get too far into the day. It does pretty much the same thing for my management performance as stretching before I run does for my muscles. Loosens me up, reduces the tension, brings a bit more resilience, improves performance and reduces end of the day pain.

Molly Jarin, a long-time licensed physical therapist with a holistic approach, has added a new concept to her practice: The Pocket Gym at Aprill Wellness Center. The Pocket Gym is Jarin's answer to a great need for exercise education. In part, the gym is what she calls a \"physical therapy maintenance program\" for folks who are done with physical therapy but would benefit from continued and additional exercise to help maintain their structural health. It is also a place for those who do not need physical therapy but do need to begin an exercise program to maintain and improve their health and aren't sure where to start. Jarin teaches in a small group setting. Her goal is to help participants learn enough to feel confident in independently continuing their exercise plans. A client might sign up for 10 or 20 sessions, during which Jarin will help him or her learn how to set up exercise machines; establish good body form to prevent injury and improve strength; and learn how to slow down and listen to the body. Many people begin an exercise program with fears about their body; Jarin helps them move through the fear to a This ongoing column features upcoming events within Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County and surrounding areas' Body/Mind/Spirit communities, new (during the past year or two) practitioners and holistic businesses, new books written by local/regional authors, new classes, as well as new offerings by established practitioners and holistic businesses.

The group will take place on Friday, January 24 and Friday, January 31 from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at the Ann Arbor Women Artists group space. Ozer says that she and Tapley are both psychotherapists with a similarly unusual background in sensorimotor psychotherapy and Gestalt psychology. The group will have a holistic focus, combining discussion, art therapy, and sensorimotor techniques to \"access all aspects of experience: body, emotion, mind, and spirit.\" Ozer explains that the group will ideally have eight to ten members who are experiencing transitions such as marriage, divorce, new babies, job loss, and others. Ann Arbor Women Artists is located at 4844 Jackson Road, Suite 100, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103. For details, contact Sibel Ozer at (303) 905-1109 or email he-artspace@hotmail.com. Nature and Nurture, L.L.C., is launching Nature and Nurture Seeds \u2014 a new aspect of its business that will specialize in organic, heirloom, locally grown, and Great Lakes regionally-adapted vegetable varieties. Erica Kempter, who co-owns the business with Mike Levine, says that she has spent the last five years intensively learning about seeds. Citing interest in the Slow Food movement, an international movement that seeks to preserve traditional foods and ways of preparing foods that are otherwise disappearing in our fast food culture, she explains that she has become passionate about producing seeds. She says that she would like Nature and Nurture Seeds to help serve as a catalyst for the Midwest to become a place where seeds are produced, explaining that currently most farmers and gardeners buy their seeds at a great expense from outside of the country. She says quality seed production is \"becoming a lost art and knowledge.\" Nature and Nurture, L.L.C., is launching Nature and Nurture Seeds \u2014 a new aspect of its business that will specialize in organic, heirloom, locally grown, and Great Lakes regionally-adapted vegetable varieties.What's New in the Community By Lynda Gronlund Sibel Ozer and Barbara Tapley have teamed up to offer a new group therapy experience for women who are in different life transitions. Molly Jarin, a long-time licensed physical therapist with a holistic approach to her work, has added a new concept to her practice: The Pocket Gym at Aprill Wellness Center.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 12Photo by Joni Strickfadenplace of knowledge and empowerment. The emphasis is on overall wellbeing, and Jarin complements the exercise education with healthy food classes in the kitchen next to the Pocket Gym area, where, for example, she might teach a client how to make a healthy smoothie after a workout. She emphasizes that the gym is a supportive place, and the gym's kangaroo mascot symbolizes such an environment. Jarin says the kangaroo represents nurturing aspects with the marsupial's pouch, movement into the world with the powerful strength of the legs, and balance with the tail. Jarin offers an initial screening for potential clients. She evaluates any need for physical therapy and performs gait screenings, which help identify joint injuries. Depending on individual needs, a client may then become a physical therapy patient or might sign up for Pocket Gym instruction. Once the client feels confident in his or her exercise program, he or she may come back for \"tune-ups\" occasionally and keep in touch with Jarin through phone and email when guidance is needed. The Pocket Gym is located in the Aprill Wellness Center at 107 Aprill Drive, Suite 4, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103. Molly Jarin can be reached by phone at (734) 222-7010.

A team of local artists, musicians, and other creative folks called The Yellow Barn Collective is now running and organizing The Yellow Barn in downtown Ann Arbor, a longstanding community art and music venue, which was recently going to close. The Yellow Barn is located at 416 West Huron, just west of the railroad overpass and across Huron from the YMCA. After a change in ownership and threat of redevelopment into office space, the group took over in September in order to preserve a much-loved \"collective space for creativity and community building\" and to provide a thriving Community Supported Culture (CSC) art space. Since September, the Barn has hosted over 130 shows and will continue to offer a space for music, art, spoken word, and other creative and community-building endeavors. Alexander Weinstein, a coordinator, says that the space is available to teachers looking for an affordable place to hold classes. Current class offerings include yoga and other movement practices, whole food nutrition, and visual arts. The space hosts community jams and potlucks and is also available to local musicians looking for a place to offer concerts and writers wanting to hold fiction or poetry readings. The Barn has room for about 150 people. Tickets are sold for individual events, but frequent visitors can purchase a \"Yellow Card\" on a sliding scale from $200 to $500 for a year-long supporting membership. Card holders receive free admittance into concerts and performances, half-price classes, and 50 percent off space reservation for classes and events. Work/trade discounts are offered to make the Yellow Card available to those experiencing economic hardships. Events and information about the Yellow Barn are online at www.ouryellowbarn.com, and questions can be directed to theyellowbarn@gmail.com. After a breast cancer diagnosis in 2012, local holistic practitioner Mariah Newborne became certified as a health and wellness coach and is now offering coaching for breast cancer support and recovery. Drawing from her own experience of treating cancer holistically, she provides education and guidance in detoxification, nutrition, and juicing, as well as energy therapy (Newborne is a Reiki Master). She explains that her coaching is designed for the layperson, and is meant to be something one can Continued on page 14The Yellow Barn Collective took over in September in order to preserve a much-loved \"collective space for creativity and community building.\" After a breast cancer diagnosis in 2012, local holistic practitioner Mariah Newborne became certified as a health and wellness coach and is now offering coaching for breast cancer support and recovery.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 13 Two World TrainersTwo Certifications Ann ArborJan/Feb 2014KEVIN LAYE WITH RONALD RUDEN THOUGHT FIELD THERAPY (PTFT) WITH KEVIN LAYE 3-DAY INTENSIVE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION Jan 31 Feb 2, 2014 Kevin Laye, UK master trainer in many psychological disciplines, has chosen the most rapid and effective set of techniques from a vast array at his disposal.

HAVENING TECHNIQUES WITH KEVIN LAYE AND RONALD RUDEN M.D., PH.D. 2-DAY INTENSIVE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION Feb 8-9, 2014 Kevin Laye is joined by Dr. Ronald Ruden, developer of Havening Techniques,for this training event. Havening is a method designed to change the brain to de-traumatize the memory and PERMANENTLY REMOVE the negative effects from both our psyche and body. As part of its protocol the Havening Technique uses the sensory input of human touch as a therapeutic tool called HAVENING TOUCH \u00ae. For more information please visit: KevinLayeUSA.com or Havening.org or call 734-417-3884In the last year and a half, local holistic practitioner Christine Fodor has pursued and received certification in two new areas and has changed her business name to Renewal Clearing & Healing. She is now a certified ThetaHealer in basic and advanced DNA, and a certified facilitator in Access Consciousness: Access Bars, meaning she can provide this type of healing to her clients as well as provide practitioner certification. Fodor has been a Reiki Master for many years and still provides Reiki healing when led to do so, but she has found what she called \"incredible tangible results\" with these two methods. ThetaHealing, she explains, is a technique that focuses on thought and prayer to clear patterns and create change on the four levels of core, gene, history, and soul. She says that ThetaHealing is best known for belief and feeling work, which empowers people to remove and replace negative emotions, feelings, and thoughts with positive, beneficial ones. Similar in its clearing and releasing of old belief systems and thought patterns, Access Bars is a touch therapy that uses 32 points on the head. Fodor compares it to \"defragging a computer\" \u2014 releasing old information so people can create new belief and behavior patterns that will serve them better. \"At worst,\" she explains, \"it feels like you've had a relaxing massage. At best, your whole life can change.\" She says that outdated personal belief systems can create physical ailments and other negative consequences, and that through both ThetaHealing and Access Bars she has seen a number of people create great positive change in their lives and bodies. Fodor offers individual clearings and healings using these techniques as well as readings, coaching, and phone sessions. She has begun offering a monthly meditation clearing and healing event in her home, where participants can enjoy a guided meditation with a group clearing and healing to help remove blocks to achieving their goals. In addition to these changes, Fodor was recently asked to start an Ann Arbor chapter of the International Association of Holistic Providers (I.A.H.P .) and is looking for members who are certified in, and practicing, holistic modalities. The group will meet monthly for mutual support, and Fodor hopes to eventually host expos and events for the community once membership levels are high enough. More information about the organization is available at www.intlahproviders.com. Renewal Clearing and Healing is online at www.accessclearing-thetahealing.com. Christine Fodor can be reached by email at info@accessclearing-thetahealing.com or by phone at (248) 444-7408. Local musician Jesse Morgan has begun offering private lessons to students of all ages with a focus on helping them find and create their own music through composition and improvisation. Morgan founded Community Records, an organization that partnered with Ozone House and other youth-focused local charities to provide opportunities for young people to participate in music and the arts. In five years, the organization staged six concerts and helped over 2,000 youth write over 70 songs about their communities. The kids visited schools, community centers, homeless shelters, businesses, and other organizations to do their work. Unfortunately, Community Records had to shut down in 2012 due to lack of funding. Morgan says he had to volunteer full time to keep the organization afloat, and that was unsustainable. Now, as a stay-at-home dad, Morgan finds teaching private lessons a rewarding and practical way to use his skills. Morgan described the setup for his lessons. There are three stations: piano, percussion, and recording. The piano station is traditional; students work on live with and relax into, instead of something extreme, as with strict special diets and detoxification methods. She says that as she began her own effort in treating cancer, she realized that \"the emotional and spiritual work was more powerful than the food.\" While Newborne chose a non-medical route in her own treatment, she will work with anyone, including those looking to supplement a medical treatment plan with a holistic one. Newborne will offer a class called Self-Care Healing Kit for the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Survivor on Saturday, April 5 from 1:00 to 6:00 p.m. She will share her own story with participants and offer instruction in a variety of self-care and health and wellness techniques. On the last Fridays of January, February, and March from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., she will host the Inspire Healing Film Festival, a series of screenings featuring different films about people who have cured themselves of cancer. Both the screenings and the class will be held at the Aprill Wellness center, where Newborne has her practice. She is also working on a one-woman show called Tumor Humors, which will combine storytelling, humor, and music to share her wisdom on the experience of cancer. Details will be available on Newborne's website as they are decided. Newborne offers a free introductory coaching consultation. She can be reached by phone at (734) 657-4652. Her website is www.cancerholisticwellness.com, and her practice is located at the Aprill Wellness Center at 107 Aprill Drive, Suite 4, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103. Massage therapist Andrea Hill recently became certified in therapeutic breathwork after training with psychotherapist, writer, and field pioneer Jim Morningstar. She is now expanding her bodywork business to include private coaching sessions and a weekly group in breathwork techniques. To reflect the expansion of services, Hill is transitioning her business name from Andrea Hill Therapeutic Massage to Body Poetry Therapies. She explains that she became interested in breathwork for herself seven years ago and that in the last year she decided to train with Morningstar in order to be able to bring the benefits to her clients. She says that she can combine breathwork with bodywork but that the coaching sessions focus on breathwork. One technique she described, circular breathing, is a fast breath with no pause between the inhalation and exhalation. \"Circular breath increases life force in the body, bringing blockages to the forefront and offering an opportunity to release them physically, emotionally, and spiritually,\" she explains. Since this type of breathing can be uncomfortable and seem strange at first, the breathwork coach helps the client get through the initial stage of discomfort until it begins to feel more natural. Hill brings a unique style to this approach, which includes toning (verbalization), affirmations, movement, and intuitive energy work. Hill's weekly group breathwork session meets on Sundays at 4:30 p.m. at the Aprill Wellness Center, in the Every Body Happy Yoga space. At $15 per session, the group experience is less expensive than individual coaching and may be a good way for those curious about therapeutic breathwork to try it out. Hill says that one-on-one coaching is tailored specifically to the individual's needs and can include simple stress reduction and body awareness techniques or a full circular breath session. In addition to her new coaching and group offerings, Hill will also soon begin teaching as a local satellite instructor for Morningstar's Therapeutic Breathwork organization. More information is available on Hill's website at www. andreahilltherapeuticmassage.com and on the Body Poetry Facebook page: www.facebook.com/ahillbodypoetry.

Though the lectures are still in the planning stages, Garber says that one will feature gallery-style mediumship, in which a psychic medium will relay messages to attendees from departed friends and relatives; another will be a past-life regression session; and a third will be a presentation on trusting your intuition. The fairs have hosted a wide variety of readers: a psychic sketch artist, astrologers, mediums, tarot readers, and aura photography and interpretation, as well as different energy healing modalities: Reiki, Pranic Breath, Quantum Healing, Access Consciousness Mini Bars, and more. Garber says that the group intends to host the fairs approximately once every four months, and that they have filled a gap created when prior psychic fairs in the area stopped running. Intuitives Interactive is a group of intuitive types that meets twice monthly to socialize, offer support, exchange ideas, and present information on topics of metaphysical interest. The group is organized on Facebook and Meetup and has nearly 280 Meetup members. Garber says that bi-weekly meetings at the Deep Spring Meditation Center on Packard Road attract 30 to 45 people.

On April 7, 2014, Elevate will hold a one-day event for women of \"Generation Y\" (women in their 20's and 30's) at the Marriot in Ann Arbor. Elevate is a series of events for Generation-Y women that focuses on integrating personal and professional development, health and wellness, and philanthropy. Ann Arbor will kick off the series, and the Elevate event will also travel to New York City, Houston, San Francisco, Ashland (Oregon), Orlando, Evanston, and Birmingham, England. National and local speakers, wellness practitioners, and nonprofit organizations will gather to provide a day geared toward inspiring each participant to \"ignite her next life step.\" The series is the brainchild of Dr. Sharon Ufberg, an integrative doctor and chiropractor, writer, and activist, and her daughter Alexis Sclamberg, personal their basic instrumental skills. The percussion station allows them to work on rhythm without worrying about melody, and includes a drum pad wired to sound like a professional drum set. The recording station allows students to record songs they are working on, so they can play back and self-correct. Morgan works with experienced and beginning students alike, and says he is most interested in working with people who want to learn to make their own music. He says, \"I am the person I wish had been there to encourage me to make my own music when I was young \u2014 someone who works to understand what students have to say in their music and aids in the whole process, from initial idea to recorded and produced music.\" Morgan plays with the local kids music band The Kerfuffles and is working on recording his own first album with help from Ann Arbor-based label Oddfellow Music. Jesse Morgan can be reached at (734) 355-1501 or via email at jmorganlessons@ gmail.com. He is offering potential students a free trial lesson. The Kerfuffles are online at www.thekerfuffles.com.

The first, held in June 2013 at the Body Mind Spirit Wellness Center, featured 10 practitioners and attracted 70 attendees, extending an extra hour at the last minute due to high demand for readings and sessions. The second, held at the larger Pittsfield Grange Hall in October, hosted 20 practitioners and added 10 tables of metaphysical and holistic vendors as well as a food bar with pizza, snacks, and drinks. At 182 admissions, the number of attendees more than doubled. Of the second fair, Garber says, \"There were reports of great things that occurred, healings and synchronicity.

Abdouni says that it is designed to help participants reconstruct and activate a self-contained energy sphere, which What's New in the Community Continued from page 17 Local healthcare professional Fadia Abdouni, who describes herself as a \"natural born intuitive and medium,\" has begun teaching a course called Creating Your Personal Power Field and offering personal life coaching with an intuitive approach.allows the student to stabilize mental and emotional experienced while expanding clarity, focus, and awareness. Abdouni says that the focus of her life coaching services is on increasing one's self-awareness, explaining that while most life coaching focuses only on desired tangible results (for example losing weight), her methods help her clients to better understand themselves and the underlying problems that lead to dissatisfaction and confusion. This results in a stronger sense of self, increased confidence, and the ability to maintain desired results instead of slipping into old, destructive patterns. Abdouni will offer several free one-hour talks at the Crazy Wisdom Community Room beginning in January. Abdouni will discuss tools that participants can use immediately to help clear mental space, ground themselves, and \"quiet down the noise\" of worries and distractions. The talks will be offered from 7:00 to 8:30 p.m. on January 28, February 4 and 24, March 4 and 25, and April 22 and 29. She says that the talks are a good way for people who are curious about what she does to get an idea of how she can help. Abdouni also offers a complementary consultation for potential life coaching clients, which includes a mini coaching session. She is fluent in Portuguese and Spanish, and conversational in French and Arabic, for those who do not speak English comfortably.

It seeks to \"build the ecosystem for a new economy\" with a focus on creating wealth and sustainability in local communities. The company is a mission-driven organization and has a particular interest in working with social entrepreneurs \u2014 those who seek to impact their community positively through their business. Its newest service, launched in September 2013, is aimed at small businesses, providing a part-time contracted chief operations officer (C.O.O.) and a chief financial officer (C.F.O.) for businesses that may be as complicated as larger corporations but lack the resources to dedicate as much hands-on focused attention to their finances and operations as these positions would provide. These services go hand-in-hand with the company's Investment Readiness Assessment. Small businesses that need to raise capital from investors will need to understand what investors are looking for and be able to provide the information clearly with a business plan and other documents. Founder Angela Barbash explains that there are currently no resources for entrepreneurs in southeast Michigan to raise capital from investors (rather than the two other traditional options, which are often dead ends: banks or friends and family). Reconsider can help small businesses make themselves ready to raise capital by understanding and preparing themselves for the process. This in turn reduces the risk on the part of the investors, who may be more willing to invest locally when local businesses are well-prepared and educated. Reconsider aims to help allow capital to move more freely within communities, providing a more fertile local economy that will empower individuals and communities. Reconsider launched in 2012 and is currently located in the SPARK business incubator at 215 West Michigan Avenue, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197. More information is available at www.timetoreconsider.com. The company can be reached by phone at (734) 372-4057. ###Please note that the \"What's New\" column is part of the editorial (not paid-for advertising) part of the journal, and the editors may or may not include what you submit.

I don't feel like leaving my house to go and practice at a studio, so I've been following a lot of yoga DVDs. Lately , I find that my knees are really starting to kill. I don't have an instructor to turn to, so I'm wondering if maybe you can help. Cheers, Ray G.Ann Arbor, MI Dear Ray , I know what you mean about the weather. It's easy to get down and out, but be proud of yourself for continuing a practice instead of staying in your bed with hot cocoa! I'm sorry to hear about your knees; often the cold will exacerbate joint problems. Chances are, yours might be an easy fix. Often times when people practice at home, they forget about alignment. Check your knees in poses like utkatasana (chair pose) or virabhadrasana I & II (warriors 1 & 2). Be mindful of hyperextension. Keep your legs bent at a 90-degree angle so that your knee is directly above your ankle. There are very few exceptions to this rule. (Anjaneyasana, or crescent moon lunge, is one pose where it's okay for your knee to go beyond your toes.) If pain persists, purchase two tennis balls. Spend time massaging the outer areas of your knees. Strengthen your quadriceps and surrounding muscles to alleviate some overall discomfort. Find ways to modify your poses \u2014 if you are on all fours in cat/cow poses for a while, roll your mat under your knees to provide extra cushioning. Tailor your at-home practice for your idiosyncrasies!Namaste, Roshani, I commute 43 minutes to and from work every day . I have a job that requires me to sit for long hours in front of a computer. My lower back aches, and now my eyes are starting to hurt as well. Please help! Sandeep D.Superior Township, MI Dear Sandeep, You are not alone. Fortunately , yoga can help! For your tired eyes at work, spend two minutes each hour away from your computer. First, look up. Then look right, left, and down. Lastly , look to the upper right corner and to the upper left corner of your eyes. Hold each gaze for approximately five breaths. Carve out 20 minutes each day to help with your low-back concerns. Repeat the following sequence daily for 10 days, and you should notice a dramatic change immediately: 1. Lie on y our back with both legs extended. Draw your right knee in to your right shoulder. Hug your knee. Hold it here for 10 full breaths. Switch sides, holding the left knee for another 10 breaths. 2. Bend y our legs at the knees, place the soles of your feet firmly on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Place your palms adjacent to your hips. Engage your glutes and your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine. As you inhale, lift your pelvic area as high as you can. Hold it here for 5 breaths, working your way up each day until you can stay for 10 breaths. As you exhale, relax and release while coming back down, and melt your low back into the ground. 3. Dr aw both of your knees to your chest. Hug your knees and sway gently from side to side. This will offer your low-back a nice massage. 4. R epeat the first 3 steps for 10 minutes in the morning, and also 10 minutes in the evening.Namaste, Roshani, I have been practicing yoga pretty regularly for the past three and a half years. Now I'd like to teach yoga myself. I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for finding a good teacher's training program. Thanks in advance, Carly S.Ann Arbor, MI Dear Carly , Congratulations on embarking on the yogic path for over three years now! There are many things to consider when you're thinking about becoming a teacher. First, decide whether you want to teach as a profession or a hobby . There is an important distinction between the two. If you are planning on teaching as a hobby for friends or family , you can easily find a teacher's training program in the area. If you are looking to work professionally , seek out a well-accredited training program that is registered with Yoga Alliance (YA), the largest nonprofit association representing yoga teachers, schools, and studios in the U.S. Ensure that the program meets the minimum training standards established by YA because most hiring studios and fitness facilities require you to have a certification. Many teacher training programs are led by instructors who hold no official certification, but have been practicing for a long time. Unfortunately , this will impact whether you get a paid job. Also, seek out a program with an emphasis on a style you like. If your focus is on alignment, proper form, and the use of props, Iyengar yoga may be for you. For discipline and routine using only your body and breath, Ashtanga yoga might suit your needs. Power yoga and Vinyasa flow classes offer a more contemporary approach where anything from listening to pop music to drinking wine is acceptable. With many forms to choose from, narrow your options down to match your specialty . In the meantime, familiarize yourself with basic anatomy . Many students have injuries, so learn how certain poses can impact or benefit them. As you evolve your yoga practice, stay on the mat, and journal the changes you experience, so that later you can stay relatable to your newbie students. Namaste, Roshani! Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, you'll find a variety of tips from local yoga instructor, Roshani Adhikary . Roshani Adhikary is a certified yoga instructor teaching in the Ann Arbor/Saline area. Find her on Facebook at www.facebook.com/Yogini.Roshani and send her your queries!

What follows are profiles of two interesting businesses that are thriving despite the odds. Sylvan Run Sanctuary Kathy Squiers, owner Sylvan Run Sanctuary, 1280 475-3408 ; website: sylvanrunsanctuary.com Sylvan Run Sanctuary is located on a spacious stretch of land in Chelsea, Michigan. The large home and surrounding property are perfect for various gatherings and special occasions: classes, workshops, artist retreats, weddings, ceremonies, and more. For this installment of Leaps of Faith, owner Kathy Squiers spoke with us about how Sylvan Run Sanctuary came to be \u2014 how a home she built with her husband, Bob, turned into a place for others to experience and enjoy, in solitude or in community. Questions for Kathy Squiers, owner Q. Kathy, can you tell us about Sylvan Run Sanctuary?A. Sylvan Run Sanctuary (SRS) is a gorgeous place, peaceful and inviting \u2014 a perfect place to share special celebrations and ceremonies, either in solitude or in community. Located in rural countryside, surrounded by acres of nature preserves, Sylvan Run Sanctuary is halfway between Ann Arbor and Jackson, 16 miles to each city, and only 4 minutes from historic Chelsea. Q. What motivated you to start Sylvan Run Sanctuary? A. Sylvan Run Sanctuary was conceived while \"walking the land\" the house was built on. In 2002, while we dated, Bob and I would take frequent walks through what has become the 50-acre Squiers Preserve, and we worked on creating a pond together. On one of these walks Bob asked me to marry him, and we shared visions of an elegant wedding in the open fields surrounded by the beautiful woods. This early vision is one thing that inspired the idea of sharing with others this special place for important life ceremonies.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 26 Leaps of Faith: Tales of Local BusinessesThrough the years, we worked hand-in-glove, raking fields, piling rocks, planting trees, lawns, and gardens. Whenever our children and grandchildren visited, they all shared in the pleasant rhythms of \"farm life\" with vegetable gardens, Shire horses, dogs, cats, chickens, fish, and other wildlife for whom this place is a sanctuary. In 2007, Bob and I transposed 50 acres of this beloved land into a Conservation Preserve with a public easement \"for all the grandchildren.\" In the fall of 2008, Bob and I moved into the home we had planned and built together while living in the cozy barn apartment at the front of the property. Sadly, Bob passed away in May of 2010. Grateful for such a beautiful house, I yearned to have others share this amazing place. So I started having family reunions and community events; after turning the large garage into an art studio, I started teaching art classes, and now gardening classes. Q. Tell us about the house, please. A. Accommodations include an open floor plan with gorgeous views, a large kitchen with two dining areas, a formal yet comfortable living room with cathedral ceilings, an elegant laundry/kitchenette room, a 700-square-foot art studio, a large sunny walkout basement with 12-foot-high ceilings, and another living area that includes a library, media center, 'movement' room, and a walkout to an enclosed lawn. The house has plenty of group work areas for gatherings, meetings, conferences, workshops, classes, sleep-overs, and more. SRS is really about a unique and wonderful piece of land, and the house, which seemed to build itself in anticipation for something bigger and beyond ourselves. Q. Surrounding the home, there are Chakra Gardens that visitors can walk through and enjoy. Can you explain more about them and how they came to be? A. After Bob passed away, I went to visit my family in Colorado. While walking along a mountain creek, I felt familiar sanctuary in the beauty and peace of nature. That night in a dream, I found myself \"flying\" above the Sylvan Road home Bob and I had built, and it was like I was watching an old-fashioned film, fast-forwarding in time. Two trees that we had planted were growing larger and older, and I observed seven gardens developing in a line from the top of the hill near the house, down past the tree beyond the pond. These seven gardens were in the shapes of symbols I thought There are writers who visit regularly. There have been drummers and dancers, community bonfires and picnics; there have been art classes, gardening apprenticeships, Jungian symbolism classes, group meditations, visualizations and yoga. Sylvan Run Sanctuary is really about a unique and wonderful piece of land, and the house, which seemed to build itself in anticipation for something bigger and beyond ourselves.Kathy SquiersThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 27 were used to describe the Seven Sacred Chakra Gardens of Peru, which I had just read about. After I returned home, and throughout the following year, I researched, wrote notes, sketched, and drew up plans for these seven gardens in accordance with teachings about the energy centers of the body. Q. Can you provide some examples of plants and natural materials you plan to include in each garden to symbolize the different energy centers?A. In the fourth (heart) chakra garden, I plan to plant flowers with heartfelt meanings, utilizing the \"Language of Flowers.\" The \"Language of Flowers\" refers to the common practice of using \"flower dictionaries\" that were popular in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The books ascribed certain meanings to different flowers, so that when people sent flowers, they could communicate a somewhat literal message. For instance, a red rose still means \"love and passion,\" while a white rose means \"innocent love,\" and an orange rose means \"fascination.\" Plantings around various roses will include snow-drops, which have a meaning of \"consolation and hope;\" pink carnations, which for dignity, and so on.The third chakra garden will contain a fire-pit, and the second chakra garden will have a water feature, and so on. Q. What do you hope the Chakra Gardens will provide to artists or to anyone who visits the land? A. Gardens that will stimulate the senses associated with the seven chakra energies of the body; spaces for contemplation, visualization, inspiration, and healing; places to walk and sit mindfully and meditatively; and gardens rich with meanings that encourage play and learning throughout various stages and steps in life journeys. Q. Are any artists staying at Sylvan Run Sanctuary now? A. There are writers who visit regularly. There have been drummers and dancers, community bonfires and picnics; there have been art classes, gardening apprenticeships, Jungian symbolism classes, group meditations, visualizations and yoga. Recently, there were groups taking nature walks, searching for the native \"lady-slipper\" orchids and exploring the unusual artesian spring domes. (The Squiers Preserve has several artesian springs, and they can make different landforms when they come to the surface of the earth. When they come up under peat, the water gently pushes up, creating the formation of \"peat domes.\") There was also a group of animal footprint \"trackers\" and a group celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Other artists who may be interested in workshop retreats here: scrapbookers, quilters, basket weavers, and mosaic makers. Q. You mentioned that \"in solitude, in community\" is the tagline for Sylvan Run. What are some activities you are planning that involve community? A. In order to continue developing the Chakra Gardens, SRS will be hosting periodic \"Chakra Garden Parties,\" specifically to open the fourth heart chakra garden, to install the water feature for the second chakra garden, and to help plant and maintain all of the gardens. Q. Where are you from, Kathy? How long have you lived in Chelsea? A. I was born in Bay City, Michigan (I moved a lot as my mom was a bit nomadic; Texas, Colorado, Oregon, California). I raised and \"launched\" four kids in Ann Arbor and moved to Chelsea after Bob asked me to marry him in 2002. Q. Where did you go to college and what did you study? A. I went to college in Colorado for fine arts and botany, then chemistry. I worked as an analytical chemist in Colorado, then as an environmental chemist in Michigan. I Feature continued on page 28went back to school in 1991 at U-M to study landscape architecture and botany, with a concentration in resource ecology management, to graduate in 1994. Q. You mentioned that you are a Parks Horticulturalist for the Washtenaw County Parks and Recreation Commission and that you are about to retire. How long have you worked there? A. I worked in plant greenhouses and nurseries as a landscape designer for years, and I've been with Washtenaw County Parks and Recreation Commission as Parks Horticulturalist and Gardener since 1998. Q. How did you become interested in horticulture and gardening? A. I was always a \"tree hugger,\" enthralled by \"The Standing Nations.\" I have always worked in either my own or others' gardens since I was 14. Q. Besides being a horticulturist and gardener, you are an artist as well. What type (or types) of art do you enjoy doing? A. Currently, I am painting on wood with a variety of mediums (pastels, oil and chalk, acrylic, stains, and so on), and I belong to the \"Saturday Artists\" group at the U-M Art and Architecture building. On Saturdays, hundreds of artists have been taking turns meeting in clusters of about a dozen, to teach and share what we know about art and craft to one another. Mostly, I teach basic classes regarding the elements and principles of art \u2014 line, value, texture, perspective, and so on. I have also been teaching life and \"virtual\" life drawing, composition, framing, and collage classes in the studio at Sylvan Run Sanctuary. Many of the classes I teach utilize concepts of Jungian archetypes, seen throughout one's life developmental stages. I use experiences, concepts, and symbologies of nature, dreams, archetypes, and story-telling. I am developing interdisciplinary classes and art project programs that will combine writing and collage, music and drawing, and movement and gardening. Q. Where did the name Sylvan \"Run\" Sanctuary come from? A. Bob enjoyed literally running between the barn he had here (where SRS is), and the barn where he housed cattle, over on Old US-12. His farm was called Sylvan Run Farm. This land of sanctuary and inspiration, gardens and trees, took on the name \"Sylvan Run\" partly in memory of its recent heritage. The next Chakra Garden parties are scheduled on Sundays; April 27 and May 4, 2014. To join in the community \"opening\" of the heart, second, and fifth Chakra Gardens, please call Kathy at (734)385-6560. There will be more garden parties scheduled as the seasons proceed. Whenever our children and grandchildren visited, they all shared in the pleasant rhythms of \"farm life\" with vegetable gardens, Shire horses, dogs, cats, chickens, fish, and other wildlife for whom this place is a sanctuary. Sylvan Run Sanctuary (SRS) is a gorgeous place, peaceful and inviting \u2014 a perfect place to share special celebrations and ceremonies, either in solitude or in community. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 28 Leaps of Faith: Tales of Local Businesses Feature continued from page 27 The Lunch Room Phillis Engelbert and Joel Panozzo, owners The Lunch Room, Kerrytown Market & Shops, 407 N 5th Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48104; (734) 224-8859; website: thelunchrooma2.tumblr.com The Lunch Room opened on August 6, 2013 in the Kerrytown Market and Shops. Offering an all-vegan menu with options ranging from mac and cheese to burritos, The Lunch Room presents a diverse menu for vegans and non-vegans alike. Co-owners Phillis Engelbert and Joel Panozzo, also neighbors and great friends, collaborated in 2010 and began throwing dinner parties for friends. They went on to host a series of \"pop-up\" dining events at local establishments, and then started The Lunch Room food cart in the Mark's Carts outdoor food courtyard. After two seasons there, they took an even bigger leap of faith, and opened the restaurant location, which is quickly becoming a local favorite. Panozzo, a graphic designer by background, and Engelbert, a former professional peace activist, have more in common than a love for cooking great vegan food. For this segment of Leaps of Faith, Engelbert expanded a bit more on their shared philosophy about food, work, and community.Questions for Phillis Engelbert, Co-owner Q. In explaining how the idea for The Lunch Room was conceived, you told me about the talks you and Joel had about your shared philosophy for \"what work should be.\" Can you elaborate on these initial talks and ideas that inspired you both to open the restaurant? A. W e both felt that work should be a pursuit of your interests and passions, as opposed to something you do just to get a paycheck. We also discussed how work and life should be integrated. Too often, work is something to be endured in order to make it through to the weekend, when real living is supposed to happen. Another point is the integration of the physical and intellectual at work. To be well rounded, it's important to use both sets of abilities and to exercise both the mind and the body. Q. E ven at your busiest, how do you keep a sense of joy about your work? A . Sometimes it's hard when we are at our busiest and overtired, but we try to keep things light. We joke around with customers and employees. We have a great staff. Everyone has a great sense of humor. They care for each other and do silly things like turn food into animal scenes. Everyone contributes to keeping up morale. The Lunch Room is a very personable and community-oriented place. We talk to and learn about our guests. It's a place where one can dine alone, but sit at the counter and converse with the cooks. It also helps to have a space that is clean and bright and has good music playing. We try to create an atmosphere that is comfortable and inviting. Q. How did the name \"The Lunch Room\" come about? A. The name The Lunch Room was first applied to our private group dinners we held before opening the restaurant, then to our food cart, and we kept it for the restaurant. It connotes something basic, accessible, inclusive, and fun. We developed it at the same time that we chose the five-section cafeteria tray as our logo. Q. Ha ve you always enjoyed cooking? A. Yes, since I was a teenager. But it only really developed into a passion in the last several years. Q. You said that people don't have to \"fear what they're eating\" at The Lunch Room, and that you want to serve \"nourishment\" to the people around you. The open kitchen concept also adds to the feeling of honesty surrounding your menu and preparations. Can you elaborate on this? The name \"The Lunch Room\" connotes something basic, accessible, inclusive, and fun. Ann Arborites are health conscious and open- minded, which makes it more likely for a vegan restaurant to succeed. The Lunch Room is a very personable and community- oriented place. We talk to and learn about our guests. It's a place where one can dine alone, but sit at the counter and converse with the cooks. It also helps to have a space that is clean and bright and has good music playing. We try to create an atmosphere that is comfortable and inviting.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 29 A. We only serve food that we would feel good about eating ourselves. That means lots of fresh vegetables, whole grains, little or no processed foods, fresh baked goods, no meat or dairy or high-fructose corn syrup. We are very picky about the ingredients and products we use. And with an open kitchen, customers can observe the level of cleanliness and hygienic practices we use. Q. Did living in Ann Arbor inspir e or inform your concept for the restaurant? In what ways? A. It may be possible to have a successful vegan restaurant anywhere, but Ann Arbor is one of those places that is open to alternative ideas. And vegan food certainly runs against the mainstream of American cuisine. But Ann Arborites are health conscious and open- minded, which makes it more likely for a vegan restaurant to succeed. Q. What are some guest-favorites on the menu?A. The top sellers are mac & cheese, tempeh Reuben, burritos, and Southwest salad. Now that chili is on the menu, we have a new star \u2014 a bowl of mac & cheese with chili and corn chips on top that we call the \"chilimac.\" Q. Was it hard to raise money to open The Lunch Room?A. We put some of our own money into it, got a bank loan, and had support from 100-plus people who pre-paid for food in the form of a \"meal plan.\" The meal plan concept was that people (mostly customers we had from the food cart) paid a sum up front, with the promise of receiving that amount, plus 10% in in-restaurant dollars. So, it was hard, but do-able. Q. No w that the restaurant has been open for a few months, how's it going for you economically?A. We are able to pay the bills. I hear that's pretty good for a new restaurant. ###We only serve food that we would feel good about eating ourselves.

HELLERWORK + STRUCTURAL MEDICINE -Dr. Jay Sandweiss, DO, Ann Arbor, MI.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 30 Julie Peale, age 38, owns Body Balance of Ann Arbor, LLC, where she practices a combination of Hellerwork and structural medicine in one-on-one sessions with clients. Initially on a path to become a physical therapist, Julie attained a degree in biology from Central Michigan University, but her desire to help people on a more holistic level pushed her to explore other therapy modalities. Julie lives in Ypsilanti Township with her husband, five-year-old daughter, and two-year-old son. Bill Zirinsky: Where were you raised, Julie? Tell us a bit about your childhood. Julie Peale: I grew up in the small town of Coloma, Michigan. It is near Benton Harbor and St. Joseph. Being very near Lake Michigan, I enjoyed the beach and camping in the state parks with my family and friends. The lake is something I miss greatly since moving to Ann Arbor. I didn't realize how much of a constant and calming presence it was in my life. Bill Zirinsky: At what age, and how, did you become interested in helping and healing people? Julie Peale: I remember as a young teenager I talked about wanting to go into the health profession, but I didn't know in what way. My father encouraged me to volunteer at the hospital. I participated in a variety of areas, but was particularly interested in the physical therapy department. Bill Zirinsky: You mentioned to me that your mom believed in herbal supplements, and took you and your sister to an herbalist. And then you studied with a botanist in college. What influence did that botanist have on you?Julie Peale: My final two years of college I worked as an assistant for a botany professor. We did a lot of field research and data collection, and I developed an interest in plants and nature. Also, being a professor of medicinal herbs, he encouraged me to explore the many therapeutic benefits available to us in nature. BZ: Where did you go to college, and what did you study to become? Julie: I graduated from Central Michigan University with a degree in biology/pre- physical therapy. It was during my last year of school that I started to question my path to becoming a physical therapist and wondered if I could better serve my passion by using nature's resources to help heal and renew people's lives. In addition to my developing interest in medicinal herbs, I became interested in homeopathy. I decided to take some time after college to redirect my goals by learning about other types of holistic therapies. BZ: Did you become a physical therapist? Did you practice as one? Julie: I did not become a physical therapist. It had become increasingly clear to me as I was preparing for the graduate program in physical therapy that while I was drawn to working with individuals who were experiencing some sort of pain in their bodies, I felt the environment of many physical therapy clinics was not well suited for the kind of work I wanted to do. I wanted to have more one-on-one time with the individuals and to work with them in a smaller, more private setting.BZ: Julie, you've told me that structural medicine and physical therapy is the \"magic combination\" for you, in working with people. Tell us why?Julie: Structural medicine is a unique combination of the holistic approach of Hellerwork with some of the technical tools from the physical therapy world. This allows me to treat clients with specific symptoms or problems in their body. So yes, structural medicine is a \"magic combination\" for me because it allows me to practice the type of holistic physical therapy that I was drawn to early on in my life. BZ: Structural medicine's origins are in Hellerwork, and Hellerwork's origins are in Rolfing. How did Hellerwork depart from Rolfing? And how has structural medicine built on Hellerwork? Can you explain and trace this lineage succinctly for our readers?Julie: Joseph Heller, the founder of Hellerwork, was a Rolfer for many years and worked as an instructor for Ida Rolf. He began to notice that many of his clients would return with the same postural patterns and pain, so he added in the elements of movement education and voice dialogue to help the client have a multifaceted experience. Ida Rolf did not want to teach those elements in her program. She felt that her practitioners could add them to their work outside of the Rolfing certification. Joseph Heller decided to start his own institute to teach the Hellerwork method, which includes the structural deep tissue bodywork similar to Rolfing, movement education to teach the client about their movement habits, and voice dialogue to discuss lifestyle habits and emotional mindsets that could be contributing to the client's posture. The latter two help to bring awareness to the client so he or she can make changes to reinforce the structural and postural changes achieved through the bodywork. Structural medicine took the holistic approach of Hellerwork and integrated some treatment and diagnostic tools to better equip the practitioner to work with specific conditions or symptoms that the client may be experiencing. BZ: Anne Carbone has been doing Hellerwork in the region for a long time. How did you come across her, and what influence did she have on you? Julie: It was only a few years after graduation from college, and I was pondering what direction of alternative or complementary therapies I wanted to become trained in. I was still interested in the physical therapy field, but was considering whether Interview by Bill Zirinsky Photography by Tobi Hollander An Interview with Julie Peale of Body Balance on Hellerwork and Structural Medicine Structural medicine is a \"magic combination\" for me because it allows me to practice the type of holistic physical therapy that I was drawn to early on in my life. Based on a client's symptoms, posture, and results of the range of motion testing I do, I customize a session to get to the root cause of his or her pain.Structural medicine took the holistic approach of Hellerwork and integrated some treatment and diagnostic tools to better equip the practitioner to work with specific conditions or symptoms that the client may be experiencing. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 31 massage or possibly Rolfing would allow me to work with clients in the way that I was drawn to. My brother had been working with Anne Carbone to help resolve a shoulder injury. He encouraged me to see Anne for some of my own issues stemming from a car accident that I had been in during my teens. The first session with Anne was very meaningful because, for the first time, I felt that someone had really seen me as a whole person. She saw how each pain I was feeling was related to my whole being, rather than compartmentalizing everything. My experience working with her was so positive for my own wellness and healing that I looked into what it would take for me to become a Hellerwork practitioner myself. BZ: Tell us about Donna Bajelis and how she has been integral to your path? You told me that structural medicine gives treatment tools and assessment tools to the Hellerwork practitioner. How and why?Julie: Donna Bajelis was the primary instructor of the Hellerwork training I participated in. Anne Carbone had told me that she would be a good fit for me to study under because she was a practicing physical therapist who was also a Hellerwork practitioner and had been teaching for the Hellerwork organization for over 10 years. Donna was innovative in bringing in many of the tools from the physical therapy world to the holistic approach of Hellerwork. With Joseph Heller as her close mentor and friend, she got the support to do what he himself had done with the Rolf Institute. She decided to branch out from Hellerwork and start her own institute teaching the modality of structural medicine. I feel fortunate to have been a part of her training because I had the roots of Hellerwork blended with the treatment and assessment tools from her physical therapy background. Donna continues to be a mentor for me both professionally and personally. Since my graduation from the program 10 years ago, I continue to stay involved with her institute and spend time working with her in her Seattle office. BZ: You have told me that you \"wanted the complicated issues that were failed by medicine.\" Please amplify on that. Julie: Coming from my own experience of being \"failed\" by medicine, I wanted to be a help to others in similar experiences. The tools of structural medicine give me the confidence and skills to assess the symptoms a client is experiencing. My goal is to find the source or combination of imbalances that is causing the pain. This approach of looking at the whole body as one functioning unit is a strength of Hellerwork and structural medicine. BZ: To what degree is your approach customized to each individual who comes to see you? Julie: There is a traditional Hellerwork series that is about 12 to 15 sessions that works through the entire body in a systematic way. It is a brilliant design to transform a person's structure, but I have found that many of my clients are dealing with too much pain on a daily basis to benefit from the traditional series. Based on their symptoms, posture, and results of the range of motion testing I do, I customize a session to get to the root cause of their pain. Once the client experiences the possibility for less pain in their body, then we may decide to work through the more systematic approach of the Hellerwork series. BZ: Can you make a stab at describing a typical session? Are your clients lying down, sitting up, or standing, or what? Julie: A session usually lasts 90 minutes. I do a postural assessment and some range of motion testing to determine what is the best way to proceed, but most of the time is spent doing the hands on deep tissue bodywork. Typically, the client is lying down on the table, but there are times when I may do some of the treatment with them sitting or even standing. I use pillows and blankets to prop them in a position where they feel the most comfort and ease to allow the bodywork to be most effective. BZ: How is your work different from massage? Julie: While the treatment can be relaxing, this is not the primary goal of the session. The intention is to make long-term structural changes that can be felt in the body. Rather than a general head to toe treatment, each session works in a specific area of the body that is holding tension or is responsible for pulling alignment out of place. This is not a passive experience for the client. It is an interactive process where the client may be propped in certain positions, asked to concentrate on breathing deeply, and asked to periodically move certain muscles to facilitate the release necessary to achieve the structural change. BZ: Can you share some anecdotes of your working with specific issues. Julie: I have worked with individuals with issues ranging from chronic back pain to acute disc problems who have found relief. Runners have reported being able to train harder and faster for competitions without pain. This work has been helpful for individuals with hip and knee replacements to help restore flexibility and recovery. In other scenarios, this can help put off the need for surgery and, in some cases, clients have not needed to have surgery at all. For some individuals, the work is more emotional in nature. The reduction of stress and tension in their body opens up a conversation about possible changes to make in their personal life to improve their overall well-being.I had a memorable experience with a client who came to me with severe sciatica and muscle spasms in his hip. He was to the point of being in constant pain and was no longer able to enjoy his work or hobbies of fishing and motorcycle riding. After two sessions with me, he was 90 percent pain-free and able to enjoy his daily responsibilities and hobbies again. To be able to improve someone's quality of life to that degree was particularly rewarding and reinforced my commitment to continuing this work. BZ: You like to help your clients bring awareness to how they feel \"before and after.\" Please expand on that. Julie: I always like to have the client do some sort of movement before we begin the bodywork, whether it be walking around the room, sitting or standing with awareness of their posture. Throughout the session and at the end, I like to have them feel how things may be different. I want to bring awareness to how the structural changes that have occurred during the session will change the way they move in their bodies. I find this helps them retain the changes even if it is from the memory of how they felt \"before.\" BZ: What other modalities have you worked with, and are you working with? Julie: I have integrated the use of essential oils into my practice. I have found some oils to be beneficial in releasing muscular tension and relieving inflammation. I have also enjoyed teaching workshops about the everyday use of essential oils in our life. I am currently working on a side project of developing a line of therapeutic creams and sprays made with essential oils as the active ingredients. BZ: Please tell us a bit about your family. Julie: I have been married to a supportive and wonderful husband for 15 years. We have two delightful children, a 5-year-old daughter and 18-month-old son. We live in Ypsilanti Township with our two yellow labs and a petite and affectionate kitty. In the summers, we enjoy gardening, camping, bonfires, and being outdoors. This fall we are making a big shift as a family as our daughter starts kindergarten. Julie Peale can be contacted at julie@bodybalance4u.net or at (734) 395- 6776. Body Balance is located at 708 W.

Ann Arbor Dance Works was founded by members of the University of Michigan dance faculty. The company's dancers are faculty members, guest artists, and select graduate and undergraduate dance students. People Dancing was founded by Whitley Setrakian Hill, who led the group until 1999, when she moved to Nashville and passed the baton to Christina Sears-Etter. Sears-Etter had danced with Hill and with Ann Arbor Dance Works. People Dancing is committed to serving the community, which it does by offering classes, lectures, and workshops. It aims to \"enrich lives through the art and practice of dance\" and to build bridges between the worlds of art and education. The group's mission includes bringing dance into the community and making high-quality programming accessible to the widest possible audience. Christina Sears-Etter and People Dancing \u2014 Connecting Hearts Through the Arts By Rachel Urist Photos by Edda PacificoPeople Dancing is committed to serving the community. It aims to \"enrich lives through the art and practice of dance.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 33 Each spring, the company performs in \"Dance in the Mitten,\" a concert held, in recent years, at the Riverside Arts Center in Ypsilanti. (\"Mitten\" refers to Michigan's distinctive shape.) Various Michigan dance companies are represented in the event. The groups differ in composition and flavor, but they are alike in their passion for dance. Last May, dancers varied in size and shape from one troupe to the next, but each performer was flexible and sure. Quickness of movement was the rule. Even those who prefer Balanchine bodies \u2014 tall and willowy \u2014 had to admire the skill and versatility of these fluid dancers. The choreographers' inventiveness was equally arresting. Two months before the concert, I attended a studio rehearsal of Sears-Etter's dance-in-progress. As I watched her dancers' individual warm-ups, which included various yoga poses (downward facing dog, boat, three-legged dog) it became clear that these dancers were seasoned yogis. One is a licensed yoga teacher. Sears-Etter herself has practiced yoga for twenty years and is training to become a certified instructor. For these dancers, however, yoga is a stepping stone to a higher calling: dance. For them, dance is the spiritual guide, a path to mindful living. They embody the People Dancing motto: \"Connecting hearts through the arts.\" Had I not met Sears-Etter just before the rehearsal, I would not have guessed that she was the senior member of the group and its director. She could pass as sister to any of the dancers, even though their ages range from 15 to 30. Sears-Etter's lithe, muscular, and graceful body, her high energy, ready smile, and penchant for gathering her dancers in group hugs (\"Let's have some sugar\"), belie her 43 years. She is mother and friend to her dancers. They communicate in several dance vernaculars. She uses ballet terms: \"rond de jambe\" and your timing,\" and \"show the struggle\" in experimenting with movement. She composes appealing stage pictures with her dancers' bodies. Whether still or moving, the tableaux are pleasing. It was a treat to watch the rehearsal, which was part of a series of choreographic exercises for Strive, a work inspired by the study of mirror neurons. Sears-Etter, always curious about the world, was taken with the theory that mirroring \u2014 reflexive mimicry of one another's facial expressions, gestures, and sounds \u2014 offers clues to the roots of empathy and compassion. When she decided to explore this phenomenon in art, she spent time discussing the idea of mirror neurons with her dancers. Since chimps were involved in a recent study of mirror neurons, and since many scientists suspected that this mirroring offered proof that the brain is hard-wired for empathy, a poster for the dance project featured a photo of primatologist Jane Goodall with a chimp. Strive was one of two pieces presented by People Dancing . The other was Cenote at Dusk, a solo work performed by Sears-Etter and her frequent musical collaborator, Ken Kozora, on guitar and percussion. Strive featured five company dancers in an abstract piece, with movements mirrored by pairs of dancers. Sears-Etter's solo piece, Cenote , was inspired by flamenco and tap, and was a dialogue between dancer and musician. Ken Kozora described their improvisational way of working. He said that Sears- Etter likes to leave sections of the dance unscripted. During those sections, he and Sears-Etter communicate with each other onstage, and the dance and music evolve spontaneously, before our eyes. At this concert, their artistic dialogue was effective and affecting. Sears-Etter's costume evoked traditional flamenco finery, with jingling metal mesh around her midsection, and flesh-colored tap shoes that showed off her footwork. Her tapping was often accompanied by her hands clapping, answered by Ken's percussive tapping on guitar. Sears-Etter's hair was pulled back, with a flower over one ear. She looked the part of a Spanish femme fatale. But it was all fa\u00e7ade. Her seductive mien was leavened by a playful sense of mischief. After all, the concert was a family affair. All three of her children were in the audience. Sears-Etter's eldest daughter, 19, had just returned home after her first year of college. The other two, a son and daughter, ages 14 and 9, manned the table, taking and selling tickets before the show. They were happy to help. Her husband was also on hand. Sears-Etter's family has always been supportive. Eight years ago, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her youngest was nine months old. The episode was seismic. Sears-Etter underwent surgery and radiation and recovered completely, but the illness changed her life. She values her time differently. \"I'd been hard driving,\" she recalled. \"I took my strength for granted. But mind-body balance is important. I make time to take care of myself. I don't have a magic recipe for balance, but I try. I no longer put art above everything.\" Being a cancer survivor has helped her see that enjoying life is as important as achieving one's goals. She recognizes that, for some women, the choice to put their careers on hold while raising children makes sense. But it is not her choice. \"I'm a better person as a working artist than I am without that part of me being engaged. It takes a lot of energy, but I'm happier and more productive with art being such a big part of my life.\" She added: \"As I get older, I find I need more inward time to warm up and prepare. No matter how early I get to the theatre, there are distractions \u2014 things and people \u2014 that need my attention. I really like being in pieces, and I dance in a lot of works, but when I'm in charge of so many elements [administrative, technical, choreographic], it's better for me to dance in just one piece.\" The group's mission includes bringing dance into the community and making high-quality programming accessible to the widest possible audience.

At a recent presentation at Ann Arbor's District Library's main branch, Amanda Stanger Read and her husband, Scott Read, were the first performers on the program. They demonstrated the waltz, then taught it. For them, the professional melds with the personal. They are co-owners of Arts in Motion, a dance and music studio on the west side of town. The eldest of their three children has danced with Sears-Etter's company. Victoria Gilbert, relatively new to the troupe, performed in a piece called Beatnik Chicks. She is the mother of four little ones who sat with their daddy in the audience. Another new member of People Dancing is one of Sears-Etter's former students, Jessica Rose. Rose talked about the feeling of sisterhood she shares with Sears-Etter. Each lost her thyroid to cancer. Balance is key. Burn-out was one of the reasons that Hill, the company's founder, left. She was dedicated but depleted after years of pouring her energy and resources into People Dancing . For Sears-Etter, running the company is one of several tasks she juggles. She teaches dance part-time at Wayne State University and at Arts in Motion, on Jackson Road. At Wayne, she teaches dance history as well as movement. She expects her students to recognize the aesthetics of the great choreographers: Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, among others. She assigns her students the task of creating dances in the style of one or another of these iconic dance figures. Her company dancers are busy, too. Some are students. Some are teachers, some earn their livings doing odd jobs. All are required to take regular technique class, although they can do that at any number of studios. Some do ballet, others modern, or yoga, improvisation, or personal training. Like Sears-Etter, company dancers find their calling in dance. They feed one another's \"art habit,\" as Sears-Etter calls it, with mutual love and support. They are an ever-changing group, a \"pick-up company,\" which presents challenges when trying to establish a repertoire. In summer, some People Dancing's dancers go to Interlochen or Blue Lake to train. It requires that Sears-Etter be flexible both mentally and physically. Except for Sears-Etter, none of the dancers from last May's \"Dance in the Mitten\" appeared at the Ann Arbor District Library in October, when the company gave a lively demonstration and workshop. The program, entitled \"Dancing Through Time,\" featured video clips and slide-shows with images of dancers from the eighteen hundreds to today. There were also brief performance pieces, along with demonstrations and instruction in ballet, jazz, and the waltz. When the audience was not on its feet learning various dance steps, they sat in chairs arranged in a large horseshoe around the vast, carpeted center of the downtown library's multipurpose room. When Sears-Etter first came to Ann Arbor, she enrolled in the musical theatre program at the University of Michigan. Her minor was creative writing. She spent so much time at the dance department, that one day, Gay Delanghe, the late, legendary U-M dance professor, said to her: \"Why not major in dance? You're always here!\" That tipped the balance. In subsequent years, Sears-Etter has taught at Eastern Michigan University, Wayne State, University of Toledo, U-M Flint, Michigan State University, Towson State, and Monroe County Community College. Her choreography has been produced widely: in New York City and environs, upstate New York, Washington, DC, Illinois, Maryland, Poland, and the U.K. Sears-Etter's colleagues have equally interesting stories. Among her fellow dance instructors at Arts in Motion, one grew up dancing with the School of American Ballet in New York City and now holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience. Another, a native of the Czech Republic, danced and toured for ten years with the Opera Ballet of the National Theatre in Prague. Scott and Amanda Stanger Read were both members of prestigious dance companies in Michigan and New York City, and last year, their eldest daughter, at 15, was the youngest member of People Dancing . She, too, has moved on.Last May, dancers varied in size and shape from one troupe to the next, but each performer was flexible and sure. Quickness of movement was the rule.

Dance has informed my journey. It allowed me to realize my destiny better.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 36 Dancer, singer, and choreographer Whitley Setrakian Hill is well known to many in Ann Arbor for her role as the founder and head of People Dancing for 14 years, as a writer for The Ann Arbor News, and also as a singer/songwriter playing places like The Ark and the Ann Arbor Summer Festival with her band, Whit Hill and the Postcards, or with her husband, Al Hill. Some may also know her as Madonna's junior year roommate, a story she tells in her 2011 memoir Not About Madonna: My Little Pre-Icon Roommate and Other Memoirs (Heliotrope Press). The memoir is largely set in Ann Arbor and describes in great detail her life as artistic director of People Dancing . Hill, now a resident of Nashville, Tennessee, returns to Ann Arbor often, a place that embraces her fondly. She is a founder and organizer of Nash Bash, a country music festival that takes place every August at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market. Hill graduated from the U-M School of Music, Theater & Dance in 1979. After a short time in her hometown of New York City, she returned to Ann Arbor to find her way in the local dance scene. She recalled the inspiration for People Dancing came after she auditioned to be the artistic director of Dance Gallery, a role that was given instead to J. Parker Copley, a choreographer who would also become a prominent figure in Ann Arbor's dance scene. Losing out on the role made her ask herself, Why wait for them? Just a few years out of school, she decided to start her own company. Soon she met Diane Rosenblatt, a woman who would become her chief administrator and would play a major role in the company's success. Together, they secured non-profit status and a board. Rosenblatt helped her win many grants. She recalled that People Dancing was one of the most well supported dance companies in Michigan in the eighties, a time when the then-Michigan Council for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts generously funded modern dance. Hill, who served as artistic director, and her dancers \"even received a salary for a couple of years,\" which is not the case for many companies. Operating mostly out of the rambling collection of studios at the Performance Network space on Washington Street (now the YMCA), People Dancing came to life under Hill's direction. She said it was easy to find dancers, that she was happy to work with dancers of all different body types, and she wanted to make it fun and inclusive. The company performed in Chicago and later in New York at the Cunningham Studio, but mostly performed locally at the Performance Network and Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre. The company made several appearances at the Ann Arbor Summer Festival. Hill noted that making a dance company last 14 years was an enormous accomplishment by a large group of people. In addition to dancers, staff, and board members, \"There were interns, volunteers, designers, photographers, cheesecake-bakers, and so many more, working together to make it happen.... Everything was accomplished without email. We had postcard stamping parties.\" It was a time in Ann Arbor when there was a large audience for modern dance, with at least four major companies performing regularly around town. Hill fondly recalled hosting a weekly open stage at the People Dancing studio called \"Fine, Be That Way.\" Every Friday, a crowd would gather; performers could try out new works in dance, music, performance art, and spoken word. After her years of leading People Dancing \u2014 and many injuries \u2014 Hill passed on the dance company to Christina Sears-Etter, in 1999. Hill continued to choreograph and perform with the company occasionally over the next years, before she moved south with her husband to pursue her music career, in 2008. Since moving, she published her memoir, teaches dance, and makes it a priority to return to Ann Arbor frequently. Asked about her time running People Dancing , she said, \"Wow, there's so much to say. I made lifelong friends and have kept in touch with most of the people who danced with me. It was an honor to work with them, and to be a part of Ann Arbor's incredible arts community.\" Whitley Setrakian Hill can be reached at: whithill@umich.edu.

What I didn't realize until recently was just how much. Like many people, I suffer from chronic health issues that traditional doctors don't seem to have the time to address, nor the interest in doing so. I thought I was taking my health into my own hands by seeking alternative health care practitioners, but found the same pressed-for-time, distant attitude that ultimately left me financially and emotionally destitute. The uphill battle of trying to be heard was downright exhausting, so a few years ago, I gave up the fight. It wasn't a conscious decision, but a slowly waning interest in a process that was failing to produce results. Fortunately, last fall, I was shaken out of my despondency through a simple truth brought to me by a good friend: \"You can overcome your health issues. You just haven't found the right doctor yet.\" I hadn't known how much faith I'd lost in medicine until I felt the impact of those words. The lack of validation and support in my medical experiences over the years had actually formed a belief within me that told me I was stuck with my health issues for life. Even more disconcerting to me than discovering this negative belief was how I had unknowingly resigned myself to it. I had actually created space in my life to accommodate these health issues because they were with me for the long haul. Absorbing my friend's words was like waking up from a long sleep and realizing that what I thought was true had all been part of a bad dream. With a renewed sense of confidence, I began doing research. This time around I decided to look specifically for a doctor specializing in women's health. I had been going to female doctors exclusively for years, and although their specialties varied, their bedside manners didn't. I hoped that a doctor dedicated to women's health might have more compassion for women's health issues. In the course of my research, I came upon a practice called WomanSafeHealth and was immediately drawn in by the name. A quick trip to womansafehealth.com and I was convinced that I found the place I had been lulled into believing did not exist. The Healing Power of the Right Relationship: How Elizabeth Shadigian, M.D., and WomanSafeHealth Are Raising the Standards for Women's Health Care I was first struck by a series of statements highlighted near the top of the home page: I welcome you I listen to you I believe you I protect your privacy I am accountable to you I respect \"no\" Further reading only heightened the sense of excitement I was beginning to feel. \"We welcome women and girls of every age and ability, size, shape, color, sexuality and identity, from all social, spiritual and cultural backgrounds...We welcome all women, including those who feel unwelcome in other medical settings and those who have experienced physical and/or sexual violence or disrespect.\" The website was a wealth of valuable information for the woman leery of the health care system.

WomanSafeHealth gets it: Health care can be cold, anxiety- forming, and sometimes even downright scary. Not only were they acknowledging these issues on their site, they were giving women free tools to help them deal with the reality of them. The space was open, peaceful, and warm with natural light coming through the front windows. It was clear that a lot of thought had been put into creating an atmosphere of calm and safety.

It also highlighted that the practice had been built using sustainable and non-toxic materials, something of great importance to me. I was delighted to find a page dedicated to health care anxiety and a series of downloadable \"Empowerment Pocket Guides\" that women (really anyone) can use for support when seeking medical help. WomanSafeHealth gets it: Health care can be cold, anxiety-forming, and sometimes even downright scary. Not only were they acknowledging these issues on their site, they were giving women free tools to help them deal with the reality of them. I was convinced I had found the right practice. I called to make an appointment and spoke with Stephanie, who introduced herself as a nurse and acupuncturist. I summarized my health concerns and she listened intently, asking questions as we spoke. She mentioned some possible causes of my health issues and said that she would be happy to schedule an appointment for me to see Dr. Shadigian, who could offer more insight about my concerns after an examination. I was grateful for Stephanie's mindful approach and pleased that she had the time to listen to me and offer feedback. Though I had only expected to make an appointment, I got off the phone feeling a sense of reassurance that I might finally receive answers to my long-standing health questions. I showed up for my appointment and was impressed to discover that the door remains locked at all times for women's safety and privacy. I rang the doorbell and Stephanie promptly came to the door and greeted me. She introduced herself and gave me a brief introduction to the space, which was open, peaceful, and warm with natural light coming through the front windows. It was clear that a lot of thought had been put into creating an atmosphere of calm and safety. I sat down on a plush couch in the waiting room and filled out paperwork, taking in the live plants and d\u00e9cor, as well as the Zen rock garden that sat on a tray in front of me. Upon finishing my paperwork, Stephanie took me into an office where she took my vitals and asked some questions. She was very excited for me to meet Dr. Shadigian and was confident I would connect with her and her client-centered approach. Moments later Dr. Shadigian came bustling in. A petite woman with long sandy brown hair and a wide smile, she introduced herself as Elizabeth Shadigian and shook my hand firmly, saying, \"You can call me Elizabeth.\" She took me into her office, which was part exam room and part consultation space. Like the waiting room, the space was warm and inviting, with soft colors on the walls, comfortable furniture, and bamboo cabinets. I sat down on the couch and Elizabeth sat opposite me in her office chair so that we were at eye level. She explained to me that she liked to sit that way to connect with her clients and put them at ease, which was definitely working on me. She then explained a little bit about her space, about the custom built cabinets and lack of plastic and her efforts to create a safe and welcoming environment for her clients. She pointed out the overstuffed exam table that looked more like a comfortable massage table and mentioned that all the towels and robes were all 100 percent cotton. She also noted the aromatherapy sprays and Bach flower remedies on the end table that are available to clients who may have anxiety about being examined. From there she proceeded to embark on our hour-long visit by asking a variety of questions about my life. In addition to asking about the health concerns that brought me in and my past health history, she asked about my occupation, my relationship with my husband and family, my eating habits, and whether I had ever been a victim of violence or abuse. The answers I gave to each question led to more questions and Elizabeth wrote notes frantically as I spoke. Throughout the visit she repeated some of my answers to confirm that she heard me correctly and nodded her head in validation of my experiences as I spoke. I was amazed at how much time Elizabeth devoted to uncovering who I am and where I am in my life. Unlike other doctors I had visited, I was the one who spoke most throughout the visit, and Elizabeth was fully engaged in what I spoke about. Exam time came near the end of the visit and Elizabeth explained to me what she would be doing and why. She asked if I had any questions about the exam and if I had any anxiety about it. She reminded me of the aromatherapy sprays and Bach flower remedies and let me know that Stephanie would also be in the room to offer support if I would like. During the exam Elizabeth was very gentle and asked questions at every stage: May I touch your leg? Are you doing ok? She was very conscious of my experience during the exam and spoke to me throughout, making me feel like I was a partner in the exam instead of an object being studied. After the exam, when I had changed back into my clothes, we sat down again and Elizabeth summarized our visit, gave feedback, and explained the various forms of treatment available, including both conventional and alternative options. When I expressed the importance of natural remedies in my care, Elizabeth honored my need and spoke of homeopathic and herbal remedies, as well bodywork such as acupuncture and massage, which are also available at her practice. She wrote down \"homework\" for me to do between then and our next visit and told me that she has helped many women overcome the issues I was dealing with and was confident that she could help me too. For the first time in a long time, I entertained the idea that I could heal from my issues and believed that Elizabeth genuinely wanted to help. Upon leaving she told me it was a pleasure meeting me. The pleasure had definitely been mine! I left the building and got in my car. The moment I closed the door I found myself overcome with emotion and began to cry. I had been brought to tears in my previous experiences with doctors, but never for reasons like this. As I sat in my car and let the tears fall down my face, I felt relief and gratitude for having found someone who finally took the time to listen. I opened my heart and let hope in, as I let it sink in that I'd finally found an ally on my healing journey. Moments later Dr. Shadigian came bustling in. A petite woman with long sandy brown hair and a wide smile, she introduced herself as Elizabeth Shadigian and shook my hand firmly, saying, \"You can call me Elizabeth.\" She was very conscious of my experience during the exam and spoke to me throughout, making me feel like I was a partner in the exam instead of an object being studied.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 40 Elizabeth Shadigian, M.D. Dr. Elizabeth Shadigian is a special kind of doctor, the kind our health care system needs more of. A feminist and activist, she is motivated by the injustices to women she has found in our health care system, and is driven to provide supportive and individualized health care to each of her clients. With a medical degree from John Hopkins University, residency and board certification in obstetrics and gynecology, and 15 years on the faculty of University of Michigan Medical School, including 12 years of caring for women, Dr. Shadigian is well acquainted with the standards and limits of our national health care system. \"In the current mainstream medical systems, health care is 'self-serving,' as opposed to serving the needs of individuals, especially the unique needs of women. Most health care professionals regularly disrespect and diminish women in deference to an employer/medical industry that has patient care last on their list of priorities, but patient numbers first,\" says Dr. Shadigian. She has dedicated her career to providing women the personal and thorough care they deserve, and since December of 2007, has been offering it through her personal practice at WomanSafeHealth. As the mother of three through home births, a victim of abuse, and a breast cancer survivor, Dr. Shadigian understands firsthand the diverse and sometimes traumatic issues women face when it comes to their bodies and their health. With a background working in traditional health care settings, she also knows what women are up against when they seek care. In fact, she's even coined a term to describe the form of health care women generally receive: SQHC: Status Quo Health Care . \"SQHC: Status Quo Health Care is a term we use regularly at WomanSafeHealth to describe current health systems and providers who are complacent in their practices, providing each woman with the same, average care while neglecting her specific needs. Most women prefer to have partners in their health care, not bullies; choices, not dictums. Each woman has a different opinion as to her best health care course and SQHC: Status Quo Health Care rewards a routinized, deaf recitation of what is best for women as a herd.\"Eril Andes is a graduate of the Ann Arbor Institute of Massage Therapy and the Polarity Center. She has been practicing therapeutic massage for more than ten years and integrates Polarity work to enhance the healing experience of her clients. Polarity Therapy uses energy techniques to balance the body and mind. Andes also specializes in recovery from trauma, and pregnancy and infant massage. Rachel Pastiva: How long have you worked at WomanSafeHealth?Eril Andes: I came into the practice at WomanSafeHealth in April of 2010, and I am continuously grateful for the opportunity to be part of focused health care for women run by women. Rachel Pastiva: What drew you to study your healing modality and what are some ways you think it is uniquely helpful to women? Eril Andes: Massage and Polarity are my calling. I love what I do, and I have always really enjoyed helping people, especially people who have certain complexities in their health care requirements. It is important to me that women are able to receive exemplary care. Rachel Pastiva: What kind of responses do you receive from new clients about the level of care they receive from you and others at the practice? Eril Andes: WomanSafeHealth provides a therapeutic massage environment for women to experience their own level of comfort in massage and Polarity therapies. My goal is to give my clients my complete presence, intention, and appropriate techniques for their specific needs. The feedback I have received has been incredibly positive. Bringing Polarity Therapy into a medical environment for trauma recovery has been the most noted in my clients. Polarity alongside massage modalities can help strengthen internal gauges and a woman's core body whether or not she has experienced trauma. Rachel Pastiva: In practicing Polarity and massage, have you learned anything about their powers to heal that has surprised you? Eril Andes: I consider myself the catalyst that helps my client's system stimulate healing and their innate healing powers when they receive my work. I am always happy to see health improvements, and yes, sometimes it's a surprise to see how much healing a client can achieve when they commit to regular massage and Polarity treatments. This is a science after all. Rachel Pastiva: What are some unique ways Polarity and massage help in the trauma recovery process? Eril Andes: Trauma recovery is a unique process to each individual. Trauma comes in different forms and dynamics vary for different individuals. Polarity Therapy allows a client to stay dressed if they wish and process verbally and be actively listened to, in addition to the hands-on work. I have seen improvements in clients by helping them reduce mental and physical stress. Feeling supported through trauma recovery is crucial to healing.

She has also been a practicing nurse for 19 years, and received her B.S.N. from the University of Michigan. She has hospital experience in critical care and cardiac nursing and now focuses on women's health. Rachel Pastiva: How long have you worked at WomanSafeHealth and how did you become involved in the practice? Stephanie Macey: I have worked at WomanSafeHealth for four years. When I moved back to Michigan from studying Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine in Chicago, I was looking for practitioners in the Ann Arbor area that shared my philosophy of combining Eastern and Western modalities of healing. Through my professional network, I met Dr. Shadigian. That ended up being a match made by my spirit guides. When I first showed up at Dr. Shadigian's practice, I had an immediate sense of calm. Dr. Shadigian came out of the office to greet me with a very warm smile and held out her hand and asked \"Have we met before?\" and I knew that this was exactly where I was supposed to be. Rachel Pastiva: What drew you to study your healing modality and what are some ways you think it is uniquely helpful to women? Stephanie Macey: I have always been interested in holistic medicine, which is why I took a path in nursing. I was a Reiki practitioner and took classes in herbal medicine, nutrition, and homeopathy. After 17 years of nursing in the hospital, I realized I wanted to know more about alternatives to Western medicine. I felt like the medical model did not always suit each person's individual needs. I feel that Chinese medicine is uniquely helpful to women because they have special hormonal issues that change across the lifespan and that respond well to energy changes. Chinese medicine is extremely helpful in balancing women's menstrual flow, anxiety, depression, and has strong effects on their fertility. It is easy to evaluate women's response to alternative medicine by evaluating their menstrual flow and fertility. It has also been helpful for women experiencing menopausal symptoms. Rachel Pastiva: In what ways have the values of the practice informed your own work? Stephanie Macey: I have had to do some \"unschooling\" from the way of providing care in the hospital setting working at WomanSafeHealth. There was rarely the time in the hospital to truly care for people. It was refreshing to come work in a space that allows the time to truly provide compassionate care. Working at WomanSafeHealth has restored my faith in humanity. There are people who really want to provide compassionate care and are finding ways to work around the hurried system of health care. I see true healing happening when the time is taken to listen to people and respect their needs. Rachel Pastiva: Do you think the level of care women receive at WomanSafeHealth transforms their beliefs about themselves or their role in their health? If so, how? Stephanie Macey: Yes, I believe women feel empowered after coming to WomanSafeHealth. We are always educating about women's rights with their bodies \u2014 providing women with options about their health care and helping them feel safe to let health care providers know when they don't want a procedure or medication, and so on. There are so many informational materials in the office, empowerment guides, rare books, seminars. Women start to question the way they have been treated in other health care settings and why they allowed it to happen and did not speak out. I think women feel more comfortable saying \"no.\" Victoria Evans, R.N., is a practicing registered nurse and writer who has worked in advocacy, non-profit, and health care settings around the country and the world. Her favorite place is Ann Arbor, where she is able to incorporate all of her passions into one setting: advocacy, empowerment, compassion, and communication. Rachel Pastiva: How long have you worked at WomanSafeHealth and how did you become involved in the practice? Victoria Evans: I have worked at WomanSafeHealth and with Dr. Elizabeth since she first went into private practice. Elizabeth's vision and model of practice is one that I believe in to the core. I believe the model of kind and compassionate care can work in health care and I have watched her ideas become reality. She said, from the beginning, that each woman should be able to define her care and then receive it. She has always held that within every woman, there is an empowered woman, and she not only can ask for what she wants and needs but that she can actually get it. Within that idea she has always believed that this can best be achieved in a safe environment. Rachel Pastiva: Do you think the level of care women receive at WomanSafeHealth transforms their beliefs about themselves or their role in their health? If so, how? Victoria Evans : I think the level of care that women receive at WomanSafeHealth can and has transformed their beliefs about themselves. What women learn about themselves while in the care of WomanSafeHealth helps them to go into the world and transform their previous \"bad experiences\" into active and actual changes in thinking. Because \" SQHC: Status Quo Health Care\" is set up to cater to itself and not the needs of individual women, it often creates an environment of having health care handed to her. Rachel Pastiva: What drew you to study nursing, and in what ways do you think nursing has changes since you began studying it, if any? Victoria Evans: I became a nurse late in life, and I often call it my third career: journalism and activism being first, mothering being second, and nursing being my current. So from that perspective, I think I studied nursing and became a nurse at the perfect time in its evolution. Now, more than ever, nurses are autonomous and self-determined. Once upon a time nurses were strictly under the purview of physicians and followed orders. Now nurses take the lead, conduct research, write, and help to empower their clients in every way. At WomanSafeHealth we operate as a multi-disciplinary team. Each practitioner, nurses included, organizes and plans care for each woman together with the woman. Our empowerment is her empowerment. Rachel Pastiva: How do you think your background in nursing informs your writing, or what you choose to write about? Victoria Evans: It's more that my background in writing and communicating informs my nursing. I appreciate the ability to communicate so much that I expect it from everyone I come in contact with, including health care professionals. \"Bedside manner\" is often referred to when describing a physician. Sometimes bedside manner is good, sometimes it's not. The ability to communicate with a client in an honest and forthright way is perhaps the most important task we have at WomanSafeHealth. Many times, women come to us with the most heart-wrenching herstories. It is our job to accept each of them in a kind and open way, to listen with non-judgment, and then devise a care plan to guide her health. It's important work. Victoria Evans \"At WomanSafeHealth we operate as a multi-disciplinary team. Each practitioner, nurses included, organizes and plans care for each woman together with the woman. Our empowerment is her empowerment.\" -Victoria Evans, Registered Nurse Stephanie Macey \"I feel that Chinese medicine is uniquely helpful to women because they have special hormonal issues that change across the lifespan and that respond well to energy changes.\" -Stephanie Macey, Acupuncturist and Registered NursePhoto by Rachel Pastiva Photo by Rachel PastivaThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 42 This style of health care has far reaching effects on women who are facing a health crisis, or who are simply trying to take care of their bodies and well-being. Dr. Shadigian sees the negative impacts of it all the time. I can't really count how many times during the course of my work, in both hospital and private practice, that women have come to me and said, 'The doctor made me feel like there was nothing wrong with me and it's all in my head.' To me, that phrase says it all. That women in the 21 st century, educated and advocating for themselves, continue to have their thinking about their own health and their own intuitions questioned and demeaned by physicians and other health care providers reinforces SQHC: Status Quo Health Care. Every time a woman is belittled for asking her questions or researching her condition, she is less likely to go to the doctor for her concerns. She waits until the last minute to care for herself and it may be too late to have appropriate treatments. As far as I know, this type of research has not been done yet but should be: For women who are abused/neglected by the health care system, what are some of the health outcomes and consequences due to their disrespectful experiences? At WomanSafeHealth, Dr. Shadigian does things differently. \"I deeply respect that each woman is on her own journey and has to figure things out for herself. I just want to be witness to that and want to encourage and help empower each woman to not be afraid to do what she feels is right, rather than doing what everyone else tells her to do.\" In order to help each woman in this way, it is imperative to address what role trauma plays in her life. \"Women have a high rate of personal and health care victimization and [addressing] that needs to be part of their care.\" Among the many ways that women encounter trauma, it is often overlooked that seeking health care can be a traumatic experience. So many women have felt traumatized just from trying to get care for themselves. Feeling not listened to on a regular basis, being told that they are crazy or that they need psychiatric help when in fact they have physical symptoms. And because doctors can't put it together, or choose not to spend the time to put it together, women are shuffled along and their health care needs are not served. Sometimes it's a rare disease, or symptoms may come and go, or maybe it is scary to tell their provider all of their symptoms. Women tend to be less heard, less believed, and so, to me, are less served by most medical systems. But it doesn't have to be that way. For Dr. Shadigian, taking the time to listen to her clients and ask the right questions is the first step to determining their individual needs. If I do not know a woman's trauma herstory, I cannot know what may trigger her during a physical exam or even during a line of questioning. The reason I respect 'no' is a guiding principle is that when a woman is hurt, her 'no' does not matter. At WomanSafeHealth a woman's 'no' is just as valid and important as her 'yes,' if not more so. These guiding principles create a culture of safety and acceptance for each woman. WomanSafeHealth creates a healing community. This is part of the trauma recovery process, whether the trauma is new or old, personal or medical. Knowing a client's story allows Dr. Shadigian and her staff to customize care and provide support for the client's unique needs while building a relationship based on trust and understanding. \"When trauma is addressed head on, the client knows that her health care provider continues to be on her side throughout her health care experiences, day after day and year after year. Whether it's a sensitivity to her when her blood pressure is being taken, or while palpating her neck, or during a pelvic exam, asking what is best for her breaks the past and present traumatic bonds and helps her feel a sense of safety.\" Honoring a woman's personal needs lets her know her needs are important as well as a necessary part of finding the right path The Healing Power of the Right Relationship Continued from page 40 \"Most women prefer to have partners in their health care, not bullies; choices, not dictums. Each woman has a different opinion as to her best health care course and SQHC: Status Quo Health Care rewards a routinized, deaf recitation of what is best for women as a herd.\" -Dr. Elizabeth Shadigianto healing. \"The body remembers trauma whether the rest of the woman does or does not. Having the temperature right for her in the room, a robe that is actually comfortable and fits her, and warm instruments are acts of solidarity with her and for her. Or, in other words, her needs/her body's needs are paramount, and her comfort and safety can easily be accommodated.\" Dr. Shadigian is offering something to her clients that most doctors do not: time. In taking the time to get to know each of her clients and their needs, and then taking the time to modify each woman's care to honor those needs, Dr. Shadigian and her staff build trust with each client, which creates and fosters a healthy relationship among them. \"The relationship is part of the prescription. The relationship is part of the physical exam. The relationship is part of the treatment plan. The relationship is part of everything.\" Just as Dr. Shadigian strives to be present in each encounter, the client is responsible for showing up, too, if true healing is expected to take place. Both the practitioner and the client may mindfully choose to get out of their 'traditional' roles a little bit. The practitioner can choose to work for the highest good of the woman and put her own ego aside and sometimes even her own training \u2014 she can choose to challenge preconceived ideas. She can be open and suspend judgment and say, 'Okay, where is the learning and truth for me, for my client?' And the woman can choose to stretch to become her empowered self and risk saying, 'You know what? I'm going to work towards my highest good. I will take a chance and see if this is a trustworthy practitioner and environment for me. I will test the process too, even if I've been hurt or disappointed before.' And that's hard, especially if the woman has experienced trauma or distrust or self-doubt. The WomanSafeHealth standard of support is unfortunately a standard that will be slow to reach our traditional medical establishment. But that doesn't mean women can't receive the care they need from their health care providers if they empower themselves to ask for what they need. A woman may insist on knowing a health care assistant's name or their role. We can ask the health care provider to sit at the same height as us and actually look at us rather than a computer while we're speaking, or decide not to remove our clothes before a physician enters the room even when we're directed to do so. We can decide if we want any exam or how much of the exam to have done. We can say 'no' to the things we do not want. In a health care system in which the needs of an institution trump those of women, it is up to each of us to give voice to our individual needs if we wish to overcome the status quo. Only when we start holding the medical establishment to our own standards can we hope to see the changes it so strongly needs.

The \"right\" diet is the one that works for you. Since digestive systems, much like finger prints, are unique, the foods that work for you might not work for someone else. However, there are definitely foods and food groups we should only eat sparingly, or not at all. High on that list are refined carbohydrates and grains. Over a year ago, Pam went in for a routine medical exam. She was 54 years old at the time, and had been a strict organic vegetarian for much of her life. Pam wasn't ill or exhibiting any symptoms, but her comprehensive, metabolic blood panel reported high cholesterol and the beginning of insulin resistance. Pam was shocked \u2014 she ate what she thought was a healthy diet, exercised, and had no incidence of high cholesterol in her family. She was surprised to learn from her medical practitioner that her grain-and carbohydrate-rich diet was likely the culprit. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), more than one-third of U.S. adults and 17 percent of U.S. children are obese. Though obesity markedly increases the risk of lifestyle illnesses, such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mental health conditions, there is a growing incidence of illness in healthy-looking people. Many doctors and researchers now believe that illnesses ranging from heart disease to Alzheimer's are not due to overconsumption of fat, but rather grains and carbohydrates. According to Dr. David Perlmutter, a leader in the emerging field of functional neurology, grain-heavy diets are a major contributing factor in the onset of many cognitive disorders. Dr. Perlmutter accuses refined grains and carbs for being addictive, prevalent, harmful, and backed by powerful industries. In his latest book, Grain Brain , he even goes so far as to call gluten, the protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and oats, \"the tobacco of the 21 st century. \" While I don't necessarily believe that all grains are bad and that no one should eat them, I think he does make some interesting points. Wha t's the story behind grains? Humans started cultivating grains 10-20,000 years ago, with the advent of agriculture. However, our bodies haven't changed a whole lot since before the last Ice Age. And while humans certainly continue to evolve, sometimes our genetic evolution cannot keep pace. Drastic dietary changes in recent years have only exacerbated this issue. For example, the grains we consumed then were much different than the grains we consume now. Today's wheat, for example, contains up to 40 times more gluten than grain produced a mere 50 years ago. This is because of hybridization, the process of breeding desirable characteristics such as shorter, browner, higher-yielding wheat varieties. According to Dr. William Davis, author of the best-selling book Wheat Belly, these modern wheat varieties also contain much more gluten than previous generations. Already a difficult protein to digest, the rise of glutinous proteins in our dwindling varieties of wheat puts additional strain on our intestines, and it's way too much for our digestive tracts to handle. Because of this, 1 in 3 Americans are now gluten intolerant, and 8 in 10 have a genetic predisposition for developing the intolerance at some point in their lives, according to Dr. Kenneth Fine, a pioneer in gluten intolerance research. Again, grains are not fundamentally bad, but our immune system just cannot cope with the quantities of grains and carbs we now eat. But ar en't grains supposed to be healthy? There is a big difference between whole grains and refined grains. Whole grains (such as wheat, barley, brown rice, and buckwheat) are much healthier than wonder bread and white flour. This is because whole grains contain more fiber that slows the release of sugars. Still, even with healthy grains, there can be too much. Our bodies just haven't developed the capabilities yet to digest the vast amounts of grains that we consume. Ho w are grains addictive? Researchers discovered in the 1970s that gluten was addictive. When digested, gluten produces compounds that create a pleasurable buzz. These compounds were named \"exorphins\" by the National Institute of Health researcher who discovered them, Christine Zioudrou. This rush is why people love carbs. Ho w prevalent are grains, exactly? The average American consumes 133 pounds of wheat-derived food each year. But wha t's so bad about grains? Grains can lead to digestive disorders, cognitive malfunction, and heart issues, among others. They are the main cause for high cholesterol and lifestyle illnesses such as Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Besides being difficult to digest and potentially leading to digestive disorders from Irritable Bowel Syndrome to Celiac disease, grains also disturb cognitive function. Dr. Perlmutter believes this is so because a) grains elevate blood sugar, leading to insulin resistance; b) consuming grains fills the body with gluten and other potential allergens, putting the body on over-drive or alert; and c) they fuel neurodegeneration, leading to such disorders as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's. Dr. Perlmutter calls grains \"a terrorist group that bullies our most precious organ, the brain. \" Recent studies also strongly suggest that there may be a causal relationship between grain and gluten consumption and cardiovascular disease. Decreased consumption of carbohydrates helps reduce body mass index (BMI), weight, and insulin levels, among other CVD indicators. Ho w do big corporations back grains and what is the concern with that? There are five big companies that control the world's grain trade \u2014 ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Glencore International, and Louis Dreyfus \u2014 commonly referred to as the \" ABCDs. \" These companies routinely spend millions of dollars per year lobbying Washington for support. The \" ABCDs\" can influence government to allow for greater subsidies for grain producers, and can also convince medical practitioners of the health benefits of the grains produced. As mentioned earlier, the \"right\" diet for you might be the \"wrong\" diet for someone else. However, the strength of the grain trade lobby in Washington encourages even organizations like the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) to support grain consumption universally. While not all grains are bad, we need to question why grains represent the largest piece of the food pyramid, and if it's outdated or unsafe for them to be there. Navigating food choices doesn't have to be stressful. By avoiding or removing potential certain problematic foods, you can prevent the onset of illness or overcome chronic disease. After a few months without any grains, Pam significantly lowered her CVD indicators. Though it's okay to enjoy a nice baguette every once in a while, it's important to make the baguette the exception, and not the rule.

Kellie LovePhoto by Maureen McMahonWendi Mekins, Holden Mack, Regan Mack, and Simon FosterThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 45 Over the past seven years the Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth has emerged on the Ann Arbor scene as a vibrant place for community events and a dynamic alternative to Sunday worship. Many have discovered the Center by attending one of their public music events, such as engagements with Kirtan singers Shantala or their Caf\u00e9 704 concert series featuring some of the area's finest musicians. Others may have visited because of their calendar of speaking engagements with popular authors like Judith Coates or Rev. John Mundy. Still, those who eventually join the community were likely persuaded by Interfaith's unique take on Sunday service: an upbeat gathering in which attendees, alongside ministers, provide the texts, meditations, songs, and sermons that are shared, and engage with each other during an open-mic session. Members of the Interfaith Center include people from all walks of life: doctors, carpenters, lawyers, musicians, teachers, and self-taught seekers. For many, it's a home away from home, a place for Sunday service, but, more fully, a community center where they can find meaningful connections with other spiritual seekers throughout the week, be it at a potluck on Tuesday nights, or at a Saturday acoustic concert, or at any of the various study groups that meet to explore spiritual texts and practices. More than just a place to socialize, there are members who say the Center literally saved their lives. And, if you asked, a lot of the membership at Interfaith would identify as \"recovering\" \u2014 be it from institutionalized religion, their formal education, or a previous way of thinking or acting. Those who gather there seem to share a vital interest in charting a personalized approach to spirituality and enjoy doing so in this supportive community setting. It is an eclectic bunch to be sure. A typical Sunday attracts a broad cross section of Ann Arborites, with many attendees old enough to be nearing retirement or to have already raised a family. A youth education program draws in some families and there is a contingent of younger seekers looking for new modes of spiritual exploration. Many different faith backgrounds are represented and there is an air of openness and acceptance. Even with the regular format of spiritual readings, guided meditations, live music, and lessons (sermons), it seems you never know what you're going to get. Invariably, a Hindu chant and a Buddhist meditation might accompany a reading from a Sufi mystic or a page from a best seller picked up off the spiritual development shelf. Sunday music might include a harp concert one week, followed by a drum circle or a modern dance recital the next. It's an eclecticism that is celebrated and somehow works well. As you might expect from a group of seekers, many in the Interfaith community are well read in their areas of interest. There is a depth of knowledge in metaphysical topics and consciousness studies. A New Thought vocabulary is commonly used and many members are at home in the esoteric, just as many are self-identified healers. It is a place where people think critically about their thinking \u2014 but tend to prefer things be light-hearted. Though Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth was established in 1997, Crazy Wisdom Community Journal has never profiled the Center or David Bell, the Center's founder and senior minister. I have been attending there since 2009 and suggested it was time we spotlight this exciting resource and place of opportunity for our readers. What follows is a profile of David Bell by Rachel Urist, someone who had never been to Interfaith before we sent her; plus two personal histories of community members Joy Pendleton and Craig Harvey; and two interviews with Interfaith leadership team members Associate Minister Delyth Balmer and Youth Education Co-Director Kellie Love. \u2014 Maureen McMahon Feature continued on page 46 Photo by Joni Strickfaden Photo by Joni Strickfaden Photo by Maureen McMahonDavid Bell and his wife, Judy Bell Tom VoilesIntroductionThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 46 David Bell: Interfaith Minister and Sometime Lawyer, Accountant, and Politician By Rachel Urist Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth is tucked away in a nondescript business park on Airport Boulevard, across from Costco. Until 2006, when it acquired its current space, the group met at Angell School, then at Forsythe, and classes were held in various homes. Though the Center's location is unprepossessing, its interior has a homespun charm. David Bell explained: When I first proposed we rent it, they thought I was crazy. But I have a builder's license \u2014 and I'm a Taurus. I could see it. It is the perfect space now, and everyone agrees, but most people thought I was nuts. We did all the work ourselves. Lots of tools got broken, but hey, that's okay. Bell, who has an eye for design, suggested a cantilevered arrangement for its second floor offices. This design obviates obstructions. (Without it, posts would have been needed to support the second floor.) An architect in the group drew up the plans, and members of the group built it. The Center is a far cry from the Methodist church of his youth. \"I was taught that Jesus died for our sins, but I could not abide a God who would demand such a blood sacrifice.\" By age 16, he rejected this \"ornery and cantankerous\" God of the Old Testament. \"I was a card-carrying atheist for thirty years!\" He was a good student and graduated from Western Michigan University with a degree in accounting. A professor told him that he had talent and added: \"You're going to law school!\" Bell took the LSAT, scored in the 97 th percentile, and enrolled in the University of Michigan School of Law. He began classes a week after he married his Judy, in 1965. He laughed as he remembered: \"I had $1.65 in my pocket when we returned from our honeymoon. That was all the money we had in the world!\" Judy landed a teaching job. Bell earned his law degree in 1968, then embarked on a peripatetic career. Following law school, he worked for a year as a C.P .A. Then he began practicing law, which he did for eight years. During that time, he ran against Bent F. Nielsen (of Nielsen Flowers) for county commissioner. Bell enjoyed recounting the adventure. \"Reverend Don Shelton was my campaign manager. He created the slogan: 'Elect Bell or get Bent.'\" Bell lost, though it was close. Two years later, he opened a brokerage firm, Continental Capital, with a real estate developer. He soon left to work for E.F. Hutton. That lasted a year. In 1988, he returned to law, and then, in 1996, he turned to divinity. Why? He said it was because of an epiphany he had in the summer of 1985, during a visit to his daughter, who was at Interlochen. As her orchestra played Beethoven's Ninth, Bell had what he called a \"noetic\" experience. It was a \"sudden knowing.\" All of a sudden tears started rolling down my cheeks, and I knew, at that moment, that every thing in the physical universe is an out-picturing; that it has beneath it a matrix of magnificence. It was a revelation. I had never dreamed of asking anything about such matters. I'd been a yuppee workaholic, overachieving, happy. Judy looked, saw tears, and asked: 'Are you alright?' The experience led him to become involved with the Unity Church, where he began teaching and eventually participated as a lay minister. By this time, he was a recovering alcoholic. His search for divinity was multi-determined. He sought compassion and a loving God. He began to practice yoga and meditation. In 1997, he began studying at the New Seminary in New York's Greenwich Village. Rabbi Joseph Gelberman founded it in 1981, along with a Methodist minister; an Indian religious teacher, spiritual master, and yogi; and a Catholic priest. Bell was particularly taken with Rabbi Gelberman, a Hungarian who lost his first wife and daughter in the Holocaust. Gelberman was from a long line of Hassidic rabbis. In the U.S., he was a pulpit rabbi for ten years before earning a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology, which allowed him to separate his spiritual life from his livelihood. He explored Eastern wisdom, ventured into interfaith dialogue, and started a free synagogue. He was in great demand as a speaker, and he died in 2010, at the age of 98. Gelberman's personal axiom was: \"Never instead of, always in addition to.\" He quoted Zen, Indian, Chinese, and Jewish sages. He made a point to live each day as though it was his last (a Jewish injunction), and he peppered his sermons with aphorisms, including: \" The average American man dies at 50 and is buried at 75.\" \"Ha ting is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.\" \" The eleventh commandment is: Thou shall have purpose.\" His followers loved hearing his quotations. A Zen master said: \"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know.\" Rabbi Zusya, a Jewish scholar, said on his deathbed: \"I do not fear that God will ask 'Why were you not like Moses?' But 'Why were you not Zusya?'\" Gelberman was a firm believer that humankind is God's partner in creation. It is our responsibility to maintain and continue the work of creation, to improve and repair and husband God's world. He said: \"I don't have to search for God in the temples and the synagogues or in meditation or in service. I just look at another, and there I see God.\" Gelberman's ideas and his vision of spiritual inclusion \u2014 of seeking divinity in people instead of in institutions \u2014 greatly influenced Bell's interfaith training, spiritual growth, and his involvement with founding the Interfaith Center. Bell himself had long felt a kinship with Jewish history and tradition. He felt \"at home\" at a Jewish friend's funeral. In high school, he said, \"every girl I fell madly in love with was Jewish.\" He recalls the first time he heard Aramaic spoken \u2014 the vernacular of the historical Jesus. \"I jumped out of my skin \u2014 like someone hit me with a cattle prod.\" Reflecting on this connection, he said: \"I was never comfortable in calling myself a Christian. I believe Yeshu [Jesus] was real, a nice Jewish boy from Palestine, and his intention was to wake people up \u2014 never to form a new religion. I have a wonderful relationship with him.\"Feature continued from page 45Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth Photo by Joni Strickfaden \"I was a card-carrying atheist for thirty years!\" -Rev. David Bell\"All of a sudden tears started rolling down my cheeks, and I knew, at that moment, that every thing in the physical universe is an out-picturing; that it has beneath it a matrix of magnificence. It was a revelation. I had never dreamed of asking anything about such matters.\" -Rev. David Bell on his \"noetic\" experience during the summer of 1985He invited me to attend a Sunday service, and I accepted with pleasure. I was advised to come a bit early for the \"meet and greet\" part of the morning. I wasn't quite sure what this was, but I soon found out. Designated greeters, who change weekly, welcomed each arrival with hugs and warm smiles. People were embraced both literally and figuratively in this house of worship and learning. Each attendee was invited to take a program for the morning's service, to look over the assorted announcements and flyers for classes, programs, and activities. There were flyers for upcoming activities and classes in mind-body integration. There were notices of potlucks, meditation workshops, yoga, and the Miracles class. I picked up a pamphlet, entitled: \" Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth: founded on the common thread in all spiritual paths. \" The feeling of warmth followed me into the sanctuary, where I saw friendly faces and felt a sense of openness. I thought of a young family whose recent move to their new home was accomplished entirely on the backs and truck-beds of folks in this community, who showed up early on moving day and didn't quit until the job was done. The sanctuary is a huge room filled with sunlight. The large, southern window that stretches along one wall is framed by purple drapes. Facing east, cushioned purple chairs are arranged in a wide, shallow U. The carpet is steel-blue tweed. This eastern wall features a large, colorful painting of a lotus flower with purple petals that fan into yellow flames of light. The lotus floats above two symmetrically placed olive branches, whose green leaves match the form of the single blue dewdrop (or teardrop) beneath. The room's industrial ceiling, painted pale blue, boasts large, exposed pipes, steel rafters, and fluorescent lighting in the style of the Pompidou Center in Paris. This room, however, is on a more modest scale. The lotus is the Center's leitmotif. It recurs in other paintings and tapestries on the room's walls. These decorations are all handcrafted and donated by members. In front of the eastern wall is a small, round table, which serves as a kind of altar, handmaid to the lotus frontispiece behind it. The table is covered by a striped cloth of muted blue and white, and holds a cylindrical candle, a brass, Tibetan bowl that is sounded like a gong, and a blue planter of chrysanthemums. On the wall behind it, on either side of the lotus painting, glass blocks are arranged in a geometric pattern. These glass lenses filter additional light for the room. As I settled into my seat, music filled the room. Laura Massaro, music director of I.C.S.G., played keyboard. David Bell offered an invocation: \"We are expressions of divinity; our mission is to bring that into consciousness.\" Later in the service, another member stepped forward with his guitar and played his own composition. In the songs, invocations, benedictions, and incantations echo the credo of the Interfaith community: Honor the univ ersal truths in all spiritual paths. Ackno wledge the inseparable Oneness of Spirit with Humankind. Under stand the power of our thoughts in our lives and of co-creation in our communities. Bell offered reminders that we make our own destiny; that life throws us monkey wrenches, but we define ourselves through our reactions. We make adjustments \"by adapting an attitude of openness.\" Prayer, he said, is an \"alignment with divine The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 47 In the Interfaith community, Jesus is generally referred as Yeshu, the diminutive of his Hebrew name, Yehoshua (Joshua) ben Joseph. Bell believes that Yeshu's message is, among other things, that \"death isn't real.\" Bell told me of an encounter with an \"energetic force,\" a spirit called Aaron, channeled by his friend, Barbara Brodsky. According to Bell, Aaron was, in his last incarnation, a Buddhist meditation master. Aaron has told me \u2014 and I have no reason to doubt it \u2014 that I was acquainted with Joshua and was physically present at the crucifixion; that I was a rabbi in those days and a Talmudic scholar; and that my karmic ancestor had become really fed up with the fear-based teachings of Judaism, took a hike and went out into the countryside, near Mt. Carmel, and built things for people. Aaron did not disclose the name of this karmic ancestor. Aaron told me I could find out on my own, in my own meditation practices. This all resonates, rings true to me. I believe that I must have been Jewish in a previous life. Like Gelberman, Bell has created a niche for both teaching and counseling. He teaches \"A Course In Miracles ,\" and said that the text, of the same title, is \"a perfect blend of psychology and spirituality.\" The book was not so much written as transcribed by one Helen Schucman, a clinical psychologist, who heard a recurrent voice that told her to \"take notes.\" So she did \u2014 for seven years. Until that voice insinuated itself, she prided herself on being exceptionally rational. During those seven years, she feared for her sanity. But the book that she \"transcribed\" now inspires others. David Bell is well read in the area of paranormal phenomena. He cites many authors whose books on near-death experiences, prophetic visions, psychic revelations, and visits from the beyond have informed his thinking. He mentioned Raymond Moody, Jr., M.D., whose books include Life After Life, about near death experiences (NDE), and Glimpses of Eternity, which describes the \"shared death experience,\" in which people gathered at the bedside of a dying loved one sometimes describe being lifted out of their bodies and accompanying their loved one part-way into another realm. Moody firmly believes that \"it is our mission is to wake up to the divine love that's there for us.\" Moody, who talked with over a thousand people who had NDEs, became convinced that there is a life after death. \"As a matter of fact,\" he adds, \"I must confess to you [that] I have absolutely no doubt, on the basis of what my patients have told me, that they did get a glimpse of the beyond.\" Bell explained that A Course In Miracles teaches that there is no separation: not from each other, nor from God. \"We wear earth suits \u2014 bodies; but they're impermanent, an illusion,\" said Bell. \"Love, souls, are eternal.\" And Bell believes that there is no such thing as an \"end.\" Bell rejects dogma, but he believes in a recycling of souls; that the soul \"knows when its time is up\" in a particular body; when its mission is accomplished and it is time to move on. He believes that every human being has responsibility for shaping his or her life. When asked about luck, Bell responded: \"I don't believe in luck.\" David Bell article continued on page 48 \"I was never comfortable in calling myself a Christian. I believe Yeshu [Jesus] was real, a nice Jewish boy from Palestine, and his intention was to wake people up \u2014 never to form a new religion. I have a wonderful relationship with him.\" Photo by Joni Strickfaden Photo by Maureen McMahon Designated greeters, who change weekly, welcomed each arrival with hugs and warm smiles. People were embraced both literally and figuratively in this house of worship and learning.Later, David Bell and I talked in his stark but cozy office on the second floor, which we reached by climbing a long, open staircase in the back of the sanctuary. \"I have an eclectic belief system,\" he said, \"and I don't insist that anybody agree with me. People can be who they are, believe what they believe.\" Bell talked about addicts who try \"to fill a void with something tangible. The void is a hole in your soul. The answer is filling it with love and forgiveness.\" He has visited people in prisons, tried \"to be something to hang on to \u2014 a life preserver, if you will.\" He has supported people \"in getting their life together, clean, sober, getting out of legal scrapes. At least one person considers me a surrogate dad.\" He leaned forward and said: \"There's nothing to compare to the heartwarming thanks you get; to hearing people tell you: 'I feel so much better.'\" David Bell left his law practice in 1996. He finds immeasurable rewards in his current life. He and his wife plan to retire within the next few years and spend more of their time in Florida. ### The Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth is located at 704 Airport Boulevard, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48108. Sunday services are held from 10:45 a.m.-12:30 p.m. A full calendar of events and further information can be found at www.interfaithspirit.org.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 48 Continued from page 47Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth David Bell: Interfaith Minister Photo by Maureen McMahon Photo by Joni Strickfadenenergy.\" He defined \"divine\" as \"infinite love and blessings; ineffable joy.\" Expansively grateful, he noted: \"We say thank you thank you thank you.\" It is not surprising that \"Namaste,\" both word and gesture \u2014 palms together in front of heart, accompanied by a slight bow \u2014 is much in use here. Namaste is Sanskrit for \"the Divinity in me salutes the Divinity in you.\" It is the salutation used in India and in yoga classes the world over. It is a greeting, a note of respect, and has gained global currency. Before introducing the guest speaker, Bell announced: \"Today we're trying to be Jewish. We are now in the Days of Awe, the ten days between Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.\" Bell talked about the concepts of judgment and atonement, concluding that the first is of little use to those interested in living a life of compassion, and the second is testament to our capacities to start fresh, to reinvent ourselves and our lives in the pursuit of meaningful existence in the service of ourselves and others. Then he introduced Reverend Lauren Zinn. An ordained interfaith minister active in Ann Arbor's Interfaith Round Table, Zinn's Jewish heritage informs her life choices and today's message. Like Bell, Zinn resists the notion of judgment. She talked about the frightening aspects of the high holy days, about the overwhelming nature of the sins we name, for which we beg forgiveness. She quoted from the Hebrew: loving kindness, repentance, can change the decree.\" Rather than be cowed by the day's fearful liturgy \u2014 \"Who will die by fire, who by water, who by sword...\" \u2014 she exhorted her listeners to: \"Use fire (passion); don't be consumed by it. Use water; don't be buffeted by it, and don't float or drown in it. Use the sword, which is: your strength.\" She spoke of atonement as a transformational process. It is change, self-improvement. Yom Kippur, she said, is a time to make our own judgments as to how to be better. \"It is an act of will. It is a way to let go of the past.\" Zinn enchanted the crowd with stories of how she learns from her students. In citing examples, she demonstrated both learning and humility. These are core values of every religion, and they have been integrated into the Interfaith model. The attendees conclude the service by forming a circle and singing \"Let There Be Peace on Earth,\" followed by the lyrics from a sacred Sufi poem: May the blessings of god rest upon you, / May god's peace abide with you,/ May god's presence illuminate your heart, / Now and forever more. When the service ended, the group retired to the adjoining social hall for refreshments and socializing. There were round tables and chairs, and members (about fifty that day) sat to catch up. I chatted with Delyth Balmer, one of the associate ministers, who pointed out that \"Dave [Bell] is fond of saying that at the Center, there are opportunities, but no obligations.\" I also spoke to Kellie Love, a freckled, blue-eyed, Irish redhead, and co-director of youth education at the Center. She works with children during the service and gets to hobnob with adults afterward. I watched people chat and felt a sense of community. It is not surprising that \"Namaste,\" both word and gesture \u2014 palms together in front of heart, accompanied by a slight bow \u2014 is much in use here. Namaste is Sanskrit for \"the Divinity in me salutes the Divinity in you.\" \"I have an eclectic belief system and I don't insist that anybody agree with me.

Namaste \"the Divinity in me salutes the Divinity in you\"Photo by Maureen McMahon Esther and Norah Reilly Feature continues on the next 3 pages The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 49 Questions for Associate Minister Delyth Balmer Q. Delyth, you are an associate minister at Interfaith. How long have you been a member? A. Fifteen years \u2014 I've been a part of it since it started. Q. How did you meet David Bell? A. I met him through Unity Church of Ann Arbor in 1995. He was a licensed Unity Teacher at that time and later facilitated a study group for A Course in Miracles that I attended. Q. What have been the guiding ideas since the founding of this community? How did Interfaith come about? A. We were influenced by the notion of openness, experience, and co-creation with one another and the higher aspect of our selves. We did not want to abide by any particular religion, yet acknowledged the common thread present in all religions, with recognition that all paths have the capacity to lead us to truth. We place importance on allowing and honoring the pursuit of an individual path. We create a place and space that is supportive of self exploration, where people know and feel loved for who they are. Community participation and community visioning are very important to us. A group of us at Unity Church wanted to have the freedom to explore and practice a wider range of spiritual teachings and to share those teachings \u2014 to be more actively involved in the process of co-creating a spiritual center \u2014 and decided to join Dave. We wanted something more expansive that included Christianity but was not only Christian based. Many of the Unity teachings are operative in our Center , including a belief that God is love; we are not separate from God (or one another); and we have the power to create our own reality and to choose how we see things. There was no oversight from any religious organization during the founding process, nor is there currently. We operated on the belief that all are connected to the Divine, there is no hierarchy. In other words, while there may be roles to take on \u2014 minister, board of trustees, spiritual practitioners, group leaders \u2014 no one has an exclusive connection to the Divine that must serve as an intermediary for others. Q. Does that co-creation ideal live on fifteen years later? A. I believe it does. Our Sunday Celebration services continue to be based on an open invitation to anyone to lead a meditation, share a spiritual reading, or give a sermon. We encourage people to start a class or regular meet-up group \u2014 all our activities are initiated by community members. There are regular meetings for study of Science of Mind, A Course in Miracles, The Way of Mastery , Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth, and the Urantia Book. We have Balanced View Clarity Calls, Reiki shares, writing groups, speaking circles, shamanic journeying, and meditation gatherings. There are monthy Caf\u00e9 704 concerts, drumming circles, and spiritual cinema nights. Since we moved here six years ago, we've added many new activities because we have a great facility with space to hold them. Q. Do you participate in one activity in particular? A. I've been involved in many, but one that stands out for me is the Speaking Circle hosted by another of our associate ministers, Annie Kopko. It's based on the work of Lee Glickstein and his book Be Heard Now! According to his philosophy, being in the presence of people who send you unconditional regard while you are speaking helps diminish your fears and allows you to speak from a place of authenticity . It's about developing trust and confidence and connection. The purpose is not to create polished or persuasive speakers but to allow for the experience of being heard as we speak from the heart, something we all desire. Q. Tell us a little about your background. A. I was born and raised in Detroit. I attended Central Michigan and later graduated from Eastern Michigan with a Master 's in Speech-Language Pathology. Aside from my role at the Interfaith Center, I work as a speech-language pathologist in a residential brain injury center in Ann Arbor. I was ordained as an Interfaith Minister in 2009 through the Fellowship for Today in East Lansing. I then served as an associate minister at the Interfaith Center and, in January of 2012, I took on the role of administrator. My religious background is Christian. I attended a Lutheran church while growing up, and later my parents became Jehovah' s Witnesses. Prior to finding Unity, my church attendance as an adult revolved around Christmas and Easter . I have two daughters, ages 27 and 24, who were adopted from South Korea as infants. I wanted to expose them to religion but also allow them to make their own choice. My spiritual practice continues to revolve around A Course in Miracles and \"Vipassana Meditation and Spiritual Inquiry\" through the Deep Spring Center in Ann Arbor. My daughter's are both living out of state now. Interfaith really is my \"family.\" It's been wonderful to be a part of this organization, I feel very blessed. Many of the founding members are still here. We have holiday dinners here, many people bring their nuclear family to their Interfaith family for the holidays. We have parties and do fun things together. People pitch in and help one another. It's a very close group, but not exclusive. Often people say they feel like they're home here. They feel accepted, loved, and welcomed. \"We did not want to abide by any particular religion, yet acknowledged the common thread present in all religions, with recognition that all paths have the capacity to lead us to truth.\" -Associate Minister Delyth Balmer on the founding of the Interfaith Center \"We operated on the belief that all are connected to the Divine, there is no hierarchy. In other words, while there may be roles to take on \u2014 minister, board of trustees, spiritual practitioners, group leaders \u2014 no one has an exclusive connection to the Divine that must serve as an intermediary for others.\" \"There are regular meetings for study of Science of Mind, A Course in Miracles, The Way of Mastery, Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth, and the Urantia Book. We have Balanced View Clarity Calls, Reiki shares, writing groups, speaking circles, shamanic journeying, and meditation gatherings.\" Photo by Joni StrickfadenCraig Harvey's Interfaith Path I was raised Catholic, but I never felt like it meant much to me. I had friends who were Protestant and Jewish, and it never made any sense that one religion was the only right path to any kind of salvation. I was rather materialistic going into college \u2014 got a degree in mechanical engineering. But, while doing that, I also expanded my horizons a bit, indulging in certain substances and reading Carlos Casteneda books that my older brother got me started on (the books, not the other stuff). After getting my degree and moving to Ann Arbor, I spent about five years involved in Scientology, which was great for me, until it wasn't. Since then I have always had good close friends with whom I felt a spiritual bond, but I still had a desire for a larger spiritual community. I spent a few years attending the Unitarian Universalist congregation, enjoying services led by Ken Phifer and Eva Hochgraf, while occasionally attending Friends meetings. Then I met someone who told me about the Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth. As I approached the door for my first Sunday service (then at Allen School), a very happy woman with outstretched arms greeted me saying, \"Hi! Would you like a hug?\" I considered this a very good sign. Since then I have attended almost every Sunday that I haven't been out of town. I've served a couple years on the Board during our transition to having our own (rented) building; helped on the construction/renovation needed for move-in; chaired at least one committee; run the grocery card donation program for many years; video recorded many services and other events; dared to sing in the choir (thanks to the incredibly accepting nature of the group); and even delivered a couple Sunday messages (\"sermons\") of my own. I love the openness of the group, that it encourages the public sharing of individual viewpoints and feedback on sermons, best shown by the standard open-mic time following every Sunday message. Since having our own space, the Interfaith Center has also been the home for the \"Peace Generator\" silent monthly meditation circle that I have been leading in various formats since early 2001( peacegenerator.org). The original inspiration was to get a few hundred people from any and all faiths and meditation/healing practices to commit to an hour a week at various times in one location to allow an ongoing 24/7 world healing circle \u2014 sitting in silent meditation/prayer for inner and outer peace. My first step in that direction was a one-hour weekly meditation at Crazy Wisdom. Eventually, I found a few churches around town where I could host a 24-hour gathering once a month (people coming and going throughout the 24 hours). I kept that up for two years. Now it is usually a two-hour event on the third Friday of the month, except a couple times a year when I hold the space for 24 hours. The next 24-hour Peace Generator is 6:00 p.m. Friday, September 20 through 6:00 p.m. Saturday, September 21, in honor of the United Nations International Day of Peace.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 50 Ann Arbor's Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth \"The original inspiration was to get a few hundred people from any and all faiths and meditation/healing practices to commit to an hour a week at various times in one location to allow an ongoing 24/7 world healing circle \u2014 sitting in silent meditation/prayer for inner and outer peace.\" -Craig Harvey, facilitator of Interfaith's 24-hour Peace GeneratorPhoto McMahonFinding a Home at Interfaith By Joy Pendleton My name is Joy Pendleton and I have been a member of the Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth for 15 years, almost since its inception. My faith background goes back to Alaska when my family moved a lot to various small towns and we usually chose the only Protestant church in town. Even as a child, I had questions that didn't have answers. Why, if God is love, were we told to fear God, or that if we did \"bad things,\" we were going to hell? I moved to Ann Arbor in 1982 and joined a Protestant metaphysical church, but soon I was objecting to many of the beliefs there. The church was going to have a reunion of all the past ministers and all were invited except one who was believed to have confiscated money. I asked, Why, if our church was forgiving, couldn't he be invited too? My minister reacted in horror to my question. There were many other reasons, too, but I needed to forgive, forget, and move on. I started attending A Course in Miracles study group with some likeminded friends and decided that would be my \"church.\" No actual churches for me! A friend of mine kept calling me about this new center that was starting up and said that the associate minister from my previous church, Dave Bell, would be leading it. It would not technically be a church because it was more than Christian, incorporating all faiths. I decided to try it. The Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth started out at the New Center first. Once I started attending, I immediately realized I had missed the camaraderie of my old friends, many of whom had already joined Interfaith. I appreciated the wonderful like-mindedness everyone had \u2014 love was foremost. The Center has moved several times through the 15 years I've been a member and we now are situated in our own home on Airport Boulevard. It's good to be home! Unless I am sick or out of town, I always try to attend Interfaith. The messages really speak to my heart. I have cried often in joy or from being very moved. Through the years, I have been on the Board and become active spiritually . I have facilitated the volunteers who greet people on Sundays for over 10 years, helped at fundraisers, belonged to the caring committee, read meditations and readings, and helped the needy \u2014 but always I was the one who was helped the most. I feel I am \"evolving,\" so I am so grateful to have a center like this. The Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth is not a middleman to God, like many perceive a church to be. There are a lot of different beliefs here: people who identify with fairies, angels, and nature spirits, and those who are or were Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Muslim, and more. We are all on a different path and/or have no path at all. All are accepted and we learn from each other. The congregation is now talking about interspirituality rather than interfaith. Wow, count me in! Let's eliminate the different faiths and dogmas that might divide us and recognize our oneness together. \"There are a lot of different beliefs here: people who identify with fairies, angels, and nature spirits, and those who are or were Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Muslim, and more...

Kellie, you are a youth educator and board chair at Interfaith. When you're not teaching on Sundays, you are running a green cleaning business with your husband. What drew you to Interfaith?A. Yes, I am a co-director of youth education, along with Heide Kaminski. We work with the kids who come to the Sunday service and we have lots of fun. I am also on the board; it helps me connect outside of the classroom. What drew me to Interfaith? An evolution in the beliefs I grew up with. I was raised Catholic and never felt I belonged, due in large parts to their views of women and homosexuals. My Catholic heritage gave me a good base for faith, but I felt the need to explore other options. A friend introduced me to Interfaith and I immediately felt welcomed and accepted. I always felt that I had my own relationship with God and didn't need to go through the hierarchy or pomp and circumstance that many religions have. I'm a free thinker and one thing I liked was that Interfaith respects and encourages me to explore the path that speaks to me. Peace, kindness, compassion, and service are in all religions. If I believe and support those values among others, I don't feel the need to believe in one particular creed. One of my favorite bumper stickers is \"God is too big to fit into one religion.\" We have great talks at the Center. I miss the services because we are with the kids, so I try to listen to the ones that have been recorded and posted on the Interfaith YouTube page. Q. How many kids are in the youth education program? A. Sometimes we get 6, or 1, or 15 on Sundays. They meet as a single group unless we can break them up into more age appropriate sections, teens and younger children. Q. What are some of the activities you do with the kids? What was \"Make a Difference Day\"?A. \"Make a Difference Day\" was when we went with the kids to Alpha House, a transitional home. We served a meal \u2014 soup and sandwiches \u2014 and ate with the people who live there. It fits with our values of service, of helping people. We also have celebrations with the kids for various holidays. Heide and I are creating our own curriculum. It's exciting and I love writing lesson plans. Each week there's a theme, such as tolerance, homelessness, hunger, and what we can do to make a difference. One recent month focused on life-long learning. I'm 38 and I've been involved here since 2001. Some of the children we've taught are done with college now. One's a Harvard grad. We're sending them off into the world to change it.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 51 Photo by Maureen McMahon \"Each week there's a theme, such as tolerance, homelessness, hunger, and what we can do to make a difference.

Arriving at Esalen I was driving south on California Highway 1 below Carmel headed to the Esalen Institute just south of the village of Big Sur that is also the name of this fifty-mile stretch of coastline. It was early October 2012. The two-lane highway hugs the side of the Santa Lucia Mountains on the left, and on the right are guardrails in front of a precipice with Pacific waves pounding the rocky shore hundreds of feet below. When I drove this stretch down to the Esalen Institute two years earlier in heavy rain the highway was treacherously strewn with rocks loosened by the downpour. But on my return visit the sun warmed the mountainside. I remember two years earlier slowing around this point so as not to miss the approaching small sign on the right marking the entrance: Esalen Institute by Reservation Only. I drove down the long steep road to the gatehouse: \"Richard Gull \u2014 here for Katy Butler's workshop 'Straw into Gold: The alchemy of memoir.'\" The gatekeeper checked a list and directed me to an uphill road off to the left; on the right were rows for parking enclosed by large pines and bushes that make the parked cars invisible from the rest of the grounds. Esalen is located on a 27-acre shelf of land on a mountainside, bordered by Highway 1 on the back, and on its outer edge are cliffs overlooking the Pacific. A cool breeze off the ocean carried a whiff of salt sea air. I picked up my room key in the office inside a one-story redwood lodge that also houses a dining area where abundant healthy food is available cafeteria-style. Large windows provide unobstructed views of the seascape. The smell of fresh-baked bread wafts from the kitchen. I instinctively scanned the kelp beds near shore for sea otters while birds glide low looking for fish.Attached to the lodge is a meetinghouse called \"Huxley,\" named after writer Aldous Huxley, whose idea of \"the human potential\" was an inspiration for Esalen. I recall two years ago attending yoga, sacred dance, and meditation sessions there in the early mornings. I danced wildly one morning, freely improvising movements in a group of people doing the same thing, led by a dance instructor in a flowing black dress wearing a red boa. My first time at Esalen, two years earlier, in October 2010, my wife, Sara, had died of cancer the previous March. I had spent five years as her caregiver. A close friend from high school had died four months before Sara's death. Grief drew me here the first time to write a memoir. I remember looking at the ocean then and recalling a mystical passage from Moby-Dick. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop. A tear in the sea; human emotion engulfed by a vast oneness. I wrote a memoir about the shared memories the dead take with them and then how their memories will disappear when I do. The reason for my return visit two years later was different from the first: to celebrate Esalen's 50 th anniversary. I would also attend the 50th anniversary celebration of The Port Huron Statement in Ann Arbor in three weeks. Esalen was the epicenter of America's spiritual reformation and The Port Huron Statement was a manifesto for political transformation. But how were they related? Why were neither spirituality nor religion mentioned in The Port Huron Statement? I also wanted to write a memoir to explain my own spiritual epiphany: that I would not call myself an atheist any longer. As the saying goes, \"I am spiritual, not religious\"; but I now say, more paradoxically, that I have \"a religion of no religion.\" My room this time was on the edge of a cliff up stone stairs just south of the lodge in a suite of wooden cabins called \"Rolf,\" named after Ida Rolf, whose bodywork technique, Rolfing, was made famous here in the 1960s. With a view of blue sky meeting ocean at the horizon and waves crashing over rocks below, the deep sound will cradle my sleep for the next five nights. Two years ago I had a room with a more distant view in a suite called \"Maslow,\" named after self-actualization psychologist Abraham Maslow, who contributed Fifty years ago the human potential movement started at Esalen. That same year, 1962, The Port Huron Statement of Students for a Democratic Society appeared, a political manifesto challenging a new generation to live authentic lives in a participatory democracy. I attended both 50th anniversary celebrations in October 2012. I had taken a class on memoir writing at Esalen two years earlier, in 2010, six months after my wife, Sara, died of cancer. I returned last year to take the memoir class again, this time with the purpose of writing a memoir about Esalen's own spirituality and its connection to the cluster of transformational political movements of the 1960s. Since a memoir should show how its author has changed, this memoir explains why I don't call myself an atheist any longer. I explain my version of \"a religion of no religion\" inspired by Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion by Jeffrey Kripal. at 50 ~ A Memoir about America's Spiritual Reformation By Richard Gull Lodge and Bookstore Fifty years ago the human potential movement started at Esalen.

Stretching north of the lodge is a grassy open space and a garden with neat rows of flowers and organic vegetables that supply the kitchen. Red trumpet vine and sunflowers attract colonies of monarch butterflies. In the garden is a statue called the The Red Lady symbolizing the spirit of Esalen. She is earthy red, nude, arms extended upward, head tilted upward toward the sky above the Pacific; her right foot is on the ground, her left knee is raised. Beyond the gardens is Hot Springs Creek. Its rock chasm must be crossed by a small wooden bridge in order to reach \"The Big House\" and \"Price House\" where workshops are held. \"Price\" is named after Esalen's co-founder Richard Price, who died in a hiking accident in the mountains above Esalen in 1985. Mineral hot springs supply the nude baths and massage center. Esalen is named after the ancient Esselen tribe of Native Americans who, legend has it, regarded it as sacred place of healing and burial because of its confluence of mineral, salt, and fresh waters. As Walter Truett Anderson, a biographer of Esalen, writes: \"If a place can have charisma, then surely this one has it. It is difficult to imagine any pursuit for which this enchanting piece of land would not be an asset.\" Cell phones don't work here, a sure sign that you've entered sacred space. Esalen has been referred to as a \"secular monastery,\" yet it has no architectural monastery. What makes it a secular monastery is its confluence of spirituality, nature, and democratic ideals. Esalen is an experiment in a uniquely American form of mysticism. 2. The Birth of Esalen and Esalen Today 2012 was Esalen's 50th anniversary. Its co-founders Michael Murphy and Richard Price were both students at Stanford in the 1950s. Both were psychology majors, both were turned on to Asian religious thought at Stanford by professor of comparative religion Frederic Spiegelberg, both shared his concept of \"a religion of no religion,\" and both had served in the military. But Murphy and Price did not meet until 1960, in the North Beach Beat scene in San Francisco. Murphy had been toying with the idea of starting a meditation and study center guided by ideas of non-dualistically (holistically) synthesizing Eastern and Western thought, science and religion, mind and body, the built environment and nature, and developing what Huxley had called \"the human potential.\" Murphy and Price decided to become partners in this endeavor. Murphy's paternal grandmother, Bunny, held the deed to this property that had been owned by the family since 1910 and was called Slate's Hot Springs. She reluctantly granted them a long-term lease in late 1961; she suspected that Michael would bring a lot of \"hindoos\" to the place. On the grounds, at that time, there were cabins for rent, a restaurant and bar, and a few local residents, including a folk singer named Joan Baez and novelist Henry Miller. Miller often frequented the mineral baths during the day. At night, the baths were taken over by gay men from San Francisco and Los Angeles and roughhewn local types from the bar. One immediate problem was that, by 1961, the bath scene had turned ugly. Bunny had hired a young Hunter S. Thompson, later to become the famous Gonzo journalist, to guard the place and break up fights. One night he was assaulted by a group on the path down to the baths, beaten, and nearly thrown over a cliff. The rowdy night bathers refused to leave. After a gated fence failed to keep them out, eventually Murphy, Price, and several others, including Joan Baez, accompanied by three snarling Dobermans, drove them out. The sound of the dogs cleared out the baths even before the group arrived to find them empty; they heard car doors slamming and engines starting near the highway above. Esalen today offers hundreds of workshops and events each year. Most participants are women. Women hold positions on the board of directors and one woman managed programming for 25 years. Topics offered this year include writing, leadership, worldviews, ecology, painting, bodywork, yoga, meditation, gay men thriving at midlife, and biblical stories. One workshop is called: \"From Me to We: The change required to rescue the planet and your life.\" Esalen has been referred to as a \"secular monastery,\" yet it has no architectural monastery. What makes it a secular monastery is its confluence of spirituality, nature, and democratic ideals. Esalen is an experiment in a uniquely American form of mysticism. 2012 was Esalen's 50th anniversary. Its co- founders Michael Murphy and Richard Price were both students at Stanford in the 1950s. Esalen has an intellectual side that Murphy cultivated, bringing in an eclectic array of scientists, psychologists, biologists, politicians, and theologians. Michael Murphy has called himself a \"quantum mystic,\" using quantum mechanics as an inspiration for metaphysical speculation, as did many mystically- inclined physicists who met at Esalen in the 1970s. Continued on page 54 The Red Lady symbolizing the spirit of Esalen. She is earthy red, nude, arms extended upward, head tilted upward toward the sky above the Pacific; her right foot is on the ground, her left knee is raised.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 54 Esalen has two levels, a community and a think tank, reflecting the difference in the personalities of its two founders. Richard Price wrote nothing; his interests were making Esalen work as a community and his gestalt practice. He was skeptical of talk of a new age of Enlightenment. He once said: I was never as sold as some people on the idea of the new age. My focus was more on the question of how you operate the type of counseling and psychological work that goes on here. That's more interesting to me than bringing in the millennium. If the millennium happens in the process, that's fine too. Michael Murphy, now an emeritus board member, is a philosopher and visionary. As early as 1965, Murphy began a citizen diplomacy program with the Soviet Union and China on topics such as psychic research and the psychology of athletics, attracting many foreign visitors to Esalen. Esalen has an intellectual side that Murphy cultivated, bringing in an eclectic array of scientists, psychologists, biologists, politicians, and theologians. Topics included the philosophical implications of evolutionary theory, the ethics of ecology and sustainability, empirical postmortem survival research, Bell's theorem from quantum physics, and fundamentalist challenges to scholarship in religion. Murphy published philosophical works including novels. He writes: \"We are certain that a surprising transformation of the human form is possible through the agency of spirit and that in some sense evolution intends this. The problem of course is in forming the discipline to give it birth.\" He was always searching for paradigm-shifters. He has called himself a \"quantum mystic,\" using quantum physics as an inspiration for metaphysical speculation, as did many mystically-inclined physicists who met at Esalen in the 1970s. When I was there last October, a conference of economists was discussing complexity theory and economics and I attended a public lecture held in Huxley. There were jokes about naked economists invading the baths. The discussion was about why, in the wake of the recent severe economic recession, current economic models failed to predict it. One discussion question was: \"Why are there 500 brands of breakfast cereal on grocery shelves and yet the best is the home-made granola from the Esalen kitchen?\" 3. Psychedelics and MysticismFor the first two years at Esalen, seminars were more cultural presentations with audiences than countercultural events in which everyone participated. They included the Beat Zen philosopher Alan Watts speaking on drug-induced mysticism, San Francisco poet and mountaineer Kenneth Rexroth, and British philosopher of history Arnold Toynbee, who spoke on the importance of the transmission of Buddhism to the West in the twentieth century. A session with Joan Baez was called \"The New Folk Music.\" Alan Watts was a well-known bohemian interpreter of Eastern mysticism. His Taoist teaching was to follow your own perverse way: \"To 'follow your own weird' is...to accept your own karma, or fate, or destiny, and thus be odd in the service of God.\" Watts had tried psychedelic drugs and had written of his experiences in an essay called \"The New Alchemy\" and in his book The Joyous Cosmology. The book has numerous photographs of abstract geometrical shapes taken from the natural universe: patterns on the surface of an agate, the geometrical feeding patterns of caterpillars, the spirals of galaxies. Watts' chemical mysticism induced a microscopic vision allowing the mind to delve deeper into \"the intricately dancing texture of our world.\" He thought that the pharmacologist could free spiritual experience from the traditional obscurantist practices of \"seers and mystics\" that were \"rickety and piled with excess baggage.\" But he was skeptical about drug-induced religious insights claimed by some. In 1961, scholar of religion Huston Smith, an Esalen participant, contacted Timothy Leary at Harvard's Center for Personality Research to arrange an experimental mescaline session. (Leary briefly came to Esalen in the late 60's). Thenceforth Smith wrote eloquently about psychedelics calling them \"entheogens,\" literally translated as substances that \"generate God within.\" But didn't the entheogens only catalyze what Smith already believed, making empirical a system he had already absorbed? Psychedelics seemed to propel some people to cosmic conclusions. Watts, Leary, and Smith were inspired by Aldous Huxley's early 1950s philosophical essay \"The Doors of Perception\" that had become a manifesto for 50's and early 60's Beat, North Beach psychedelic mysticism. Both countercultural scenes manifested themselves at Esalen. In the later 60's, \"Doors\" would become scripture for the hippie, Haight-Ashbury countercultural drug scene. The psychedelically inclined rock group The Doors took their name from this text. Huxley was the grandson of biologist Julian Huxley, known as \"Darwin's bulldog\" for his vigorous defense of evolution. Aldous thought that our brain and nervous system had been shaped by our biological survival. Yet each of us is potentially a \"Mind-at-Large,\" capable of experiencing things beyond the limiting filters of our inherited biology. Two ways of bypassing these \"walls of perception\" are two doors of perception: \"deliberate 'spiritual practices'\" and mind altering drugs. These deliberate spiritual practices include the visual arts and meditation. Painters often take an ordinary object like a chair and make it strange by removing it from the ordinary matrix of space to reveal its \"suchness,\" foregrounding color and texture over place and dimension. Huxley writes: \"...We must preserve, and, if necessary, intensify our ability to look at the world directly and not through the half-opaque medium of concepts.\" But though there are multiple bypasses around the filters of our survival-oriented nervous system and language, including mind-altering drugs, we must at the same time survive in this world using systematic reasoning. Systematic reasoning is something we could not possibly, as a species or as individuals, do without. But neither, if we are to remain sane, can we possibly do without direct perception, the more unsystematic the better, of the inner and outer worlds in to which we have been born. (\"The Doors of Perception\") Huxley died of cancer in the early morning of November 22, 1963. At his request, his wife injected him with L.S.D. some hours earlier so that he would exit high on artistic visions. John F. Kennedy's assassination later that day overshadowed Huxley's death. In his novel, Island, a goddess gives a prayer that not only captures Huxley's notion of a humanistic religion but also expresses Esalen's religion of no religion: \"Give us this day our daily Faith, but deliver us, dear God, from Belief.\" Murphy and Price often voiced a similar sentiment saying that, at Esalen, \"No one captures the flag\" and \"We wear our dogmas lightly.\" 4. Gestalt and Encounter Groups By 1964, more experiential programming began to appear in the form of gestalt workshops and encounter groups. Fritz Perls came on the scene offering workshops in gestalt therapy. Perls had fled Germany for South Africa in the1930s, having been a Jew on a Nazi blacklist that also included Frederic Spiegelberg. Trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst, he came to reject the unearthing of the unconscious and its conservative goal of \"adjustment.\" Perls concentrated \"on what is rather than why it is, in the present rather than in the past.\" Although he often sarcastically rejected philosophy as \"elephant shit\" and was an atheist who distrusted religions, Aldous Huxley, whose idea of \"the human potential\" was an inspiration for Esalen at 50 Continued from page 53 \"Give us this day our daily Faith, but deliver us, dear God, from Belief.\" -Aldous Huxley \"To 'follow your own weird' is... to accept your own karma, or fate, or destiny, and thus be odd in the service of God.\" -Alan Watts, Esalen contributor in the 1960sWatts, Leary, and Smith were inspired by Aldous Huxley's early 1950s philosophical essay \"The Doors of Perception\" that had become a manifesto for 50's and early 60's Beat, North Beach psychedelic mysticism. Both countercultural scenes manifested themselves at Esalen. By 1964, more experiential programming began to appear in the form of gestalt workshops and encounter groups. Fritz Perls came on the scene offering workshops in gestalt therapy. Alan WattsAldous HuxleyThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 55 he playfully called his methods \"Jewish Zen.\" He famously had participants sit in the \"hot seat\" while he took apart their defenses and had them enact psychodramas in order to reintegrate the self into a new whole or gestalt. At bottom Perls was an existentialist pushing people to take responsibility for the self they had constructed like an actor on a stage. This was his version of a religion of no religion. After Perls left in 1969, Richard Price, a much less confronting leader than Perls, took over the gestalt lineage. Price turned gestalt from a therapy into a practice. Murphy, reflecting back on Price after his death, said: \"There was in him something of both John Muir [naturalist, founder of the Sierra Club] and a wild Taoist monk.\" In the 1950s, before Price met Murphy, he had been forced into insulin shock treatments for innocent behavior resulting from the crisis of his own spiritual transformation; as a result, he had an ethic conscious of the damage so-called healers can do. The \"hot seat\" became the \"open coercion\"; he said: \"I'm Dick, not Fritz.\" Encounter workshops also became a staple offering at Esalen in the 60's. Former Harvard psychology professor Will Shutz was their most influential group leader. People explored their reactions to each other unfiltered by ordinary politeness, stripping away pretensions, and sometimes even their clothes in order, in the end, to discover their oneness with others. Compare this with Quaker meetings in which people gather in silence to speak as the spirit moves them, but without interrupting or arguing with each other. In encounter groups people also react to each other as the spirit moves them \u2014 to confront each other. In Quaker meetings a ritual of silence and speaking before God creates community. In the encounter group, by contrast, the absence of ritual, guided by a leader, is supposed to create a sense of joy at realizing one's potential through this altered state, as well as a feeling of oneness with others. (Perls, who competed with Shutz for fame, called him \"joy boy.\") The encounter version of the religion of no religion allows participants to experientially enter into an altered state of sincere impoliteness, or, in more religious language, sanctified conflict. Shutz thought of encounter as an instrument for realizing not only individual potential, but as a laboratory exercise for participation in a democratic society. There were even interracial encounter groups in the late 1960s that Esalen held in San Francisco at a short-lived San Francisco satellite. This earned Esalen the appellation \"mini-San Francisco,\" pointing up its connection to the vibrant Sunset at Esalen At bottom Perls was an existentialist pushing people to take responsibility for the self they had constructed like an actor on a stage. This was his version of a religion of no religion. In 1973, Esalen itself went through a transforming self-examination of guru tyranny and the oppression of women. Some group leaders were guilty of taking advantage of their power, especially over women.

But some African-Americans, in encounter group fashion, noted the satellite's de facto separation from Esalen at Big Sur and referred to it as \"going South,\" a reference to Esalen being predominantly white. Though the encounter movement spread and flourished outside of Esalen, encounter offerings ended there by the early 1970s. Murphy and Price considered them too confrontational and dangerous; some people were injured. In 1973, Esalen itself went through a transforming self-examination of guru tyranny and the oppression of women. Some group leaders were guilty of taking advantage of their power, especially over women. At the same time, a feminist version of the encounter method was flourishing in the form of \"consciousness-raising\" groups. Many women used these groups to come to terms with anger over their subordination and to forge new identities in solidarity with other women; the personal became the political. According to feminist historian Linda Gordon: Consciousness-raising groups were intensely enjoyable. We ate and listened to music; we were ecstatic when Jefferson Airplane released \"Volunteers.\" Members hated to miss a meeting. They constituted a respite from daily pressures, an island, a weekly free space within a far more complex and hierarchical life of jobs, bosses, coworkers, families, bureaucracies,...none of which operated according to our rules. This is why consciousness-raising meetings were so much fun. They were not required to be immediately goal-oriented, so they allowed for brainstorming that turned out to be highly productive.\" (Inspiring Participatory Democracy) Although encounter ended at Esalen, gestalt workshops of a gentler sort than Perl's continue there to this day. On my previous visit two years earlier, during an afternoon break from my memoir seminar, I decided on impulse to participate in a gestalt session held in a yurt called \"Fritz,\" named after Perls. The yurt was inspired by the work of architectural visionary Buckminster Fuller, another Esalen contributor. I arrived late. A young woman was discussing some of her family troubles and, just as I walked in, the two group leaders asked her to pick people to play each of her family members in a psychodrama. She immediately picked me to play her \"father,\" then she picked her \"mother\" and her \"sister.\" My late wife, Sara, had been a psycho-dramatist trained by its founder Jacob Moreno, for whom spontaneity was a religion. Since I had participated in many of her workshops and had often been typecast to play someone's father, this was familiar territory. I often joked that I could start a rent-a-dad business. The next afternoon in the nude bathing area I encountered the young woman who played the \"sister\" whose \"father\" I had played in the previous day's psychodrama. As we walked by each other, I said, \"Hi, daughter.\" She smiled back and said, \"Hi, Dad.\" A young man accompanied her. As if continuing the psychodrama, I said with mock seriousness: \"What are you doing with this young man?\" She said back with mock indignation: \"I'm not going to let you control my life anymore!\" We laughed and walked on by. It was, to me, a signature Esalen moment \u2014 a unique altered state of playfulness that brought unexpected pieces together: tantric humor, grief, freedom. Like a Rorschach inkblot picture, interpretations will depend on how one feels about the connections between one's body and community. Not everyone chooses to participate, of course. My second time at Esalen I felt older than the first. An idiopathic numbness in my legs had come on nine months earlier; I felt my mortality. I went to the baths anyway: meditated, talked, contemplated the sea, and got a massage. The incandescence of the setting sun sank below the horizon and the sea darkened. 5. Synchronicities Looking back, I now regard the coincidence of my mourning Sara's death and my unexpectedly being picked to play a father as an instance of synchronicity, a concept introduced by the depth psychologist Carl Jung and often used at early Esalen. Jung thought of synchronicity as a non-causal relationship between events in addition to space, time, and causality whereby the world is revealed as a mystery to be interpreted. Coincidences at times seem to be more meaningful than simply two randomly occurring events. For example, my granddaughter Simone's bat mitzvah, a Jewish ritual for young women marking the transition to adulthood, was in 2007. For weeks there was a family of mourning doves nesting on the front porch whose babies flew away the day of the ceremony. (Simone said: \"But, Mom, I'm not ready to fly away yet.\") Another synchronicity: While I was writing this article, Simone e-mailed me from Stanford, where she was a freshman, to tell me that an atheist chaplain was just hired there; it was good to hear that Professor Spiegelberg's idea of a religion of no religion is still alive on that campus. Another example of synchronicity: As I was working on this article at my dining room table by the patio window two days ago, I looked up and saw a pair of deer lying in the snow in my backyard looking at me. After several hours, they stood up and I noticed that one had an injured right hind leg that she kept lifted as she staggered a few steps with difficulty. They stood together licking each other's faces and intertwining their necks like lovers. I watched this happen from the bedroom window in which, two years earlier, I had cared for Sara while she was in hospice at home for six weeks before she died of cancer. Or consider the Christian philosopher St. Augustine in 386 C.E. weeping over the state of his soul under a fig tree when he heard a child's voice singing \"take and read.\" This prodded him to take up a text of St. Paul's that in turn led him to convert to Christianity. And Michael Murphy kept a \"Journal of Synchronicities\" that he believed gave meaning to the birth of Esalen. Synchronicities tend to pile up as one notices them and they beckon for an interpretation. To read them is to regard one's experience and one's history, not as a sequence of random events, but as a series of texts to be read and interpreted for meanings. Birds, deer, and psychodramas become signs or omens. One could be inspired to carry out an in depth, active interpretation, by creating another text, a memoir, of their interconnections. Synchronicities multiply as one imbeds them in a story. Life becomes a gestalt of which one is a part. There's a saying: \"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.\" But skeptical philosophers would point out that synchronicities are instances of the Projection Fallacy: We project the workings of our own mind onto the universe thereby creating the illusion that coincidences we experience are part of a cosmic plan. Or they are the result of Confirmation Bias: We ignore the times we missed a plane and it didn't crash. Yet our projections and biases reveal our deep need to be part of a cosmic gestalt. Freud describes this mystical feeling as oceanic, a vestige we carry forward from our time spent in the womb before birth. at 50 Continued from page 55 Jung thought of synchronicity as a non-causal relationship between events in addition to space, time, and causality whereby the world is revealed as a mystery to be interpreted.

The Alchemy of Memoir The year before Sara died we co-authored a self-published memoir titled Turning Darkness into Light . Shortly after Sara died, Katy Butler's article, \"My Father's Broken Heart\" appeared on Fathers' Day in The New York Times Magazine. The article is a memoir of Katy's experience, along with her mother, of her father's doctor pressuring him into getting a pacemaker that kept her father lingering for six years; he died \"too demented to say goodbye or make sense of his suffering. His pacemaker was still ticking.\" Reading the article prompted me to take Katy's memoir workshop at Esalen the first time in October 2010. Her article led to a book contract from Scribner; she finished Knocking on Heaven's Door: A Path to a Better Way of Death last November, to be published in September 2013. It is partly a medical memoir, partly a critique of perverse medical incentives, and partly about the forgotten spirituality of dying. Katy is tall and slender with an aristocratic profile that is a California version of her favorite writer Virginia Woolf; she looks like she hikes in the mountains and sits zazen in her Buddhist practice. Her essay \"Everything if Holy\" expresses a version of \"a religion of no religion.\" She writes: \"The Christian theology I'd been raised with had posited a hierarchical 'great chain of being' with God on top, humans in the middle, and all other creatures and plants arrayed systematically below.\" Yet Dogen (who brought a form of Zen from China to Japan) has a more democratic 'flow of being' in which things in the natural world instruct human beings: \"Walls and fences cannot instruct the grasses and trees to actualize spring, yet they reveal the spiritual without intention, just by being what they are. So too with mountains, rivers, sun, moon, and stars.\" Photo by Cristina TacconeKaty Butler \"My altar holds not only a Buddha, but a seashell, a metal cricket, a snake, and an image of Mary. Likewise, my religious practice now is a hodgepodge of nature worship and Buddhist meditation and twelve-step programs, and I cannot make it all sound logical and consistent.\" - Katy Butler, author and Esalen workshop instructor The last night of the workshop, an artist from Esalen, who took the class, awarded Katy a small replica of The Red Lady saying that she embodies the spirit of Esalen.\"Sometimes I think I'm in the realm of the gods when in reality I'm acting like a hungry ghost.

Crazy Wisdom Bookstore & T ea Room 114 S.

Likewise, nature worship permeated Asian cultures before the Buddha was born.\" Her \"religion\" is eclectic: \"My altar holds not only a Buddha, but a seashell, a metal cricket, a snake, and an image of Mary. Likewise, my religious practice now is a hodgepodge of nature worship and Buddhist meditation and twelve-step programs, and I cannot make it all sound logical and consistent.\" She is an admirer of the British economist E.F. Schumacher's ethos of right livelihood, which she and I discussed several times. She wrote: \"Happiness, his work suggested, was not typified by the ice cream sundae wolfed down alone in front of the television, but by a cookie and a cup of green tea, brewed in awareness and sipped at leisure with friends, while watching the rising moon.\" But she is not an ascetic: \"When I'm tired and or lonely and want to be numb, you can often find me driving alone up Highway 101, feeding the hunger that isn't hunger, stopping at Whole Foods and Costco and Trader Joe's, loading up on Brazilian papayas and toilet paper from the forests of the Northwest and my favorite yogurt from Greece. Sometimes I think I'm in the realm of the gods when in reality I'm acting like a hungry ghost. I forget that there is something in the brain that never hears 'enough.'\" The last night of the workshop last October an artist from Esalen, who took the class, awarded Katy a small replica of The Red Lady saying that she embodies the spirit of Esalen. I've since thought about how that spirit is found in memoir writing as I've come to understand it with Katy's help. In 1976, in an article critical of Esalen in New York magazine, novelist Tom Wolfe wrote: \"The old alchemical dream was changing base metals into gold. The new alchemical dream is changing one's personality \u2014 remaking, remodeling, elevating, and polishing one's very self...and observing, studying, doting on it. (Me!)\" Many outsiders like Wolfe had a misleading image of Esalen as a boutique spa selling narcissistic, apolitical self-love to the white middle class. The memoir workshop title also mentions alchemy: \"Straw into Gold: The alchemy of memoir.\" Wolfe saw the new alchemical dream of self-transformation as an exercise in narcissism, polishing up the self in order to dote on it. One meaning of the memoir version of straw being transformed into gold is to take what one writes in a notebook longhand early each morning and transforming this \"straw\" into the \"gold\" of polished writing through learning the craft and practicing every day. In this way, memoir is no different from yoga or drawing. Memoir also involves a change in the self, though not the one Wolfe caricatures. The second night of class I brought along a copy of Christopher Hitchens' (political journalist, memoirist, atheist) last memoir, Mortality, written while he was in hospital dying of esophageal cancer. Hitchens had just lost his voice to his cancer and I read to the class what he had written about voice and writing. Hitchens told his students: \"Find your own voice.\" Read every composition aloud \"preferably to a trusted friend.\" One's voice is one's idiolect, the unique and idiosyncratic way in which one speaks what one writes. \"Without our corresponding feeling for the idiolect, the stamp on the way an individual actually talks, and therefore writes, we would be deprived of a whole continent of human sympathy, and of its minor-key pleasures such as mimicry and parody.\" Writing a memoir, I felt I was writing a script, a play with a single character \u2014 me. In reading the script aloud to others, I was playing myself as a character. I wanted others to feel personally addressed. Hitchens marvels at how the vocal cords as pieces of gristle produce the chord, \"the resonant vibration that can stir memory, produce music, evoke love, bring tears, move crowds to pity\"; my voice in its uniqueness evokes universal emotions. To paraphrase Alan Watts, becoming your own weird is to become odd in the service of God, although not necessarily the God of theism but God as the universe to which I now voice my connections. \"That which lies at the root of each of us lies at the root of the Cosmos too\" wrote Esalen contributor W.H. Meyers. Not only does the universal arise from the particulars of one's life, the political is seen in the details of the personal. The personal becomes the political. With one's idiosyncratic voice, one can become an authentic player in participatory democracy. That is one reason memoir is currently a popular form of expression in a polarized age in which words and arguments have lost the power to persuade on their own. Voice persuades the lower, emotional parts of the brain to listen and then moves to the higher more cerebral parts; like The Red Lady, memoir touches the ground while artfully reaching upward. Voice is the gold created through the alchemy of practice. It is the currency of cosmic and democratic citizenship. 7. Spirituality and the New Left Returning to Ann Arbor after experiencing Esalen's golden anniversary, I attended a conference celebrating the 50 th anniversary of The Port Huron Statement of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). (To read more coverage of this event, see my essay in Crazy Wisdom Community Journal issue 52, Fall 2012.) I approached the conference seeking connections between the concurrent histories of the West Coast epicenter of the human potential movement and the political hopes that animated the New Left at Port Huron both then and now. Someone remarked that the conference was like a college reunion with seminars. I met with Sharon Jeffrey Lehrer who attended the June 1962 Port Huron meeting of SDS at a U.A.W. camp on Lake Huron. Lehrer remained a political organizer until 1973. Then on a camping trip to Mt. Ranier she had a \"spiritual experience.\" She heard a voice speaking to her: \"But how do you feel in your heart?\" She had no idea. The voice told her to resign from her job as a political organizer. Then, \"Through a series of synchronous events I ended up at the Esalen Institute, a human growth center on an old Indian burial ground on the edge of the Big Sur Coast.\" She wrote: \"Esalen gave me the opportunity to explore territories of the mind and heart I didn't know existed.\" She had ventured outside of her \"familiar political paradigm.\" Lehrer then worked for nonprofits and small businesses as a C.E.O. and consultant for 35 years. I spoke with Leni Wildflower who moderated the panel Women of Port Huron: Reflections on SDS and Change. \"When we were young there seemed to be a chasm at 50 Continued from page 57 \"The old alchemical dream was changing base metals into gold. The new alchemical dream is changing one's personality \u2014 remaking, remodeling, elevating, and polishing one's very self...and observing, studying, doting on it. (Me!)\" - Novelist Tom Wolfe, in a New York magazine piece critical of Esalen in the 70's When asked if he regretted his heavy drinking that may have contributed to his cancer, Christopher Hitchens said that his late night conversations with so many friends, in which \"dull remark would have felt like a physical wound,\" and extra bottles were drunk, were worth it. Looking out over the ocean at Esalen Hitchens marvels at how the vocal cords as pieces of gristle produce the chord, \"the resonant vibration that can stir memory, produce music, evoke love, bring tears, move crowds to pity\"; my voice in its uniqueness evokes universal emotions. Returning to Ann Arbor after experiencing Esalen's golden anniversary, I attended a conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of The Port Huron Statement of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). Christopher Hitchens The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal September - December 2013 Page 59 between activities that could be described as 'changing the world' and those aimed at changing oneself. But not so for the new generation.\" In a chapter on Esalen in her new book, The Hidden History of Coaching , she writes: The Port Huron Statement...expressed a yearning for the same kind of inner expansion that motivated the founders of Esalen. Its authors asserted that 'We regard men [human beings] as infinitely precious and possessed of unfulfilled capacities for reason, freedom, and love.' ...As both the political and human potential movement grew and matured, the apparent rivalries and conflicts seemed less important. The 'politicos' became more interested in issues of life-style, harmony in life, and spiritual principles. And the 'new-agers' were seen to be engaged in pursuits that encompassed cross-cultural exchanges, environmental responsibilities, sexism, and racism. Wildflower's remarks made me think of parallels between SDS and Esalen's human potential movement. Both were rebellions against the stifling conformity of post war America. Both were influenced by the counterculture of the 1950s. Both were subverted by the acid dreams of the counterculture of the 1960s, and then, ironically, were blamed for its excesses. SDS imploded with the rise of the cultish, destructive Weathermen faction. Esalen miraculously survived the wild 1960s without being shut down for drug violations, as Murphy and Price, who were not enthusiasts of the psychedelic scene, feared. Hippies had invaded the place and but were finally run off. At the beginning of the 1970s, Esalen was in the red financially. Their new business manager cracked down and declared: \"This is a business.\" Today Esalen is a thriving non-profit still carrying on the ideas of its founders, yet worried, as it always has, that it could devolve into just another corporate enterprise. Tom Hayden briefly mentions the idea of \"a religion of no religion\" in his recent book The Long Sixties. Of the spirituality of the 1960s counterculture, he writes: At the heart of this new culture was a spirituality, a 'religion of no religion,' an explosion of alternative spiritualities: Liberation theology, ...black liberation theology, ...women's spirituality, ecospirituality, and the revival of Eastern mysticisms rapidly followed. In the face of homophobia, gay, lesbian, and transgender people fought for their spiritual identity. Spanning all these separate outbreaks was a resurgence of the Old Religion, diffusing all of creation with magic and holiness, even if often described and disparaged as paganism.... The 1960s were an era in rebellion against the top-down authority of institutional religion, but they were not an atheistic decade. Instead, the old gods came alive. Hayden uses the term \"religion of no religion\" descriptively to categorize the new spiritualities arising in the 1960s as alternatives to hierarchical religion. By saying that, in the face of homophobia, gay, lesbian, and transgender people fought for their \"spiritual identity,\" he implies that all just pursuits of social justice are fights for spiritual identities: for women, for people of color, for those who are unjustly treated as \"the Other.\" The original Statement's idea of an authentic life requiring the pursuit of social justice is now, after the spiritual reformation of the 1960s, seen as a fight for spiritual identities as well; the authentic life of striving for social justice is now seen as spiritual as well. But is inward spirituality in itself political? Many politicos say no; many \"new-agers\" disagree. But why was there no discussion of religion or spirituality in the Statement of 1962? James Monsonis, then a student at Yale Divinity School, writes in Inspiring Participatory Democracy: The answer is a simple, prosaic, almost laughable one. There was a working group on religious institutions at the meeting, a critique was developed that was to be incorporated into the final draft, and I was delegated to present it to the final, all-night plenary that approved the content of the final draft. And I simply fell asleep before making the report. History is sometimes a series of accidents. As he remembers it, the critique was that religious institutions have generally blessed the status quo , focused only on private morality, were the most segregated institutions in America, and stood for complacency. And what would a positive religious institution look like in a progressive society? It would step back from the pressure of immediate political action. The new Statement would not mention the idea of God; God would be understood as an empowering force propelling individuals to change the world. It would stimulate thought about questions we do not ordinarily consider. It would be a place for camaraderie and enjoyment; in other words, it would be fun. Monsonis cites theologian and Esalen contributor Paul Tillich's idea of religion as being ultimately concerned \u2014 meaning being concerned with the Ultimate \u2014 but emphasizing that being \"concerned\" is not the same as having a final position. The ideal of a positive religion for a progressive society would be, as described here, a pale imitation of Esalen. 8. Conclusion I will not call myself an atheist anymore. It is not because of its intellectual denial of theism. I too reject theism. But I also reject the label atheist as too fraught with associations. One idea behind Frederic Spiegelberg's religion of no religion is that words for religions, and for non-religions, both reveal and conceal. Most people associate atheism with having no morality, or being cold-hearted, or as having no spiritual life. Polls show that only a small percentage of people regard themselves as atheists. But I suspect that there are many who are intellectually atheists but who shun the label because they regard themselves as \"spiritual but not religious,\" as the saying goes. The evolution of religion away from traditional hierarchy is more advanced than polling the number of atheists reveals. And many declared atheists have a rich spiritual life but don't call it that. Christopher Hitchens, like a \"tough guy,\" from the Yiddish word shtarker, \"decided to take whatever my disease can throw at me, and to stay combative even when taking the measure of my inevitable decline.\" He was 61. He wanted an \"unsentimental\" death. He joked that it would be irritating if, after the many prayers for him by religious comrades, he actually pulled through. When asked if he regretted his heavy drinking that may have contributed to his cancer, he said that his late night conversations with so many friends, in which \"dull remark would have felt like a physical wound,\" and extra bottles were drunk, were worth it. This drinking and camaraderie were Hitchens' spiritual sacraments, a spirituality of no spirituality. He was a virtuous heretic who, like all virtuous heretics, religious or scientific, should have a place of honor in a religion of no religion. I think back on Esalen's natural beauty. No monastery belongs there. Esalen's gnosis, its spiritual teaching, is a nature mysticism with no transcendent, personal God. If Christianity was the religion of no religion of ancient Judaism, and the Reformation was the religion of no religion to Catholicism, then nature mysticism is the religion of no religion of all traditional, hierarchical religions. It is not just that God is identical with nature: We, God, and nature are one. Everything is holy. This is one way to read Melville's mystical elevation of Ahab's tear to the greatest treasure in the Pacific. This nature mysticism is expressed in Walt Whitman's radically democratic, pantheistic vision: I have said that the soul is not more than the body,And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is. And: I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars. *** Richard Gull is an emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan. Sources for this article: 1.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 60 AN ESSAY BY LENNY BASS Once again I come to rest in this mystical spruce grove. . . Swaying in the Sangha of Trees : The\"Tree\"Quel FOR THOSE OF YOU who are ardent readers of The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal , you will recall an article published a couple years back written by a mad man who talked with a tree while sitting in a hot tub outside a cabin built by his wife's family in the shadows of the Alleghany Mountains in upstate New York. Well, that mad man is back at it again. The gift of one week of solitude my wife and I afford to one another as our one and only holiday gift has come to pass, and once again I come to rest in this mystical spruce grove. With me are my mat and cushion, a stoic Buddha statue I haul along, and a plethora of pens and thickly stacked writing journals awaiting their inevitable debauchment. My purpose for coming here is just one: to further myself, somehow, on this quest of awakening that I began so long ago and that continues to haunt me all my days. Last time, you may recall (or not, if you didn't read the article), I conveyed a private but very much audible conversation I had with a spruce tree that hangs out just be-tween the hot tub and the cabin's front door. It pierces the night sky and sends wavy evergreen boughs every which way and, seemingly, has a very good brain, to boot. Now, of course, though sometimes I do endow myself with the occasional glass of Chardonnay while sitting in the tub, I know full well that the tree can't speak. There-fore, I translate for it. It speaks in good, full sentences with the common grammati-cal syntax and punctuation marks all aligned correctly, easy enough to understand. Sometimes it even likes to speak with a slight Russian accent, but usually that's when I know it's time to cut off the Chardonnay. And, as well, I've found over the years, it doesn't mince words. For example, last time, under a moonlit sky, we discussed the unique dispositions we each found ourselves in, as well as the relative advantages and disadvantages inherent to each. \"When the storms come,\" it told me, \"you are at a distinct advantage. For you may enter one of your mobility carts [its term for my pick-up truck] and flee. I, on the other hand, have no choice in the matter. I must stay and face the storm.\" \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Yet, fleeing may be the primary human disadvantage. It doesn't promote tenacity or perseverance, both necessary traits in overcoming the so-called obstacles in our path.\" \"True enough,\" it responded. And after a good deal of bantering back and forth, it finally admitted to me the following: \"When the storms come,\" it said, \"we trees sway. This, of course, you can see for yourself. But, did you also know that through this swaying, the soil that cradles our roots is loosened and made more pliable? And with this pliability, our roots are allowed to flourish.\" \"No,\" I replied. \"I did not know that.\" And then after a bit of reflection, I said back to it with great enthusiasm, \"I should like to learn to sway in such a manner! Can you teach me how?\" To this, the tree had a hearty laugh. \"You, sway? What, forever, for?\" I didn't go into great detail with the tree, for I doubted it would understand. But, what I meant was this: All of us face, in some form or another, enormous chal - lenges in the life we are given. More often than not, the sheer magnitude of these challenges make us want to \"get into our mobility carts\" and flee \u2014 whatever our version of that may be. For some, perhaps it is drugs. For others, it may be endless work. And, for others still, literally getting into those \"mobility carts\" and driving far, far away, to better climes, better jobs, better homes and gardens, becomes our answer. It suddenly occurred to me that perhaps we would all be much better served if we simply started learning to sway a little bit more, like the trees do. This, I began to understand, was truly at the root of my meditation practice and a key ingredient, really, to whatever sort of \"awakening\" I believed might be ultimately pending. And ever since, upon my mat and cushion, ever so slightly as to be barely detectable to the naked eye, I do just that. I sway. When I told that to the tree, it just smiled and said, \"Then surely your roots are growing!\" Well, that was a couple years ago, and now I am back to this quiet, rustic retreat sight to \"sway\" some more. Since the time of my last article, a tremendous tornado swept across this sixty-acre enclave. Thankfully, it spared the cabin, as well as my pal, the stalwart spruce tree. But a hundred and fifty less fortunate brethren tree monks lay strewn across the land like a nasty game of pick-up sticks, some twisted and snapped in half, others taken whole from the taproot on up. Walking in to see it for the first time, my heart just shattered. Though most of the thousands of spruces planted here survived, still this was gross negligence of the highest order. I felt sickened and outraged all at once. Since the time of my last article, a tremendous tornado swept across this sixty-acre enclave.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 61 Still...what to say to my tree pal? I shuddered to think of our next conversation. I wanted to offer it a stiff glass of tree booze, whatever that might be, and ask it to please recount the sorry tale. To my amazement and surprise, it seemed quite non-plused by the whole ordeal \u2014 almost giddy, in fact \u2014 and infinitely bemused by the notion that I found it all to be so downright depressing. \"Oh, you mean the 'lumber storm,'\" it responded in a matter-of-fact style upon my inquiry into the matter. It had never heard of the word \"tornado.\" I held back a chortle, thinking it sacrilege to find any humor in this whatsoever. \"Yeah,\" it continued almost nonchalantly, \"board footage for the masses, I guess... but a much better way to go than, say, with the thousand toothed monster. Don't you think?\" By that, I knew it meant the chain saw. Everyone heats with wood out here, and there's almost no time when a chainsaw isn't grinding away somewhere. \"But, why?\" I implored. \"At least the 'monster' doesn't leave twisted carnage in its wake!\" \"Oh, come, come now,\" it responded, rather annoyed by my apparent inanity. \"We talked about this already, didn't we? With the monster, we don't stand a chance, now do we? But a lumber storm? At least there are betting odds out there some-where. And just think of the kind of swaying that those of us who made it went through. Can you imagine? Why, it was root paradise, I tell ya! My own roots were doing a high stepped fandango, dancing with sheer delight! Because of that storm, I'm working on the biggest girth ring I've produced in years! I bet other trees would say the same.\" \"Girth ring?\" I queried. \"Oh, you know...the distance, in circumference, that a tree grows in a year. You can see it as ring lines in a cross section of my trunk.\" \"Sure, sure,\" I said, totally astonished. I'd never thought of it in those terms before, but I had to admit it made sense. And, for a few brief seconds, all my sadness seemed to wash clean away. I kicked back in the tub, raised my glass high in the air and exclaimed, \"To lumber storms, I guess...and happy roots!\" \"Here, here,\" it replied, relieved by my dissipating sadness. We remained quiet a while, each of us pondering the other's perception of the event that had taken place just six months prior. I instantly recoiled at the way my own human perception \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 had interpreted the tragedy before me as something cruel and unwelcome. To the tree, of course, it was naught but a wild and woolly \"growth hormone\" \u2014 with a few sacrificial lambs left in its wake. This stark discrepancy suddenly brought up for me the Buddhist concept of \"I don't know mind.\" For those unfamiliar, \"I don't know mind\" is a kind of Buddhist permis- sion slip, as it were, to the rare admission that we human beings really don't know very much \u2014 about anything! I've found it, over the years, to be as dis - concerting as it is liberating. At the same time, I couldn't help but reflect on the \"perpetrator\" of all this misperception, the quintes-sential element of wind itself. On this wetland pond just outside the cabin door, it seems a renegade con-stant, blowing incessantly to one extreme or another. In winter, it cuts across the great lake, sixty miles due west, and impregnates the area with a seamless barrage of harrowing snow squalls, all carried lov - ingly in its wake. Seldom are the days when the bird feeder, tethered by a rope outside the cabin door, sits motionless. I decided to broach the subject with the tree, to see what wisdom it might have. \"'Course,\" I said, continuing our conversation, \"it seems like the wind is always blowing out here, to one degree or another.\" \"Certainly,\" it replied. And then it added, rather sum- marily, \"Knocking down the mountain, it is.\" \"The mountain?\" not quite understand - ing. \"What mountain?\"\"That mountain,\" it responded, almost bending to- wards the Alleghanies as if to point them out to me. You, who cannot sit still for more than thirty minutes at a stretch...do you really mean to question the insights of a being that has sat in one place for over fifty years solid?I instantly recoiled at the way my own human perception \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 had interpreted the tragedy before me as something cruel and unwelcome. To the tree, of course, it was naught but a wild and woolly \"growth hormone\" \u2014 with a few sacrificial lambs left in its wake. \"\"Continued on page 62 Meagan Duggan, R.Ac The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 62 I gazed out towards the Alleghany Mountains, now barely perceptible against the night sky save for the blinking red flash of a distant cell tower. They always looked just the same to me, dark and mysterious and unchanging. \"Well, that's quite something,\" I said after a while, \"and how, pray tell, do we know this?\" \"We see it,\" it replied, plainly. \"See it?\" I queried. \"Really, now? And just how is it that we presume to see such a phenomenon?\"\"Presume?\" it shot back almost defiantly, catch- ing me off guard. \"You, who cannot sit still for more than thirty minutes at a stretch...do you really mean to question the insights of a being that has sat in one place for over fifty years solid?\" \"No, no,\" I said, quickly recognizing its authority on the matter, \"I wouldn't...I couldn't...it's just that...\" \"Against the fixed point of the night star,\" it continued, glossing over me entirely, \"the mountain has dropped at least half a girth ring since I've been here. Not huge, but noticeable...to one who witnesses things in fifty year increments, that is.\" I opened my mouth to speak, but nothing came out. Could all this be true, what I was hearing and translating out loud? Or was I just making it all up as I went along? It made perfectly logical sense to me that against the fixed point of an unmoving object \u2014 say, the North Star \u2014 that one could chart the relative fluidity of other phenome - na. But a mountain? Dropping half a \"girth ring\"? And how could it be so certain that the wind was responsible? Weren't other explanations plausible? Humans, as well, cause erosion, don't they? I decided to raise the topic with the tree. \"Okay,\" I said, \"I'll grant your assertion that the mountain is dropping. But how do you know that the wind is responsible? Maybe it's rainwater, or human impact, or a thousand other plausible explanations.\"\"Oh, it's the wind,\" it replied with complete confidence. \"No doubt about it. For, can you name something more powerful than a gentle, persistent wind across the annals of time? No...you cannot. Lumber storms may knock down individual trees, in a radical display of power. But a gentle, persistent wind? Nothing \u2014 not even a mountain \u2014 can withstand that. One fine day, if your species happens to survive long enough, someone of your ilk will fix their gaze upon yon mountain, and all they will see is high-grassed prairie, far as the eye can see. Of this, you can mark my words.\" Again, I sat back in the tub, this time staring straight up to the heavens taking in what the tree had said. Something about it brought a strange, inexplicable sense of calm to me. Suddenly, it was as if this great weight lifted off my chest allowing me to breathe again, as if for the very first time since I'd gotten there. \"A gentle, persistent wind will knock down a mountain,\" I repeated over and over, as if it were a mantra. And then, it hit me. Suddenly, in my mind's eye, I saw this enormous mountain. And it was filled to the brim with all the ingredients of my own ego \u2014 my identity attachments, my habit energies, my false hopes and dreams, my illu - sions of grandeur. On and on it went, all packed tightly together in a solid clump of dense matter heaved high into the heavens, as far as the eye could see. And just what was it that I was trying to accomplish out there, during this extraordinary week of solitude? The answer was simple: take it all down, in one terrific \"tornadic\" fell swoop! One enormous medita-tive gust, and the mountain would crumble, just like that! What utter rubbish! Not only that, but I realized that this had always been my strategy, all the years I'd been coming there. And then, of course, the pattern would be that I would return back home only to be knocked back down to earth in, like, thirty seconds flat. Some triggering event would plant itself like a land mine along the trenches of my house-holder life...and kablooie, the whole thing would blow up. And then, oh, how the self-loathing would start. The week was worthless and pointless and a waste of time. All the work done there was for naught, and this despicable wretch of a human would never approach something akin to awakening no matter how hard he tried! But now, repeating this mantra over and over again in my head, it was as if I had twisted the kaleidoscope slightly and saw a whole new pattern emerge with fresh, clean eyes. Tornados do not take down mountains. And a one-week intensive medi-tation retreat does not an \"enlightenment\" produce. But...a gentle, persistent wind, working slowly, little by little, across vast expanses of time and space...not even a mountain can withstand this. And a meditation practice, done gently, patiently, with persistence across that same vast expanse of time and space? Maybe, just maybe, it might actually result in something akin to an awakening. The key, however, is to elongate the scope of expectation...to something just this side of forever. This, however, is not something many of us want to hear. We want to resolve our issues quickly and get on with the business of inexorable happiness and delight without further adieu. There must be a shortcut, somewhere. Maybe this intensive retreat, or that. Maybe this enlightened guru with their litany of parlor tricks, or that new fangled esoteric approach. But, turns out, there is no shortcut through. And to think so only adds unnecessary suffering to what is a difficult road already. What a relief it was for me, then, to see my meditation practice as a gentle, persistent wind knocking down a mountain! That it was just as important to not overdo the prac-tice as it was to keep it from falling into disarray. Somewhere in the middle, on this middle path, would be just about right. I turned my attention back to the tree in order to express my gratitude for our little private exchange. \"Thank you,\" I said to it. \"You've helped me to understand something that I didn't understand before.\" \"Really?\" it replied. \"And what, pray tell, is that?\" I tried to think in terms the tree could fathom. Finally, I said, \"I, too, may have dropped 'half a girth ring' since I arrived here. But, those high grassed prairies...they are still a long way off.\" To this, the tree just smiled. I thought perhaps it didn't understand. But then it shot back, \"Keep swaying, dear human...just keep swaying.\" And, somehow, I knew it did.

A little power cleaning and a few sprays of a fresh scent might seem like a great way to start anew. But before you pull out the disinfectant or plug in the pine mountain scent, think about what may be sealed up inside the house with you and your family. Our houses are filled with potentially dangerous substances. While performing everyday tasks, such as cleaning or scenting the air, we may release harmful chemicals. And without exposure to sunlight or other elements, these chemicals do not break down. They stick around. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has found that levels of pollutants, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can be hundreds times higher indoors than outdoors. VOC levels in the average home are two to five times higher than in the air outside. The good news is we do not have to compromise our health to have a clean home that smells fresh. A few easy changes can improve your indoor environment so you have a truly fresh, clean start, knowing neither you nor your children or friends are breathing in the bad stuff. Cleaning Products Avoid cleaners and other household products tattooed with \"Danger\" or \"Poison.\" The EPA has identified these products as highly toxic, meaning a few drops to a teaspoon could kill the average person. Products labeled with \"Warning\" are considered moderately toxic (a teaspoon to an ounce is lethal). Slightly toxic products contain the word \"Caution\" (over one ounce is lethal). But remember, even some of the milder cleaning products are still labeled with \"Caution\" since they are not meant to go on the skin or in the eyes. The word \"Flammable\" on the label indicates the product may contain VOCs (volatile organic compounds). \"Organic\" in this case means carbon-based. Since carbon burns, many VOC-containing products are flammable. VOCs are \"volatile\" because they evaporate readily at room temperature. VOCs are common in household products like cleansers, disinfectants, degreasers, furniture oil, spot remover, rug cleaners, and air fresheners. These products may contain over one hundred different VOCs, such as formaldehyde, benzene, acetone, and trichloroethylene, with an average of 17 VOCs per product. Exposure to VOCs could result in a headache, irritation of the eyes, nose, or throat, as well as trouble concentrating. More pronounced reactions can include dizziness, lack of coordination, stomach pains, worsened asthma symptoms, and even an increased risk of developing childhood asthma. According to the EPA, some VOCs \"...are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in humans.\" Dozens of VOCs are classified as toxic or hazardous under U.S. federal laws yet are generally not listed on product labels. Opt for products that list their ingredients. And look for words you can pronounce, like citric acid, acetic acid, sodium bicarbonate, coconut oil, and vegetable glycerin \u2014 not hazardous chlorine bleach or polyethylene glycol (linked to cancer and reproductive harm), 2-butoxyethanol (a suspected neurotoxicant and blood, liver, and kidney toxicant), DMDM hydantoin or triclosan (both linked to cancer). Or make your own with ingredients like baking soda, vinegar, and liquid castile soap. It's a great way to save money and cut down on the number of products stored in under the sink. Air Fresheners Synthetic air fresheners, including sprays, plug-ins, fragranced candles, scented oils, and perfumed potpourri literally pump harmful VOCs into the air. In addition, in order to dissolve and stabilize solutions, synthetic fragrances commonly contain phthalates (thal-ates), a class of chemicals linked to birth defects, asthma, and allergies. Instead of masking an offensive odor, try using baking soda, vinegar, or the mineral zeolite to absorb odors. Regarding VOCs in air fresheners, cleaners, and personal care products, Claudia Miller, an allergist and immunologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio says, \"The best smell is no smell.\" CandlesBesides avoiding synthetic fragrances in candles, look for beeswax, soy or palm oil wax, which last longer and burn cleaner than paraffin (petroleum) wax. And be aware of vague terms such as \"soy-based.\" This claim could mean that the product still contains paraffin wax, synthetic fragrance, and other chemicals. Simple Solutions Ventilate \u2014 If possible, especially while using potentially harmful products. Newer homes (those built in the 1970s or after) are more air tight than older homes. Just cracking open the windows on mildly warm days helps. Read Labels \u2014 Use household products that are less toxic or non-toxic. Avoid products labeled with \"Danger\" and \"Poison\" and \"Flammable.\" Try to stick with products that have simple and fewer ingredients. Do it Yourself \u2014 Make a soft scrub paste with 1/4 cup baking soda, 3 tablespoons liquid castile soap, and 1 tablespoon water. Or use a 50/50 solution of white vinegar and water as a disinfecting spray. Unplug \u2014 Stop using scented plug-ins and synthetic fragrances. Remember: Baking soda and vinegar absorb odors instead of masking them. Freshen the Air Naturally \u2014 Try these: R eal evergreen swags and wreaths release fresh woodsy smells. Or ange and clove pomanders give off a warm spice and citrus smell. To make, simply poke small holes into an orange (knitting needles or thin nails work well) and fill the holes with cloves. Hang with a ribbon. Boil cinnamon s ticks, cloves, or a dried-up pomander on the stove (do not leave unattended). T opiaries of r osemary or Meyer lemon trees fill a room with invigorating aromas. Bak e! Whether made from scratch or a box, pies, muffins, and other baked goods always make a house smell inviting. Use essen tial oils . Add 10 to 20 drops of your favorite natural essential oil to an 8-ounce spray bottle of distilled water. Common houseplan ts, such as English ivy, peace lily, spiderplant, and others, absorb indoor air pollutants.

He was a special presence in our small, Midwestern university city. In some towns and cities, it is a businessman, banker, publisher, university president or a famous author or scientist who is the de facto leader of the community. In Ann Arbor, it was Karl Pohrt. Karl founded and led Shaman Drum Bookshop from 1982 until it closed in 2009. He created the Ann Arbor Book Festival, served on the Boards of the American Book Association, the Great Lakes Booksellers Association, and the Downtown Development Authority, and was the former Board Chairman of the State Street Area Association. The Karl Pohrt Distinguished University Professor of Contemporary History Chair was named in his honor, an exceedingly rare tribute, bestowed by the U-M academic community. He hosted hundreds upon hundreds of author events over the years, and if you were an academic at the university, and also an author, you could count on Shaman Drum to herald the arrival of your latest work. At the same time, his originality of mind brought a unique and progressive voice to the civic boards he served on, so he also made his impact felt on the cityscape, and on the ethical climate of this city. He asked the right questions, and he articulated communitarian values that came to hold sway. He was a civic and intellectual leader without equal in this town over the last 30 years. Though a full half year has passed since his death, his contributions to the life of our city over the last generation were singular and important. We are publishing two essays about Karl. One is by Richard Gull, a long-time friend of Karl's and an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Michigan; the other is by Rev. Joe Summers, the Vicar of the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation on Lohr Road. Reflections Given by Rev. Joe Summers at the Memorial Service for Karl Pohrt on July 14, 2013, at the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation (Readings: Isaiah 61:1-3, Isaiah 25:6-9, The Heart Sutra, & John 1:1-17) O God, from whom to be turned is to fall, to whom to be turned is to rise, and in whom to stand is to abide forever. Grant us in all our duties your help, in all our perplexities your guidance, in all our dangers your protection, and in all our sorrows your peace. Through Jesus Christ our Lord, our Body, and our Blood, our Life and our Nourishment. Amen. (Prayer of St. Augustine) \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" That opening of the gospel of John was one of Karl's favorite Bible verses. While a graduate student in the American Culture program at the University of Michigan, Karl took a class on \"The Word\" which was co-taught by three professors: one Christian, one Buddhist, and one Jewish. The class met in the Modern Languages building. While on the way to class one day, Karl turned the corner and came across the body of a young woman who had just committed suicide by jumping out of the Bell Tower. Karl stood there stunned. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Most people simply walked past without seeming to acknowledge what had happened. One person threw their coat over her head. When the police came they immediately started taking photos. No one stopped to acknowledge the death of this human being through words, or prayers, or holding in silence. For Karl, it all felt incredibly crass and dehumanizing and helped frame his understanding of how important it is for us to be able to acknowledge and speak to the great mystery of human existence. \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth, and we beheld its glory.\" At the heart of John's gospel is a vision of the joy of how the eternal becomes incarnate here and now in human flesh and human history, in Jesus, and in us. I've found myself struggling to articulate why Karl was so beloved to me and to so many of us. One of my father's favorite preachers' anecdotes was about a preacher going on and on in a funeral sermon about how wonderful the dead man had been until finally the man's widow nudged her son and said \"Boy \u2014 go up and look in the casket and make sure it's your pappy up thar.\" I don't want us to demean Karl by losing the richness of the complexity of who he was, so before I talk about his many great qualities, I want to acknowledge some of the less great qualities that were also such a vital part of who he was. Yesterday's Los Angeles Times quotes one friend describing Karl as \"one of the most well adjusted people I ever met.... he exuded a certain calm and ease with the world that touched everyone who ever met him.\" I think that's for the most part true, but Karl could also be really temperamental. Just as his joy and enthusiasm were really out there and infectious, so too, when he was in a bad mood, he became like one of those cartoon characters who has a black cloud following behind them. He could have an amazing temper. First he would get paler and paler and then you would see the blood rise up in his face like a volcano. It would happen if somebody was being abusive, or just really impolite or demeaning to others, or if they were avoiding taking responsibility for their actions or inaction. It could also happen when Karl felt cut off from others. Sometimes fighting was part of his way back into connection with those he loved. Karl could be obstinate \u2014 incredibly so. If he had an emotional reaction to something, or he didn't want to deal with something, he could be pretty unmovable. He was excellent at procrastinating. He told me about a critical moment in the life of the bookshop when he finally found the courage to show Dianne what he, perhaps exaggeratingly, said was a two to three-foot high stack of mail he had been hiding because he was embarrassed by the fact that he couldn't keep up with it. And saying that, let's be clear the success of Shaman Drum was partly about Karl's incredible love of books, but it was also about his coming to realize that he needed to surround himself with people who were good at doing all the many things he wasn't good at doing. Part of the beauty and power of Shaman Drum was that it was the achievement of a community of incredible workers. They were also a key part of the joy of hanging out there. So Karl would be the first to acknowledge that he was radically imperfect, but at the same time, for many of us he was a kind of sacrament \u2014 a material means of grace. I don't think I've ever known a human being who I found to be more encouraging. He gave you the courage to be truthful, humble, kind, serious, playful, and adventuresome \u2014 and in his presence all those qualities seemed to go hand in hand. I experienced grace upon grace through Karl.He was such a source of delight for me. My heart would lift whenever I saw him. Karl really felt like my beloved. I think it's significant because he loved so many things and people that he inspired me to love with a similar abandon. If you think about Just as his joy and enthusiasm were really out there and infectious, so too, when he was in a bad mood, he became like one of those cartoon characters who has a black cloud following behind them.He gave you the courage to be truthful, humble, kind, serious, playful, and adventuresome \u2014 and in his presence all those qualities seemed to go hand in hand Karl in front of Shaman DumThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 65 the list of things Karl loved, and the many people he loved (as is reflected here today and in the many people who couldn't be here today), it is amazing. Among other things, Karl had a profound love for literature, poetry, film, TV, theater, anthropology, religion, philosophy, politics, history, psychology \u2014 and in each of those areas Karl loved many, many specific writers, thinkers, and works of art. Karl loved music, dancing and sexuality. He loved community. He loved great conversations. And Karl gave himself over to the things and people he loved in such a way that he seemed to create real relationships with all of them. Karl's way of creating relationship with things and people reminds me of Walt Whitman's \"Song of the Open Road.\" Like Whitman, he relished this magnificent mystery we find ourselves in. There was something so open and appreciative, an almost physical desire to know the world and people in a deep way that it reminds me of the Hebrew word Yada, which both means to know and to have intercourse (sex) with. Karl gladly embraced a multiplicity of contradictions in a way few of us do. I loved Karl's appreciative chuckle whenever I would call up asking for Carlos the Jackal, or the mutual joy we took in action movies. Both of us came from inner city high schools and enjoyed imagining ourselves as the badass dudes we never were. I love the joy Karl took in fighting injustice \u2014 and sticking it to the man. One of my favorites of Karl's stories was the time the F.B.I. pulled him out of teaching a class at the University of Michigan in Flint to interview him about the whereabouts of his former friends who had become part of the Weather Underground \u2014 only to have Karl tell them they would never find them \u2014 because they were so stupid. I loved Karl's profound commitment to trying to help to create a better world, a world with less suffering, less injustice, a world where the dignity of each would be respected, a world where human creativity and culture flourish. I love the joy Karl took in being a businessman and a pillar of the community. Karl understood the price of community and what it takes to sustain a healthy and vibrant community and he was willing to pay the price. He embraced all those things that the socially concerned aren't supposed to be concerned about like making a business profitable. He was totally willing to step in and do the unglamorous stuff, whether it was wheeling people in and out of chemo sessions when he was a conscientious objector working in the hospital, or sitting with a friend who was dying, or doing the often boring work of going to meetings. He even served as the lay leader of this congregation. And the joy Karl took in words, literature, and poems \u2014 almost always when he spoke \u2014 about a book or a poem or a movie \u2014 I found myself opening within and being able to see and appreciate whatever insight he had such that it became part of me. Since Karl could love some pretty insane things \u2014 that could take you on quite a journey. I also loved Karl's deep commitment to the practice of inner silence and the life beyond the ego that he learned through studying and practicing Buddhism. Being grounded in silence is the only way words become living and vibrant rather than stale and dead. \"Grace upon grace\" \u2014 Karl had such a way of forging a real relationship with you that you felt honored to be called his friend, his co-worker, his associate, his brother. You knew he really valued you. My song of Karl is a song of deep, deep thanks for being such a wonderful co-worker, friend, and brother. *for being so open, receptive, and appreciate, giving me permission to become more so *for loving so fiercely that he helped me claim my own ferocious love*for being a song of praise \u2014 even here and now amidst so much suffering and so much that is crass and dehumanizing The night he died I told Karl how I had heard David Byrne live for the first time the night before at the Michigan Theater. There is a Talking Head's song that Byrne played that night that's been going through my head ever since. It goes: I got a girlfriend that's better than that She has the smoke in her eyes She's moving up, going right through my heart She's gonna give me surprise...Stop making sense, stop making sense, stop making sense, making sense I got a girlfriend that's better than that and nothing is better than this, is it? Karl had a way of moving right up through your heart by continually surprising you, waking you up to whatever reality you hadn't seen or been dull to. What could be better than that? Amen Part of the beauty and power of Shaman Drum was that it was the achievement of a community of incredible workers. They were also a key part of the joy of hanging out there.Karl had a way of moving right up through your heart by continually surprising you, waking you up to whatever reality you hadn't seen or been dull to.

Dena Bow en Richard Gull Reflects on Karl Pohrt's Life, His Religions, and Their Last Lunch By Richard Gull Karl Pohrt died last July 10. He was well known in Ann Arbor as founder and owner of Shaman Drum Bookshop and as a political and spiritual leader. He was a fellow staff writer for the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal and a long-time friend. Sometime after Karl was diagnosed with cancer in October 2013, I wrote to him: The prospect of losing you is daunting but maybe there is hope. We have known each other since New Years Eve 1966 when we met at a party in Flint. You were 19; I was 27. You were a student of mine in a philosophy class in 1968. Years later on my 70 th birthday you told me that back then you learned in my class that \"the world of ideas can be really cool.\" In the 60's we were political activists, often together, from \"Getting Clean for Gene McCarthy,\" going door-to-door in the 1968 Wisconsin primary, to attending an early meeting of the radical Weathermen faction at an old ballroom on North Saginaw St. in Flint at the end of 1969. I attended your wedding to Dianne in 1973. You became a colleague in the late 70's, teaching English as an adjunct at U-M Flint. You founded Shaman Drum Books in 1980 and became a creative force on the Ann Arbor scene. We remained friends throughout many changes, fellow refugees from the post-industrial city to the bookish university culture of Ann Arbor. Shaman Drum became one of the best independent bookstores in the country. It was a community, bringing town and gown together. You were honored in numerous ways. I remember the huge fake conference on \"The Book in Ann Arbor\" at Rackham in 1990 that was a ruse to get you to a surprise 10 th anniversary celebration of the Drum. You were awarded a framed poster of Arnold Schwarzenegger from The Terminator. You always encouraged my creativity and through the years we have shared many drafts of our writings. We've been having lunch regularly for decades. Two years ago you explained to me how to do interviews and now we are both staff writers for the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal . I just returned from a writing seminar at Esalen last week, which is celebrating its 50 th anniversary. At the end of the month, I'm attending the conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Port Huron Statement. I'm going to write an article on the New Left and the New Age. I'll want your suggestions. If you leave now, if God takes you, it is happening at a moment when our friendship is in full flower, a moment when it has never meant more to me in all of its 45 years. We have so much more to say to each other. I dearly love you Karl, Richard Shortly after this note Karl began chemotherapy; he never saw my completed article before he died. It was inspired by his own article about traveling to the town of Phil Campbell in northern Alabama with Habitat for Humanity to help repair tornado damage (CW Issue 52, Dec. 2012). Karl had an epiphany there: he did not understand the born-again theology of the people he met. For Karl, \"Religious understanding is a form of knowledge that requires a great deal of practice and attention.\" He likened Buddhist meditation to a gradual ripening, a \"biological unfolding,\" and not a leap of faith. Yet he regarded his own lack of understanding as \"a gift.\" He quoted a Zen master who said to his student: \"Like this cup you are full of opinions. How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?\" Like the Zen student, Karl thought his understanding of the born-agains was limited by his preconceptions. He thought his lack of understanding called for deep attention, for there is something about oneself to be learned from this. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 66 Continued from page 65He wrote of the power of Raven \"whose energy is a precise and specific kind of deep attention.\" He was moved by Abraham Anghik Ruben's sculpture Migration: Umiak with Spirit Figures at the Museum of the Native American on his first trip to Bethesda for chemotherapy. A month before his death, we went out for lunch even though Karl was in hospice care at home. He had lost his hair to chemotherapy, walked with a cane, and now looked older than his 65 years. He told me he had just read anthropologist T.M. Luhrmann's book When God Talks Back: Understanding the American Evangelical Relationship with God (Vintage, 2012). He said that this was \"a smart, smart book\" on the evangelicals. Clearly Karl was still giving deep attention to his lack of understanding back in Phil Campbell, Alabama. He said of his impending exit: \"I'm O.K. with dying, but I regret leaving a little early.\" He said that it is hard to believe that there is nothing more beyond death and that he thought of death as a \"migration\" and not a termination. In the weeks after our lunch, I gave deeper attention to Karl's religions. He attended a small Presbyterian Church growing up, later became interested in Buddhism, and began practicing meditation over thirty years ago. He then became a practicing Christian again as well. He wrote in his blog: \"I know that this may be theologically complicated, but it is what I am. As Walt Whitman says: 'I am multitudes.'\" Buddhist meditation's taking heed not to squander one's life diverted from the present by anxieties of the past and future was the kind of seriousness Karl admired. He wrote: \"It is Buddhism's version of that Old Time religion.\" For Karl, Buddhism is about the impermanence of human existence and Christianity's central message is practicing \"large and small kindnesses\" towards one's neighbor as exemplified by the story of the Good Samaritan. But, he asked, \"Why do I need to label this according to specific religious ideas? It is really the truth about what it is to be human.\" Karl quoted novelist and essayist James Baldwin, who was not a Buddhist, poetically uniting human impermanence (Buddhism) and interdependence (Christianity) in one passage:For nothing is fixed, forever and forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down the rock. Generations do not cease to be born, and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have. Baldwin's passage shows that uniting Buddhism and Christianity may be theologically complex but poetically simpler; it also shows that Karl's religious pluralism included humanism grounded in the humanities that is not an alternative to religion but is enhanced by religious experience and language.

From the Collection of Sprott Asset Management, with permission of the artist.Like the Zen student, Karl thought his understanding of the born-agains was limited by his preconceptions. He thought his lack of understanding called for deep attention... He said that it is hard to believe that there is nothing more beyond death and that he thought of death as a \"migration\" and not a termination. He was moved by Abraham Anghik Ruben's sculpture Migration: Umiak with Spirit Figures at the Museum of the Native American on his first trip to Bethesda for chemotherapy. Karl with Allen Ginsberg\"What have you been reading?\" Karl asked. I said I had just read Bertrand Russell's 1932 essay on Aldous Huxley titled \" Brave New World : We Don't Want To Be Happy.\" In Huxley's pleasure-oriented dystopia, children are \"conditioned\" not to fear death by being taken to hospitals and given sweets as they watch patients die. \"Huxley's point is like Zen,\" said Karl. \"Self-determination requires the experience of suffering.\" I said: \"Your blog contains humor about your cancer and chemo but doesn't sugar-coat death. You wrote: 'I wouldn't recommend chemotherapy as a weight loss plan, but I've lost thirty pounds since I got sick.' Or when you said that it was either pay for plane tickets to get chemo in Bethesda at the National Cancer Institute or buy a shovel. Your humor draws people in and shows your spirit.\" \"Thanks, man,\" he said. Driving Karl back home, I said: \"I remember at one of your parties in the early 90's, you were dancing wildly to Prince and said: 'He's a fuckin' genius!' That young African-American writer Tour\u00e9 said that, for Prince, Jesus was underneath that music.\" Karl said: \"And here all this time I thought it was sex underneath there.\" In his driveway we hugged. \"I love you, Karl.\" Karl said: \"I've loved knowin' you, man.\" Karl had maintained his blog \"thereisnogap\" throughout his illness. Recently I looked again at his final post on May 10, 2013. There is a photo of Karl in Manali, India, in 1994 in sunglasses looking quite cool standing in front of a seedy hotel under its sign that read \"Hotel Karma.\" He wrote: \"A few days ago I had a seizure that the doctors discovered was due to three small brain tumors. I've decided to end this blog \u2014 to exit the Hotel Karma (at least for the time being) \u2014 while I'm still in sound mind and body.\" I was reminded of an essay Karl sent to me years ago in which he described seeing a dead, mummified monk sitting zazen displayed in a glass case somewhere in Thailand. Sunglasses had been placed over the monk's eyes to cover the empty sockets. Karl wrote that the mummified monk looked very cool \u2014 and very dead. ###We remained friends throughout many changes, fellow refugees from the post-industrial city to the bookish university culture of Ann Arbor.Besides Buddhism and Christianity, Karl's Whitmanesque multitude included strong ethical commitments to political action to heal the world, and to institution building. And Karl had a fierce work ethic. It also included his knowledge of Native American culture and his reverence for the natural world. Commenting on the novel The Echo Maker by Richard Powers about Sand Hill Cranes in Nebraska, Karl wrote that the protagonist's pathological condition of not being able to recognize human faces is a powerful metaphor for the loss of the human ability to decipher nature's languages. He quoted Powers' biblically poetic description of our fallen state: \"When animals and people spoke the same language, crane calls said exactly what they meant. Now we live in unclear echoes.\" We have turned away from the hard task of relearning the lost language of cranes in favor of our own self-centered comfort. Karl wrote: \"I am terribly worried about the world my grandchildren will inherit.\" Esalen in Big Sur, California, is a long distance geographically and spiritually from Phil Campbell, Alabama. But I had an epiphany at Esalen not unlike Karl's back in Phil Campbell (see article, page 52). Karl thought of his failure to understand born-again theology as a gift, as a call for deeper attention to see beyond his preconceptions. Esalen, for me, was similarly the beginning of a deeper understanding of American spirituality and its roots. Secular people often dismiss born-agains as bumpkins; those who are impatient with talk about the new spirituality often dismiss Esalen as self-indulgent New Age craziness. Preconceptions mask a deeper understanding. Through writing about Esalen, I came to see Karl's spiritual pluralism in a new way. For Karl, like Michael Murphy and Richard Price, the founders of Esalen, religion should enhance the unfolding of human potential. Like them, Karl created an institution that was an incarnation of his ideals. And as with Esalen's nature mysticism, Karl regarded nature as objectively sublime. And he shared their vision of spiritual reformation, a democratic ethic that exceeded mere tolerance of other religions by calling for deeper understanding as well. Other religions were to be understood on their own terms, approached humbly with deep attention to what they can teach us while respecting their complexity, unlike the so-called New Atheists of recent times, who dismiss religion as superstition and ignorance. At their best religions are complex responses to fundamental aspects of the human condition. At lunch, Karl told me that he had neuropathy in his feet, legs, and hands. He knew that I suffered from this condition myself. I reached over and took his hands in mine. \"Weird feeling isn't it,\" I said. \"It's a combination of numbness and internal inflammation.\" I had never held Karl's hands before. They felt bigger and stronger than I had expected. We looked into each other's eyes. He told me that he had three brain tumors, and spots on his kidneys and spine, and felt his abilities slipping. I squeezed his hands; I was speechless.

LIBERTY 734-668-TIME MICHTHEATER.ORGThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 68 By Monica Turenne, D.V.M. Death is not an easy topic. No one likes to talk about it, even when it's regarding pets. As a veterinarian, I believe the reason pe t parents do not like to talk about death is fear of the unknown. Perhaps they had a bad experience in the past or heard terrible stories from friends, but whatever the case, they are left with a lot of tough questions. What will it be like? Will my pet suffer? When will it happen? Will it be awful? So when our pets become terminally ill, it can become overwhelming. This is when in-home hospice can play such an important role in helping your pet and your family. Let me introduce you to Max:Max was a 10-year-old dachshund. He was diagnosed with lymphoma in July 2013. His pet parents elected not to pursue chemotherapy, but they also did not want to euthanize him yet. They asked me to come to their home for a hospice consultation and to create a hospice plan for them. Max was so sweet and so happy when I met him! He was even sticking his head into my doctor's bag to get treats. I collaborated with his parents to create a plan, and over the following four weeks, Max was kept comfortable on various oral medications. During the last 10 days of his life, we followed his hospice plan, made several home repeat examinations, and gave subcutaneous fluids and injectable anti-nausea medications to keep Max comfortable until he was truly ready to die. Then, one day, his pet mom called me and said that he was ready, and they were ready. I went to their home and indeed saw a little dog lying on the laps of his four women (mother and three daughters). Max was peaceful and resting comfortably. He was where he was meant to be, when he was meant to be there. When I graduated from veterinary school 15 years ago, it was my vision to care for dogs and cats through every stage of life \u2014 from puppy and kitten-hood to the end of their lives. Part of that process included helping pet parents with their terminally ill animals. But I found that I had a limited ability to help during that stage of life. In many cases, I had very little to offer when I delivered grim diagnoses in an examination room. I could recommend expensive diagnostics or refer them to specialists. If neither was feasible, the only other option I could offer was euthanasia, either right then or in the very near future. I always felt there had to be something better I could offer. Why wasn't there something that might allow their pet to experience a pain-free, comfortable, and good quality of life until either the time was right for euthanasia or the pet died naturally at home? Why weren't there other options that would allow pet parents to spend quality time with their pet? When I learned about hospice for pets, I realized that it was exactly what was missing! What exactly is pet hospice? Generally speaking, the goal of pet hospice is to offer the best possible quality of life for animals who have terminal illnesses or who are at their natural end of life. Pet hospice provides pets with palliative relief from pain, nausea, discomfort, and other symptoms that may occur. These measures may take the form of oral medications, injections, herbs, acupuncture, massage, or other treatments. Hospice care strives to help not only the pet, but also the pet parents, by helping them prepare for the death of their pet. We help owners make difficult decisions regarding medical intervention and aftercare. We want them to understand the process so that when the time is at hand, they do not need to make decisions based on fear or quick judgment. While there is tremendous sadness and grief during this time, hospice has the potential to help pet parents manage this process and care for their pets. Many people have found deep meaning by fully experiencing this time with their pet. A hospice plan is the next step to alleviate some of the stress and fear. The pet parent and their hospice veterinarian create a hospice plan. It is very comprehensive and serves as a guide for the pet parent, so that when times of crises occur, the pet parent is prepared because the situation has already been anticipated and discussed. The types of situations that are covered in a hospice plan might include: What are the pet parents' primary concerns? This could be anything from lack of appetite, to pain or discomfort, or to the question: What will I do when my pet can no longer go outside to urinate? What is the living arrangement of the pet? This might include where the pet sleeps or eats. Is the current setup feasible, or should it be modified given the current or future health status of the pet? A house-call veterinarian can be very helpful with this because he or she can directly observe the environment and recommend any changes. What are the pet parents' wishes regarding medical intervention? For example, what would the pet parent prefer to do if their pet stops eating? Do they want to intervene with medications, or do they prefer to let their pet guide the process? Do the pet parents prefer euthanasia or natural death for their pet? If they prefer euthanasia, would they prefer an in-home euthanasia, or would they prefer to go to their primary veterinarian? What are the plans for aftercare? Does the pet parent prefer a general cremation (when ashes are not returned) or private cremation (when their pet's ashes are returned)? Or perhaps they prefer a burial at a pet cemetery? What are the wishes for a memorial service? Some pet parents would like to have a service but are not sure what to do. The hospice veterinarian can assist in generating ideas to help the pet parent prepare. It is amazing what beautiful and creative ideas can be created when pet parents just simply talk about their love for, and devotion to, their pets. As you can imagine, these discussions are not easy. However, they can be very important in making the end-of-life process as smooth and as comfortable as possible for the parents and their pet. In-home hospice is a gift that we can give to our pets, and it is becoming better known among pet parents. While the grief and the sadness are so real, hospice can help to give our pets and their families comfort, love, support, and quality time.

By Nieka Apell The Crow Who Was Not Asked to Stay A Children's Book by Susan Scott Morales \"It's about making sure you know you can change your mind about someone. That even if you think you don't like someone or that someone is annoying to you, you might later find something good about them,\" explained a nine-year-old reader of The Crow Who Was Not Asked to Stay, the new children's book by Ann Arbor author Susan Scott Morales. The storyline of Morales' book seems deceptively simple. A crow and three robins visit the narrator's home. While she invites the robins to stay and provides them with a birdfeeder, she decides she does not like the crow and tries unsuccessfully to get rid of him, calling him a \"pest\" and a \"squawker\" and observing that, \"It's hard, I know, to like everyone.\" Although she pleads with the crow to leave her alone, and even shoos him away with a broom, the crow steadfastly refuses to go. One day, however, a hawk comes to her yard, threatening the robins and their nest of babies, and the crow chases away the predator. The narrator comes to appreciate the crow's beauty and bravery, admitting, \"That pest and I are best friends today.\" Although the plot is straightforward and accessible to children as young as three, the underlying metaphors can be variously interpreted by older children and adults, as well. \"Little kids like it for the literal meaning of the story and for the poetry of the language,\" said Morales. \"At the same time, eleventh graders are using it in their poetry units.\" The book has also found an audience among grandparents who \"particularly love reading this book because it is written from the perspective of an older, wiser woman,\" Morales said. She has also been told by therapists that they are using her book with adult clients to explore the layers of metaphor. Morales said that the earliest beginnings of the book came to her one day in her own driveway. \"One day, I suddenly saw three birds, maybe robins, and one crow. The words 'three robins and a crow came to my home' came into my head. This often happens to me with poetry: one line comes to me and the rest follows later. I just started playing with it and it turned into 'a crow and three robins came to my home,' which became the first line of the book,\" she explained. The writers' group Morales participates in was working with a poet on villanelles, a nineteen-line form of poetry. \"It's an intimidating structure to work with,\" said Morales. \"It is very structured, but it also leads to developing themes that have repetition through the verses.\" As her poem developed, Morales read it to her four-year-old grandson. \"I noticed that he laughed out loud at a couple of lines,\" she said. \"When I said, 'I cawed, you're in no-crow zone' and when I called the crow a 'pest,' he thought it was very funny. That made me start thinking about my poem more in terms of kids and what they might take from it.\" Not long after, Morales overheard her grandson talking to himself, reciting the first and last stanzas of the poem from memory. \"He'd only heard it that one time,\" she said. \"That made me think that there is music to these lines and that I needed to keep exploring them.\"A talented writer at the Bear River Writers' Conference helped Morales further develop the meter in her poem to improve the musicality. She then found illustrator Seth Saint Pierre, also a Michigan resident. \"He just got my poem,\" she said. \"He understood it and his illustrations add so much to it. His color choices are so appropriate and so appealing.\" The images are created in warm purples and the cover is a deep, rich gold. \"One preschool teacher said that the colors are especially comforting to children,\" said Morales. \"Another young child said that her favorite part of the book is the color of the cover.\" The Crow Who Was Not Asked to Stay was published in 2013 and is now available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, Nicola's Books, and at on-line retailers. In addition, copies are available at Elmo's Main Street T-Shirts in Ann Arbor, a family business run by Morales and her husband, Elmo. Morales, who also leads spinning classes, said that after a recent class, an adult student told her that the book had made him feel sad. \"He said that he thought for a very long time about why he felt so sad after reading it. He said that he learned a lot about himself through that process. It's really been fun for me to hear how the book has had an impact on people. That is very gratifying.\" Prior to becoming a published author, Morales worked as a psychotherapist and social worker. Now retired from those vocations, Morales continues to teach meditation workshops and retreats. Her published writings include a novel, A Barroom View of Love (Burns Park Publishers, 2010), articles on mental health for Huffington Post Healthy Living and Annarbor.com, and poetry in many literary journals, including Bridges, The Third Wednesday, and The Huron River Review.

However, many children and adults are not as clear on what happens to all these materials once they are trucked away. A main goal of Ann Arbor's Ecology Center and the educational programs they coordinate is to educate Ann Arborites about what happens to our waste and how to be more informed consumers and recyclers, according to Laura Holladay, Education Director. The Ecology Center currently coordinates two complementary programs for children and families: field trips and open houses at the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) and outreach programs through area schools. Both of these programs are free of charge. Holladay said that, until last year, the City of Ann Arbor ran the programs at the MRF, located at 4150 Platt Road. After their education director retired, the city invited other organizations to apply to coordinate them. \"The Ecology Center was very excited to be selected to run these highly successful programs,\" said Holladay. Located at 339 East Liberty in Ann Arbor, the Ecology Center is a nonprofit organization founded in 1970 in response to the nation's first Earth Day celebrations. It currently serves more than 10,000 students in kindergarten through high school in southeastern Michigan. \"Running the programs at the MRF seems a natural fit for us, since we've been involved with environmental education for children for so many years,\" said Holladay. Programs at the MRF include scheduled field trips and tours for classroom groups, Scout troops, and other organizations, as well as monthly open houses for families. Organized tours and field trips can be scheduled Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. for preschool through college students. Holladay said that she and colleague MacKenzie Maxwell tailor field trips to the ages and interests of the classes. For example, since preschool and kindergarten children are not allowed on the recycling plant floor, they may get a guided tour looking through windows at recyclable materials being sorted and can play games related to recycling, sorting materials, and so on. They can also enjoy a bus ride out to the areas where compost is being prepared. Older students will be allowed onto the plant floor to get a close-up view of the machines that sort and process recyclables. Holladay said that these field trips are free of charge to groups of all kinds and that there is still availability this school year. \"Fortunately, we are not completely overwhelmed with scheduled field trips this year \u2014 yet!\" she said. Teachers or group leaders interested in scheduling a field trip should call the Ecology Center at (734) 369-9272 or email them at education@ecocenter.org. For individuals and families interested in visiting the MRF, the Ecology Center offers monthly Saturday open house tours and workshops from September through June. Held between 10 a.m. and noon, each open house offers an optional activity around a theme and a tour of the MRF recycling plant. Upcoming themes include a recycled paper Valentine card (February 8), musical instruments created from discarded items (March 8), and reusable bags from old T-shirts (April 19). Holladay said that these events are all free, although some may require participants to bring simple supplies, such as an old T-shirt for the reusable bag project. In the future, some programs may require a small fee. Holladay said that she has heard many requests for a vermicompost (worm composting) workshop; the Ecology Center is exploring that possibility, which would allow participants to take home a complete worm-composting box. A complete schedule of upcoming open houses is available at www.ecocenter.org/education/mrf. Holladay said that often, but not always, the recycling plant lines are shut down by 11 a.m. on Saturdays, allowing even younger children to venture onto the plant floors. \"We can't guarantee that, since sometimes they are still busy, but it's usually a time we can invite everyone onto the floor to get a close-up view of the lines.\" Long pants and closed-toed shoes are required for anyone wishing to tour the plant floor. In order to insure there are enough materials and staff for all, Scout troops and other groups larger than five are asked to pre-register. A main goal of Ann Arbor's Ecology Center and the educational programs they coordinate is to educate Ann Arborites about what happens to our waste and how to be more informed consumers and recyclers. Visitors to the MRF can also enjoy viewing a large mural created by local artist David Zinn that illustrates the life of garbage in a landfill. \"Coming to the MRF provides a really good snapshot of what happens to all that 'stuff' we put out on our curbs. \" \u2014 Laur a Holladay, Ecology Center Education DirectorIn addition to the fun, recycled craft projects, visiting the MRF for an open house is a great way for kids and families to really understand recycling and what happens to our discarded materials. \"Coming to the MRF provides a really good snapshot of what happens to all that 'stuff' we put out on our curbs,\" said Holladay. \"For example, kids can start to understand recycling rules, like 'Why can't we put the yogurt lids in the recycling bins if they are made from a recyclable plastic?'\" Holladay said that once kids see the machinery close-up, they learn that the first part of the sorting process is an automated system that sorts flat materials from cans, bottles, and so on. \"Lids will sort with flat pieces like cardboard and paper and will contaminate things. They will see the benefits and the drawbacks of the single-stream recycling system and how it's not perfect,\" explained Holladay. Children can also see first-hand why Ann Arborites cannot currently recycle plastic bags and Styrofoam. \"Those materials are so light-weight they tend to fly around and get stuck in the gears and machinery,\" she said. \"That is dangerous for the machines and for the workers managing the lines. When kids see this and the hazards these things create, it helps them become more informed consumers and recyclers.\" Both plastic bags and Styrofoam can be dropped off for a fee at the Drop-Off Station at 2950 East Ellsworth, and many area grocers have receptacles for free plastic bag recycling. Holladay said that a lesson to learn from a MRF tour is that the inorganic materials we put into our trash and recycling bins are never truly gone. \"When people of any age come to tour our facilities, the most important idea we want them to leave with is that there simply is no such thing as 'away' for things we want to get rid of,\" said Holladay. \"When you are done with something, it's up to you to figure out what needs to happen to it. That can mean recycling, composting, reusing, repurposing, or sometimes, it just has to end up in the landfill. But there is no 'away' for anything. That's the essential take-away message.\" Visitors to the MRF can also enjoy viewing a large mural created by local artist David Zinn that illustrates the life of garbage in a landfill. \"This mural really helps The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 74 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 73 get complicated concepts across,\" said Holladay. \"David uses his cartoon style to illustrate something complex, like how trash can create methane that can power a generator. We do sell methane power to the city of Ann Arbor, but it's hard to talk to kids about how that happens. The mural does a great job of illustrating that.\" In addition, Zinn has created the \"Adventures of Waste Watchers,\" a series of kid-friendly cartoons on topics like single-stream recycling, zero waste, global warming, and alternative fuels. Printable editions are available from the MRF website. \"These are great resources for parents and teachers,\" said Holladay. In addition to the programs offered at the MRF, the Ecology Center coordinates an extensive school outreach program for children in preschool through high school. \"We have done these programs for years, but now they've become so popular we have to run a lottery system for educators interested in them,\" said Holladay. Currently there are 2.5 times the number of applicants that can be accepted each year. \"That's why we are especially excited to be able to offer the free programs and field trips at the MRF \u2014 because we are currently unable to accommodate all of the requests for in-school outreach workshops, but we can invite everyone to come to the MRF,\" she said. Teachers interested in entering next year's lottery can do so beginning in early September. Classrooms currently enrolled in the outreach program benefit from activities specifically designed to match the schools' curriculum. \"Teachers give us input on what they need,\" said Holladay. \"For example, the fourth grade curriculum in Ann Arbor covers 'Nature's Recyclers,' and we can help teachers set up habitat boxes for their classrooms with soil, decomposing wood, worms, slugs. Kids can watch the process right in their classrooms. The goal of the outreach program is to complement and support the curriculum and to help classroom teachers as much as we can.\" Outreach activities for a preschool classroom might include shaping play dough into different forms to explore the idea of recycling, making crafts from discarded materials, and reading stories about recycling, decomposers, and so on. Holladay said that one of her favorite outreach workshops to teach is the high school \"Living Lightly on the Earth\" session, which focuses on consumer choices and how they affect our environment. \"When people are given the choice of a paper or plastic bag at the grocery store, many of them think they should always choose paper because it's something they can recycle. They think that because plastic bags are made from a non-renewable resource that they are always the wrong choice. But there are other things to consider, like the weight of the paper bags and the resources to ship them. There's no right or wrong answer. Many of the high school students keep pressing me, asking 'But which choice is right?' We encourage the students to figure out what they think, weigh the options, and to make their own informed choices.\" Holladay said that her personal interest in ecology and the environment was spurred by a geology field school course in Wyoming that she took as part of her undergraduate geology major at the University of Michigan. She later earned her master's degree in ecology and environmental biology. \"I come from a family of educators,\" she said. \"I've always enjoyed working with children.\" A volunteer role at Ann Arbor's Hands-On Museum turned into paid employment as their outreach specialist. When the environmental educator job opened at the Ecology Center, Holladay said she jumped at the chance to continue working with young people and to focus on teaching them about environmental issues. She has been with the Ecology Center since 2006. The Ecology Center coordinates other programs of interest to parents. These including Home Safe Parties to help families test the safety of everyday objects in their homes and \"Healthy Stuff\" in-house toxins testing at the Ecology Center. The in-house toxins testing workshops focus on a particular product category such as car seats, auto interiors, Halloween face paints, toys, pet toys, and so on. The Ecology Center maintains a database of findings at www.healthystuff.org. \"We love that we can help have an impact on commercial businesses, especially those that affect children. Anyone who scores poorly initially gets angry, but some companies come to us and want to know how to improve their scores. We can help them to create better, safer products,\" Holladay explained.

That one hour of undivided attention tells them, 'This person cares about me.'\" According to Rolfes, that attention results in significant academic progress for the vast majority of students who attend the free reading, writing, and math programs at FLI. Ann Arbor's FLI, located at 1954 South Industrial, was created in response to Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) test results that showed a widening achievement gap in Washtenaw County. In other words, educators noticed that children from low-income families performed poorly on the test when compared with students from high-income families. Community organizer Lafiest Galimore and retired teacher and evaluation expert Doris Sperling developed the concept for FLI and established it in 1999 to improve achievement for lower-income students. \"We absolutely are not saying that the Ann Arbor district is doing anything wrong,\" said Rolfes. \"We know it's a strong district and it's doing so many things really well. What we also know is that there are kids who need more and kids who need something different.\" Rolfes was a classroom teacher herself when she became a FLI volunteer in 2006. \"I felt that I wasn't always reaching the kids I wanted to reach in the classroom,\" she said. She became executive director of FLI in 2008. The structure and content of the programs offered at FLI are significantly different from what a child might experience in a typical classroom setting. The Reading Program, which began in 1999 and currently serves about 72 children in second through fifth grades, is the largest program at FLI. After being referred to the program, typically by a classroom teacher, although some parents do contact FLI directly, each student is given a Qualitative Reading Inventory (QRI) test that provides specific data about the skills that child needs to work on. \"The QRI can show, for example, that a child is struggling with certain aspects of phonics such as beginning sounds, middle vowels, or ending sounds, or with comprehension,\" explained Rolfes. A certified reading specialist, JoEllen Mogelgaard, administers the test. Once a child's needs are identified, he or she is matched with a volunteer coach who meets with the child weekly. \"Many of our volunteers are retired community members,\" said Rolfes. \"However, we're also seeing an increasing number of young professionals who recognize the needs of these kids and who feel a responsibility to help.\" Each week, that coach meets one-on-one with the child for one hour. \"They meet with the same child each week and that student trusts that their coach cares about them,\" said Rolfes. \"Once that trust is established, the student will try to please the coach. We set them up in their own reading room, with their own coach, and with materials that are appropriate for their level. It leads to great success.\" The privacy aspect of the coaching is also very important, Rolfes explained. \"All of our tutoring happens in private rooms. No one wants to be known as the stupid kid. No one wants to be that kid pulled out of the classroom. We have the ability to keep our tutoring private in a way that a regular classroom setting just cannot.\" The targeted nature of the material studied by each student also fosters progress. \"It's really important to emphasize that what we do here is not homework help,\" said Rolfes. \"Much of the homework that these children get in their classroom setting is beyond their level at this time. Instead, what we are doing is very specific, very intense academic intervention. We meet each child where he or she is at Once a child's needs are identified, he or she is matched with a volunteer coach who meets with the child weekly. Continued on page 76 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 76 Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Continued from page 75 this time, based on the data we get from the QRI. If we are working with a fourth grader at a first grade reading level, then we make sure to give them work that they can do.\" Rolfes said that this method both creates success and makes the kids feel accomplished. \"Many of these kids can rarely complete their classroom work successfully. They do not feel good about themselves as students. When they can complete the activities here, we can show them that they can do it. Our coaches constantly tell them, 'You are doing awesome! See, you did that! You are successful. You can do this.'\" If a coach has questions or needs additional support during a reading session, a reading specialist is always on hand to answer questions or to provide additional support. The individualized nature of the program also gives the students some control over their learning process. \"Kids can be distractible, and some may not want to do a particular activity,\" explained Rolfes. In a regular classroom setting the student may be required to work alongside the rest of the class, but in a private setting like FLI the student can be given some choice in his or her activities. \"Each child has a binder with her activities listed, and the coach can allow the child to choose the order in which those activities can be completed,\" said Rolfes. \"Just that amount of control can be huge. In the classroom, these kids have little control over anything. Here, they can feel like they are at least a little bit in charge of their own learning, and that can be a powerful motivator.\" Following each one-hour session of individual coaching time, students come together in a group of six for one hour of Writing Table. The Writing Table activities follow the Ann Arbor Public Schools' core curriculum. While enjoying snacks generously provided by Food Gatherers, students are presented with a writing mini-lesson and journal in response to a prompt. Students then read their writing out loud to gain public speaking practice. \"Reading their own writing out loud in front of their peers makes them more conscious of what they are writing,\" explained Rolfes. \"It also encourages them to complete their writing. They often complete one or two entire paragraphs of writing here. This is a great accomplishment. In school, they may rarely finish a task they are assigned. Here, they feel a sense of accomplishment every single week.\" Students are sometimes given the opportunity to type their writing on FLI's laptop computers. Rolfes said that giving students access to technology is beneficial in a number of ways. \"It's nice for students to be able to print and type their work so that they can take home something that looks polished,\" she said. Even more important is giving lower-income students every opportunity to engage with computers. \"The increased use of technologies in our schools is both beneficial and detrimental to lower-income students,\" she explained. \"For the kids who are given their own iPad or tablet at age two, using the technologies in school is natural. For kids who might have never touched a computer until they get into school, being expected to know what to do with one just makes the divide that much greater.\" Rolfes said that FLI is extremely grateful to Kiwanis for a grant that recently allowed them to purchase seven new laptop computers. Rolfes said that they also make sure to infuse academics with fun activities. Near Halloween, for example, students wrote and typed pieces either about Halloween or about fall. The volunteer coaches each waited in a private reading room with treats. Rather than saying \"trick or treat,\" students read their writing to the coaches to receive candy. \"The kids were thrilled,\" said Rolfes. \"Not only did they feel proud of their writing, the coaches reinforced their success and they all got candy to take home!\" After four weeks in the program, parents and family members are invited to see what Rolfes calls a \"Snapshot Session\" of the process. Guests spend fifteen minutes with their student and the student's coach, getting to know the coach and the process and learning how they can continue working at home. Two times each year, FLI presents a Writers' Spotlight event to showcase student writing. Family members, coaches, and classroom teachers gather to listen to the children read pieces of writing they chose. \"Last year we had more than seventy guests,\" said Rolfes. \"It was a great opportunity for the students to practice their public speaking with a microphone and to present the writing they are most proud of.\" Once a student has completed six months in the Reading Program, he or she takes the QRI again to assess their progress. Most students demonstrate significant improvement. By the time students have completed 12 months in the program, about 85 percent have advanced two grade levels in reading. \"The interventions we give are so specific to each child's needs. This allows most children to advance very quickly,\" said Rolfes. Once a child has advanced to grade level, FLI lets the family know that their child can \"graduate\" from the program; however, no child is ever forced to leave. \"Some kids get the support they need, get the confidence, learn the skills, and feel good to go,\" said Rolfes. \"However, we know that, for some kids, the reason they are successful is because of the emotional support and individual attention the coaches give them.\" Rolfes shared the story of Nevaeh, a student who started in the Reading Program two years ago as a second grader. When Nevaeh started at FLI, she tested at three to four grade levels behind in reading. Currently, Nevaeh is a fourth grader who tests a bit ahead of her grade level. When Nevaeh learned that she no longer needed FLI's tutoring, she was upset and wanted to continue. Rolfes said that successful learners are welcome to continue so long as their attendance and participation remain good.\"All of our tutoring happens in private rooms. No one wants to be known as the stupid kid. No one wants to be that kid pulled out of the classroom. We have the ability to keep our tutoring private in a way that a regular classroom setting just cannot. \" \u2014 A my Rolfes \"It's really important to emphasize that what we do here is not homework help. Much of the homework that these children get in their classroom setting is beyond their level at this time. Instead, what we are doing is very specific, very intense academic intervention. \" \u2014 Amy Rolfes The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 77 In addition to the highly successful Reading Program, FLI runs a Monday Math program. Last year, 21 students in second through fifth grades gathered on Monday evenings to spend one hour doing individualized, one-on-one math tutoring, followed by one hour of group math games. Rolfes said that 95 percent of students in Monday Math advance by two grade levels after one year in the program. She believes that the FLI program is the only free math tutoring program of its kind in Ann Arbor. Children who complete the Core Reading and Monday Math programs at FLI experience long-term success as well. Rolfes said that two of FLI's \"graduates\" are currently in college on academic scholarships, one at Wayne State and another at Grand Valley State. \"We are proud of these students and all our kids. Most of the children who come to us do not have any learning disabilities. They are the kids who might be frequently absent, distracted by all the things going on in their families' lives, just not able to pay attention in school. Once they have missed out on things, when they are learning critical skills like early reading and math, it can be very hard for them to ever catch up,\" said Rolfes. \"We are committed to helping them catch up before it is too late for them to be successful.\" The Family Learning Institute offers additional programs to support students and their families, including a summer Brain Boot Camp aimed at preventing summer learning loss in lower-income children. Rolfes said that kids from lower-income families often do not get to experience summer camps and programs, which makes them even more susceptible to losing skills. During the summer of 2012, volunteers guided 30 second through fifth graders in small groups as they practiced reading, writing, math, and computer skills. Testing showed that 100 percent of the students involved maintained their reading levels over the summer. Rolfes thanked the Speckhard-Knight Charitable Foundation and the Herbert and Elsa Ponting Foundation for their support of Brain Boot Camp. Fifth graders who are \"graduating\" from FLI are offered the opportunity to participate in Super U, a program that Rolfes said helps teach the \"soft skills\" necessary to succeed in middle school. Students learn how to operate a locker, pack and organize a backpack, handle schedules from multiple teachers, make new friends, and so on. In addition, students enjoy fun and educational outings to local museums and labs and eat meals at favorite local restaurants. \"Some of these students may not have had the opportunity to order a meal in a restaurant,\" Rolfes explained. \"We help them read the menu, talk about social skills \u2014 all those things that help them feel confident as they go on to middle school.\" In response to parent concerns about middle school achievement, FLI recently established an Algebra Academy for sixth grade students. \"We heard from so many parents that their children were flunking algebra. It's a whole new skill set that can be really challenging. We try to respond to what the community needs. Now we are working to help kids with the thinking skills needed for algebra.\" To further support middle school students, another new initiative is the Young People's Project, in which high school students mentor middle school students. Rolfes said that there is currently a short waiting list for the Reading Program. Teachers or parents interested in placing a student in next fall's program should enroll him or her in this summer's Brain Boot Camp, which would secure a spot for that child for fall. The Monday Math program currently has a waiting list of approximately one year. \"Our expansion is really confined by our physical space right now,\" she said. \"We value the privacy for each child, and we currently only have six private rooms.\" She said that while they are often asked to do outreach activities in area schools, the success of the FLI programs depends partly on bringing the students away from school. \"We have done some outreach and continue to explore ways to do even more, but, at the same time, an essential part of our success with these kids is the fact that they are coming away from school. They have their own room, their own coach, their own time. This is so helpful for the social and emotional needs of our students and that creates academic success.\" Rolfes said that her dream would be to have a larger facility that could serve even more students. She expressed gratitude for all the generous donors to FLI, noting that they are especially grateful to the Towsley Foundation for their generous matching grant of $150,000, which they will begin receiving in 2014. \"Our hope is to change the life of every child who comes through our door,\" said Rolfes. \"Our donors and our volunteers allow us to do that.\" Teachers or parents interested in learning about enrolling a child in a FLI program should call (734) 995-6816 or email info@familylearninginstitute.org. One may also download enrollment applications at www.familylearninginstitute.org/enroll.html.

Ann Arbor' s Therapeutic Riding, Inc. is a non- profit organization that allows children and adults with disabilities the chance to experience the joy of horseback riding and other equine assisted activities. herapeutic riding instructor Jan Vescelius said that she feels fortunate to have a job that consistently \"brings joy into so many lives.\" A professional horseman since the 1970s, Vescelius is the executive director, program director, and head instructor for Ann Arbor's Therapeutic Riding, Inc. (TRI), a non-profit organization that allows children and adults with disabilities the chance to experience the joy of horseback riding and other equine assisted activities. Vescelius already had a great deal of horse experience, including owning her own boarding and training facility and teaching horsemanship to beginning through advanced riders, when she read a magazine article about therapeutic riding. She was intrigued by the physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits associated with therapeutic riding. Vescelius helped start the therapeutic riding program in Lenawee County as a volunteer, and became certified as a therapeutic riding instructor in 1991 after completing extensive training at the Cheff Therapeutic Riding Center in Augusta, Michigan. She is a Professional Association of Therapeutic Riding (PATH) International, Advanced Level Certified Instructor, and a Michigan State University Proud Equestrians Program Instructor. When Ann Arbor's TRI needed a backup instructor Vescelius stepped in. \"It just snowballed after that!\" she said. Founded in 1984, TRI recently underwent a major expansion of their facilities; Vescelius was part of the team that was able to create this modern riding facility from the ground up. She said that in the previous location on Joy Road the program was able to accommodate approximately 60-70 riders. \"We were and are still so grateful to the Domino's Farms Land Development and Tom Monaghan. He let us use his facility free of charge. We tripled our rider base there and built a firm foundation for growth, but we were at capacity and couldn't expand any more,\" she explained. Vescelius said that, for several years, potential riders had to wait two or more years in order to secure a lesson spot. \"As we grew, we knew we needed either a long-term lease or our own property,\" she said. An answer came in the form of extraordinary donations from Harold and Kay Peplau, the Lloyd and Mabel Johnson Foundation, and The Legacy Land Conservancy. \"Although we had these incredible donors, part of the agreement was still that we had to raise matching funds, and even in the tough economic times of the last several years, we were able to do that,\" said Vescelius. With funding secured and a conservation easement to protect the land in perpetuity, TRI was able to purchase 46 acres of land in Pittsfield Township at a fraction of market value. In December of 2010, the new facility, located at 3425 East Morgan Road, opened. It features amenities including a 20 stall barn, a heated, indoor arena, climate-controlled observation rooms and offices, an outdoor arena, automatic waterers for the horses, and acres of fenced pasture land. \"This facility has allowed us to expand our programs and to offer this experience to even more riders. We still have a waiting list, but it is more of a rolling list now,\" said Vescelius.Therapeutic Riding, Inc., draws children and adults with disabilities from Washtenaw and surrounding counties. They offer private, semi-private, and group therapeutic riding lessons, as well as lessons in grooming and tacking horses and ground lessons focused on safety, showmanship, horse leading, and handling. Riders range from children as young as four to senior citizens with a range of diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, Down Syndrome, multiple sclerosis, A.D.D./A.D.H.D., sensory integration disorders, vision and hearing impairments, traumatic brain injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Parkinson's disease. \"We will work with anyone with any disability as long as it is medically safe for the person to ride,\" explained Vescelius. \"We do evaluations on all prospective riders. We talk to the participants and families to find out what their goals are. Of course, there is the dreaded paperwork that includes a physician's referral and a therapist's referral when that's appropriate. We work with our riders' medical professionals to make sure that everything is done safely and to help them achieve their goals.\" Vescelius said that other than medical safety for riders, the only other limiting factor is a weight limit. \"This can sometimes be an incentive for our riders, too,\" explained Vescelius. \"For some people with certain physical disabilities who cannot move about easily, it is hard to keep weight down. If they love riding, it may help motivate them.\" One of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of Vescelius' job is to create the best possible match between one of TRI's 14 horses and the 80-100 regularly scheduled riders. \"It's really important to have that perfect fit between horse and rider,\" explained Vescelius. \"If we put you on the wrong horse, it just won't work. We have all sizes of horses with different types of movement, and it is important to In December of 2010, the new facility, located at 3425 East Morgan Road, opened.

The equipment is all designed to enhance each rider's safety and abilities. During a recent lesson, one student who has no feeling in her legs rode with stirrups that completely enclosed and supported her feet (Devonshire boots); another rode with a natural ride saddle that allowed her to grip the top portion of the saddle while using the reins. Riders also rely upon TRI's team of more than 150 volunteers. Vescelius said that some ride independently while others require as many as three volunteers specifically trained to help them mount and ride. When a rider and horse are well-matched, Vescelius said that children and adults with disabilities can experience significant physical, cognitive, emotional, and social benefits. \"We teach therapeutic riding,\" emphasized Vescelius. \"My job is to teach our riders how to approach, interact, and ride our horses safely while learning riding skills.\" When that happens, other benefits often come with it. Vescelius said that riding horses can improve muscle strength and balance. \"The horse provides vestibular movement, sometimes explained as 3-D movement, and this movement provides the therapeutic benefits,\" explained Vescelius. \"It stimulates different parts of the brain and may help with balance, communication, cognitive skills, and more. Riding can increase muscle tone in one rider while reducing spasticity \u2014 muscle tightness \u2014 in another.\" Vescelius' own grandson was born with Angelman Syndrome, a genetic disorder that may include developmental delay, lack of speech, walking, seizures, and balance disorders. \"I feel as if riding a horse helped him to strengthen his trunk so that he was eventually able to sit up on his own,\" she said. \"Therapeutic horseback riding can enhance lives in other ways as well,\" she said. \"We used to say it was the 'magic' of therapeutic riding that was so beneficial to our riders, but now there is scientific evidence to back it up. For people on the autism spectrum, the movement of the horse may be calming,\" said Vescelius, adding that some of TRI's riders become much more verbal during their lessons. Instructors and volunteers often play spelling and alphabet games with riders, helping them to identify and put letters in order around the arena, a game that helps riders' cognitive and motor skills. For more independent riders, TRI has a dry erase board for each lesson, showing the rider the pattern they should follow for that lesson. They also use dressage, jump poles, and western games to have fun while learning. Vescelius said that for many riders and their families the emotional and social benefits of riding are significant. \"If we do nothing but bring joy into someone's life, then it's absolutely worth it. Horses might not initially seem like your niche in life, but if this gets you out of your home, interacting with your volunteers, and for one hour you have control over your life while in partnership with your horse, it can be very powerful.\" Forming relationships with the horses is also rewarding. \"It's also important to think about people bonding with their animals,\" said Vescelius. \"A horse has no preconceived idea of who we are. All they know is that if we are kind, they will be kind in return. They are masters of watching over our body language. If you come up quietly and approach calmly, they will respond to you. We can use this in working with children, especially people on the autism spectrum or those who have been abused who may struggle with social skills,\" she explained. \"We explain, 'If I walk up and get up close to your face or tap you or get loud, would you like that? Or would you prefer a quiet approach, a gentle touch on your shoulder to say hello?' We can use our horses to teach those life skills.\" The staff also teaches riders about the horses' different personalities, showing that just like people, different horses respond better to different approaches. \"If a child comes in too aggressively, a horse may back off. People are like that, too, and might not want to interact with you. It is a life lesson using our horses!\" In addition to the direct benefits to the riders, parents also enjoy the experience of connecting with other families at TRI. \"For some families, we hope they feel that it is a second home,\" said Vescelius. \"Riders may come in having a meltdown, having a really bad day, and no one judges their behavior. It's a really supportive atmosphere for our families.\" Vescelius said that she and her staff encourage parents to stay in the observation area during lessons rather than coming out into the arena. \"We encourage parents to take that lesson time and to read a book or network with the other families. We have their kids for lesson time once a week and it's a time when mom and dad aren't there telling them what to do. It's a different voice and we can sometimes use the lesson to help motivate them in a new way.\" When a rider and horse are well-matched, Vescelius said that children and adults with disabilities can experience significant physical, cognitive, emotional, and social benefits.\"The horse provides vestibular movement, sometimes explained as 3-D movement, and this movement provides the therapeutic benefits. \" Continued on page 80The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 80 \"We hope to give them skills they can use for a lifetime and be there for them to ride as long as they desire, so long as it's medically safe, but we expect our riders to put something into it themselves,\" Vescelius said. For example, she explained that while the staff and volunteers will always help a rider mount their horse, they encourage conversation about transfers and self-help. \"We expect them to try and we will support their abilities. This builds both strength and self-confidence. It's very different when we challenge them versus when mom or dad tells them to do something at home. We always work with parents to reinforce what they are working on as well.\" Vescelius said she is grateful for the support from generous donors. Fees account for less than 19 percent of the actual cost of lessons. In addition, no rider is ever turned away due to an inability to pay. Families in need of financial assistance can request support from TRI's Sam and Juliana Zirinsky Memorial Scholarship Fund, established by their parents Ruth Schekter and Bill Zirinsky (the owners of Crazy Wisdom). Both children suffered from a degenerative neuro-metabolic disorder. Vescelius fondly remembers her time working with Juliana during her riding lessons and is grateful for the generous support provided by the scholarship fund. \"It makes it possible to offer this experience to children and adults who could not have it otherwise,\" she said. In addition to the year-round lessons, TRI began a summer camp program in 2013 and offers a \"Day at the Farm\" field trip program for other non-profit organizations. They also offer group tours. Recent participating organizations included The Greater Detroit Agency for the Blind and Visually Impaired, SOS Community, Canton Leisure Club, and other agencies that work with homeless children and children in foster care programs. Vescelius said that hosting groups like these always helps her experience the farm and the horses from new perspectives. \"The children who cannot see open the eyes of those who can. I am just so blessed to be able to do this.\" \"If we do nothing but bring joy into someone' s life, then it' s absolutely worth it. Horses might not initially seem like your niche in life, but if this gets you out of your home, interacting with your volunteers, and for one hour you have control over your life while in partnership with your horse, it can be very powerful. \" - Jan Vescelius Volunteers are always needed. Vescelius said that individuals with and without horse experience are welcome. \"We can teach you to lead a horse, to groom and tack, to help riders with mounting. If you want to learn more, we can teach you more. It's a great opportunity to learn!\" To volunteer or to learn more about enrolling in the riding programs, visit TRI's website at www.therapeuticridinginc.org, call them at (734) 677-0303, or email info@therapeuticridinginc.org .

Continued from page 79The Contagious Joy at Therapeutic Riding, Inc.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 81 As an early childhood educator and parent, I am daily challenged to keep my cool and composure and to consciously choose how I want to be before I interact with children. Children need guidance, boundaries, and structure in their lives. They also need parents who can skillfully navigate through the daily situations that often become points of conflict. Leaving the house in the morning for school, getting ready for dinner, and putting away toys in the living room \u2014 these situations can leave a frustrated parent wondering, Where is the patience I used to have with children? How can I keep my emotions in check? They also present an opportunity for parents who tend to fall back on old habits to question if they habitually react, perhaps channeling their own parents or relatives when they yell or scream, resent a child, or anger too quickly. Knee-jerk reactions like these reflect the long dominant parenting paradigm of compliance, domination, control, and manipulation of children. It's a paradigm that is perhaps ingrained in our collective histories but is dying out as a new parenting paradigm emerges that calls on parents to ask how conscious and how mindful their reactions are to their children. Over the past ten years, scientific research on this topic has been documented and explored, resulting in a revolutionary parenting approach in which parents work with children based on mutual respect, understanding needs, and unconditional parenting. I invite parents to take a look at this more conscious, less stressful approach to parenting. In the new paradigm, the focus changes from child to parent and seeks to explore what the parent brings into the relationship with the child. It asks you to create the time and space to be truly conscious and mindful in the present moment as you are in relationship with your child. It also involves developing the ability to truly see the needs of your child that are not tarnished or stained by your unconscious habits, unexamined values, and beliefs. This is more easily said than done! The new paradigm acknowledges that how you unconsciously react to the wants of children misses a conscious response to their genuine needs. Educator and author Joseph Chilton Pearce raises a profound question to all parents \u2014 a question that as a Waldorf School teacher and now parent I ask myself every day \u2014 which is, Am I worthy of imitation? Young children pick up and absorb every aspect of our being. They lack the censorship or filtering out that is common to adults. Why then, as parents, do we act surprised when they give it right back to us? What follows briefly outlines some key starting points for parents interested in applying the concepts of the new paradigm. I encourage parents to explore these ideas as they reconsider their parenting practices and consider achieving greater self discipline. To begin, you need be in unconditional presence with your child. Specifically, focus and observe your child without judgment or with suspended judgment. It's a way of filtering out your own \"unfinished\" issues of power, control, and parenting histories in order to truly observe the child \"as is.\" Next, you need to carefully observe the child with a term that educator Kim John Payne calls \"soft eyes\" in order to truly understand the needs of the child beneath his or her external behavior. Whisper to yourself the words that you may say to your child, especially during stressful times when your child triggers you. Stop, focus on your breathing, and reflect on where your perceptions and judgments come from. You can examine your unconscious reactions to children by silently acknowledging these reactions and simply not speaking them out loud. It is indeed very rare that you must yell or scream at a child in direct danger, so just live with your own reactions. This is the first step in attempting to change your unconscious reactions: make them conscious and just live with them. Dr. Shefali Tsabary writes in The Conscious Parent (Namaste Publishing, 2010) that \"Until we understand exactly how we have been operating in an unconscious mode, we tend to resist opening ourselves to an approach to parenting that rests on entirely different ideals from those we may have relied on until now.\" At this point, it is vital not to fall into the \"blame or shame\" game that deflates your self-esteem. Rather, you need to move into self-empathy and reflect on how your unconscious reactions may not line up with your authentic goals of raising children that become happy, emotionally healthy, responsible, ethical, caring, critically thinking, and \"decision ally\" literate as they mature in life. Therapist and family relationship theorist Hal Edward Runkel starts his book Screamfree Parenting (Harmony, 2008) with the basic premise that children cannot become responsible for themselves as long as we consider ourselves responsible for their lives and their choices. We are only responsible for our own lives and our own choices. He writes that the only way to retain a position of influence with our children is to regain a position of control over ourselves. The greatest gift we can give our children is to focus on our own mind stream. This sounds so narcissistic, yet it functions as a way to carefully examine if our intentions, motivations, and actions actually align with the parent we truly want to be. Children do frustrating, annoying, and sometimes unkind behaviors! The times when they need your unconditional love and presence are the same times that you are responsible to them for your behavior, feelings, and choices. Alfie Kohn, author of Unconditional Parenting (Atria, 2006) and Punished by Rewards (Mariner, 1999), argues that to be a better parent, just practice these four words: Talk less, ask more. How much can we truly understand what is going on inside a child if we do most of the talking? By asking questions you are opening up the relationship to a \"working with\" rather than \"a doing to\" approach. This is a basic form of respect that you need to share with children. Even though children learn through imitation, Kohn argues that they need to practice this learning by having the opportunity to make decisions. In the new mindful parenting paradigm, children do not need to be disciplined with rewards and punishment. Children do not need so called \"healthy shame\" or any other doggie biscuit approach to discipline, yet most parenting books and articles are still fixated on how to get kids to jump through our hoops of demands and expectations. It's time to change the focus from child to parent, from enforcing a child's discipline to evaluating our inner discipline as parents.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 82 Yoga for Mamas: Celebrating the Journey of Motherhood Each Monday morning for an hour and a half, I am surrounded by the blissful energy of mothers, babies, and moms-to-be as we practice yoga together at Hygeia Center for Healing Arts in downtown Ann Arbor. My children have grown up with me rolling out my mat on the living room floor. When they were toddlers they would join me, climbing in and around all my poses, creating a joyful tangle of arms, legs, and laughter.

For me, Monday morning dawns with anticipation of the celebration to come. Each Monday morning for an hour and a half, I am surrounded by the blissful energy of mothers, babies, and moms-to-be as we practice yoga together at Hygeia Center for Healing Arts in downtown Ann Arbor. \"Yoga for Mamas\" is a class offered to pregnant women as well as postpartum mothers and their babies, 12 months and younger. A great sense of community is built with having both pre and postnatal moms present. Pregnant mamas are reminded by the presence of infants that their pregnancy will progress toward the birth of their own child, postnatal moms are happy to have found a class where their babies are welcome, and both groups appreciate having discovered a class that focuses on their adjustment to pregnancy, parenting, and motherhood. The collaborative class allows pre and postnatal mamas to share a wealth of knowledge, resources, and empathy and to build a supportive network during the childbearing year. As a yoga teacher and a clinical social worker specializing in infant mental health, I am grateful to offer a class that focuses on celebrating women and children and the bond between them. The benefits of yoga for women, particularly for mothers, is well documented. Over the past year, I have had the pleasure of working with Dr. Maria Muzic, M.D., of U-M Health Services Perinatal Depression Clinic on the Mindfulness Yoga Pregnancy Study examining prenatal yoga as a tool to decrease depression and anxiety in expectant mothers. This study \u2014 along with a plethora of books, magazine articles, and videos \u2014 cite the benefits of yoga for mothers to be abundant. Yoga during the prenatal period builds strength and stamina in the body while increasing a mother's mindfulness of her baby in utero and enhancing the bonding process. It helps women prepare for birth by teaching them to breathe, relax, and surrender to the process of their changing bodies as their babies grow. Yoga also empowers women to take an active stance in mitigating the uncomfortable symptoms of pregnancy, such as back pain, swelling, and a constantly changing center of balance. Postnatal mothers are also well supported by yoga practice as it allows them to regain their pre-baby body through strength, balance, and flexibility work. Attention to the breath alleviates worry about the transition to motherhood and can help calm a new mom as she learns how to care for her little one. Practicing restorative poses gives a new mom a chance to rest, allowing her to cope with the inevitable lack of sleep experienced while caring for a newborn. Most important, by coming to a weekly yoga class, pre and postnatal mothers are less likely to experience isolation as they are able to build a supportive community. Perhaps the greatest benefit of the Yoga for Mamas class is the joy brought to the faces of the infants as they delight in their mother's graceful movement, the calm, safe atmosphere in the room, and the discovery that other little people like them exist in the world. As a mom of two teenagers, I still turn to my yoga practice as a means to support my mothering. Yoga helps me to slow down, to stay present in each and every moment of my shared experiences with my children, and to stay emotionally regulated when anxious, tired, or irritable. My children have grown up with me rolling out my mat on the living room floor. When they were toddlers they would join me, climbing in and around all my poses, creating a joyful tangle of arms, legs, and laughter. My first teacher, Barbara Linderman of Inward Bound Yoga, talked me into becoming a yoga teacher after I had been her student for several years. Every day for six weeks, she asked me to teach a Yoga for Kids class until I finally agreed. As I grew from yoga student to teacher, I was joined by my own children in the classroom and supported by Barbara, a mother mentor to me. Now that my kids are teenagers, it is not uncommon for me to hear them singing along with whatever yoga music is playing while I practice, cook, or clean the house. (I'm fairly certain that my children are the only ones in their class who rock out to Krishna Das while doing the dishes.) It is my hope that as they grow more and more into their own place in this world, they will come back to the practice of yoga to support their journeys. So every Monday, when I get to \"work,\" I say a prayer of deep gratitude to my children, who taught me to breathe, slow down, and savor each moment of being a mother. I send thanks to Barbara Linderman and all my yoga teachers along the way who taught me to share this beautiful practice with others. I then roll out my mat, clear my mind, and await the arrival of mamas and babies, and their bright, expectant, joy-filled energy. My hope in offering the Yoga for Mamas class is that the women and children who attend will also learn to use yoga as a tool in supporting their own journeys through the rich path of becoming a family. I am grateful for each and every mama and baby as they share a part of their journey with me. The Divine Light of mama love shines bright.

Book Signing and Talk with Dr. Elizabeth Shadigian, author of WomanSafeHealth: The Antidote to Status Quo Health Care April 22, 7 p.m. at Crazy Wisdom Tea Room Drawing on the actual experiences of women, WomanSafeHealth uses cartoons and humor together with analysis and compassion to reveal what it means to meet a woman's health care needs. Status Quo Health Care is a term coined at WomanSafe-Health to describe the poisoned care most women experience - hurried, depersonalized, cold, disrespectful, profit-driven - care that neglects her individual story and choices. At WomanSafeHealth, each woman is a person - not a disease, a client or a number. Prescrib-ing self-awareness, care analysis, and personal empowerment as antidotes to Status Quo Health Care, Elizabeth affirms what every woman already knows: safety and respect must be the core of health care.

And do they know how to party! Their antics can go on for numerous pages, involving all sorts of outrageous projects, which always lead nowhere. As it turns out, the discursive human mind acts in a similar way. It constantly unleashes Things One and Two to play their favorite games, in the process forming endless pairs of opposites, which further mutate into concepts ranging from A to Z. The two-ness of the mind is one of its most basic features, and as pairs of opposites are created, they often become allergic to each other. \"This\" becomes allergic to \"that,\" \"I\" becomes allergic to \"you,\" \"good\" becomes allergic to \"bad,\" and \"happy\" becomes allergic to \"unhappy.\" Of course, such distinctions can be useful in navigating conventional life experiences. But from a broader perspective, the words may seem a bit arbitrary when one always sees \"this\" in the context of \"that.\" For example, the next time you experience a feeling you would identify as \"sad\" or \"empty,\" look around and see if there isn't also the presence of something you might even call \"happy\" or \"full.\" It is good to know the undivided wholeness of our experience. If we try to pull \"this\" out of the total flow of events in which it occurs, it is rendered a mere thing, an orphaned phenomenon. None of this would necessarily be a problem if it were not for the fact that the heart, the wiser counterpart to the discursive mind, does not like to raise its voice. People who come to meditation may say they want to learn it for relaxation, purification, transcendence, or any number of reasons. But upon actually meditating, they soon find that they have really come to listen to the whispering, sometimes stammering, heart. Eventually, they will be guided to a place beyond all notions of \"one\" and \"two\" \u2014 a place inhabited by the heart, which has been quietly and patiently waiting for them to just show up. Although very few people come to meditation practice in order to become more vulnerable and available to the world, it is usually the first result that is most noticeable. In fact, the main reason I teach meditation is for the honor of being present when this starts to occur. It is amazing to witness a wonderful kind of alchemy, made possible by the practice of meditation, that mixes attention and pain together and ends up with kindness and wisdom. While such grace will develop naturally through meditation, it can also be helped through the offering of blessings. The offering of blessings is a directed practice that works to bring into full awareness the resistance \"this\" feels to \"that.\" It helps us see how our hearts have been hurt by disappointment and loneliness. With this awareness, we may finally be able to have compassion for ourselves, which makes compassion for others possible. The Buddhist traditions include several ways to offer blessings. In the tradition known as the \"Path of the Elders,\" blessings can be expressed to others and oneself in the form of internal statements such as, \"May you be happy,\" or \"May you be free from suffering.\" Although this approach is traditionally taught as part of sitting practice, I believe it can be at least as beneficial when practiced during the activities of everyday life. For example, you might see someone at the grocery store who seems to be having a difficult day. Offering this person a blessing could be as simple as silently sending the wish, \"May you know that you are loved.\" Notice how it feels as the heart tentatively starts to speak for itself, making its presence known and available. Because of how habitually hard we are on ourselves, it probably will not occur to you to offer these same wishes to yourself. It may be difficult, but simply note your resistance to comforting yourself, and attempt to do it anyway. When you offer a self-blessing, you acknowledge that out of all the people you have hurt in your life, the one you have hurt the most is yourself. In the tradition known as \"The Thunderbolt Vehicle,\" there is not only the outward offering of comfort to others, but the imagined breathing in of their suffering. Now, this really goes against the grain! You will naturally want to hold on to all the good stuff for yourself and let others keep their suffering, not letting it affect you. But all efforts to build immunity from others' pain are in themselves painful! The process of letting go of our immunization is known as tonglen , or \"taking and sending.\" Its long-term practice can be extremely beneficial to anyone who undertakes it. In a recent visit to the U.S., the Dalai Lama himself remarked that the practice of sending and taking continues to help him enormously in gaining and maintaining inner strength. Taking and sending can cut directly through the mischief of Things One and Two by challenging notions of \"me\" as separate from \"you.\" As you practice, you become aware that the suffering you perceive to be outside of you always takes place within the context of the suffering you feel internally. The process also plays with notions of \"yours\" and \"mine\" because in effect you are saying, \"Here, I will take all the bad stuff I thought was yours, and I will give you all the good stuff I thought was mine.\" If you are like me, you will probably find yourself in a situation with a difficult person as early as tomorrow. This is the perfect person with whom to practice taking and sending. Simply, and with patience for yourself, bring that person's anger, pain, or confusion into yourself on the in-breath and send whatever feeling of comfort you can offer on the out-breath. This is hard, and if you find yourself unable or unwilling to do it at first, simply try again. Watch for any form of magical thinking that tries to convince you that this exercise will somehow make you sick or prove that you are a masochist in some way. The point is not to put yourself down or to take on pain you cannot handle. Rather, it is to allow for a growing resonance with the wise heart. I hope you will try these simple exercises as you go about your day. Space does not permit in-depth exploration of the traditional methods here, but you should know that blessing practice works well when \"home-grown\" \u2014 when it comes from your own intuitive sense of generosity. You can learn to befriend Thing One and Thing Two. David has been practicing various forms of meditation for over 25 years, and has been teaching ongoing classes and retreats in a variety of settings for the past 15 years, mostly through Deep Spring Center. He is especially interested in helping practitioners access their own \"in-dwelling wisdom.\" He is now in the process of forming a new meditation group in the Ann Arbor area and can be reached at ldlawson@sbcgobal.net or davlawson3@gmail.com or by calling (734) 662-83177. I The two-ness of the mind is one of its most basic features . Meditation T eacher David Lawson reading The Cat in the Hat to his son, Ben. The Cat has two helpers, Thing One and Thing Two, who create \"maximum mischief \" wherever they go. Not unlike the human mind, forming endless pairs of opposites. The Buddhist traditions include several ways to offer blessings. In the tradition known as the \"Path of the Elders, \" blessings can be expressed to others and oneself in the form of internal statements such as, \"May you be happy, \" or \"May you be free from suffering. \"When you offer a self-blessing, you acknowledge that out of all the people you have hurt in your life, the one you have hurt the most is yourself. Although very few people come to meditation practice in order to become more vulnerable and available to the world, it is usually the first result that is most noticeable.. . . the heart, the wiser counterpart to the discursive mind, does not like to raise its voice.Childbirth (continued) Top Seven Questions About Becoming a Doula with Center for Childbearing Year Jan. 6, Feb. 3, Mar. 3 or April 7; 8-9 p.m. Join us for an interactive teleseminar designed to explore whether or not becoming a doula is right for you.

The art can hold my emotions nonjudgmentally, allowing me to give space and attention to difficult emotions. That is often all our emotions demand of us: to be released, to be felt for what they are. Buddhist philosophy differentiates between actual suffering, such as the loss of a job, and unnecessary suffering, which might be caused due to persistent thoughts such as I will never get another job or I'm going to end up homeless . Art therapy helps us see the difference in a concrete way, materialized in front of us through the manipulation of resources. In the beginning exists the story, suffering, or symptoms that are interrupting a harmonious and peaceful life. Sometimes there is no identifiable trouble, but just the desire to listen to what the psyche has to say, what is dormant inside of us. For most of us, there is a general need to slow down, to take the time to attend to internal messages, and to replace our inner critic with curiosity and nonjudgmental observation. The art therapy journey starts with materials. I find it helpful to surround my clients and myself with a variety of materials that could find their \"just-right place\" in any given moment. Materials range from the more common pencils, paints, and clay to photography, film, fabric, magazine cutouts for collage, finds from the backyard (such as sticks or grapevines), and objects from a junkyard (such as a mangled car door that survived a deadly crash), to name a few. Given any object can be used as an art material, I do a lot of recycling \u2014 tissue paper, food containers, old T-shirts and books, or used boxes end up being stored for potential use later. A \"The Fading Leaf \" (multimedia on canvas) is part of a series of horse paintings that will be auctioned in support of \"Return to Freedom \" \u2014 a nonprofit that is dedicated to preserving the freedom, diversity, and habitat of wild horses. Art therapists around the U.S. are creating art fundraisers for humanitarian projects. By Sibel Ozer | Artwork by Sibel Ozer \"Art therapy is not about rendering likeness, but about finding authentic expressions for our inner experiences.\" \"Something interesting happens inside of us when we let the hands engage in doing/playing/creating outside of us.\" \"For most of us, there is a general need to slow down, to take the time to attend to internal messages, and to replace our inner critic with curiosity and nonjudgmental observation.\"\"Kibele\" (grapevines stitched to canvas) represents settling into our new lives in Michigan. I was thrilled to find wild grape vines in our back yard and excited about the idea to sew them onto the canvas. It's about being held by Mother Nature, and feeling inner piece in her embrace. non-artist friend asked for help with a painting she had started a year ago. I suggested we do some foraging for inspiration, and we spent a day antiquing, visiting the art museum, stopping by an art store, and hunting for materials in her backyard. Next, we cleared her garden table for a day of painting, where I modeled free expression. She is not yet finished, but definitely no longer stuck either. The practice of art therapy can help us get \"unstuck,\" not only with a painting, but also with everyday personal, professional, and social challenges. There are few things I like more than getting creative juices flowing, and giving others and myself the permission to exercise our freedom to choose and to experiment with possibilities. Something interesting happens inside of us when we let the hands engage in doing/playing/creating outside of us. Carl Jung said that the hands know how to solve a riddle with which the intellect has wrestled in vain. When we respond to issues related to life through art, guided imagery, sand tray, or creative writing, we are able to access our inner wisdom \u2014 the part of us that is wiser than our problem-solving minds. Images and words reveal symbols that offer the best alternative representation of what is not yet known but very important to the psyche. We all have an untapped creative potential we can activate to help live our lives in a less restricted and more authentic manner. The goal is to strive for honesty. Art therapy is not about rendering likeness, but about finding authentic expressions for our inner experiences. I like to offer process-painting workshops, which take place over two months. We work the same canvas using color and texture over and over, letting go of forms as they emerge and practicing present centered representations of inner experiences. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 97 Each material holds numerous metaphors, offering us myriad opportunities through their different qualities. For example, pencils might present control when our life is unraveling, while finger paints bid you permission to let go of restraint if there is too much of it in your life at the moment. Fabric can impart a sense of connectedness during grief, while wood can support grounding in the midst of change. Different materials call up different responses for each of us, depending on timing and situation. Allowing ourselves to merely engage with them \u2014 to play, shape, mold, or transform \u2014 creates opportunities for insight, learning, and healing. The process is another distinct part of art therapy that can be equally fascinating and revealing. It could involve combining narrative, image, and music to create a digital story, or painting and repainting the same canvas practicing non-attachment to form that might lead to a visual emotional journal articulated through time and texture. Around the U.S., art therapists help veterans transform old combat uniforms to paper to express the inexplicable. Others change little matchboxes into precious art pieces and participate in painting marathons to raise awareness and money to help victims of human trafficking overseas. A woman in a private office desiring motherhood creates a shrine that holds and manifests the dream of parenting. A little girl on the cancer ward creates a doll to express her sadness at losing her hair due to chemo. The process is what we end up doing with the materials, which results in further growth and awareness. A third component of art therapy is the final product, the art piece. It can be burned, hidden, transformed all over, framed and exhibited, dialogued with, or gifted \u2014 whatever ends up being most therapeutic in a given moment. We can wind up with insight, clarity, the ability to communicate in a nonverbal way, or a way to memorialize and honor. We might create new bonds with the deceased or the living, make meaning, or simply find a workable rephrase. The possibilities for inspiration, guidance, and healing are as endless as the variability inherent to the materials, process, and product.

Nia, you treat people with allergies using a natural approach. Can you explain more about your background and how you apply it to treating allergies? A. My training in non-drug, non-toxic therapies was part of my four-year naturopathic doctor program at the Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Education in Mount Pleasant, Michigan. In addition, I took some Traditional Chinese Medicine classes at Bastyr University in Seattle involving the acupuncture points of the meridian system. I apply acupressure using just my fingertips. I do not use needles since I am not trained in acupuncture. Along with acupressure points, some of the modalities that many allergies respond well to include homeopathic remedies, herbs, better or different food choices, essential oils, gentle detoxification, and immune system strengthening. I have kept up my education through my 30-plus years in the wellness, fitness, and natural health profession. Q. What exactly is an allergy? A. In simple terms, an allergy is when the immune system has an abnormal response to anything that is normally fine for the other eight people in the crowd. An allergen is the thing causing or triggering the negative response. A person can be exposed to an allergen by eating or drinking it, inhaling it, touching it, and putting it on the skin or under the skin. Some folks claim that by just looking at it, they get an allergic reaction. (I tend to believe that one because I can gain weight just by looking at ice cream and doughnuts.) Q. How do you work with clients on strengthening their immune system?A. I recommend as many local greens, fresh vegetables, and fruits as possible. High quality fish oil and garlic can do wonders. I also teach herb classes, so I cannot leave out dandelion, plantain, mallow, and chickweed, which are very nutritive. For some people, I have used different forms of bodywork and energy therapies, such as Light Healing Touch and Meridian Balancing. These provided much needed relief. The client and I work together on eliminating toxins that accumulate in the body and produce an overload on the immune system, digestive system, respiratory system, and so forth. Q. Did you know at a young age that you wanted to pursue a career in natural living? What or who inspired you?A. My childhood inspirations for natural living included Euell Gibbons (the wild herb guy who later appeared in the Grape-Nuts cereal commercial), Paul Bragg (the originator of Health Food Stores and of Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar), and Jack LaLanne (the exercise guru and later his own juicer). As long as I can remember, my dad had Jack tuned in on our small, black-and-white, rabbit-eared television set. I shared this story in one of my older adult exercise classes, and one participant said, \"And, look, you are still doing it!\" Q. What type of allergies do you commonly treat? A. Cat and dog dander allergies are by far the most common animal allergies that I see. One client was allergic to a family member's cat and two dogs and was only able to stay in the house for one hour before it became too difficult to breathe. I worked on specific acupressure points and gave her two homeopathic remedies for her unique situation. She is still fine, and it has been five years. I also see people allergic to plants, pollens, dust, and mold. One plant in particular \u2014 ragweed \u2014 is the real culprit for many people. It likes to grow in many of the same areas as goldenrod, which often takes the blame. Food allergies such as dairy, wheat, shell fish, potatoes, and chocolate are also common.By Julianne Popovec | Photos by Tobi Hollander Some of the modalities that many allergies respond well to include homeopathic remedies, herbs, better or different food choices, essential oils, gentle detoxification, and immune system strengthening.Questions for Naturopathic Doctor Nia Aguirre on Natural Options for Allergies, Sensitivities, and Intolerances One plant in particular \u2014 ragweed \u2014 is the real culprit for many people. It likes to grow in many of the same areas as goldenrod, which often takes the blame. GoldenrodThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 109 It is exciting, and, at times, challenging to work uniquely with each individual and help facilitate positive changes. Q. What happens to the body after it has been exposed to an allergen? A. Keeping it simple, once the allergen is inside the body, an antibody called IgE is produced. This antibody attaches to mast cells found in various areas of the body, especially the airways, gastro-intestinal tract, mouth, nose, and below the surface of the skin. The allergens then bind to the IgE, which causes the mast cells to release a host of chemicals into the bloodstream, mainly histamine. Histamine is famous for causing most of the symptoms of an allergic reaction. These reactions can be mild, moderate, or severe. A mild reaction, a sensitivity, can make you feel like something is wrong, but not much happens. A moderate reaction, an intolerance, can make you feel ill, as in having a lactose intolerance that produces bloating, cramps, and flatulence. A severe allergic reaction can be extremely uncomfortable or life-threatening, as in the case of a peanut allergy or a bee sting. Q. How do you determine which treatments will work best for someone? A. The natural program for allergy relief is often a combination of therapies, which build upon each other. Yet, recall the person allergic to dogs and cats. She was fine after one appointment and her remedies. She followed her program and healed. Some bodies need more support than others. What works for one person may not be the best program for the next person. I take this approach when designing a program for allergies or any other condition. I am not a \"cookie cutter\" naturopath, herbalist, fitness specialist, and therapeutic bodyworker. No one receives the exact same program and handouts. It is exciting, and, at times, challenging to work uniquely with each individual and help facilitate positive changes.

When yoga became famous in the 60's in the U.S., it was an esoteric set of poses and breathing exercises to aid meditation. It was initially presented as a map to living our lives by following a kind of yogic Ten Commandments. Not very many people knew about yoga, and those who did were not \"normal,\" but considered hippies or society's outliers. Now, everyone knows what yoga is \u2014 ask anyone: your friends talking over lattes at Starbucks, your granny doing \"senior yoga,\" or possibly your mechanic who knows all the \"down-dog\" jokes. From P .E. classes to rowing teams, preschoolers and teenagers will tell you: Yoga is cool; everyone does yoga! The problem is they all have different answers to the question: What is yoga? Since the 60's, yoga has gone through many transformations, falling in sync with whatever cultural evolutions were happening in the U.S. But what has it become now? Primarily, yoga is being sold to us as just another exercise health craze (like aerobics was in the 80's) or the new \"Fountain of Youth\" for aging Baby Boomers. At its worst, yoga has become a kind of gymnastics divested of its other equally important parts. Strangely enough, yoga's chameleon nature is why it attracts people from many walks of life. The great diversity of those practicing yoga reflects the notion that yoga can be all things to all people. An exercise. A therapy for backache. A set of stretches for flexibility. A great sweat detox and diet aid. An escape. A religion. An ancient tradition with all of the answers. Or, for some, just a great way to meet girls in those skin-tight yoga pants. From hot and sweaty yoga to slow therapeutic yoga, from the more bizarre yoga classes for your dog to my personal favorite \u2014 breakdancing yoga \u2014 there seems to be a class out there to please everyone. No matter your background, your interests, or your age, there is a type of yoga for you. While this smorgasbord may confuse some people, it points to the deeper message that yoga carries \u2014 at its heart, yoga is essentially inclusive. Because of its ever changing nature, it's something you can grow old with. Yoga is not just a passing fad; it's here to stay. But beware. What initially attracts you to yoga and what gets you in the studio door may not be what keeps you going back every week. The \"side-effects\" of yoga are amazing. You might try a class because your back hurts but find that, after a few months, your back is not only better, but you are also more relaxed and sleeping better too. You might come to yoga because you want to lose weight and then find that, yes, you do lose weight, but that's not your main focus anymore; instead, you actually feel better about yourself at the weight you are now. You may just come to recognize yoga as a system that simply covers it all \u2014 an activity that we need to do daily like brushing our teeth. Yoga gives us the time and space to focus on our basic needs. Every day we get up and go through our busy routines, not making time for the things we really need. We need to sweat a bit, exercise, and stretch like a cat or dog (look at their bodies and try to argue!). We need to feel the basic joy of moving our bodies around and get the oxygen and blood flowing. But the most basic need is just to breathe. We move so fast that we leave ourselves behind, allowing hardly any time to even breathe. We need to close our eyes and just be, understanding that The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal January - April 2014 Page 113 By focusing on the breath, we celebrate the simple fact that we are living beings and nothing more. the art of doing nothing is really an art. Yoga comes to rescue us from this modern malaise. It gives the breath a central role, allowing us to connect with the very core of our being. For me, if I can teach students to breathe, I don't care if they learn how to do a pretzel pose. I know breathing will change their life in some way, whether it's helping fight depression and stress or increasing awareness of the present moment. Just learning to breathe can make someone a much happier person and more equipped to deal with life's varied challenges. You might not be able to touch your toes, but it's much more important if you can deal with your mother-in-law better. The impact of breathing even off the mat can be enormous. Try breathing at stoplights when you're stressed \u2014 that's three minutes of relaxation right there. In the classes I teach, I try not to hide the basic premise of what yoga is under a lot of technical pose alignments or the use of Sanskrit words. I believe that muddies the message; yoga is not a special esoteric practice that an ordinary person can't do. Anyone can do it, even those with mobility limitations. If you can breathe, you can do yoga! By focusing on the breath, we celebrate the simple fact that we are living beings and nothing more. Just for that, yoga is worth trying. Never mind the crazy terms and the awkward positions \u2014 just breathe. To me, yoga is all of these things. It's a deep spiritual practice, but also an exercise, albeit a very well-devised exercise with thousands of years of trial and error behind it. But it's so much more. That's what keeps me excited. I know I have a lifetime ahead of me of yoga, an ever changing experience that will always offer something new and exciting. Yoga is not just a passing fad. You do not \"attain\" or \"get good at\" yoga. It grows and evolves with you. We are all on a journey, and we've got the rest of our lives to get there. Why be in a hurry to get to the end? Tatiana Knight is a registered yoga instructor and has been teaching for five years. She teaches at the Riverside Arts Center and the Ypsilanti Community Center. After 10 years as a modern dancer in Berkeley, California, and many years living around the world, her journey has brought her here. Tatiana is excited to support the growth of yoga in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, and spread it to the rest of the world \u2014 one breath at a time. Her website is www.y2yesyoga.com, and she can be reached via email: y2yesyoga@gmail.com.
