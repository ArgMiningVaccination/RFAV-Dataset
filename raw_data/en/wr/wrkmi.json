Who can receive it?", "sitename": "Forbes", "date": "2022-11-01", "cleaned_text": "While clinical [trials](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-granted-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation) are currently underway to provide RSV vaccines to pregnant women in order to protect their soon-to-be newborns from RSV infections, pediatric specialists have been administering an RSV \"vaccine\" for years. This vaccine, called palivizumab ( [Synagis](https://www.synagis.com/index.html)) isn't actually a vaccine. It is a preventative monoclonal antibody injection which has been available to high-risk infants since 1998. This therapy is administered as an injectable agent, thus was given the vernacular \"vaccine\" term, even though it is not a vaccine, nor does it act as one. It is an immune agent, providing antibody protection from severe RSV infections in vulnerable infants. It is given as an injection every month for five consecutive months. It was shown to reduce hospitalization by an [average of 50%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15170364/) in two large placebo-controlled double-blind studies which included a total of nearly 3,000 high-risk babies. Until recently, guidelines on which infants were candidates to receive the five-injection [Synagis](https://www.synagis.com/what-is-rsv.html) series were based on medical as well as seasonal criteria. Infants needed to be: - Born prematurely (at or before 35 weeks) and who are 6 months of age or less at the beginning of RSV season. - Have a chronic lung condition, called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), that needed medical treatment within the last 6 months, and who are 24 months of age or less at the beginning of RSV season. - Born with certain types of heart disease and who are 24 months of age or less at the beginning of RSV season. As one can see, the \"RSV season\" is now not as clearly delineated as it was in years past. Because we are now seeing critically ill infants suffer from RSV infections in the spring and summer months, the American Academy of Pediatrics has presented [updated guidelines](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/interim-guidance-for-use-of-palivizumab-prophylaxis-to-prevent-hospitalization/#:~:text=The%20AAP%20recommends%20initiating%20the,of%20a%20typical%20RSV%20season.) for use of Synagis during any time where a particular region is experiencing a surge of RSV cases: \"With the shift in seasonality noted in 2021 and the current regional variability in interseason RSV cases, the AAP continues to support the use of palivizumab in eligible infants in any region experiencing rates of RSV activity at any time in 2022 similar to a typical fall-winter season. The AAP recommends initiating the standard administration of palivizumab, which consists of 5 consecutive monthly doses.\" RSV, or respiratory syncytial (pronounced sin-si-shul) virus, has been known to be in widespread circulation since the 1950's or earlier. The term syncytium (sin-si-shum) refers to the fusion of cells infected by particular viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2 the virus responsible for Covid-19. These viruses act to cause respiratory cells to fuse, or stick together, making it difficult for the cells of the respiratory system, namely the small airways in the lungs, to function normally. This year we are seeing RSV infections return with a vengeance, after two years of very low infection rates. It commonly circulates between the late fall and early spring, presenting as something as mild as a cold to severe pneumonia. In years past, as well as in this one, infants considered to be high-risk for RSV-related pneumonia were hospitalized, and often placed on ventilators and pediatric intensive care units to support their inflamed lung tissue in order for it to heal. By mid-October, a month which is typically seen as just the beginning of an RSV season, [pediatric intensive care unit beds](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/virus-surge-childrens-hospitals-scrambling-rcna53891) were filled with RSV patients, requiring many hospitals to refer sick newborns and infants to hospitals in other cities, counties or even states. Elective admissions and surgeries for healthier infants and children were being postponed, hearkening back to the early days of the Covid pandemic, where hospital beds were filled with patients (primarily adults) suffering from severe Covid infections. At a time when hospitals in this country are [closing pediatric units](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/health/pediatric-closures-hospitals.html) altogether, as they are known to be less lucrative than adult beds, the glut of resources to care for the vulnerable continues to be upon us.
