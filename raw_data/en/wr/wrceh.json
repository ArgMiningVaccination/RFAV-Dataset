Verus, a fiduciary to the Board, provides general investment consulting services for the University 's $11 billion in assets under management across the Retirement Plan, Endowment Pool, and General Pool. In 2018, after a formal RFP process, the Board of Curators retained Verus as the general investment consultant. As has been past practice, the Board of Curators approves the appointment of the general investment consultant on an annual basis. The proposed fee for the upcoming year beginning on October 1, 2021 is $561,000. This represents a fee increase of approximately $150,000, driven by the University's increased demand for Alternatives Consulting services following recent asset allocation changes approved by the Board of Curators. At the November 2020 and February 2021 Board meetings, new asset allocation mixes were approved for the Retirement Plan and Endowment Pool, respectively. Target allocations to private equity were increased from 10% to 12% in Retirement and from 10% to 15% in Endowment. Target allocations to private debt were increased from 3% to 6% in Retirement and from 3% to 7% in Endowment. Further, recent modeling exercises for the General Pool have established a 15% target allocation to private debt. Verus plays a critical role in assisting staff with sourcing activities as well as initial and ongoing diligence efforts. An overview of Verus is attached for your review.

Below is a representative client list. *Preliminary assets under advisement as of June 30, 2021. Our Philosophy Our consulting capabilities follow a consistent and researchdriven approach that is governed by the following principles: OPEN - CONSENT - G - 7 September 2, 2021VERUS OVERVIEW 6 Manager Search and Research Our due diligence and manager search process follows a disciplined approach in assessing and selecting managers. In evaluating current investment managers, we employ quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate the following: (1) firm, process, people and product set; (2) asset class investment and competitive environment; (3) appropriate balance between fee structures and opportuni ty set over the long term and in current market conditions; (4) risk, style, size and other factor exposures, and the effect of different market envi ronments on expected outcomes. In selecting managers, we evaluate the role of the potential manager within the context of the total plan, specifically: (1) specific need in the client portfolio: the risk fact or exposures and market beta exposures required, along with appropriate fee and cost levels, (2) manager's expected contributions to total and active risk; (3) assessment regime through which the manager will be viewed and ensuring time frame and approach are appropriate; (4) set clear expectations and expected outcomes on multi p le dimensions for both client and manager. Our manager research process goes beyond mere provision of data and focuses instead on finding investment solutions with a reliable, repeatable approach capable of producing return over the long term. Investment products we recommend have been through a multistage vetting process. At each stage, the universe becom es narrower and the investigation into the individual product is done in greater depth. A key feature of our manager research approach is the use of multiple lenses to evaluate and test investment managers and investment products. We recognize that skillful investme nt management relies on a combination of philosophies, attributes, ownership structures, incentive compensation schemes, professional capabilities, and organizational resource in addition to the standard metrics defined as process. We take a skeptical approach to evaluation of investment products, testing the thesis that an investment product can add value over multiple business cycles and also meet various client requirements. Database Verus tracks thousands of managers across the full range of asset classes at varying levels of depth, as follows: Client Managers - We closely monitor thousands of unique strategy exposures that are being employed by more than 152 clients. Approved List of Investment Products and Strategies - Verus maintains a list of 150 strategies in which we have the highest conviction, and which we believe to be most appropriate to addressing varying client performance objectives. These comprise the strategies that we recommend to our clients for new allocations and continue to proactively complete operational and investment due diligence on. OPEN - CONSENT - G - 8 September 2, 2021VERUS OVERVIEW 7 Inhouse Database of Managers - Our proprietary database, which houses our history of meeting notes and analyses of investment managers and their products, contains data on hundreds of managers across hundreds of strategies that our research and consulting staff have met with. External Databases - Through our external database we can track and screen managers across the full range of asset class e s, both traditional and alternative: eVestment Alliance - Quantitative and qualitative data on over 1600 managers, over 30,000 traditional longonly vehicles and over 23,000 alternative investment strategies Morningstar Direct - 131,000 openend funds, 31,000 stocks, 14,600 closeden d funds, 9,300 separate accounts composites and 8,200 hedge funds Aksia - More than 2,000 hedge funds tracked Burgiss Group Private I - More than 9,500 funds (private equity, VC funds, real assets, real estate, distressed debt, energy and fundoffunds) Neither Verus nor the thirdparty providers charge fees for inclusi on in the databases. A manager simply has to submit and periodically update firm and performance data to be included. Performance Measu rement Our performance measurement services cover the major public and private market asset classes. Our main tool for performance measurement is the InvestorForce Performance Reporting Network (iPRN), which allow us to drive greater operational efficiencies in several key areas including data aggregation, performance calculation and realtime analysis into client, manager and marke ting movement as well as the timely, automate d pr oduction of performance reports. Verus uses iPRN, Style Research, and our own proprietary systems to provide portfolio analytics. Our standard performance measurement reporting package includes the following sections: Executive Summary, Capital Markets Review, Asset Allocation Review, Performance Detail and Total Fund, Asset Class and Manager Levels, and Performance Attri bution and Analytic s. Private Markets Consulting Many of our clients allocate 3%30% of their assets to the private markets (buyouts, venture capital, debtrelated and international investments). As in public markets investments, we apply the \"three legs\" of managing an investment program to the private markets arena: strategic planning, policy implementation, and monitoring. Specifically, we assist our clients in the following areas: Review of current alternative investments program Private mark ets education Restructuring of current program Private markets asset class allocation program OPEN - CONSENT - G - 9 September 2, 2021VERUS OVERVIEW 8 Development of private markets investment policy and guidelines Partnership reviews and recommendations Due diligence reviews of current and prospective partnerships Ongoing oversight and performance measurement of private markets investments We have a dedicated consulting team, who specialize in private markets consulting. We use a combination of inhouse research, due diligence, and thirdparty databases to support our efforts, including Private i, a robust database and performanc e measurement application developed by The Burgiss Group, and VentureXpert, published by Thompson Financial. We believe that success in this asset class is not a random occurrence, but a discipline that can be monitored and replicated - both by the general partners and the plan sponsor - and we help provide that discipl in e through our services. Trustee Education Verus develops educational programs for our clients' trustees, typically as an integral part of the strategic planning/asset allocation process. We have conducted various types of onsite training and education workshops for institutional investors covering topics, such as: Fiduciary Responsibility Performance Measurement Securities Lending Mortgage Backed Securities Asset Allocati on Investment Industry Evolution New Tr ustee Education Option Strategies International Investing 401(k) Participation Capital Market Theory Venture Capital Investing Overlay Implementation Alternative Investments Manager Search Emerging Markets Hedge Funds Biographies Mr. Jeffrey MacLean Chief Executive Officer Mr. MacLean joined Verus in 1992 and is primarily responsible for managing the firm and providing investment advice to several clients.

Responsibilities and Authorities - See CRR 140.010 \" Policy for Management and Oversight of Selected University Investment Pools.\" C. Investment Objectives -- The Endowment Pool must be m anaged to provide ongoing support of endowed programs in perpetuity, in conformance with donor stipulations. To accomplish this, investment returns, net of inflation, should be sufficient over time to cover annual spending distributions while maintaining or growing the underlying purchasing power of each endowed gift. Endowment Pool investments should be managed in a manner that maximizes returns while attempting to minimize losses during adverse economic and market events, with an overall appetite for risk governed by the objectives noted above. This will be accomplished through a more 'risk -balanced' portfolio that seeks meaningful diversification of assets, which necessarily means less equity risk and more long- term bond exposure relative to peers. To of fset potentially lower returns from a more risk -balanced portfolio, a key component of this strategy includes a less common, yet prudent, program of return enhancement commonly referred to in the investment industry as portable alpha. These investment objectives seek to prioritize the long -term structural needs of the Endowment Pool over short -term performance comparisons of the investment portfolio relative to peers. D. Authorized Investments - The Endowment Pool shall be invested in externally managed funds, consistent with the guidelines established in CRR 140.011, \" Policy for Investment Manager Selection, Monitoring and Retention \" and CRR 140.017, \" Allowable Investments, \" in the following asset classes: REDLINE September 2 , 2021 OPEN - CONSENT - H-4 E.

F. Currency Risk Management In the context of a global investment por tfolio, currency risk exists to the extent that investments contain exposures to foreign currencies. The desirability of this currency exposure is not necessarily aligned dollar for dollar with the desired exposure to assets denominated in foreign currenc ies. As such, external managers in any asset class may implement currency strategies to alter the currency exposure of the portfolio when deemed prudent to do so in the context of the particular investment mandate. In addition, the University may utilize external managers to implement currency strategies to alter exposures in an active or passive manner as part of a portfolio or asset class overlay when deemed prudent to do so. G. Portable Alpha Program Synthetic market exposures across asset classes including equities, sovereign bonds, inflation -linked bonds and commodities may be obtained through derivative instruments commonly accepted by other institutional investors, such as futures, swaps, options, forward contracts and reverse repurchase agreements. Th ese derivative instruments shall be managed by external investment firms with appropriate expertise, experience and depth of resources. When synthetic market exposures are obtained through derivative instruments, a portion of the resulting cash and cash equivalent balances may be invested by active alpha managers seeking to add returns over the benchmark. These alpha managers will possess broadly diverse strategies/styles and, in the aggregate, are expected to produce returns that show little or no relationship to the economic environment being experienced at any given time. Furthermore, this portfolio of managers will be constructed with a goal of low/no correlation to the synthetic market exposures obtained through the derivative instruments. The risk drivers with the portable alpha portfolio should generally be well -known, empirically -tested, sources of return that can be systematically harvested through dynamic long/short strategies. They can be thought of either as returns that underlie \"classi c\" hedge fund strategies (hedge fund risk premia), such as arbitrage and macro or the returns from \"classic\" styles (style premia), such as value, momentum, carry, defensive and low volatility. Legal account structures will be in the form of one or a combi nation of separate accounts, institutional commingled funds and/or limited partnerships or other similar forms. The allowable range of the portable alpha portfolio shall be 0 -27% of the total Endowment Pool. Management of liquidity risk is a critical compo nent of the portable alpha program. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk that synthetic market exposures may need to be unwound at undesirable points in time in order to meet margin calls during volatile markets. To help mitigate this risk, prudent balances of cash and cash equivalents shall be maintained as part of the program and monitored daily.

H. Spending Policy - To provide ongoing support to endowed programs in perpetuity, the spending policy must be managed in conjunction with investment objectives and other factors in compliance with applicable law, such that the spending rate plus an inflationary assumption shall not exceed expected investment returns over time. At minimum, the spending policy should be reviewed in conjunction with asset/liability studies performed by the Investment Consultant not less than once every three years. 1.

September 2, 2021 OPEN - CONSENT - I-1 Sole Source 340B Contract Pharmacy & Specialty Pharmacy Distribution Services MUHC In accordance with the Collected Rules and Regulations 80.010, MU Health Care (MUHC) requests approval for the sole source purchase of 340B Contract Pharmacy & Specialty Pharmacy Distribution Services from Cardinal Health Inc, Dublin, Ohio, for a n estimate d total of $20,750,000 for a five-year term with the option to renew for two additional one - year terms . The agreement for 340B Contract Pharmacy Distribution Services would be for the purpose of 340B pharmaceutical purchases as they relate to MUHC's 340B contract pharmacy services agreement s with Optum, Kroger/ Gerbes, and Hy-Vee. MUHC's 340B contract pharmacy arrangement s with these pharmacies were originally effective as of April 13, 2017 (Hy- Vee), September 14, 2020 (Kroger/Gerbes) , and (Optum). Under these arrangements, Hy -Vee, Kroger/Gerbes, and Optum serve as contract pharmacies that dispense 340B drugs purchased by MUHC to eligible patients of MUHC. These 340B contract pharmacy arrangement s produce /will produce an estimated annual net revenue of $6,350,000. Optum and Kroger/Gerbes utilize, and Hy-Vee will utilize (as of December 1, 2021) , Cardinal Health as their normal drug distributor. MUHC tried to utilize McKesson , its primary drug distributor, for these contract pharmacies, however McKesson cannot meet their operational needs due to these contract pharmacies not being primary customer s of McKesson. These contract pharmacies require use of their primary distributor for drug acquisition in order to obtain daily deliveries and eliminate disruptions in their operations. MUHC evaluated whether a Vizient group purchasing contract could be used for this arrangement with Cardinal Health, but it is not an option. In order to maintain existing agreemen ts with these contract pharmacies, MUHC would like to establish a distributor relationship with Cardinal Health only for these 340B contract pharmacies . 340B contract pricing is a national standard, so irrespective of the wholesaler utilized, pharmaceut ical purchase prices are the same. MUHC will not see cost increases due to the addition of a secondary wholesaler . MUHC also reviewed our current contract with McKesson and Vizient and found this change would not negatively impact MUHC's contract complia nce with McKesson . This conversion would add minimal operational changes and provide significant value to the contracted pharmacies. In addition, MUHC Specialty Pharmacy has a need to purchase specialty pharmaceuticals from Cardinal Health that cannot be purchased direct ly from the manufacturers or McKesson. More and more specialty drugs are being routed to different wholesalers as the only avenue for procurement. As a result, in order for MUHC Pharmacy to purchase these specialty pharmaceuticals like Oncaspar, an oncology drug, it needs to establish a distributor relationship with Cardinal Health. The Vizient group purchasing organization September 2, 2021 OPEN - CONSENT - I-2 contract does not allow for secondary contracts through Vizient; however, Vizient allows members to establish secondary relationships on their own, as long as the relationship does not conflict with the primary distributor contract. Because these specialty pharmaceuticals are only available through Cardinal, this relationship will not negatively impact MUHC's contract compliance with McKesson. Annual revenue for purchases made from Cardinal for the specialty pharmacy is estimated to be $1,500,000. The annual pharmaceutical expenditure s will be paid from the Optum, Kroger/G erbes, Hy-Vee Contract Pharmacy , and Mizzou Pharmacy - Specialty operating funds.

Also enclosed is an annual investments review letter from Verus, the University's General Investment Consultant. The Collected Rules and Regulations require annual performance reporting to the Board for each of the following investment pools: Retirement Plan Represents the invested assets of the University's defined benefit plan , which serves more than 34,000 members. Endowment Pool Holds more than 6, 200 endowment accounts from across the UM System. General Pool Contains the cash, reserves and invested assets of more than 25,000 unique operating units within the UM System. September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-2 Investment Performance Review Fiscal Year 2021 Office of Investments Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-3 Update from the CIO Driven by exceptional performance across the board, assets under management grew to $11 billion in Fiscal Year 20 21, with net investment income boosting the Retirement Plan , Endowment Pool and General Pool by approximately $1 billion , $500 million and $175 million, respectively. Beyond the strong absolute returns provided by markets, we were able to deliver exceptional value through manager selection and tactical portfolio positioning with excess returns over benchmark totaling approximately $295 million across the three portfolios. Our portable alpha program delivered strong results, providing 1.9% of the Retirement Plan's 4.7% excess return and 1.8% of the Endowment Pool's 4.1% excess return. Across asset classes, nearly everything delivered meaningful returns with particularly stro ng performance from Private Equity, Commodities, and Public Equity. In fact, the 62% return delivered by our Private Equity portfolios w as the strongest in that program's 17-year history. Risk Balanced continued to exceed expectations with an impressive 22% return. US Treasuries were the only asset class to deliver slightly negative returns due the rebound in the economy, which brought increases in interest rates. Clearly, every institutional portfolio has enjoyed the tailwinds of strong fiscal and monetary policy as the world emerged from the depths of the initial COVID -19 market shock in March 2020. Our alpha portfolio was hit particularly hard during that time, adversely impacting our performance in FY20 relative to benchmark. It's helpful to revisit the worst of that period given the context of what followed : January - June 2020 (6 Months) January 2020 - June 2021 (Cumulative) Actual Benchmark Excess Actual Benchmark Excess 0.1% The data illustrate s two main points, the first being that the performance of markets during FY21 was much more than just \"climbing out of the hole\" created by COVID -19 as the growth in FY21 has far exceeded losses sustained in the prior fiscal year. The second point is that our portfolios came back strongly in FY21, easily making up for the underperformance relative to the policy benchmark that occurred in FY20. As we look forward into FY22, caution prevails after booking these near historic returns in FY21. Yet the Federal Reserve continues to maintain extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy at the same time the government 's fiscal policy remains historically stimulative. How much more can markets run, with valuations across asset classes at all- time highs? Will inflation continue to exceed Fed forecasts and, if so, what impact will that have on interest rates? How will equities react to inflation and ri sing interest rates? Despite the uncertainly at every turn, we will stick to our strategy, maintaining reasonably diversified portfolios managed by world -class investment partners.

This performance easily beat the alpha portfolio's modeled expected return of 3.2%. These one- year returns from the alpha portfolio translate into approximately $69 million and $33 million in net investment income for the Retirement and Endowment portfolio. About two -thirds of the alpha managers generated returns above expectations. We will continue our search for new alpha managers, as we strive to diversify our sources of alpha and limit our exposure to any single manager to levels co nsistent with our risk appetite. Cash margins within t he portable alpha program have remained comfortably above our 30% targeted level.

Retirement and Endowment returned 41.2% and 41.8%, exceeding the benchmark by 1.9% and 2.5% , respectively. A ctive management was particularly strong, with all global equity managers outperform ing the benchmark, contributing approximately two - thirds of the excess return. The remaining one -third of the excess return was driven by a staff decision to overweight emerging markets relative to the benchmark - a decision driven by a belief that emerging m arket countries such as China and South Korea were in a better position to handle COVID -19 relative to developed nations, a bearishness on the U.S. Dollar, and a positive outlook for commodities. One potential headwind for public equity over the next 12 mo nths is inflation, which we are tracking carefully. Historically, higher than expected inflation has led to public equity underperformance, since companies face lower profit margin s and the Federal R eserve typically increase s rates to slow down the economy . This led us to shift our allocation to the asset class from overweight back to target with two months remaining in the fiscal year. Public Markets: US Treasuries Retirement $360 Million | Endowment: $ 167 Million Performance Nominal Yield Curve With interest rates increasing throughout the fiscal year, Retirement and Endowment portfolios returned ( 1.5% ) and (1.2% ), respectively . This performance was consistent with benchmark . Yields remained relatively unchanged over Q3 of 2020 ( with the 10 -year yield at 0. 7%), but saw a sharp increase during Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 with the 10- year yield rising to 1.7%. This sharp increase in yields was largely due to the market's anticipation of stronger growth and inflation following additional fiscal stimulus and the start of the COVID -19 vaccine 0.00%0.50%1.00%1.50%2.00%2.50% 3 Mo 2 Yr 3 Yr 5 Yr 7 Yr 10 Yr 30 YrJun-20 Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-9 rollout. Over the final quarter of the fiscal year, yields fell and the yield curve flattened on very strong demand for bonds. The 10 -year closed the f iscal year at 1. 5%. During the fiscal year, the policy benchmark was adjusted from the US Total Treasury Index, to the US Intermediate Treasury Index, in anticipation of a rising rate environment. While this adjustment did not contribute to performance relative to benchmark, it was additive to the absolute performance of the portfolio. Following the policy benchmark adjustment, the US Total Treasury Index returned ( 2.8% ) while the Intermediate Index returned ( Public Markets: Inflation -Linked Bonds Retirement $ 447 Million | Endowment: $ 211 Million Performance Breakeven Inflation Rate Inflation -Linked Bonds (ILBs) posted strong returns of 6.5% and 6.7% in Retirement and Endowment, respectively, consistent with benchmark . ILBs benefited from across -the-board favorable conditions: monetary easing that pushed discount rates (the forward real yield of cash) deeply negative, central bank bond buying that flattened yield curves and pushed risk premiums lower, and a rise in disco unted inflation. Breakeven inflation rates rose over the fiscal year, with the ten -year breakeven inflation rate increasing significantly, from 1.3% to a high of 2. 6% in May, before falling over the last few weeks of the fiscal year, closing at 2.33%. This increase in expectations for inflation to be higher was led by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy framework, progress in the distribution of vaccines, higher commodity prices and a potentially substantial Federal infrastructure deal.

The outperformance was driven by our active commodities strategy, which beat the benchmark by 19.5%. We continue to have strong confidence in the active strategy and expect the long -term excess return to be middle to high single digits. Although the asset class has recovered all its early 2020 losses, commodities still have not re turned to peak levels in 2008. Since the global economy has not yet fully recovered because of the uneven vaccine rollout and recent rise in COVID -19 cases of the \"delta\" variant, we believe the asset class continues to have more upside. In addition, some commodities price s stand to benefit from some structural supply deficit s in the near term given the underinvestment in the previous decade. Accordingly , we will continue to overweight the asset class. Public Markets: Risk Balanced Retirement $ 650 Million | Endowment: $ 316 Million Performance Contribution to Return Traditional Portfolio Risk Balanced Portfolio The Risk Balanced allocation experienced an exceptional year, returning 22.1% in Retirement and 21. 6% in Endowment. Over the past year, strong returns in equities, commodities, and inflation -linked bonds were all positive contributors to performance, with nominal bonds the only detractor. Risk Balanced seeks to balance the contribution to risk from each asset class that composes a diversified portfolio. A traditional portfolio, comprised of 60% equity / 40% fixed income, is not diversified from a perspective of investment risk , as approximately 90% of the portfolio risk is driven by the 60% capital allo cation to equities. Risk Balanced seeks to avoid this concentration of equity risk through the construction of a truly diversified portfolio, spreading risk exposures equally across each sector of the portfolio. Considerable efforts have been made over the past two years to enhance the risk balanced allocation, creating what we believe is a mix of managers effectively equipped to navigate unpredictable market environments. 0%20%40%60%80%100% Capital Allocation Risk ExposureEquities Bonds Inflation0%20%40%60%80%100% Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-11 Note: Private market asset classes report changes in valuation (i.e. performance) once per quarter on a one quarter lag. This means that the performance reported for private markets through June 30, 202 1 is based on March 31, 202 1 valuations. This one- quarter lag in reporting is common among institutional investors . Private Markets: Private Equity Retirement $ 502 Million | Endowment: $ 255 Million Performance Industry Distribution FY21 delivered the best one- year performance in our Private Equity program 's 17 -year history , with r eturn s of 62.1% and 62.5% for Retirement and Endowment , respectively, with both easily beating it's benchmark. Venture capital fund investments are responsible for a large portion of th ese exceptional returns, with several very successful IPOs over the past year . While the equity in some of the underlying compan y IPOs has been sold (realized) , there are still meaningful holdings of these public equities within our venture capital funds due to mandatory lock -up periods, etc . These remaining public equity holdings will magnify the volatility of our venture fund valuation s going forward , based on changes in public equity markets. Private Equity is a long- term investment with success measured over years, not quarters . The 10 -year annu alized returns of our private equity portfolios have been approximately 15%, consistent with benchmark. Perhaps the more interesting comparison is with our own public equity portfolios. Over the past 10 years, on an annualized basis, our private equity re turns have significantly exceeded our public equity returns by approximately 5.0%, which represents tremendous value over a long-time horizon.

The excess performance is attributed to approximately one-half of the real estate exposure allocated to multi- family and industrial assets - both representing overweight positions relative to the benchmark . These two property types also provided the best return opportunities over the past year . A corresponding underweight to retail and office properties also contributed to our excess return. Given the long- term nature of private real estate investments, success is measured over a longer time horizon. Over the past ten years, the real estate portfolio has delivered an annualized return of 10.2% and 10.3% for the Retirement and Endowment, respectively, outperforming the benchmark return of 7.3%. 3.5% Office of Investments Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-13 Private Markets: Private Debt Retirement $ 220 Million | Endowment: $ 88 Million Performance Industry Distribution Top 5 Private Debt returned 11.4% and 11.5% in Retirement and Endowment, respectively, trailing the benchmark by 0.7% and 1. 3% over the past year. While the Private Debt portfolio has trailed the benchmark over the past one- year period, it has outperformed the benchmark over the longer -term, exceeding the benchmark by 0.5% over three years and 1.2% over five years. The underperformance over the past year is largely due to a mismatch caused by using a public markets benchmark for private market assets. During periods of market volatility, this mismatch stands out in short term reporting. In March 2020, the public markets benchmark experienced a deep contraction, followed immediately by a strong recovery that lasted into the first part of FY 2021. Private assets are slower to r espond, and as we continue to move further away from the market turmoil of Q1 2020, many of our distressed and opportunistic strategies began seeing significant recoveries. Over the past six months, Private Debt has outperformed the benchmark by 2.1% in Retirement and 1.3% in Endowment, and as noted above, our longer term -performance remains above benchmark at three and five years. Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-14 General Pool $3.06 Billion Performance Historical FY Performance In terms of performance, the General Pool experienced a historic year , returning 7.7% while beating the benchmark by 3.0%. This excess return above benchmark equates to an additional $81 million in investment income for the General Pool . As a result of this exceptionally strong performance, we were able to generate a record high Strategic Dividend of $56.5mm for FY 2021. Benchmark outperformance was driven by strong active management in our fixed income and private debt allocations. Overall, significant gains in these sectors , as well as from our risk balanced allocation , helped offset the low interest rate environment that has significantly reduced our earning power within the liquidity portfolio (which represented approximately 36% of the overall General Pool balances as of June 30, 2021 ). The fixed income allocation returned 7.1%, easily beating its benchmark of 0.05%. As the economy continued to recover, holdings in corporate credit , as well as agency and non -agency mortgage -back ed securities , contributed to the strong outperforman ce. The Risk Balanced portfolio had similar strong performance, returning 21%, with gains in equities, commodities, and inflation all adding to the positive performance. The General Pool represents the working capital of all entities across the Universi ty System. As would be expected, the risk we are willing to take in the General Pool is lower than for the Retirement Plan or Endowment Pool. -2.0%0.0%2.0%4.0%6.0%8.0% FY 2003 FY 2004 FY Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-15 APPENDIX Office of Investments Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-16 Understanding a Portable Alpha Program Portable Alpha is a general concept that has existed within institutional portfolios in various forms for more than 20 years. It is rooted in the acknowledgement that investment portfolio total returns are driven by two distinct components - beta and alpha. Simplistically, beta results from owning some broad representation of a given market, usually as tracked by a benchmark or index. Alpha represents investing skill that generates returns independent of a given market benchmark or index. Using a publ ic equity manager as an example, one might invest with an active equity manager based on a belief that the manager's stock picking skill (alpha) will enable the manager to outperform the benchmark (beta). In this case, as with most traditional investment vehicles, the beta and alpha are packaged togeth er in the same product. The fundamental core belief of a Portable Alpha program is that beta and alpha can be separately sourced and more efficiently managed. The Mechanics of a Portable Alpha Program Let's start with a foundational example which illustrates three different options to obtain market exposure (beta), in this case a $100 million investment in the S&P 500. The first two options should be very familiar. We can invest $100 million in cash with an active manager with an expectation to achieve both a beta and alpha return or we can invest $100 million in cash with an index fund, content to receive just a beta return. The third option is available primarily to institutional investors with access to derivative markets. With this option, we can ke ep control of our $100 million in cash while using futures, a common derivative instrument, to obtaining $100 million in notional exposure 1 to the S&P 500 index. If we stopped here, the choice of the index fund or futures implementation would both deliver the same S&P 500 beta return. With the futures implementation, we maintain control of our $100 million in cash while still getting the $100 million notional return of the S&P 500. Retaining the cash is what allows us to source alpha, through another manager, separately from the market beta. Within the implementation of our own portable alpha program, we would use up to 70% ($70 million in this example) of the cash to fund separate investments in carefully selected alpha managers (generally in the form of hedge fund vehicles). The remaining 30% ($30 million in this example) would continue to be held in cash for purposes of covering the daily mark -to-market settlements on the futures implementation. 1 The notional amount of a derivatives instrument represents the market exposure upon which returns are exchanged. As an example, holding S&P 500 futures contracts with a notional amount of $100 million means we gain exposure to the S&P 500 index without having to expend $100 million in capital to purchase the underlying stocks. With a futures implementation, we simply exchange cash based on the S&P 500 index returns. As an example, if the S&P 500 dropped 1% we would have to pay the counterparty $1 millio n on $100 million in notional exposure; conversely, if the S&P 500 gained 1%, we would receive $1 million from the counterparty. Office of Investments Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-17 Alpha Manager Selection To properly manage risk in a portable alpha program, alpha managers must meet very specific criteria. The primary focus and challenge is to identify alpha managers that deliver return streams with very low correlations (no discernible relationship) to mar ket betas. We look for managers with market beta correlations of 0.2 or less2. Further, we will only partner with alpha managers that are well established and highly institutionalized, have satisfactory liquidity terms, and robust risk management systems. Many alpha managers meeting our criteria are closed to new investors, so identifying new managers requires patience and skill in manager selection. Successful alpha managers are, by definition, highly skilled. From a risk management perspective, hig hly skilled alpha managers are essential to the operation of a portable alpha program. With respect to pricing power, the demand in the marketplace currently exceeds the supply of highly skilled alpha manager capacity. For this reason, alpha managers charge higher fees than traditional managers. The magnitude of the higher alpha manager fees is somewhat mitigated by the very low, index -like fees of the market beta exposures obtained using the derivatives. All modeling, reporting and analysis of the alpha program and underlying alpha managers is always presented on a net of fee basis . Generating alpha is difficult and even the most seasoned, successful managers will go through periods of underperformance, sometimes incurring losses. It's important to rem ember that whenever we talk about an expected return, we're referring to the midpoint of a fairly wide range of possible outcomes over a longer time horizon. The cone chart to the left presents the alpha portfolio's cumulative actual return (red line) relative to the modeled expected return (green line). The thin blue lines represent one standard deviation of the expected return, meaning that 68% of all possible outcomes should fall within the thin blue lines. By definition, this means that 32% of possib le outcomes could fall outside the bounds of the thin blue lines. 5% of possible outcomes could fall outside the thick blue lines, which represent two standard deviations. This all suggests that, as investors, we must be prepared to endure periods of unc omfortable performance. Our alpha managers, whom we believe to be highly skilled, have navigated successfully through drawdowns in the past, and we maintain confidence that they will do so going forward as well. Q1 2020 was a very challenging period for the alpha portfolio , with the impact to cumulative returns shown transparently in the cone chart. At the same time, it is also clear that the portfolio's performance recovery is well underway through FY21, headed back toward the expected return. 2 Correlations are very important with respect to both risk management and value for fees. An alpha portfolio with higher corr elations to market betas (closer to 1.0) will add risk to the total portfolio as the alpha exposures would simply magnify the risk that already existed in the total portfolio. An alpha portfolio with low correlations to market betas (closer to 0.0) is diversifying to existing exposures in the total portfolio, actually helping to reduce overall portfolio risk through benefits of diversification. Wit h respect to value for fees, if we're paying higher fees for alpha, we need to be confident that we're actual ly getting alpha. I n very general terms, if an alpha manager were highly correlated public equities (closer to 1.0) , it would suggest that the alpha manager's returns could be explained largely by the returns of public equities. If that were the case, it would suggest that the alpha manager was charging high fees while delivering low cost beta returns. Office of Investments Annual Report: Fiscal Year 2021 September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-18 Risk Management A common concern with portable alpha programs, beyond their complexity, is the concept of \"leverage\" and a potential magnification of portfolio risk if not well managed. To be clear, there is no explicit \"borrowing\" involved in the funding o f the alpha po rtfolio - we are using our own cash, made available to us because of the capital efficiency of futures or other derivative instruments used to obtain our market beta. We maintain complete control over these derivative exposures, with the ability to reduce or eliminate the exposures in 24 hours or less. To be clear, a portable alpha program allows an investor the ability to obtain total exposures greater than amount of capital invested, which can also result in additional risk. However, a well- designed por table alpha program with prudent risk management practices can often reduce overall portfolio risk through greater portfolio diversification. From a practical perspective, one key component to successfully managing the day -to-day risk of a portable alpha program is the amount of cash set aside to fund the mark -to-market settlement demands of the derivative instruments used to implement the market betas. In our own case, based on extensive modeling and analysis, as noted above, we currently keep approximately 30% of the cash set aside for this purpose. In a recent real -world test, we are pleased to report that we maintained our 30% cash margin throughout the COVID -19 market crisis in March 2020, with absolutely no liquidity issues. Reasons to Maintain a P ortable Alpha Program Alpha within a portfolio is extraordinarily valuable, no matter how it is sourced. This is because of the additional return potential and lower overall risk resulting from the benefits of diversification. A thoughtfully designed portable alpha program significantly increases the odds of obtaining alpha as compared to the alternative of expecting excess returns from active managers in traditional market beta implementations as described above. In the modeling performed as part of the 2020 asset allocation studies for the Retirement Plan and Endowment Pool, the portable alpha program was modeled to deliver a 3.2% annualized return, net of fees. Sized at 22% of capital, that equates to an additional 0.70% return, net of fees for each p ortfolio in total. Based on current portfolio balances, averaged out over a market cycle, that equates to annual investment income, net of fees , of approximately $16 million and $31 million in Endowment and Retirement, respectively. In FY21, the actual re turns delivered by the portable alpha portfolio were approximately $62 million and $28 million in Retirement and Endowment, respectively. This incremental return can make a big difference over time on many levels.

Williams University of Missouri Board of Curators 316 University Hall Columbia, Missouri 65211 -3020 Verus is pleased to provide the University of Missouri Board of Curators with brief overview the performance of the Retirement Fund and Endowment, highlights of our engagement with the University of Missouri investment staff during the fiscal year ended June 30, 202 1, and our summary of the Market Environment . Plan Perfo rmance 1 Total return over the fiscal year was significantly positive for the Retirement Fund at 28.7% (net of fees) and slightly more positive for the Endowment Pool at 29.6% (net). Returns on the funds' policy benchmarks were similar, 24.0% for Retirement Fund and 25.4% for the Endowment, implying outperformance of their respective benchmarks by 4.7% and 4.1%. Both funds also greatly exceeded the return of the passive 60/40 benchmark, with the Retirement Fund and Endowment Pool outperforming by 5.4% and 6. 3% for the yea r, respectively. Public equities were a major driver of total fund performance for both plans. Public equity has a 32% target allocation in the Retirement Fund and 35% target in the Endowment Pool. Public equity performance was 41.2% for the year for the Retirement Fund and 41.8% for the Endowment. Equity sentiment can be seen in the U.S. market, with the S&P 500 achieving several milestones during the fiscal year, most notably closing at 3,500 in August 2020 and 4,000 in April of 2021, a sign that U.S. markets were soaring as the pandemic progressed toward its hopeful end. Global and international equities followed suit, with major indices also posting all-time highs during the fiscal year. Private equity was another lead driver of total fund performance. The Retirement Fund private equity returned 62.1% for the year, led by very strong performance in the venture capital space. The Endowment's private equity returned 62.5% for the year. These returns are significant for total performance, with a 10% target allocation to private equity in each plan. OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-25 September 2, 2021Real estate posted the largest excess return relative to policy during the year. The Retirement Fund real estate outperformed it's benchmark by 10.2% and the Endowment outperformed by 9.0%. The composite features core, value add, and opportunistic real estate. Opportunistic real estate was the top performer in both plans, returning 14.5% for Retirement Fund and 12.6% in the Endowment Pool. Value add real estate has the largest allocation in each plan and also performed well, producing returns of 12.2% and 10.9% for the Retirement Fund and Endowment Pool, respectively. The long- term (10 -year) results of both portfolios remain ahead of University objectives, with the Retirement Fund returning 8.1% (net) a nd the Endowment Pool returning 8.6% (net). These results are currently exceeding the 7.2% investment return actuarial assumption. This was a significant year for both plans. Ten -year annualized returns are up 0.8% for the Retirement Fund and 0.7% for the Endowment Pool since the end of last fiscal year. Plan Activity Verus collaborated with System staff on several projects during the fiscal year. Among t hese were the completion o f the asset -liability work begun in the previous year . This result ed in adjustments to the str ategic asset allocation of the Retirement Fund which are designed to preserve much of the Fund's expected return in the face of the challenging market conditions described above , while also preserving the Fund's high level of risk -efficiency. The first half of the fiscal year also saw substantial work on both the structure of the Portable Alpha program and a search for high quality additions to the existing manager line -up, with full consideration given to each candidate's pote ntial contribution to the overall risk level of the program. This resulted in the addition of one high conviction strategy and the termination of a lower conviction strateg y. Work in the second half of the fiscal year began with the completion of a fee study which found that the University's investment costs are generally in line with the peer benchmark when adjusted for the plan's asset allocation . During the same quarter , Verus was pleased to participate in the addition of Baillie Gifford's Positive C hange strategy to both the Retirement Fund and Endowment Pool. Positive Change is a 100% ESG strategy focused on investing in companies which manufacture products or deliver services targeted towards solving societal challenges in the realms of the environment and society at large. Miscellaneous work during the year included several benchmark improvements , and an annual assessment of the risk level of the General Pool, which was in progress at fiscal y ear-end. Also in progress was an analysis of the tracking error of the portfolio of global public equity managers to its benchmark, the purpose of which is to help minimize uncompensated risk. OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-26 September 2, 2021Market Environment \"Two steps forward, one step back \" may be the phrase which best describes the trajectory of the global economy over the fiscal year. The faster -than -expected distribution of highly effective vaccines within the developed world paved the way for gradual reopening of developed economies, but emerging economies with less access to quality vaccines were less prepared to deal with the litany of more -virulent mutations and had to respond with more draconian social distancing controls to mitigate increases in case growth. Risk-on sentiment propelled financial markets forward, backstopped by continued support from global central banks, the light at the end of the tunnel provided by vaccines, and the inclination of markets to shrug off big surprise s on earnings and economic data. Expectations for a strong rebound in economic growth and inflation over the intermediate -term sparked a rotation from the growth sectors that had performed well through the crisis toward more value -orientated sectors prospe ctively positioned to outperform in a period of rising interest rates. This reflation trade thrived from mid -August until mid -May but began to unravel late in the fiscal year as a result of concerns about the delta Covid -19 variant and a hawkish pivot from the Federal Reserve. Looking ahead, the major questions investors are grappling with center around the staying power of high levels of inflation, the timeframe over which the Federal Reserve may begin to taper asset purchases, the outlook for fiscal stimulus, and the capability of companies to sustain high enough levels of earnings growth to justify elevated valuations. U.S. Equity \"Up and to the right \" has been the story for U.S. equity prices over the fiscal year as investors largely looked through the shorter -term impact of pandemic -related shutdowns and bet that fiscal and monetary support would be able to build a bridge to a post -pandemic world. A t the beginning of the fiscal year , the S&P 500 Index remained - 8.4% beneath its previous high -water mark. By mid-August, the index had reached a fresh all -time high and would proceed to close at record high levels in 53 of the 218 remaining trading days in the fiscal year, delivering a 40.8% total return along the way. Both r ealized and implied volatility receded to levels more in line with longer -term historical averages. Corporate revenues began to recover during the year, and the higher operating leverage ratios which resulted from a litany of cost -saving initiatives implemented during the pandemic worked to supercharge earnings growth. Per FactSet, the estimated year -over -year earnings growth for the S&P 500 Index as of Q2 2021 is 64%. If that rate were to materialize, it would mark the highest year -over -year rate reported by the index since Q4 2009 (109%). Despite the massive increase in corporate earnings, increasing stock prices prevented a material re -rating of U.S. equity valu ations, which remain at stretched levels relative to recent history. By fiscal year- end, the forward 12 -month price -to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 Index remained near 21x - well above both the five -year (18x) and ten -year (16x) averages. It is worth noti ng, however, that OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-27 September 2, 2021forward earnings estimates 12 months ago proved far too pessimistic, as analysts underestimated the strength of profit growth. Regarding equity size and style, small- cap equities made back some lost ground (Russell 2000 Index +62.0%) relative to large -cap (Russell 1000 Index +43.1%) , and the value factor (Russell 1000 Value Index +43.7%) narrowly outperformed the growth factor (Russell 1000 Growth Index +42.5). Much of the outperformance of the value factor was driven by the reflation trade , which favored sectors more heavily -weighted in the value benchmarks, including financials, industrials, and materials. International Equity Global equities largely tracked U.S. equities over the fiscal year, and the MSCI ACWI Index returned 39.3% i n U.S. dollar terms, with weakness in the U.S. dollar providing a slight boost to returns experienced by unhedged U.S. investors. Emerging market equities delivered a total return of 40.9% in U.S. dollar terms, edging out U.S. equities (S&P 500 Index +40.8 %) and outpacing international developed equities (MSCI EAFE +32.4%). The superior performance of emerging market equities was driven by a rebound in the Latin American contingent broadly, and Brazil and Mexico specifically. In Mexico, stocks advanced 55.9 %, as the Mexican peso appreciated 15.4% relative to the dollar. The recovery in crude oil prices from around $41 to $75 per barrel undoubtedly played a huge role in the resurgence, but that recovery also coincided with a material pickup in inflation which led many central banks within the index to begin tightening the reins with regard to monetary policy. There exists some concern that given the general lack of access to quality vaccines in some emerging market countries, persistently high inflation rates could force monetary policymakers to prematurely tighten financial conditions. In emerging Asia, Taiwanese (+70.5%) and Korean (+66.2%) equites delivered impressive returns, but Chinese equities returned just 27.4%, materially lagging the global opportunity set. Chinese equities began to sell off in late February, with the initial catalyst being a decision from the People's Bank of China to shift its focus away from ensuring accommodative financial conditions and toward limiting the risks of excessive leverage in certain segments of the economy. Losses accelerated in the second quarter of calenda r year 2021 when regulators cracked -down on some national champions in the IT industry. While it appears that both general liquidity conditions have begun to improve and the tech crackdown has showed signs of easing, these issues remain front and center fo r the broader emerging market equity universe. In developed markets, Europ ean stocks returned just 26.6% in local terms, but the strong run of the euro relative to the dollar boosted performance for unhedged U.S. investors in European equities to 35.1%. In flation in Europe has picked up more slowly than in the U.S. or the emerging markets. This, combined with the Eurozone's relative inflexibility with regard to fiscal policy, likely supports the case that the European Central Bank will have the longest runway for continuing to provide monetary accommodation. OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-28 September 2, 2021Japanese equities underperformed in both local (+28.4%) and U.S. dollar (+24.8%) terms. The Japanese yen was one of the few currencies which depreciated relative to the dollar over the last year, due in part to the significant increase in U.S. Treasury yields above Japanese government bond yields, which officials at the Bank of Japan have committed to keeping within a relatively narrow range (within 25 basis points of 0.0%). Fixed Income The reflation narrative and debate over the persistence of higher inflation largely directed the global fixed income markets over the fiscal year. In the U.S., the 10 -year Treasury yield rose from 0.66% to a post -pandemic peak of 1.74% by the end of the fi rst quarter of calendar year 2021, before moderating to 1.47% by the end of the fiscal year. Breakeven inflation rates tracked Treasury yields in terms of direction - the ten -year breakeven inflation rate rose from 1.34% to an eight -year high of 2.56% in May before moderating slightly during the last few weeks of the fiscal year. In terms of performance, global treasuries returned 1.2% in U.S. dollar terms, with U.S. Treasuries underperforming ( -3.5%), and longer -duration Treasuries in the U.S. faring the w orst (-10.6%). Large increases in breakeven inflation rates helped to buffer Treasury inflation - protected securities from the impact of increasing interest rates, and the Bloomberg Barclays TIPS Index returned 6.5%. Credit spreads compressed to the lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis and default rates fell to below average levels, supporting outperformance of riskier credit. In the U.S., corporates within the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Index delivered a return of 3.3%, high -yield credit returne d 15.4% as spreads dipped from 6.26% to 2.68%, and bank loans advanced 11.7%. Hard-currency denominated emerging markets debt climbed 6.8%, while local- currency emerging market debt returned 6.6%. While emerging market debt spreads have remained at compressed levels, increases in benchmark interest rates pushed forward by central bankers within the complex sent total yields slightly higher, which weighed on performance. The anticipation of further hikes could put pressure on prices. Outlook Risk-on sentiment has driven global financial markets over the fiscal year, with equity benchmarks hitting fresh all -time highs, bond yields rising, credit spreads tightening to their lowest level in over a decade, and the dollar weakening. Investors appear to have priced in an eventual full recovery from the global pandemic, and the expectation for continued support over the intermediate term from developed market central banks appears to have emboldened market participants to continue to take risk. OPEN - FIN - INFO 1-29 September 2, 2021More recently, concerns have built around the spread of the delta variant and its potential to limit the pace of global economic growth moving forward, as well as eventual asset purchase tapering from the Fed which looks less likely to allow inflation to run unchecked. As a result, the reflation trade has slowed down and investors have rotated out of shorter- duration energy stocks toward longer- duration tech stocks, and into bets on a flatter yield curve. Corporate earnings have delivered to some extent on the promise implied by price action last year, but continued price increases this year have kept valuations at historically stretched levels. While it appears possible that risk assets could continue to rally into the next year, the road could well become bump ier from here, given the lack of value apparent across asset classes at present. We retain a cautiously optimistic view, but given the risks prefer a tight position relative to policy, given the uncertainty which continues to shroud the outlook. Conclusion We at Verus value our relationship with the University of Missouri and we appreciate the privilege of working with the Board and staff in designing policies and supporting decisions aimed at meeting the University's investment objectives. We remain confident in the direction of the p ortfolio s given the University's unique objectives, its fiscal strength, and its well- designed investment strategies. We look forward to continuing our partnership as we navigate ever -changing capital markets. Sincerely, Jeffre y J.

September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 1-3 University of Missouri - Columbia Research Investments Executive Summ ary Project Description The dividend funding will be invested in the Mizzou's research growth initiative. The overall goal of the initiative is to become a stronger research university with research performance that is nationally competitive amongst flagship institutions. Investments seek to impact research rankings through higher citations, national recognition of our faculty and improve MU's economic impact on the state through licensing and industry partnerships. As we recruit new faculty and assist current faculty to support research growth , it will be essential that we are able to provide the start up support necessary to foster research growth and provide the caliber of space and equipment necessary to conduct their research. MU seeks to invest the dividend as follows: $10M as startup packages for new research focused faculty to be recruited during the FY2022 cycle. $29M as a portion of the internal funding required to carry out the research focused items on our capital plan . Project Justification The investments in startup funding will allow the University to provide competitive packages to faculty who can further advance the precision health initiative and generate additional competitively awarded research for the University. This additional fund ing will allow the University to offer approximately 10 startup packages to faculty who fit the University's strategic areas of focus. The $29M investment in our research focused capital plan will ensure that we equip our current and future faculty with t he infrastructure it takes to successfully grow our research portfolio. Funding Strategy The $39M dividend will support investments already made, including the $225M NextGen Precision Health Center Building. Further funding plans will be developed for e ach faculty member as they are hired, with faculty salaries funded on research generated and additional tuition generated from teaching. The FY22 dividend will be stacked with future dividends and other sources of investment to continue making progress towards improving MU's research rankings over the coming years.

This project will provide spaces and opportunities for all students to cultivate ide as leading to research, innovation, and creative expression that promotes entrepreneurship. It will provide various sized collaboration spaces from large (1,500 gsf) open study areas to small (100 gsf) rooms that accommodate smaller groups. A generous lobby; lounge; multipurpose space; spaces for augmented reality, virtual reality, and maker areas; and four active learning classrooms will give first -year students a shared experience in the building. This project also includes the removal of obsolete space through the demolition of three facilities. This project is part of S&T's capital plan, and it is also funded through gifts. Project Justification This facility will improve recruitment and retention by providing first-year students a significantly imp roved experience for their required first -year courses through increased engagement with their peers and faculty in active learning classrooms, ideation labs, and a wide variety of collaborative spaces. The student experience center is planned to be locate d in the arrival district adjacent to the proposed welcome center and will be a key stop on the prospective student tour. This facility will be attractive to prospective students, and will be a critical component of S&T's recruitment strategy. S&T's 2018 Strategic Plan includes five Compacts. The first compact is the Compact for Excellence in Student Success. The first Objective under this compact - \"Increase the Quality of the Student Experience\" - is in direct alignment with the purpose of the Student Experience Center. The new Center will provide experiences and student services to maximize career success, will enhance student access to quality tools and resources needed for first-year curriculum, and will improve the quality of the first- year experience. This Student Experience Center will have a significant positive impact to student retention rates. The project will include the demolition of the Bureau of Mines Buildings 1, 2, and 3. This demolition will eliminate $10.5M in facilities need s and reduce 44,437 gsf of obsolete space. Funding Strategy The remainder of the project will be funded by gifts from the Kummer Institute and other donors.

The aims of this project are: a. Through renovation of current space, address physical infrastructure safety and academic concerns noted by NASM (National Association of Schools of Music) and NASD (National Association of Schools of Dance) in our most recent accreditation cycle. NASM is scheduled for a site visit in September 2021; NASD wi ll return for a site visit in 2023. Renovations include acoustic modifications in rehearsal spaces in order to bring noise levels down to National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health guidelines and improved practice facilities for students b. Through renovation of current space, relocate and rename the food pantry. It will move from its current location in a building north of campus to the Student Union and be rebranded the CARE Center. We aim to improve access for all students, increase capacity to provide food and basic necessities, and integrate the center as a destigmatized, basic student support program. c. Through renovation of current space in the Atterbury Student Success Center, expand and reconfigure Career Services so that it can serve more students, particularly as UMKC expands career and professional development programming through the Professional Mobility Escalator program. 2) Collectively, the impact of these projects is to improve student recruitment and retention across all academic progra ms. These renovations will positively impact campus culture and climate, demonstrating an investment in students' health, safety, and wellness, as well as their academic and career success. 3) UMKC identified $500K in gift revenue to match the renovations in Olson Performing Arts and Grant Hall. UMKC is seeking additional funding for Career Services personnel infrastructure and Professional Mobility Escalator infrastructure through multiple state and private sources, as well as reallocated operational funding for sustainability.

Project Justification To recruit and retain students, as well as high quality faculty and staff, we need a campus physical infrastructure that demonstrates our commitment to health, safety, and wellness, and importantly students career success. 1) These capital r enovation projects align with our strategic plan pillars focused on increasing our student body (recruitment and retention), as well as our commitment to diversity (economic/resource diversity of our student body). The improvements are in alignment with th e master plan. 2) The capital renovations are targeted at campus locations/priorities that are both public facing and high profile from a community perspective. Not only will they address the most pressing accreditation concerns this fall, but they will be key to student recruitment for fall 2022. For example, the ability to showcase and expanded and vibrant career services center at the same time UMKC launches the professional mobility escalator program will help not only attract new students, but donors. 3) Success measures include a positive re -accreditation without significant physical space concerns and growth in student use of the CARE Center and Career Services by 25%. 4) The risk of not addressing the Olson Performing Arts and Grant Hall spaces is a negative acc reditation review and negative student/family/community impact. The risk of not addressing the CARE Center and Career Services spaces is that UMKC will not have the capacity adequately serve students in areas that are most critical to their success outsid e of the classroom. Funding Strategy Funding for the $6.2M project will be $500K from gifts (already received) and $5,7M from the Strategic Dividend. This project will eliminate $2.1 million in facilities needs.

In accordance with the University of Missouri Collected Rules and Regulations 70.060, each campus is required to bring updated Campus Master Plans for approval to the Board of Curators every five years, or when significant changes are proposed. The Campus Master Plan builds upon previous Master Plans and supports Missouri S&T's Strategic Plan. Missouri S&T Mission Missouri S&T integrates education, research, and application to create and convey knowledge that serves our state and helps solve the world's great challenges. Missouri S&T Vision Missouri S&T will be the leading public technological research university for discovery, creativity, and innovation. We will cultivate curiosity, creativity, and confidence in our graduates. We will be the institution of choice for partners around the world seeking a highly qualified, talented, and entrepreneurial workforce; innovative research; relevant educational programs, products and services; and technology and ideas to solve the great challenges of our time. The Five Missouri Compacts The 2018 Strategic Plan identifies five \"Compacts\" that are foundational to the University's vision of institutional excellence. All five have implications to the physical campus and its facilities. The five compacts are: Excellence in Student Success Excellence in Research and Creative Works Excellence in Engagement and Outreach Inclusive Excellence Excellence in Planning, Operations and Stewardship Missouri S&T Master Plan Missouri S&T's Campus Master Plan seeks to build upon the previous 2014 Master plan and 2017 update, while also addressing the 2018 Strategic Plan and the Chancellor's bold plan of growing the school's student enrollment by 50%. The Chancellor's plan focuses on enrollment and retention; r esearch, innovation and entrepreneurial thinking; and regional economic development. The Campus Master Plan is intended to be a flexible, living document and a means of making visionary, yet practical and cost -effective decisions on physical changes to the September 2, 2021 OPEN - FIN - 2-2 campus. As such, the analysis and recommendations of the master plan serve as a framework for campus development in the short and longer term. Improvements to the overall campus experience as well as new and improved physical spaces will be instrumental in addressing the priority areas that make up the Chancellor's plan. The master plan process included an overall physical campus assessment, a space utilization analysis and a space needs assessment. This work was conducted through campus and building tours, focus groups, interviews with key stakeholders, an online survey to the entire campus community and many focused meetings with regards to the space analysis to ensure accuracy of the campus data. Through the process, four key themes emerged, becoming core planning principles which guided the development and priorities of the master plan : Improve Campus Experience for All The University should be a welcoming, inclusive campus that provides an exceptional experience for undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Improve Existing Space Maintaining and improving existing campus space is essential to provide equity in teaching and research spaces across campus facilities and to create environments that support instructional success. This also promotes financial, environmental, and operational sustainability . Improve Campus Connectivity and Safety Accessing and moving through campus should be a safe experience no matter where you are on campus. Key points of pedestrian and vehicular conflict must be addressed. A cohesive, branded site infrastructure should be leveraged to improve the aesthetics and safety of campus and edge conditions. Create Space for Strategic Partnerships Underutilized campus space should be repurposed to support formation of strategic partnerships that benefit Missouri S&T's strategic goals and, when feasible, provide economic benefit to campus through ground leases and/or other means.

The capital planning process and investment in existing facilities are two key components of Facilities Stewardship. Facilities stewardship is about taking a long and broad view of an institution's past and future. The University of Missouri System is comprised of over 1,500 buildings, four primary campuses and a health care system. Total valuation is over $11 billion. Due to continued limited funding, we must be deliberate in setting capital priorities to uphold our stewardship responsibility. The capital planning process is critical in ensuring we uphold that responsibility. Included herein is the FY 2022 Mid-Year Capital Project Plan Deviation for review and approval.

MURR is the most powerful in the country, and the MURR expansion will allow for growth in space for R&D industry partners and researchers, scientists, engineers, and students at MU. Of note, MURR recently executed an exclusive multi -year agreement (worth over $300M) with Advanced Accelerator Applications International, SA (AAA), a Novartis comp any, to provide a key ingredient in a targeted therapy for certain types of cancerous tumors. Budget: $20,000,000 A PPS has been completed for a $15M project Schedule: 24 - 30 months Radioisotope Facility at Discovery Ridge (Previously on the Aspirational Strategic Plan) The DOE Isotope Program (DOE IP) has collaborated with the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) for decades. More recently that collaboration has grown such that MURR was one of the first to join DOE IP's University Network. This new partnering approach allows for economical supply of R&D grade Se -75 and Lu- 177 by combining unique strengths. Building on the proven partnering abilities and taking a fresh look at core unique strengths of each organization leads to the concept of establishing a DOE Isotope Processing Center (DOE IPC) at the University of Missouri -Columbia. The proposed Center would leverage MURR's competency and experience in the weekly proces sing and supply of short -lived isotopes as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The partnership with DOE is under review, and if accepted, the total project funding will be by DOE. Details of the real estate agreement will be negotiated as the DOE co nsiders and evaluates the MU proposal. Budget: $19,976,000 A PPS has been completed Schedule: 24 - 30 months Medical Sciences Building - Renovations The Medical Sciences Building predominantly houses School of Medicine research faculty. The renovation will update research laboratories and infrastructure to accommodate new faculty hires through the School of Medicine (SOM) research excellence hiring initiative, which has created an d approved 30 new positions to date. The project scope is identified as renovating the laboratories which have not been improved in 20 years or more.

The total project budget of $30,000,000, will be funded by a $15,000,000 State Appropriation and $15,000,000 by gifts. The Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (VMDL) is Missouri's only veterinary laboratory accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostics and is a major resource to state and national networks to monitor and investigate potential outbreaks of animal diseases. Built in the 1970's, the 22,000 square f eet current VMDL facility supports biomedical and translational research and acts as a grounds for training veterinary students and residents. It houses a necroscopy, an incinerator, diagnostic laboratory sections, offices, and support spaces. These current aging facilities are insufficient to meet our institutional and regional needs and must be replaced to comply with accreditation standards and future research growth. The new facility will also be used in collaboration with the State of Missouri Agriculture Health Diagnostics Laboratory in Jefferson City to serve the producers in Missouri. This project will include space moves from the nearby Veterinary Sciences Building, which is planned for demolition as part of the campus wide strategic space reduction initiative. The new VMDL Building will consist of a 34,200 gross square feet (gsf) two- story structure plus mechanical penthouse constructed on the east side of the existing VMDL on the Veterinary Medicine complex of buildings in the southeast portion of campus. The building will replace critical functions in the current VMDL including necroscopy and diagnostic laboratories. The level of biosecurity will be increased through two separated receiving entries, an enhanced necroscopy, and a Biosafety Level Three laboratory. The quality of the diagnostic laboratories will be upgraded in the new facility with close proximity to bio- samples. Preliminary program concepts include a ground floor to include two receiving areas, incinerator, necroscopy, Level Three Biosafety laboratory, Bacteriology laboratories, and locker/shower/laundry facilities. The second floor includes laboratories for serology and molecular diagnostics. The exterior aesthetic is envisioned to embrace and compliment the adjacent Veterinary Medicine campus buildings. Funding for this project also includes costs to vacate and demolish the existing Veterinary Medicine Building and expand its adjacent parking lot. Clark & Enersen , Inc., Kansas City, Missouri, is the recommended architect for this project. Clark & Enersen presented a well -balanced team of experts with in -depth knowledge of Veterinary Medical Diagnostics Labor atories, and provided many examples of relevant project experience.

September 2, 2021August 26, 2021 OPEN - HEALTH AFF - 2-1August 26, 2021 Request to Certify Compliance with MU Health Compliance Obligations MU Health is proposing that the Health Affairs Committee of the Board of Curators adopt a resolution confirming that MU Health has implemented an effective compliance program under the Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA). Background Effective as of June 30, 2016, the University entered a five-year CIA with the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (OIG- HHS). The CIA was entered to resolve administrative claims of the OIG-HHS related to the federal investigation of radiology claims at MU Health. The CIA requires Board review and oversight of matters related to compliance with Federal health care program requirements and the obligations in the CIA. The Board must receive periodic reports on compliance matters, describe the materials it has reviewed as part of MU Health's annual report to the OIG, and adopt an annual resolution confirming that MU Health has an effective compliance program. Under the CIA, the obligations of the Board can be performed by the full Board or a designated committee of the Board. At its September 15, 2016, meeting, the Board designated the Health Affairs Committee to provide oversight as required by the CIA. The Health Affairs Committee previously adopted resolutions for the first, second, third, and fourth annual reporting periods. Reasons for the Recommendation The fifth annual reporting period for the CIA ended June 30, 2021. As part of its fifth year obligations, the Health Affairs Committee must adopt a resolution regarding its review and oversight of the MU Health compliance program. The resolution must be signed by each member of the Health Affairs Committee. The resolution and a summary of materials reviewed by the Health Affairs Committee must be included in the annual report to the OIG which is due October 1, 2021. The proposed resolution would confirm that the Health Affairs Committee has (1) inquired into the operations of MU Health's Compliance Program including the performance of the Chief Compliance Officer and the Executive Compliance Committee1 and (2) concluded, to the best of its knowledge, that MU Health has an effective compliance program that meets Federal health care program requirements and the obligations of the CIA. The resolution would further provide for the Secretary of the Board of Curators to prepare a form of the resolution that could be signed by each member of the Health Affairs Committee. 1 The current roster of members of the Executive Compliance Committee is attached hereto.

OPEN - ASARED - 1-1 September 2, 2021Executive Summary New Degree Program, Bachelor of Arts in Urban Journalism & Strategic Communications, UMKC The University of Missouri - Kansas City proposes a new B.A. in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communications designed to meet the needs of KC-area employers and provide a unique curriculum focused on urban communities. The degree will serve students from the Kansas City region - particularly underserved communities, who grew up and live here, who work here, who study here, and who will give back to local communities of color after graduation. For minority students who are tied to the metropolitan area, UMKC remains the only option to study journalism. Thus, \"urban\" in our program title means not only journalism about urban issues, but also journalism education designed for urban communities. The B.A. in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication builds on the existing emphasis area in Journalism and Mass Communication in the Communication Studies Department. Seven faculty members will offer 28 courses. Both students and employers have expressed the need for UMKC to offer a major credential in Journalism and Strategic Communication. The program will prepare graduates to serve Kansas City area communities as professional journalists, advertising and public relations specialists and digital communication experts. Kansas City's major media outlets (including print, television, radio and digital media) have long advocated for a journalism program. In an attached letter of support, the editor responsible for hiring at The Kansas City Star stated that students who major in journalism are those who employers seek first, \"I know from my 20 years of experience as a hiring manager that media companies look for students who are journalism majors. Often my first `filter' on applications is whether the person applying has a degree in journalism.\" - Kansas City Star letter of support, Appendix 1. With this new degree, students at UMKC will identify themselves with \"journalism\" and \"journalists.\" We hope this will inspire UMKC students to pursue online graduate education in journalism at the University of Missouri - Columbia. Currently, anecdotal evidence and Google Education & Job Search Data (Appendix 10) suggest our graduates continue their education in Communications programs at other competing regional schools, like the University of Central Missouri and the University of Kansas. UMKC and the Missouri School of Journalism have had productive discussions about forming an alliance in the KC metro market in the future. UMKC can open doors for the Missouri School of Journalism, leveraging UMKC's years of local experience and connections. Johnson County Community College and UMKC's Department of Communication Studies entered into an articulation agreement in 2015 (See Appendix 3). Since then, there is a clear trend of increasing transfer students, especially from JCCC, MCC and K-State. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, student enrollment in the Journalism and Mass Communication emphasis area at UMKC had more than doubled during the past decade, standing at 100. However, the challenges that COVID has posed to higher education suggests our future success will rely on cross-campus collaboration within the UM system, higher efficiency of operation and faster market expansion. We anticipate this program will bring in 60-plus new students to UMKC in its first five years and generate new revenue beginning in Year 1 - FY23.

We anticipate this program will bring in 60-plus new students to UMKC in its first five years and generate new revenue beginning in Year 1 - FY23. 1. Introduction The proposed B.A. in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication is designed to prepare undergraduate students for professional careers in the next era of participatory, community and interactive journalism with a focus on the issues facing local urban communities. This degree will provide students the tools they need to examine and apply best practices in all fields of journalism. This includes solid writing, reporting, editing, production and performance skills across all media platforms. Student reporters will cover regional bi-state communities and will broaden their understanding of the mechanics of local government and the impact on neighborhoods, gain proficiency in intercultural communication and further develop their skills in cultural competency. Student journalists who deeply understand the challenges of a particular community will gain more empathy for all communities. Competency, understanding and empathy will be achieved in three ways: Student journalists will spend one semester of immersive study in an assigned neighborhood. They will produce reports or segments for both traditional and digital media. Students will intern for a semester at a non-profit or local government agency specializing in community affairs and assistance. This will give students further exposure to challenges Kansas City's bi-state communities face. As part of their capstone journalism experience, students will produce professional reports for media outlets managed by the Department of Communication Studies like KHEN-17 (Community Access Television {CAT} that transmits to 500,000 households), K-Roo Student Radio, and the UMKC- supported University News. A student news agency, Wyandotte County News Bu reau, will be developed to provide news and information targeting au diences in Kansas City bi-state communities. This agency is ready to start operating in Spring 2022. Student journalists will also have the opportunity to use UMKC resources and work with the UMKC Center for Neighborhoods, Center for Midwestern Studies, UMKC IDEAS and the NexGen Precision Health Initiative. We seek a journalism degree program primarily because students and professional media outlets in the Kansas City metro area have consistently asked for it. About 70% of students in the College OPEN - ASARED - 1-7 September 2, 2021of Arts & Sciences at UMKC are designated as \"in need students,\" i.e., Pell Grant recipients. For the majority of these students who are tied to the metropolitan area, UMKC remains the only option to study journalism. Students will complete all general education courses within UMKC's College of Arts and Sciences (to be renamed as the School of Art, Culture, and Social Studies in Fall 2022) and 39 credit hours in the major. Upper-level courses will be 30 credit hours of the total. Three UMKC faculty members \u2014Ye Wang, Steve Kraske and Peter Morello \u2014will oversee the Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication program and work with staff members. Among the regular professional and scholarly contributions these faculty members make are \"Up To Date,\" the daily public affairs program on KCUR, Kansas City's NPR affiliate (Kraske); Fulbright Scholar and Senior Specialist, who oversees UMKC's Fulbright applications and has had multiple international appointments as a Fulbright scholar (Morello); and 20 plus peer-reviewed journal articles and national grants (NSF IUSE #19350761, by Wang). Other distinguished adjunct or contract faculty members currently teach in the Department of Communication Studies. They include: Peggy Lowe, a KCUR investigative reporter; Jeffri Chadiha, a senior writer for NFL.com and a co-host of \"Gameday First\"; Jaysen Van Sickle, executive director at Hope Faith, Kansas City; Traci Angel, an investigative reporter; and others. The proposed new degree will require four additional adjunct instructor positions. With the increase in enrollment, we will need to hire adjuncts to teach required courses, for example, COMMST 270, COMMST 203, COMMST 446, COMMST 478 and COMMST 387, depending on needs. We will also use these adjunct hires to invite prominent local journalists and communication professionals to share their knowledge with our students in special topic courses. 2. University Mission & Program Analysis 2.A. Alignment with University Mission & Goals The proposed B.A. degree in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication aligns with UMKC's mission with its emphasis on learning, diversity and inclusion as well as urban-serving missions: \"As an urban research university, our mission at the University of Missouri-Kansas City is to promote learning through the discovery, preservation and dissemination of knowledge of public value across a broad spectrum of disciplines and fields of study. UMKC celebrates the individual and embodies diversity and inclusion by intertwining 1 CUE Ethics: Collaborative Research: Open Collaborative Experiential Learning (OCEL.AI): Bridging Digital Divides in Unde rgraduate Education of Data Science (01/01/2020 - 6/30/2021, $ 350,000). OPEN - ASARED - 1-8 September 2, 2021these goals with innovation to enable transformational impact aimed at bringing cultural, social, health and economic prosperity to the metropolitan, regional and global communities we serve.\"2 A degree in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication will meet the goal of UMKC and the College of Arts and Sciences by preparing students to work competently in their chosen fields (corporate, governmental, nonprofit or academic) that demand either specialized or versatile degrees. The proposed B.A. offers a major that is desirable for employers based on periodic needs assessments conducted by the Communication Studies Department and supervisor exit interviews following student internships (COMMST 484 Internship). The proposed B.A. will advance urban engagement by providing education and experience in a diverse metropolitan community. The proposed B.A. will uphold the principles of diversity by including courses that address urban issues, policies, cross-cultural journalism, and multicultural strategic communication. The proposed B.A. will promote research development by teaching students investigative reporting, strategic communication research, data literacy and data science. With a B.A. degree in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication, students will gain experience working and reporting in diverse metropolitan communities, enabling them to develop a context for the rich intellectual and social life of the communities. The new Urban Journalism & Strategic Communication degree program aligns with the strategic goals of the University of Missouri System, specifically with the new goals and strategies formulated by the Missouri School of Journalism in January 2017. In particular, we align with the goals of increasing learning experience, accessibility education and inclusion, such as: Promote excellence and inclusion through teaching and student academic experiences, in and out of the classroom (MU goal). Increase student thriving, engagement and sense of belonging through accessibility support, community and mentorship (MU goal). Foster innovation and high-impact research to advance the professions of journalism and strategic communication (MU J-School's goal). The goals of the Urban Journalism & Strategic Communication program at UMKC are: To prepare UMKC graduates for evolving professions across all media. To advance innovation and research critical to the future of journalism and strategic communication. To engage communities in Kansas City and the bi-state area, and to collaborate with external partners to effectively serve diverse audiences. To foster collaboration with the University of Missouri-Columbia, UMSL and Missouri S&T. 2 https://www.umkc.edu/about/mission.html OPEN - ASARED - 1-9 September 2, 2021We will continue to align the Urban Journalism & Strategic Communication degree program with new goals as they are developed. We also seek course-sharing initiatives with divisions and departments at UMKC, the Missouri School of Journalism, UMSL and Missouri S & T. We can offer the following courses: Established Courses (Courses currently taught online as synchronous (OS) asynchronous (AS,) or blended (B) are marked in upper cases.)

Duplication & Collaboration within Campus, Across System This program focuses on journalism as both an urban craft and as a service to the local underserved communities. The focus on communities in the Kansas City bi-state region of the major sets the proposed degree apart from journalism programs elsewhere in Missouri and Kansas by attracting students who have strong ties to OPEN - ASARED - 1-10 September 2, 2021Kansas City. It also fulfills the needs of transfer students with Associate's degrees from Johnson County and Metropolitan Community Colleges. Most students who choose to remain in the Kansas City area do so because of financial reasons, Kansas City's growing job market or family commitments. We want them to be inspired by \"being a journalism student,\" and eventually pursue a graduate degree of journalism offered by the Missouri School of Journalism. As mentioned in the Executive Summary, the new degree, due to this service mission and UMKC's diverse student body, will not duplicate programs that MU, UMSL or Missouri S&T offer. Our program is unique because the degree will serve students from underrepresented minority communities in the Kansas City region who grew up and live here, who work here, who study here, and who will give back to local communities of color after graduation. More than 40% of students in Journalism and Mass Communication Emphasis are minorities (see Appendix 14). About 70% of students in the College of Arts & Sciences at UMKC are designated as \"in need students,\" i.e., Pell Grant recipients (based upon 2020 UMKC enrollment data). For minority students who are tied to the metropolitan area, UMKC remains the only option to study journalism. Thus, \"urban\" in our program title means not only journalism about urban issues, but also journalism education designed for urban communities. Students of the proposed degree will be trained to give a voice to local minority communities, for example, those living in the news desert of Wyandotte County, Kansas. This makes the program an authentic urban journalism experience. Meanwhile, UMKC and the Missouri School of Journalism have had productive discussions about forming an alliance in the KC metro market. Both sides have reviewed a detailed and clear plan of course-sharing, which will likely start in Spring 2022. Shared interest areas are identified by both sides: data journalism, strategic communication, media history and media law. With calls from granting agencies like the National Science Foundation, data journalism, in particular, occupies a strategic position in the national mission of broadening participation in data science education at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels. We have reached out to several faculty members at Mizzou, including Mike Jenner, faculty group chair of journalism practice; Yong Volz, faculty group chair of journalism studies; Jon Stemmle, faculty group chair of strategic communication; and David Herzog, well-known investigative journalist and professor. We met and talked on Zoom and over the phone multiple times to discuss a plan to start online course sharing in Spring 2022. We closely examined and discussed Mizzou's current course offerings to explore opportunities of collaboration. Under the Big Idea of the campus- site program (see Figure 2), we are currently working on these course-sharing proposals (see Appendices 5, 6, 7, & 8): 1. JOURN 4430 Data Journalism 2. JOURN 2200 Audiences and Persuasion 3. JOURN 4952 Strategic Communication Research I 4. JOURN 4204 Introduction to Strategic Writing and Design OPEN - ASARED - 1-11 September 2, 2021In the future, we will plan to share more online courses in areas of Data Journalism, Advertising, Public Relations, Media History and Media Law. We are aiming at establishing a long-term mutually beneficial relationship with the Missouri School of Journalism, by combining the strengths of the two programs. First, Mizzou's J-school is well-known and well-established with the highest standards. It has capacity to offer advanced courses in emerging areas. It can provide advice to UMKC for future program accreditation. Second, UMKC's Journalism and Strategic Communication program can help spread the influence of Mizzou's J-school to urban minority communities that are difficult to reach via traditional channels. UMKC has 40% to 50% minority students, and instructors are experienced in interacting and teaching a diverse student body. With strong roots in local urban communities, our program works with local community leaders and organizations to bring unique, real-world experience to our students. UMKC can bring journalism education to minority and underrepresented communities. UMKC's deep connections with local communities are an addition to the entire MU brand name. The proposed journalism program can inspire more minority students to pursue a journalism and strategic communication education at UMKC or Mizzou. Third, the collaboration can create a more efficient budget model via course sharing, especially in the area of emerging areas, like data journalism. To facilitate the collaboration, UMKC is developing and revising courses to introduce data science education in journalism and strategic communication. Both COMMST 324 Data Journalism and COMST 447 Interactive and Social Media Advertising are part of an NSF-funded project ($350,000) to experiment with a story-driven approach to teaching data science in CS+Journalism/Strategic Communication courses. To strengthen our effort, we also started forming a Wyandotte County news bureau, which can potentially become an urban data collection operation to empower investigative journalism in a KC-area news desert. OPEN - ASARED - 1-12 September 2, 2021 Figure 1. SWOT Analysis for the Collaboration We are hoping, in the future, the Missouri School of Journalism can become the leader of the collaboration that strengthens the presence of the Missouri Method in urban minority communities in Kansas City. Figure 2. A Mizzou-led Future Collaboration: Campus-Site Program OPEN - ASARED - 1-13 September 2, 20213. Business-Related Criteria & Justification 3.A. Market Analysis 3.A.1. Rationale & Workforce Demand for the Program There is a great need for journalism graduates in the region (including Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Tennessee). According to Burning Glass Program Insight, 2,514 journalism degrees (533 from MU) were conferred in 2019 compared with 16,488 jobs in the region. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in media and communication is projected to grow 4 percent from 2014-2024, which will result in about 27,400 new jobs. The Burning Glass data also shows that the concentration of journalism and broadcasting jobs in the region is close to the national level (Location Quotient = 0.9). In Kansas City, the labor-market growth for journalism-related occupations is projected to be 17.08%, which is significantly higher than 10.03%'s regional growth rate. The national growth rate projection is only 3.59%. In short, there is reason to believe that there is an unmet need for journalism-trained graduates in the region in general and in Kansas City in particular. UMKC can help address this. The journalism program maps to 13 occupations across 5 occupation groups.3 In Missouri, the projected salary for journalism graduates is $50,000, higher than the living wage salary ($30,000) in this region. The median annual wage for media and communication occupations was $53,530 in May 2015, which was higher than the median annual wage of $36,200 for all occupations. All of the support letters from The Kansas City Star, KCUR, KCPT, and 41 Action News strongly recommend such a degree program. In particular, the focus on urban issues is much needed to draw public attention to urban cores. The approach of urban journalism will be a \"huge service to our communities for generations to come,\" according to The Kansas City Star. KCUR has also applauded the direction of urban journalism studies at UMKC, stating \"reporters provide the truest understanding for an audience hungry for credible voices and analysis.\" Given the central location of UMKC in the KC metro area, \"there is real urgency for UMKC to create this Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication program.\" 3 Writer, Video Editor, Proofreader, Copywriter, Technical Writer, Editor, Radio / Television Announcer, DJ / Announcer, Media Planner / Buyer, Reporter, Producer, Social Media Strategist / Specialist, Communications / Public Relations Manag er OPEN - ASARED - 1-14 September 2, 2021 The student survey of journalism and strategic communication courses (conducted in journalism and strategic communication courses with a response rate of 50% and using a 7-point scale, 1 being not at all interested and 7 being definitely interested) also reflects student demand for this degree. Students also wrote support letters for the degree proposal (please see Appendix 12). Appendix 13 includes a list of UMKC journalism and strategic communication students who recently won top awards in 2021's Missouri College Media Association (MCMA). Sample Size = 20 Mean Standard Deviation Would you be interested in a major in Journalism & Strategic Communication at UMKC? 1=Not at all interested 2 3 4 5 6 7=Definitely interested 6.10 1.119 Would you combine a major in Journalism & Strategic Communication at UMKC with another area of study? 1=Not at all interested 2 3 4 5 6 7=Definitely interested 5.90 1.119 See Appendix 2 for the sample size and survey data. 3.A.2. Student Demand for the Program The number of students seeking a Communication Studies degree with an emphasis in journalism and mass communication ranged from 110 to 135 per year before COVID. With increasing student interest in a \"major\" in journalism and strategic communication, we anticipate higher enrollments after the pandemic in broadcast, print, digital and social media, advertising and public relations. A major in urban journalism and strategic communication will attract students from area community colleges who wish to earn a four-year degree (after completion of associate's degrees in journalism or related fields). According to academic advisers, the journalism emphasis is getting about 25 transfer students each year. OPEN - ASARED - 1-15 September 2, 2021The proposed program would also offer students who prefer to remain in metro Kansas City (i.e., under-served, working and returning students) the opportunity to earn a comprehensive Journalism and Strategic Communication B.A. degree at UMKC. (See Appendix 3 for Articulation Agreement with Johnson County Community College for transfer students.) Considering current data for the emphasis, we project at least eight to 14 students will graduate with a degree in Urban Journalism & Strategic Communication within five years. The projections in Table 1a, Table 1b, and Table 1c, are based on CAS data of the past three years and the student survey: In 2013, 2014, and 2015, the Journalism and Mass Communication emphasis had 116 graduates in total. The graduates per academic level ranged from 35 to 43. In 2017, the emphasis graduated 60 students. Comparing 2019 and 2016 data, the enrollment figures have been steady (around 110 per semester, peaking at 127) until COVID. The emphasis has 85 students, according to Spring 2021 data, and 32 new admits in Fall 2021. This is a clear sign of the emphasis' resilience. With the declining capacity of community colleges due to the pandemic, we also expect to see a jump in demand in the KC market among students who before COVID would choose community colleges. Figure 3. Journalism and Mass Communication Emphasis Enrollment Data. (The data do not include double major, minor, or Communication Studies General.) OPEN - ASARED - 1-16 September 2, 2021In the following calculation, we used data from 2016 to 2019 due to the irregularity of 2020 and 2021. Based upon previous years, the annual average enrollment per academic level was 44 . In the student survey, when asked if one would be interested in a major in Journalism and Strategic Communication on a 7-point scale (1--not at all interested and 7--definitely interested), 17 of 20 (85%) students answered 5 or above. 15 out of 20 (75%) answered 6 or above. 10 out of 20 (50%) answered 7 (definitely interested). We made our enrollment projections based on this data. With approval of a degree program, an increase in enrollment is projected. For the fourth and the fifth years, it is realistic to project at least a 10% increase in enrollment. This projection is based on the highest enrollment number on record (N = 43): Table 1a shows enrolled new students each year. The number of part-time students (5%) is calculated on the reported proportion of part-time and freshman students in the survey. Table 1a Student Enrollment Projections (anticipated number of students enrolled during the fall semester of given year who were new to campus). Retention rate is the percentage of a school's first-time, first-year undergraduate students who continue at that school the next year. The national average retention rate is 73% according to collegefactual.com. Based on records compiled by academic advisers, retention in the journalism emphasis area is consistently higher than the national average. Therefore, we project a 71.2% first-year retention rate and calculate that 74.9% of students enrolled in the previous year will re-enroll the following year. Using these numbers, Table 1a shows projected enrollments.

Graduation rate is the percentage of a school's first-time, first-year undergraduate students who complete their program within 150% of the published time in a particular program. Therefore, we project 51.8% of students who are enrolled in the program as freshman will graduate in four years, and the same number of transfer students will graduate in two years. Table 1c shows the estimated degrees awarded. Although the estimates for graduation are based on current campus graduation rates, the program aims to increase its graduation rates, particularly through the partnership with Mizzou to feed more students into its MA programs. 3.B. Financial Projections See attached letter of financial support from Associate Dean Elizabeth Vonnahme. 3.B.1. Additional Resources Needed Costs listed here will be included as part of the annual budgeting process for the College of Arts and Sciences. The B.A. in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication expands on the current emphasis and will better position students to more effectively pursue careers in journalism/strategic communication. It will draw additional students from the area's large community colleges interested in a full four-year degree. While current journalism faculty will be largely involved in teaching courses for the program, four adjunct instructors will be needed. These professional faculty will teach required courses, for example, COMMST 270, COMMST 203, COMMST 478 and COMMST 387, depending upon needs. We will also use these adjunct hires to invite prominent local journalists and communication professionals to share their knowledge with our students in special topic courses. In addition, the department will offer more synchronous, asynchronous and blended online course work to accommodate students wishing to take more classes online. Faculty Salaries: We have budgeted for additional adjunct instructors in the second - fifth years, then one tenure-track hire in Year 6, contingent on meeting enrollment projections. An enrollment of 60 students will be necessary to make a full-time faculty hire. These hires will only be made if these enrollments are reached. This hire would focus on Data Journalism. Supplies: Average supply costs for copies and other miscellaneous. OPEN - ASARED - 1-18 September 2, 2021Marketing Costs: We've included $2,500 for initial marketing efforts and $800 per year after that. This number will address our marketing to our partner schools and developing materials for our recruiters. We will initially be focused on online/video marketing material aimed at both first-time college students and those who have completed their AA at local community colleges. In subsequent years we will work with our student Advertising Agency to create a print campaign with advice from our recruiters and feedback from student surveys of majors. Misc. Expenses: This is the budget for additional repair and support of equipment and computers. Course Development: All of the course development has been completed and the courses have been approved at the campus level. Start-up: There is a hire in the Pro Forma in Year 6 and $15,000 of startup costs have been budgeted for faculty research activities. 3.B.2. Revenue Revenue has been calculated based upon the number of full-time students who are new to campus (see Table 1a.) and students who are currently pursuing an Emphasis in Journalism and Mass Communication. Taking a conservative approach, several attributes are excluded from the revenue projections, including part-time students, summer enrollment and lab fees, which if included would result in additional revenues. These revenue figures presented in Form FP, Table 2, are based on full-time undergraduate students enrolled in 30 credit hours of coursework per year. The starting tuition rate is 288.19 per credit hour in FY 2023 with an annual increase of 2%. 3.B.3. Net Revenue Revenue will exceed expenses in year one of the program.

Academic and Financial Viability The proposed program has sufficient talent, resources and student enrollment for a vibrant, active learning environment. The program revenue will exceed the costs in Year 1, FY23. Thus, we consider the minimum enrollment needed for the program to be financially and academically viable is the enrollment number of Year 1. Using Year 1 as a scenario for Table 3., we become financially and academically viable with 24 OPEN - ASARED - 1-20 September 2, 2021students enrolled, which brings in $270,492 tuition and fees and generates a net revenue of $91,146.

Business Plan: Marketing, Student Success, Transition & Exit Strategies 3.C.1. Marketing Plan The objective of the marketing plan is to recruit transfer students and freshmen in the first year; raise awareness of an Urban Journalism & Strategic Communication degree and its value to metro area communities; attain a 15% increase of enrollment within five years; and maintain a retention rate of 75%. We will focus recruiting efforts on area high school graduating seniors and transfer students from community colleges, like Johnson Community College (JCCC) and Metropolitan Community College (MCC) and Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC). The number of credit students attending those three community colleges exceeds 45,000. An estimated 1,000 (or more) students are taking journalism, advertising and public relations for credit at just these area three community colleges. To raise awareness among high school students and their families, journalism faculty will create intuitive and interactive websites detailing program opportunities. Initially, these webpages will be hosted on the Department of Communication Studies website. College of Arts & Science recruiters, assisted by program faculty, will distribute brochures and posters to counselors in public high school districts throughout the 15-county Kansas City metropolitan area. Program faculty, when appropriate, will support college recruiters at high schools, community colleges and college fairs. Program faculty will also assist recruiters by providing print materials, online resources and specific talking points. An articulation agreement between the Department of Journalism at JCCC (Appendix 3) and the Department of Communication Studies has been implemented. The JCCC journalism department chair has stated a four-year journalism degree at UMKC will attract students who have earned their associate's degree at JCCC and wish to pursue studies in journalism and strategic communication. Program faculty will also broaden their partnerships with area community colleges like Metropolitan Community College and Kansas City Kansas Community College. The Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication degree program aligns with UMKC's institutional goals and motto, \"UMKC Roos everywhere,\" as Kansas City's premier urban learning community. Promotional spots will be placed on KHEN-17, a Spectrum cable channel that the Department of Communication Studies operates. KHEN-17 can be viewed by 500,000 households in the Kansas City area. Spots would also be placed on KCUR-FM (an NPR affiliate) and UMKC student media, (K-ROO Internet radio and U-News, UMKC's student newspaper). OPEN - ASARED - 1-22 September 2, 2021Internships, career advising, and application assistance for graduate/professional schools, awards programs (i.e., Truman, Fulbright, Scripps, Hearst, etc.) are integrated in the degree program. Instructors and program advisers will closely monitor student progress in all courses and at each program level, thus creating a nurturing learning environment for all students. The budget for recruitment and retention is revenue neutral. The College of Arts and Sciences is developing new webpages to be hosted by the Department of Communication Studies at no cost. Promotional spots placed on KHEN-17, KCUR and student media would not incur any cost. Printing fees for promotional materials will be covered by existing college and department recruitment budgets. 3.C.2. Student Success Plan The program will plan to support and retain students through graduation by proven methods - clear advising, faculty mentorship and offering hands-on engagements in and outside of the classroom. The department offers scholarships and has active student organizations. Opportunities like the Wyandotte new bureau, U News, The Student Advertising Agency and internship opportunities are high-impact engagements proven to lead to student success. 3.C.3. Transition Plan There is no single individual who is primarily responsible for the program. The chair of Communication Studies will ensure the success of the program, and if the person in that roles shifts, the program will remain part of the job's responsibilities. 3.C.4. Exit Strategy If the Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication major is significantly under- enrolled or not attracting students as predicted after two years, faculty will do research with current and former students to address inadequacies. If the program doesn't have an average graduation of 10 students a year after the fifth year, the program would be placed on inactive status. 4. Institutional Capacity The B.A. in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication is the \"repurposing\" of the current Journalism and Mass Communication emphasis area within Communication Studies. All degree courses will be taught by existing tenured/non-tenured faculty, adjuncts, select visiting professors and practicing professionals. OPEN - ASARED - 1-23 September 2, 20215. Program Characteristics 5.A. Program Outcomes Metro Kansas City, considered a major national media market, would serve as a diverse urban and regional laboratory for students considering careers in urban journalism and strategic communication. Graduates should be able to: Outcome 1: Describe theories, concepts, and ethical principles in urban journalism and strategic communication. Outcome 2: Apply skills to produce content for both traditional and digital media to meet professional standards. Outcome 3: Analyze urban influences on communities in and outside urban areas. Outcome 4: Write effective content for news reporting and advertising across all media platforms. Outcome 5: Examine cultural diversity and its significance in U.S. and global societies. Outcome 6: Evaluate research methods that are applicable to the profession. Specific ACEJMC (The Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication) values and principles that the student learning objectives correspond to are listed in Section 5.H. 5.B. Program Design & Content UMKC students, through applied methodologies and the examination of best practices in journalism, would study both traditional and multimedia journalism for the new millennium in a diverse urban environment. The design and content of the program is to educate the next generation of students to: Write and distribute comprehensive news content about urban issues, on deadline, for both traditional and new media outlets, including online news portals and social media. Broadcast and digital reports would be transmitted on KHEN-17 reaching 500,000 households in metro Kansas City, K-ROO student internet radio and other digital news sites, such as KCPT's Hale Center for Journalism. Print reports would be published in U-News, online news sites and select metro newspapers. OPEN - ASARED - 1-24 September 2, 2021 Examine the work of responsible and ethical purveyors of news or strategic communication in the best traditions of the journalistic craft. Produce (shoot/record/edit and write) video and audio news stories, documentaries and promotional work that engage and inform urban audiences. Incorporate developing digital platforms to enhance the experience of the viewer/listener/reader. Analyze news, urban audiences and what constitutes a news, feature or investigative story about urban issues. Thrive in contemporary Kansas City and Midwestern newsrooms and strategic communication outlets with an emphasis on digital content skills now essential to success. Strive for excellence and stay ahead of the curve in improving the quality of information the public often receives. This includes a deep understanding of context, complexity, inclusiveness, authenticity, and proportionality. These values apply to all media forms in journalism and strategic communication. 5.C. Program Structure 5.C.1. Program Structure Form 1. Total Credits Required for Graduation: 120 Residence requirements, if any: The final 30 consecutive credit hours of coursework must be taken face-to-face or online at UMKC.

Students are also required to take a 3- credit hours Journalism Practicum, and COMMST 432 Press, Politics & Public Policy: Urban Issues. Internship experiences are central to the Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication Program. The internship provides students with on-the-job experience, which is both practical and purposeful. The student will apply skills and concepts learned in the classroom. They will acquire new competencies and understanding under the guidance of a supervisor or mentor in the sponsoring agency. The internship experience will develop student appreciation of professional quality, commitment and cooperation in work relationships and best organizational practices. Students will have opportunities to learn teamwork and practice communication competencies. An essential aspect of the student's internship experience will be the opportunity to understand the WHY as well as the HOW of work performed within a specialized professional organization. OPEN - ASARED - 1-26 September 2, 2021 The internship will be part of an overall academic process based on individual learning goals and integrated professional experience that helps to link theory and practice 5. Any unique features such as interdepartmental cooperation: The proposed B.A. in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication is collaborating with the Studio Art Department to offer client-based courses in advertising and public relations. The proposed degree program will focus on communication, research, and data analytics skills that are essential to advertising copywriting and planning. Students from the proposed program will combine their advertising copywriting and planning specialties with the design and production skills of students from the Art and Art History department. Together, both programs work to create advertising campaigns promoting regional businesses and nonprofit organizations. Through this partnership, students are immersed in key strategies: branding, re-branding, conceptualization, campaign execution, client relations and audience targeting. With a recently funded NSF grant, the Department also starts a collaboration with the Computer Science Department to incorporate data science education in COMMST 447 Interactive and Social Media Advertising and COMMST 324 Data Journalism. These initiatives will serve as a blueprint for potential collaborative projects between students who major in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication and those who seek degrees in political science, environmental studies, sociology, health sciences, urban studies and education. 5.D. Program Goals and Assessment Initial assessments of Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication will be done in COMM ST 203, COMM ST 270, and COMM ST 308. All these are required introductory courses for journalism students. Further assessments will be done in COMM ST 387, COMM ST 432, and COMM ST 453, four required upper-division classes. Assessing student learning outcomes in both introductory and upper-division classes will allow for the examination of student progression by comparing the lower (203, 270, & 308) and upper (387, 432 & 453) results. The assessment measures will use student portfolios, a collection of various materials compiled in assessed classes. This includes research proposals, critical thinking essays on complex public policy, and societal, cultural and ethical issues, multimedia segments and conceptual papers describing theories and concepts. Students will meet or exceed expectations set for all students in assessments of General Education learning outcomes. Our goal for retention is 75% of matriculating students. The student survey conducted for the proposal found that 75% of the students have strong interest in the Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication program (see Appendix 2). It follows that students who have a strong interest are highly motivated OPEN - ASARED - 1-27 September 2, 2021to pursue the program. Therefore, we believe that 75% is a sound estimate of retention and graduation. Compared to the national average retention rate of 73%, 75% is a reasonable and achievable goal. Kansas City is a major U.S. media market (33 in 210 television markets--2017 Nielsen DMA Rankings, and 34 in 274 radio markets, Nielsen Audio Ratings). If students with degrees in Journalism and Strategic Communication choose to remain in the Kansas City region, they will have the needed skills for many positions offered by nine television stations, more than 50 radio stations and digital media outlets. In addition, Kansas City is home to nationally renowned print media, such as The Kansas City Star and the Kansas City Business Journal. Bernstein and Rein and VML are international advertising agencies headquartered in Kansas City. Numerous local agencies like Fasone and Partners have thrived in Kansas City for decades. Large corporations -- Cerner, Bayer, Unilever, T-Mobile (formerly Sprint), H&R Block and Cargill -- seek employees with solid strategic communication skills. The strength of the Kansas City region's media market will ensure high placement rates of our graduates. 5.E. Student Preparation Any student meeting the admissions requirements for UMKC and the College of Arts and Sciences will be eligible for the Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication major. No special preparation is required. A major in urban journalism and strategic communication will attract students from area community colleges who wish to earn a four-year degree (after completion of associate's degrees in journalism or related fields.) It would also offer students who prefer to remain in metro Kansas City (i.e., underserved, working and returning students) the opportunity to earn a comprehensive journalism and strategic communication B.A. degree at UMKC.

He co-hosts \"Gameday First,\" produces features for the network, and writes columns and stories for NFL.com. Faculty teaching in the department of Communication Studies must meet qualifications appropriate to their area of specialization, either by holding the appropriate earned degrees or the equivalent professional experience. Tenure-track faculty must hold a terminal degree in their field of study and meet departmental and college requirements and qualifications. Approximately 80% of the credit hours in the degree will be taught by full-time faculty. The department is in the process of hiring a replacement for a retiring faculty member. Tenure-track faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences are required to maintain high teaching standards, be active in their areas of research and scholarship, and serve their department, their university, their communities and their profession. Faculty members will participate in program recruiting and marketing efforts\u2014 locally, regionally and nationally. They will coordinate activities with the university and college admissions and marketing staff, and they will network with their respective professional and community organizations. 5.G. Alumni and Employer Survey We will survey our students the semester before they graduate about their experiences and level of satisfaction with the degree. We also plan to interview and survey alumni at points after graduation. In our sample, we will include alumni who work in Kansas City, alumni who work in other cities, and alumni who attend or attended graduate school in the field. The Journalism and Mass Communication emphasis already receives, on an informal basis, evaluative information regarding our graduates from area employers. Our faculty members have collegial relationships with local, regional, and national professionals in journalism and strategic communication, and often seek and receive feedback on our graduates who work for them. When we institute the B.A. in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication, we will formalize these channels by developing a survey for employers. 5.H. Program Accreditation The Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications, or ACEJMC, is the agency responsible for the evaluation of professional journalism and strategic communication programs. The Urban Journalism & Strategic Communication Program will seek full accreditation with advice from the Missouri School of Journalism five years after approval of the proposed major. The program is aligned with the mission of the Accrediting Council as stated in ACEJMC policy guidelines. OPEN - ASARED - 1-30 September 2, 2021 The Accrediting Council does not define specific curricula, courses or methods of instruction. It recognizes that each institution has its unique situation, cultural, social or religious context, mission and resources, and this uniqueness is an asset to be safeguarded. The Council judges programs against the objectives that units and institutions set for themselves and against the standards that the Council sets forth for preparing students for professional careers in journalism and mass communications in the United States and in other nations. ACEJMC will apply its standards and indicators in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, where appropriate, with religious or cultural prescriptions and practices. ACEJMC standards apply to all delivery channels including, but not limited to, traditional face-to-face instruction on the home campus or other locations, distance instruction using any technology, or a blend of distance and face-to-face instruction. The Nine Accrediting Standards 1. Mission, Governance and Administration The policies and practices of the unit ensure that it has an effectively and fairly administered working and learning environment. 2. Curriculum and Instruction The unit provides a curriculum and instruction, whether on-site or online, that enable students to learn the knowledge, competencies and values the Council defines for preparing students to work in a diverse global and domestic society. 3. Diversity and Inclusiveness The unit has an inclusive program that values domestic and global diversity, and serves and reflects society. 4. Full-Time and Part-Time Faculty The unit hires, supports and evaluates a capable faculty with a balance of academic and professional credentials appropriate for the unit's mission. 5. Scholarship: Research, Creative and Professional Activity With unit support, faculty members contribute to the advancement of scholarly and professional knowledge and engage in scholarship (research, creative and professional activity) that contributes to their development. 6. Student Services The unit provides students with the support and services that promote learning and ensure timely completion of their program of study. OPEN - ASARED - 1-31 September 2, 20217. Resources, Facilities and Equipment The unit plans for, seeks and receives adequate resources to fulfill and sustain its mission. 8. Professional and Public Service The unit and its faculty advance journalism and mass communication professions, fulfilling obligations to its community, alumni and the greater public. 9. Assessment of Learning Outcomes The unit regularly assesses student learning and applies results to improve curriculum and instruction. ACEJMC's \"Guide to Assessment of Learning Outcomes\" for accreditation lists professional values and competencies that must be part of the education of all journalism and strategic communication students. Based upon ACEJMC's guidelines, we have developed six program outcomes that correspond to the values and competencies for accreditation. Graduates should be able to: Outcome 1: Describe theories, concepts, and ethical principles in urban journalism and strategic communication ACEJMC: \"understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information.\" Outcome 2: Apply skills to produce content for both traditional and digital media to meet professional standards ACEJMC: \"apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.\" Outcome 3: Analyze urban influences on communities inside and outside urban areas ACEJMC: \"contribute to knowledge appropriate to the communications professions in which they work.\" Outcome 4: Write effective content for news reporting and advertising across all media platforms ACEJMC: \"write correctly and clearly in forms and styles appropriate for the communications professions, audiences and purposes they serve ... [and with] clarity, appropriate style and grammatical correctness.\" Outcome 5: Examine cultural diversity and its significance in U.S. and global societies ACEJMC: \"demonstrate an understanding of the diversity of peoples and cultures and of the significance and impact of mass communications in a global society ...and forms of diversity in domestic society in relation to mass communications. OPEN - ASARED - 1-32 September 2, 2021 Outcome 6: Evaluate research methods that are applicable to the profession ACEJMC: \"conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which they work. The following methods are to be followed to gain ACEJMC accreditation for journalism at UMKC: Assessments would be conducted in COMMST 203 and COMMST 270. All of these are required introductory courses for journalism students. Then, assessments would occur in COMM ST 387, COMM ST 432, and COMM ST 453, three required upper-division classes. Assessing student learning outcomes in both introductory and upper-division classes would allow for the examination of student progression by comparing the lower (203 & 270) and upper (387, 432 & 453) results. The assessment measures will use a student portfolio, which is a collection of various forms of student artifacts accomplished in the assessed classes. Cumulatively, the assessment measures will use various forms of student work as opposed to one. This includes journalism research proposals, writing skills, critical thinking essays, awareness of complex public policy and societal, cultural and ethical issues, multimedia artifacts, persuasive essays constructing arguments, and utilizing media research/sources, and/or conducting interviews to be assessed, conceptual papers describing theories and concepts in urban journalism and strategic communication. Assessments of student learning outcomes in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communication would be conducted over a two-year period. ACEJMC's process of accreditation follows four steps, as stated in the agency's assessment guide: The unit undertakes a self-study, a rigorous and detailed examination of the program by faculty, administrators and students. A team consisting of educators and professionals visits the campus to assess curriculum, faculty, administration, students, facilities and resources. The National Accrediting Committee, composed of educators and professionals, each year reviews and discusses the reports of all the site teams and votes whether to recommend each unit to the Accrediting Council for accreditation. The National Accrediting Council reviews the work of the site teams and the recommendations of the Accrediting Committee and takes final action. OPEN - ASARED - 1-33 September 2, 20216. Appendices Appendix 1. Support Letters OPEN - ASARED - 1-34 September 2, 2021 OPEN - ASARED - 1-35 September 2, 2021 May 27, 2021 To: The University of Missouri Board of Curators KCUR, the public media station here at UMKC, is strongly supportive of the efforts to establish a major in Urban Journalism and Strategic Communications within the UMKC Communication Studies Department. We take great pride in our commitment to excellence in journalism, and this similar commitment by the university will go a long way toward helping us strengthen our work. Although we have mentored and even hired some outstanding students from the Communications Studies Department, the lion's share of training happens when these raw prospective journalists get here. By building a major that is unique among journalism emphases in the MU system, UMKC will bring in students with the highest aspirations and drive to be complete journalists focused on the most important stories of the day. We particularly applaud the focus on urban issues, which are often under-reported or handled as drop-in work rather than true immersion into communities. Crime, race, poverty, education, transportation, sprawl...these issues evolve quickly and a deep knowledge of historical and current perspectives would help reporters provide the truest understanding for an audience hungry for credible voices and analysis. And with the current political climate and concerns about an urban/rural divide, there is a danger that issues of particular impact in urban communities could be lost in this shift. Thus, we believe there is real urgency for UMKC to create this Urban Journalism and Strategic Communications major. KCUR would like to be a partner in how the major develops, offering internships and other training opportunities for students. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.

Student Support Letters Letter 1: From Caleb Robbins May 6, 2021 To the University of Missouri Board of Curators: As a current senior at University of Missouri-Kansas City, I am happy to say that I am nearing the end of my journey with more knowledge about journalism than I could've ever asked for. However, if there is one regret that I do have, it is that I was unable to obtain my degree major in journalism. For all the things I love about UMKC, the one reason it wasn't my first choice coming out of high school was because they didn't offer a degree major in journalism, only an emphasis. The only university that offered this at an undergraduate level was Mizzou. As much I respected Mizzou's revered J-school, I quickly realized that an intercity kid and minority such as myself from Kansas would not be able to afford the non-resident tuition fees that are 40k/year. After discussions with my academic counselor, I chose UMKC to major in communications and obtain an emphasis in journalism. During my time here, I have taken courses with professors whose resumes in journalism are worthy of a journalism major at our school and as a contributor to our university newspaper, UNews, I can confidently say that UMKC students are as deserving as any student across the US. Respectfully, I ask that you carefully consider the students in your decision process and understand the consequences of withholding opportunities for the less fortunate. Requiring students to travel 100 miles from home to have a chance at obtaining a journalism degree is not ideal, especially in this current climate. Many students and I have an attachment to Kansas City, and we want to represent our hometown as the future generation of journalists. Please allow us this opportunity. Thank you, Caleb Robbins OPEN - ASARED - 1-42 September 2, 2021Letter 2: Caleb Wilson May 5, 2021 To the University of Missouri Board of Curators: My name is Caleb Wilson, and I am the managing editor for UMKC's student newspaper University News. I believe UMKC would greatly benefit from having its own, dedicated journalism major for two particular reasons. Firstly, I think there may be a large contingent of students interested in journalism already at the university who do not pursue it simply because they are not interested in having a communications degree with a journalism emphasis only. It seems plausible to me based on my experience and my discussions with other students that there are those who do not care to study the sectors of a communications degree that do not overlap directly with journalism, and as such have been swayed to stay away from the program all together. In my own case, as a student who has written for the paper for nearly two years and also served as a member of the editorial staff for an additional year, I will not be graduating with a degree in communications, nor have I sought to do so. The same can be said for our Editor-in-Chief, who also is not a member of the communications program. If there had been a dedicated journalism program, I believe firmly that both he and I would have participated in the degree program. Secondly, the Kansas City area has a plethora of career opportunities that students in journalism programs elsewhere would jump at, with major publications in the city that would provide great internship settings and career-building possibilities. I find it to be a great shame that in a growing city, rife with opportunities to cover important news, that there is no dedicated journalism program. I believe that the success of our student newspaper, which has been recognized as the second- best student newspaper in the state, shows how there is a genuine opening to cover real, important news in a city that UMKC students are closely tied to. A journalism program would thrive in just such an environment, with the aid of the fantastic faculty that we already have within the university. I hope that you will deeply consider the positive ramifications a journalism program at UMKC would have not only on the student body, but on the university itself. Sincerely, Caleb Wilson OPEN - ASARED - 2-1 September 2, 2021Executive Summary New Degree Program, Bachelor of Applied Science, UMKC The University of Missouri-Kansas City is proposing a Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree. The BAS degree program is unique from the existing BA, BS, BBA, and BLA degrees because of the experience and education of its target population and the requirements of the program. The BAS degree targets students with an Associate of Applied Science degree (AAS) from an accredited institution. An AAS degree is focused on a specific career path, which distinguishes it from other associate degrees. AAS degree holders do not have an easy path to degree completion within the UM System because much of their coursework is technical or career specific. AAS credits do not typically transfer to traditional baccalaureate programs, meaning that students who wish to return to higher education for career advancement must start near the beginning of a four-year degree program. The BAS program allows students to use their AAS credits toward their BAS degree (up to 60 hours), thus recognizing the technical knowledge and experience transfer students with an applied degree bring to UMKC and enabling them to enter the workforce with a bachelor's degree in two years. For example, a student completing an AAS in Interior Design and enrolling in a traditional baccalaureate program may need to complete 108 additional credit hours at UMKC. With the BAS, this same student would need to complete only 63 hours at UMKC. The BAS seeks to ease the transition of AAS students from their two-year technical degree to a bachelor's degree and serve a new population of students. This innovative degree program empowers students to use their prior training to fulfill their career and professional goals. The curriculum combines in-demand skills like critical thinking, communication, ethics, teamwork, and complex problem-solving skills with expertise development in business and organizational leadership, healthcare management, data analytics, digital media, and digital humanities. These are the exact skills cited by employers as important in a recent survey by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U). UMKC is uniquely positioned to shepherd the development of an interdisciplinary degree like the BAS as the College of Arts and Sciences has experience with interdisciplinary degree programs and adult learners. The College of Arts and Sciences has strong connections with other units on campus and with the UMKC Essentials general education program to ensure different options for degree completion. We can implement this program with our existing faculty and minimal resources. We anticipate the program will grow steadily over time and that this growth will necessitate a hire in Year 5. As we discuss below, there are two regional competitors offering BAS programs (Missouri Southern State University and Northwest Missouri State University), but no programs in the UM System. Our BAS program can serve as a first step toward offering BAS programs on the other system campuses and as part of Missouri Online.

Our BAS program can serve as a first step toward offering BAS programs on the other system campuses and as part of Missouri Online. 1. Introduction This document outlines our proposal for a Bachelor of Applied Science degree to be offered by the College of Arts and Sciences at UMKC. This degree program aligns well with the mission and strategic plan of UMKC to provide educational experiences designed to meet students where they are in their career and life experiences. The College of Arts and Sciences has substantial experience serving transfer students, including adult learners, in an interdisciplinary environment. This experience puts us in a unique position to offer this innovative and interdisciplinary degree program. Through a combination of impactful and engaging classroom, online, academic support and co-curricular experiences, we will provide lifelong learning, delivered through an ever-evolving array of flexible, diverse, personalized formats. The program's cross-campus collaborative approach, designed to rely on existing resources, ensures that the program will be cost-effective. This interdisciplinary degree is designed for students who have completed an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and would benefit from a baccalaureate degree for career progression or personal development. Interested students will transfer to UMKC with up to 60 credits. The BAS will consist of a common core in five broad categories (13 hours), an emphasis area (18-24 hours) with coursework from across UMKC, and any remaining general education credits necessary to reach 120 credit hours. Students will work closely with the Director of the BAS to select an emphasis area that best fits their individual needs. Whereas typical bachelor's degree programs (BA, BS, BLA, etc.) are well-designed to align with the experience and education of students completing a traditional associate degree (Associate of Arts or Associate of Science), the BAS degree program is designed to align with the unmet educational needs of students completing an AAS degree. An AAS degree is focused on a specific career path, such as Administrative Assistant, Logistics, Health Information Management, and Graphic Design, which distinguishes it from an AS or AA degree focused on a specific discipline (e.g., Biology, Sociology, and Art). Students pursuing an AAS degree typically complete a small number of general education courses (<18) and then complete the remaining hours in a specific program (technical hours). Without the existence of a BAS degree option, students find these technical hours do not easily transfer to a four-year degree program. The BAS degree program seeks to ease the transition of AAS students from their two-year technical degree to a bachelor's degree and thus grow our transfer enrollment. Specifically, students transferring to UMKC with an AAS degree enter the BAS program as juniors (with up to 60 credit hours from their AAS degree program). OPEN - ASARED - 2-7 September 2, 2021 This degree program was built to provide students with critical skills cited by employers as important for their employees. A recent survey by the AAC&U queried 500 executives and hiring managers about the important learning outcomes they value. Our BAS core coursework incorporates many of the top skills cited by employers, including: Critical thinking skills Ability to demonstrate complex problem-solving skills Ethical judgment and reasoning Ability to communicate through writing Ability to communicate through speaking Ability to communicate/work with people from different cultural backgrounds Ability to work effectively in teams Civic skills and civic engagement Ability to integrate ideas/information across settings and contexts The course offerings in the BAS core aim to broaden students' professional skills, provide them with a foundation applicable to all career fields, and ensure they stay competitive for the ever-increasing number of careers requiring a bachelor's degree.3 Building on this core, students select an emphasis area tailored to ensure employment in a high-demand field. Our emphasis areas provide critical training in highly sought-after professional areas: Health Services Management, Business and Organizational Leadership, Data Analytics, Digital Media, and Digital and Public Humanities. Each emphasis area has a unique set of career paths for students. For example, students in the Health Services Management emphasis area may find careers in hospitals, outpatient care facilities, assisted living facilities, government agencies, or rehabilitation facilities fit their career goals. Still other students choosing the Business and Organizational Leadership emphasis area will find themselves well- prepared to move into supervisory or managerial positions in both the private and public sector. While housed in the College of Arts and Sciences, the BAS program is a collaborative effort with three additional units at UMKC\u2014the Bloch School of Management, the School of Computing and Engineering, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences\u2014with furthe r collaborations with other units possible. Working with these collaborators across campus, we have developed the curriculum and the key courses serving the BAS core and the five emphasis areas. This cooperative curricular design takes advantage of faculty expertise in units across campus and allows us to streamline the costs of this new degree program. All courses in this proposal, save the 3 The Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce notes that <30% of jobs required a bachelor's degree or higher in 1973. This number has ballooned to 64% by 2020. https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp- content/uploads/2014/11/Recovery2020.ES_.Web_.pdf OPEN - ASARED - 2-8 September 2, 2021 first-semester experience course tailored for BAS students, serve students in our other degree programs. For example, courses in the Digital Media emphasis area will serve students in the BAS and students in the new Media Art and Design degree program and well as students in Art, Communication Studies, and English. The Director of the BAS will report directly to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and will oversee the implementation and operation of the program. The Director will be a faculty member actively involved in the development of the BAS program and will receive a small stipend to direct the program. The Director will be expected to teach the first-semester experience course (A&S 311) as part of their normal teaching load. 2. University Mission & Program Analysis 2.A. Alignment with University Mission & Goals This innovative degree program aligns with multiple pillars in UMKC's Strategic Plan, mission, and the university's plans for UMKC Forward. The BAS program fits squarely into Pillar 1 of UMKC's Strategic Plan: \"Provide exceptional student learning, success and experience.\" In particular, the Strategic Plan4 states: We are committed to providing customized educational experiences tailored to each individual's needs, through a combination of impactful and engaging classroom, online, academic support and co-curricular experiences. We will be a provider of lifelong learning, delivered through an ever-evolving array of flexible, diverse, personalized formats. This flexible degree is tailored to students with two-year Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees from accredited institutions. Our program seeks to ease the transition of students from their technical degree to the completion of a bachelor's degree by allowing them to apply up to sixty of their technical AAS credits to the BAS. AAS credits do not typically transfer to traditional baccalaureate programs, so allowing students to apply sixty hours toward their BAS degree ensures students can complete the BAS degree requirements in two years. The BAS provides students with a clear and valuable path to degree completion, one that offers online and evening courses as well as a customizable curricular path to meet the needs of a diverse student population. This fits squarely with the desire of Pillar 1 to provide lifelong learning opportunities for the community. 4 UMKC Strategic Plan 2018-2028; https://www.umkc.edu/about/documents/Strategic-Plan-2018.pdf OPEN - ASARED - 2-9 September 2, 2021 In addition, the BAS aligns with Pillar 3 of the UMKC Strategic Plan: \"Transform our community and region with impactful engagement.\" This degree program will create paths to career advancement in technical industries in our region, which are in need of management and supervisory roles. Indeed, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC), there are nearly 1,000 annual job openings in the Kansas City area in management occupations requiring a bachelor's degree or higher; these occupations are projected to see an 11% increase by 2026.5 Workforce needs will be addressed in more detail in Section 3.A of this proposal. Pillar 4 of the UMKC Strategic Plan endeavors to \"foster an environment of invigorating multiculturalism, globalism, diversity and inclusion.\" The BAS degree program is designed to open the path to a bachelor's degree to a subset of the local population who may not otherwise return to college. These students will broaden our diverse population, inviting perspectives from students with many different experiences and career fields. Students with AAS degrees are likely to have worked for years in technical fields, and their perspectives will enhance the campus atmosphere as they engage with faculty and peers. The BAS program also has direct ties to UMKC's Mission: As an urban research university, our mission at the University of Missouri- Kansas City is to promote learning through the discovery, preservation and dissemination of knowledge of public value across a broad spectrum of disciplines and fields of study. UMKC celebrates the individual and embodies diversity and inclusion by intertwining these goals with innovation to enable transformational impact aimed at bringing cultural, social, health and economic prosperity to the metropolitan, regional and global communities we serve.6 We have designed the BAS to be highly interdisciplinary and to involve units and departments across the UMKC campus. The BAS curriculum is built to rely on the expertise of faculty in a range of disciplines, with plans for further collaborative development. The program will have a transformational impact in our local and regional communities as it creates a path toward career growth in technical industries, increasing opportunity for economic prosperity on an individual as well as a corporate level. Graduates of this program will have advanced skills in leadership and critical thinking that will benefit employers as well as open up new career opportunities. Moreover, in the course of developing this degree program, UMKC launched UMKC Forward, an initiative aimed at realigning campus priorities and investing in creative 5 Kansas City Region Occupational Projections 2016-2026; produced by MERIC; https:// umkc.box.com/s/u967j8hvgb9uloww9jh6bgpx5k91t5xa 6 https://www.umkc.edu/about/mission.html OPEN - ASARED - 2-10 September 2, 2021 opportunities for growth. The BAS degree was named as a key initiative in the UMKC Fo rward plan: From Chancellor Agrawal's August 12, 2020 announcement of UMKC Forward immediate actions: Launch a new Bachelor of Applied Sciences degree, to enhance our ability to further attract and retain transfer students and fast track new degree programs under development in selected high demand areas. As evidenced by the letters of support included in the appendix, support for the BAS stretches across campus. The degree will attract a new subset of transfer students, allowing those with Applied Science degrees from community and technical colleges a more streamlined pathway to achieve an innovative and highly relevant bachelor's degree and advance in their careers. The chosen emphasis areas are aligned with selected high-demand areas in the local and regional workforce, especially the areas of Health Science Management, Business and Organizational Leadership, and Data Analytics. These areas stood out in our Burning Glass analysis. The BAS degree aligns well with the goals of the College of Arts and Sciences. The College emphasizes interdisciplinarity and collaboration across its 17 departments, and this program accomplishes those parallel goals within its core curriculum, which includes courses from several departments. Skills such as critical thinking, ethics, and professional communication are key objectives in programs in the arts, humanities, social, and natural sciences, and the BAS core curriculum plays to those strengths. 2.B. Duplication & Collaboration within Campus, Across System UMKC's proposed Bachelor of Applied Science degree is unique within the University of Missouri System. No other program targets students with Associate of Applied Science degrees and allows them to transfer their technical credits toward a bachelor- level degree to gain critical skills for career advancement. Similar programs may include the Bachelor of Liberal Arts (BLA) at UMKC, the Bachelor of General Studies (BGS) at MU, and the Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS) at UMSL (Online). The BLA and BGS degrees are distinct from a BAS in that they offer an individualized path to a bachelor's degree, designed around students' personal interests and career plans. The BLS Online is similarly individualized, though it is also noted as a path toward degree completion. In contrast, the BAS degree has a structured core curriculum as well as set emphasis areas. This structure allows for flexibility based on students' interests and prior experience, but it also provides students with a common set of critical skills such as professional communication, ethics, and leadership and an emphasis area tailored to their professional goals. The BAS is a degree completion program for students with an AAS degree desiring career advancement, career change, or personal growth. As described above, this target population typically faces limited baccalaureate options. OPEN - ASARED - 2-11 September 2, 2021 Interim Dean Kati Toivanen reached out to College of Arts & Sciences Deans at other campuses in the UM System to discuss this proposed BAS degree program. Interim Dean Toivanen met with then Dean Patricia Okker from MU on March 3, 2021. Dean Okker noted no conflicts within her unit and expressed support for this initiative, but suggested we reach out to the School of Health Professions. We met with their leadership (Dean Hagglund and Senior Associate Dean Stephanie Reid-Arndt). We met with the SHS and addressed their concerns (see email in appendix). Interim Dean Toivanen also met with Dean Andrew Kersten from UMSL on February 25, 2021. Dean Kersten shared Dean Okker's support for the degree, noting one similar degree housed in UMSL's Sociology Department, the Bachelor of Arts in Organizational Leadership (the supporting emails are included). We met with the director of this program, who offered his support. This degree differs from the proposed BAS in that it is more directed toward management skills, whereas our proposed curriculum has a broader focus on career growth in a variety of disciplines, from Business and Organizational Leadership to Data Analytics. Another differentiating factor is the opportunity for students to transfer their technical credits from AAS degrees to earn the BAS degree. Regionally, there are two Missouri institutions which offer a Bachelor of Applied Science degree: Missouri Southern State University (MSSU) and Northwest Missouri State University (NWMSU). See the below chart for a quick reference guide comparing the BAS programs at UMKC, MSSU, and NWMSU. BAS programs typically target students interested in advancing within their chosen career or students seeking a degree completion program. Programs focused on the first group tend to provide a specialized, technical curriculum in the same discipline as the student's AAS degree (e.g., NWMSU). Programs focused on the latter group tend to offer a more general degree program covering broad-based skills (e.g., MSSU). At MSSU, BAS students take the Missouri Core 42 plus any minor offered at the university. At NWMSU, BAS students have general education requirements and only one required course, as well as emphasis areas with an entirely flexible curriculum. Our program, however, targets both populations with our core and emphasis area curriculum. Our program is also valuable to students in technical careers desiring to switch career paths without sacrificing the technical credits they have earned. UMKC's proposed BAS program is stronger than these regional competitors because it combines a common core aimed at broadening students' professional and leadership skills (communication, ethics, engagement, and diversity) with discipline- specific training in emphasis areas, whereas most BAS programs tend to align with only one of those goals. Further, we have incorporated some of the general education curriculum from UMKC Essentials into the core curriculum, creating a quicker pathway to degree completion without compromising the integrity of the general education objectives.

Emphasis areas will deliver discipline- specific advanced skills. This BAS is advertised as a complet ion program for students wishing to advance their caree rs. All BAS students take general education cour ses and a digital literacy course. Other skills are gained in emphasis area coursework. No skills tailored for this degree program. Once we have a chance to work with this population and develop these online resources, we anticipate moving into the online space with this program. Many of our prospective students would benefit from the hands-on nature of the first-semester experience course and on-campus resources\u2014writing studio, library, advising, and financial aid. As the program matures, we see clear opportunities for collaboration with our partners at the other UM campuses through course-sharing and through development of BAS degrees on their campuses and through Missouri Online. OPEN - ASARED - 2-14 September 2, 2021 3. Business-Related Criteria & Justification 3.A. Market Analysis 3.A.1. Rationale & Workforce Demand for the Program As described earlier, this program was built to serve a population of students underserved by our traditional degree programs at UMKC: students with the Associate of Applied Science degree. In constructing this program, we examined surveys of employers to identify the key competencies that employers are looking for in future employees. We structured our core curriculum to ensure our graduates would possess these key competencies and be able to demonstrate as such to employers (through our learning plans and assessment portfolios) upon graduation. To illustrate, a recent survey by the AAC&U asked 500 executive and hiring managers to identify the key competencies they value. The following table maps our core curriculum to those competencies. Key Competencies from Employers BAS Curriculum Critical thinking skills UMKC Essentials + BAS Core (Ethics and Leadership Course) Ability to demonstrate complex problem- solving skills BAS Core (Civic and Urban En gagement Course) Ethical judgment and reasoning BAS Core (Ethics and Leadership Course) Ability to communicate through writing UMKC Essentials + BAS Core (Pr ofessional Communication) Ability to communicate through speaking UMKC Essentials + BAS Core (Pr ofessional Communication) Ability to communicate/work with people from different cultural backgrounds UMKC Essentials + BAS Core (Pr ofessional Communication and Culture and Diversity) Ability to work effectively in teams BAS Core (A&S 311 and Civic and Urban Engagement Course) Civic Skills and Civic Engagement BAS Core (Civic and Urban En gagement Course) Beyond the BAS core, students choose an emphasis area developed to ensure employment opportunities in high demand fields. The emphasis areas target particular skills and careers building on the AAS degrees and employment history of our target population. Our emphasis areas provide critical training in highly sought- after professional areas: health services management, business and organizational leadership, data analytics, digital media, and digital and public humanities. Each emphasis area has a unique set of career paths for students. OPEN - ASARED - 2-15 September 2, 2021 To identify the emphasis areas included in the BAS, we consulted multiple sources including Burning Glass and MERIC. The Burning Glass research (included in the appendix) examined job postings in Missouri and its eight contiguous states for the last year for postings requiring a bachelor's degree. The analysis identified over a million job postings with most postings in the metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, but smaller pockets in other metropolitan areas including Springfield and Jefferson City in Missouri and Wichita and Topeka in Kansas. Many of the top occupations are careers strongly tied to the BAS core and emphasis areas.7 Sales representatives (49,543 postings) Managers, All Other (45,062 postings) Medical and Health Services Managers (25,425 postings) Sales Managers (24,983postings) General and Operations Managers (23,536 postings) Human resource specialists (19,881 postings) Marketing Managers (19,542 postings) First-Line Supervisors (18,553 postings) Management Analysts (17,489 postings) Financial Managers, Branch or Department (14,581 postings) Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists (12,225 postings) First Line Supervisors of Office and Administrative Support Workers (9,062 postings) Operations Research Analysts (8,310 postings) This analysis also provided a list of employers with the greatest number of postings over this same period. The top employers are healthcare corporations and non- healthcare employers as well as educational institutions. These are all employers that would value the critical skills provided by the BAS program. We reached out to prominent employers in areas relevant to our BAS degree (e.g., the Kansas City Public Library). The letters of support from these employers are included in the appendix. What these letters share is an acknowledgement of the importance of the degree program to both prospective students and employers. Students have a clear path to a baccalaureate degree and employers have access to an expanded applicant pool with technical experience and key competencies. As more and more jobs require baccalaureate degrees, the pool of available applicants has shrunk. The BAS program will provide an additional pool of prospective applicants. Moreover, the strengths of transfer students are now being recognized by higher education in new ways. Research indicates that transfer students, like our prospective students, are underappreciated for their resilience and innovation.8 7 Market analysis research conducted by the Associate Vice Provost for Academic Innovation at UMKC. 8 https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-06-02-want-to-hire-an-innovative-college-graduate-choose-a-transfer-student OPEN - ASARED - 2-16 September 2, 2021 As noted earlier, there are two regional competitors with BAS degree programs. However, these programs are distinct from the BAS program proposed here. This presents an opportunity for UMKC and the UM System to be a leader in this area especially within the Missouri and Kansas region. We can provide a high-quality educational experience to students currently underserved and pave the way for their future career success through skill development and degree completion. This innovative degree program presents a major opportunity to equip the region's workforce with in-demand education and skills. The ease of transfer allowed by the program will create opportunities for workers to augment their earning power and job opportunities through the acquisition of bachelor's degrees with core training and emphasis areas in high-demand fields such as health services management, business and organizational leadership, data analytics, digital media, and digital humanities. The attached letter from one of our community college partners, Metropolitan Community College, testifies to the impact that this opportunity will have for community college students seeking to grow their skills, credentials, and earnings. MCC and our two other community college partners, Johnson County Community College and Kansas City Kansas Community College, have been consulted in the development of this degree - thus it reflects the input not only of our campus faculty and staff, but that of the population we aim to serve. We presented the BAS proposal to the College of Arts and Sciences Alumni Board. While our alumni graduated with BA, BS, or BLA degrees, they recognize the challenges students with an AAS degree often face at four-year institutions and the prospect for expanding educational opportunities for students with an AAS (see the email responses from several of our alums in the appendix). Critically, our recruitment team in the College of Arts and Sciences expresses enthusiasm for a program that would provide a clear path to completion for transfer students with an AAS (see letter of support in appendix). 3.A.2. Student Demand for the Program The BAS program at UMKC is unique from its regional competitors in its focus on critical skills and in-demand growth areas. It is also a unique degree for UMKC and targets a distinct population. The motivation for this proposal comes from student need. Anecdotal evidence from our advising team indicated that students with an AAS degree were struggling to attend and complete their degrees. Before proposing the BAS degree, we substantiated this evidence. We started by exploring the awarding of AAS degrees by our three local community college partners: Metropolitan Community College (MCC), Johnson County Community College (JCCC), and Kansas City Kansas OPEN - ASARED - 2-17 September 2, 2021 Community College (KCKCC). Our partners report that 14%9, 23%10, and 18%11, respectively, of their graduates earned AAS degrees over the last few years. While AA and AS degrees remain the most common associate degrees, the AAS continues to be the degree of choice for many students in Missouri. When queried, MDHE reports that the state of Missouri graduates 3,500 AAS students each year. In addition to community colleges, AAS degrees are the degree of choice for technical colleges, including many for profit schools. Finally, the AAS degree is also the degree of choice for a large portion of the veteran population in the United States. The Community College of the Air Force awards 22,000 AAS degrees annually across 71 AAS degree programs.12 Though this is the degree offered by the CCAF, military personnel are often cautioned against the AAS because it \"can be limiting when it comes to pursuing higher education later.\"13 This is the exact problem we seek to solve. These graduation rates suggest the potential demand for a BAS degree, but we wanted to ensure that we offered a degree program that would: (a) provide students with a curriculum tailored to the unique needs and goals of students with an AAS degree, and (b) not detract from our traditional BA and BS programs. If AAS students are served well by our current BA or BS programs, then a BAS would not be as critical. The evidence, however, suggests otherwise. We collected data on the number of students admitted to UMKC with an AAS degree, the yield rate for those students (that is, how many of those students enroll at the university), and the graduation rate for those students. We excluded students applying to our Dental Hygiene or RN to BSN programs as these are completion programs designed in a similar vein to the BAS and serving a very specific student population. The figure below illustrates the results of this analysis. UMKC had 300 students admitted with an AAS degree from 2018-2020. Of those students, 20% matriculated. Of those matriculating, only 15% have since graduated with a bachelor's degree. To put this in perspective, the yield rate for transfer students across the board in the College of Arts and Sciences is 75% and the graduation rate is over 60%. There are two key takeaways from this figure. Our current degree programs are not attracting sufficient interest from students with an AAS. 9 https://mcckc.edu/research/docs/Annual_Factbook.pdf 10 http://catalog.jccc.edu/degreerequirements/associate-applied-science/ 11 https://www.kckcc.edu/files/docs/ie/enrollment-and-degrees/final_kckcc_degrees-awarded-2013-2018_ipeds_cip.pdf 12 https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Barnes/CCAF/ 13 https://www.military.com/education/getting-your-degree/3-reasons-to-get-your-associate-degree.html OPEN - ASARED - 2-18 September 2, 2021 When students do express interest, they struggle with completing the degree in a timely manner. As a result of this evidence, we designed the BAS to appeal to this target population and to facilitate their persistence and degree completion. OPEN - ASARED - 2-19 September 2, 2021 To demonstrate the benefit of the BAS program for AAS students, we examined the extent to which their AAS credits would transfer to UMKC under our traditional programs. The chart below illustrates the transfer course equivalencies of two AAS degrees: Administrative Assistant AAS and Interior Design AAS. As one can see, the transfer equivalencies vary by AAS degree. The Administrative Assistant AAS has many more courses that have either direct equivalencies or can receive elective credit. In contrast, students with an AAS in Interior Design would receive very little credit under a traditional degree program. With the BAS program, the student would be able to transfer up to 60 hours toward their bachelor's degree including technical coursework.

In the chart below, we list the BBA requirements and the BAS requirements and indicate whether a requirement would be fulfilled by the AAS coursework. As is evident, the time to graduation is significantly longer with the more traditional baccalaureate programs for a student with an AAS. Because AAS degrees vary in the number of general education credits they require and the technical nature of the program, this fluctuates by type of AAS. For students with an AAS in Administrative Assistance, the time to completion for a BBA is 3.3 years or 99 hours. If the student enrolled in the BAS program, the student would be able to complete the degree in 60 hours or 2 years.

In estimating enrollment, we made a few assumptions. Our transfer population in the College of Arts and Sciences is 20% part- time and 80% full-time. As a result, we have used that distribution in our calculations for both enrollment and the financial forecast. Our retention rate for full-time transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences is 75% and our retention rate for part- time students is 52%. Though we anticipate doing better in retaining part-time BAS students with our targeted retention efforts, we used these retention rates in the enrollment calculations and financial forecast. The number of degrees awarded is calculated using the number of part-time and full- time students projected in Table 1a combined with our retention rates. We assume that part-time students will complete their BAS degree in three years and full-time students will complete their degree in two years. Table 1a.

Financial Projections The financial projections for the BAS degree program are included in the detailed pro forma in the appendix and detailed below. We expect the program to generate revenue in Year 1, as we have built the program to rely on the strengths and resources of the current faculty at UMKC. Our revenue estimates are built on the student projections detailed above and are split between full-time and part-time students. Given the population, we expect 20% to be part-time students and 80% to be full-time students. Full-time students are expected to complete thirty credit hours per year whereas part-time students are likely to complete 20 credit hours per year. Assumptions included in financial projections: Given the requirements for the degree program (an AAS degree), we do not anticipate any transfers from within campus or any FTC students. As such, our financial projections are built on a 60-hour completion plan (two years of revenue and costs per student). Our student projections are based on the AAS graduation rates in Missouri, the graduate rates of our feeder schools, our experience with other flexible degree programs at UMKC (Bachelor of Health Science and Bachelor of Liberal Arts) and data from other BAS programs. We assume full-time students will take 30 credit hours per academic year and part-time students will take 20 credit hours per academic year. For our analyses, we used a rate of $288 per credit hour estimate for FY23 and a 2% tuition increase in future years. We used the in-state tuition rate, which applies to both Kansas and Missouri students. Given the paucity of BAS programs in our region, this likely underestimates the tuition revenue. 3.B.1. Additional Resources Needed The College of Arts and Sciences will be able to implement the BAS program using existing faculty and staff. The program relies on core courses cross leveled with other UMKC Essentials courses, existing courses within the College of Arts and Sciences, and collaborations with other units for emphasis area course offerings. Expenses will include faculty and staff salaries and benefits, marketing costs, course development costs, start-up costs, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses. Tuition revenue will fund these expenses. A full financial projection worksheet (pro forma) is included. OPEN - ASARED - 2-24 September 2, 2021 In Years 1-4, we do not anticipate hiring any full-time faculty. We will need to hire part-time faculty to cover core BAS courses, general education needs and courses in the emphasis areas. In Table 2, these part-time hiring costs appear in the row labeled Faculty. This includes both the costs of offering the core BAS courses and the costs of adding the BAS students to general education courses and emphasis area courses (labeled payroll outside of program in the pro forma worksheet). As the program grows, we will need targeted hires to support our emphasis areas. Given our enrollment projections and our curriculum, we anticipate a full-time hire would be needed in Year 5 when enrollment in the program exceeds 100 students. This hire would be contingent on the program meeting enrollment projections and would be full-time faculty supporting multiple degree programs. As UMKC is expanding its reach in data analytics, we anticipate this faculty member would be focused in Data Analytics and support the BAS and our DA programs in the Bloch School of Management, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the School of Computing and Engineering. Any full-time faculty hires would require a start-up budget for teaching and research. We will need administrative support and mentoring in the form of a Director of the BAS (a current faculty member receiving a small stipend and course reduction) and a part-time staff person. As the program grows, we anticipate a full-time staff person will become necessary by Year 5. The amount included for staffing were based on the average salary and wages for staff members in this role in the College of Arts and Sciences. We have included a small budget for incidentals (supplies, copying, etc.) and a marketing budget. The initial marketing budget (Year 0) will include development of marketing materials while the recurring marketing budget appearing in Table 2 focuses on the costs of printing and distribution of the materials. Our marketing efforts for the BAS degree program will be coordinated with existing unit and campus marketing efforts to minimize costs during the initial years of the program. 3.B.2. Revenue Revenue will be generated from tuition. 3.B.3. Net Revenue The program will yield a net positive revenue immediately given the reliance on existing resources. The main cost in Years 1-4 will be basic incidental and part-time faculty costs. Part-time faculty will be hired only as enrollment increases. These minimal costs will be covered by the tuition revenue each year. OPEN - ASARED - 2-25 September 2, 2021 Table 2. Financial Projections for Proposed Program for Years 1 - 5 Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 1. Expenses per year A.

Academic and Financial Viability The combination of a core BAS curriculum focused on developing key skills (critical thinking, ethics, leadership, professional communication, etc.) and emphasis areas developed to advance the professional goals of our students will provide BAS students with a strong academic background. The BAS program is structured to rely heavily on pre-existing courses, so very few students are needed to ensure the program is financially viable (10). However, we expect many more students to be interested in the degree program than the minimum needed for financial viability. Because the courses serving the BAS program serve other degree programs, academic viability in the form of courses making our enrollment minimums (15 students) should not be challenging. The College of Arts and Sciences will track the enrollment in the BAS program. After five years, the College of Arts and Sciences will assess the program's viability. If average enrollment does not correspond to the below table, we will assess the program's viability and consider changes to enhance its financial and academic viability, including the possibility of placing the program on inactive status. We will continue this assessment as part of our five-year program review process. Table 3. Enrollment for Academic and Financial Viability Viability Minimum Enrollment Academic 15 Financial 10 Overall 15 OPEN - ASARED - 2-27 September 2, 2021 3.C. Business Plan: Marketing, Student Success, Transition & Exit Strategies 3.C.1. Marketing Plan The target audience includes individuals with an AAS degree who are seeking career advancement in their technical field, personal development in the pursuit of a bachelor's degree, and a switch in career paths. As such, our marketing and recruitment strategy will focus on community and technical colleges as well as community partnerships. We plan substantial marketing and recruitment efforts coordinated by the Manager of Recruitment in the College of Arts and Sciences who will collaborate with Admissions, UMKC's Strategic Marketing and Communications group, and recruitment managers across campus to develop a unified marketing plan for the BAS. Our Manager of Recruitment also has extensive ties to our local community and technical college partners. Because many of our prospective students will be working adults, we will also tailor our marketing and recruitment efforts on direct marketing in the local and regional business community. Our cross-campus partnerships will facilitate this outreach. We have included initial marketing costs to launch the program in our financial forecast as well as yearly marketing costs. The initial marketing costs are included in the pro-forma in Year 0. The yearly marketing costs are tied to printing costs. Additionally, the College of Arts and Sciences, as part of our UMKC Forward unit reorganization, will launch a rebranding advertising campaign that will coincide with the launching of the BAS and the BAS will feature prominently in that campaign. The budget for this campaign is $85,000 and includes videography and photography. 3.C.2. Student Success Plan Retention of students is a high priority for UMKC, and we use early warning systems to keep students at the university and on track for graduation. Further, the university has made important changes to encourage retention, including a new centralized advising system and a transfer center dedicated to the unique needs of transfer students like those in our BAS program. As part of UMKC Forward, UMKC is instituting various mobility escalators to help propel students from the classroom to a career. This approach fits squarely with the way we have designed the BAS and will provide further support to the program. Students start the BAS program with a first-semester experience course designed to familiarize BAS students with the many resources UMKC has to offer students, from supplementary instruction to career guidance. This course also provides students with the opportunity to build a learning plan connecting their professional goals to an academic path. For example, a student in the BAS program may be interested in completing the BAS to pursue supervisory or managerial opportunities within their OPEN - ASARED - 2-28 September 2, 2021 chosen field. During the first-semester experience course, the student would be advised to consider the Business and Organizational Leadership emphasis area (non- healthcare fields) or the Healthcare Services Management emphasis area (healthcare fields). The student would be advised to pursue curricular (internships) and co- curricular (volunteer, student organizations, etc.) opportunities in line with this goal and the Director of the BAS will meet with students periodically to reassess their progress toward their learning and professional goals. 3.C.3. Transition Plan The Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences will oversee the selection of the Director of the BAS. The Director of the BAS will be responsible for the in rollout of this new undergraduate program. Should the Director of the BAS leave the role, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences will select a successor and ensure that the new Director has been involved in the program and is familiar with its mission. 3.C.4. Exit Strategy The BAS program does not require a significant investment in faculty or staff and costs are directly tied to enrollment (i.e., adjunct hiring). As a result, the program should be given time to establish itself and determine demand for the program. However, should it become clear that the program is not viable due to low headcount (remaining below the academic viability figure after five years), we can eliminate our adjunct hiring and full-time faculty can return to teaching their BA and BS students alone. The Director of the BAS will be a current faculty member so the Director would resume their normal workload without the stipend. 4. Institutional Capacity The BAS program is designed to utilize existing UMKC teaching resources as much as possible while recognizing resource needs associated with growth. We have identified five emphasis areas that correspond to growth opportunities in our traditional degree programs to capitalize on resource commitments by the university. The Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences will oversee the selection of the Director of the BAS and together they will be responsible for the rollout of the BAS. We have built the BAS in collaboration with faculty and administrators across multiple units and have worked with staff with expertise in transfer students, advising, and recruitment to address hurdles and avoid stumbling blocks. Full-time faculty across many units will be teaching our core and emphasis area courses, as appropriate, and well-qualified and experienced adjunct instructors will provide additional teaching support as needed. OPEN - ASARED - 2-29 September 2, 2021 The Director of the BAS will play a central role in the assessment of the BAS program, the recruitment of students, and advising students throughout their time at UMKC. Given our research, the advising component will be critical. The Director of the BAS will ensure that students start the program with a clear understanding of their academic and professional goals and the means to achieve them (through A&S 311, our first-semester experience course). The Director of the BAS will stay in contact with students as they proceed through their core courses and coordinate with faculty in the emphasis areas as appropriate to assist students. UMKC's central advising team will provide additional support to BAS students as well. To ensure the Director of the BAS can focus substantial attention on student success, we have determined that a part-time and, as the program grows, full-time staff person will be necessary to assist with coordinating the program, addressing administrative needs, and fielding inquiries. The staffing costs are included in the budget (part-time in Years 1-4 and full-time starting in Year 5). 5. Program Characteristics 5.A. Program Outcomes The Bachelor of Applied Science degree program will prepare BAS students to develop professional messages for a variety of audiences. Students will learn to: 1. Deliver professional messages in written and/or oral form. 2. Apply ethical standards to decisions and practical challenges relevant to their field of study. 3. Analyze professional, civic, and social problems in order to design solutions relevant to their field of study. 4. Examine the factors defining cultural identities from multiple perspectives. Given their prior training and education, students may need to complete additional general education requirements focused on critical thinking, math, the Constitution, and written communication. These foundational courses will ensure students have the background to complete their educational and professional goals. Students will also develop expertise in business and organizational leadership, healthcare management, data analytics, digital media, and digital humanities through their chosen emphasis area. All courses included in the emphasis areas serve other degree programs and are assessed yearly. OPEN - ASARED - 2-30 September 2, 2021 5.B. Program Design & Content The curriculum for the BAS was designed as a collaboration among faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences, School of Computer Science and Engineering, School of Nursing and Health Sciences, and the Bloch School of Management with the support of the Vice Provost for Curriculum and Assessment, who advised on the connection to UMKC Essentials and the unique needs of transfer students. The program will be housed in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Director of the BAS will be responsible for coordinating the scheduling of the core courses (pre- existing courses serving other programs) and emphasis area courses. The Director of the BAS will also be responsible for teaching A&S 311 (Experiencing UMKC) as needed each year. We have put together two-year course plans for each emphasis area to ensure students can progress through the degree program in the two-year window set for full-time BAS students. 5.C. Program Structure The BAS will consist of a common core in five broad categories (13 hours), an emphasis area (18-24 hours) with coursework from across UMKC, general education needs (0-21 hours), and any remaining courses needed to meet the 36-hour upper- level requirement and to reach 120 credit hours. Students will work closely with the Director of the BAS to select an emphasis area that best fits their individual professional goals.

Any unique features such as interdepartmental cooperation : This interdisciplinary degree program relies on collaboration between several departments within the College of Arts and Sciences and across academic units at UMKC, including the Bloch School of Management, the School of Computing and Engineering, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences. 5.D. Program Goals and Assessment The BAS program will be assessed primarily through the SLOs of the common core coursework. These are the courses all students graduating with a BAS degree will have completed. Each emphasis area will assess its curriculum and report assessment data to the Director of the BAS for review each year. The Student Learning Outcomes for the BAS include: Develop professional messages for a variety of audiences Deliver professional messages in written and/or oral form Apply ethical standards to decisions and practical challenges relevant to their emphasis area Analyze professional, civic, and social problems in order to design solutions relevant to their emphasis area Examine the factors defining cultural identities from multiple perspectives We will use two types of assessment for the BAS degree. The assessment of student learning for the program will be based on a portfolio of student work. Portfolium in Canvas will be used to gather assessment artifacts and a rubric will be used to assess degree-level SLOs. Artifacts will vary across the different SLOs and will include essays, research papers, policy papers, and other professional products (e.g., professional messages and presentations). Further, students in the BAS will create a learning contract that addresses their goals for the program as part of their first-semester experience course (Experiencing UMKC). With the help of the instructor, they will create a degree map to fit their specific career and professional goals. Using their portfolios, students will do a reflective assessment at the end of their 3rd and 4th years to assess their progress, adjust their goals and reflect on their learning. Upon graduation, our goal for placement of these students is to see them advancing in their pre-BAS career or being employed in fields relevant to their chosen BAS emphasis area. We will assess this placement success with our graduating senior survey and our alumni surveys. Feedback from these surveys will be used to refine the BAS. Our retention rates for full-time transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences is high at 75% (three-year average of 2017-2019) and we anticipate a similar retention rate for full-time students in the BAS. Retention rates for part-time students OPEN - ASARED - 2-38 September 2, 2021 is lower in the College of Arts and Sciences (52% for the three-year average of 2017- 2019). While our enrollment projections incorporate this lower rate, these projections are conservative. We expect our retention rate for BAS students to outpace the average rate for part-time students for two key reasons. First, our curriculum is designed with this population in mind. Our first-semester experience is designed to re-establish study habits for our adult learners, establish learning and professional goals, and provide campus contacts for students if they find themselves struggling. Because we are targeting students with particular professional and learning goals and students who will start our program as juniors, we anticipate greater persistence in the program given their intentional enrollment. 5.E. Student Preparation This interdisciplinary degree is designed for students who have completed an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree. This is a requirement for admission to the program. Our target population are adults with a AAS degree and work experience who would benefit from a Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree for career progression, career change, or personal development. 5.F. Faculty and Administration Our Director of the BAS will be responsible for the execution of this proposal and management of the program. Our financial projections include a stipend and a course reduction to enable them to manage this program. Staff support for the BAS program will be provided by the College of Arts and Sciences. Advising support will be provided by the Director of the BAS and the central advising office at UMKC. The BAS is a unique program in that it largely relies on courses that serve other degree programs. As a result, there are no specific faculty assigned to this program. However, units and departments have committed to ensuring courses are offered and seats are available for BAS students in required core courses and emphasis area requirements (see letters of support). A list of faculty likely to teach courses taken by BAS students is included in the appendix. Faculty will be eligible to teach in the BAS if they meet credentialing requirements set by MDHE for the relevant subject area. The BAS curriculum has been developed according to existing faculty strengths at UMKC. As the program grows, we see the potential for strategic faculty and staff hires to accommodate significant growth. Specifically, we anticipate adjunct faculty needs immediately that evolve into full-time faculty hires as the program expands. Our likeliest area for future growth is in Data Analytics and this is where we expect a hire will be needed, but this faculty member would be hired in one of the departments supporting the emphasis area and expected to contribute to the BAS and relevant degree programs in their home department. OPEN - ASARED - 2-39 September 2, 2021 5.G. Alumni and Employer Survey We value feedback from our alumni and employers. As part of our assessment plan, we survey graduating seniors about the program. We will work with the College of Arts and Sciences Director of Advancement to follow up with alumni post-graduation and track employment opportunities as part of our regular program review process. We will use both methods to gather feedback on program assessment, revision, and growth opportunities. 5.H. Program Accreditation Accreditation is not a requirement for the Bachelor of Applied Science degree program. 6.

An AAS degree is focused on a specific career path and is often technical in nature , which distinguishes its degree holder from the traditional transfer population holding Associate of Science or Associate of Arts degrees . As the proposal notes, the Bachelor of Applied Sciences increases the transferability of coursework that traditionally is not accepted at four- year institut ions (e.g., beverage control). Although the technical training acquired for the AAS can lead directly to employment opportunities for students, the BAS provides additional professional skills (e.g., communication, critical thinking, leadership) to enhance current and future employment opportunities for students pursuing this option. Specifically, the emphases in Health Services Management, Business and Organizational Leadership, Data Analytics, Digital Media, and Digital and Public Humanities can make these students significantly more attractive to employers and improve earning potential for students. The interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the degree program maximized flexibility in course offerings and ensures that courses or emphases are not de pendent on specific faculty. There is very minimal investment needed to launch the program because the coursework is already being offered as part of exis ting programs. As such, there is very little risk involved in launching this program, which notably is unique to the UM System. In summary, the College of Arts and Sciences has planned a robust interdisciplinary degree , the Bachelor of Applied Sciences, that is important to our region and state, and that provides a path to professionalism and broader e mployment opportunities for those with more technical training backgrounds. I am confident that we can deliver this degree, meet student and workforce demand, and strengthen two -year college partnerships in the process. Best regards, Jennifer D. Lundgre n, PhD Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor University of Missouri-Kansas City OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-41 September 2, 2021December 9, 2020 Dr. Vonnahme, Thank you for sharing UMKC's Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree proposal, and please accept this letter as MCC's support of UMKC's new degree plan. What an exciting opportunity for MCC students and an excellent next step in our schools' partnership. The selling points of UMKC's BAS degree plan provide a seamless opportunity for MCC students to build onto their existing associate degree, al lowing students to complete their bachelor's degree in two years or less and gain important professional skills to advance their careers. Especially exciting is the unique design of the UMKC BAS program which targets both students interested in advancing w ithin their chosen career or students seeking a degree completion program. UMKC's combination focus on a common core aimed at broadening students professional and leadership skills (communication, ethics, engagement, and diversity) with emphasis areas in h igh demand fields is a perfect fit for students in technical careers looking to switch career paths without sacrificing the technical credits they have earned. I look forward to building on what has already been a productive and beneficial partnership w ith UMKC and advancing further the opportunities to positively impact our institutions, students, and the communities we serve. Thank you for considering MCC and our students in the development of UMKC'S Bachelor of Applied Science degree plan. Sue Gochis Vice Chancellor of Instruction/CAO Metropolitan Community College OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-42 September 2, 2021May 26, 2021 Beth Vonnahme, Ph.D. Associate Dean, College of Arts and Sciences Associate Professor, Department of Political Science University of Missouri - Kansas City Dear Associate Dean Vonnahme, I am pleased to write this letter of support for the proposed Bachelor of Applied Science you are developing. Th is new degree program presents a unique opportunity to serve a population of students that are currently underserved by our existing degree options . Students with an Associate of Applied Science degree often encounter many hurdles to completing their bachelor's degree. This program will ease this burden and ensure more students with an AAS degree apply to UMKC, matriculate, and graduate within a reasonable period of ti me. I look forward to being able to offer this exciting opportunity for our transfer population , a significant segment of our incoming students. Not only will this program provide a path to degree completion for a frequently overlooked transfer population, but the curriculum will equip students with critical skills identified by employers as most necessary for their employees. As noted in the propo sal, survey after survey documents employers' desire to have employees with critical thinking, problem -solving, ethical judgment, civic, team building, and communication skills. The BAS core curriculum was structured t o hone these skills. The emphasis area s expand the professional development in the context of five in -demand areas: Business and Organizational Leadership, Health Services Management, Data Analytics, Digital Media, and Digital and Public Humanities. The BAS was built by a multi -disciplinary team choosing the best set of existing courses to sharpen these critical skills and prepare students for careers in their chosen emphasis area. As such, this is a cost - effective degree program and the addition of new courses can be accommodated within exis ting workloads and by part-time instructors. I commend you for the heavy lift and intricate curriculum coordination to make this degree possible. I am excited to provide this unique opportunity to students who otherwise would not be likely to enroll at the un iversity. Sincerely, Kati Toivanen Interim Dean UMKC College of Arts & Sciences OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-43 September 2, 202127 April 2021 Beth Vonnahme , Ph.D. Associate Dean, College of Arts and Sciences Associate Professor, Department of Political Science University of Missouri - Kansas City Dear Professor Vonnahme : I am writing in support of the proposed Business and Organizational Leadership emphasis area within the proposed Bachelor of Applied Sciences (BAS) , developed by the UMKC College of Arts and Sciences . We view the Business and Organizational Leadership emphasis area as providing compliment ary skill development for BAS students. A recent employer survey noted that the ability to work effectively in teams, critical thinking skills, and the ability to analyze and interpret data as being critically important for college graduates. Developing t hese skillsets feature prominently in Bloch's curriculum, and will improve the competitiveness of BAS graduates in the Kansas City labor market. BAS students with a Business and Organizational Leadership empha sis area will also be able to utilize the Bloch Career Center, creating additional opportunities for these students to pursue an internship with a Kansas City employer. I also wanted to address the question of financial support from Bloch for the proposed emphasis area . As you know, we structured the emphasis area to closely mirror the existing Minor in Business Administration in the Bloch School. This structure maximizes cost efficiency for Bloch \u2014at this point, our prop osal requires no new courses and based on current enrollment projections no new sections for existing courses . If, however, the program grows beyond the proposal projections, we may need to add new sections and potentially new faculty, consistent with the UMKC budget model. Please do not hesitate to let me know if I can provide anything further and thank you r leadership in the development process. Sincerely, Brian S. Anderson , Ph.D. Executive Associate Dean & Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-44 September 2, 2021June 1, 2021 Beth Vonna hme, Ph.D. Associate Dean, College of Arts and Sciences Associate Professor, Department of Political Science University of Missouri - Kansas City Dear Profess or Vonnahme, I am pleased to write this letter of support for the proposed Health Service Management emphasis area within the proposed Bachelor of Applied Sciences (BAS) degree program recently developed by the UMKC College of Arts and Sciences. We view th e Health Services Management track as an option for students to broaden their leadership skills to join the current booming health services workforce. The BAS students in this track will also complete several career exploration options with agencies and organizations in the KC metro area. I also wanted to address the question of financial support from SoNHS for the proposed emphasis area. We have structured this emphasis area using courses that are regularly offered in the BHS program. This structure maximizes cost efficiency for SoNHS\u2014at this point, our proposal requires no new courses and based on current enrollment projections no new sections for existing courses. If in the future there is rapid growth in course enrollment, we may need to add new course sections, but that could be done in a budget -effective way. I look forward to w atching this program and our minor develop and grow. Sincerely, Joy Rober ts, JD, MSN, APRN- BC Interim Dean OPEN -- -- 2-45 September 2, 2021OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-46 September 2, 2021Dear to Whom It May Concern: We are writing to enthusiastically support the degree program proposal of the Bachelor of Applied Science. Specially, we want to express our full commitment and support to the Digital Media Emphasis that is closely related to our departments. The Digital Media Emphasis is important to local and regional employers since there is an increasing demand of such skills with a science background to contribute to the region's digital media industry. According to a report by the Kansas City Business Journal, Kansas City is the home to many top international, national, and regional digital marketing firms, such as VMLY&R and Intouch Group. The digital marketing industry becomes increasing ly data-driven in recent years. As a thriving industry, their demand of graduat es specialized in Digital Media with a science background highlights the importance of the proposed BAS degree programs. Among our students, there is also a growing need for multi-media and digital media education that can prepare them for jobs in the digital media industry. Many internship opportunities are seeking students with skills in social media, online streaming, video production, and digital advertising. All of these are strong evidence that the proposed BAS degree program will serve the local communities and our students very well. As the Chairs of the Department Art and Art History and the Department of Communication Studies, we feel excited about this new degree program and the value it will bring to UMKC and the region. Ye Wang Elijah Gowin Associate Professor Professor Interim Chair Chair Department of Communication Studies Department of Art and Art History University of Missouri-Kansas City University of Missouri-Kansas City OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-47 September 2, 2021 19 May 2021 Elizabeth Vonnahme Associate Dean College of Arts & Sciences University of Missouri- Kansas City Dear Associate Dean Vonnahme , We are eager to partner with the College of Arts & Sciences in the development of a Bachelor of Applied Sciences with an emphasis in Digital and Public Humanities. As you are aware, we are a collaborative, multi - disciplinary group of faculty who offer cour ses that train students in the creative application of data science and digital tools to texts, archives, and visual materials. These Digital and Public Humanities courses have been integrated into the university's general education program, undergraduate research program, special collections and archives programming, undergraduate research program, and many majors. In addition, we have two important new resources/spaces that support research and teaching agendas in Digital and Public Humanities: the Digita l Collaboration Studio in Miller Nichols Library, which will be dedicated to experiential research discovery and collaboration, and the Plaster Free Enterprise Center in the School of Computing and Engineering, which has experiential teaching, learning, and research space for interdisciplinary collaborations. UMKC's momentum in providing infrastructure to support state-of- the-art pedagogical engagement through which to train students to address twenty- first century challenges means it is time to develop a c oherent pedagogical program in Digital Humanities. We are uniquely positioned to serve as Kansas City's leading humanities program, empowering scholars at UMKC and in the region to discover, explore, experiment, and develop critical research skills that advance humanity. The Digital and Public Humanities curriculum and research plans align with UMKC's strategic plan and the UMKC Forward initiatives. To begin, Digital Humanities include the application of data science methodologies to problems in the humanities while also engaging with broad public audiences using digital methods and media. Public humanities are broader. It includes digital humanities, but also emphasizes collaborative community engagement and outreach through public exhibitions and pr ogramming. Our mission is to engage students, faculty, and the community in using digital technologies and data research methods to enrich the public's understanding of humanity and to promote solutions that improve the quality of life for citizens of the Kansas City region. We would like to outline here some of the key reasons that that this emphasis area is a critical area of growth. As researchers and educators, we have had considerable momentum over the past ten years. The following numbers are low estimates, restricted to the funding received by the English and History Department as well as the University Libraries grants and gifts that support the Humanities (we are aware other faculty have been offering courses that will contribute to the new curricu lum as we move forward) . University Libraries supports the entire academic enterprise and has not only had major success in raising funds for facilities, but also funds for public programming, exhibits, and digital access and preservation projects. $4,802,000 Community Gifts and Partnerships for Digital and Public Humanities $3,164,009 External Grant Funding for Digital Humanities Projects $1,569,961 External Grant Funding for Public Humanities Projects $294,685 Tuition 2018-2020: $294,685 (undergraduate and graduate) $377,300 Paid Internships in Public History (stipend and tuition) 2014-2020 OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-48 September 2, 2021Our numbers to date illustrate strong faculty engagement and success, as well as strong student interest in these courses. With a coherent curriculum and advertising, we anticipate student enrollment increases of at least 5% each year over the first five years after the program launches. Through the K -12 initiatives in teacher training the Department of History has developed, we anticipate a pipeline of students from high school to UMKC. The real -world job training offered through the paid internship program in Public History has drawn students from the region and beyond to UMKC. We also know that on-the-job training provided by participation in extern ally funded grant projects will give undergraduates and graduate students the multidisciplinary skills they need to compete in the job force (from computing and coding to public exhibitions and open- access story -telling, from data processing and metadata m anagement to collaboration and project management. Developing this curriculum will mean that we can bring our research into our teaching and allow the successes of student learning to help develop our research projects going forward. We believe that the Bachelor of Applied Sciences can be an integral piece in the implementation of UMKC Forward. The degree will prepare our students to succeed in the 21 st-century workforce, it will provide new interdisciplinary research opportunities, and ultimately activel y engage and collaborate with community stakeholders to build a better Kansas City. We look forward to participating in the Bachelor of Applied Sciences and helping students realize their full potential as experiential learners.

Over the course of eight months a team of faculty, staff, and administrators have worked to create a program of study that meets indus try needs and dovetails with current strengths at UMKC. Students will be able to study with faculty experts that range in expertise from Computer Science, Management, to Mathematics and Statistics. As Coordinator of the Data Science initiative at UMKC, I have been able to spend a significant amount of time with industry leaders in our region. I have learned that they are starved for data science talent, and particularly for employees able to start as entering professionals with the b asic skills to then effectively learn on the job. With this intuition, the BAS in Data Analytics leverages hands-on learning so that graduates are positioned to be successful from the very start of their employment. Given the vigorous demand for data scien ce professionals and high entering salaries in this field, our faculty team knows that the BAS in Data Analytics will be valuable for our students and the university as a whole. Sincerely, Brent Never, Ph.D. Coordinator, Institute of Data Education, Analytics and Science OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-51 September 2, 2021 May 21, 2021 To Whom It May Concern - I am writing to enthusiastically support the creation of the Bachelor of Applie d Science degree program (BAS) at the University of Missouri -Kansas City. As Manager of Recruitment and Outreach for the UMKC College of Arts and Sciences, I work closel y with prospective transfer students, community college advisors , and faculty to facilitate referral to the Colle ge, with a focus on metro area partners such as MCC, JCCC, and KCKCC. Having the BAS as a degree option would pr ovide an invaluable recruitment tool as well as the ability to meet the ever -changing dem ands of our prospective transfe r students. The primary benefit of this program is the ability to maximize transfer credits previously taken as part of an Associate 's of Applied Science. When worki ng with our transfer prospects, I have observed the number one concern of students to be the transferability of prior credits, often as a means to save time and money while working towards a Bachelor's degree. Being able to promote the AA S to BAS route would allow UMKC to become more competitive with o ur peers , while striving to become a true destination for metro area transfer students. In our current regional recruitment landscape , UMKC faces increasing competition for transfer students amongst four-year peers as community college graduation rates have declined over recent years. The BAS would be instrumental in helping to raise the profile of UMKC to both stude nts and community stakeholders alike. I am hopeful and excited about the prospect of being able to personally utilize the B AS degree as an impactful recruitm ent tool in my future outreach to transfer students and our community college partners. Please accept this letter as my strongest endorsement of the creation of the BAS degree program at UMKC. Sincerely, Emma Casey, M.M.

I have unwavering support for this potential new program. From my perspective, it presents an equitable path for vulnerable students laced with transferable skills to every industry and profession. This degree program is versatile making it something, I can image, local organizations getting behind as we continue to work to battle worker shortages. Please let me know if there is a way to partner when it comes to the healthcare area. KAMERA MEANEY, MA, MBA Director of Nursing Administrative Services, Nursing Administration (816) 404-5218 | kamera.meaney@tmcmed.org From: English, Karen K. < Wednesday, >; Wheeler, Elizabeth < wheelerei@umkcfoundation.org > Subject: The College of Arts and Sciences Alumni Feedback Requested on Behalf of Associate Dean Dr. Beth Vonnahme Good afternoon. Over the last year, I have been developing a new degree program for the College of Arts and Sciences (and the new SACSS) called the Bachelor of Applied Science. This innovative degree targets students with an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree. An AAS degree is focused on a specific career path, which distinguishes its degree holder from the traditional transfer population holding Associate of Science or Associate of Arts degrees. At present, AAS degree holders do not have an easy path to degree completion within the UM System because much of their coursework is technical or career specific. In fact, the data we collected shows these students matriculate at significantly lower rates and take longer when they do matriculate than their AA and AS counterparts. This population is not well-served by the current degree options within the UM System. The BAS seeks to ease the transition of AAS students from their two-year technical degree to a bachelor's degree and thus serve a new population of students. The curriculum combines in-demand skills like critical thinking, communication, ethics, teamwork, and complex problem-solving skills with expertise development in business and organizational leadership, health services management, data analytics, digital media, and digital humanities. While housed in the College of Arts and Sciences (soon to be School of Arts, Culture, and Social Sciences), the BAS program is a collaborative effort with three additional units at UMKC\u2014the Bloch School of Management, the School of Computing and Engineering, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences\u2014with further collaborations with other units possible. Working with these collaborators across campus, we have developed the curriculum and the key courses serving the BAS core and the five emphasis areas. I have attached a brief presentation that I prepared for our meeting. I would love your feedback/support for this degree program. I believe it provides a unique opportunity for an underserved population of students and provides a clear path to growing the College/School. Thank you!

I always look forward to seeing you on the Alumni Board monthly Zoom meetings! I'm just reaching out to express my support for the BAS degree program based on your proposal shared with the Alumni Board. It sounds like a great plan to expand the College's curriculum and serve a growing sector of the job market (health care management/administration). I'm toying with the idea of eventually transitioning from litigation to working as in-house counsel for a large hospitalchain (far, far, far down my career road, of course) because the more I learn about the legal aspectsof healthcare administration, the more interesting they sound. A BAS would have been a great option for me when I was in college, and I'd love to see the opportunity given to future students.

OPEN -- ASARED -- 2-56 September 2, 2021OPEN -- -- 2-57 2, -- 2-58 2, -- 2, 2021July 12, 2021 Beth Vonnahme, Ph.D. Associate Dean, College of Arts and Sciences University of Missouri - Kansas City Dear Associate Dean Vonnahme, Thank you for bringing the proposed Bachelor of Applied Science degree program offered at the UMKC to my attention. As an employer in Kansas City, I am pleased to learn that graduates of this program will be prepared to enter career fields such as Business and Organizational Leadership, Digital Media, and Digital Human ities. A program such as this would enable career advancement in technical industries in our region, particularly in management and supervisory roles which, as you know, usually require a bachelor's degree or higher. A degree program designed to create a bachelor's degree path for students who may not otherwise return to college will be very well received by both students and employers. Students with AAS degrees are likely to have worked for years in technical fields, and they will bring diverse experien ces and technical expertise to the classroom. A BAS program would then equip them with communication, leadership, and critical thinking which would be applicable to all careers and for further specialized training in key growth fields. I look forward to t he development of this degree program and evaluating BAS graduates in our applicant pools. Regards, Jon F.
