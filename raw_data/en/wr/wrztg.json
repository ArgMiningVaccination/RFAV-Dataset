A book reception for Jack, one of the founders of our premier Department of Computer Science, recognized his selfless work on behalf of fellow scientists. A n uclear physicist during the Cold War in the former Soviet Union, Distinguished University Professor of Physics Roald Sagdeev was a top advisor to Mikhail Gorbachev. A symposium and birthday celebration for him included discussions of space and plasma physics and international relations. A c onference titled \" An Open World of Physics\" recognized the research career and birthday of Sankar Das Sarma, the Richard E. Prange Chair and a Distinguished University Professor in Physics. The speakers included three Nobel Laureates. The D epartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry held a reunion/symposium to honor Professor and Chair Mike Doyle for his birthday. Many of Mike's former and current students and co-workers turned out for the special event. The fe arless ideas generated by all of our faculty members, staff and students are making an impact across campus and around the world. University of Maryland President Wallace Loh champions this innovative and entrepreneurial spirit. In this issue, we are pleased to share examples of how that spirit is driving research and discovery within the college.

'66, chemistry, has helped create that future for the industry. Green T echnology Solutions M arks, the Vladimir N. Ipatieff Professor of Catalytic Chemistry and Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at North-western University, is a world leader in devel-oping new catalysts to help create recyclable, environmentally friendly, and sustainably produced plastics and elastomeric materials. Catalysts accelerate the creation of molecules or materials without being consumed and have wide-ranging applications, including the activation of enzymes in biology, the synthesis of therapeutic drugs and the large-scale production of coatings, fertilizers and plastics. M arks's research has helped scientists understand the requirements to make and break specific chemical bonds and design new catalytic processes that have led directly to multi-billion dollar industrial innovations. He also has demonstrated how metals from unusual parts of the periodic table, such as rare earth elements, can be used as efficient catalysts with fewer undesired by-products. His work has resulted in enormous savings in energy and scarce resources and will play a major role in new technologies such as solar cells made from plastic and printing processes to make transistors and other electronic devices. \" The coming decades will present man- kind with technical challenges threatening our quality of life,\" says Marks. \"I believe that chemistry offers defining concepts and tools, and hence limitless opportunities, to better human life in many ways. \"tobin m arks presents \" p lasti C s olar Cells with engineered interfa C es\" at the College's 20 12 home Coming al umni festival. m arks was indu C ted into the C mns Cir C le of d is Co very and re C eived the 2012 distinguished C hemistry alumni award. The 2011 Dr eyfus Prize in the Chemical Sciences winner was honored for developing new industrial catalysts and broadening the understanding of their chemical structures and how they work. The $250,000 award, given by the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, recognizes exceptional and original research in a selected area of chemistry that has advanced the field in major ways. M arks received his Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of T echnology. He has been on the Northwestern faculty since 1970, and his research accom-plishments have been recognized worldwide, including the U.S. National Medal of Science and election to the National Academy of Sciences, membership in the National Academy of Engineering, and numerous awards from the American Chemical Society and many international organizations. He is on the editorial boards of nine major journals; consultant or advisor for six major corpora-tions and start-ups; and has published 1,075 research articles and holds 215 U.S. patents. Marks is also a member of the University of Maryland Alumni Association Hall of Fame. A Transformative Experience \" When I attended summer orientation my freshman year, it was the first time I stepped foot on a college campus,\" remembers Marks, who is a first-generation college graduate. Marks lived on campus in Damascus Hall, a converted Army barracks, for one year before commuting to the university for the remaining three years. \"I remember driving through blizzards on University Boulevard going back and forth from school,\" recalls Marks. \"I made many friends at College Park, it was an enjoyable time. \" H e also remembers working his way through school starting at the university's Poultry Research Center on campus. \"I fed chickens on Sunday afternoons,\" recounts Marks. \"My job in the chemistry department was much more enjoyable. \" Thr ough the years, Marks has tracked down a few classmates and kept up with departmental updates on alumni. \"I have looked at yearbooks online, and it is good to see the campus evolving,\" he notes. A s a college professor, he now under- stands, \" A good undergraduate education is transformative, you are such a different person when you leave the institution. I did not truly appreciate the transformative experience I had at Maryland. \" H e judges his career success by \"how many students I have helped and how my discoveries have made the world a better place. There is a real satisfaction in seeing your students grow and succeed, but my first passion is discovering new and useful things. \" nT obin Marks Discovers Catalysts to Create Sustainably Produced Plastics Chemistry Grad Recognized for Industry-changing Innovations Photo by Thai Nguyen odyS S ey m ay 2013 3CMNS researchers are on a mission. Throughout the college, nearly 1,000 research and tenure-track faculty members, along with their students, are seeking answers to many of science's fundamental questions. \"Our dedicated researchers are on the edge of discovery in the never-ending quest for informa-tion to add to their discipline's body of knowledge and unlock some of science's biggest mysteries,\" says CMNS Dean Jayanth Banavar. Th at relentless pursuit of scientific breakthroughs is made possible, in part, by the generous support of a host of federal and corporate partners, who last year alone invested more than $180 million in the college. That investment has yielded strong returns. On the p ages that follow, read more about the big questions CMNS researchers are tackling and the answers they are discovering.

While it may be winter break 2012 in College Park, it is summer at the South Pole and prime time for construction on Hoffman's latest experiment. Donning a hard hat, Hoffman helps the crew drill 200 meters into the Antarctic ice to install a unique subsurface telescope covering nearly 100 square kilometers that can detect some of the tiniest particles in our universe\u2014neutrinos. \"N eutrinos are basic building blocks of our universe,\" says Hoffman. By exploring their properties, she believes, we can learn more about the nature of galaxies and super-novae and unravel astrophysical phenomena occurring millions or even billions of light years away. N eutral and nearly massless, neutrinos move at light speed and are difficult to detect. They travel from space in straight lines with-out interacting with anything. In fact, billions of them pass through our bodies unnoticed every second. Thr ough her work on two NSF-funded projects, Hoffman is expanding our under-standing of these tiny particles, which could also tell us more about cosmic rays, high- energy protons that bombard Earth, some having more kinetic energy than a profes-sional baseball pitch. Hoffman notes: \"The question is: what could accelerate them to such high energies?\" T racking cosmic rays to find this celestial particle accelerator is elusive because the magnetic field along their path bends the electrically charged particles. But neutrinos offer a clue. J ust as Galileo's optical telescope opened a new lens on space exploration, so do neutrino telescopes. \"Galileo studied the heavens by looking at light or photons,\" notes Hoffman. \"T oday we can gather different information about the skies by looking for neutrinos. \" H offman leads the development of the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), a neutrino What do tiny neutrinos reveal about the universe? telescope that uses radio frequency, which transmits best through very cold ice, to detect the particles. Plans are underway for 37 subsurface clusters of radio antennae. In addition, she is a major contributor to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, completed in 2010, which detects neutrinos inside a cubic kilometer block of ice at the South Pole. \" Whatever produces cosmic rays should also be producing neutrinos,\" says Hoffman. T raveling in straight lines, their origins are easier to discern. \"If we can find some area of the sky where the neutrinos cluster\u2014a twinkling spot of neutrinos\u2014then we can figure out what is accelerating matter to such high energies,\" says Hoffman. n Billions of neutrinos pass through our B odies unnoticed every second. kara h offman helps with the Cons tru C tion of the ara neutrino dete C tor lo C ated near the s outh p ole.1 Neutrino event reconstruction by IceCube Neutrino Observatory / Hoffman photo by Melany Zimmerman odyS S ey m ay 2013 5Was Einstein correct? Current data supports Einstein's theory, but most scientists predict there is a glitch somewhere. \"There's a disconnec- tion between the two major pillars of physics \u2014general relativity and quantum mechanics. They make fundamentally different assumptions,\" says Reynolds, whose research is funded by NASA. \"Most physicists think Einstein's theory has to give. \" The s earch for answers is limited by current technology, which collects X-ray light from only a relatively small area and \"does not allow us to track changes in the X-ray spectrum of accreting black holes in order to truly test Einstein's assumptions,\" says Reynolds, who is optimistic that future observatories will shed more light on the mysteries of black holes. He serves as a science advisor for the European Space Agency's proposed Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT), which is now being considered for construction with a tentative launch around 2020. \"With a collection area that's nearly 100 times larger than current observatories, LOFT would enable us to study changes in the spectra of black hole systems in exquisite detail,\" says Reynolds, \"allowing us to conduct new tests of gravity and further our knowledge of how matter interacts with the black hole during its final 'death plunge. '\" nBlack holes may hold the answer to one of science's biggest questions: Does Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity hold true? \"Black holes are places where gravity has gone crazy,\" says Astronomy Pro-fessor Christopher Reynolds, director of the college's Joint Space Science Institute, a partner-ship with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. \"They have the strongest gravitational fields in the universe. They suck in everything, even light. \" Those properties make them the perfect natural laboratory to study Einstein's predictions about gravity. W hile black holes themselves are undetectable, the super-hot gases spiraling into them emit radiation that can be detected by X-ray telescopes. Reynolds seeks a better understanding of black hole dynamics by examining data from instruments like NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) that must remain in orbit thousands of miles into space to capture the X-rays. \" According to Einstein, space is like a rubber sheet that can bend,\" says Reynolds. \"Black holes can twist the space around them. \" Using the X-ray telescope observations, Reynolds can calculate how quickly a black hole is rotating and begin to examine this \"twisting of space. \" 2 Illustration by Loretta Kuo 6 o dyS S ey m ay 2013Deadly pathogens infecting human cells are all in a day's work for Associate Professor Najib El-Sayed in the Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics and the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS). Under carefully controlled conditions in his campus laboratory, El-Sayed grows three related trypanosomatid parasites that afflict an estimated 20 million people worldwide, causing diseases that run rampant in the developing world, including African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease. Thr ough his research, El-Sayed exposes these parasites to human cells grown in the laboratory and examines what happens on a genomic level. \"We're looking to see how the parasite adapts to the host and how it inter - feres with the host's defense mechanisms,\" says El-Sayed, whose research is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. \"Ultimately, our goal is to help scientists develop drug targets or vaccines. \"How can deadly pathogens be controlled? these parasites affect some 20 million people worldwide. A s an undergraduate biology student, El-Sayed was fascinated by parasites. \"They have complex, amazing lifecycles that take them from one host to another with incredible ways of modulating the function of every host and changing it to optimize their survival,\" he notes. That's great for parasites, but it could be lethal for host sites, including humans. T oday, El-Sayed's research utilizes next- generation sequencing technology to follow every single one of a parasite's 10,000 genes and examine how each gene behaves during the infection process. Likewise, he studies how the host cell responds. \"We're trying to understand their gene expression programs, which genes turn on and off,\" he explains. I n a major breakthrough, the team recently identified a subset of genes in the Chagas disease-causing Trypanosoma cruzi parasite that activates when the pathogen is about to enter the human cell. \"That finding tells us these genes must be involved in the infection process,\" says El-Sayed. Further research indicated that the products of a subset of these genes, the Mucin-Associated Surface Proteins (MASP), play key roles in the infection process. U sing bioinformatics tools, the researchers then identified a set of proteins in the human host that interacts with MASP . \"We theorized that if we could stop that interaction, we could reduce the infection rate of Chagas disease,\" explains El-Sayed. Spread by the bite of triato-mine (kissing) bugs, Chagas disease is a major health problem in South and Central America. Left untreated, about 30 percent of infected individuals develop chronic symptoms, including potentially fatal digestive and heart problems. B ack in the lab, El-Sayed's team has successfully prevented human cells from expressing the pinpointed proteins. \"Suddenly the infection rate was reduced dramatically,\" says El-Sayed, who hopes his work leads to new treatments for a number of life-threatening diseases. \"More than one-fifth of the world's population live in areas inhabited by the insects that transmit these parasites,\" says El-Sayed. \"There's a pressing need to find drugs and vaccines for these neglected diseases. \" n 3 96 hours post-infection12 0 hours post-infection Photos by Jungmin Choihuman Cells 96 and 120 hours after infe Ction with the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, whi C h C auses Chagas disease, express a tagged form of the m u C in-as so C iated s urfa C e p roteins masp ), key players in the infe C tion pro C ess. dna in both human C ells and parasites is stained blue. odyS S ey m ay 2013 7For seven years, researchers from Biology Professor William Fagan's lab have traveled the frigid Antarctic seas to study how environmental changes affect penguin populations. When their touring vessels stop along the Antarctic Peninsula, the researchers disembark to painstakingly count each penguin and examine their breeding, nesting and feeding patterns. Using statistical and spatial analysis, Fagan's team has concluded that climate change is upsetting long-entrenched penguin dynamics, causing the population of two breeds to dwindle, while a third increases. F agan's work meshes field research with theoretical models to study the movement and distribution of animal populations from penguins in Antarctica to gazelles in Mongolia and primates in Panama. The findings help address critical questions in ecology and conservation biology. \"T o understand the human impact on other species,\" says Fagan, \"we first have to understand how these species use their habitats. \" With NSF funding, Fagan is developing a suite of bioinformatics tools to better analyze the movements of animal populations. \"There is no one-size-fits-all tool because the data sets can differ greatly,\" notes Fagan, who is applying the tools to three different case studies: blacktip sharks swimming off Florida's coast, whooping cranes migrating from Wisconsin to Florida and nomadic gazelles traveling up to 1,000 kilometers per year across Mongolian grasslands. The g azelle study builds off an earlier collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution that tracked the animals adorned with GPS-enabled collars, motion-detecting sensors and satellite uplinks. \"Basically, you sit back and wait for the animal to send you an e-mail telling you what it has been up to,\" says Fagan. The result is a long record of movement data, no matter where the animal travels\u2014quite different than the other two data sets. The sh arks are embedded with radio frequency identification tags, which allow them to be tracked via triangulation as they swim through a fixed area. Data collection on the whooping cranes depends on the efforts of government scientists and birdwatchers across the country who identify individual birds by unique tags. The t ools should help ecologists better understand what drives the movement patterns of a specific population\u2014be it social dynamics, territo-riality, the prevalence of predators or the search for resources\u2014and assist them in developing appropriate conservation measures. In the case of the Mongolian gazelles, effective conservation efforts will need to consider the gazelle's nomadic nature, driven by its search for food across highly variable grasslands, says Fagan, who also is associate director of research innovation at SESYNC, the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center in Annapolis, a multidisciplinary, five-year, NSF-funded university initiative. n What drives the movement of animal populations?4 Visualization by AMV (Animal Movement Visualizer), Kavathekar, D., et al. / Gazelle photo by Thomas Mueller 8 o dyS S ey m ay 2013What do a fruit fly and a mouse have in common? More than you might think, says Entomology Professor Leslie Pick, who studies the regulatory genes that control embryo development. In the 1990s, Pick's lab created transgenic fruit flies by inserting a mouse regulatory gene into a fly genome. Using genetic tools, the researchers then expressed the mouse gene in place of the analogous fly gene. \"We were amazed that the mouse gene performed a job necessary for the fly's development,\" says Pick. \"We would have thought that the genes for developing a fly\u2014with its cuticle, wings and six legs\u2014would be completely different than those for a mouse. \" P ick's experiment and others have changed the way biologists think and led to the launch of a new field called evolutionary developmental biology, or simply \"evo-devo. \" The field explores two of nature's biggest wonders: the development of complex organisms from single-cell embryos and the astonishing diversity of these organisms. P ick investigates how regulatory genes evolve to allow for this diversity. Encased in a single-celled embryo, regulatory genes act like a set of developmental instructions, controlling the expression of other genes and the cell- differentiation process. Particularly intriguing How do genes change functions in nature? is the fact that many of the same regulatory genes appear in very different species. P ick tracks the evolution of the ftz gene, pronounced \"futz. \" \"This gene seems to have changed more than some other regulatory genes and now regulates totally different genes than its ancestral form,\" explains Pick, who conducts the research with NSF funding. \"In the fruit fly it regulates segment formation, but in other species it plays a different role. The gene has switched its function somewhere during evolution. \" M ysteries abound about this process. \"If we made these types of mutations in the lab, the embryo would die,\" says Pick. The question remains: How could the genes change in nature without damaging the embryo? Pick predicts: \"We will find that evolution works by changing the expression and function of regulatory genes, little bits at a time, that allow the animals to survive and thrive in the wild. \" P ick is serving as a rotating program director on evo-devo at NSF until June, while still maintaining her CMNS research projects. \"It's been a great opportunity to view the field from a higher level and see how my research fits into the bigger picture. \" n\"if we made these types of mutations in the la B , the em B ryo would die.\"5 Illustration by Loretta Kuo odyS S ey m ay 2013 9When Chemistry Professor Amy Mullin's research on high energy molecules reached an impasse, she did what great scientists have done throughout the ages\u2014developed her own instrumentation to help her seek answers. For years, chemists have investigated how energy flows between molecules, hoping to gain insights into how chemical reactions work, but one type of molecular energy\u2014rotation\u2014has remained elusive. Until Mullin developed a high power optical centrifuge, no tool existed to move enough molecules into the extreme states required for study. Understanding these high-energy molecules could have far-reaching insights into plasma and combustion processes. The opt ical centrifuge works by using a special combination of ultrafast laser pulses \u2014called oppositely chirped pulses\u2014to spin molecules into extreme rotational states. \"It mimics molecules found under extreme temperature conditions in nature\u2014several thousand degrees Kelvin,\" explains Mullin. \"But unlike nature, the centrifuge gets the molecules rotating uniformly in space similar to many tiny, spinning gyroscopes. This gives us the potential to control the direction of reactive molecules. \" The ex periment fills an entire laboratory with its series of contraptions and mechanisms \u2014oscillators, amplifiers, lenses and mirrors\u2014covering three connected tables, encompassing 150 square feet. The centrifuge itself covers How does energy flow between fast-spinning molecules? 6 the first two tables; the final third contains the instrumentation for high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. \"The spectroscopy allows us to study how the rotational energy is redistributed into other forms of energy through collisions,\" says Mullin. M ullin joined CMNS in 2005 from Boston University with the dream of building this revolutionary tool. Despite naysayers in the scientific community, Mullin designed, built and began operating the centrifuge in four years. The working instrumentation wowed NSF, which granted Mullin funding to continue the project. H er research is just beginning to yield insights into the dynamics at play in these molecules. \"What's surprising,\" says Mullin, \"is that once we get the molecules spinning, the spin persists even after several thousand collisions. Then it goes into translational energy. \" With varied molecular compounds behaving somewhat differently, Mullin's graduate and undergraduate student team members have their work cut out for them. \"We have to take a lot of measurements to sort out the general from the specific,\" says Mullin. \"But we have already sparked the imagination of many chemists and physicists by showing that we can put these molecules into extreme states. \" nmullin's team w orks with spinning n2o mole hotos from pre C ision opti C s re Combine opti C al C entrifuge pulses. t he green light amplifies the power of the pulses. t he extreme rotational states of n2o are Created and probed in a low pressure Cell.

Illustrations by Galileo NamataIt's been said that you can learn a lot about someone by the company they keep. Computer Science and UMIACS Associate Professor Lise Getoor is tapping into the abundance of data-rich networks and using computers to understand and ana-lyze that relational information and how it can be applied. For example, biologists can infer a protein's cellular function by examining its relationships in a protein-to-protein interaction network. Marketers can predict whether someone will buy a product based on whether their friends have bought it. And political scientists can infer a person's views by analyzing membership in online groups. The b iggest challenge: Data sets are frequently jumbled, redundant and filled with noise that must be filtered. In 2000, Getoor's doctoral research launched a new area of artificial intelligence called \"statistical relational machine learning,\" which combines statistical approaches with relational machine learning strategies to make sense out of messy data sets. T oday, her research is funded by a range of government agencies, including NSF and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and technology giants Google, Microsoft and Yahoo! A nother common problem: inconsistencies in data sets. \"How do you figure out whether two similar references refer to the same entity?\" Getoor poses. For example, in bibliographic information, do J. Smith, Jonathan Smith and John Smith all refer to the same person? Getoor has developed \"entity resolution\" strategies that tackle this problem by examining relational information. If J. Smith and Jonathan Smith have several co-authors in common, they more likely are the same entity. Getoor and her students have developed new algorithms that make use of relational information and other contextual information to improve the accuracy of entity resolution. With fellow researchers at the university's Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory, Getoor developed D-Dupe, a tool for eliminating data duplication that is available as open- source software. A mong Getoor's crowning achievements is a data-cleaning approach called graph identifica- tion that combines three techniques: 1) entity resolution, which weeds out duplicate informa - tion, 2) collective classification, where nodes are identified and labeled based on their relationship with other nodes in the network and 3) link prediction, in which the model predicts relation- ships between data. \" This is the first time that these strategies have been integrated,\" says Getoor. \"The result is an improved model that ensures that you have more accurate information. \" Getoor plans to apply her algorithms to specific areas, including personalized medicine in which extensive data sets can be used to tailor medical treatment to each patient's individual characteristics. n odyS S ey m ay 2013 11Distinguished University Professor and Geology Department Chair Roberta Rudnick is trying to crack a mystery that lies far beneath the ground we walk on. Rudnick studies the evolution of the Earth's continental crust. \"Interestingly, none of the other planets in our solar system have continents,\" she points out. \"Understanding continent formation can broaden our knowledge about many processes on Earth, including our own species' evolution. \" Ge ologists agree that the continental crust formed when magma melted in the Earth's mantle, erupting to the surface. \"The perplexing thing is that the continental crust is comprised of rocks that could not have come directly from the Earth's mantle,\" says Rudnick, \"so other processes must have been involved. \" The crust has an andesitic bulk composition, while geologists would expect it to have a basaltic composition, like the Earth's oceanic crust and terrestrial areas on Mars and Venus. This \"Crust Composition Conundrum\" puzzles Rudnick, and she has traveled the globe for answers. H er research currently takes her to East- ern China, where she looks for clues in rock samples brought to the surface through vol- canic eruptions\u2014what Rudnick calls a poor man's drill hole. \"We would love to drill down and collect samples, but it's hugely expensive, and is not feasible past 12 kilometers,\" says Why do continents exist only on planet Earth? roberta rudni Ck examines and labels mantle xenoliths with gradu ate student Jingao l iu at yang yuan, s hanxi p rovin C e, China. Rudnick, who explains that the base of the crust is 40 kilometers deep and the underly- ing lithosphere is 150 kilometers below the Earth's surface. B ack in the campus geochemical laboratories, her research team has analyzed the samples extensively, finding evidence to explain the conundrum. One theory, called \"recycling of the lower crust,\" posits that millions of years ago the crust was basaltic, but that over time the denser minerals, containing iron and magnesium, accumulated in the lower crust and eventually sank into the mantle. Her lab also unearthed evidence that chemical weathering has changed the crust composition over the ages by removing soluble elements, such as magnesium. R udnick, an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, is also reassessing the continental crust composition to derive a better estimate of its radioactive elements. In the past year, she and her collab- orators have traveled to Central China, South Africa, Namibia, Canada, as well as Idaho and Wyoming, to collect samples from glacial tillites\u2014rock material deposited during ice ages throughout history. The information could help uncover further mysteries of continent evolution, including how weather- ing of continents responded to the rise of atmospheric oxygen some 2.4 billion years ago. n8 Inset photo by Richard J.

The mathematics professor applies her expertise in nonlinear partial differential equations to model complex physical systems and to prove how existing models apply to specific phenomena. \"I'm not the type of mathematician who develops an idea simply because it's beautiful mathematics,\" says T rivisa. \"I always have an application in mind that would interest an engineer, physicist or biologist. \" T ake the example of biologists studying the dynamics of flocking birds. Using traditional \"particle systems,\" the research is computationally expensive and time consum-ing. \"With my collaborators, I constructed a model that captures the relevant phenomena, How do mathematical models explain nature?9 including unpredictable events, such as the presence of wind. This model can greatly reduce the computational cost of investigation,\" says T rivisa. M uch of T rivisa's research focuses on developing the mathematical methods to better understand fluid dynamics, materials science and phase transition processes. She received a prestigious NSF Presidential Early CAREER Award for her work, and plans to apply her mathematical skills, using a fluid dynamics and mechanics approach, to biomedical issues. She is beginning to investigate fluid-structure interaction in blood flow, which is relevant for the design of cardiovascular treat-ments, such as stents used to improve the flow through narrow or weak arteries. A n ative of Greece, T rivisa moved to the United States in 1991 for her doctoral studies. She joined CMNS in 2000 and currently directs the interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Scientific Computation Program and is an affiliate professor in the Institute of Physical Science and T echnology. \"Working with a large community of scientists and engineers keeps me focused on the big questions in science,\" says T rivisa, who continues to foster scientific collaborations in which she can apply mathematics to provide key answers. nvisualization abo ve shows the e volution of four distin C t flo C ks of birds: as time passes, the birds approa C h ea C h other and finally merge to one flo C k as predi C ted by the model.

At the National Weather Service (NWS) from 1987 to 1997, she headed the research division that develops the computer atmospheric models and the methods for \"assimilating observations\" used for forecasting the weather. \"Our seven-day forecast is now about as accurate as a one or two-day forecast was in the 1960s,\" she notes. Still, weather prediction is difficult as evidenced by the storm that started in Iowa on June 29, 2012, and evolved into a \"derecho\" that moved eastward for more than 12 hours with very severe weather all the way to the Washington, D.C. region, leaving How can we improve weather forecasting? behind widespread devastation and power outages. Although the NWS Storm Prediction Center issued severe thunderstorm warnings along the route, further improvements in NWP means future warnings could be provided days, not hours, in advance. One of the k eys to improving weather forecasts is to ensure that atmospheric com-puter models start with an accurate estimate of current atmospheric conditions. As an expert on \"data assimilation,\" Kalnay develops methods to better determine initial conditions generated from observations, such as satellite and radar information. Researchers and students worldwide use her book, Atmospheric Modeling, Data Assimilation and Predictability, which has been translated into Chinese and Korean. K alnay and Distinguished University Professor James Y orke founded the college's Weather & Chaos group, which has made groundbreaking improvements in data assimilation systems and numerical weather prediction, graduating some 20 doctoral experts in the process. Kalnay is also a pioneer in ensemble forecasting, a technique that she developed and implemented operationally 20 years ago at the NWS. \"Instead of making a Ensemble forecasts by Eugenia Kalnay / Earth photo by NASA GOES Project / Kalnay photo by John Consoli10 single forecast, we use slightly different initial conditions and create an ensemble of 20 forecasts,\" she explains. \"This way, we can predict forecast uncertainty by examining where these weather forecasts agree or disagree, making them much more useful. \" The introduction of this information extended forecasts from three to seven days beginning in the mid 1990s. M ore recently, the ensemble approach has been combined with data assimilation in the Local Ensemble T ransform Kalman Filter, a method developed by Brian Hunt, a professor in the Weather & Chaos group, and adopted by several countries for oper-ational weather prediction. In the future, the approaches could have other important applications as well. \"The ideas of ensemble prediction and data assimilation could be adopted to improve forecasts of other types, such as economic forecasts,\" adds Kalnay. nNCEP-GFS E NSEmblE ForECaStS o F Hurri C a NE Sa N dy b lue 12 z oC t 23, 2012 g reen 18 z oC t 23, 2012 r ed 00 z oC t 24, 2012 b laC k sand y's a C tual tra C k Super Storm Sandy 14 o dyS S ey m ay 2013Decades before the popularity of organic farming and the promotion of organic fruits and vegetables in restaurants and grocery stores, Robert E. Menzer, M.S. '62, entomology, was studying the effects of pesticides on fruits and vegetables at the university. While a sophomore and president of the science club at Northwestern High School in Hyattsville, Md., Menzer connected with Entomology Professor Louis Dittman and spent his high school summers working at the university's Plant Research Farm in Fairland, Md., just seven miles outside of College Park. \"P esticide toxicology was a wide open field for a young biologist,\" recalls Menzer. Even while pursuing his undergraduate degree at The University of Pennsylvania, he continued to work on the farm. \"I helped to establish the pesticide residue analysis lab and conduct the studies to establish the proper guidelines for crop treatments,\" says Menzer, who ran the lab for two years while he pursued his master's at Maryland. Following doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin in pesticide toxicology, he returned to the university in 1965 to run the Department of Entomology's T oxicology Lab. \"P esticides that contained phosphorus were in rapid development at the time,\" explains Menzer. \"Some pesticides were being used prema - turely with little known about their behavior in the environment. We studied how specific chemicals degraded in plant and animal systems. \" Menzer's work led to restrictions on certain chemicals and has been used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in developing regulations on chemicals used in pesticides. Menzer also has served on the Safe Water Drinking Committee and the T oxicology Committee of the National Research Council formulating national standards for safe drinking water. M enzer is the founding director of the university's Marine Estuarine Environmental Science (MEES) graduate program. Created in 1978, it has grown into the University System of Maryland's largest graduate program in the environmental sciences. The program was groundbreaking in its interdisciplinary, multi-campus approach and its use of distance learning technology, according to Menzer.robert m enzer e stablishes aw ard to h onor g randson robert e. and sara l ee m enzer H is love of the program led him and his wife, Sara Lee Menzer, to create the Reid Evans Menzer Memorial Graduate Award with a $100,000 gift in honor of their grandson, who was just 14 years old when he died tragically as a result of a skateboard accident. \"Reid was a very intelligent child, an inventor. At age ten, he asked for and received a microscope for Christmas and enjoyed studying and photographing nature. \" The award is made annually to any MEES graduate student with superior academic merit and achievement. I n 1989, Menzer was named director of the EPA's Gulf Breeze Environmental Research Laboratory in Florida, one of the nation's most highly regarded labs in estuarine chemical toxicology, to explore pollution problems in estuarine systems. Later, when the EPA reorga-nized its Office of Research and Development at its National Center for Environmental Research, Menzer was named a senior science advisor, where he helped to initiate the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program and created joint programs with other federal agencies. L ast year, Menzer made another generous donation of nearly $100,000 to support the construction of new offices and digital class-rooms for the MEES program, which moved from Cole Field House to H.J. Patterson Hall in summer 2012. The new, large classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art electronics to transmit and receive lectures thoughout the state. These capabilities will allow the MEES program to offer more courses over the interactive video network to increasing numbers of students and improve the quality of the lectures. The new space will be dedicated on May 16 in recognition of Menzer's leadership and generosity to the university. T oday, Menzer still visits the university when he travels to the area as a consultant for the Hazardous Substances Data Bank Science Review Panel of the National Institutes of Health. Most of his time is spent enjoying the view from his Florida home, which sits on a bluff overlooking Pensacola Bay. An avid gardener, he says, \"I use pesticides when needed, but sparingly. We are just happy to have flowers in the garden all year round. \" nphilanthropy MEES Founding Director Helped Develop Standards on Pesticide Use (l to r) reid e vans m enzer's parents, k endall and r . e ri C m enzer, and s ister f ran C es.

Saint Helens outside Portland to studying the coral reefs of Bermuda, Laura Weber, B.S. '12, biology, participated in as many r esearch projects as possible during her CMNS career. S he encouraged that level of involvement among her peers as the student speaker for the CMNS December 2012 Commence- ment. \"We need to appreciate each day for the opportunities that we have, for the obstacles that we can overcome, and for the renewed chance of improving ourselves for the better,\" she told commencement participants. W hen Weber transferred to CMNS in spring 2010, she \"understood the importance of hands-on experiences and making connections to active researchers. \" That summer she traveled with Biology Professor Bill Fagan's research group to Mt. Saint Helens for three weeks to participate in ecology field research. Weber helped conduct vegetation surveys, characterizing different types of habitats. The research was used by the U.S. Forest Service and as part of a doctoral study on the correlation between vegetation and types of birds. \"We were up at the crack of dawn at the site and spent 12 hours identifying plants and shrubs and measuring the width and diameter of trees,\" Weber describes. The tr ip confirmed Weber's desire to work in nature. \"It was so peaceful and beautiful to be surrounded by nature, to appreciate it and actively become part of it. I realized I was becoming a scientist,\" recalls Weber. S he also gained experience as an undergraduate teaching assistant for an organismal biology course and served as a volunteer undergraduate research assistant in Biology Associate Professor Karen Lips's lab. There she sampled and analyzed bacteria and fungi on salamander skin to identify antibiotic properties that could be used to control a fungus attacking frogs. \" All of these experiences were helping me prepare for life as a graduate student,\" says Weber. A s recipient of the Erik P . Y oung, M.D., International T ravel Study Abroad Award, Weber spent fall 2012 at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences, where she took a scuba-diving research methods course and collected specimens for her independent research project focusing on the interaction between microbes and corals while completing coral reef ecology and invertebrate biology courses. Weber is now working at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Marine Chemical and Geochemistry Department in Mas - sachusetts analyzing both the microbial and chemical components of coral mucus as part of the Guest Student Researcher Program. Thi s fall, she hopes to begin her graduate studies with a focus on coral reef microbiology. \"I want to investigate microbe assem-blages that live on coral and improve coral survival rates in stressful, changing environments,\" Weber explains. \"We need to learn why corals in Indonesia and the Pacific may adapt to climate change better than those in the Caribbean. \" Thr ough all of her varied research experiences, Weber has learned valuable lessons. \"Keep seeking opportunities, no matter what the probability of getting that scholarship or internship. Be persistent, and take risks. Every experience will help you become the scientist you are meant to be. \" nStudent profile laura weber Condu C ts resear C h on Coral reefs off the Co ast of b ermuda through a study abroad experien C e with the b ermuda i nstitute of oC ean sC ien C es.
