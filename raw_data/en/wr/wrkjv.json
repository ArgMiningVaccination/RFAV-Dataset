Box 168, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming 82190 USA Abstract abortus , the causative agent of bovine brucellosis, infects wildlife, cattle, and humans worldwide, but management of the disease is often hindered by the logistics of controlling its prevalence in wildlife re servoirs. We used an individually based epidemiological model to assess the relative efcacies of three management interventions (sterilization, vaccination, and test-and-remove). The model was parameterized with demographic and epidemiological data from bison in Yellowstone National Park, USA.Sterilization and test-and-remove were most successful at reducing seroprevalence when theywere targeted at young seropositive animals, which are the most likely age and sex category to be infectious. However, these approaches also required the most effort to implement. Vaccination was less effective (even with a perfect vaccine) but also required less effort toimplement. For the treatment efforts we explored (50-100 individuals per year or 2.5-5 %of the female population), sterilization had little impact upon the bison population growth rate when selectively applied. The population growth rate usually increased by year 25 due to the reduced number of Brucella -induced abortions. Initial declines in seroprevalence followed by rapid increases ( .15%increase in 5 years) occurred in 3-13 %of simulations with sterilization and test-and-remove, but not vaccination. We believe this is due to the interaction of superspreading events and the loss of herd immunity in the later stages of control efforts asdisease prevalence declines. Sterilization provided a mechanism for achieving large diseasereductions while simultaneously limiting population growth, which may be advantageous in some management scenarios. However, the eld effort required to nd the small segment of the population that is infectious rather than susceptible or recovered will likely limit the utilityof this approach in many free-ranging wildlife populations. Nevertheless, we encouragescientists and policy makers to consider sterilization as part of a suite of available brucellosis management tools. the brucellosis, are among the most common zoonotic pathogensworldwide (Godfroid 2002, Corbel 2006). Althoughreported incidence and prevalence of the disease varywidely from country to country, bovine brucellosiscaused by Brucella abortus remains the most prevalent of the brucellar infections (Corbel 1997). In animals, thepreponderance of known bovine brucellosis is indomestic livestock, though many wild mammals, andespecially artiodactyls, often suffer spillover infectionsfrom domestic sources (Davis 1990, Bengis et al. 2002,Godfroid 2002). Most experts agree that brucellosis inwild animal species does not contribute signicantly toany pattern of disease in livestock (Madsen andAnderson 1995). However, infected wildlife becomes an important management concern when host popula-tions are able to sustain brucellar infections independentfrom domestic spillover. For B. abortus , several notable wildlife systems fall under this scenario including African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer ) in South Africa (Madsen ( Cervus elaphus ) in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem in North America (Meyer and Meagher 1995,Rhyan et al. 2009, Cross et al. 2010). These sustainableinfections in wildlife become increasingly importantwhen they serve as possible sources of reinfection for domestic stock in the nal stages of what are often long and expensive domestic brucellosis eradication cam-paigns (Madsen and Anderson 1995, Godfroid 2002). Bison and elk in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem are perhaps the most widely publicized case of wildlife reservoirs threatening reinfection of what is otherwise Manuscript received 19 November 2010; revised 13 May 2011; accepted 25 May 2011.

First detected in the United States in the early1900s, by the mid-1930s brucellosis was considered the most signicant livestock disease in the United States. To combat this problem, the U.S. Congress appropri-ated funds in the 1950s for a comprehensive national effort to eradicate brucellosis from domestic stocks (Cheville et al. 1998, Ragan 2002). An aggressive processof serological testing for brucellosis, followed by the removal of test-positive animals from the population and vaccination of test-negative animals, had nearlyeliminated the disease from livestock by the early 1990s (Ragan 2002). However, B. abortus spilled over from cattle to Yellowstone bison by 1917 (Meagher andMeyer 1994) and spread through the population, which is now chronically infected with 40-60 %of tested bison showing positive signs of exposure to this nonnativedisease (Hobbs et al. 2009). Brucellosis transmission occurs when B. abortus - infected birthing tissues are shed onto the landscapeand contacted by susceptible animals (Thorne 2001). Elk have been implicated as the probable source of recent brucellosis transmission events to cattle (Beja-Pereira etal. 2009), but bison remain a focal point of management (U.S. Government Accountability Ofce 2008). From 2004 to 2010, at least one cattle herd was exposed tobrucellosis each year in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming (Plumb et al. 2009, Wyoming Livestock Board 2010). These outbreaks resulted in each state temporarily losingits brucellosis-free status. Federal brucellosis class-free status provides signicant economic benets to a state's cattle industry, including reduced costs for testing andvaccinating against the disease, and greater access to within- and out-of-state cattle markets (Kilpatrick et al. 2009). Yellowstone bison are migratory, with most bison moving from higher elevation summer ranges inside Yellowstone National Park to lower elevation winterranges in and outside the park. Problems arise when migration results in bison moving beyond the boundar- ies of designated conservation areas and onto nearbyranges where cattle summer (Meagher 1989, Cheville et al. 1998, Bruggeman et al. 2009, Plumb et al. 2009). In 2000, after nearly 10 years of negotiations, the FederalGovernment and State of Montana agreed to an Interagency Bison Management Plan (IBMP) that established guidelines for managing the risk of brucel-losis transmission from bison to cattle through the use of hazing, test-and-slaughter, hunting, and other actions near the park boundary, when necessary (U.S. DOI,NPS, USDA-FS, and APHIS 2000 a,b). The IBMP management activities are costly and controversial. A 2008 Government Accountability Ofce (GOA) reportestimated the annual expenditure of nearly U.S.$3million (2002-2007 adjusted for inflation to 2009 dollars) for all aspects related to bison management (U.S. GOA 2008). Under the IBMP (2001-2010), ;3200 bison have been shipped to slaughter when hazingbecame ineffective at keeping bison in designated conservation areas (White et al. 2011). More than1000 bison were culled from the population during winter 2006, and an estimated 1700 bison were culled during winter 2008 ( ;21%and 37 %of the total population, respectively; White et al. 2011). Our objective was to use an epidemiological model to simulate the effects of different disease management strategies on brucellosis prevalence and bison popula-tion dynamics. Unlike many disease models that are ''top-down,'' or phenomenological in nature, we utilized a mechanistic approach whereby disease dynamics aredriven by mechanisms operating on individual bison (e.g., contacts per infectious event and transmission). Although a variety of management strategies exist, wefocused our modeling efforts on three different man- agement strategies suggested by the various IBMP sterilization(U.S. DOI, NPS, USDA-FS, and APHIS 2000 a, Rhyan and Drew 2002, Miller et al. 2004). Here, sterilization is used to directly impact infectious events (e.g., abortions,still births, retained placentas) associated with pregnan- cy and not as a population control device with the intent of reducing host density. Our conceptual framework for applying management strategies was built around the operational toolsavailable to wildlife managers: age classication and serological status. Due to the diagnostic limitations to identifying and treating infectious individuals in theeld, current anti-mortem tests rely on serological results. Serology only provides indirect evidence of infection because it detects antibodies rather than livingbacteria, and thus, cannot differentiate between infec- tious and recovered individuals. The biology of brucel- losis in ungulates, however, allows management effortsto be more targeted. Males and pre-reproductive females are unlikely to transmit infection (Cheville et al. 1998), and old seropositive females are more likely to berecovered than infectious. Thus, young reproductive females (3-5 year olds for bison) are presumably driving much of the disease dynamics. We explore the effects of''target selectivity'' for each management strategy by using different seroprevalence and age-class combina- tions as management targets. The current brucellosis vaccine for cattle, Strain RB51, is effective in preventing clinical brucellosissymptoms (e.g., abortions and infectious live births), but will not result in positive reactions on serologic tests. Consequently, vaccinated bison will remain test negativeunless exposed to eld strain Brucella following vacci- nation (Olsen et al. 2009, 2010). Although the vaccine is expected to reduce B. abortus shedding and subsequent transmission and not influence serologic results (i.e., create false positives), it will not prevent subsequent seroconversion upon exposure to B. abortus . Finally, the logistics of implementing domestic disease control strategies in wildlife are often difcult in a wildsetting (Rhyan and 2945 BISON BRUCELLOSIS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIEStracked the effort required to implement various strategies including the number of animals handledand the amount of serological testing. While our measure of effort does not relate to the actual cost of managing brucellosis in bison, it does provide a relativemeasure which can play a vital role in choosing between inexpensive, weak controls that lead to smaller and slower changes in disease prevalence, or expensive (butperhaps more cost effective) controls that lead to faster and larger management impacts (Keeling and Rohani 2008). M ETHODS We used a stochastic, individual-based modeling approach following the structure of Gross et al. (1998) and Treanor et al. (2010) to account for B. abortus transmission dynamics each year from January 1 through the last birthing event on a weekly time step,and then adjusted for annual reproduction and survival (Fig. 1A). We allowed the model to stabilize for the rst 14 years, applied management actions starting at year15, and tracked model output through 35 years of consecutive treatment. We used estimates of age-specic pregnancy rates and survivorship, growth rate ( k), and stable age distribution for the Yellowstone bison population to seed the initialpopulation model (Table 1, Fig. 1; Fuller et al. 2007 a). For the case of Yellowstone bison, it is difcult to compare management strategies in the absence of anyremovals because this has been the primary mechanism of population regulation for several decades (Cheville et al. 1998). We assumed that the bison population waslimited to 1600 yearling and adult females through an annual removal process. At the beginning of a simula- tion year (i.e., Jan 1) the number of adult and yearlinganimals above the threshold (1600) was calculated andthis determined the number of animals for non-disease- related removal. These removals were spread evenly over the rst two months to simulate the timing of boundaryremovals and individuals were selected randomly from the population without respect to disease status. This approach does not capture the stochastic variation ofactual bison removals, but enables a more direct interpretation of differences among management strat- egies. Pregnant bison were assigned a random concep-tion week from a truncated normal distribution with peak conception occurring at week 30.5 over a span of 9 weeks (range 26-35). These conception dates, coupledwith a 41-week gestation period, provided a time span of birthing events similar to that observed in wild bison (Berger and Cain 1999, Walde 2006, Jones et al. 2009). We used a weekly time step to model the transmission season, which we assumed overlapped the third trimesterof pregnancy when abortions and births typically occur(Cheville et al. 1998, Jones et al. 2010, Treanor et al. 2010). We tracked disease dynamics by classifying bison as susceptible, exposed, infectious, or recovered (SEIR;Fig. 1B; Keeling and Rohani 2008). Following exposure,susceptible individuals enter an exposed class, which lasts for ve weeks (Gross et al. 1998) and terminateswith transition into the infectious class. For the duration of an infectious pregnant bison's third trimester, the fate of the fetus during each time step followed a Bernoulliprocess, where independent but identical weekly Ber- noulli trials for abortion with probability d(Table 1) determined if an abortion occurred. After an abortion,individuals may either remain in the infected class based on the probability of recovery cor transition to the recovered class. Bison that did not abort during theannual time step may shed bacteria during a live birth with probability wbefore moving to the recovered class. We dened the recovered class in our model as havingimmunity to B. abortus challenges, but allowed these recovered individuals to recrudesce back to the infec- tious class with probability xfollowing a Bernoulli structure (Table 1). Once an animal recrudesced, theywere indistinguishable from more recent seroconverters (i.e., individuals moving from susceptible to infectious class; Rhyan et al. 2009). We incorporated bison group size (M. Meagher, unpublished data ) and mixing rates into the disease dynamics during the model development phase. For social mammals (Bonabeau et al. 1999), including bison (M. Meagher, unpublished data ), group size typically follows a power law distribution that is influenced by overall population abundance. Also, data suggest that group stability is low for bison (Lott 1991, Fortin et al.2009). From the perspective of a disease that typically has a long latency period between contact and subse- quent transmission (i.e., spanning biological seasons)the fluid group structure of Yellowstone bison dimin- ishes the role of group structure by decreasing the potential for strong infection heterogeneity betweenbison social groups. Accordingly, we used well-mixedgroups in the model, but retained group structure for sensitivity analysis, which showed that group size and mixing rates were relatively unimportant unless groupsizes were uniformly distributed or mixing rates were very low (0.05 %groups change per week). While group structure is an obvious part of bison behavior, the distribution of contacts with infectious material (i.e., transmission) plays a more critical role indisease dynamics. We determined the number of bison contacting each infectious event by drawing from a negative binomial distribution tted to empirical contactdata (Jones et al. 2009, Treanor et al. 2010). The contact data are the number of bison inspecting a live birth, which we used as a proxy for contacts with infectiousmaterial. Bison contacts with live births were heavily right skewed, whereby many births had few or zero contacts and a few births had many contacts (Fig. 2).Use of such long-tailed contact distributions may beimportant for capturing the rare but large transmissions that may occur when females retain placentas (lasting as long as three days and for distances exceeding 5 km), orabortions happen in places where infectious materialMIKE EBINGER ET AL. 2946Ecological Applications Vol. 21, No. 8persists for extended periods in the environment (Corbel 1989, Jones et al. 2009, 2010). We mechanistically modeled transmission by drawing the number of contacts per infectious event and, for those contacts that were with susceptible bison, conducting aBernoulli trial with probability uto determine who was infected, where uis the probability of transmission given contact (Table 1). The necessary data do not currentlyexist to correlate the number of contacts with bison group size, although such a relationship may exist. Restrictingthe number of contacts by group size (i.e., truncating random draws from the contact distribution by group size) would have altered the realized contact distribution for a given simulation from the intended distribution(e.g., empirical t). Therefore, contacts were rst randomly assigned to those in the same group and then if the number of contacts was greater than the group size contacts were randomly assigned to others in the population. We explored additional distributions includ-ing Poisson and other negative binomials representing FIG. 1.

Male births were included in the model to account for abortions and infectious live births from male fetuses and offspring. We considered mothers and calves as a single unit for several months (male \u00afx\u00bc9 months; female\u00afx\u00bc14 months), whereby if the mother contacted a fetus so did her calf, because this matched the way the contact data were collected (Treanor et al. 2010). Once the mother-calf bond was broken, male calves were removed from the model. Adult males are typically not present at birthing locations and thus are not represent- ed in the empirical contact data.TABLE 1. Model parameters, symbols, and sources used in the simulation model.

Comparison of the empirical and tted bison contact distributions.

We also varied the probability of transmission given contact ( u). To determine reasonable parameter combinations, we randomly selected values for all parameters from a uniform distribution and ran models without any management actions. We compared several summary statistics to model results as a way of discarding parameter sets that were implausible. First, annual seroprevalence of brucellosis in bison has varied between 0.40 and 0.60. Second, Roffe et al. (1999) found that 46 %of 26 seropositive samples were culture positive, where culture positive status is currently the best indicator of recent seroconversion and whether an individual may be infectious (Rhyan et al. 2009). Thus, we used the 95 %condence intervals surrounding the 46 %estimate (0.29-0.65) as a feasible range for the proportion of seropositive bison that were actually infectious as opposed to recovered. Finally, bison population growth rate estimates have ranged between 1.05 and 1.07 from 1990 to 2001 (Fuller et al. 2007a,b). Parameter combinations that yielded modelresults falling within the above ranges for all three summary statistics were considered plausible scenarios for endemic disease dynamics. We ran 800 simulations of random parameter combinations for each contact distribution to produce a subset of plausible parameter combinations for each distribution. Although moderate to low levels of transmission given contact ( u) were able to produce plausible results, our knowledge of brucellosis suggested that the massive number of B. abortus in birthing fluids and aborted material in combination with the strong attractant effect of expelled fetal membranes (Cheville et al. 1998) should translate to a high probability of transmission given contact with an infectious event. We allowed this parameter to slightly vary, so as to facilitate the tting of the other parameters, but required it to remain relatively high (range \u00bc0.925-1.000) across all param- eter combinations and contact distributions. Rhyan et al. (2009) cultured B. abortus from some bison up to three years after seroconversion, and observed a large variation in subsequent reproductive outcomes of seroconverters, including a small proportion that had reproductive failures for four years after infection. We allowed this data set to guide our selection for the baseline recovery probability. We set this parameter to vary between 0.725 and 0.775 across all contact PLATE 1. Bison calf. credit: Rick Wallen/NPS.December 2011 2949 BISON BRUCELLOSIS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIESdistributions, resulting in probabilities of remaining in the infectious class after reproductive failure to beapproximately 0.25, 0.063, and 0.016 for 2, 3, or 4 consecutive years, respectively. We used two ranges for the probability of recrudescence ( x) from the recovered class; a ''low'' recrudescence per year; ( x) interacts with probability of recovery ( c), where if one is high the other must also be high to keep the summary statistics (i.e., proportion of seropositive bison that areinfectious, seroprevalence, and population growth rate) within plausible ranges. Management actions We simulated test-and-remove, vaccination, and sterilization strategies. We assumed 100 %efcacy and life treatment effects for vaccination and sterilization,and that all treated individuals were protected from abortion and/or infectious live births until death (i.e., lifetime coverage). We further assumed that vaccinatedand sterilized animals did not become infected and develop antibodies after contacting infectious material (alternatively, that they were distinguishable via sero-logical test or physical markings). We realize that brucellosis vaccines have imperfect efcacy and provide only limited protection against infection and serocon-version after exposure to virulent B. abortus strains (Olsen et al. 2009, Treanor et al. 2010). However, we made this assumption in an effort to contain modelcomplexity and aid in comparisons with other treatment types that had lasting effects (sterilization and lethal removal). Furthermore, issues with efcacy of vaccina-tion should be easily translatable to our general results (e.g., if the objective is 100 vaccinations, a 75 %vaccine efcacy means you would have to treat 133 individualsto achieve the objective). Each strategy was applied at three different annual objective treatment levels (50, 75, and 100 individualsper year for 35 consecutive years). Objective levels represented the number of individuals that managers attempt to treat each year. We refer to these as''objectives'' as they were often not achievable every year if the strategy required the treatment of seropositive individuals. Once management successfully reduced thenumber of seropositive bison in the population to below the objective level, complete treatment was not possible. The inability to achieve an objective level was a largerissue for selective treatment based on both age and serology, which we cover in the following sections. We also modeled selective and nonselective manage- ment strategies. For test-and-remove and sterilization, selective approaches focused on pre-reproductive sero-positive animals, which are likely to be infectious atsome point in the future, typically upon rst pregnancy following infection. Test-and-remove and sterilization approaches applied nonselectively treat any seropositivebison regardless of age. For vaccination, selectivemanagement involves the vaccination of seronegative female calves to provide protection as soon as possible.Nonselective vaccination attempts to mimic a remotevaccination scenario where no serological test isinvolved. However, we restricted the target to femalecalves to make more straightforward comparisons to the selective treatments. We can draw conclusions on how remote delivery would work on all calves by assumingthat 50%of the treatments would be male calves. We also tested a suite of mixed strategies (i.e., vaccination and sterilization, vaccination and test-and-remove) to evaluate if they enhanced the use ofvaccination in isolation. For these strategies, we usedobjective treatment levels of 50, 75, or 100 bison per yearand applied vaccination to test-negative bison andsterilization or lethal removal to test-positive bisonwithin the target group. Mixed strategies do not haveselective and nonselective application since all individ- uals are treated. Instead, we used two different types of target groups for mixed management: (1) pre-reproduc-tive females and (2) females of any age. The proportion of bison with antibodies indicating B. abortus exposure (i.e., seroprevalence) can be used to quantify and compare the efcacy of different brucello-sis reduction strategies, but results can be misleadingunless two additional metrics are provided: (1) thenumber of individuals treated and (2) the effortexpended to nd these animals within the population.We quantied the proportion of the objective level treated during each year of management. The amount of effort required to implement a given strategy involvesthe amount of serological testing needed to treat a givenobjective level. We used the ratio of bison handled tobison treated as an index of effort. The effort index was1 for strategies that ignored serological status (e.g.,remote vaccination and mixed vaccination strategies)where treatments were applied to every individual withinthe target group. We assumed that managers would beunaware of the true seroprevalence in the populationand would continue serological testing until either allindividuals were tested or the objective level wasachieved. Thus, strategies unable to meet the objectivetreatment levels result in high effort indices. By usingour effort index as a measure of efciency, wedeliberately ignored the time required to captureindividuals or the monetary expense of treatment, whichare highly variable and situation specic. Thus, to achieve generality, we restricted our discussion to the number of animals handled and treated, and allow thereader to apply cost estimates to weight efciency in acase-specic fashion (Hobbs et al. 2000). For each contact distribution, each management category received 12 simulation types (three objectivetreatment levels by two selectivity [low, high]). 40 times and all simulations wereconducted in MATLAB version 7.6 (Mathworks 2008).MIKE EBINGER ET AL. 2950Ecological Applications Vol. 21, No. 8RESULTS The reductions in seroprevalence were often highly variable within a given parameter set, but sterilization was generally more effective at reducing seroprevalence than either test-and-remove or vaccination for a given objective level. Nonselective sterilization outperformed selective sterilization when 75 or 100 bison per year were treated; achieving 100 %eradication before the 35 years of treatment was complete (Fig. 3). Differences in selectivity increased with the magnitude of reduction in seroprevalence and were most common for test-and- remove management (Appendix B: Figs. B1-B3). The high portion of calves that were seronegative made nonselective and selective vaccination almost indistin- guishable in their ability to reduce seroprevalence. However, when nonselective vaccination included all ages, a higher percentage of vaccinations were ineffective because they treated seropositive animals and seroprev- alence was ;6-8%higher at the end of simulations. When compared to vaccination alone, mixed strate- gies showed improvement when applied to pre-repro- ductive individuals and t his effect increased with treatment levels (Appendix B: Fig. B4). Mixed strategies showed little difference in mean seroprevalence ( 65%) regardless of which treatment was applied to test- positive bison, suggesting that over the course of time (35 years of treatment) vaccination was the primary factor influencing dynamics.Vaccination and mixed strategies resulted in 100 %of the objective treatment level being met for both selective and nonselective approaches across all treatment levels. By treating only seropositive animals, selective test-and- remove and sterilization result in very high handling to treatment ratios as seroprevalence declined (Fig. 4; Appendix B: Fig. B5). Nonselective test-and-remove and sterilization resulted in lower handling to treatment ratios compared to selective strategies (Fig. 4), but because nonselective applications also focused only on seropositive individuals the handling to treatment ratio was high when seroprevalence was low. The effort required for different management strate- gies was dependent on seroprevalence and whether management targeted seronegative or seropositive ani- mals. If objective levels were not met during manage- ment treatments, then all individuals in the target group eventually were tested and handled-to-treated ratios became very large. This issue only arose for strategies that treated seropositiv es and were successful at reducing their prevalence in the population (Appendix B: Fig. B.6). As seroprevalence dropped to ,10%, sharp increases in effort occurred and handled to treated ratios sometimes exceeded 1000:1 due to the effort required to nd the last few seropositive animals in the population. We considered index values .50:1 to be of little interest to managers, as their sustained application seems impractical, if not impossible. Therefore, we FIG. 3.

The gray bar at the top of each plot is the interquartile range for reference simulations (i.e., no management actions).December 2011 2951 BISON BRUCELLOSIS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIESfocused on reporting the results for the rst decade of treatment when ratios typically stayed below this level. This allowed for more meaningful comparisons of strategies, across treatment levels, and selectivity sce- narios that might actually be applicable in eld situations. Selective management under sterilization resulted in a seroprevalence of 20 %or less during 13.5%(objective \u00bc50 per year) and 41.3 %(objective \u00bc100 per year) of simulations during the rst decade of management. Selective test-and-remove reached the same benchmark only ,0.1%(objective \u00bc50 per year) and 18.3 %(objective \u00bc100 per year) of simulation years. This larger reduction in seroprevalence with fewer available animals to treat during the rst decade of treatment resulted in higher effort values for sterilization compared to test-and-remove, as well as a shorter duration of management years to reach a given effort level (Fig. 4). Nonselective treatment of seropositives signicantly reduced the amount of effort required for both sterilization and test-and-remove across all objec- tive levels (Fig. 4). The ability to frequently reach objective levels during the rst decade of treatment using nonselective sterilization achieved the largest reductions in seroprevalence for the least amount of effort. The mean effort for simulation years with a seroprevalence of 20%was 27.9 handled/treated for selective and 4.1 handled/treated for nonselective sterilization treatments. Beyond the rst decade of treatment, strategies that targeted seropositive bison had difculty regardless of strategy or selectivity when seroprevalence dropped to ,10%. Selective vaccination required low effort, with values fluctuating just above one as the majority of calves tested negative for brucellosis exposure. Under nonselective and mixed applications, vaccination had a constant value of 1 as individuals were targeted regardless of age and without a serological test (i.e., every captured individual was treated). It should be noted that test-and-remove and sterilization strategies can regain some of their effort expenditure when considering the amount of effort required for population management, but interactions between disease preva- lence and population growth rate must also be considered. Seroprevalence was highly correlated with population growth rate in the absence of sterilization (Fig. 5). Nonselective sterilization caused initial decreases in seroprevalence and population growth rate (Fig. 5). As time progressed, however, sterilization counterintuitive- ly resulted in higher population growth rates because the concomitant reduction in seroprevalence also reduced the number of disease-induced abortions. (Fig. 5; Appendix B, Figs. B7-B8). Under the nonselective treatment of 100 bison per year, the mean peak in the proportion of sterilized bison ( \u00afx\u00bc0.28, r\u00bc0.02) occurred between years 9 and 15 of consecutive treatment and led to eradication of the disease and the cessation of sterilization treatments. Thus, the highest population growth rates ( k'1.1) occurred in simula- tions with aggressive sterilization, which resulted in disease eradication. Once treatments stopped all steril- ized bison eventually died and population growth rates increased. Many simulations showed rapid rebounds in sero- prevalence after initial declines, a phenomenon we refer to as a ricochet (Fig. 6). These anomalies occurred in 9 % of test-and-remove simulations and 4 %of sterilization FIG. 4.

Under selective treatments, the frequency of simulations experiencing ricochet events decreased with increasing objective levels for both management types (test-and-remove, nonselective test-and- removal resulting in an increasing frequency of events with treatment level (test-and-remove, range (50,75,100) \u00bc 0.13-0.03).

High recrudescence primarily influenced the sterilization and test-and-remove strategies that fo- cused on test-positive bison, with slight differences for vaccination (Appendix C: Fig. C1). In general, high recrudescence reduced the ability of high selectivity to decrease seroprevalence to very low levels (beyond 30 % reduction in seroprevalence) and achieve eradications due to older individuals reverting to an infectious state from the recovered class and reducing the efcacy of focusing only on the pre-reproductive, test-positive class. The impact of recrudescence increased with increasing effect size (i.e., relative change in seroprev- a l e n c e ;F i g .3 ;A p p e n d i xC :F i g .C 2 ) .T h es l o w e r decreases in seroprevalence under high selectivity resulted in lower effort index values and slower decreases in the treated proportion of the objective levels (Appendix C: Figs. C3-C5). Higher Recrudescence had a relatively minor effect on vaccination, with slightly smaller decreases in seroprevalence under high recrudescence. A Poisson contact distribution with the same mean number of contacts as the empirical negative binomial underrepresented the number of zero contacts and the rare but larger contact events when compared to the empirical data. We also extended the contact distribu- tion toward more long-tailed negative binomial distri- butions with fewer zero contacts and a greater magnitude in the rare but large events (Appendix A:Table A1). Changes in the contact distribution required changes in the probability of recovery ( c) and or recrudescence ( x) to produce outcomes that were within the upper bound (0.60) of seroprevalence observed in Yellowstone bison. Although we xed the probability of transmission given contact ( u) to be relatively high (see Methods section), in theory, this parameter could also be adjusted to account for alternate contact distributions (see Discussion section). We had difculty nding parameter combinations that t the empirical lters for high recrudescence with increasing heterogeneity in contacts and the modeled values used for high recru- descence under the two most heterogeneous distribu- tions were slightly lower than preferred, but still at least two times the low recrudescence value. The performance of vaccination was robust to the type of contact distribution across all management and selectivity levels, with the mean reduction in seropreva- lence only varying a few prevalence points. Sterilization was sensitive to contact distribution, mostly in its ability to reduce seroprevalence at the objective level of 50 bison per year and to achieve true eradication. Sterilization appeared insensitive to the contact heterogeneity when 100 bison per year were nonselectively treated. Test-and- remove showed an increasing loss of power to reduce seroprevalence under selective application with increasing skew of the contact distribution. Objective levels of 50 and 75 bison per year were not able to move seroprev- alence beyond vaccination levels and at the higher treatment levels reductions in seroprevalence were often overcome by an increased frequency of ricochets. However, when we reduced the variability of the contact distribution by modeling it as a Poisson distribution ricochet events no longer occurred regardless of the management strategy. Under the heaviest tailed distribu- FIG. 6. Example of ricochet events in the times series for selective test-and-remove with an objective treatment level of 50 bison/ yr. The bold black lines are examples of simulations experiencing ricochet events. Also apparent in the time series were early departures from the overall declining trend that are driven by the same dynamics as ricochets, but do not appear as rebounds because they occur early in the time series.MIKE EBINGER ET AL. 2954Ecological Applications Vol. 21, No. 8tion (contact distribution C; Appendix A: Fig. A1), test- and-remove of 100 bison per year experienced ricochetevents during 50 %of the simulations, and had a mean seroprevalence of 30 %after 35 years of consecutive treatment. The robust performance of vaccination andsterilization compared to test-and-remove under different contact distributions suggests that the maintenance of herd immunity during disease mitigation, and the indirectprotection these treated animals provide to susceptible individuals, became increasingly important with increased heterogeneity in the contact distribution. Under increasedright-skew of alternate contact distributions, seropreva- lence was more difcult to reduce and births were not offset by a concomitant reduction of abortions whenmanagement achieved objective levels for longer periods of time and more individuals were treated. Under such scenarios, there was a sustained decrease in the popula-tion growth rate for the entire simulation (Appendix C:Fig. C6). D ISCUSSION In most systems, the control of disease in wildlife populations remains difcult, if not impossible, due to logistical, nancial, and sociological constraints. Man-agers are often faced with difcult decision between investing in cheap, weak management actions vs. more expensive but powerful approaches that are perhapsmore cost effective in the long run (Keeling and Rohani 2008). Further complicating wildlife disease manage- ment is the tendency towards reductionist approachesand a focus on immediate results, however, as the ricochet events we observed in our model demonstrate, short-sighted assessments may be overly optimistic. Brucellosis in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem is no exception to the abovementioned issues, but the biologyofB. abortus does lend itself to more selective control strategies. In particular, males are assumed to play a negligible role in transmission and, if positive culture results are any indication of infectiousness, probably,50%of seropositive adult females are infectious. Further, the overriding importance of pregnancy and the reproductive system in the life cycle of B. abortus (Cheville et al. 1998) means pre-reproductive females, when infected, are unlikely to be infectious until they become pregnant. Thus, young reproductively activeseropositive females are likely to drive brucellosis dynamics, but represent a small proportion of the population. As a result, sterilization focused on thispopulation segment can be a highly effective strategy at relatively low treatment levels ( ,5%of the female population treated annually). However, because thistreatment can be highly selective, it also requires more effort to nd the appropriate individuals, which becomes more and more difcult as seroprevalence declines. During the course of our simulations, we observed a dynamic that we refer to as a ricochet, which is likely to be generally applicable to other disease control anderadication programs. As seroprevalence and herdimmunity declined due to test-and-remove or steriliza- tion, a proportion of simulations had large subsequentincreases in seroprevalence, sometimes increasing to pretreatment levels. We believe two factors drive this phenomenon: First, the well mixed nature of bisongroups and long time intervals between contact and subsequent transmission allow contacts with infectious material (e.g., an abortion event within a group) tobecome widely dispersed by the time infected individuals are at risk of transmitting the disease. Second, there appears to be an interaction between herd immunity andtransmission heterogeneity, which we model here as anegative binomial contact distribution. When seroprev- alence is high, abortion events resulting in a large number of contacts result in less transmission than whenthe population is composed of a high proportion of susceptible individuals. Thus, the occurrence of super- spreading events are likely to increase as herd immunitydecreases. Sterilization produced fewer ricochets than test-and-remove because treated individuals are not replaced in the population by susceptibles, but insteadserve as dead-end hosts interfering with transmission and indirectly protecting some susceptible individuals from contacting infectious events. In a similar fashion,when seropositive treatments involve recovered individ-uals, sterilization does not result in their replacement with susceptible individuals (via birth) as is the case for test-and-remove. While the ability of sterilization toproduce herd immunity effects is reduced as sero- positives become increasing rare in the population, the opposite is true for vaccination. By treating susceptibleindividuals, vaccination provides individual protection and substantial herd immunity effects in the unprotected segment of the population while seroprevalence declines.For example, when relatively few individuals areresponsible for most of the transmission, vaccination efcacy does not hinge on treating these key individuals as in the case of test-and-remove and sterilization; whatmatters is the proportion of vaccine protected individ- uals in the population at large. The direct treatment of the infected class is clearly a powerful force in the reduction of disease transmission. However, treating infected individuals is complicated bydiagnostics, which in the case of serology only provide information on exposure. We assessed the efcacy of using age and serology together through selectivetreatments to increase the potential of treating infectiousindividuals and how those treatments impact disease and population dynamics. Under selective applications, the power of treating pre-reproductive seropositives quicklyreduces seroprevalence, but this reduces the influx of individuals entering the recovered class, thus reducing herd immunity. As management actions decrease theforce of infection, the average age of infection increases (Anderson and May 1991). For selective management, the narrow focus on pre-reproductive bison that initiallyserved as a strength changes to a weakness as the average age of infection slides beyond management's relativelyDecember 2011 2955 BISON BRUCELLOSIS MANAGEMENT STRATEGIESnarrow eld of view. Without a substantial herd immunity effect, transmission can proceed uncheckedand prevalence levels rise accordingly. More sophisticated and flexible strategies that decrease selectivity as sero- prevalence declines would provide more efcient diseasemitigation in the long run. Our simulations showed large variations in potential outcomes across all management strategies after 35 years of consecutive treatment, especially for strategies focusing on treating seropositive animals (Fig. 3). Whilethe initial and short-term impacts of management on seroprevalence ( ,10 years) were often similar, they were not reliable indicators of long term trends (Fig. 6).Accordingly, optimistic views about reductions and/or eradication based solely on the initial years of manage- ment may not reflect the true trajectory of diseasedynamics. It is important for readers to focus on the range of simulation outcomes when evaluating model results as this indicates both the best and worst casescenarios for a given strategy. Reductions in brucellosis seroprevalence are likely to result in increases in population growth rate (Fig. 5; Fuller et al. 2007 a). In the Yellowstone context, an increased growth rate will probably result in more bisonleaving the park and increased boundary removals (Geremia et al. 2011). This may have far-reaching consequences because there is a positive relationshipbetween the number of bison leaving the park and the overall population size (Cheville et al. 1998, Kilpatrick et al. 2009). Given that brucellosis eradication in thenear future is unlikely (Bienen and Tabor 2006, Treanor et al. 2010), the costs of boundary management could potentially increase in the future if bison have higherpopulation growth rates. Sterilization provides a means to impact both seroprevalence and population growth rate. Nonselective sterilization reduced populationgrowth rate, but population growth rate did rebound and even exceeded pre-treatment levels if the disease was eradicated and/or treatments ceased. One potentialapproach for sterilization is in a mixed framework with vaccination, where it may counteract the shift from infectious abortions to healthy live births as diseaseprevalence declines. For example, under mixed vaccina- tion and sterilization, ;5%sterilization level resulted in a sustained population growth rate when seroprevalenceis reduced to the 15-25 %range (Appendix B: Fig. B10). Achieving these minor levels of sterilization in the mixed context required a treatment across all ages, becausefocusing on only pre-reproductive females or calves failed to reach sterilization levels above 3 %. Our model shows that sterilization, when used as a means of preventing pregnancy in brucellosis-infected bison rather than for population control, can be apowerful management tool. Although the intention of sterilization is not population control, if not considered carefully, the potential exists for unintended andpotentially catastrophic results such as sustained nega- tive population growth ( k,1.0) for prolonged periods.If sterilization does not treat enough infectious individ- uals, but instead treats mostly recovered animals, thenthe reduction in live births due to sterilization is not offset by a reduction in disease related reproductive failures, and sterilization's effects become additive instead of compensatory. We observed this tendency under the alternative contact distributions where asmaller number of individuals played a larger role in transmission. Under these conditions, nding and treating infectious individuals was more difcult and ittook more cumulative treatments to reduce seropreva- lence and kreached a minimum of 0.985 when objective levels were 100 bison per year. The high cost of treating seropositives as they become scarce in the population suggest that a more reasonableapproach for sterilization and test-and-remove would be the application of these strategies for a limited duration during the onset of a management campaign, followedby alternative strategies that require less effort, such as vaccination. In this context, management may exploit the power of treating seropositives before the costs reachprohibitively high levels. For example, our model suggested that selectively treating 50 seropositive fe- males per year for ve years would result in a meanseroprevalence of 37 %and a maximum handled to treated ratio of 7.4 for test-and-remove, and a mean 32 % seroprevalence and maximum handled to treated ratioof 9.4 for sterilization. In our simulations, mixed applications were dominat- ed by vaccination because vaccination was applicable to a broader population segment, particularly as seroprev- alence declined. Nonetheless, mixed treatments did showgreater reductions in seroprevalence than vaccination alone (Appendix B: Fig. B4). If vaccination requires direct handling and serological testing of individuals,then treatment of seropositive animals becomes more attractive (by treating test positive individuals instead of just determining them unsuitable for vaccination). Our results suggest that disease mitigation efforts can be successful with efforts that do not require treating allindividuals and may be applicable to other systems than Yellowstone bison. However, for systems that require a xed treatment area (e.g., elk feed grounds in Wyo-ming), management scenarios should account for greater group stability than what we have modeled for Yellow- stone bison. In our modeling approach, groupingbehavior and time between contact and subsequent infection (i.e., multiple seasons) supports the idea of using well mixed groups, though this assumption maynot capture group dynamics of other systems. We assumed that the probability of transmission given contact is relatively high given the massive number of bacteria expelled during reproductive failures and the attractant properties of fetal tissues in bison. While this concept is generally wide spread in the brucellosis literature, the minimum effective dose required for successful transmission remains undetermined in bison(it has not been established unequivocally in cattle,MIKE EBINGER ET AL. 2956Ecological Applications Vol. 21, No. 8either). Additionally, many factors interact during disease transmission; including bacterial dose, route,temperature, and host stress and immune responses (Cheville et al. 1998). Therefore, it is possible that the level of transmission is lower than the relatively highlevels of transmission given contact used in the model. However, indirectly, our empirical lters (seropreva- lence, proportion of seropositives that are infected, andpopulation growth rate) show that lowering of this parameter required concomitant changes in recovery ( c) and recrudescence ( x), which were not supported by the literature, for simulated disease dynamics to fall within the empirical range of data (see Methods section). Wildlife contraception is a controversial topic among wildlife biologists, managers, and the general public, which may never be free from strident debate (Kirk-patrick 2007). We feel it is important to reiterate thatsterilization in our model is used as a disease mitigation strategy and not a population control strategy. Models of sterilization for population control show that veryhigh levels of coverage are typically needed (range 50- 96%; Hobbs et al. 2000) and depend on population objectives (e.g., maintenance vs. reduction). For exam-ple, in white-tailed deer, Merrill et al. (2003) showed that to achieve a 60 %reduction in four years, a 40 % reduction in fertile females is needed each year. Ourmodel indicates that disease reduction from sterilization can be achieved with substantially smaller levels of sterilization. Nevertheless, the lifetime effect of sterili-zation, history of periodic large-scale bison culls, and the long-lived nature of bison, warrants caution in using any strategy that has the potential for reducing populationgrowth ( k)t o/C201 for any period of time. Fertility control products have several potential side effects, such as extended breeding seasons, changes inlife span, reduced genetic diversity, and alterations in social behavior and organization that should be considered prior to any management intervention(McShea et al. 1997, Heilmann et al. 1998, Powell 1999, Powers et al. 2007, Killian et al. 2008, Kirkpatrick and Turner 2008, Baker et al. 2009, Gionfriddo et al.2009, Nu nez et al. 2009, Ransom et al. 2010). Although we have no hard data documenting these side effects in bison, nor are there likely to be rigorous studies ofsterilization side effects in bison in the near future, these concerns are real, defensible, and worthy of further discussion. For now, these concerns and the intrusivehuman intervention required to implement sterilization likely limit the National Park Service's management discretion to employ sterilization given their mission andprinciples for managing biological resources (National Park Service Organic Act of 1916 and General Authorities Act of 1970; U.S. NPS 2006). However,we encourage scientists and policy makers to considerthe entire suite of available disease management tools and creatively develop effective alternatives or combi- nations that also minimize long-term impacts to Yellow-stone bison and their conservation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank J.
