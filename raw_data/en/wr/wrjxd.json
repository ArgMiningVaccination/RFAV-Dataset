The mortality could be up to 29.2%.2 Failure to detect and diagnose sepsis early is an important factor for high mortality rate. Per hour of delay in appropriate antibiotic administration, mortality rate increases by 7.6%.3 Additionally, the extended- and pan-drug resistant bacteria known as \"superbug,\" spreads rapidly globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that approximately 700 000 individuals died from infectious disease caused by resistant bacteria, and approximately 10 000 000 individuals would die due to \"superbug\" infection in 2050, which impacts more than that of COVID-19. \"Optimizing antibiotics usage and developing rapid tests\" are important issue in antimicrobial stewardship. The microbial diagnosis in the Center of Laboratory Medicine is the beginning of all our effort. However, the critical condition changed more rapidly than that of the traditional method to identify pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Resolving the problems, our team produced the first and most complete \"comprehensive anti-microbial system\" that focuses on patients with infection and sepsis. The team is composed of the infectious disease and critical care medicine-specialized physicians, laboratory medicine department, pharmacy department, information technology department, big data center, and artificial intelligence center. We organize the big data and information and use the AI prediction to help clinicians diagnose more rapidly and perform precise therapy. The \"prediction of sepsis risks and mortality\" alerts clinicians to implement measures for patients with high-risk. Clinicians could obtain information from previous pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility tests for targeted patients by \"personized antibiograms,\" and the locally common pathogens with antimicrobial susceptibility by \"intelligent antibiotic clinical decision support systems.\" Furthermore, the systems also help physicians prescribe empirical antibiotics with adequate dosage based on the weight, liver, and renal function. \"AI prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST)\" could text physicians the antimicrobial resistance prediction results earlier than that of the traditional method and allow them adjust antibiotics. We integrated the scattered data over time, AI prediction of sepsis, and AST in a friendly platform to achieve early sepsis detection, more rapid pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility identification, and appropriate antibiotics use. Based on the \"comprehensive anti-microbial system,\" our team would offer more personalized precision medicine timely with higher quality combined with gene information. The near-miss of medication dosage error was quite reduced from 2.95% to 0.79%. The report of resistance prediction was 1.4 days earlier than traditional culture report, and the mortality rate of delayed prescription of appropriate antibiotics for CRKP and MRSA infection with sepsis were reduced from 40% to 28%.  A system with data integration, predicting sepsis and antimicrobial resistance to enforce timely correct intervention and improve patients prognosis.  Using AI machine learning and mass spectrometry signals, drug resistance can be predicted, including MRSA and CRKP, as well as Colistin resistance.  Notify physicians via text about AI-predicted drug resistance from mass spectrometry signals.  The system tracks long-term trends and changes, aiding clinicians in adjusting treatment decisions with AI assistance. It facilitates real-time and seamless information exchange across various systems, devices, and applications, enabling personalized medical services and risk prediction for better care.  After the implementation of the i.A.M.S, there was a significant increase in patient survival rates compared to the previous year  With sepsis patients as the center, cross-departmental integrated teams collaborate to integrate relevant information from various systems. The information flow is smooth and not limited by systems, devices, or locations under information security protection. Based on the large data collected in the past, the team utilizes AI to predict sepsis and antibiotic-resistant strains, provide early response for clinical staff, improve patient prognosis, enhance the quality of care, and reduce medical costs.  Using AI to fight drug-resistant infections: invited speech at HIMSS 2022 APAC.  Exchanged expertise and shared successful digital transformation experiences for greater patient benefit in domestic and international forums.
