This should take the form of an entry in a course outline and a field-trip orientation in class time prior to the field trip. An entry in the course outline could be, for example, along the following lines: \"Be aware that during the field trip there will be period of strenuous hiking, hiking close to cliffs and crossing roads with busy traffic. Appropriate clothing and footwear should be worn. Further details regarding safety, food, housing and field supplies will be discussed prior to the field trip. \" The length of the pre-field trip orientation should be related to the length and/or complexity of the field trip. GP 17, Appendix B Guidance on Safety Risk from Impairment Impairment on campus and at off-campus university activities poses an extreme safety risk for both the impaired individual and other members of the SFU community. British Columbia's Occupational Health and Safety Regulation Section 4.20 prohibits employees from entering or remaining at a workplace while impaired. SFU interprets this as entering or remaining on any University Space (indoor or outdoor) and at any location where university business is being conducted. The prohibition on impairment is extended to all members of the SFU community: SFU expects faculty, staff and contractors to be fit to conduct university business, students to be fit for learning and visitors to not endanger themselves or others by means of impairment while on University Space or involved in university events or business.9 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Situations causing personal injury Occupational illness Fire, major flooding, or explosion Chemical, biological or radioactive spills/escapes/dis- charges Collapse or structural failure Motor vehicle collisions/damages Near-miss incidents (any of the above) Responsibilities Supervisors and Instructors are responsible for: 1.

Policy This policy requires the assessment of risk and the develop - ment of site-specific preventive and response procedures to protect the health and safety of, and minimize the risk to, any worker who works alone or in isolation, in circumstances where assistance may not be readily available in an emer - gency or should the worker be injured or fall ill. For individuals required to work alone or in isolation the pre - ventive and response procedures will address the identified risk(s), specify the types of activities that may be conducted, and any limitations on and/or prohibitions of specific ac - tivities, and procedures for securing assistance. Where possible, standard operating procedures (SOPs) can be developed to address similar activities within a department. Situations where an SOP may be appropriate include activi - ties such as working alone in research laboratories or offices. The site-specific policy with preventive and response proce - dures must be documented within the department, com - municated to affected individuals, and monitored to ensure compliance and effectiveness. 5. Roles and Responsibilities 5.1 Deans and Division Heads will: A. direct supervisors in their areas to develop andimplement a site-specific policy and appropriatepreventive and response procedures for workingalone or in isolation; and B. monitor to ensure the policy and measures arecommunicated, enforced and effective. 5.2 Supervisors are required to review all workplaces under their jurisdiction and: A. identify individuals required to work alone; B. identify hazard(s) and assess risk(s); C. take any necessary steps to eliminate the hazard(s); D. eliminate the hazard(s) and minimize the risk(s)from the hazard(s) by using engineering controls,administrative controls or a combination of the twocontrols; E. develop a site-specific Working Alone or in IsolationPolicy and Procedure to address the risk(s); F. communicate the site-specific Working Alone or inIsolation Policy and Procedure to all workers undertheir jurisdiction;Date March 26, 2009 Number GP39 Revision No. Rev. Dates Working Alone or In Isolation (GP 39) Working Alone or In Isolation - GP 39 1. Purpose To provide for measures to protect the health and safety of, and minimize risk to, any worker that works alone or at an isolated place of employment as defined in the Workers Compensation Act, Occupational Health and Safety Regula- tion, (Sections 4.20.1 - 4.23). Adherence to this policy will help to meet health and safety legal requirements and demon-strate due diligence in working alone or in isolation situations. 2. Scope This policy applies to all SFU campuses and to work for SFU at off-campus locations. 3. Definitions Office hours: the Simon Fraser University hours during which there are people available to help in the case of an incident. Office hours are 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at SFU Burnaby and SFU Surrey, and 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. at SFU Vancouver. Some departments have office hours that do not fall within this range. In such cases, the department must stipulate what they consider to be their office hours. Supervisor: a person authorized by an employer to oversee or direct the work of workers and students, including teaching and research supervisors, department heads, deans, manag- ers and any other persons in positions of authority. Worker: any person engaged in an occupation in the service of an employer, including faculty, staff, graduate and under- graduate students, and volunteers. Working alone or in isolation: according to The Occupa- tional Health and Safety Regulation, means \"to work in cir- cumstances where assistance would not be readily available to the worker in case of an emergency or in case the worker is injured or in ill health.\" In these circumstances extra precautions and requirements may be warranted. A variety of work environments and situations call for various inter- pretations of \"working alone or in isolation.\" For example, a worker who comes in alone after office hours to perform paperwork duties may not be considered to be \"working alone.\" A laboratory worker working alone may be consid- ered to be \"working in isolation,\" while a worker coming in after office hours to do laboratory testing with hazardous sub - stances may be considered as \"working alone.\" Depending on circumstances, situations, or environments, a site-specific Working Alone or in Isolation Policy may be required to limit individuals' duties. Worksite: any place where work is performed, including locations such as laboratories, offices, or field work. Engineering controls: the physical arrangement, design or alteration of workstations, equipment, materials or other aspects of the physical work environment to manage risk.11 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual G. ensure understanding and compliance with the Policy and Procedure; H. review the site-specific Policy and Procedure annu - ally; and I. maintain documentation of the site-specific WorkingAlone or in Isolation Policy and Procedure withineach department. 5.3 Individuals required to work alone or in isolation will: A. comply with the site-specific Working Alone or inIsolation Policy; and B. advise the supervisor of arising concerns. 5.4 Environmental Health and Safety will provide guidance and act as a resource. 6.Authority 6.1 This policy is administered under the authority of the President and all Vice Presidents.12 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual 1.0 Preamble Simon Fraser University is committed to: Reduce negative impacts on the health, safety and welfare of people; Optimize the protection of University property result - ing from emergencies and disasters; and Facilitate the timely recovery of teaching and re - search operations. 2.0 Purpose The purpose of this policy is to establish emergency re - sponse priorities and an Emergency Response Management System at Simon Fraser University. 3.0 Authority The Vice-President Finance and Administration is respon - sible for the administration, communication and implementa - tion of this policy. 4.0 Definitions Emergency means a present or imminent event that is caused by accident, fire, explosion or technical failure, or by the forces of nature, and requires prompt coordination of action of persons or property to protect the health, safety, or welfare of people or to limit damage to property. Disaster means a calamity that is caused by accident, fire, explosion or technical failure, or by the forces of nature, and has resulted in serious harm to the health, safety, or welfare of people or caused widespread damage to property. 5.0 Policy 5.1 This policy establishes the requirement for an Emergency Management Program with related procedures and plans to address emergencies and disasters. The objective of the program is intended to ensure that: A. Emergency response priorities are identified, B. The preparedness and response strategies toemergencies or disasters are established and well-coordinated, and C. Plans are in place to facilitate recovery and busi - ness continuity. 5.2 Emergency Management Program The Simon Fraser University Emergency Management Program coordinates the systems and processes for miti - gating against, preparing for, responding to and recovering from emergencies and disasters at Simon Fraser University. The Emergency Management Program is formulated by the Emergency and Business Continuity Planner in consultation with the Emergency Management Committee (EMC).5.3 Priorities In any emergency situation, Simon Fraser University's priori- ties are to: 1. Provide for health and safety of all responders 2. Save lives 3. Reduce suffering 4. Protect public health 5. Protect university property 6. Restore academic, research and administrativefunctions 7.

Providing adequate training to designated emer - gency responders; and D. Exercising procedures and plans frequently. 5.5 Emergency Response, Recovery and Busi - ness Continuity 5.5.1 Response efforts will utilize the British Columbia Emer - gency Response Management System (BCERMS). This includes the adoption of the Incident Command System (ICS) where the Incident Commander (IC) directs the site response from an Incident Command Post (ICP), and where an Emer - gency Operations Center (EOC) is activated at the request of the IC or appropriate Simon Fraser University personnel to provide coordination and resource support. 5.5.2 The EOC consists of five functions: Management, Operations, Planning, Logistics and Finance/Administration. Each function plays a specific role during EOC activation. When the EOC is activated a Policy Group will be estab - lished comprised of the President, Vice-Presidents and any other senior officials deemed essential by the President in order to provide the EOC Director with policy direction. 5.53 Planning for restoring academic research and admin - istrative functions is critical to the resumption of normal business operations. This planning begins as a component of response planning. 6.0 Scope This policy applies to all SFU campuses.Date April 25, 2002 Number GP31 Revision No. A Rev.

Lab supervisors should conduct a risk assessment of their labs and communicate th e results to those who work there. When conducting your risk assessment, please consider the following : Assess what hazards would be present in your lab during an earthquake. Pre- identify safe areas within your lab where you will try to take cover . Con sider 2-3 areas that you can quickly crawl to and that are away from : oBenches or heavy equipment that could move or shift during an earthquake oHazardous materials or objects that are not secured oBreakable items and windows Ensure wheels on equipment and c arts are in the locked position If you identify areas of concern during your risk assessment, be sure to take action to remedy problems as soon as possible. During an E arthquake: Always follow the internationally recognized Drop, Cover, Hold -on safet y technique but consider how you may need to adapt this technique based on where you are at the time of the shaking and the results of your risk assessment . If you are in a place where the bench areas have been deemed hazardous , based on the risk assessmen t, drop to the ground so you are not knocked over by the shaking and then quickly move to one of your pre -identified safe locations (i.e. the ends of the bench or to the front of the room away from windows ) No matter where you are cover your h ead and neck with your arms and hold on to a stable object in the room so you are not knocked over in violent shaking After an Earthquake: Move cautiously as objects may have shifted in the shaking and may pose obstacles to maneuvering around the room Turn off gas o r other valves (if possible these should be turned off as soon as any shaking is felt) If there are known hazardous materials in the room that may have been released during the earthquake, evacuate the area immediately but move cautiously. Move outdoors a way from buildings as aftershocks may occur . Do not re -enter the building until it has had a damage assessment and been given the ok by First Responders, Facilities, health and safety and security staff. Make sure you check in with the building evacuation coordinator/fire warden or your supervisor before leaving the area so that you can be accounted for and so they know you are safe. For more information about Earthquake Safety visit: http://ww w.sfu.ca/srs/emergency/response.html Labs at SFU are varied and therefore you must look at the unique aspects of your lab to determine the safest way to protect yourself during an earthquake. The internationally recognized approach of \"Drop, Cover, and Hold on\" should still be followed; however, moving to the end of a lab bench or to the perimeter of the lab may increa se safety during an earthquake, depending on the specific hazards present in your lab.

Proceed to assembly areaFire Emergency & Evacuation 19 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Fire Extinguisher Types and Classification Using Fire Exinguishers Use a portable fire extinguisher only when trained to do so and only on small fires. For example: A garbage can on fire or a fire, which has not yet spread beyond the immediate area. If you even have to think whether the fire is too big to be extinguished with a portable fire extinguisher, the fire is most likely too big! Rules when using a portable fire extinguisher Sound the alarm at a pull station first . Make sure you can use the extinguisher! ALWAYS keep your back towards an unobstructed exit and stand at least six feet away from the fire and follow the four- step PASS procedure (See below). A fire extinguisher only lasts for approximately 10 to 15 sec - onds. Never risk your safety . PASS Procedure PULL - Pull the Pin AIM - Aim the extinguisher nozzle at the base of the flames SQUEEZE - Squeeze trigger while holding the extinguisher upright SWEEP - Sweep the extinguisher from side to side, covering the area of the fire with the extinguishing agent. 20 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Hot plates, heat guns and oil baths can produce tempera- tures high enough to ignite combustibles. Several fires have resulted at SFU from unsafe practices when working with heating equipment. Please incorporate the following safe work practices into your risk assessment and labora-tory procedures. Mandatory Safe Work Practices Unplug heating equipment when not in use and ensure electrical cords do not come in contact withhot surfaces. When the temperature setting on heating equipmentis changed or adjusted the researcher must monitorthe temperature until the reaction mixture, oil/heatbath and equipment has thermally equilibrated. Do not heat material in a closed container unless thecontainer or vessel is specifically designed to with-stand high pressures. Always follow manufacturers' specifications. Do not use working fume hoods for storage (i.e. fumehoods that are not labelled for storage only) and usethe minimum quantity of flammable and combus-tible materials required for the experiment. Work areas must be clean and free of clutter. Familiarize yourself with the location of fire extin-guishers and the shortest evacuation route to thenearest emergency exit. Contact EHS to get trained inusing a fire extinguisher. Only use a fire extinguisherif you have been trained and the fire is small andcontained. Laboratory Hot Plates On many brands of combined stirrer/hot plates, the con- trols for the stirrer and temperature control are not easily differentiated. Care must be taken to distinguish their functions. A fire or explosion may occur if the temperature rather than the stirrer speed is increased inadvertently. Heat Guns Never leave a heat gun unattended! The heating element in a heat gun typically becomes red-hot during use and, necessarily cannot be enclosed. The on/off switches and fan motors are not usually spark-free and heat guns are designed to pull lab air into and across the red-hot heating element. This combination increases the risk of ignition. Keep a heat gun away from nearby solvents or other flam-mable materials. Oil Baths Where possible researchers should use heating mantles, sand baths or bead baths instead of oil baths. If an oil bath is necessary, care must be taken with hot oil baths not to generate smoke or have the oil burst into flames from overheating. Always monitor an oil bath by using a thermometer or other thermal sensing device to ensure that its temperature does not exceed the flash point of the oil being used. The researcher should consider requiring the use of external feedback monitoring and control of temperature (i.e., maximum temperature is set on a digital display). Equipment Keep equipment in good repair and check before each use. If you have any concerns contact the Elec - tronics Shop in room C8008 or at 778-782-3303. Seepages 18 and 19 for more information. Equipment not up to standards must be tagged andremoved from service. The equipment must only bereturned to service once repaired by a certified tech-nician and must operate according to the manufac - turers' instructions. Use the right tool for the job: Use combination hotplate / stirrers only when both stirring and heatingare required; if heating is not required use a dedi-cated stirrer.

This allows a quick calculation of how many Watts you may draw from that outlet. [Watts = Volts x Amps. W = 110 x 15 = 1650 Watts]. To be safe we should round that number down to 1500 Watts. If we take 1500 watts as our self im-posed limit and solve the above equation for Amps we can calculate that we should try not to exceed drawing more than 13.6 Amps [A = W/V A=1500/110 = 13.6]. Electrical appliances you plug in to the wall outlet will usu- ally be labeled with how many Amps the device will draw when operating. If they are not labeled, check the instruc - tion manual. If you add up all the amps from all the loads and you get more than 13, you are getting very close to overloading the outlet. Some examples are shown in the following table. Device Current, A Watts, W 17 inch computer monitor 1.5 165 typical desktop computer 2.3 - 2.8 250 - 300 electric kettle 13.6 1500 microwave oven 13.2 1450 laser printer 8 880 desk lamp (incandescent) 0.9 100 desk lamp (fluorescent) 0.3 22 Table 3: Typical loads for equipment Outlet Extension Devices or Power Bars are usually rated at 15A maximum. So all the above discussion applies. You re - ally should not attempt to draw more than 13.6A through a power bar. Electricity22 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Another error that people sometimes make is attempting to plug two power bars into the same wall outlet which commonly has two sockets. Both Power Bars are rated for 15A and they think this means they can safely draw 30A from the same wall outlet. In most cases, the two sockets on a standard 110V wall outlet are connected together and the combined total current for the two sockets together is still 15 Amps. Currents between 30 and 250mA are the most likely to be fatal. This is based on normal adult body weight. For smaller people, especially children, the effects occur at lower current levels. The effects also depend upon the path the current takes through the body. Currents passing through the heart and diaphragm are most dangerous.If a piece of equipment does not have an approved certification mark, Intert ek T esting S ervices, located in Coquitlam, can certify the equipment for a fee.

Recent changes in federal and provincial legislation have updated WHMIS, now known as WHMIS 2015, to reflect alignment with the worldwide hazard communication system known as GHS - the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemicals. Hazard classification WHMIS 2015 defines two major groups of hazards: physi - cal and health. In each hazards group, there are several specific hazard classes, which can be further broken down into categories and sub-categories, which represent levels of severity. Some classes are broken down into types. Pictograms Most hazard classes and categories or types have a pre - scribed pictogram. Pictograms relate to the severity of the hazard. For example, the hazard class Flammable liquids, category 1, 2 or 3 will have the 'flame' pictogram, but Flam - mable liquid, category 4, will not. Pictogram Hazard ClassesPHYSICAL HAZARDS Self-reactive (type A and B) Organic peroxides (type A and B) Flammable aerosols, gases, liquids and solids Pyrophoric gases, liquids and solids Self-heating substances and mixtures Substances and mixtures which, in contact with water, emit flammable gases Self-reactive substances and mixtures Organic peroxides Oxidizing gases, liquids and solids Gas under pressure - compressed gas - liquefied gas - refrigerated liquefied gas - dissolved gas Corrosive to metalsPictogram Hazard ClassesHEAL TH HAZARDS Acute toxicity, oral Acute toxicity, dermal Acute toxicity, inhalation Carcinogenicity Respiratory sensitization Reproductive toxicity Specific target organ toxicity Germ cell mutagenicity Aspiration hazard Acute toxicity Skin corrosion/irritation Serious eye damage/eye irritation Respiratory or skin sensitization Specific target organ toxicity- single exposure Serious eye damage/eye irritation Skin corrosion/irritation Biohazardous infectious materials Table 1. WHMIS 2015 pictograms and hazard classes Labels All hazardous products in the workplace must be labelled. It is also advisable to label non hazardous products in the lab to ensure everyone knows what is hazardous and what is not. A supplier label must appear on all products distributed or sold in Canada. It will include the product identifier, the product pictograms (if applicable), a standard signal word \"Warning\" or \"Danger\" , standard hazard statements, precautionary statements and the supplier identifier. A workplace label is the responsibility of the users of the product and is applied in the following situations: chemicals are transferred from their original container solutions are prepared in the lab original product label is missing or illegible The workplace label must contain the following elements: a. product identifier b. safe handling information (e.g., hazards associ - ated with the product and basic precautions) c. referral to the Safety data sheet 26 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Safety data sheets (SDSs) Previously called Material Safety Data Sheets, these are detailed technical documents created by the manufacturer or supplier of a hazardous product. Electronic or paper copies should be accessible in your lab for every hazardous product used or stored there. Each safety data sheet is valid for 3 years, so if you keep paper copies, remember to update them. SDSs follow a standard 16 section format:1. Identification2. Hazards identification3.

Education and training All SFU employees who work where hazardous products are used, stored or handled must receive training and education related to WHMIS. Basic background informa-tion about WHMIS is provided by EHS through an online WHMIS 2015 module, available on Canvas. Furthermore, all users of WHMIS products must also re-ceive training and education specific to their lab about: procedures for the safe use, storage, handling and disposal of the hazardous product procedures to be followed if the hazardous prod-uct releases/spills procedures to be followed in case of an emergen-cy involving the hazardous product. Additional training specifi c to the hazardous product and how it is used in the lab must be provided by the employ- ee's supervisor. Four key questions As a result of the training and education you receive, you should be able to answer the following questions for every product you work with: 1. What are the hazards of the product you are using? 2. How to you protect yourself from that product?3. What should you do in case of an emergency or spill?4. Where do you get more information about this product? Other symbols and pictograms You should recognize the other pictograms and symbols that may be on products in your lab .

Getting started Log in to the system, accessible online at: labhazindex.its.sfu.ca Search for your lab group and request to join. Lab groups are generally named for the Supervisor (e.g., Smith lab group.) If unsure about the lab group name, check with your Supervisor. If your lab group has not yet been created, contact your department administrator or EHS. Once a lab group is established, components are added in the following order (order is important): 1. members are added2. rooms are added 3. inventory is created Once the lab's chemical inventory has been created, then the chemical hazard door sign can be printed. What to include in your inventory? Hazardous items that should be inventoried include flam- mables, explosives, oxidizers, corrosives, gas cylinders, and chemicals causing serious health effects. Non-hazardous items, for example, buffers, salts, amino acids, sugars, and growth media, do not need to be included in the inven-tory.When to update your inventory? EHS recommends keeping your chemical inventory up-to- date on an ongoing basis (e.g., by ensuring all incoming items are entered in the inventory and all depleted or un-wanted items are removed from the inventory in a timely fashion). Keeping your inventory up-to-date provides economical and environmental benefits: it reduces chemi-cal waste and overpurchasing. What else can I do with the inventory system? It can also be used to facilitate sharing of chemicals between labs, as approved members of a lab group can search for a desired chemical elsewhere on campus, which can reduce overpurchasing and chemical waste from disposal of unused reagents. If you require only a small amount of material, use the global (all SFU or your de - partment only) inventory searches to help you locate the chemical needed. You can then contact the lab to request some. Annual Review Once an inventory is established, it must be reviewed at least annually to ensure it accurately reflects the chemicals in the lab. This review will serve as a reminder to: check chemicals with limited shelf lives; identify and remove expired or unwanted chemicals; check the integrity of all storage vessels for cracks, ag-ing or leaks; and prevent the unnecessary purchase of chemicals whichare already on hand. If you have any questions about the SFU Laboratory Hazard Inventory System, contact Catherine Peltier in EHS at cpeltier @sfu.ca. Hazard Inventory System29 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Purpose The SFU door signage program provides emergency re - sponders with information about the hazardous materials and equipment in a room so that they can plan a safe entry response in the event of an emergency. Without this infor - mation, they may not risk sending crews into rooms where the hazards are unknown, or they may create unnecessary damage to equipment and research. Chemical hazard sign This signage is mandatory for spaces that have hazard- ous chemicals. It is also used for areas without chemical hazards but who wish to display emergency contacts for the lab. Emergency contacts must be familiar with the hazard- ous materials present and the activities of the lab, and be available by phone, including during evenings and weekends. During an emergency or incident in the lab, emergency contacts will be called and asked to provide crucial information for internal and external responders. Chemicals hazards present in the lab are represented by the NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) diamond and the WHMIS pictograms. The NFPA ratings for chemicals are weight averaged and they indicate the health (blue), flammability (red) and reactivity (yellow) hazards of chemi-cals present, whereas the number in white is an indicator of quantity. Each number is on a scale from 0 (no hazard/none) to 4 (severe hazard/high quantity). How do I generate a Chemical hazard door sign? These signs are generated in the SFU Laboratory Hazard In- ventory System, available online at: labhazindex.its.sfu.ca. When does the Chemical hazard sign need to be updated? The sign should be updated whenever laboratory contacts change or when there is a significant change to the type and quantity of chemicals in the lab. At minimum, the sign must be reprinted on an annual basis. Additional signage Biohazard This orange and black sign is only for labs requiring level 2 containment for the organisms they are working with. Level 1 labs do not require a biohazard sign but must still comply with applicable requirements. Radiation This red and yellow trefoil identifies those areas containing radioisotopes. Contact the Radiation safety for more information or signage. Wet Mopping For rooms with a biohazard or radioactive sign, wet mopping will only be provided if it has been pre- arranged for a designated night, and if the wet-mop sign is displayed on that night. By displaying the wet-mop sign, you are ensuring the cleaning staff that there are no bio - hazardous or radioactive contaminants on the floors. On your designated night of each two-week period, the clean-ing staff will check your door plaque for the wet-mop sign; if no wet-mop sign is displayed on your designated night, the cleaning staff will not wet mop your lab, but they will still collect regular trash and dry mop the lab. No Entry/No Janitorial Service This sign is used to restrict access to a lab by janitorial staff. It is useful for restricting entrance due to light sensitive reactions, as well as equip - ment and safety concerns. Lab oc - cupants are responsible for managing the use of this sign, as it can be added or removed from the door plaque as needed. Note when this sign is in place, janitors will not enter the room for any reason, so garbage and recycling bins should be left in the hall for collection. Other Signage Laser, magnet, and x-ray signs are also available to slide into the door plaques. Custom Signage If custom signage is needed for a lab, contact EHS. Restricted accessService personnel (Facilities Services, Contractors, Janitors and Campus Safety & Security Services) are required to enter rooms for repair, renovation, cleaning and routine maintenance. There are rooms where immediate entry by Service personnel may pose a hazard to the individual or occupant, or may compromise specific security or safety protocols which are in place. When this sign is posted, service per - sonnel must contact the responsible parties displayed directly on the sign itself or those listed on the hazardous chemical sign (if present).

Category 2A For substances for which there is a lesser degree of evidence in humans but sufficient evidence in animal studies, or degrees of evidence considered appropriate to this category, eg unequivocal evidence of mutagenicity in mammalian cells (probable human carcinogen). Category 2B For substances for which there is sufficient evidence in animal tests, or degrees of evidence considered appropri-ate to this category (possible human carcinogen). Category 3 Excluded from the list above are IARC category 3 carcino - gens for which assessment evidence is 'limited' . ACGIH - American Conference of Govern- mental Industrial Hygienists A1 Confirmed human carcinogen The agent is carcinogenic to humans based on the weight of evidence from epidemiologic studies. A2 Suspected human carcinogen Human data are accepted as adequate in quality but are conflicting or insufficient to classify the agent as a con-firmed human carcinogen; or, the agent is carcinogenic in experimental animals at dose(s), by route(s) of exposure, at site(s), of histologic type(s), or by mechanism(s) considered relevant to worker exposure. The A2 is used primarily when there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in experimen-tal animals with relevance to humans. A3 Confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans The agent is carcinogenic in experimental animals at a relatively high dose, by route(s) of administration, at site(s), of histologic type(s), or by mechanism(s) that may not be relevant to worker exposure. Available epidemiologic stud-ies do not confirm an increased risk of cancer in exposed humans. Available evidence does not suggest that the agent is likely to cause cancer in humans except under uncommon or unlikely routes or levels of exposure. A4 Not classifiable as a human carcinogen Agents which cause concern that they could be carcino - genic for humans but which cannot be assessed conclu- sively because of a lack of data. In vitro or animals studies do not provide indications of carcinogenicity which are sufficient to classify the agent into one of the other cat - egories. A5 Not suspected as a human carcinogen The agent is not suspected to be a human carcinogen on the basis of properly conducted epidemiologic studies in humans. These studies have sufficiently long follow-up, reliable exposure histories, sufficiently high dose, and adequate statistical power to conclude that exposure to the agent does not convey a significant risk of cancer to humans; or, the evidence suggesting a lack of carcinoge - nicity in experimental animals is supported by mechanistic data.

Evacuate room and close door 2. Only in the Shrum Chemistry, South ScienceBuilding and TASC 2: Press the nearest gas shut off button on the ap - propriate side of the hallway (this shuts off all gas to that quadrant of rooms). 3. Notify the facilities service desk (local 2-3582) thatthere may be a gas leak. Or for Shrum Chemistry, SSB and TASC 2: Notify FM that the gas was shut off due to a po - tential leak and needs to be reset. 4. During off hours, call security at 2-4500 and they will contact Facilities Management. 5. Notify room occupants on that quadrant that thegas has been shut off.31 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Information 1. Advise lab occupants of the spill and evacuate the area. 2. Notify your supervisor and/or lab coordinator of thespill. Provide details such as quantity spilled andchemical name. Risk Assessment 3. Conduct an initial risk assessment to determine if: (i) building evacuation is required. If yes, pull the firealarm and call 911. (ii) external resources are required to contain and clean-up the spill. If not, continue with step 4. Clean-Up 4. Ensure the spill area has adequate ventilation to cleargases or vapours generated during the neutralizationprocess. If there is a potential for gases to concentratein the area, or if odours are overpowering, leave, markthe door, and contact security at 2-4500. 5. Wear appropriate personal safety equipment such assafety glasses, a lab coat and gloves. 6. Select the appropriate neutralizer or vapour inhibitor. Spill-X-A for acid spills Spill-X-C for caustic spills Spill-X-S for solvent spills. 7. Apply the powder around the edge of the liquid. 8. Sprinkle the powder toward the centre. With a plasticdustpan and brush, push the powder toward the cen-tre until all liquid is absorbed. If necessary, add moreneutralizing powder. 9. If cleaning up a solvent, proceed to step 13. 10. For acids and caustics, use a spatula to place a smallquantity of mixture into a beaker of water. 11. Stir the mixture and test with pH paper. The pHshould be between 3 and 10. Disposal 12. When neutralization is achieved, scoop the mixturewith a dustpan into a disposal bag. 13. Rinse the spill area with water and wipe up. 14. If uncertain about disposal, contact your supervisor orEnvironmental Health and Safety.Chemical Spill Kit Recommended items to include in a chemical spill kit: Spill Response Procedures Spill - X neutralizer for acid, caustic and solventspills Dust pan and broom 20 L plastic pail Garbage bags Disposable Nitrile gloves Safety goggles pH paper Small glass beaker The majority of these items can be purchased at Science Stores. Chemical Spill Response 15. Disposal will vary depending on the liquid neutralized.After neutralization, some liquids produce a mixturewhich can go to landfill. Other liquids retain toxicproperties and must be handled as special waste. Forexample, chromic acid can be neutralized but notdetoxified. Documentation 16. Complete and SFU incident report form. https://www.sfu.ca/srs/contact/report.html 17. If an employee visited a physician, or was absent beyond the day of the incident (due to the incident), then the supervisor must complete a WorkSafeBC Form 7.32 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Exposure Routes & Control Routes of Exposure The most common routes of exposure for laboratory chemicals include: Inhalation Dermal absorption (includes skin and eyes) Ingestion (eating with contaminated hands) Modes of Controlling Exposure Elimination / Substitution Most desirable control Can potentially remove the hazard completely Find products that are less toxic and easier to dis- pose of Ensure the safety and suitability of the product tobe substituted is thoroughly examined Example: using water based instead of solventbased Engineering Controls Usually built into equipment Can be expensive, and can take a long time toimplement Example: local exhaust ventilation, fume hood Administrative Controls Limit exposure time Implement safe working procedures for specificchemicals (EHS can assist in reviewing these foryour lab) Example: brush or dip instead of spraying Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Most common but least desirable control Does not control the exposure at the source, expo - sure is controlled at the user Limited protection Examples: respirators, gloves, safety glasses 33 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Fume Hood Safety General Guidelines for Safe Fume Hood Use At SFU, fume hood testing and certification is arranged annually by SFU Facilities Services Confirm the fume hood is fully operational before each use (ensure hood is not in standby mode and check the magnehelic gauge, indicator ribbon or the visual face velocity display). Work with the sash at the proper operating level as indicated by the sash arrows. Ensure the sash is always in front of your face and body while manipulating ob - jects, the sash not only helps contain chemical vapors but acts as a physical shield against splashes, spills, particulates and debris. Set up apparatus as close to the back of the hood as possible. Apparatus should not be closer than 15 cm (6 inches) from the front of the hood. Set up your apparatus BEFORE you begin your experi - ment, this minimizes the disruption of air currents caused by adding and removing equipment. Do not block airflow. Raise large objects 5 cm (2 inches) off the counter by placing them on blocks. Avoid rapid removal of objects or arms from the hood and never place your head inside the hood. Avoid filling the hood with excessive equipment and do not store chemicals in the fume hood. Excess clut - ter and chemicals can impede airflow. Limit foot traffic around the fume hood. People walk - ing by the hood face will disrupt the airflow. Radioisotopes and Perchloric Acid must only be used in designated fume hoods. Keep lab doors and windows closed at all times to ensure maximum hood performance and to maintain negative pressure in the room. Use only grounded (3-prong) electrical equipment NEVER bend or kneel down so low that the sash no longer forms a safety barrier between your head and the items inside the fume hood. ALWAYS position the sash between your face and your experiment. In Case of Emergency If the low flow alarm sounds, lower the sash to the designated operating level. If the alarm continues to sound, immediately stop work, turn off all equipment and close the sash. Evacuate the area if highly volatile or toxic chemicals are being used. The alarm can be silenced but do not reset it. Contact Facilities Services (ext. 23582). If a power failure or other emergency occurs (e.g., building fire or explosion within the fume hood) immediately stop work, turn off all equipment, close the sash and evacuate the building. Contact Campus Security (ext. 24500). Emergency Shower & Eyewash Emergency shower and eyewash stations are among the most important pieces of safety equipment in any lab. All laboratory workers should take the time to locate the near - est emergency shower and eyewash station and familiarize themselves with its operation. The first 10-15 seconds of skin or eye exposure to a hazardous chemical is the critical period when flushing with water should begin in order to minimize the risk of serious injury. Regulations Per WorkSafeBC Occupational Health and Safety Regula - tion Part 5, emergency washing facilities must meet the following requirements: Emergency washing equipment must be located within 10 seconds walking distance (30m) of the hazard area34 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Traditional This style of eyewash is activated by pressing the paddle forward. The paddle will remain in the open position, freeing the user's hands to hold both eyelids open. When finished, the paddle must be pulled back to the vertical position to stop the flow of water. Integrated This style of eyewash is acti-vated by pulling the horizontal bar handle forward to open the eyewash unit. As the unit pivots open, the flow of water will begin automatically and continue for as long as it re - mains open. There is no need to support the eyewash, free - ing the user's hands to hold both eyelids open. To stop the flow of water, lift the end of the unit to pivot it closed. Drench Hose This style of eyewash is usually located next to a sink and is activated by de - pressing the handle. The handle can be locked into the open position, allowing for a continuous flow of water. If the unit must be pulled closer to the user, it is recommended that a helper hold the handle to allow the user to hold open both eyelids. To stop the flow of water, depress the handle, lift the locking bar above the detent, and release the handle. Emergency Showers There are mostly two types of emergency shower on campus, though there may be others not listed here. Take the time to understand how to use each properly before an emergency. Hanging Handle This style of shower is activated by pulling the handle straight down as far as it will go. The valve will remain in the open posi-tion, freeing the user's hands to remove contaminated apparel. To stop the flow of water, push the handle straight up.Shower and eyewash must be capable of deliveringa continuous flow of tempered water (15-30 oC) for a minimum of 15 minutes Access to emergency washing equipment must notbe blocked in any way At SFU, emergency washing facilities are tested regularly by SFU Facilities Services staff. General Precautions The emergency shower and eyewash station is in place to mitigate damage after a chemical exposure event. It is by no means a replacement for proper personal protec - tive equipment (PPE). All laboratory workers should be equipped with suitable PPE and attire: Wear eye protection, preferably chemical splashgoggles Wear chemical-resistant gloves Wear long sleeves, long pants, and closed-toe shoes Before an Incident Locate the nearest shower and eyewash station Ensure there is a clear path to the shower and eye - wash station - it may be difficult to see and navigatea crowded path in the event of chemical splash tothe eyes Test the operation of the eyewash station to clearlyunderstand how it is activated Eyewash Stations Note that there are a variety of eyewash stations on cam-pus and not all types are necessarily listed here. In some spaces, an eyewash squeeze bottle is available. A squeeze bottle is only a temporary measure, providing immediate relief on the way to the eyewash facility. Take the time to understand how to use each style of eyewash properly before an emergency.35 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Integrated This style of shower is activated by pulling down the wall- mounted handle as indicated on the integrated housing. The valve will remain in the open position, freeing the user's hands to remove contaminated apparel. To stop the flow of water, return the handle to the original position. As integrated eyewash and emergency shower units have two handles placed side-by-side, take a moment to know which handle controls which washing feature. During an Incident In the event of an emergency requiring use of the washing facilities, YOUR HEAL TH AND SAFETY IS PARAM0UNT. The minimum required flushing time for eyewash and emergency shower is 15 MINUTES, but up to an hour can be required - other workers, first aid, and EHS can consult the SDS for the hazardous material to determine flushing time. In the event of hazardous material exposure makenoise, call for help, ensuring that other workers inthe laboratory know what is happening and areavailable to provide any assistance necessary A free worker should call security for first aidimmediately When using the eyewash, both eyelids should beheld open and pulled away from the eye to allowwater to rinse away any chemicals that would other - wise be trapped under the eyelids When using the emergency shower, go under the shower fully clothed to immediately begin diluting and washing away chemicals that are on clothingand contacting skin Once under the shower, begin disrobing to separatecontaminated clothing from skin Don't be modest - potential embarrassment is bet - ter than a lifelong injury from a chemical burn Some showers on campus have been equippedwith curtains; for showers without curtains, otherworkers in the lab can hold up labcoats or towels toafford some privacyPPE: Lab Coats SFU requires lab coats to be worn in labs when hazardous materials are present; appropriate laboratory coats should be worn, buttoned, with the sleeves rolled down. Be sure that your lab coat is appropriate for the hazard you are working with, contact EHS if you are not sure which lab coat is the most appropriate: Cotton-poly lab coat, for use with acids, caustics ormaterials that are not very flammable or combustible 100% cotton lab coat, for use with flammable or com-bustible materials Nomex lab coat, for use with pyrophorics, highly flam-mable or combustible materials, and large quantitiesof flammable or combustible materials Lab coats should be left in the laboratory to minimize the possibility of spreading hazardous material to public assembly, eating, or office areas. They must be cleaned regularly. For information on lab coat rental, purchase and laundering contact Science Stores.In many cases, the floor drain is not convenientlylocated to effectively remove water during emer - gency shower use - other workers in the laboratorycan use mops and brooms to clear water towardsthe drain If the exposure is localized to hands or lower arms, itmay be acceptable to rinse under a sink in lieu of anemergency shower If a sink is used, be sure to adjust the water tem-perature to a comfortable level as flushing for aminimum of 15 minutes is still required If the spilled material is concentrated strong acid orbase, the immediate addition of water from flushingcan potentially lead to burns from exothermic dilu-tion - a quick application of SpillX-A or SpillX-B toneutralize the acid or base before going under theshower can mitigate the risk of burns36 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Safety glasses/goggles must be worn whenever there is a risk of eye injury from contact with pres - surized gases, sharp or moving particles, lasers or hazardous materials. Safety glasses/goggles must meet specific safety standards that are not required for prescription eyewear. If you are a prescription eyeglass wearer, you still must wear safety glasses/ goggles over the top of eyeglasses Lens Colours Clear - Indoor: For normal indoor use. Y ellow - Indoor: for low light applications where contrast enhancement is required Blue - Indoor: for areas with high levels of yellow light (such as sodium vapour lights) Pink - Indoor: for use where contrast enhancement is required. They reduce glare from fluorescent and halogen lights without compromising colour per - ception. Tinted - Outdoor: use where glare reduction is desired. Easy for eyes to adjust between indoor and outdoor environments. Mirror - Outdoor: for use where bright sunlight and glare cause eye strain and fatigue. Standards Canada - The CSA standard (Z94.3) specifies that a quarter inch steel ball is fired at the lens and frame at 152 ft/s (104 mph). Side shields are required with the following mini - mum dimensions: 2 cm from eyeball centre to outside, and 1 cm for each of eyeball centre to top and eyeball centre to bottom edge of lens. United States - The ANSI standard (Z87.1-1989) specifies that a quarter inch steel ball is fired at the frame at 150 ft/s (102 mph). Then, a one inch steel ball is dropped from 50 inches on the lens. No side shields are specified. US Military - This standard requires that a projectile be fired at the lens and frame at 650 ft/s (443 mph). The UVEX Genesis glasses available in Science Stores meet all three standards.PPE: Glasses & Goggles Anyone who needs a respirator to do their work will re - quire annual fit testing by EHS to ensure the respirator fits correctly and provides adequate protection. Users must be clean shaven for the fit test and at any time the respirator is in use. If you believe you require a respirator in your work, contact your supervisor and ensure you have considered all possible control measures before resort - ing to a respirator. In many cases, it may be preferable to modify the work to take advan - tage of existing engineering controls, such as moving an experiment into a fume hood. If you decide that a respira - tor is appropriate, contact EHS for guidance on respirator selection. EHS will work with you and your supervisor to gain an understanding of the work being performed. There are a variety of respirator classes, each with specific proper - ties to protect the user depending on the hazards of the work being performed. Full facepiece respira - tors, half face respirators, and N95 respirators can all be fitted to an individual user using a qualitative fit test administered by EHS. Be advised that a single-stringed mask (often called a dust mask or comfort mask) is not a respirator.PPE: Particulate Respirators PPE: Gloves Gloves must be worn when working with hazardous materials in the laboratory. Not all types of glove afford the same level of protection against different chemicals. For example, nitrile performs poorly compared to latex in acetone breakthrough tests, potentially exposing the user to not just acetone but also whatever other chemicals they may have dissolved in this solvent. The compatibility charts across the next few pages pro - vide a primer on glove selection. Workers should consult reference material provided by the manufacturer of the particular gloves available as there can be variability in thickness and other properties across brands. If there are any concerns, workers should contact their supervisor for assistance in selecting the type of gloves that will afford them an adequate and appropriate level of protection. Gloves should not be worn in hallways to minimize the possibility of spreading hazardous material to public places and contaminating exterior door handles. If gloves must be worn to protect the worker transporting items between labs, one hand should remain ungloved to open doors. If both hands must be gloved to protect the worker, another worker should accompany them to open doors with ungloved hands. When possible, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize the transport of hazardous materials between labs.37 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual How to Read the Charts Three categories of data are represented for each Ansell product and corresponding chemical: 1) overall degradation resistance rating; 2) permeation breakthrough time, and 3) permeation rate. Standards for Color-Coding A glove-chemical combination receives GREEN if either set of the following conditions is met: /uni25A0The degradation rating is Excellent or Good /uni25A0The permeation breakthrough time is 30 minutes or longer /uni25A0The permeation rate is Excellent, Very Good, or Good. OR /uni25A0The permeation rate is not specified /uni25A0The permeation breakthrough time is 240 minutes or longer /uni25A0The degradation rating is Excellent, Very Good, or Good A glove-chemical combination receives RED if: the degradation rating is Poor or Not Recommended, regardless of the permeation rating. All other glove-chemical combinations receive YELLOW . In other words, any glove-chemical combination not meeting either set of conditions required for Green, and not having a Red degradation rating of either Poor or Not Recommended, receives a YELLOW rating.Simply Stated, Drops/hr Through a Glove (eyedropper-size drops) E- Excellent; permeation rate of less than 0.9 \u00b5g/cm2/min. 0 to 1/2 drop VG- Very Good; permeation rate of less than 9 \u00b5g/cm2/min. 1 to 5 drops G- Good; permeation rate of less than 90 \u00b5g/cm2/min. 6 to 50 drops F- Fair; permeation rate of less than 900 \u00b5g/cm2/min. 51 to 500 drops P- Poor; permeation rate of less than 9000 \u00b5g/cm2/min. 501 to 5000 drops NR- Not Recommended; permeation rate greater than 9000 \u00b5g/cm2/min. 5001 drops up Note: The current revision to the ASTM standard permeation test calls for permeation to be reported in micrograms of chemical permeated per square centimeter of material- exposed per minute of exposure, \"\u00b5g/cm2/min.\"Key to Permeation Rate >Greater than (time) <Less than (time)Key to Permeation Breakthrough E-Excellent; fluid has very little degrading effect. G- Good; fluid has minor degrading effect. F- Fair; fluid has moderate degrading effect. P- Poor; fluid has pronounced degrading effect. NR- Fluid was not tested against this material.Key to Degradation Ratings Why is a product with a shorter breakthrough time sometimes given a better rating than one with a longer breakthrough time?NOTE: Any test samples rated P (poor) or NR (not recommended) in degradation testing were not tested for permeation resistance. A dash (-) appears in those cases. Degradation Permeation Nitrile Sol-Vex\u00ae37-145 Sol-Vex\u00ae37-165 (11 mil/0.28 29-865 (18 (19 mm) (19 mil/0.48 mm) Neoprene/Latex Blend Chemi-Pro 224 Chemi-Pro 224 (27 mil/0.67 (27 mm) Laminated LCPTMFilm Barrier 2-100 Barrier 2-100 (2.5 mil/0.06 mm) (2.5 mil/0.06 mm) Single palm thickness is listed in both mil and metric millimeter (mm) for Unsupported Gloves. Supported Gloves are specified by glove weight, not thickness.Specific Gloves Used for Testing One glove has a breakthrough time of just 4 minutes. It is rated \"very good,\" while another with a breakthrough time of 30 minutes is rated only \"fair.\" Why? The reason is simple: in some cases the rateis more significant than the time. Imagine connecting two hoses of the same length but different diameters to a faucet using a \"Y\" connector. When you turn on the water, what happens? Water goes through the smaller hose first because there is less space inside that needs to be filled. But when the water finally gets throughthe larger hose it really gushes out. In only a few minutes, the larger hose will discharge much more water than the smaller one, even though the smaller one started first. The situation is similar with gloves. A combination of a short breakthrough time and a low permeation rate may expose a glove wearer to less chemical than a combination of a longer breakthrough time and a much higher breakthrough rate, if the glove is worn long enough. SPECIAL NOTE: The chemicals in this guide highlighted in BLUE are experimental carcinogens, according to the ninth edition of S ax'Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials. Chemicals highlighted in GRAY are listed as suspected carcinogens, experimental carcinogens at extremely high dosages, and othe r materials which pose a lesser risk of cancer.38 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Permeation/Degradation Resistance Guide for Ansell Gloves The first square in each column for each glove type is color coded. This is an easy-to-read indication of how we rate this type of glove in relation to its applicability for each chemical listed. The color represents an overall rating for both degradation and permeation. The letter in each square is for Degradation alone... GREEN: The glove is very well suited for application with that chemical. YELLOW: The glove is suit- able for that application under careful control of its use. RED: Avoid use of the glove with this chemical. Note: All numeric designations within the product classifications are denoted in minutes. /uni25B2A degradation test against this chemical was not run. However, since its breakthrough time is greater than 480 minutes, the Deg radation Rating is expected to be Good toExcellent. /uni25A0A degradation test against this chemical was not run.

For full details, refer to the federal TDG Program. Dangerous goods are solids, liquids or gases that are ca- pable of posing a significant risk to people, health, prop - erty or the environment when transported in quantity. Examples include corrosives, flammables, toxics, oxidizers, compressed gases, infectious materials and/or radioactive materials. The Guide to transportation of dangerous goods docu- ment (found on the EHS website) is available for trained faculty, staff and students. For movement of dangerous goods exempted from the training requirement, indi-viduals may use the guide for information but must also contact a TDG-certified individual for assistance. Determining TDG To determine whether a product is subject to TDG, check the Safety Data Sheet under Section 14, Transport informa-tion. Products subject to TDG will have an associated \"UN number\" such as UN1013 for Carbon dioxide gas. A TDG package will display distinctive labels associated with one or more of the 9 TDG classes. See Appendix A in the Guide to transportation of dangerous goods docu-ment for labels associated with each class. Class 1 - Explosives Class 2 - Gases Class 3 - Flammable liquids Class 4 - Flammable solids Class 5 - Oxidizing substances & organic peroxides Class 6 - Toxic and infectious substances Class 7 - Radioactive materials Class 8 - Corrosive substances Class 9 - Miscellaneous products, substances, or organ-isms Shipping & receiving dangerous goods Class 7 Radioactive materials must be received by EHS Radiation Safety personnel. For shipment of Class 7 Radio - active materials, contact EHS Radiation Safety personnel. For all other dangerous goods, faculties and departments should have a designated receiver. Goods destined for the Faculty of Science must pass through Burnaby campus Science Receiving. If you are receiving shipments, you do not require the valid TDG training certificate unless you are receiving imported shipments. You must complete all other relevant workplace safety training (e.g., WHMIS2015) for the dangerous goods you expect to receive.Hazardous Material Delivery Service A free delivery service is available for all hazardous mate - rial purchases (including stock items) made through Science Stores. Complete the requisition on the following page under \"Delivery of hazardous chemicals:\" http://www.sfu.ca/science/faculty-support/facilities-services/science-stores.html All labs are encouraged to use the delivery service, es-pecially those labs which are located furthest away from Science Stores (e.g., Blusson Hall, Saywell Hall). General pointers for the transport of chemicals If you choose to pick up your chemicals/biological ma- terials from Science Receiving or if you must transport samples or reagents between labs, observe the following precautions: preferably use a sealed primary container for yourhazardous material the container size should be as small as possibleand should not exceed 4.4 liters choose products in containers with a protectiveplastic coating whenever available either use a cart with raised edges and second-ary containment or a bottle carrier (limit of onecarrier per person) always use a carrier with a handle, even for asingle small container of hazardous material, andadd supports/cushioning if necessary ensure supports such as test tube racks or corkrings are properly sized for the items they hold use required personal protective equipment forthe material being transported (e.g., lab coat,safety glasses and gloves) but keep one handglove free to open doors and press elevator but - tons try to avoid areas and times where many peopleare gathered assess beforehand how to respond to a potentialspill along your route and consider having a basicspill kit with you If there is a spill: never leave a spill unattended,unless you require first aid. Additional points for flammable liquids Place in metal safety cans whenever feasible. Use only appropriate manufacturer supplied con-tainers. The size should be as small as possibleand should not exceed 4.4 liters. For containersexceeding 4.4 liters, prior department approval isrequired.Transportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) 43 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Proper chemical storage is a complex and challenging component of laboratory management. Poor or incorrect chemical storage practices can result in inadvertent reac - tions between incompatible materials with potential to cause chemical exposure, injury, fire or explosion. Hazardous chemical storage manual SFU's Hazardous Chemical Storage Manual is intended to promote the safe storage of chemicals by offering informa-tion on regulatory compliance and best practices for chemi-cal labelling and general storage requirements, as well as specific storage and segregation information for certain types of chemicals. This Manual applies to all faculty, staff, students and visitors at the University who will be involved in the use and management of chemical storage in labora-tories. It can be found here: http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs/research-safety/chemical-safety/chemical-storage.html General storage requirements See below for some basic storage requirements and refer to the manual for additional details: Chemicals must be stored according to chemical com-patibility such that incompatible materials do not comein contact with each other in the event of a breakageor spill. In cases where it is not practical to store incompatiblechemicals in physically separate locations, it is accept - able to segregate chemicals using glass, porcelain orheavy gauge plastic secondary containers. The second-ary containers must be compatible with the materialbeing stored and large enough to contain any spills. Ensure storage areas have adequate lighting andventilation, and are maintained at a consistent, cooltemperature. Ensure chemical storage areas do not block aisles, hall-ways, doorways, exits or emergency equipment (e.g.,eyewash, shower, pull stations, fire extinguisher). Do not store chemicals in a fume hood unless the fumehood is used exclusively for storage and is labelled assuch. Storage equipment Using specially designed equipment for storage of flam- mables, acids, or corrosives allows certain specific require - ments to be met. Equipment should be labelled with the hazard class(es) of the chemicals stored within. Flammable storage cabinets are not required to be vented and it is not recommended. Ensure safety caps (bungs) are in place over ventilation ports so as to contain/protect contents from fire. Acid and corrosive storage cabinets must be completely lined with corrosion-resistant materials and include corro - sion-resistant hardware. It is recommended that they be lo -cated below the fume hood and vented in order to prevent the buildup of corrosive vapours, which can degrade the inside of the cabinet. Fume hoods should not be used for long-term chemi- cal storage. Fume hoods which have been designated for temporary chemical storage must be labelled \"For Storage Only\" . Ordinary (domestic) r efrigerators and freezers used for chemical storage must never be used to store food (and labelled \"NO FOOD - LAB CHEMICAL STORAGE ONLY\") and must not be used for storage of flammable liquids. Specific storage requirements Storage requirements for the most common chemical haz- ard classes are summarized below. Refer to the manual for additional details related to these and other hazard classes. Note that many chemicals fall into multiple hazard classes. Consequently, it may be necessary to consult several sec - tions to determine how to store a chemical safely. Further - more, some complex substances may not fit easily into any category, in which case it becomes necessary to consult various other resources (e.g., Safety Data Sheet or SDS, literature, your Supervisor, EHS) in order to determine safe storage conditions. Flammable and combustible liquids Examples include: acetone, diethyl ether, ethanol, hex - ane, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and xylene. Store a maximum of 25 L of flammable and combusti- ble liquids in the open laboratory. Larger volumes mustbe stored in an approved flammable storage cabinet,up to a maximum of 500 L per fire compartment (i.e., alaboratory or a shared laboratory). Keep flammable and combustible materials away fromany ignition sources: heat, flames, sparks, hot surfacesand direct sunlight. Keep flammable and combustible materials away fromstrong agents, peroxides. Containers of flammable and combustible liquids mustnot exceed a capacity of 5 L. Ensure an appropriate fire extinguisher is readily avail-able in the laboratory and that laboratory occupantsare trained to use it. Flammable cabinets are used preferentially for flamma-ble liquids and if space allows, for combustible liquids. Refrigerators and freezers used for storing flammableor combustible liquids must be \"Lab safe\" or rated forflammable material storage.Chemical Storage44 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Corrosives Examples include: organic acids such as acetic and citric acids; inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydro acids; inorganic bases suchas potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. If storage space permits, acids and bases should bestored in separate cabinets, but can be stored togetherwhen segregation is ensured with secondary contain-ment bins. Segregate inorganic acids from organic acids andinorganic bases from organic bases, as a general rule ofthumb. Nitric acid is a strong oxidizer and it must be isolatedfrom other acids and stored separately from incom-patibles: flammables, bases, hydrogen sulfide, organicmaterials, metals and metal compounds. Hydrofluoric acid attacks glass and should be storedin tightly closed polyethylene, Teflon, neoprene or nitrile containers. For long-term storage, check perme - ation ratings for chosen container material. For more information, refer to the link for Hydrofluoric acid inSubstance specific procedures. Do not store corrosives on metal shelves. Use corrosion resistant bins (e.g., polypropylene) assecondary containment for spills, leaks, drips or weep - ing. Cabinets used for corrosives storage should be made ofcorrosion resistant materials and vented. Toxics Examples include: acrylamide, ammonia, aniline,2-mercaptoethanol, mercury, phenol, and sodiumcyanide. Non-volatile toxic chemicals may be stored in a normalcabinet, separate from incompatibles. Volatile toxic chemicals should be stored in a ventilatedcabinet. Ensure containers are tightly sealed to minimize expo - sure to personnel and contamination of other chemi-cals. Toxic chemicals that are acid sensitive, such as cyanidesand sulfides, must be stored in a separate location fromacids and protected from contact. Store severe poisons in a dedicated cabinet. Controlled substances have additional precautions forsecure storage. Contact EHS a cool, dry place. Some may require refrigera-tion - consult the SDS. Segregate from flammable and combustible materials,including paper and cardboard. Store separately from reducing agents (e.g., zinc, alka- line metals, formic acid).Chemical Storage 45 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Substance Specific Procedures Special precautions must be taken when working with potentially dangerous hazardous materials. Several SFU specific safe work procedures have been developed for the following materials or classes of materials: Aqua Regia Azides Compressed gases Cryogens and dry ice Cyanide Cyanogen bromide Energetic Material Engineered nanomaterials Hydrofluoric acid New Substances (Unknown Health Hazards) Perchloric acid Peroxide forming compounds Piranha Clean Pyrophoric Compounds For access to the procedures listed above, refer to the EHS webpage: https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/ research-safety/chemical-safety/procedures.html An example of the information available in these sub- stance specific procedures is shown in the following e xcerpt on working safely with perchloric acid.Perchloric acid Precautions The Chemical formula for perchloric acid is HClO4. It is a strong oxidizing agent that will ignite when in contact with organic materials. Anhydrous perchoric acid may explode at room temperature. This acid must be inspected monthly for discoloration. Fume Hood Use Perchloric acid bottles are only stored in Science Stores. Room temperature perchloric acid may be used on open (non-wooden) bench tops, however, any experiments requiring exhaust extraction may only be conducted in the designated perchloric acid fume hood located in SSB 6166. No other fume hood at SFU may be used for this acid. Please arrange with the staff of this laboratory if you must use the special stainless steel fume hood that allows the duct work and inside walls to be washed down after use. Spill Kit Transfer of perchoric acid to and from Science Stores must be accompanied by the perchloric acid spill kit which con-sists of acid neutralizer and items enabling a user to scoop the material into a metal can to be filled with water. Incompatibilities The following chemicals have been known to cause fires or explosions upon contact with perchloric acid; therefore, do not store perchloric acid with, or allow contact with the following chemicals: Acetic acid glycol ethers Acetic anhydride (paper, wood) sodium iodide Glycerine and lead oxide mixtures sulfoxides Glycols sulfur trioxide 46 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Substance Specific Procedures lGuideline for Working with New Substances that have Unknown Properties and Unknown Health Hazards Research laboratorie s frequently generate n ew su bstances that have unknown properties . The specific hea lth hazard s associated with these compound s are not known . For this reason, it is imp ortant f or laboratory personnel to c onduct t heir research under conditions that minimiz e the risk s from substanc es with both known an d unknown hazardous properties . The MSD S mu st be used fo r substances that have had their health hazards identified. All new c ompounds should be considered hazardous . This guideline outlin es genera work practic es designed to achieve risk reduction for known bu t specifically for substances tha t have unknow n properties an d unknown health hazards . Please include the following action s into your risk assessment when generatin g a new su bstance. All reagents, reacti on intermediat es, possible reaction byproducts and potential unknown substances must be c onsidered during the r isk a ssessment. If available, review MSD S http://ccinfoweb.ccohs.ca/msds/search.html Action s to take when PROPOSIN G a project that involves a new substance tha t has unk nown p roperties a nd unknown health hazards: 1.You must discuss the proposed project and new substance with your supervisor. 2.Consult other principal investigators or lab personnel who may have worked with similar material(s ). 3.If available, consult multiple published papers. Pay attention to the potential safety i mplications of subtle changes to experimental procedures (i.e. solvent, concentration, reagent (side groups, state or form) and equipment material). Subtle changes coul d bring unintended consequences. 4.Consult the EHS website to determine if a sub stance specific procedure is applicable to your research project (i.e. Energetic Materials Guide). https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/research- safety/chemical-safety/procedures.html Actions to take BEFORE you start working with a new substance that has unknown properties and unknown health hazards: 1.Scale down the synthesis. By minimizing the amount of material available, you reduce the risk and also increase the chance that if something goes wrong the situation will be more manageable (i.e. chemi ca spill or fire). When larger amounts of materials are needed, consider running parallel 'batch' reactions so one reaction does not contain large amounts of material. 2.Work in a fume hood. The fume hood should be clear of obstructions and unnecessary chemical containers. By working in a fume hood you minimize exposure to potentially harmful gases, vapours and fumes. The sash also provides a physical barrier that can protect you from splashes and debris from a minor explosion. 3.Wear personal protective equipment, this includes (but is not limited to) a lab coat, goggles and gloves Note: No single glove material provides effective protection for all uses. https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/research-safety/lab-safety/personal-protective- equipment.html 4.Assume that any chemical mixture will be more toxic/flammable/unstable than its toxic/flammable/unstable components. 5.Communicate to other lab personnel what you are doing (i.e. have your name and reaction written on the fume hood sash (including reagents and reaction intermediates) and discuss your project in a weekly group meeting). Members of your l ab group may be able to offer guidance or may need to take precautions themselves. 6.Be prepared for an accident. Before you begin your experiment know the specific actions needed in the event of an accidental release of hazardous material.

They can form explosive peroxides during concentration. acetal Test these compounds every 12 months also. They can initiate explosive conditions once peroxides are formed. acrylic acid tetrafluoroethylene acrylonitrile vinyl chloride methyl methacrylate vinyl pyridine styrene Please note these lists are not exhaustive. Check the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) of all chemicals to determine if they form peroxides and for ad - ditional safe handling procedures. Labels for Peroxide Forming Compounds Labels for peroxide-forming compounds are available at Science Stores and on the EHS webpage at http://www.sfu. ca/srs/ehs.html. Peroxide formers are required to have labels , Science Stores will put labels on peroxide formers kept in stock . Azides Azides have the chemical formula R(N3)X. All heavy metal azides, most light metal ones, and many organic azides are explosive. Picric Acid Picric acid has the chemical formula C6H2(NO2)3OH. Do not open old bottles as crystals may have formed within the cap threads, creating the potential for a shock-sensitive explosion. Bottles with less than 10% water should not be touched or moved. Other Explosive Compounds The following compounds may detonate, decompose, or explode at normal room temperature and pressure. Some are also heat and shock sensitive. Acetyl peroxide (25% in dimethyl peroxide A peroxide is any compound containing an O-O bond. Since these compounds can readily release oxygen, they are considered to be strong oxidizing agents and fire hazards. They are sensitive to shock, sparks and flames. The danger is increased when peroxide forming chemicals are concentrated by distillation or evaporation. Test Every 3 Months Test the following compounds for peroxides every 3 months, after opening, and before use. They can form explosive peroxides during storage. divinyl acetylene isopropyl and Unstable Chemicals48 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Incompatible Chemicals acetaldehyde acetic anhydride, acetic acid, acetone, etha- nol, sulfuric acid and sulfuric, acid mixtures acetylene chlorine, bromine, copper, fluorine, silver, mercury alkaline metals water, carbon tetrachloride and other chlorinated hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, halogens ammonia (anhydrous) mercury, chlorine, calcium, io - dine, bromine, hydrofluoric acid (anhydrous) ammonium nitrate acids, powdered metals, flammable liquids, chlorates, nitrites, sulfur, finely divided, organic or combustible materials aniline nitric acid, chromic acid, hydrogen peroxide bromine ammonia, acetylene, butadiene, butane, methane, propane (or other petroleum gases) hydrogen, sodium carbide, turpentine, ben-zene, finely divided metals carbon (activated) calcium hypochlorite, all oxidizing agents carbon tetrachloride diborane, fluorine chlorates ammonium salts, acids, powdered metals, sulfur, finely divided organic or combustible materials chromic acid and chromium trioxideacetic acid, napthalene, camphor, glycerol, al-cohol, turpentine, all other flammable, liquids chlorine ammonia, acetylene, butadiene, butane, methane, propane (or other petroleum gases), hydrogen, sodium carbide, turpentine, benzene and finely divided metals chlorine dioxide ammonia, methane, phosphine, hydrogen sulfide copper acetylene, hydrogen peroxide cumene flammable liquids ammonium nitrate, chromic acid, hydro - gen peroxide, nitric acid, sodium peroxide, halogens fluorine isolate from everything hydrocarbons (propane, benzene, gasoline, etc.)fluorine, bromine, chlorine, chromic acid, sodium hydrocyanic alkali hydrofluoric acid (anhydrous)ammonia, aqueous or anhydrous hydrogen peroxide cooper, chromium, iron, most metals or their salts, alcohols, acetone, organic materials, aniline, nitromethane, flammable liquids, combustible materials hydrogen sulfide fuming nitric oxidizing gases iodine acetylene, ammonia (aqueous anhydrous), acetylene, aniline, chromic acid, hydrocyanic acid, hydrogen sulfide, flammable liquids, flammable gases oxalic acid silver, mercury agents phosphorus (white) air, oxygen, alkalis, reducing potassium carbon tetrachloride, carbon dioxide, water potassium chlorate sulfuric and other acids potassium perman-ganateglycerol, ethylene glycol, benzaldehyde, sulfuric acid silver acetylene, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, ammo - nium compounds sodium carbon tetrachloride, carbon dioxide, water sodium peroxide ethyl or methyl alcohol, glacial acetic acid, acetic anhydride, benzaldehyde, carbon disul-fide, glycerin, ethylene potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, potassium permanganate (similar com-pounds of light metals such as sodium, lithium) Risk Assessment Risk assessment is a foundation of laboratory safety and allows researchers to systemically identify and control hazards . Risk assessment also contributes to improved planning and understanding of research variables and better research outcomes. Refer to the EHS website for available resources https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/research- safety/chemical-safety/risk-assessment.html Pregnancy Working with certain laboratory hazards may present risks for an otherwise healthy individual who is planning pregnancy or who is currently pregnant. These individuals, including women who are breastfeeding, should be aware that the fetus and infant may be more sensitive to hazardous exposures including reproductive toxins, teratogens, or germ cell mutagens. Some hazards may also affect the reproductive health of adults. Refer to the ESH website for further information https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/research- safety/lab-safety/pregnancy.html49 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual A significant part of working safely involves hazard aware - ness. The most frequent laboratory glassware accidents re - sult in minor cuts. More serious accidents include hazards associated with flying glass, fire, and chemical exposure. Wear safety gog-gles when working in the laboratory! Aside from injury reduction, hazard awareness can save you time (ruined reactions) and money (bro - ken glassware and ruined reagents). Glass Types Glass contains silica, an element found in sand. There are three primary glass types found in laboratories: soda lime (soft), borosilicate (hard) and pure fused quartz (99% silica). Pyrex is a brand of hard glass. Soft, hard and quartz glass have working temperatures of up to 110, 230, and 1000 oC, respectively. Hot Glass A problem with hot glass is that it looks the same as cool glass. Try to establish routines that allow hot glass to cool in out-of-the-way locations. For example, before remov - ing glassware from an autoclave, crack the door and allow the glass to cool for several minutes before handling. The use of gloves and tongs can prevent burns, but they may make handling items awkward. Preventing Cuts Heavy gloves should be worn when washing glassware by hand. Glassware cuts are more common than you might expect and can be serious. In one accident, an Iowa State University laboratory em-ployee suffered cuts to five wrist tendons. Fortunately, the cuts were shallow and the injury did not result in perma-nent impairment. Inserting glass stems into rubber stoppers, or connect - ing tubing to glass nipples (as on a side arm flask) can be made safer and easier by first lubricating the glass. Labora - tory grease works well, but even deionized water is better than nothing. Protect hands with gloves, rags, or a shield fashioned from wood or plastic. Then, with some type of hand protection, slowly work the tubing onto the glass nipple or the glass stem into the stopper.When removing tubing from glassware, do not attempt to pull it off. First lay the item on the lab bench, if possible. Cut the tubing near the end of the glass. Always cut away from your body. Next, slice the tubing lengthwise and slide the material off the glass nipple. Fittings An alternative to barbed glass nipples are threaded fittings. Plastic tubing is typically connected via a screw cap with a plastic barb fitting and synthetic \"rubber\" gasket. Several manufacturers also offer \"quick-connect\" fittings. One piece of the connector is threaded semi-perma-nently into glass. The other side attaches to tubing. The most common method of connecting laboratory glass ap - paratus is by ground-glass joints. Typically these are round (image) or tapered. Of the two types, round ground-glass joints are less likely to \"freeze. \" Frozen Joints When taper joints are used, the likelihood of \"freezing\" can be reduced by applying grease. If grease is not an option, or if solvents remove the grease, tetrafluoroethylene (Teflon\u00ae) sleeves (inset) can be used to eliminate \"freezing. \" Once a joint is frozen, try soaking it overnight. If it remains frozen, do not attempt to force it apart. It may be possible to loosen the joint with heat. A hot air gun may be used, but a bunsen burner will likely result in better outcomes. Once all flammable solvents are removed, and proper personal protective eyewear is donned, rapidly apply heat to the outer surface (try to keep the inner glass piece from heating). Working with Laboratory Glassware50 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual While heating, apply a modest pulling force on the two pieces. Tapping lightly with a wooden stick may help. If using a bunsen burner, do not heat longer than 30 seconds. If you do not have a burner or are not interested in perform - ing this procedure, Glass Shop staff can provide this service for you. Pressure / Vacuum When glass is used under pres - sure or vacuum, taking extra precautions is advised. Surface scratches are the most common defect causing weakness and breakage. Be sure to inspect glassware for small defects before applying pressure or vacuum. If possible, mechanically pressurized or vacuum pump systems should be operated in a fume hood with the sash down. Pressure-relief and vacuum-re - lief devices can reduce hazards and improve research outcomes by reducing the chance of glass breakage When working with vacuum systems outside of a fume hood, consider using epoxy-coated apparatus or tape the vessel to help contain glass in the event of failure. Where practical, use a bench-top shield. Keep in mind that round vessels will tolerate more pres - sure or vacuum than flat-sided vessels of similar construc - tion. Glass Repair Star cracks and other small defects can be \"repaired\" at the Glass Shop by annealing. Annealing is a process of heating glass to a specified tem - perature followed by slow cooling. The \"harder\" the glass, the higher the applied temperature. A more insidious glassware hazard is glass stress. Glass can be stressed when heated unevenly above its strain point. It is difficult to stress quartz glass, but relatively easy to stress borosilicate (Pyrex) glass, which has a strain point of 510oC. Additionally, thermal strain is most severe in thick glass. Glass Shop staff use polarized light to identify glass stress lines. If you have borosilicate glass that is routinely heated (e.g., distillation equipment), you may wish to get glassware checked out regularly. Annealing removes the stress, mak - ing the glassware safer and more reliable. Chips weaken glassware and may present an injury hazard. Chips and major breaks can be taken to the Glass Shop for eco - nomical repair. Before taking glassware in for repair, be sure to empty and clean each item. If acetone or other flammable solvents are used, rinse glassware with water and allow to dry. Apparatus Set-up When connecting lab apparatus, it may be necessary to clamp glass to ring stands or other supports. Care should be taken to avoid over- tightening glassware clamps as this may induce mechanical strain. Glass Disposal Used and/or broken glassware should be free of chemical and biological hazards prior to disposal. Place glass in a broken glass container. Do not dispose of broken glass in regular garbage. See next page for more information. 51 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Hazardous Waste Disposal Hazardous wastes are generated by the University through research, academic and operational activities. Environmen-tal Health and Safety coordinates the collection, consolida-tion and recycling or disposal of hazardous wastes through our qualified Waste Contractor. Hazardous waste is defined as a product, substance or organism that is no longer used for its original purpose and presents a risk or potential risk to human health and/or the environment due to certain characteristics (ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, toxicity, infectivity). Guidelines in this section do not replace the risk assessment that users must perform when work - ing with hazardous materials to determine their safest method of disposal. This section applies to hazardous chemical waste only; for other wastes, refer to: Biohazardous Waste pages 65-68 Radioactive Waste Radiation Safety Manual Segregation Many lab wastes that do not exhibit any of the hazardous characteristics (ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, toxicity, infectivity) can potentially be designated as non-hazard-ous. Examples include certain salts (i.e., potassium chlo - ride and sodium carbonate), natural products (i.e., sugars and amino acids) and inert materials (non-contaminated chromatography resins and gels). They can be disposed in the regular garbage if not contaminated. When practical and safe to do so, waste segregation makes economic and environmental sense since it can significant - ly reduce costs associated with hazardous waste disposal and prevent non-hazardous materials from being inciner - ated and/or sent to secure landfill. Liquid Waste Metro Vancouver, through its Sewer Use Bylaw No. 299, regulates waste discharges into all sewers in the district. Liquid waste is divided into Prohibited Waste (see Table 1), which may never be disposed down the drains, and Restricted Waste, which must meet established concentra-tion limits (see Table 2) in order to be disposed of through the sewer system. Prohibited wastes (as shown in Table 1) or wastes which exceed maximum concentrations in Table 2 are treated as Hazardous Waste. Note: In accordance with the BC Hazardous Waste Regulation, waste may NOT be diluted for the purpose of meeting the allowable concen-tration limits (Table 2). Flammable or Explosive waste Biohazardous waste. Refer to pages 65-68.Radioactive waste. Refer to the Radiation Safety Manual.High Temperature waste. Any liquid waste at a temperature higher than 65\u00b0C or any waste that will raise the temperature of waste enter - ing a sewage facility to 40\u00b0C or more.Corrosive waste. Any waste with a pH of lower than 5.5 or higher than 10.5 or any corrosive properties that may damage drain, building or sewer infrastructure. Table 1: Prohibited Waste:Aluminum (50.0 mg/L) Lead (2.0 (1.0 (10.0 mg/L) Zinc (3.0 mg/L) Benzene (0.1 mg/L) Total Oil and Grease (150 mg/L) Total BETX (1.0 mg/L) Oil and Grease (hydrocarbons) (15 Biochemical 0 mg/L) Suspended Solids (600 mg/L) Table 2: Restricted Waste Solid Waste Solid waste that is contaminated with chemicals or other hazardous materials must be collected and disposed of as hazardous waste. Examples include materials such as gloves (and other personal protective equipment), tubing, silica, drying agents, chromatography reagents and filter papers. Laboratory chemicals, in solid form, including sur- plus hazardous chemicals or experimental by-products, are also disposed of as hazardous waste if they exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: flammability, spon- taneously combustible, dangerous hazardous or containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For additional information refer to: https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/research- safety/lab-safety/hazardous-waste.html Common hazardous waste streams at SFU The following table indicates the common hazardous waste streams generated in campus laboratories: Category Waste Description Organic solvent wasteSegregated into halogenated and non-halogenated Aqueous waste Water based liquid waste that may have a pH that falls outside the 5.5-10.5, or contains other hazard-ous contaminants (e.g. heavy metals) Dry waste with residual con-taminantsAny material, but not limited to, plastic bags, empty bottles, plastic containers, paper towel, gloves, pipette tips, filter paper etc. contaminated with hazardous residue Surplus chemicals or experimental waste and by-productsAny solid or liquid in an appropriate means of containment, which exhibits one or more of the fol-lowing characteristics: flammability, spontaneously combustible, dangerous when wet, oxidizer, poi-sonous/toxic, corrosive, environmentally hazardous, or containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons52 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Hazardous Waste Disposal Category Waste Description Mercury waste Includes any equipment containing mercury such as thermometers, barometers, blood pressure gauges, flasks of mercury, etc. as well as materials or containers contaminated with mercury Gas cylinders Any cylinder used to hold a gas or any container used to hold a liquefied gas at or above atmo - spheric pressure Electrophoresis Gel wasteGels containing trace amounts of chemicals (i.e. ethidium bromide gel waste). HPLC/GC sample vialsSmall vials containing solutions from analysis on gas chromatography (GC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instruments Sharps Needles, syringes, blades or laboratory glass ca- pable of causing punctures or cuts Glass Waste Contaminated broken and unbroken glass waste and empty glass containers. Unknowns A chemical where the chemical composition char - acteristics are unknown Unstable/Ex - piredChemicals that have decomposed or dried into potentially unstable compounds that may react or become explosive under certain conditions (e.g. ether or other peroxide forming compounds, picric acid). Vacuum Pump OilHydraulic fluids no longer required for their in-tended purpose or are waste products Table 3: Common Hazardous waste streams Hazardous Waste Collection and Packaging It is the responsibility of the lab to use good judgment and safe practices if and when combining different wastes in a single container. Always wear PPE, work in a fume hood and allow any reaction to occur before capping waste containers. Containers Hazardous waste containers can be obtained through Science Stores. Alternatively, empty containers may be re-used for waste provided that: 1.the waste and the original container material arecompatible; 2.the original label is defaced; and 3.the waste container is clearly labeled with the con-tents. To ensure the safety of laboratory personnel, support staff, and Hazardous Waste Contractors, it is important to consider the following when collecting hazardous waste for proper disposal: Always refer to Safety Data Sheets (SDS) of the differ - ent chemicals before beginning work to be aware of thespecific hazards. Check the chemical compatibility of any hazardous wastegenerated. Do NOT combine incompatible hazardouswaste in the same container to avoid fires, explosionsand/or spills. Check that the waste container is made of a compatiblematerial. Ensure your waste container is large enough to safely col-lect all hazardous waste being generated. Use a funnel to avoid contaminating the outside of thecontainer. Do not overfill containers. Allow for expansion by fillingcontainers to 75% of total capacity. Use venting caps (available from Science Stores) for aque - ous waste bottles if it is possible for hazardous wasteto generate gases or vapours while being stored in thelaboratory. Ensure lids are secured to avoid spillage during transport. When packing several smaller containers in single box,use suitable packing material (i.e., vermiculite) to preventbreakage; ensure the use of a sufficiently sturdy outerbox. Vented caps Vented caps are designed to relieve pressure in containers while maintain their integrity against liquid leaks. The cap is designed to SLOWLY vent gas; the cap will not release pressure from an instantaneous reaction. Vented caps can be obtained through Science Stores. EHS recommends the caps when collecting different wastes in one container. Labeling Hazardous waste labels are required for hazardous chemi- cal waste being collected from SFU laboratories. Individual labels are available from EHS and Science Stores for waste streams as outlined in Table 4. Waste type Waste description Label type Halogenated Liquid WasteOrganic solvents which contain halogen atoms: chlorine (Cl), flu- orine (F), bromine (Br) tie or tie-wrap Non-halogenat - ed Flammable Liquid WasteNon-halogenated solvents which do not contain halogen atoms; including, but not limited to: alcohols (methanol, card-stock, affix with wire twist tie or tie-wrap Chemical Waste Laboratory chemicals, in solid or liquid form, or materials (i.e., gloves) that come in contact with chemicals, including surplus hazardous chemicals or experimental by-products which exhibit one or more of the fol- lowing: spontane or containing polycy - clic aromatic hydrocarbons.Green self-adhesive See next page for labels53 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Hazardous Waste Disposal All waste containers and packages must be properly identified according to the following requirements: Storage Hazardous waste should not be stockpiled in the lab but regularly removed by the Hazardous Waste Contractor. The following are guidelines to consider when storing hazardous waste: Do not store hazardous waste in high traffic areas, where the likelihood of a spill or knocking over a waste containeris higher. Storage areas must be well ventilated. Store incompatible wastes separately, so they cannot react in the event of a spill or a leak. Consult relevant SDSsfor incompatibilities. Use secondary containment to contain any spills or leaks. Fume hoods that are being used for experiments and reactions are not to be used to store hazardous waste. If afume hood is designated as a storage for hazardous waste,it may only be used for storage (e.g., no experiments orreactions), and the fume hood must be clearly labeled assuch. Solvent waste containers should be stored in flammable storage cabinets. The maximum volume of flammablematerial that may be stored outside a flammable storagecabinet is 25 liters. Flammable storage cabinets do not require mechanical ventilation if the safety caps remain in place and the doorsremain closed. If ventilation is required for a cabinet, con-tact Environmental Health and Safety.Pick up from Laboratories Hazardous waste is collected from the Burnaby, Surrey and Vancouver campuses by SFU 's Hazar dous Waste Contrac- tor, Clean Harbors, r epacked and shipped t o a licensed facility for disposal. Pick up days at the Burnaby Campus are Tuesdays and Fridays, pick up at the Surrey Campus is on Thursdays, and pick up fr om Vancouver campuses are scheduled when required. To request hazardous waste removal, complete a request through the online system at: https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work- research-safety/research-safety/lab-safety/hazardous- waste.html The following information must be provided: Identification of the waste to be picked up Quantity How the waste is being stored Location of the waste within the laboratory or work area Any specific instructions regarding accessing laboratories in restricted areas Contact information of someone familiar with the hazard- ous waste being picked up The disposal form must be submitted by 3 pm on the day pr ior the preferred collection day. Hazardous waste generators must ensure waste containers are ready for col-lection and at the designated location by 9 am on the day of collection. Hazardous Waste Contractor personnel have the right to refuse to pick up waste which is inadequately packaged, improperly labeled or in containers with visible external contamination.1.Any non-applicable labels must be removed from waste containers and packages or other- wise defaced. 2. The label must be completed in ink and clearly legible. 3.Complete all fields on the label in full (see Figures 1, 2 and 3). Where required, write full chemical name and avoid acronyms, formulas and trade names. 4.Affix the label securely to the waste container or package. Labels for halogenated liquid waste and for non-halogenated liquid waste must be secured using wire twist ties or plastic tie-wraps (cable ties). Labels for chemical wastes are self- adhesive. 5.Peroxide forming chemicals which are being collected for disposal must also be labeled as required for peroxide-forming compounds. For more detailed information on peroxide-forming compounds, consult: https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/ research-safety/chemical-safety/procedures.html54 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Chemical Containers and Glass Waste Disposal Protocol SFU does not recycle chemical containers and laboratory glass waste. All chemical containers and glass waste contaminated with hazardous material must be TRIPLE rinsed prior to disposal and the washings disposed of through the appropriate waste stream. Glass waste contaminated with infectious material must be either autoclaved or soaked in bleach for an appropriate contact time prior to disposal. The non-contaminated glass waste is then accumulated in the lab as outlined below and disposed in a landfill by SFU janitorial services. If you are unsure about the appropriate disposal method for glass wast e contaminated with radioactive material, please contact Jutta R.-Haunerland (Radiation Safety, 23506) For all other contaminated glass waste that poses a risk of injury when rinsing or decontaminating, please contact Catherine Peltier (EHS, 28633) . Glass and Plastic Chemical Containers 1.Glass and plastic chemical containers must be TRIPLE rinsed with water or other suitable solvent and air dried in a fume hood to ensure that it is free of liquid or other chemical residue before disposal. 2.If the glass or plastic chemical container's rinses are classified as hazardous, the washings should be collected and disposedof as hazardous waste. 3.Remove or deface all labels and hazard warnings on thecontainer. Small (< 4 L) glass containers should be placed inside the plastic liner of the glass waste cardboard container (provided by SFU janitorial services) . Large ( 4 L) glass containers should have the label removed or defaced and marked \"DISPOSE\" . Place glass containers on floor beside the glass waste cardboard container (4L bottles take up a lot of space in the glass waste cardboard container). All plastic containers should be placed in the garbage can. Other Laboratory Glassware Laborato ry gl assware N OT contaminated with biological, radioactive, or chemical hazard s should be disposed of by placin g inside th e plastic liner of the glass wast e cardboard contain er (e.g., broken gl ass, pipettes, slides, beak ers, vials) . Pick-Up Procedures When th e glass was te cardboard container is full, tie bag and close cardboard lid. Send a request for pick up to https://fmrequests.sfu.ca . SFU janitorial services will leave a new waste container when the full one is removed. If you are unsure of the appropriate disposal method, please contact Catherine Peltier (EHS, 28633). 55 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Lab Decommissioning Purpose A process of decommissioning is necessary for laboratories that are changing hands, are vacated or are undergoing renovations. Decommissioning provides assurance that chemical and biological health and safety hazards are minimized for all personnel involved. Application Decommissioning applies to the preparation of equipment for moving or servicing and to full or partial renovations of a laboratory including but not limited to any room where chemical, biological, or radioactive materials were handled or stored. Responsibilities Principal Investigator - Ensures that all applicable lab equipment and surfaces have been cleared of chemical, physical, biological and radiological hazards; reviews and completes the Decontamination Checklist, if applicable, and signs a Laboratory Clearance Notice or Equipment Clearance Notice; ensures emergency equipment such as eye wash stations, safety showers and fire extinguishers remain operational during the decommissioning and/or move. Lab Administrator or Designate - Conducts a final inspec - tion and signs the Laboratory Clearance Notice or Equip - ment Clearance Notice; notifies EHS prior to the lab being cleared and at the time of final inspection; ensures a copy of the Laboratory Clearance Notice or Equipment Clear - ance Notice is left with the equipment or lab. Decommissioning guide and checklist For the detailed guide to decommissioning, the checklist and the clearance notices, refer to the EHS webpage: https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/ research-safety/lab-safety/lab- decommissioning.html56 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Cryogens used on Campus Cryogenic liquids are materials with boiling points of less than 73 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F). Examples for cryogenic liquids used on campus are: Liquid Helium -269 C Liquid Nitrogen -196 C Solid Carbon Dioxide Dry Ice -78 C Remember your ABC's... The primary hazards of cyrogenic liquids are Asphyxiation, Boom (pressure buildup) and Cold (ABC). Asphyxiation Adequate ventilation is essential when working with cryogenics. A small amount of cryogenic liquid can rapidly convert to a large volume of gas and create a breathing hazard, and in the case of hydrogen, an explosive mixture. After a recorded double fatality where the victims did nothing to escape or attract attention, safety engineers identified the following physiological stages associated with reduced oxygen: 1st Stage Oxygen reduced from 21 to 14 percent by volume - The breathing volume increases, the pulse rate is accelerated, and the ability to maintain attention and think clearly is di-minished. Muscular coordination is somewhat disturbed. 2nd Stage Oxygen reduced to between 14 and 10 percent by volume - Consciousness continues, but judgment becomes faulty.Severe injuries may cause no pain. Muscular efforts lead torapid fatigue. Emotions, particularly ill temper, are easilyaroused. 3rd Stage Oxygen reduced to between 10 and 6 percent by volume - Nausea and vomiting may occur. Victim loses ability toperform any vigorous muscular movements or even tomove at all. Up to this stage, or even in it, the person maybe unaware that anything is wrong. Then his legs give way,leaving him unable to stand, walk, or even crawl. This isoften the first and only warning and it comes too late. Thevictim may realize that he/she is dying, but he/she doesnot greatly care. It is all quite painless. Even if resuscitationis possible, permanent damage to the brain may result.4th Stage Oxygen reduced below 6 percent - Respiration consists of gasps, separated by periods of increasing duration. Con-vulsive movements may occur. Breathing then stops but the heart may continue to beat for a few minutes. Hazards As can be seen from the descriptions, any reduction in the normal content of the oxygen in the breathing atmo - sphere must be considered a hazard. In sudden asphyxia, such as that from inhalation of pure nitrogen, uncon-sciousness is immediate. The individual falls as if struck on the head and may die in a few minutes. If a person be - comes groggy or loses consciousness because of displaced breathing air, get the person to a well-ventilated area im-mediately. If breathing has stopped, apply CPR. Whenever a person loses consciousness, call a doctor immediately. Where cryogenics are used, a hazard assessment is re - quired to determine the potential for an oxygen-deficient condition. Controls such as ventilation and/or gas detec - tion systems may be required to safeguard personnel. BOOM- Pressure Buildup Venting Containers or pipes containing cryogenic gases need to be vented to limit pressure buildup. LHe, LN2 and dry ice all expand by a factor of about 1000 upon warming . If confined this would lead to pressures of up to 15,000 psi ... BOOM. Beware of warming up of cryopumped materials. Ice and Air Plugs Never leave a dewar open to the air. Liquid Helium can freeze air and cause a plug in the dewar neck leading to pressure buildup. Ice plugs can also form in liquid nitrogen dewars. Water Water can freeze valves and vents when dewars are repeat - edly used. This is caused by frost building up and melting, causing water to run into the valve stem. If this occurs and the valve is stuck open, vent the dewar to relieve pressure. Oxygen Enrichment Oxygen in the air will condense on to liquid nitrogen cooled surfaces. Collection of liquid oxygen in organic insulation results in an explosive mixture. Cryotrapped organic compounds mixed with oxygen from an air leak creates an explosive mixture. Liquid oxygen-methane mix - tures can be detonated with light. As liquid air evaporates it becomes enriched in oxygen. Liquefied Gases and Cryogenic Liquids57 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Cold Contact with cold surfaces can cause cryogenic burns. Cryogenic Burns: Immediately place affected part in warm water bath (40-46\u00baC) and get help! Contact with cryogrenic gases can occur from splashing when the cryogenic liquid boils. The vapor that boils off from a liquid can cause the same problems as the liquid itself. Never allow any unprotected part of your body to touch uninsulated pipes or apparatus . Pour slowly to avoid splashing and stand clear of boiling or splashing liquids There are two types of boiling which can cause uncontrol-lable movement of the cyrogenic liquid: Vigorous boiling Occurs on contact with room temperature objects (mostly for liquid nitrogen). Film boiling Room temperature objects are so hot that liquid nitrogen does not wet them but rather floats on a film of nitrogen vapour. There is no friction, and the heat transfer rate is moderate until the liquid wets the surface. Note: wet objects, don't stick your tongue on the tracks. Low temperature baths (dry ice acetone): No gas film forms so cold liquid sticks to your body. Embrittlement of Structural Material Cold can also cause the embrittlement of structural materi-als. Materials that are pliable under normal conditions can become brittle at low temperatures. Rubber hoses can shatter so ensure you will not be hit with liquid nitrogen if the hose breaks or falls off. High pressure cylinders may explode if cooled. Superconducting Magnets: Large forces on ferromagnetic objects (Iron) A magnet quench can boil all of the liquid helium releas-ing large amounts of cold gas.Personal Protective Equipment must be worn when handling cryogenic liquids Goggles and face shield: Wear eye protection for the job, chemical splash goggles and a face shield are recommend-ed when handling cryogenic liquids. Gloves: Gloves must be insulated, impervious to the fluid being handled, and loose enough to be tossed off easily in case the cryogenic liquid becomes trapped close to the skin. Never wear tight gloves when working with cryo - genic liquid. Footwear: High top shoes recommended, you don't want liquid nitrogen soaking into your socks. Dewar Recommendations Given that large Dewars are heavy enough to cause signifi- cant injuries if they tip over, it is recommended that: 1. When moving a wheeled Dewar along a route which will present a tipping hazard the use of no fewer than two personnel to maintain the stability of the Dewar. 2. For future purchases of Dewars larger wheels and wider bases should be selected if possible. Acknowledging that there is a significant risk of asphyxia- tion by the large volumes of gas contained in these Dew - ars, it is recommended that: 1. If more than 1 liter of cryogen (He, LN2 or Dry Ice) per 20 m^3 of air volume is evaporated than precautions mustbe taken to prevent the creation of an Oxygen depletedatmosphere. 2. If more than 0.1 liter of Dry Ice (CO2 ) per 20 m^3 of air volume is evaporated than precautions must be taken toprevent Carbon Dioxide poisoning. 3. Due to the small air volume in an elevator and the restricted access, no actively venting Dewars should bemoved in an elevator. Also, the liquid and gas valves mustremain closed while in the elevator. Small wheels can be - come lodged in the gap at the elevator threshold. so whenloading the Dewar on the elevator, carefully pull the Dewarso that one wheel passes the gap at a time. 4. Two people are required when moving a Dewar by elevator. After the Dewar is placed inside, the first personshould remain outside the elevator and send the elevatorto the receiving floor. The second person is stationed at thereceiving floor to remove the Dewar. Additional signage isrecommended to restrict access while the Dewar is movingbetween floors. 58 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Cryogenic vial safety An incident involving the explosion of several cryogenic vials is an important reminder that personnel working with cryogenic vials wear the necessary PPE, i.e. cryo - genic gloves, lab coat, safety glasses (not prescription eye glasses), and a full face shield with neck protection. Cryogenic vial specifications Cryogenic vials should be internally threaded with a silicone gasket (do not over tighten). Glass vials should not be used. Source: Corning website Storage of cryogenic vials in liquid nitrogen Dewars Cryogenic vials should be stored in the gas phase of the liquid nitrogen storage Dewar. Storage by immersion in liquid nitrogen is not advised as liquid can enter the vi-als and when the vials are removed from the Dewar and warmed up, the liquid nitrogen will expand by a factor of 700 times. Over pressurization of the vial resulting in an explosion could occur. Source: Columbia University If vials require storage in the liquid phase ensure that vials are sealed in CryoFlex tubing (cryogenic heat shrink tub - ing) Retrieval and thawing of cryogenic vials Cryogenic vials stored in the liquid phase of the liquid ni- trogen storage Dewar should be moved and stored in the gas phase of the Dewar for at least 24hr - 48hr to allow for any liquid nitrogen inside the vial to evaporate.If feasible (based on pathogenicity of the material), loosen the lid on the cryogenic vial immediately after removing the vial from the liquid nitrogen storage Dewar. Thawing of cryogenic vials should take place immediately in a thick-walled container or a fume hood or biosafety cabinet. It is reccomended that cryogenic vials are not reused. Cryogenic vial safety59 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Compressed Gas Cylinders Compressed gas cylinders are very heavy. Don't become injured trying to stop a cylinder from falling. Stand back and let it fall. Purchase of Cylinders Before purchasing cylinders, check your lab's current in- ventory to prevent unnecessary stockpiling. Do not accept a gas cylinder that does not identify its con- tents legibily by name. Transporting Cylinders The cap must be on while transporting. If the valve is knocked off of a full cylinder it will take off like a rocket. Do not drag, roll or slide gas cylinders, they must be trans- ported on a specially designed cart, with retaining straps or chains. Storage of CylindersThe following general precautions should be taken when storing compressed gas cylinders or lecture bottles: Always label cylinders with their contents; do notdepend on the manufacturer's color code. Theymay vary across companies. Cylinders must always be securely restrainedSecurely strap or chain gas cylinders to a wall orbenchtop. In seismically active areas, use morethan one strap or chain. EHS recommends usingtwo restraints chains at the levels of 1/3 and 2/3the height of a K sized cylinder. When cylinders are no longer in use, shut thevalves, relieve the pressure in the gas regulators,remove the regulators, and cap the cylinders. Segregate gas cylinder storage from the storageof other chemicals. Do not store corrosives near gas cylinders or lec - ture bottles. Corrosive vapors from mineral acidscan deface markings and damage valves. Keep incompatible classes of gases stored sepa-rately. Keep flammables away from reactives,which include oxidizers and corrosives. Segregate empty cylinders from full cylinders. Keep in mind the physical state\u2014compressed,cryogenic, or liquefied\u2014of the gases. Store compressed gas cylinders in a cool, dry area,away from flammable materials, sparks, flames,excessive heat, and sources of potential physicaldamage, electrical contact or corrosion The protection cap should be left in place until the gas cylinder is secured and ready for use. Removing the cap Be careful not to open the valve when removing a tight cylinder cap. CGA Fittings There are a large number of different connections used on the cylinders and regulators. These connections vary in diatmeter, some are male and some are female, and some are right-handed threads and some are left-handed threads. This is done to prevent mixing of incompatible gases or the use of unsuitable regulators. Venting The system should have a properly vented relief valve. Vent pressure-relief devices protecting equipment that is attached to cylinders of flammable, toxic, or otherwise hazardous gases to a safe place. Sudden Release Would you be safe if there was a sudden release of gas? Know what hazards the gas presents Is it t oxic? F lammable? R eactive? Adiabatic Compression & Oxygen/Reactive Gas Hazards Never allow any lubricant to contact with compressed oxygen. Open valves slowly, high velocities or rapid compression of the gas in the pipe can ignite the tubing (even stainless steel). Compressed Gases & Gas Regulators60 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Hydrogen requires special care due to its wide flammabil - ity limits. Never lay an acetylene cylinder on its side. Consult the Praxair catalogue for more information on the specific hazards of the compressed gas you are working with. http://catalogs.praxairdirect.com/i/34012/47 Pressure Regulators Pressure regulators are required to reduce a high-pressure supplied gas to a desirable lower pressure and to main - tain a satisfactory delivery pressure and flow level for the required operating conditions. Under no circumstances should oil or grease be used on regulator valves or cylinder valves because these substanc - es may react with some gases (e.g., oxygen). With the regulator in hand, make certain the pressure adjustment knob is turned counterclockwise as far as it will go. Make sure the on-off valve is in the off position. Tighten the regulator onto the cylinder with a wrench, using no more force than you can exert with two fingers on the end of the wrench. Stand to the side so that you are not in front of or behind the pressure gauge. Slowly open the cylinder valve, a quarter turn at first, until steady pressure is shown on the inlet gauge . Then open the valve all the way and back it off a half turn. In that way, someone can later sense the position of the valve. A valve that's open all the way feels the same as one that's stuck in the closed position. (Acety - lene cylinder valves are opened only a quarter turn and no further). Turn the pressure-adjusting knob slowly clock - wise until the desired delivery pressure is observed on the process pressure gauge. Check the entire regulator, including the gauge connec - tions, for leaks. If leaks appear, turn off the cylinder, repair the leaks, and turn it on again. If the body of the regulator leaks, call your supplier. Fully open the on-off valve. Check all downstream fittings, including the on-off valve. Do not tamper with the packing nut on the on-off valve. Only a qualified mechanic should do any repairs to the pressure regulator. To shut down the system, first turn off the cylinder or the main cylinder valve. Allow the pressure gauge to vent, then back out the adjusting valve counterclockwise and, fi - nally, slowly disconnect the cylinder valve and the system. Slowly disconnect the process or instrument fitting. Slowly remove the regulator from the cylinder, bearing in mind that a small amount of gas might be trapped in the fitting. Recap the cylinder. What is the difference between a Single Stage and Two Stage regulator? Single-stage pressure regulators reduce the cylinder pres - sure to the delivery or outlet pressure in one step. Two- stage pressure regulators reduce the cylinder pressure to a working level in two steps. The best recommended action is to determine how you intend to use the pressure regulator. Generally a single- stage regulator is good for short duration applications; a two-stage regulator is good for long duration applications, such as gas chromatography. Two-Stage regulator Single Stage Regulator Note: The output of a single stage regulator will rise as the tank drains. Disposal of cylinders Do not abandon cylinders in the dock storage areas. Return cylinders to the supplier when you are finished with them, for more information contact Science Stores. 61 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Laboratory Safety Training Biosafety 62 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines 3rd Edition, 2004 (PHAC) Containment Standards for Veterinary Facilities 1st Edition, 1996 (CFIA) Containment Standards for Laboratories, Animal Facili-ties and Post Mortem Rooms Handling Prion Disease Agents, 2005 (CFIA) CFIA also regulates use of plants with novel traits (PNT), e.g., transgenic plants as well as aquatic animal pathogens Know Which Risk Group you are Working with If the organism is already in the lab, your supervisor should know the risk group, because it is on the permit. PHAC has created Pathogen Safety Data Sheets for many Level 2 to 4 organisms. See www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/ res/psds-ftss/index-eng.php If it isn't on that list you must ask the Public Health Agency of Canada - email: biosafety_biosecurity@phac-aspc.gc.ca For a good guess, or to know where it stands in the USA (for import purposes) check with the American Type Cul- ture Collection website: www.atcc.org. However the official regulations are in the websites of the CDC and NIH (www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbls/index) You will need import permits from PHAC and/or the CFIA to purchase or receive any level 2 organism (or soil) from outside of Canada. You need to follow special packaging instructions to ship one of your strains to a colleague, and follow international rules for level 2 and up. Material transfer agreements may also be required (even for UBC). Pathogen Safety Data Sheets These can be found for microorganisms of risk level 2 and above, on the PHAC website at: www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab- bio/res/psds-ftss/index-eng.php These are designed with the safety of laboratory workers in mind, and list such useful information as: symptoms of infection, mode of transmission, infectious dose (how many organisms it takes to start an infection), host range, incubation period, which disinfectants work, whether heat treatment kills the organism, and how to clean spills. Risk Group Individual Risk Community Risk 1 Low Unlikely to cause disease in healthy workersLow [e.g. many E.Coli types] 2 Low Can cause disease that is easily treatableLow Not easily spread [e.g. Legionella spp.] 3 High Can cause serious disease that is treatableLow Not easily spread by casual contact [e.g. Bacillus anthracis.] 4 High Can cause serious, often untreatable diseaseHigh Is easily transmitted by casual contact [e.g. Ebola.] Biosafety Permits SFU has a Biosafety Policy R 20.02 to ensure the safety of students, faculty, staff, the community and the environment when using biohazardous materials under the auspices of Simon Fraser University, and to facilitate research, teaching and testing in compliance with the applicable regulations and standards If you are working with a biohazard, your supervisor must have a permit issued by the university Biosafety committee that lists that hazard and describes the work. Before you start the work (or obtain the organism) the permit must be approved. For information about permits, please see the EHS website: https://www.sfu.ca/srs/work-research-safety/research- safety/biosafety/permits.htmlWorking with Biohazards Biohazards Biohazards are defined as biological agents and materials which are potentially hazardous to humans, animals and other forms of life. T hey i nclude known pathogens and infectious agents including bacteria and t heir plasmids and phages, viruses, fungi, mycoplasmas, and p arasites; cell lines, animal remains, and laboratory animals including insects which might harbor s uch infectious agents; and primate body fluids. Also included a re potentially biohaz- ardous organisms used in procedures such as recombinant DNA and genetic manipulations. Biohazards w ill be classi- fied according to risk l evels requiring appropriate contain- ment. Regulatory Agencies The Human Pathogens and Toxins Act (HPTA) (2009) \"establishes legal prohibitions and authorities to govern human pathogens and toxins in Canada. It is designed to protect the health and safety of the public against the risks posed by human pathogens and toxins, while allowing sci- ence and research to progress.\" The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) released the 2nd edition of the Canadian Biosafety Standards (CBS). The CBS 2nd edition , 2015, replaces the following bio- safety standards and guidelines for human and terrestrial animal pathogens:63 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Working with Biohazards continued Personal Protective Equipment is the last line of defense against exposure to hazardous materials. It should only be worn if all other exposure control strategies (e.g., elimina- tion/substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls) are not effective in reducing exposure. If you have any questions regarding the selection of appropriate personal protective equipment, please contact Binab Karmacharya at 604-762-0676. Types of Personal Protective Coats 4.Appropriate footwear 5.Respirator PPE: Lab Coats SFU requires lab coats to be worn in labs when hazard- ous materials are preesent; appropriate laboratory coats should be worn, buttoned, with the sleeves rolled down. Be sure that your lab coat is appropriate for the hazard you are working with, contact EHS if you are not sure which lab coat is the most appropriate. Lab coats should be left in the laboratory to minimize the possibility of spreading hazardous material to public assembly, eating, or office areas, and clean them regularly. For information on lab coat rental and laundering contact Science Stores. PPE: Safety glasses/goggles, gloves and Respirators See pages 42 to 47. Working with Risk group 1 organisms in the Research Laboratory If it can't hurt me, why do I need to be careful? 1.If you culture an organism, the concentration andpotential dose to you can be very high, perhaps 10 9 microorganisms/ ml. 2.Microorganisms may gain direct entry to the bodyduring a laboratory accident.3.You may not be growing the intended CL1 organ-ism, but a pathogenic contaminant. 4.Some organisms are not fully characterized andpose unknown hazards. 5.Precautions must be increased above those taughtin this course when working in a large scale, (>10L)even with a well characterized organism. There areexcellent books in the SFU library on this topic. Consequences of Exposure to Biohazards How about illness and death? Infections from 1. Microorganisms under study (plague). 2. Microbial contamination of other biological samples (viruses in tissue culture). Poisoning from microbial toxins (botox).Allergies many toxins and some organisms are allergenic (mold allergy).Use Personal Protective Equipment64 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Statistics on Laboratory Accidents Only 20% of the time was exposure obvious to the worker Wounds: scalpel nicks, culture tube breaks, opening freeze-dried ampoules. Ingestion: mouth pipetting, dirty hands touch mouth, pen in mouth, coffee cup on lab bench where it can be splashed (all can be easily avoided). Injection: needle sticks while injecting animals with organisms, or recapping a used needle. Inhalation: dropped flask, splashes while pouring, heat-cracked glassware, lid off centrifuge tube, exploding cryovials. Eye contact: splashes, hand to eye, or aerosols. Some organisms enter via the conjunctivae. Other 80% of the time exposure was less obvious to the worker Small aerosols: entry is the same as above, but less expected to have caused a problem, small aerosols are encountered during many routine procedures such as: flaming a loop with culture on it careless loading of autoclave bags pouring supernatant from a centrifuge tubes pipetting up and down, or ejecting pipette tips loading slides with culture, catalase test (bubbles) opening tubes or petri dishes where the caps havebeen wetted Inadequate hand washing Minor skin abrasions: cuts, dermatitis, eczema, the skin does not provide a proper barrier to organisms in these situations. Poor technique: can spread biohazards beyond the im- mediate work area via spills on racks, pens, lab books and from there onto desks and bench tops. As most organisms are viable on surfaces, they can affect co-workers, custodi-ans, or even those who we live with. Immune Status Fortunately, your immune system can generally handle small exposures in the lab. However, some of your co-workers could have suppressed immune systems: e.g, pregnant women, those with mononucleosis, those being treated with steroids and those undergoing cancer treat - ment.Biohazard Exposure Control Plan Exposure Splash to face or eyes 1.Advise lab occupants 2.Rinse for 15 minutes with water at eye-wash station 3.Remove contaminated clothing or lab coats for autoclaving (fold them inwards) 4.Proceed with emergency treatment below Needle sticks or cuts 1.Advise lab occupants 2.Wash with soap and water 3.Apply a bandage if necessary 4.Proceed with emergency treatment below Emergency treatment If worker cannot move, call 911 If possible, retain the product causing the exposurefor testing purposes Proceed to SFU health services in the Maggie Ben-ston building (open Monday-Thursday 8:30 - 5:30and Fri 8:30-4:30). Otherwise, attend the Emergency Room at Royal Columbian 330 East Columbia, New Westminster Burnaby General 3935 Kinkaid, Burnaby Eagle Ridge 475 Guilford Way, Port Moody Indicate to the Admitting Clerk the possibility of a biohazard infection Provide personal history to the health nurse Blood may be examined, and a physician may rec - ommend anti-viral pills Further blood work and counseling may be re - quired throughout the year Have your supervisor complete a WorkSafeBC Form7, and an SFU incident report Vaccinations If you suspect you will be working with a virus for which a vaccine is available, you may be entitled to have the cost of your vaccinations covered by your department. You will be required to acknowledge that a vaccine has been made available to you.Biohazard Exposure Routes Exposure Control Plan65 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Reduce or Contain Aerosols 1.Dry contaminated metal inoculating loops before flaming or use plastic loops. 2.Spread and pipette in a controlled manner. 3.Mix by vortexing where possible. Use tightly closedcaps on tubes. 4.Cap all solutions for the centrifuge and do notoverfill. 5.Sonicate cells in a biosafety cabinet. 6.Carry tubes and flasks in the proper racks, or ontrays. 7.Contain dry spores by working on a damp mat in abiosafety cabinet. Discard waste into a sealed con-tainer, such as a Ziploc bag, before adding to (open)biohazard bags. 8.Use a biosafety cabinet (never a laminar flow hood)when aerosols are generated. 9.Use a properly fitted respirator, if none of the abovewill provide adequate protection. Reduce the Spread of Biohazards 1. Keep required waste containers in your immediatework area. 2. Disinfect or use secondary containment for anybiohazardous materials that may leave the labs.This could be anything from wastes to equipmentthat may leave the lab for repair. Avoid Injection Injuries 1. Use syringes/ needles only when no other method of transfer will work. 2.Use Safety Engineered Sharps (SES) when pos-sible and NEVER Recap needles; discard in the red plastic biohazard sharps containers with thesyringe attached. 3. When opening sealed glass ampules containingbiohazardous materials, score the glass with a file,wrap the vial in paper towel and wear sturdy glovesbefore breaking the ampule. 4. When working with pipettes insert the pipette intoa pipette-aid or bulb, by grasp the upper part of thepipette. Plastic pipettes are safer than glass. 5. Use proper glass test tubes if working with patho - gens; not disposable glass which has a greaterprobability of breakage. Disposable plastic culturetubes are safer then glass.Glass Waste Broken glassware, glass tubes, vials, ampoules, Pasteur pipettes, microscope slides and microscope cover slips contaminated with biohazards should be autoclaved or bleached in a sturdy means of containment, then disposed of with regular broken glassware (see page 28 ). If it's not possible to safely decontaminate, dispose of the glass in the appropriate biohazardous sharps containers, as per risk group (RG) level. Glass waste contaminated with RG1 material would be treated as Biohazardous Level 1 sharps waste and glass waste contaminated with RG2 material would be treated as Biohazardous Level 2 sharps waste. Please see the \"sharps container table\" on page 68 for more information. Microscope slides with fixed material are no longer bio - hazardous and can be disposed of with regular broken glassware (see page 28). If the material is live/frozen then the slides are still considered biohazardous. If the mate - rial is not sealed behind the coverslip, the slides may be autoclaved or bleached. If the material on the slide is sealed, then the slides may be disposed of in an appropri-ate biohazardous sharps container, as per RG level. Liquids Liquids can be autoclaved or bleached (all bleached to 20% v/v), allow for off-gassing to occur in fumehood. If liq-uids are to be aspirated into a trap, the pump or aspirator must be protected by a secondary trap and/or autoclav - able in-line filter Nucleic Acids Microorganisms in the environment are capable of incorporating genes from naked nucleic acids. Many of the genes that researchers work with at SFU are poten-tially harmful in the environment (e.g., antibiotic resis-tance genes, pathogenicity genes and transgenic plant genes). The safest policy is to dispose of nucleic acids as biohazardous materials. The flow chart on the following page should be followed for disposal of nucleic acids on campus.

These protocols are specific to SFU and have been implemented to prevent adverse ecological and environmental impacts attributed to poor hazardous waste disposal practices, and to enhance personal safety. By improperly disposing of biohazardous waste, the university can be liable for costs due to environmental contamination and non- compliance from regulatory agencies. The Biosafety Permit held by the Principal Investigator will dictate which procedure you must follow. If you're unsu re whether to follow the Level 1 or Level 2 procedure, ask your supervisor. LEVEL 1 BIOHAZARDOUS WASTE PROCEDURE 1.Collect Level 1 waste in the c olorless autoclave bags (available at Science Stores). When full, seal the bag loosely with \"hatched\" autoclave tape. 2.Decontaminate the outside of the bag with a suitable disinfectant and affix a label to the bag indicating that it is Level 1 biohazardous waste. 3.Place the bag in your lab's designated bin for hazardous waste pickup. 4.Use the online request system to request pickup: hazmatwaste.its.sfu.ca. Requests may be made for a single pickup or a recurring (weekly) pickup. Hazardous waste c ollection is scheduled at Burnaby campus every Tuesday and Friday between 10:00 am and noon. Surrey campus collection is every Thursday between 10:00 am and noon and Vancouver campus pickups are scheduled as needed. In order to have a timely pickup, ensure that a contact person is available on the requested pickup day and time. LEVEL 2 BIOHAZARDOUS W ASTE PROCEDURE 1.Collect Level 2 waste in the orange autoclave bags (available at Science Stores). The bag must be placed in a labeled bag holder with a biohazard sign. 2.When full, seal the bag loosely with autoclave tape. Tape with the word \"autoclaved\" must be used for all Level 2 waste. 3.Decontaminate the outside of the bag with a suitable disinfectant and take the bag to your lab'sdesignated autoclave room using appropriate secondary containment. 4.All Level 2 biohazardous waste must be autoclaved and then placed in the designated bins in each autoclave room for pickup by the waste disposal company. Follow the department procedure fo r a utoclaving Level 2 biohazardous waste. If you do not know the procedure or have not been trained i n au toclave use, ASK FOR HELP! The following is a list of department contacts for each autoclave: Autoclave Department Contact Local Email more information, please consult the SFU Biosafety Manual or contact EH RS at local 27265 67 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Blood, Body Fluids and Biomedical Waste Blood and body fluids may contain viruses and therefore may be treated as biohazards, depending on the animal from which they originated. For example, clean samples from humans are treated as biohazard level 2 as are many samples from birds. However, fluids from uninfected fish are not treated as biohazards. Protocols for handling and disposal of these potentially infectious samples may be obtained upon consultation with EHS. Specific lab protocols will need to be established to receive the required permits. Biomedical and pathological waste that is generated in Health Services must be treated as biohazardous waste if it is heavily soiled (e.g. bandages or dressings which are dripping blood). This waste must be collected in orange autoclave bags, autoclaved on site (there is an autoclave in Health Services) and stored in a plastic bin for pick-up by the waste disposal company. Anatomical Biohazardous Waste Animal and fish tissues should be placed in heavy (high mil number) plastic bags and stored in a designated tissue freez-er. Staff from the Animal Resource Centre will pick up the packaged tissues directly from the freezer and will arrange for their disposal. Radioactive tissues must be held for decay before disposal. When adequately decayed, the radioactive symbols should be removed. Biohazardous Material Waste Labelling Hazardous waste labels are required for biohazardous waste being collected from SFU laboratories. Individual labels are available from EHS and Science Stores for the following waste streams: Waste type Waste description Label type Level 1 Biohazardous WasteLaboratory solid waste which has come into contact with Risk Group 1 biohazards and is collected in clear autoclave bags. Note: No label is required for Level 2 biohazardous waste that is collected in orange auto - clave bags.Blue-grey , self-adhesive Anatomical Biohazardous WasteAnimal and fish tissues which are collected in black heavy mil bags and can be classified as either level 1 or level 2 biohazardous waste and designated as such on the labelBlue-grey , self-adhesive All waste containers and packages must be properly identified according to the following requirements: 1. A ny non-applicable labels must be removed from waste containers and packages or otherwise defaced. 2. T he label must be completed in ink and clearly legible. 3. C omplete all fields on the label in full (see Figures 1 and 2). 4. A ffix the label securely to the waste container or package. Labels for are self-adhesive.The Biohazardous Waste Stream continued 68 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Sharps and Needles Sharps containers are designed to contain needles, scalpel blades, razor blades, and similar items. All used sharps must be placed in the appropriate sharps container. Sharps contaminated with biohazardous materials (level 1 and 2 should be placed in the red sharps containers. For sharps contaminated with radioisotopes contact the Hot Lab (SBB-B7249). Sharps which are neither biohazardous or radioactive should be placed in the yellow sharps containers.

Local Melanie Gascoine Radiation Safety Technician(Hot Lab - B7249) Binab Karmacharya Waste Stream Mixed Biohazards Biohazardous and Radioactive Waste Do not autoclave radioactive materials. Please consult the Radiation Safety Technician for information on disposal of radioactive materials. Disposing of Radioactive Biohazards Do not autoclave radioactive biohazards. For disposal of radioactive biohazards, please contact the Biosafety Officer and Radiation Safety Technician ; an as-sessment will be made to determine which hazard to deal with first. Biohazardous and Chemically Toxic Waste Toxic and/or volatile chemicals should not be autoclaved (e.g., Ethidium Bromide, bleach). Biohazardous materials that are contaminated with chemicals should be destroyed first by sterilizing with bleach in a fume hood. The inacti-vated biohazardous waste can now be treated as chemical waste.

Gloves, goggles, and face mask for 2 people Disposable shoe covers (booties or large plasticbags + strings). Absorbent paper towels, or other absorbent mate - rial. All-purpose disinfectant, such as bleach. Bucket (can be used to store the spill kit) Tongs and/or forceps for picking up broken glass orcontaminated sharps. Sharps container if you use sharps frequently Sturdy plastic bags (6 mill), autoclave bag. Biohazard spill warning signs, and flagging tape. All non disposable items should be compatible withthe disinfectant to be used or autoclavable. Theitems should also fit in bags for disinfection or inthe autoclave bag. Biohazard Spill Procedure Initial Response 1.If switches are accessible, shut off air conditioningunits and ceiling fans. 2.Evacuate the lab if there is potential for aerosol gen-eration from the spilled material. Spills in biosafetycabinets will likely be contained within the cabinet. 3.Post a \"do not enter\" sign on the door. 4.Secure corridor near lab entrance with \"do notenter\" tape. 5.Assess whether people or clothing require treat -ment for exposure to hazardous organisms. 6.Consult with supervisor. 7.Consult with lab coordinator. 8.Allow 60 minutes for aerosols to settle before initi-ating clean-up. Clean Up 1.Wearing gloves, mark the spill perimeter with agrease pen or masking tape. Remember that someevaporation may have occurred on flat and verticalsurfaces. 2.If spill is in a piece of equipment, unplug it, and posta notice. 3.Set up the disposal bucket with a plastic bag liner. 4.Do not recap or bend needles; using tongs, placethem in a sharps container. 5.Remove broken glass with tongs into an autoclav - able container for autoclaving. 6.If practicable, begin cleaning upper surfaces andvertical surfaces before floors. 7.Soak paper towel in decontaminant such as bleachand lay them over the perimeter of the spill. Con-tinue laying soaked paper towels, moving towardsthe centre of the spill. 8.Place dry paper towels on top to soak up remainingliquid and apply more disinfectant. Keep spill areacovered with decontaminant for 30 minutes. 9.Remove paper towels to lined bucket and wipe upuntil all material is absorbed and the area is dry. 10. Add more bleach to the bucket to ensure organismkill. 11. Place bucket in a fume hood for venting for 24hours and wash hands. 12. After 24 hours, lift out bag and while standing overa sink with running water, poke a hole in the bot - tom of the plastic bag to drain the bleach. 13. Place the drained plastic bag with solids into thewaste basket. 14. Wash hands. Documentation Complete an SFU incident report form, available on the En- vironmental Health and Safety website or Security website. https://www.sfu.ca/srs/contact/report/report- incident.html If an employee visited a physician, or was absent beyond the day of the incident (due to the incident), then the supervisor completes a WorkSafeBC Form 7. 71 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Working in Biosafety Cabinets Before using a BSC If equipped with a UV (purple) light, ensure it is turned off. Decontaminate work surfaces with a suitable disin-fectant. Place all materials needed for a procedure insidethe cabinet before starting. Place supplies, equipment and absorbent towels sothat air intake or exhaust grills are not obstructed. If the cabinet is not turned on, allow the fan tooperate for 15 minutes to reach the proper operat - ing speed and to remove the particle load in thecabinet. Check the magnahelic gauge to knowwhere your cabinet operates at. Place your gloves over the cuff of your lab coat. Using a BSC Movement of arms and materials in and out ofa BSC may disrupt the \"curtain of air\" which maycause exposure of bioaerosols.Vortexes and mixers should be placed toward therear of the cabinet. Work at least 4-6 inches inside the cabinet window.Do not block the front grill. Clean up spills as soon as they occur; remove anddisinfect the grill if contaminated. Minimizing active motions behind you will mini-mize disruption of the air curtain that protects you. Your head should be above the front opening. After using a BSC Leave blower on for at least five minutes to purgethe cabinet. Remove and decontaminate equipment and materi - als, and disinfect cabinet surfaces. Turn off the fan and fluorescent lamp, and turn onthe UV light to help decontaminate surfaces.

The four main locations are B8213 (Biology), SSB 6113 (MBB), K9605 (Kinesiology) and BH 9805 (Health Sciences). There are several others that belong to specific research or teaching labs. You need permission of the operators to use these. How they Work Autocla ves are devices which use moist heat (steam) under pressure to destroy microorganisms by denatur - ing proteins and nucleic acids. This is the fastest and one of the most effective means of sterilization available, although it is not suitable for all materials. Organisms are killed in an exponential fashion, and so the exposure time required depends on the rapidity with which the steam is able to penetrate and heat the material, as well as the overall microbial load. General Operation There are two t ypes of cycles, liquid and dry (labeled \"wrapped\" on the autoclave). It is important to choose the cycle wisely. Autoclave tape which develops words or stripes is used as a communication tool to be certain which items have been through the procedure. Dry cycles The temperature and pressure mount rapidly to 121\u00b0C/15 psi and hold for the desired time. At the end of this \"expo - sure\" time the pressure drops rapidly until the autoclave is in a state of vacuum. It remains in a vacuum during the drying stage of the cycle. This can damage fragile contain-ers, cause liquids to boil over or loose particles to be drawn into the plumbing. Therefore it should only be used for sturdy materials that have no loose or liquid components, such as empty glass, polypropylene and metal. Liquid Cycles The temperature and pressure rise slowly to 121\u00b0C/15 psi and are held for the exposure period. The autoclave returns slowly to ambient pressure and unlocks at ap - proximately 100\u00b0C. This cycle is the safest for all materials, but particularly liquids, garbage (especially agar which be - comes liquid with heating or plastics which melt) and soils. The average cycle with an exposure time of 20 minutes, will take an hour to complete. Load preparation 1.Solutions: there are two main cautions here: Don'toverfill the containers, or they will boil over (2/3 fullis the maximum; if there is a stir bar in it, only halffull). Don't forget to loosen the lids or the bottleswill explode. 2.Use foil over opening of graduated cylinders, flasksetc.3.Plastic containers with lids may melt/deform andform a vacuum inside if the lids are too tight; thesecontainers should just have the lids taped on andfoil placed over that. They may survive a liquid cyclebetter than dry. 4.Put autoclave tape on each item; this will indicatewhether your load has been sterilized. Label theitems with your name or room number. 5.Never leave materials in the autoclave overnight -they stay hot and many loads are ruined this way. Wastes This applies to level 2 wastes at this time. Disposable plastic ware is collected into autoclave bags for sterilization before disposal. Do not tape them tightly shut - steam must be able to enter/escape. Do not overfill large bags - they will not fit into the auto - clave, and the weight can be difficult for smaller research- ers to lift. Sterilized level two wastes are collected into the desig- nated bins for pickup. Operator Safety - Burn Prevention 1.Stand to the side when opening the door - steamescapes at face level. 2.Use heavy heat-proof gloves to remove items. 3.Occasionally liquids are super heated and may boilover explosively especially if a stir bar is autoclavedin the liquid. Stir bars can be autoclaved in screwcap tubes. 4.All items should be loosely capped - the pressure may cause tightly capped bottles to explode. Equipment Protection Materials which spill into the autoclave and are pulled through the drain can block the plumbing. The chief culprit is agar, which solidifies as it cools in the drains, and the greatest damage is caused by liquefied plastics. Soil or sand in the plumbing is also hard to clear. For this reason, as well as for convenience, metal bins are provided to contain all the items to be sterilized. Boil overs occur even without operator errors, so it is important to keep the bins clean so the media from lab A is not transferred to the pipettor tips of lab B. Testing Every week ampules containing endospores of a difficult to kill organism, (Bacillus stearothermophilus) are auto - claved and cultured. The results are recorded, and are available to inspection agencies such as Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.73 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Required Orientation Anyone intending to use the autoclaves must be trained. Molecular Biology and Biochemistry (MBB) and Biology offer group training every semester. Kinesiology offers training by appointment. These are given at the beginning of each semester and you will be notified about them via email. Contacts Where Who Room Local Email MBB Deidre de Jong- WongSSB Training You must be trained before using a high speed centrifuge. Find the person in charge of the centrifuge you wish to use and arrange for them to show you the protocols and prop - er use of the machine. This applies to everyone regardless of whether you have used a centrifuge elsewhere. Rotor cleaning Always rinse with distilled water and turn upside down to dry. If a spill containing a microorganism or biohazard occurs, use ethanol to rinse the rotor and wipe the inside of the machine. For radioisotope spills, contact the person in charge of that machine to help you clean it up. Never use Decon for radioactive materials as it damages the rotor surface. Tube removal If a tube is stuck DO NOT pry it out with a metal imple - ment. Try using a hemostat or contact the person in charge of the machine to help you. Metal fatigue Weak rotors can split. If you notice pitting, deep scratches, or cracks on the rotor DO NOT use it! Contact the person in charge of the machine if you are uncertain or have ques - tions. Rotor documentation and retirement Damaged and old rotors must be retired and are very ex - pensive to replace. Help prolong their lives and document use so we can ensure we have no major accidents.Locations Do not use microwaves in common eating areas to heat your solution and vice versa, never heat your lunch in the microwave in your lab. You do not want EtBr in your lunch. Loose lid s Always loosen lids on containers and bottles before heat - ing th em up. Expanding liquid and air can create a build- up of pressure and possibly cause an explosion. Metal compon ents Do not place metals or i tems containing inner metal com - ponents into a microwave. Superheati ng liquids All liquids can superh eat (reach temperatures above the boiling point withou t boiling). A bump can cause it to sud - denly boil, spill over, and cause severe burns. Always wear insulating gloves when handli ng the container. Ultraviolet light (UV) is extremely hazardous. The shorter the wavelength, the greater the damage that is done and in a much shorter time. For example, at a couple inches from the transilluminator of a 300 nm light source, Work - SafeBC suggests you have about 1 second of exposure in an 8 hour day before your skin or eyes begin getting dam - aged. With a 360 nm transilluminator the time increases to about 5 minutes. Always take protective measures to ensure your eyes and skin do not get burned. Use UV opaque eyewear or a shield when taking a picture. If you are working on the transilluminator, you will also need to wear gloves and long sleeves to protect your hands and arms. Exposure to UV light can cause short term blindness, detached lenses, cataracts, and other eye problems. Since it can burn skin, it can also generate skin cancer; so protect yourself. A face-shield can be tested for UV blockage. If a certain gel is placed on the inside of the shield, then exposed to UV light, it will glow if UV rays penetrate the shield.Autoclaves continued Centrifuges Microwave Ovens Ultra Violet (UV) Light 74 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Phenol is used extensively at low concentrations in some medications such as Chloroseptic and Blistix lip balm. It is also used in common cleaning reagents such as Lysol. At the low concentration found in these products, phenol is beneficial and basically harmless. At the concentrations used in laboratories, phenol can be very hazardous and care must be taken when using it. Precautions Wear shoes, not sandals. Wear a lab coat. Wear good gloves (no holes). Wear protective eyewear. NOTE: all organic solventswill dissolve soft contact lenses. If you get thesechemicals in your eye, the lens will melt onto youreyeballs ! Use a workspace with plenty of room to move andwork without knocking anything over. Be prepared in case a spill or splash occurs. Havepaper towels, ETOH, water, and hand soap available. Spill Clean Up Phenol has anesthetic properties so you may not realize you've spilled some on yourself or may think it isn't as bad as you have been lead to believe. So be aware of what you are doing and don't be fooled, it will start burning in about 30 seconds. Don't panic. Dab up the spill and rinse well with water, thenethanol. Everything can go in the trash or down thedrain. If you have cleaned the spill area well, you won't beable to smell any phenol. Phenol on you Don't panic. If you spill it on your clothing, immediately removethe clothing. Wash skin gently but well with soap and water.Soap changes the properties of phenol so it is nolonger able to permeate your skin. Use hand soapnot dish soap we have for lab glassware which is tooharsh and can worsen the problem. Smell the contaminated area, there should be nophenol scent. If you can still smell it continue towash to remove the phenol from your skin. If you have a large spill on yourself, use the labshower or eyewash to quickly remove the phenol,and shout for help. Don't be shy! Accidents hap - pen, don't make it worse by not taking care of theproblem properly.Phenols is not regulated as a hazardous waste, its mutagenic properties may present a human health hazard if it is placed in the trash or poured down the sanitary sewer system. The following procedures should be followed when disposing of EtBr solutions, gels and EtBr contaminated materials. EtBr Solutions Do not discard EtBr gels or EtBr solutions containing organic solvents or alcohol down the sewer. Aqueous solu-tions containing < 10 g/ml (10 ppm) may be released to the sanitary sewer. Aqueous solutions containing > 10g/ml EtBr and EtBr solutions that contain organic solvents or alcohol must be collected in a properly labeled container and may be disposed of via the University's Chemical Waste Program. Gels Containing EtBr Place gels in sturdy plastic bag or container. Use a Chemi-cal Waste label, identify as \"Ethidium Bromide gel\" , and fill out a eReq through Science Stores for waste pickup. http://www.sfu.ca/science-stores/disposal.htm Gloves and Contaminated Debris Gloves and paper towels that are visibly contaminated with EtBr should be placed in a bag or container. Label the container to identify the material and and fill out a eReq through Science Stores for waste pickup. http://www.sfu.ca/science-stores/disposal.htm Spills Spills of dilute EtBr liquid (about 0.5 ug/ml) can be wiped up with paper towels, and then cleaned with ethanol. Everything can be thrown into the regular trash. Spills of higher concentration liquids can be cleaned the same way as the dilute solutions but the cleaning materials must be be disposed of via the University's Chemical Waste Program. After wiping up all the liquid, sprinkle activated charcoal onto the area and let it sit overnight to absorb any remaining EtBr from the surface. Other dyes When disposing of dyes such as SybrGreen and Gel Red, please use the proper handling and disposal procedures. If you have any questions or are unsure of the procedure please ask your supervisor or contact the EHS department.82 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Controlled Activities In Canada, any controlled activity that involves human and animal pathogens and toxins is regulated by two federal agencies: 1) the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and 2) the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The regulations defined by these agencies fall under the authority of: the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act (HPTA, 2009); the Human Pathogens and Toxins Regulations(HPTR); the Health of Animals Act (HAA) and the Health of Animals Regulations (HAR). Controlled activities include possessing, handling, using, producing, storing, transferring or importing a pathogen as defined by PHAC and/or CFIA. SFU has a licence from PHAC to permit SFU personnel to conduct these controlled activities with regulated bio - hazardous materials, provided they have an SFU-issued Biosafety Permit. PHAC and CFIA regulate the importation and transfer of human and animal pathogens into Canada. Depending on the nature of material to be imported or transferred, different regulations may apply. As a condition of SFU's licence to conduct controlled activities with regulated biohazardous materials, the BSO must be notified before arrangements are made to do the following: import a human pathogen or toxin; receive a human pathogen or toxin from anotherfacility; transfer a human pathogen or toxin from anotherfacility. Please contact the BSO (http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs/research-safety/biosafety.html) if you plan on importing or transferring regulated materials.Transfer of Regulated Biohazardous Material Imports SFU users must have a copy of the current SFU license in order to import regulated human pathogens and toxins, and terrestrial animal pathogens from another country, or order them from some domestic suppliers. If a pathogen affects terrestrial animals, a CFIA-issued Compliance Letter may be required. Contact the SFU BSO for assistance. Please be aware that a separate importation permit from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is required for the following pathogens (these are not regulated by PHAC): pathogens that cause a foreign animal disease, an emerging animal disease, or any terrestrial animal pathogen when imported in alive animal, animal product, or by-product (e.g., blood,serum, tissue, cell line). Domestic Transfers SFU users must have an SFU-issued Biosafety Permit in order to transfer (receive or supply) regulated human pathogens and toxins, and terrestrial animal pathogens. To transfer human/animal pathogens either from SFU to another Canadian facility/institution, or from another Ca-nadian facility/institution to SFU, the PI must complete the Biohazardous Agent Transfer Notification Form. This form must be signed by the SFU PI, the SFU BSO, the recipient institution PI and the recipient institution's BSO. A copy of completed forms must be forwarded to SFU's BSO. 83 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Monthly Inspections In accordance with the Canadian Biosafety Stan- dards and Guidelines, please ensure you complete this self-check in your laboratory monthly: All lab members have received all appropriate train-ing. All lab members are knowledgeable of emergencyprocedures. All doors to the containment zone are kept closed. Street clothing is kept separate from laboratory coats. Paperwork is kept separate from biohazard workareas. PPE is worn when required in the lab, but is not wornin the hallways or common areas. Guidelines for handling biohazards safely are em-ployed. Hazardous materials are labelled, stored and dis-posed of as per SFU protocols. Hazardous materials are stored & transferred inleak-proof, impact resistant containers & secondarycontainment is used. Effective disinfectants are available and used prop - erly. Equipment (i.e. BSC and centrifuge/rotors) is inspect - ed before use and disinfected after use. Gas cylinders stored upright and secured from tip - ping. Electrical hazards are minimized. All incidents are reported to the supervisor and EHS. Annual Inspections CL1 Laboratories at SFU Departments will inspect level one biohazard labs on an annual basis. Principal Investigators are expected to self-inspect on an annual basis as part of their annual biosafety permit review CL2 Laboratories at SFU The Environmental Health and Safety Department con- ducts inspections of all level 2 biohazard labs on campus on an annual basis.

(2015). Page 8 of 897 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual What is an MTA? Material Transfer Agreements (MTA's) are legal documents (or agreements) used for SFU to assume responsibility for the use of material that is transferred to the campus from another research institution or supply house. When do I need one? An MTA is required when another institution requests it prior to sending material to SFU, or when a research material is being sent from SFU. Who signs them? These legal documents can only be signed by the Director of Research Services on behalf of the University. Do not sign them yourself. Research Services can also provide you with material transfer agreement templates and can review agree - ments sent to you from a colleague elsewhere. A copy of the signed agreement will be sent to you for your records. What do I need to do? SFU faculty should ensure they have completed the MTA Application available from Research Services which is available on their website. Material Transfer Agreements Biohazard Transport Transport Between Labs This includes any transport on campus in corridors, stairways, and elevators. Primary container : The primary container must be sealed, leak-proof, and puncture resistant. Secondary container (see picture below): The secondary container must contain enough absorbent material to com - pletely retain all of the contents of the primary container(s). It must be leak proof, puncture resistant, and capable of being securely closed. Please label this container with a biohazard symbol when in use. Transport to/from SFU Transportation of Dangerous Goods regulations likely apply. Please contact EHS or your department's TDG representa - tive. This may include transport by road, ferry, or aircraft and may include field samples or the transfer of material from other institutions. See the EHS website for more information on TDG Training http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs/research-safety/hazardous-material-management/transportation-dangerous- goods.html 98 http://www.sfu.ca/srs/ehs.htm l Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Overview and context of the ARC (Animal Resource Centre) Some research conducted at SFU involves animals. These studies can be observational (e.g. diversity of birds in different types of forests, feeding behaviour of snow geese) or invasive where blood samples may be extracted from an animal through a catheter (permanent tube) implanted in an animal. Most of this research is conducted in our centralized Ani - mal Resource Centre. Species used in research include rats and mice, rabbits, hamsters, fish and also wild species of birds and mammals. These animals are managed under strict standards that ensure their health and humane treatment. These standards are speci - fied by a federal agency, Canadian Council of Animal Care, as well as, the university's own policies that are administered by the Director of Animal Care and the University Animal Care Committee (UACC). Standards of animal care are strictly enforced and adherence to standards is monitored. If your project uses animals (essentially vertebrates) then your faculty supervisor must apply to use animals for the proj - ect. The application form and instructions are available on the web. The form is completed and signed by the faculty member (Principle Investigator) and sent to the Director of the ARC. Then you wait until the form is processed by the Director and the University Animal Care Committee. Depending on the nature of your project and the level of invasiveness (category A-E), the application is assessed by the Director and Chair of the UACC or by the Director and whole UACC. This process takes time; the UACC generally meets monthly. After a project has been approved the ordering of animals can occur. This has to be done through the Animal Resource Centre. Project monitoring: approval is given for 1 year and then you need annual renewals for 3 more years. Amendments have to be approved (by written form) for changes in protocol (procedures), change in personnel, ad - ditional animals required, additional species, or strains of a species. Please contact us if you have any questions about changes in protocol and the amendment procedure.ARC Policies & Procedures 99 Environmental Health & Safety Lab Safety Training Manual Working with Animals Safety while working with animals Handling live animals During routine studies you will likely have to : - T ransfer animals - C onduct procedures - Take blood samples - P erform euthanasia Rats and mice are lifted by the base of the tail. Rabbits are held by the scruff of the neck and supported underneath. Let their head tuck in under your arm - this keeps them calm while moving them. To reduce the likelihood of being bitten or scratched, the following precautions are recommended: 1. Frequent handling to condition the animal; 2. Handle the animals properly; 3. Ensure your finger is not available;4. Offer something other than your finger. We try to maintain socialization of animals by keeping them together. We provide environmental enrichment so that the animal is more relaxed and less likely to bite. Talk in a soft voice, when approaching the cage and han- dling animals. This alerts the animal that you are present and tends to calm them. When you first begin working with your animals you will be shown how to handle them. Please do not be afraid to ask for help or repeated demonstration of handling procedures. We want to ensure that all animals are handled correctly at all times for their well-being and yours. Blood sampling and other procedures are often performed by our certified technicians. This will vary slightly from project to project. Approved surgery procedures are only performed by trained individuals. If you are going to be learning how to do surgery then someone trained in the procedure must be present at all times. Initially, such training sessions will be supervised and it will be decided whether an individual possesses the necessary skills to be learning the procedures in question. In order to remain compliant with CCAC there must be minimal stress and discomfort to all animals at all times. This policy is strictly adhered to with no exceptions. Training An online training module is available for students, staff and faculty who will be participating in animal based research. Please contact Nicole Belanger in Animal Care Services if you believe you require this training.Instruments and equipment Working with fish requires attention to hazards associated with operating electrical equipment in close proximity to tanks. Please ensure that the area around your tank is free of such hazards. In some instances appropriate protective clothing may be required. Bites and scratches If you are bitten or badly scratched, you should report the incident to your supervisor. If this occurs at the ARC, you will be asked to log the incident in our logbook and will have to fill out an accident report form. If the injury is serious, you should seek medical attention from Health Services or your family physician. They may suggest a tetanus vaccination. Diseases and Zoonosis Diseases can be spread in many ways including the fol- lowing: through open skin wounds, inhalation of aero - solized spores, bacteria, viruses, ingestion due to poor hygiene practices, and by contact with urine or saliva (bite wounds). Remember to always wash your hands after working with animals, avoid contact with feces and urine where possible, and cover open wounds. A zoonotic disease is one that is transmitted from human to animal and vice versa. The animals we work with these days are very \"clean\" with rare occurrences of disease being trans-mitted to us. Of more concern is the potential for a human to transmit disease to the \"clean\" animals or to be a carrier between the research animals and their own pets. If you are working with a species that is the same as or similar to your own animals you should ask about measures you can take to decrease the risk of transmitting disease between the two. Allergies When working around animals there is always the poten- tial to develop allergies. For those with existing allergies you should take precautions to limit your exposure to animals you know you are allergic to and consider taking the necessary medications before contacting the animals if your work requires you to be in contact with them. Final comment The safe approach is to always ask when you don't know. Safer for you, kinder to the animal.Laboratory Waste Handling Guide Biohazardous WasteNon- Hazardous Waste Paper & Cardboard*Non-contaminated* Glass (broken/ unbroken) Paper recycling bin BatteriesHazardous Chemical Waste Liquids Sharps SolidsWaste Container Disposal*Non-contaminated* Solid waste Regular garbage cans Regular pick up by JanitorsSubmit Facilities Service Request for pick up by janitors http://fmrequests .sfu.ca * Hazardous waste labels are available at Science Stores and through EHS , email cpeltier @sfu.ca Hazardous waste collection : BBY every Tuesday and Friday | SRY every 2nd Thursday | VAN as needed Request single or recurring (weekly ) pickup http://hazmatwaste .its.sfu.caOrange Autoclave bags Decon with appropriate disinfectant (e.g., 10% bleach for 30 min) or autoclave Dispose down drainRed Sharps containerMax 10 kg in black 2 - 4 mil plastic bags + placed in containers in dept . carcass freezer Animal Care (AC) arranges pickup for BISC and AC . tel. 2-5905 or email acf @sfu. for assistance solve ntsNonhalogenated solve ntsOther , Aque ous Level 1Appropriate container (bag, bottle , vial or original packaging ) Animal Care + BiologyAppropriate containerCylinders Re- fillable Return to vendorRadiological Waste Low level solids Only for materials that can be detected with Geiger counter and are less than twice background Return to Hot Lab SSC -B7249 , tel. 2-3506Glass waste boxes SFU solvent waste container Lecture size Yellow Sharps containerColourless Autoclave bags Empty vialAnimal & fish carcasses , beddingLiquids Sharps Sharps Organic Aqueous Sharps Container + ID tag SFU solvent waste container + ID tag Appropriate container in clear plastic bag + ID tagClear , colourless , 2 mil plastic bag (max 10 kg) + ID tag Pig + vial Clear plastic bag + ID tag + Low leve l waste can Level 2 Liquids Animal & fish carcasses *non-radioactive * Yellow pail at Science Stores Regular pick up by Facilities staff Waste Container Disinfection / Labelling *DisposalSolids Level 2 Level 1 Level 1 Level 2 Level 1 label *Chemical waste label *Chemical waste label *Chemical waste label * Non halogenated solvent waste label *Chemical waste label *Level 1 label * Waste Handling Guide v .2 October 2018For mo re information , contact EHS at ehrs_sfu@sfu.caHalogenated solvent waste label * For waste that fits in more than one category (e.g., radioactive & biohazardous ), contact EHS for guidance ehrs_sfu@sfu.ca.
