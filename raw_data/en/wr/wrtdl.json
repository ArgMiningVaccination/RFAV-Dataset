The Wrights' venture was also an attempt to end the internecine warfare in the world of autism - where some are convinced the disorder is genetic and best treated with intensive therapy, and others blame preservatives in vaccinations and swear by supplements and diet to cleanse the body of heavy metals. With its high-powered board, world-class scientific advisers and celebrity fundraisers like Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Simon, the charity was a powerful voice, especially in Washington. It also made strides toward its goal of unity by merging with three existing autism organizations and raising millions of dollars for research into all potential causes and treatments. The Wrights call it the \"big tent\" approach. But now the fissures in the autism community have made their way into the Wright family, where father and daughter are not speaking after a public battle with themes familiar to thousands of families with autistic children. The Wrights' daughter, Katie, the mother of Christian, says her parents have not given enough support to the people who believe, as she does, that the environment - specifically a synthetic mercury preservative in vaccines - is to blame. No major scientific studies have linked pediatric vaccines and autism, but many parents and their advocates persist and a federal \"vaccine court\" is now reviewing nearly 4,000 such claims. The Wright feud has played out in cyberspace and spilled into Autism Speaks, where those who disagree with Katie Wright's views worry that she is setting its agenda. And the family intent on healing a fractured community has instead opened its old wounds and is, itself, riven. The rift began in April when Katie Wright put herself squarely on the side of \"The Mercurys,\" as that faction is known, on Oprah Winfrey, where she described how her talkative toddler turned unresponsive and out-of-control after his vaccines and only improved with unconventional, and untested, remedies. In a Web interview with David Kirby, author of a controversial book, Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic, Katie Wright lashed out at the \"old guard\" scientists and pioneering autism families. If the old-timers are unable to let go of \"failed strategies,\" she said, they should \"step aside\" and let a new generation \"have a chance to do something different with this money\" that her parents' charity was dispensing. A cold response Complaints poured in from those who said Katie Wright's remarks were denigrating. So, in early June, Bob and Suzanne Wright repudiated their daughter on the charity's Web site. \"Katie Wright is not a spokesperson\" for the organization, the Wrights said in a statement. Her \"personal views differ from ours.\" The Wrights also apologized to \"valued volunteers\" who had been disparaged. Told by friends how cold the rebuke sounded, Suzanne Wright added a line saying, \"Katie is our daughter, and we love her very much.\" Katie Wright called the statement a \"character assassination.\" She said she has not spoken to her father since. She continues to spend time with her mother, but said they have not discussed the situation. Now other autism families who hoped to put their differences aside are shouting at each other in cyberspace. \"Our struggle is not and should not be against each other,\" said Ilene Lainer, the mother of an autistic child and the executive director of the New York Center for Autism. The \"big tent\" approach of Autism Speaks appealed to Mel Karmazin, chief executive of Sirius Radio and an early board member and contributor. \"If you look at what projects Autism Speaks has funded, we are agnostic.\" Karmazin, who also has an autistic grandson, added, \"I never wanted to look my grandson in the eye and tell him I'm taking just one viewpoint or that I think it had to be genetic.\" Bob and Suzanne Wright are sympathetic to Katie's plight, having witnessed Christian's sudden regression and his many physical ailments, mostly gastrointestinal, which afflict many autistic children. The boy did not respond to behavioral therapies, the Wrights said, leading to their daughter's desperate search for anything that might help. The Wrights agreed to disagree with most of Katie Wright's views. But her public attack on other parents crossed a line, Bob and Suzanne Wright said in separate telephone interviews. \"I know my daughter feels deeply that not enough is being done,\" Bob Wright said. \"The larger issue is we want to be helpful to everyone, and to do that we need information, data, facts.\" Where the money goes Some in the traditional scientific community worry that Autism Speaks has let Katie Wright's experience shape its agenda. But a list of current research grants on the Autism Speaks Web site suggests that the Wrights, while walking a fine line, are leaning toward genetic theories. Between 2005 and 2007, the charity sponsored $11.5-million in grants for genetic research (compared with $5.9-million by all its partners between 1997 and 2004). It sponsored $4.4-million in environmental research (down from $6-million granted by the partners in the previous seven years). And many of the environmental studies explore what is known as the double-hit hypothesis: That the genes for autism may be activated in some children by exposure to mercury or other neurotoxins. Bob and Suzanne Wright say their two-year immersion into the world of autism has been an eye-opener, especially the heated arguments. Yet Suzanne Wright is confident that \"we'll work our way through this.\" Autism, she said \"has done enough damage to my family. I'm not letting it do "}
