I was too caught up in the momentum of my initial chemo and treatment to consider anything outside that but in the recovery period after my stem cell transplant I was desperately depleted and beset by woes similar to chemo side effects. A close friend suggested a traditional chinese medicine practitioner that specialises in cancer patients. I kept on with the western medicine of course, and have taken care that the trad chinese (TCM) herbs did not interfere with my western drugs, but I have to say that the TCM treatment which has included herbs and acupuncture has been very helpful and supportive to me in managing my symptoms and more importantly, my energy levels and stamina. I am the kind of person that asks a lot of questions of my practitioners, and I've really found that the TCM interpretations on how the body works have helped me a lot. They are definitely complementary to my western treatment and I would encourage anyone dealing with cancer to try it for themselves. I am based in Melbourne Di, so I don't know of anyone in Sydney but I do think it's worth finding out if there is anyone that has experience with cancer patients because you can then benefit from their understanding of our specific needs. I guess it's also worth being cautious of unscrupulous or fraudulent people with wild claims about wonder cures etc. Proper accredited TCM practitioners are the way to go in my opinion. Oh - I mustn't forget to mention my secret weapon - meditation. I meditate at least once a day, and have found that to be the single most helpful and supportive complementary practice that I do. I use a mix of mantra and breathing based meditation, but guided meditations are just as beneficial I think. If you are wanting to start out with meditation, you may find that it's difficult to find a peaceful place, your mind busy with thoughts, and feel like \"it isn't working\". I would encourage you to persist - even with the thoughts, it does work and as your mind and body get used to meditating, the peaceful places you will find can be quite exquisite. - cheers - "}
