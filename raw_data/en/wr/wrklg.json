The answer, according to study after the study, is an emphatic yes. The latest scientific paper to explore the question of vaccine safety is [a review published in Pediatrics](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/2/325), a leading journal. Researchers looked at dozens of quality research papers on the [safety of the vaccines](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/2/325) recommended for children in the US (most of which are similar to those [recommenced for children in Europe](http://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Pages/Scheduler.aspx)). It found that serious problems following vaccination were 'extremely rare' and usually resolved quickly, adding that this very small risk is heavily outweighed by the 'protective benefits that vaccines provide'.
