On Tuesday, Baba Ramdev launched his own Corona kit saying that it will help in the treatment of coronavirus. In fact, he claimed that these medicines have 100% recovery rate within 3-7 days. But the Government of India's AYUSH ministry promptly shut him down asking for proof of authenticity. And now in a new turn of events, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is saying that people might have to wait for the vaccine a little longer as it might take another year to develop a foolproof remedy for [covid-19](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/steroid-drug-dexamethasone-shows-a-new-ray-of-hope-in-treating-covid-19/). On 4th March 2020, WHO spokesperson, Tarik Jasarevic had said that, \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the [WHO](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/covid-19-wonder-drug-hydroxychloroquine-can-impact-the-heart-study/) recommends enrolment into a randomised controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.\" More than 100 candidates are working on this vaccine Speaking by video-conference to deputies from the European Parliament's health committee, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that if such a vaccine became a reality, it should become a public good available to all. \"It would be very difficult to say for sure that we will have a vaccine,\" Tedros said. \"We never had a vaccine for a coronavirus.

He said the WHO had already more than 100 candidates for a [vaccine](https://www.healthshots.com/health-news/drug-for-novel-coronavirus/) of which one was at an advanced stage of development. \"Hoping that there will be a vaccine, the estimate is we may have a vaccine within one year. If accelerated, it could be even less than that, but by a couple of months. That's what scientists are saying,\" he concluded. (With inputs from Reuters) "}
