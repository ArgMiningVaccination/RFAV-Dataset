You might have felt sad or anxious, plagued with nightmares, or just seemed to experience a severe streak of bad luck. It might have left you at the end of your rope, willing to do almost anything to break the spell and lift the jinx placed on you. Fortunately, breaking a curse is fairly simple -- all you need are the right tools and knowledge. These herbs are powerful hex-breakers that can help cleanse negative energy from you and get things back to normal. Angelica Root Angelica archangelica, or simply [angelica](https://www.originalbotanica.com/angelica-root/), also known as Holy Ghost Root or Archangel Root, is known for its white flowers and fragrant roots. The whole roots are wonderful protective charms, but pieces are also useful for adding to baths, protective charm bags, or using in washes. To remove a curse from your home, brew the angelica in some hot water. Strain out the root, and add half of the liquid to a bucket of wash water. Thoroughly mop your home from the back to the front, and dispose of the dirty water over your shoulder, toward the rising sun. When your floor has dried, sprinkle the rest of the angelica tea in the corners of each room. You can also follow the instructions above, then add the liquid to a cleansing bath. Angelica is a very powerful purifier and remover of hexes and curses. Five Finger Grass [Five finger grass](https://www.originalbotanica.com/five-finger-grass-herb/), or Potentilla species, is sometimes known as cinquefoil. The leaves have five \"fingers\" each, and each one is said to represent health, wealth, love, wisdom, and power. It is often used as an herb for luck in money or love matters, as well as a protective talisman. Drain an egg from its shell, then fill the shell with dried five finger grass and seal it with wax. Any home that has this egg charm will be free of evil. You can also use this herb to get rid of curses that seem to stick around. To do this, brew the herb into a tea and strain out the leaves. Add this to a cleansing bath, and fully immerse yourself. Repeat this for nine consecutive days. For best results, start when the moon is waning -- according to lunar magic, the power of the curse will decrease as the moon does. Nettle There are many species of [nettles](https://www.originalbotanica.com/nettle-leaves/), but some of the best-known are of the Urtica genus. This includes Urtica dioica, the stinging nettle. It is called this because the plants are covered in fine, prickling hairs that are hollow, like needles, and inject small amounts of irritants into the skin when touched. Other nettles, like the bull nettle, are similar. When you look at it this way, it makes sense to use this prickly plant to drive out negative energy and break curses! To remove a malicious spell that has been placed on you, mix dried nettle leaves with [Jinx Removing powder](https://www.originalbotanica.com/jinx-removing-sachet-powder/). (You can also dust yourself with plain powder for protection from hexes.) Take this mixture, and use it to draw an unbroken line across your doorway to keep hexes and curses away from you. Nettle is also used as an ingredient in purifying baths. Use it alone, or mix it with other cleansing herbs (like [rue](https://www.originalbotanica.com/rue-herb/) or [rosemary](https://www.originalbotanica.com/rosemary-leaves/)). Brew it into a tea, strain out the leaves, and add the liquid to a tub of clean, warm water. Soak your entire body to purify your energy and take off curses. Wormwood [Wormwood](https://www.originalbotanica.com/wormwood-herb/) is a name for several plants in the genus Artemisia, especially Artemisia absinthum. It is called \"wormwood\" in part because it was used as a dewormer before safer medications were developed -- the intensely bitter herb would help drive parasites from the body. Just like stinging nettle, it makes sense to use wormwood to get rid of curses. It can drive them out of your life just like it drives out worms. To use wormwood to break a hex, burn it over [charcoal](https://www.originalbotanica.com/swift-lite-charcoal-incense/) in a [fireproof bowl](https://www.originalbotanica.com/smudge-pot-charcoal-burner/). Fan the smoke over yourself and all of the corners of your home (make sure it is well-ventilated since it will produce a lot of smoke). Curses are messy to live with, but they do not have to be messy to get rid of. With spiritual baths, smoke cleansing, floor washes, and herbal charms, you can remove any malevolent spell anyone tries to place on you. Bloodroot [Bloodroot](https://www.originalbotanica.com/bloodroot-herb/) is excellent at turning evil magic away from you. Place a few pieces in a [red flannel bag](https://www.originalbotanica.com/mojo-bags/), and carry it with you for protection against hexes. To clear negative energy from a space, burn bloodroot and fume the area with its smoke. It is also a good idea to place sachets or jars containing bloodroot around your home, for protection against evil. Be sure to keep these up high, well out of reach of any pets or children, since the sap of the plant is toxic. If you know who has cursed you and where they live, wait until midnight during a waning moon. Take a whole bloodroot, and throw it onto their doorstep. This will return the hex to the sender. Agrimony Herb [Agrimony](https://www.originalbotanica.com/agrimony-herb/) is a favorite for un-hexing baths. Add some to a cup of boiling water, allow it to steep, strain out the herbs, and add the liquid to bathwater before stepping in. Allow yourself to soak thoroughly, covering every inch of your skin with the agrimony-infused water. Step out of the bath, let yourself air-dry, and discard the bathwater by throwing it over your left shoulder toward the sunrise. You can make a curse-breaking candle by rubbing fresh or dry Agrimony herbs on a [white candle](https://www.originalbotanica.com/7-day-pullout-candle-white/). Burn one inch each day for a week, preferably [during a waning moon](https://originalbotanica.com/blog/candle-burning-days-lunar-cycle-moon-phases). By the end of seven days, the hex will be removed. Agrimony is also a useful addition to hex-breaking bath bombs. You need: - 1 cup baking soda - 1/2 cup citric acid (vitamin C) powder - 1/2 cup Epsom salt or [sea salt](https://www.originalbotanica.com/sea-bath-salt/) - A few tablespoons of agrimony Combine the dry ingredients. Add two teaspoons of moisturizing oil (jojoba, grapeseed, or olive), any essential oils you like for fragrance, and enough water to help everything hold together. Be careful not to add too much water -- too much, and the ingredients will begin to foam. Form the ingredients into balls, or press them into a muffin tin and allow them to dry completely. When you are ready for a hex-breaking spiritual bath, add one bath bomb to clean bathwater before stepping in. Galangal Root (Chewing John) [Galangal](https://www.originalbotanica.com/galangal-chewing-john/) root, also known as Alpinia Galanga and Chewing John, is very helpful as a protective herb. When worn, it helps keep evil at bay. To break a hex, powder the herb and burn it on charcoal. To reverse a curse and send it back where it came from, chew on a piece while picturing the curse returning to the sender. Then, spit it out. You can create a powder to help confuse anyone trying to do you harm through magical means. Grind together dried galangal, vetiver, fennel, and the ashes from a burnt, knotted black string. Galangal breaks hexes, vetiver breaks hexes and lends extra power, fennel is an unpredictable herb that breaks hexes by twisting the situation around, and the string helps the hexer get \"tangled up\" in their own wrongdoing. Burn this powder as incense, sprinkle it around your property, or use it to dress candles. Being the target of a hex can be scary, but it does not mean you are powerless. You have the ability to protect yourself and your home, break the curse and send it back to the person who put it on you. Working with these three herbs can help you unlock their hidden talents and awaken their full potential as magical ingredients. "}
