Those who practice it use tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals. They believe these stimulate the healing process. It was developed in the late 1700s in Germany. It's common in many European countries, but it's not quite as popular in the United States. Dr. Ormston was awarded the Degree of Doctor of Veterinary Homeopath from the British Institute of Homeopathy. A basic belief behind homeopathy is \"like cures like.\" In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person can -- in a very small dose -- treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger the body's natural defenses. For example, red onion makes your eyes water. That's why it's used in homeopathic remedies for allergies. Treatments for other ailments are made from poison ivy, white arsenic, crushed whole bees, and an herb called arnica. The same remedy does not affect every animal the same way. Remedies come in a variety of forms, like sugar pellets, liquid drops, creams, gels, and tablets. We usually recommend a liquid in alcohol. The reason for the alcohol is for local vasodilation that allows for absorption of the remedy into the blood. There are single remedies and combination remedies. There are 38 different headache remedies for people. Choosing the correct one requires the collection of minute details as to when the headache is better or worse. Often, we find that combination remedies work better in animals as this information may be difficult to gather. Equine Botanicals has a combination line of Flower Essences that work well to help with mental issues facing some of out canine and equine friends. "}
