Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other coverage determinations.

Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 General Background Skin Substitutes Biologic skin substitutes can refer to skin that is harvested from a donor site and transplanted into the recipient site. Also called biological tissue, these skin substitutes can be an autograft, allograft, or xenograft. Autograft skin substitutes are harvested from another location of the patient's body. Allografts are harvested from a donor of the same species, and xenografts are derived from a different species such as porcine, bovine or piscine. These biologics may provide temporary coverage of the wound or may be resorbed and become a permanent part of the body. Skin substitutes ideally possess the composition and function of skin or have the potential to allow the body to heal itself (Shahrokhi, 2021). Autologous unprocessed allogeneic cadaver -derived skin grafts are established procedures for wound care. Autologous skin grafts, or autografts, refer to tissue transplanted from one location to another in the same individual. Autografts are referred to as partial -thickness or split -thickness graft. Autografts are ideal because there is no risk of rejection. In some cases, the area of healthy skin available for harvesting may be inadequate to cover the wound area. In these cases, the best choice is human skin taken from human cadavers, consisting of both epidermal and dermal grafts or temporary coverage of excised wounds. Cadav er skin grafts may be kept fresh for up to 14 days or may be cryopreserved or glycerol -preserved (GPA). Unprocessed cadaveric skin is a widely used skin substitute. Fresh pig's skin that has been specially treated and contains only the dermis layer has been used for coverage of partial thickness burns and excised wounds prior to grafting. There are various ways to sterilize and preserve pigskin. In general, the pigskin is treated with a solution (e.g., providine -iodine), placed in normal saline with an antibiotic, soaked in a solution to sterilize it, rinsed and refrigerated or frozen. Fresh skin stored in normal saline is viable for up to 72 hours. When autografts, unprocessed human cadaver skin or unprocessed pig's skin graft are not available, tissue -engineered skin substitutes which include processed human cadaver skin and pig skin may be an option (Wood, 2021; Ahmad et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2010; Paul, 2008). PureSkin is an example of an allograft that is available in fresh configuration or cryopreserved from, meshed and non -meshed. PureSkin is primarily used in burn patients to advance wound healing when autografting is not feasible (Allosource, 2017). Neomatrix is an example a cryopreserved allograft burn care (Maxxeus, 2021). Tissue-Engineered Skin Substitutes Tissue -engineered skin substitutes (i.e., human skin equivalents [HSE]), also referred to as artificial skin, are bioengineered skin products and may be either acellular or cellular. Acellular (i.e., cadaveric human dermis with cellular material removed) products contain a matrix or scaffold composed of materials such as collagen, hyaluronic acid, and fibronectin. The construction of the matrix allows easy access by host cells during the healing process. Cellular products contain living cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes within a matrix. The cells contained within a matrix may be allogeneic (i.e., obtained from another individual) or autologous (i.e., obtained from the same individual). Some products are derived from other species (e.g., bovine, porcine) a nd are referred to as a xenograft. Skin substitutes are generally comprised of epidermal cells, dermal cells or may be composites (i.e., a combination of dermal and epidermal). The substitutes can be used as either temporary or permanent wound coverings (Ho, et al., 2005; Sibbald, et al., 2005). Grafting techniques utilized to apply skin substitutes include autografting (i.e., tissue transplanted from one part of the body to another), allografting (i.e., transplant from one individual to another of the same species), and xenografting (i.e., a graft from one species to another unlike species). Skin substitutes have been proposed for the treatment of multiple conditions including burns (including acute or reconstructive), breast reconstruction and chronic wounds such as venous status ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers unresponsive to standard therapy. During breast reconstruction, acellular dermal skin substitutes (i.e., AlloDerm, AlloMax) are primarily used in the setting of tissue expander and breast implant reconstruction. Patients should be in overall good health and have no underlying condition that would restrict blood flow or interfere with the normal healing process (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, previous surgery). These matrixes may be indicated when there is insufficient tissue expander or implant coverage by the pectoralis major muscle and additional coverage is Page 26 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 required, as may be the case in a very thin patient; if there is viable but compromised or thin post -mastectomy skin flaps that are at risk of dehiscence or necrosis; or if there is a need to re -establish the inframammary fold and lateral mammary fold landmarks. When used in appropriate candidates, these skin substitutes are proposed to improve control over placement of the inframammary fold and final breast contour, enhance use of available mastectomy skin, reduce the number of expander fills necessary, reduce time to complete expansion and eventual implant exchange, potential improved management of a threatened implant, reduce the need for explantation and the potential for reduction in the incidence of capsular contracture. However, there are ongoing concerns regarding the increased risk of seroma and infection, a higher risk of an implant having to be removed, and tissue f lap death. A chronic wound is defined as a wound that does not heal in the time expected based upon the patient's age, comorbidities, and wound etiology. A wound that has not healed within 30 days to three months is considered chronic. Different types of chronic wounds include lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers, venous ulcers and burn wounds. Treatment depends on the type of wound, wound location, and wound size. The wound should be free of infection, coagulum, sinus tracts, tunnels, cellulitis, eschar and necrotic tissue. There should be no exposure of joints, tendons, ligaments or bone. Adequate blood supply to the affected area should be evidenced by a palpable pedal pulse or an ankle -brachial index (ABI) of 0.70. Standard wound therapy for a foot ulcer in a type 1 or type 2 diabetic includes avoidance of mechanical stressors on the ulcerated extremity (i.e., off -loading), wound cleansing and debridement, management of infection with antibiotic therapy and application of saline- soaked gauze. I t is essential that routine medical management of diabetes and the presence of a hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) of less than 12% be achieved to maximize complete healing of the wound. The mainstay of conventional wound therapy for lower extremity venous stasis ulcers is compression therapy (e.g., compression stockings, Unna boots, elastic wraps). Surgical debridement of the wound, zinc paste gauze and non- weight bearing regimens may also be used. Skin substitutes may be indicated for the treatment of a wound that is not healing in response to conventional therapy. The underlying medical condition, such as hypertension, should be adequately managed to foster complete healing. To date evidence is lacking supporting superiority of one product over another for the treatment of lower extremity wound therapy. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Depending on the purpose of the product and how it functions, skin substitutes are regulated by the FDA premarket approval (PMA) process, 510(k) premarket notification proces s, or the FDA regulations for banked human tissue. Products that are classified by the FDA as an interactive wound and burn dressing are approved under the PMA process as a class III, high -risk device and require clinical data to support their claims for use. These devices may be used as a long- term skin substitute or a temporary synthetic skin substitute. They actively promote healing by interacting directly or indirectly with the body tissues. Examples of these devices include Apligraf \u00ae (Organogenesis I nc., Canton, MA) and Dermagraft\u00ae (Advanced BioHealing, Inc., LaJolla, CA). Other wound care devices are approved by the 510(k) process, and their primary purpose is to protect the wound and provide a scaffold for healing. They may or may not be integrated into the body tissue. Some devices are rejected by the body after approximately ten days to several weeks and removed prior to definitive wound therapy or skin grafting. Integra Bilayer Matrix Wound Dressing (BMWD) (Integra LifeSciences Corp., Plainsboro, NJ) and Oasis \u00ae Wound Matrix (Cook Biotech, Inc., West Lafayette, IN) are examples of these devices. Donated skin that requires minimal processing and is not significantly changed in structure from its natural form is classified by the FDA as banked huma n tissue, is not considered a medical device, and does not require PMA or 510(k) approval. Donated skin is regulated by the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and the FDA guidelines for banked human tissue. AATB oversees a voluntary accreditation program and the FDA focuses on preventing the transmission of communicable diseases by requiring donor screening and testing. Tissue establishments must register with the FDA and list each cell or tissue produced. An example of a banked human tissue produc t is AlloDerm, an acellular dermal matrix (FDA, 2004). Page 27 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 In 2021, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding acellular dermal matrix (ADM) products indicating that higher complication rates may be present in certain ADMs used in implant -based breast reconstruction. ADMs are developed from either human (e.g., FlexHD, AlloMax, AlloDerm) or animal skin (e.g., SurgiMend) and have had the cells removed leaving behind the support structure for use. The FDA has not approved any ADMs for the indication of implant -based breast reconstruction. The FDA's safety communication cited a prospective corhort study evaluating safety outcomes (i.e., reoperation, explantation, infection) from implant -based breast reconstruction surgeries after mastectomy in multiple centers in the United States and Canada that showed significantly higher complication rates in patients with FlexHD and AlloMax ADMs two years after surgery compared to a control group that did not receive an ADM. The FDA pointed to a need for additional, high -quality studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ADMs. As a result of their analysis, the FDA has given the following recommendations for health care providers: \"Discuss the potential benefits and risks of all relevant treatment options with your patients as part of a shared decision- making process. Be aware that the FDA has not approved or cleared any ADM products for use in implant -based breast reconstruction. Data analyzed by the FDA and published literature suggest that some ADMs may have higher risk profiles than others. Be aware that the FDA does not recommend reoperation or removal of implanted ADM as a preventive measure. Report any patient adverse events to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the Reporting Problems with Your Device page\" (FDA, 2021). In June 2021, the FDA updated a July 2020 consumer alert on regenerative medicine therapies. These products require FDA licensure/approval to be marketed to consumers. These unapproved products include stem cells, stromal vascular fraction (fat -derived cells), umbilical cord blood and/or cord blood stem cells, amniotic fluid, Wharton's jelly, ortho- biologics, and exosomes. The warning included the statement that \"regenerative medicine therapies have not been approved for the treatment of any orthopedic condition, such as osteoarthritis, tendonitis, disc disease, tennis elbow, back pain, hip pain, knee pain, neck pain, or shoulder pain. \" Per the FDA, s afety concerns with these products included the following: \"Blindness; Tumor formation; Neurological events; Bacterial infections including life- threatening blood infections; Reactions at the site of collection and administration; Unwanted inflammatory or immune response to the cell or therapy; Cells moving to another part of the body and turning into an unintended type of tissue or excessively growing in the body (i.e., forming a tumor); Failure of the therapy to work as anticipated when approved treatments are available; Cross -contamination with bacteria, viruses or mold related to processing (preparation of the product) or the therapy not being tested for infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV. \" Skin Substitutes The safety and efficacy of the skin substitutes listed below are supported by the evidence in the published peer - reviewed scientific literature and/or are established treatment options for the discussed indications. AlloDerm\u00ae - Breast Reconstruction AlloDerm ( Allergan, Parsippany, NJ; human acellular dermal matrix allograft classified as banked human tissue by the FDA because it is minimally processed and not significantly changed in structure from the natural material. AlloDerm is an established treatment option and is supported by the evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature for tissue repair during postmastectomy breast reconstruction (Kim, et al., 2012; Jansen and Macadam, 2011; Nguyen, et al., 2011; Chun, et al., 2010; Spear, et al., 2006. Various forms of Page 28 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 AlloDerm are available including AlloDerm Regenerative Tissue Matrix, AlloDerm Select Regenerative Tissue Matrix and Select Restore Regenerative Tissue Matrix (AbbVie, 2023 ). AlloDerm - Other Indications AlloDerm has been proposed as a treatment option for various other conditions including: reconstruction after excision of skin and soft tissue malignancies, abdominal wall reconstruction and/or hernia repair, tympanoplasty, lower eyelid surgery , Frey's syndrome (a complication of parotid excision), cleft palate repair; various oral surgery procedures including gingival recession, empty nose syndrome, burns and postburn scar contractures and nasal contour deformities. In addition, been investigated for placement over implantable cardioverter -defibrillators and cardiac pacemakers to prevent skin erosion, scalp reconstruction and hand resurfacing. Studies are primarily in the form of case series or retrospective reviews with small patient populations (n=6 -58) and short -term follow -ups (e.g., 3 -68 months). Comparative studies to established therapies with randomization are lacking. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature to support the efficacy of AlloDerm for these indications. Abdominal Wall Reconstruction: Case series (n=10) (DeMoya, et al., 2008) and retrospective reviews (Lee, et al., 2009; Bellows, et al., 2007; Patton, et al., 2007; Schuster, et al., 2006) (n=18- 67) with 2 -16 months follow -up have evaluated the use of AlloDerm during contaminated abdominal wall reconstructive surgery. Diagnosis included infected fascia with dehiscence, complex ventral hernia, and dehiscence and/or evisceration. Typically the wounds were contaminated or dir ty. Hernia recurrence rates up to 64% were reported. Complication rates were as high as 43% and included wound infections, fistulas, wound dehiscence, graft infection, postoperative intra-abdominal bleeding, and evisceration. Some cases required repeat sur gery and/or removal of the AlloDerm. The authors reported that 100% of the patients experienced either significant abdominal laxity or a hernia following the application of AlloDerm (De Moya, et al., 2008); due to the high overall rate of hernia recurrence when the wound was left open, they could not support the use of AlloDerm unless the wound could be closed postoperatively (Shuster, et al., 2006); ongoing studies are required to address further refinements of surgical technique and to analyze long- term o utcomes related to the durability (Patton, et al., 2007); and lastly, long- term outcomes are unknown and are critical to \"fully establish the durability and functional properties of remodeling of AlloDerm grafts when used as tissue prosthesis during abdomi nal wall repair\" (Bellows, et al., 2007). Cleft Palate Repair: A systematic review of the literature included nine nonrandomized studies (n=166) that evaluated AlloDerm for cleft palate primary palatoplasty (n=92) and palatal fistula repair (n=74). There was insufficient evidence to support AlloDerm for this indication (Aldekhayel, et al., 2012). Frey's syndrome: Parotidectomy exposes the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers, which can cause severance and inappropriate regeneration. It is proposed that the syndrome is prevented by putting a barrier between skin and the auriculotemporal nerve to prevent the switched parasympathetic fibers from innervating the sweat glands or skin, thus preventing Frey syndrome. It has been proposed that All oDerm can alleviate the gustatory sweating associated with Frey's syndrome following parotid excision (Zeng, et al., 2012; Sinha et al., 2003; Govindaraj, et al., 2001). Zeng et al. (2012) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis of randomized and quais -randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of AlloDerm for preventing Frey syndrome after parotidectomy. Five studies (n=409) met inclusion criteria. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of Frey syndrome (objective or subjec tive). Secondary outcomes included facial contour, wound infection, rejection, seroma or salivary fistula and facial nerve paralysis. Meta- analyses of 2- 4 trials showed a significant reduction in objective incidence (p<0.00001) and subjective incidence (p< 0.00001) of Frey syndrome and salivary fistula (p=0.02). There was no statistically significant reduction in the incidence of facial nerve paralysis (p=0.51), incidence of seroma/sialocele (p=0.40) or improvement in facial contour. There were no significant differences in wound infection between the two groups and no cases of implant extrusion with AlloDerm. The authors noted that limitations of this study included: the number of studies contributing substantial data to the meta- analysis was small and the authors could not fully assess the effects of important clinical factors that may have influenced outcomes, possible problems with concealment, lack of blinding, loss of patients to follow -up and possible publication bias. Additional well -designed randomized controlled trials with large patient populations are needed to confirm the efficacy of AlloDerm for this subpopulation. Page 29 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Hernia Repair: Case series (n=11 Misra, et al., et al., 2007) and retrospective r eviews (n=37 -165) (Diaz, et al., 2009; Lee, et al., 2008; Jin, et al., 2007) evaluated the application of AlloDerm months. Compli cation rates were as high as 44%. Diaz, et al. (2000) reported a 17.1% overall hernia recurrence rate, 40% surgical site infections, intrabdominal abscess one study, seven of nine patients required reoperation due to postoperative abdominal wall laxity which was associated with infection and larger defects. Outcomes varied based on the type of surgical procedure performed, the type and number of AlloDerm sheets used, presence or absence of fecal contamination, and patient comorbidities (e.g., diabetes mellitus). The evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature does not support the efficacy of AlloDerm for hernia repair. Lower Eyelid Surgery: AlloDerm is proposed as an alternative to hard palate grafting used in the surgical repair of lower eyelid retraction following blepharoplasty. However, studies are primarily in the form of retrospective reviews with small patient populations and the authors reported less that beneficial clinical outcomes were not seen with the addition of AlloDerm (Li, et al., 2005; Taban, et al., 2005). Oral Surgery: AlloDerm has been proposed for closure of oral harvest sites, oral cavity recons truction, and the treatment of gingival recession. Studies are primarily in the form of case reports or case series with small patient populations. Published randomized controlled trials have included small, heterogeneous patient populations (e.g., n=10 -23) and short -term follow -ups. Overall, studies have not reported a significant difference with the use of AlloDerm for these indications. Jamal et al. (2010) conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare AlloDerm (n=10) closure to primary closure (n=10) of oral harvest sites for buccal mucosa grafts for urethroplasty. A single graft was harvested from one cheek. Based on questionnaire scores, there were no significant differences in postoperative oral pain, neurosensory deficits, or mouth tightness betw een the two groups. Although the difference was not statistically significant, there was a trend in the AlloDerm group toward more difficulty with mastication at three weeks, and three -, six-, and 12- month follow -ups. A significant difference was reported in cheek swelling at three weeks with 80% of the AlloDerm group compared to 30% of the primary closure group (p=0.01). The authors noted that AlloDerm offered no significant advantages when compared with primary closure and its use appeared to be an unnece ssary step. In a prospective nonrandomized study, Girod et al. (2009) compared the efficacy of AlloDerm (n=22) to split thickness skin graft (STSG) (n=12) in patients who underwent surgical resection of oral cavity tumors followed by reconstruction. The surgeries were performed by two different surgeons. The time from date of surgery to enrollment in the study was 22 months for the AlloDerm group and 12 months for the STSG group. There was a higher pre- and post -operative prevalence of radiotherapy exposu re in the AlloDerm (45%) compared to the STSG group (17%). A higher graft failure rate was seen in the AlloDerm group (14% vs. 0%), but was not statistically significant. There was a significant difference in the distribution of graft sites with more tongue patients in the AlloDerm group and more floor -of-mouth patients in the STSG group. AlloDerm grafts resulted in a more normal appearing mucosal surface. Although the AlloDerm patients scored higher on the Global Health Status, Functional, and Symptom scor es on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items/Head and Neck 35 (EORTC QLQ -C30/H&N35) tool, the differences were not significant. Histopathology comparisons (n=12) showed less fibrous tissue and keratinization of the epithelium in the AlloDerm patients. Mahajan et al. (2007), in a randomized controlled trial, evaluated the effectiveness of AlloDerm in the treatment of gingival recession. Fourteen patients were randomly assigned to the AlloD erm group (AlloDerm and coronally positioned the CPF (CPF alone; n=7). The defect coverage in the AlloDerm group was 97.14% compared to 77.42% in the CPF group, which was statistically significant (p<0.05). CPF produced statistica lly significant better results (p<0.03) in patient comfort. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the remaining clinical outcomes and overall patient satisfaction. A randomized study by Rahmani and Lades (2006) compared AlloDerm to conventional grafting. Fourteen patients with 20 gingival recessions of Miller's grade I and II were included in the study. Outcomes were measured at baseline and at six months after surgery and included: recession height, recession width, probing Page 30 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 depth, attached gingiva, keratinized gingiva, and clinical attachment level. Differences in the mean change between the two groups were not significant in any of the parameters. Gapski et al. (2005) conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis to compare the efficacy of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) (AlloDerm) based root coverage increase in keratinized tissues to commonly used mucogingival surgeries for the treatment of gingival recession and to increase the width of attached gingiva. Eight randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria. Four studies were eligible for comparisons between ADM -based root coverage and free autogenous connective tissue graft (CTG): two for comparisons between ADM based root coverage and coronally advanced flap (CAF) and two for comparisons between ADM -based augmentation of keratinized gingiva (KG) and free gingival graft (FGG). There were no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the outcomes measured (recession coverage, keratinized tissue formati on, probing depths, and clinical attachment levels). Due to the heterogeneity in study design and analysis and lack of data, meta- analysis could not be performed. AlloMax AlloMax Surgical Graft (Bard Davol, Inc. Warwick, non -cross -linked human dermis allograft. Because AlloMax is a natural human product it is classified as banked human tissue and does not require FDA approval. It is regulated by the American Association of Tissue Banks and the FDA guidelines for banked human tissue. T he AlloMax Surgical Graft for Breast Reconstruction (previously marketed as NeoForm ) is proposed for post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and is an established skin substitute for this indication (Bard, 201 7). The AlloMax Surgical Graft for Hernia and Abdominal Wall Repair is proposed for hernia or other complex abdominal wall repairs when a synthetic prosthesis is contraindicated or inappropriate (Bard, 2017). There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literatur e to support the safety and efficacy of AlloMax for hernia and abdominal wall repair. Studies have primarily been in the form of case reports for hernia repair (e.g., hiatal hernia, an acellular allogenic human dermal graft designed to support host tissue remodeling. AlloPatch Pliable is used as a wound care scaffold for the replacement of damaged or inadequate integumental tissue. Regulated under the FDA Human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue- based products , the graft is proposed for the treatment of acute traumatic wounds such as burns and penetrating trauma, surgical skin cancer wounds and scar revisions. Indications for the treatment of chronic wounds include: diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, pressure/decubitus ulcers and vascular arterial ulcers. It is a pre -hydrated matrix that comes in four sizes from 1.5x1.5 cm to 4x8 cm. ( (2017) conducted a multicenter, controlled trial to investigated the effectiveness of AlloPatch Pliable plus standard of care (SOC) (n=20) compared to SOC alone (n=20) in the treatment of nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). The objective of the study w as to compare complete wound healing at six weeks and twelve weeks. Selection criteria included: age 18 years; type 1 or type 2 diabetic, DFU of 4 weeks duration with failure to treatment; DFU 1 cm 2; no signs of infection, HBA1C < 12%; adequate circulation within past 60 days; dorsum transcutaneous oxygen test 30 mmHg; and ABI 0.7 and 1.2. Following a two- week screening period in which DFUs were treated with offloading and moist wound care, patients were randomized to SOC alone or AlloPatch plus SOC applied weekly for up to 12 weeks. Patients whose index wound had not healed greater than 20% at two weeks were randomized to the AlloPatch plus SOC or SOC alone group. Wounds were defined as healed if there was complete (100%) r e-epithelialization without drainage or need for dressing. For patients in the SOC group, daily dressing changes with a collagen -alginate were performed weekly. Overall, significantly better outcomes were reported in the AlloPatch plus SOC group. At six weeks 65% of patients treated with AlloPatch had healed compared with 5% of DFUs in the SOC alone group. Mean time to heal at six weeks was 28 day vs. 41 days in the SOC group. Ten patients from the SOC group (50%) and one patient from the graft group (5%) exited from the study at six weeks per protocol because their wounds failed to reduce by at least 50%. At 12 weeks 80% of the study group and 20% of the SOC group had healed (p=0.00036). Mean time to healing at 12 weeks was 40 days in the AlloPatch group and 77 days in the SOC group (p=0.00014). The mean number of grafts used to achieve closure was 4.7 per wound. Adverse events in both groups were related to foot infections and none were attributed to the use of the graft. Limitations Page 31 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 of the study include the small patient population, short -term follow -up and a larger mean wound area in the AlloPatch group (4. 7 cm2) compared with the SOC group (2. 7 cm2). AmnioBand\u00ae or Guardian AmnioBand or Guardian (Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF) , Edison, NJ), is an allograft made of human amnion and chorion and proposed as a covering for internal and external wounds. The product is regulated by the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and the FDA guidelines for banked human tissue. Although marketed under two different names, the products are exactly the same. The membrane is hydrophilic and can be used in a hydrated or dehydrated state. AmnioBand Membrane is used as a wound care scaffold for the replacement of damaged or inadequate integumental tissue such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, or for other homologous use. AmnioBand comes in 13 sizes ( MTF, 2023; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, 2014). Serena, et al. (2022) conducted a multicenter, randomized control t rial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of weekly (n=20) and biweekly (every two weeks) (n=20) applications of AmnioBand plus standard of care compared to standard of care alone (n=20) on chronic venous leg ulcers (VLU). Standard of care included the cleaning and debriding of the study ulcer, application of multilayer compression bandaging, and instructions to keep leg elevated and bandage dry. Inclusion criteria included: age 18 years; ankle brachial index (ABI) >0.75 2 cm2 but < 20 cm2 of a duration longer than one month that extended through the full thickness of the skin but not down to the muscle, tendon, or bone; study ulcer with a clean, granulating base with minimal adherent slough and treated with compression therapy for a minimum of 14 days prior to randomization. Patients were excluded if the ulcer was infected, suspicious for cancer, caused by a condition other than venous insuffic iency, required treated by negative- pressure wound therapy or hyperbaric oxygen therapy or had previously been treated with cellular and/or tissue- based products. Patients were also excluded if they had a history of HIV/AIDS, drug or alcohol abuse, radiati on therapy at the ulcer site, ulcers on the dorsum of the foot or with 50% of the ulcer below the malleolus, pregnant or breastfeeding, diabetes with HbA1c >12.0 within the past 90 days, renal dysfunction with serum creatinine levels 3.0 mg/dl within t he last 90 days, used tobacco within the last 30 days or had a history of liver disease with active cirrhosis. The primary endpoint was the proportion of ulcers achieving complete closure (defined as macroscopic wound closure at 12 weeks) using the Silhouette three -dimensional laser camera system by Aranz Medical (Christchurch, New Zealand). Secondary endpoints included the proportion of ulcers achieving 40 percent area reduction at four weeks and the incidence of adverse events. At 12 weeks, complete heali ng occurred in 75% (15/20) of the weekly AmnioBand group and in 75% (15/20) of the biweekly AmnioBand treatment group compared to 30% (6/20) of the SOC group (p=0.001). The percentage of ulcers achieving 40 percent area reduction at four weeks, w as 65% (13/20) in SOC group, 80% (16/20) in the group, and 70% (14/20) in the biweekly AmnioBand group. Thirty -eight adverse events occurred including nine serious adverse events. The most common types of adverse events were wound- related infections and formation of a new ulcer. None of the events was related to the study allograft or procedure. There were no amputations or deaths. An author noted limitation was the lack of blinding of patients and investigators to the treatment received. T he application of AmnioBand (either weekly or biweekly) in conjunction with standard of care improved outcomes in the treatment of venous leg ulcers when compared to standard of care alone. DiDomenico et al. (2016) conducted a multi -center, randomized co ntrolled trial to compare AmnioBand (n=20) to standard of care (SOC) (n=20) in facilitating wound closure in nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Included patients were age 18 years, type 1 or type 2 diabetic, had at least one unhealed neuropathic DFU 1 cm 2 with no sign of infection, had an HBA1c < 12%, and had failed conservative therapy for at least four weeks. Patient s also had adequate circulation to the affected extremity within 60 days of the study, as demonstrated by dorsum transcutaneous oxygen test 30 mm Hg; or ABI with results of 0.7 and 1.2; or Doppler arterial waveforms, which were triphasic or biphasic at the ankle of the affected leg. SOC included: off -loading, appropriate debridement, and moist wound care. During a two-week screening period, patients were treated with SOC. During the screening period, wounds were assessed and measured weekly and debridement was performed as necessary. If the index wound did not reduce by more than 20% in size at the end of the screening period, the patient was randomized to SOC or AmnioBand + SOC. Following randomization, each patient was treated weekly during the study period until the index wound closed or for 12 weeks. Wounds were defined as healed if complete (100%) epithelializat ion occurred without drainage and need for dressing, At six weeks, mean time to Page 32 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 healing with AmnioBand was 30 days vs. 40 days with SOC (p=0.00073) and 70% (14/20) of the AmnioBand group healed compared with 15% (3/20) of DFUs treated with SOC alone. At si x weeks eight SOC patients and one AmnioBand patient were withdrawn from the study because their wounds failed to reduce in area by at least 50%. Two DFU in the SOC group reopened after initial closure. Twelve weeks following treatment, 85% (17/20) of the Amnio Band patients were healed compared with 25% (5/20) in the SOC group. The mean time to heal was 36 days for AmnioBand and 70 days for SOC. The mean number of grafts used at 12 weeks was 3.8 (median 3.0). Four adverse events involved foot infection but were not found to be related to the graft. Limitations of the study include: small patient population, short -term follow -up; and mean wound size at randomization was larger in the SOC group (3.3 vs. 2.0 cm2). Apligraf\u00ae Apligraf (Organogenesis Inc., Canto n, MA) (also known as Graftskin), a bilayered living skin equivalent with bovine reagents, is FDA PMA approved for use in conjunction with compression therapy for the treatment of non- infected, partial and full -thickness skin ulcers due to venous insuffici ency and for full -thickness neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers nonresponsive to standard wound therapy. Based on the results of clinical trials, Apligraf may be appropriate when used for the treatment of type I and type 2 diabetics when the patient is under routine medical management and has a hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) less than 12%. The ulcer should be free of sinus tracts, tunnels, cellulitis, eschar and necrotic tissue. Adequate blood supply to the treated foot (i.e., palpable pedal pulse or an ankle -brachial index [ABI] of 0.70) is necessary for healing to occur. One application of Apligraf is initially indicated. If Apligraf coverage is less than 100% and the wound is not progressing, up to a total of four applications in a twelve week period of time may b e used (Organogenesis, 2021; FDA , 2000) . The safety and efficacy of more than five applications has not been reported in the published peer -reviewed literature. Apligraf is an accepted treatment modality for chronic noninfected, full -thickness lower extremity venous stasis ulcers of at least one month duration that are nonresponsive to medical management. The ulcer should be free of cellulitis, eschar, sinus tract s, tunnels, necrotic tissue and osteomyelitis and have adequate arterial blood supply to support healing as determined by a palpable pedal pulse or an ankle -brachial index (ABI) of 0.70. Apligraf is used in conjunction with standard wound care therapy. O ne initial application is used and the wound is observed to see if the graft adheres to the skin. If less than 50% adherence is observed, additional applications may be indicated for up to a maximum of four applications in 12 weeks. Any underlying medical condition that may deter healing should be adequately managed (Organogenesis, 2021; FDA , 1998). Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (DiDomenica, et al., 2011; Steinberg, et al., 1999; Falanga et al., 1998) support the safety and efficacy of Apligraf for these indications. Biobrane \u00ae/Biobrane\u00ae-L Biobrane/Biobrane- L (Smith and Nephew, Inc., Largo, FL) are synthetic, bilaminate, collagen- based compos ites. Under the FDA PMA approval, Biobrane is indicated for use as a temporary covering of partial -thickness, freshly debrided or excised burn wounds in the absence of coagulum, eschare and necrotic tissue. Biobrane -L is also a temporary covering used as an adjunct until autografting is clinically appropriate. Biobrane L is a less complex nylon fabric for use when less aggressive adhesion is needed ( Wound Reference, 2023). Randomized controlled trials and retrospective reviews support the safety and effectiv eness of Biobrane for the treatment of partial - thickness burns (Lang, et al., 2005; Lal, et al., 2000). Biobrane has also been proposed for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis, paraneoplastic pemphigus, dermabrasion, skin graft harvesting, laser resurfacing, and other types of chronic wounds that cannot be immediately closed (e.g., open sternotomy, v enous ulcers), but there is insufficient evidence to support Biobrane for these indications (Whitaker, et al., 2008). Cortiva processed by Tutoplast technology using low -dose gamma irradiation. The matrix is FDA regulated as human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue- based product ( 361 HCT/P) and proposed for the repair, replacement, reconstruction or augmentation of soft tissue, including supplemental support and reinforcement of soft tissue in breast Page 33 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 reconstruction and hernia repair. There are three products: Cortiva, Cortiva 1.0 m m an d Cortiva 1 mm tailored allogragft dermis. The matrixes are offered in regular and 1 mm thicknesses and supplied in a range of sizes from 2x4 cm to 16x 20 cm (RTI , Inc., 2023 ; CMS , 2015). Studies investigating the clinical outcomes of Cortiva are primar ily in the form of retrospective reviews with short -term follow -ups (Keifer, et al., 2016; CMS. 2015). Cortiva has evolved into an acceptable tissue substitute for breast reconstruction and a randomized controlled trial with short -term follow -up reported that outcomes with Cortiva were not inferior to outcomes using AlloDerm. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed literature to support the clinical effectiveness of Cortiva for all other indications. Parikh, et al. (2018) reported the outcomes of a phase 2 randomized controlled trial that compared outcomes following breast reconstruction surgery using Cortiva 1 mm allograft or AlloDerm Ready to Use (RTU) regenerative tissue matrix. The 16x8 cm graft was used as a sling to support tissue expanders placed in the submuscular location in one study arm, and prepectoral reconstructions with tissue expanders (TEs) or direct -to- implants (DTI) in a second study arm. The interim analysis of the submuscular reconstruction group is reported herein. Breasts reconstructed with AlloDerm RTU (n=17 patients; 28 Cortiva 1 mm (n=17 patients; 31 breasts) submuscular TE, completed the interim analysis. During the study a significant shift to prepectoral reconstructions was noted and the prepectoral arm of the study was added to optimize enrollment rates. Patients who underwent prepectoral breast reconstruction with either DTI or TE supported by a 20x16 cm ADM sheet were compared in a separate study arm. The decision to proceed with prepectoral or submuscular reconstruction with either a TE or DTI was determined preoperatively. Female patients, aged 22- 70 years old, undergoing immediate prosthetic reconstruction following therapeutic or prophylactic skin - or nipple -sparing mastectomy with a body mass index (BMI) less than 36 kg/m 2 were included. Excluded patients were those who were pregnant or breastfeeding immediately before mastectomy. The primary outcome measure was premature explantation of the TE before exchange, or unintended explantation of a DTI reconstruction during the first three months postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures included other complications (e.g., seroma, cellulitis, wound or ADM dehiscence, skin flap necrosis). Patients undergoing TE placement in either study arm were f ollowed until there was TE exchange with an implant, flap, or both, or there was premature removal of the device. Patients undergoing DTI reconstruction were followed for at least three months following surgery. Patients undergoing reoperation of the surgical site without device exchange or removal were kept in the study. Patients underwent planned exchange of TEs for implants or flaps within 145.6 \u00b1 51.6 days in the AlloDerm group and 167.0 \u00b1 61.5 days in the Cortiva 1 mm group (p=0.27), not statistically significant. Most patient were exchanged with breast implant alone, but 14.3% in the AlloDerm group and 26.6% in the Cortiva group (p=0.25) received an autologous flap, not statistically significant. There was no significant difference between the group in integration of the ADM to the mastectomy flap (p=0.69), in drain removal between the groups or in physical well -being, or satisfaction with information or plastic surgeon. A significant difference was seen in detectable seroma in the AlloDerm (n=3) vs. th e Cortiva group (n=0). Premature explantation was performed in no Alloderm breast vs. one breast with Coriva. The initial size of the TE selected was significantly larger in patients reconstructed with Cortiva 1 mm (p=0.02). The AlloDerm RTU group was comprised of a significantly higher proportion of patients who had never smoked ( p=0.009). This interim analysis of of submuscular reconstructions patients revealed no evidence of inferiority of outcomes of AlloDerm vs. Cortiva. Limitations of the study include the small patient population and short -term follow -up. DermACELL DermACELL (LifeNet Health\u00ae, Virginia Beach, VA) is an acellular human dermis allograft collagen scaffold proposed for the treatment of soft tissue injury including second and third degree burns, breast reconstruction, chronic non -healing wounds, dehisced wound sites and cosmetic reconstruction after traumatic burn injuries. DermaCELL AWM is proposed for the treatment of chronic wounds including diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), venous stasis ulcers (VSUs), arterial ulcers, pressure ulcers, dehisced surgical wounds, and traumatic burns. Dermacell AWM can be used over exposed tendon, bone, joint capsule, and muscle. The Matrix in available in 2X2 cm - 4X8 am unmeshed and 2X2 cm - 8X12 cm meshed. There is also an AWM porous matrix (LifeNet Health, 2023 ). LifeNet Health is registered with the FDA as an establishment producing tissue- and cellular -based products. MatrACELL \u00ae is a patented process that removes > 97% of donor DNA that renders DermACELL acellular. Terminal sterilization is performed by low dose gamma irradiation. In December 2014, Novadaq Technologies was appointed the exclusive worldwide distributor of DermACELL. The evidence in the published peer- reviewed Page 34 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 literature supports DermACELL for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcer s. The use of DermACELL for breast reconstruction has evolved into an accepted standard of practice. DermACELL has been proposed for the treatment of large, comple x diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) that probed to tendon or bone. Studies are primarily in the form of case series with small patient populations (n=47 ) (Cazzell, et al., 2019) . Evidence supporting DermACELL for the treatment of DFUs and all other indications i s lacking. Diabetic Foot Ulcer: Evidence in the published peer -reviewed literature support DermACELL for the treatment of partial and full -thickness diabetic foot ulcers. Walters et al. (2016) conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (n=168) to compare the safety and efficacy of DermACELL (n=53) to conventional therapy (n=56) and to Graftjacket (n=23) in a 2:2:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was assessment of complete reepithelialization with no drainage or dressing requirements with confirmation at two consecutive follow -up visits two weeks apart. The healing rate of wounds at 16 weeks and the percentage of reduction in wound size from baseline were also assessed. Patients were included in the study if they met the following: had a single, full -thickness target DFU, Wagner grade 1 or 2, a wound area 1 cm 2 or 25 cm2, wound depth 9 mm, and adequate circulation to the affected area. Adequate circulation within the past 60 days was defined as transcutaneous oxygen measurement of 30 mm Hg or mor e at the dorsum of the foot; ankle -brachial index ranging from 0.8 to 1.2; and/or least arteries. At 16 weeks, the DermACELL arm had a statistically significant higher propor tion of completely healed ulcers compared to conventional care (p=0.0385) and a nonsignificantly higher proportion than the Graftjacket group (p=0.1149). The DermACELL arm showed a greater average percent reduction in wound area than conventional care (p=0.0791) and Graftjacket (p=0.0762), but the difference was not significant. The use of the second application was at the investigator's discretion. Severe adverse events were similar among the three groups. Limitations of the study included the small patient population, short -term follow -up and the number of patients lost to follow -up (31%). Breast Reconstruction: Although the evidence supporting DermACELL for breast reconstruction is primarily in the form of case series and retrospective reviews, outcomes reported a significant improvement in time to drainage removal and fewer \"red breast\" episodes compared to AlloDerm (Pittman, et al., 2016). Zenn et al. (2016) reported that DermACELL was as good as AlloDerm RTU in the occurrence of postoperative infection, implant loss, seroma and hematoma. Other studies have also reported favorable outcomes with DermACELL (Chang and Liu, 2017; Bullocks, et al., 2014; Vashi, 2014). Therefore, DermACELL has evolved into an accepted skin substitute for breast reconstruction . Dermagraft \u00ae dermal substitute made from newborn foreskin tissue and approved by the FDA PMA process for the treatment of lower extremity full -thickness diabetic foot ulcers on the fore foot, toes or heal, of longer than six weeks' duration, that extend through the dermis, and are refractory to standard wound care management. Dermagraft is used as an adjunct to standard wound therapy for type 1 and type 2 diabetics who have an A1C of less than 12% and are being managed by routine medical care. The ulcer should be free of sinus tracts, tunnels, infection, redness, underlying osteomyelitis, cellulitis, eschar, necrotic tissue. Adequate blood flow to the affected foot (i.e., palpable pedal pulse or ankle- brachial index [ABI] of 0.70) should be present in order for healing to occur. When Dermagraft is indicated, treatment is li mited to one initial application. If evidence of healing is seen (e.g., signs of epithelialization and reduction in ulcer size) a maximum of eight applications for up to a total of 12 weeks are considered appropriate (FDA, 2001). The FDA Humanitarian Devic e Exemption (HDE) process for the treatment of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB) was withdrawn by the manufacturer. Randomized controlled trials and case series have demonstrated improved outcomes when Dermagraft was used for the treatment of these ulc ers (Marston, et al., 2003). Epicel Epicel (Genzyme Biosurgery, Cambridge, MA) is a cultured epidermal autograft (CEA) that is FDA approved under the HDE process for patients who have deep dermal or full -thickness burns comprising a total body surface ar ea of greater than or equal to 30%. It may be used in conjunction with split -thickness autografts or alone in patients for whom split -thickness autografts may not be an option (FDA, 2007). Epicel is FDA approved as a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) dev ice. Prospective comparative studies and case series support Epicel f or the treatment of burns (Carso n, et al., 2003 ; Munster, 1996). Page 35 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Epifix\u00ae EpiFix Amniotic Membrane amnion/chorion membrane (dHAM) processed by a patented Purion\u00ae Process. These processes are regulated by the FDA regulations and American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) standards. The allograft contains active growth factors (i.e., epidermal growth factor [EGF], transforming growth factor [TGF -, TRF fibroblast vascular endothelial cytokines 4] and interleukin 10 [IL- 10]), and structural is proposed to promote cellular migration to enhance soft tissue repair in acute and chronic wounds free of necrotic tissue and infection; partial - and full -thickness wounds; venous, diabetic, pressure, and chronic vascular ulcers; trauma wounds, including burns; and surgical wounds. EpiFix membranes/sheets come in 14 mm and 16 mm disks as well as, 2X3 cm, 4X4 cm and 5X6 mm sheets (MiMedx, 2021). Randomized controlled trials support EpiFix for the treatment diabetic foot ulcers and venous status ulcers. Studies reported significantly greater reduction in wound size and faster healing time (NICE, 2018; Bianchi, et al., 2017; Zelen, et al., 2016; al., Feb al., 2014; al., Apr 2014; Zelen et al., 2013). EpiFix \u00ae also comes in a micronized powder. Evidence for the effectiveness of EpiFix for all other indications and EpiFix Micronized Powder for all indications is Dermis: FlexHD Edison, NJ and Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) is a matrix derived from donated human allograft skin. The product is regulated by the American Association of Tissue Banks and the FDA guidelines for banked human tissue. The dermis is indicated for the replacement of damaged or inadequate integumental tissue or for the repair, reinforcement or supplemental suppor t of soft tissue defects. FlexHD is available in multiple sizes. Case series and retrospective reviews support the safety and efficacy of FlexHD for use during postmastectomy breast reconstruction. FlexHD is an established skin substitute for this indicati on (Liu, et al., 2014; Seth, et al., 2013; Seth, et al., 2012; Brooke, et al., 2012; Rawlani, et al., 2011; Cahan, et al., 2011; Topol, et al., 2008). The implantation of FlexHD has also been reported to aid in the rehabilitation of patients with empty nose syndrome in an attempt to provide resistance for breathing and decrease the sensation of suffocation (Chhabra and Houser, 2009). Data supporting the safety and efficacy of FlexHD for other indication from published clinical trials are lacking. Studies have primarily been in the form of retrospective reviews and case series with small patient populations. Bochicchio et al. (2013) conducted a prospective quasi -experimental time -interrupted series to evaluate the incidence of hernia recurrence in trauma or emergency surgical patients who were implanted with AlloDerm (n=55) or FlexHD (n=35). Patients had a large (> 200 cm2) complicated symptomatic (pain, discomfort) ventral hernia as result of surgery. The primary outcome was hernia recurrence (true or functional) at one year. By year one, all AlloDerm patients requested and required a second hernia repair. The mean hernia size in the AllloDerm patients wa s 402 cm 2 and the mean mesh size used to repair the defect was 318 cm2. Twelve of these patients were found to have intraoperative contamination at their first hernia repair operation and 33 had significant laxity (functional hernia recurrence) by six months postoperatively. A total of 17 patients had developed a functional recurrence by the one- year follow -up and five were diagnosed with a true recurrence confirmed at the time of the second hernia operation. AlloDerm complication ns included five seromas, seven intra -abdominal abscesses and two enterocutaneous fistulas. In the FlexHD group, mean hernia size was 388 cm 2 and the mean size of the mesh used to repair the defect was 389 cm2. At the one -year follow -up, three patients had a true hernia recurrence (i.e., through the mesh or through the mesh/fascial interface) and eight had significant laxity (functional hernia recurrence). Of the 11 patients, six patients with functional hernia underwent repair. Complications in the FlexHD group included ten wound infections, two enterocutaneous fistulas, three intra - abdominal abscesses and three seromas. The difference in the groups in complications was not significant. All AlloDerm patients required a second hernia operation vs. 31% of FlexHD patients. Three of ten FlexHD patients vs. all AlloDerm patients in the underlay arm group suffered recurrence by one year (p<0.001). The lowest recurrence rate was in the FlexHD overlay group (2/23) as compared to Alloderm (13/13) group (p<0.001). Overall, recurrence rates were significantly greater in all three AlloDerm technique groups at one year. The authors concluded that FlexHD appeared to have reduced the recurrence and laxity rates while maintaining a Page 36 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 similar complication profile when compared with AlloDerm. Limitations of the study include: the variation in surgical techniques within and between the groups, short -term follow -up, small patient population, and the study design having occurred during different time periods. Geistlich Derma -Gide\u00ae Advanced Wound Matrix Geistlich Derma -gide (Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland) is a collagen wound dressing derived from porcine tissue (mostly collagen Type 1) for covering and regenerating soft tissue defects or soft tissue wounds (Geistlich Pharma 2023 ). Geistlich Derma -Gide received 510(k) FDA (K182838) approval on Nov 8, 2018. It is proposed for use with partial and full thickness wounds, ulcers (pressure, venous, diabetic, chronic vascular), surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post Moh's surgery, post laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence) and trauma skin wounds (abrasions, laceration, second degree burns, skin tears). A randomized control trial and pilot study support the safety and efficacy of Geistlich Derma- Gide for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (Armstrong et al., 2020; Armstrong, et al., 2022) . Armstrong et al. (2022) conducted a multicenter, randomized control trial to compare the safety and effic acy of Derma -Gide, a purified reconstituted bilayer matrix (PRBM), to standard of care (SOC) (collagen alginate dressing) in the treatment of full -thickness, non- infected, non- ischemic (Wagner grade 1) diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Forty patients were inclu ded in an intent -to-treat (ITT) and per -protocol (PP) analysis, with 39 completing the study protocol (n=19 PRBM, n=20 SOC). The average age of patients in the PRBM group was 59.3 years and 66.5 years in the SOC group. The majority of patients were Caucasi an males. Patients were adults age 18 years, had an uninfected DFU Wagner Grade1 present for >4 weeks unresponsive to SOC prior to first visit that was sized between 1.0 cm\u00b2 and <25 cm\u00b2. Patients were required to have adequate kidney function, adequate circulation to affected foot and offload the affected target ulcer for 14 days prior to randomization. Patients were excluded if they had poorly controlled diabetes (HgbA1c >12) cancer, end -stage renal disease, ulcer not caused by diabetes, recent history of osteomyelitis, radiation or investigational drug use. The primary endpoint was comparison of percentage of wounds closed after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included assessments of complications, healing time, quality of life, and cost to closure. Patients were evaluated weekly until either complete healing of the index ulcer or for 12 weeks, whichever came first. Patients were followed for an additional two weeks after index ulcer was 100% reepithelialised. Using the ITT approach, after 12 weeks of treatment, complete healing of ulcers occurred in 85% (17/20) of PRBM group compared to 30% (6/20) of SOC group (p<0.001). In the PP analysis, wound closure occurred in 94% (16/17) of PRBM and 30% (6/20) of SOC group (p<0.001). Wounds healed at a faster rate i n PRBM group with complete wound healing at an average of 37 days compared to 67 days in SOC group (p=0.002). Healing rate in the PRBM arm at the 6- week mid -study point was 65% compared with 20% in the SOC arm. The mean percent area reduction (PAR) at six and 12 weeks for wounds treated with PRBM was 95% and 96%, respectively, compared with 24% and 9.8% for wounds in the SOC group. Patients reported 47% improvement in quality of life score in the PRBM group and 23% in SOC group. Both groups reported gradual decreasing VAS pain score over time. A mean of 5.2 (median 4; range 1 -12) PRBM grafts were applied to achieve wound healing. No adverse events (AEs) directly related to PRBM treatment were reported. Author noted study limitations include small patient population, the inclusion of only full -thickness, noninfected, non -ischaemic wounds; Placental Membrane (Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Columbia, MD is a subsidiary of Smith and Nephew ) is a cryopreserved, human placental, extracellular matrix, amnion or chorion collagen rich, that includes growth factors and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). It is proposed as the only commercially available placental membrane to contain viable endogenous cells (e.g., epithelial cells, fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells) which is accomplished using cryopreservation (Gibbons, 2015). The product is proposed for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds including: diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, deep tunneling wounds, burns, pyoderma gangrenosum, epidermolysis bullosa, surgical incisions, and surgical dehiscence. Grafix is regulated by the FDA as banked human tissue and Osiris is accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). Osiris also mar kets Grafix PRIME , Grafix CORE ) proposed to promote healing and tissue repair for chronic wounds, limb salvage procedures, tendon repair and burns. Grafix Core is a chorion matrix and Grafix Prime is an amnion mat rix, Available sizes include: 1 6 mm disc, 1.5X2 cm, 2X3 5 2021). Grafix PL Prime and GrafixPl Core are also are other configuration of the Grafix products intended for the same use. Grafix PL Membrane is lyopreserved and stored at room temperature (Smith and Nephew, 2023) . Page 37 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Multicenter r andomized controlled trials and technology assessments have reported that Grafix significantly improve s overall wound healing and shortens the time to wound healing for partial and full -thickness diabetic foot ulcers and has evolved into an accepted treatment option for a select subgroups of patient (Ananian, et al., 2018; Lavdry, et al., 2014). However, there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of Grafix for complex diabetic foot ulcers including exposure of muscle, tendon, fascia, bone and/or joint capsule. Published clinical trials have reported completed and faster healing of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) when Grafix was used as an adjunctive therapy with standard wound therapy (SWT) compared to SWT alone. Farivar et al. (2019) conducted a prospective case series to evaluate the effectiveness of Grafix for the treatment of venous leg ulcers (VLU) (n=21 patients; 30 VLUs). Inclusion criteria were : presence of superficial or deep venous reflux confirmed by duplex ultrasound; active chronic VLU that failed standard wound care therapy; no evidence of active or ongoing wound or systemic infections; no evidence of limb ischemia (ankle- brachial index <0.8); and not immunosuppressed (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus infection, organ transplant recipients, receiving chronic steroid therapy). Ten of the patients had diabetes. The primary outcome measure was complete closure of the index wound. Secondary end points were the percentage change in total ulcer area during the follow- up period and reduction in wound area with application of Grafix. Patients who did not heal after 12 weeks of standard wound therapy (SWT) began receiving SWT and one application of Grafix per week for up to 12 weeks. If the percentage take of the graft was <50%, another application to the ulcer site was applied. Ulcer sites with percentage take >50% did not undergo another application on that follow -up visit. No patient received more than 12 applications. After a mean follow -up of 10.9 weeks, mean wound size was significantly reduced with Grafix therapy (p=0.002). Of the VLUs that failed SWT, 53% (16/30) healed completely with the addition of Grafix with a mean treatment time of 10.9 weeks. Of the remaining VLUs that did not achieve complete wound closure, 57% (8/14 limbs) had >50% wound area reduction. On average, 79.2% wound surface area reduction was achieved with Grafix compared with 29.2% SWT only (p<0.001). Patients received a m ean 7.2 applications of Grafix and no ulcers recurred during the 12 weeks following healing. Limitations of the study include lack of a comparator and the small patient population. Additional case series (Reyzelman, et al., 2019) and retrospective reviews have reported 47% -67.6% complete closure within 12 weeks when Grafix therapy was combined with standard wound therapy (Ananian, et al., 2019; D'Costa and Kurtzl ., 2018, al., Regulski, et al., 2013). Osiris is proposing Grafix for the treatment of chronic, complex diabetic foot ulcers including exposure of muscle, tendon, fascia, bone and/or joint capsule. There is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of Grafix for complex diabetic foot ulcers. In a multicenter, prospective case series (n=31), Frykberg et al. (2016) evaluated the safety and efficacy of viable cryopreserved human placental (vCHPM) (GrafixCore) for the treatment of chronic complex diabetic foot wounds with exposed bone and tendon. Type 1 and type 2 diabetics, age 18- 85 years, with a complex diabetic foot wound 15 cm in longest diameter were included. The wound extended through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue with exposed muscle, tendon, fascia, bone and/or joint caps ule. Vascular parameters included: ankle- brachial index (ABI) 0.5 and 1.2 or toe systolic pressure 40 mmHg or transcutaneous tissue oxygen tension mmHg or skin perfusion pressure of >30 mmHg. The patients had significant comorbidities (hypertension, current or former smoker, heart disease and/or partial food amputation). Three patients had end- stage renal disease and were on hemodialysis. The primary endpoint was 100% granulation (i.e., complete coverage of the exposed tendon and/or bone with collagen -rich connective tissue) of the index wound by 16 weeks after the initial application of GrafixCore. Standard wound care (cleansing, debridement, absorptive foam dressings, off -loading devices) was also performed before and after application. Patients were treated with a weekly application of the graft for up to 16 weeks. If 100% granulation was achieved prior to 16 weeks, the patients continued to receive weekly applications until complete wound closure occurred for up to a maximum of 16 applications. By week 16, 96.3% of patients achieved 100% granulation of the index wound. An average of 6- 8 applications was required. In addition, 59.3% of patients achieved complete wound closure (100% reepithelialisation ) with an average of nine applications without the need for further amputation or surgical intervention. No adverse events related to the graft were reported. The authors noted that this was the first prospective study reporting outcomes for viable cryopreserved human placental for the treatment of complex diabetic foot ulcers. The incidence of amputation in this study group was Page 38 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 6.5%. Twenty -seven patients completed the study. Additional studies with larger patient populations are needed to validate the effectiveness of skin substitutes for complex diabetic foot wounds. GraftJacket NOW formerly GraftJacket\u00ae Regenerative Tissue Matrix (RTM) GraftJacket NOW formerly GraftJacket Regenerative (RTM) (Wright Group N.V. , Memphis , TN) is an acellular human dermal collagen template indicated for the repair or replacement of damaged or inadequate integumental tissue. GraftJacket NOW (GraftJacket Regenerative Tissue Matrix ) is regulated by the FDA as human tissue for transplantation and indicated for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. GraftJacket Regenerative Tissue Matrix MaxForce Extreme and GraftJacket Matrix Maxstrip are variations of the size and thickness of this tissue matrix. There are also products s pecific for other types of surgery including hand and shoulder surgery (Wright Medical Group N.V., 2020). Randomized controlled trials support the use of GraftJacket for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Compared to standard wound care, more patients healed within 6 -12 weeks with Graftjacket (Reyzelman and Bazarov, 2015; Reyzelman, et al., 2009; Brigido, 2006). Evidence in the published, peer -reviewed scientific literature supporting the use of Graftjacket for all other indication including breast reconstruction is lacking and its role is unclear. GraftJacket has been proposed for the repair of rot ator-cuff reparis, tendon tears, latissimus dorsi segment transposition, and lateral meniscal allograft resurfacing. Studies are primarily in the form of case reports and case series with small patient populations and short -term follow -ups (Sharma, et al., 2018; Strauss, et al., 2014 ). Marks et al. (2017 ) conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=60) to compare the 12-month postoperative Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) total score between patients with osteoarthritis (OA) at the first carpometacarpal (CMC I) joint who underwent trapeziectomy with suspension arthroplasty using the (FCR) tendon compared with those receiving Grafix. The authors reported that there was no clinically meaningful differences between the groups . Barber et al. (2012) conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=42) to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Graftjacket used in arthroscopic repair of large rotator cuff tears. Patients underwent repair of two- tendon rotator cuff tears measuring greater than three centimeters (cm) with (n=22) (group 1) and without Graftjacket (n=20) (group 2). Exclusion criteria included: irreparable massive rotator cuff tears measuring greater than five cm; subscapularis tendon disruptions; revision surgery; inflammatory or autoimmune diseases; evidence of active infection, cancer, or highly communicable diseases; and smokers. Follow -up ranged from 12- 38 months (mean 24 months). The primary outcome measure was the presence of retears independently seen on gadolinium - enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at least 12 months postoperatively. Secondary endpoints were clinical outcomes measured by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, Constant scores and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores. MRIs showed intact cuffs in 85% of group 1 (n=17) and 40% of group 2 (n=6), statistically significant (p<0.01). With Graftjacket, there was a significant improvement in the ASES score (p=0.035) and the Constant score (p=0.08). There were no significant differences in the UCLA scores between the two groups. No adverse events were attributed to the use of Graftjacket. Operative time was increased 30 -60 minutes with Graftjacket application. Limitations of the study include the small patient population, short -term follow -up, and loss of patients to MRI follow -up. Integra \u00ae Integra Dermal (Omnigraft), is a bovine, collagen-based temporary epidermal substitute that is FDA PMA approved for use in postexcisional treatment of l ife-threatening, non- infected full -thickness or deep partial - thickness thermal injury where sufficient autograft is not available at the time of excision or not desirable because of the physiological condition of the patient (Integra LifeSciences Corp , 2023; FDA , 2002). Subsequently Integra Template was approved for the repair of scar contractures when other therapies have failed or when donor sites for repair are not sufficient or desirable due to the physiological condition of the patient. In 2016 the Integra Dermal Regeneration Template (IDRT), was FDA PMA postexcisional treatment of life- threatening full -thickness or deep partial -thickness thermal injuries where sufficient autograft is not available at the time of excision or not desirable due to the physiological condition of the patient; repair of scar contractures when other therapies have failed or when donor sites for repair are not sufficient or desirable due to the physiological condition of the patient; and treatment of partial and full -thickness neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers that are greater than six weeks in duration with no capsule, tendon or bone exposed, when used in conjunction with standard diabetic ulcer care\". Because Integra is also offering the IDRT Page 39 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 under the product label Integra Omigraft Dermal Regeneration Matrix, Omnigraft was FDA PMA approved \"for use in the treatment of partial and full -thickness neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers that are greater than six weeks in duration, with no capsule, tendon or bone exposed, when used in conjunction with standard diabetic ulcer care\" (FDA, 2016). Integra Dermal Regene ration Template (IDRT) is supported by a multicenter (32 sites) randomized controlled trial (Driver, et al., 2015) for the treatment of non- healing diabetic foot ulcers. Significant improvments were reported following applications of IDRT in wound closure, physical functioning, pain and less chance of reoccurence. Most subjects required one application. Integra\u00ae Bilayer Matrix Wound Dressing, Integra Matrix Wo und Dressing, and Integra\u00ae Meshed Bilayer Wound Matrix, are substantially equivalent skin substitutes that are FDA 510(k) approved for the management of partial - and full -thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post -Mohs surgery, post -laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second- degree bums, and skin tears) and draining wounds (FDA, 2008). Case reports, case series, pilot studies and retrospective reviews have reported the application of Integra for the treatment of other conditions including: chronic wounds, giant congenital melanocytic nevi, scalp revision, dermatologic proce dures (e.g., removal of squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanomas, and keloids). Studies included small patient populations (n=8 -30), short -term follow -ups and did not compare Integra to standard methods of treatment. There is insufficient evidence in t he published peer-reviewed scientific literature to support Integra for the treatment of these other conditions. Neoform Dermis Neoform Dermis (Mentor Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) is a solvent -dehydrated, gamma- irradiated preserved human allograft dermis indicated for use as a soft tissue graft for horizontal and vertical soft tissue augmentation of thickness and length, such as breast reconstruction. NeoForm is classified as banked human tissue by the FDA. Although evidence in the published, peer -reviewed scientific literature supporting the use of this product in breast reconstruction is limited, Neoform Dermis is an established skin substitute used for tissue expansion in breast reconstruction following a mastectomy. Per the manufacturer, Neoform is no longer available for distribution. Oasis \u00ae Wound Matrix Oasis Wound Matrix (Cook Biotech Inc., West Lafayette, IN) is a porcine -derived, acellular collagen matrix. Oasis is 510(k) FDA approved for the management of partial and full thickness wounds i ncluding pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post -Mohs surgery, post -laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second- degree burns, skin tears), and draining wounds (FDA, 2006). The Oasis Ultra Tri -Layer Matrix incorporates three layers of the same structural components as the single layer matrix and is used in the treatment of larger wounds. Oasis is an established treatment option for partial or full -thickness diabetic foot ulcers of greater than four weeks duration. The diabetic patient should be participating in ongoing medical management and have an A1C of less than 12%. Oasis may also be used to treat venous stasis ulcers of one month duration that do not respond to standard wound care. The ulcer should be free of sinus tracts, tunnels, cellulitis, eschar and necrotic tissue. Viable tissue around the edges of the ulcer and the presence of adequate arterial blood supply therapy (i.e., palpable pedal pulse or an ankle -brachial index [ABI] of 0.70) are necessary for healing to occur. Randomized controlled trials and case series support Oasis for the treatment of chronic partial - and full -thickness lower extremi ty venous or diabetic foot ulcers when conventional wound therapy fails. The studies compared Oasis to standard wound therapy, Regranex Gel or hyaluronic acid dressing. Treatment with Oasis resulted in better outcomes and lower recurrence rates (Romanelli, et al., 2010; Romanelli, et al., LifeSciences, Princeton, NJ) is an acellular dermal tissue matrix derived from fetal bovine dermis. It is 510(k) FDA approved for the \"management of wounds that include: partial and full thickness wounds; pressure, diabetic, and venous second -degree burns; surgical wounds -donor sites/grafts, post 40 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Mohs surgery, post -laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence; trauma wounds -abrasions, lacerations, and skin tears; tunneled/undermined wounds and draining wounds\" (FDA, 2008). A randomi zed control trial, case reports, case series (n=20 -55) and retrospective reviews support the safety and efficacy of PriMatrix for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and venous stasis ulcers (Lantis, et al. (2021) conducted a multicenter randomized control trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a fetal bovine acellular dermal matrix (FBADM) (PriMatrix) plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC alone for treating hard-to-heal diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Participants (n=226) were included if they had confirmed diabetes type 1 or type 2 with HgbA1c < 12%, age 18 years or older, foot ulcer duration of at least two weeks, ulcer area between 1- 12 cm2 post-debridement, and adequate vascular perfusion. Exclusion criteria was active infection, including osteomyelitis; exposed capsule, tendon or bone; and reduction of wound 30% during the two week run-in period. Eligible patients who consented were treated with SOC for 2 weeks prior to randomization. SOC consisted of sharp debridement, infection elimination, use of dressings and offloading. The average age was 58.5 (SOC group) and 57.6 years (FBADM group) with 80.6% and 76.9% males. The majority of partic ipants were Caucasian at 71.2% (SOC) and (SOC) and 18.4% being Black/African ethnicity was reported in 29.8% (SOC) and 41.7% (FBADM). The primary outcome was complete wound closure at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes measured were differences in time to wound closure, weekly rate of wound closure over 12 weeks, and the incidence of adverse and serious adverse events. The study was terminated early due to the COVID -19 pandemic with 161 participants completing the study per protocol (FBADM n=79, without n=82). Complete wound closure occurred in 59.5% (47/79) of the FBADM group and 35.4% (29/82) of the SOC group (p=0.002). Of wounds that healed, median time to close was 43 days for FBADM group and 57 days for SOC group. The mean number of FBADM graft applications was 1.4. Adverse events were similar between groups and no product -related serious adverse events occurred. Author noted study limitations include short term follow up, inability to blind investigato rs or subjects to treatment type, and patient selection bias towards healthier patients. Suprathel \u00ae Suprathel\u00ae (PolyMedics Innovations Inc, Denkendorf, Germany) is a synthetic epithelial substitute made of polylactide, trimethylene carbonate, and s- capro lactone bioresorbable FDA 510(k) approved as a \"temporary coverage of noninfected skin defects, such as superficial wounds, under sterile conditions\". The Dressing is proposed for the management of the following: partial and full thickness wounds, pressure (stage I and IV) wounds, venous ulcers, ulcers caused by mixed vascular etiologies, venous stasis and diabetic ulcers, first - and second- degree bums, partial thickness bums, cuts and abrasions, acute wounds, trauma wounds, surgical wounds, superficial -wounds, grafted wounds and donor sites. Ideally, the graft remains intact until the wound is healed which is proposed to decrease pain associated with multiple dressing changes that may be required with other types of grafts. Sizes range from 5x5 cm to 18x23 et al., 2011; FDA, 2009). Suprathel has primarily been investigated for the treatment of superficial and partial -thickness burns. Comparative studies and multiple case series support the use of Suprathel for the treatment of burn wounds (Iqbal, et al., Highton, et al., a human skin allograft with epidermis and dermis layers. As a human skin product, TheraSkin is regulated by the American Association of Tissue Banks and the FDA guidelines for banked human tissue. Proposed indications for TheraSkin include ulcers (i.e., diabetic foot ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, stage II and greater pressure ulcers) and dehisced surgical burns with or without exposed tendon, muscle or bone. It is also proposed for the treatment of wounds that might otherwise require autografts. The allograft is to be used in conjunction with conventional therapies (Bioventus, 2022). Randomized controlled trials have reported significant improvement following treatment of partial and full -thickness diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers with TheraSkin ( Towler, et al., 2018; , et al., 2014; DiDomenica, et al., 2011). TheraSkin is an established human skin allograft for the treatment of diabetic and venous stasis lower extremity ulcers. According to the manufacturer, Theraskin is also proposed for the treatment of wounds with exposed muscle, tendon and bone. A retrospective review (WIlson, et al., 2016) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Theraskin on 15 patients with 15 lower extremity wounds of which eleven wounds had exposed bone, one Page 41 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 wound had exposed tendon and three wounds had exposed tendon and bone. Patients had diabetes (73%) with peripheral neuropathy (47%) and osteomyelitis (67%). The graft was applied following standard treatment. Fourteen of the wounds were reported to have healed completely within a mean duration of 19 weeks (range 53 - 311 days). The mean duration until there was coverage of the bone and/or tendon with granulation tissue was 36.14 days (range 5 -117 days). The mean number of grafts applied was two. No serious adverse events were reported. There was one minor amputation. The author's noted that to their knowledge, this was currently the largest study reporting on the utilization of allograft skin as an adjunct therapy for lower extremity wounds with exposed tendon and/or bone. Limitations of the study include the retrospective study design and the small patient population. Prospective studies with large patient populations are needed to support the effectiveness of skin substitutes for the treatment of complex, lower extremeity diabetic wounds. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature to support the efficacy of TheraSkin for any other indications including dehisced surgical wounds and pressure sores. TransCyte TransCyte (Smith & Nephew Inc., Largo, FL) (originally known as Dermagraft -TC) is a human, bilaminate, temporary skin substitute that is FDA PMA approved for the treatment of full - or partial -thickness burns. It is used as a temporary wound covering until autograft is possible. The wound is surgically excised prior to application of TransCyte. Randomized controlled trials and prospective case series support the safety and efficacy of TransCyte for the treatment of this type of burns (Amani, et al., 2006; Kumar, et al., 2004, Lukish, et al., 2001). Other Skin Substitutes Additional skin substitutes have been proposed for the treatment of multiple conditions as discussed below, but the evidence in the published peer- reviewed scientific literature does not support the safety and efficacy of the use of these substitutes for any indication. The number of available studies is limited and involves small, heterogeneous patient populations, short -term follow -ups, minimal comparisons to the established treatment method for the condition, and/or lack of a control group. In some cases, reported outcomes are inconsistent, and a consensus on patient selection criteria and the appropriate surgical approach and techniques that should be used have not been established. AC5 \u00ae Advanced Wound System AC5\u00ae Advanced Wound System (Arch Therapeutics, Inc., Framingham, MA) is a topical gel that is made up of synthetic, biocompatible and resorbable peptides. Once reconstituted and applied, the gel self -assembles into a nanofiber network which resembles the construct of the extracellular matrix. AC5 is completely non -animal and non-plant derived, and contains no preservatives. It is intended for the management of partial and full -thickness wounds, such as pressure sores, leg ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and surgical wounds. AC5 Topical Gel received FDA 510(k) clearance on December 14, 2018 (K182681) with a subsequent 510(k) issued on March 11, 2020 (K190129) to add an additional manufacturing process and manufacturer (CMS, 2022).

The kit includes: one 3 mL syringe with Luer -Lok tip; one vial of lyophilized peptide; vial of sterile water for injection; USP two 18- gauge, 1.5 inch needles; one 18- gauge 1.5 inch blunt fill needles; and two alcohol prep pad wipes (CMS, 2022). There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature to support the efficacy of AC5 Advanced Wound System for any indication. Actigraft \u00ae Actigraft (RedDress\u00ae, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL) is a regenerative wound care product that creates in vitro blood clots from a patient's whole blood. It is proposed that applying the blood clot to the site of the wound recreates the natural wound healing envir onment and promotes the body's own healing process. ActiGraft is topically applied for the management of exuding cutaneous wounds, such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and mechanically or surgically- debrided wounds (RedDress, 2020). The RD2 system (a peripheral blood processing device for wound management) received 510(k) approval (BK190349) on Nov 8, 2019. The RD2 System is a kit that contains three components for drawing and handling autologous blood and allowing it to clot in a controlled manner in order to form the provisional wound matrix. The system includes : blood withdrawal kit, coagulation initiator component, and a clotting tray containing coagulation accelerator. There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of Actigraft for wound management. Studies are in the form of case studies .

Acuseal Cardiovascular Patch The Acuseal Cardiovascular Patch ( cardiovascular patching; reduces bleeding through suture holes\". The patch is a polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) with an optional additional interpositional layer or layers of a fluoropolymer material. The additional material is proposed to reduce suture hold bleeding (FDA, 1999). The manufacturer proposes that the ePTFE properties are less thrombogenic than bovine collagen coated/sealed Dacron \u00ae material and result in a lower rate of restenosis. The Patch is available in three sizes for vascular (1 x9 cm, 0.8x7.5 cm, 2.5 x15cm) and cardiovascular use (3x6 cm, 5 x7.5 cm, 3x3 cam) (Gore, 2022 ). There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of the Patch. Adherus Dural Sealant \u00ae The Adherus Dural Sealant system ( manufactured by HyperBranch Medical Technology, Inc. Durham, NC distributed by Stryker ) is a synthetic hydrogel sealant proposed for use as an adjunct to standard methods of dural repair (e.g., sutures) to prevent spinal fluid leakage in cranial and spinal surgery. The sealant is also proposed to minimize dural adhesions and scarring. It is designed for neurosurgical procedures when only a small amount of material is required to close a durotomy. The product comes in a syringe and is reconstituted prior to use. The hydrogel is absorbed by the body over a 90 day period as healing occurs. Adherus sealants also include the Adherus AutoSpray Dural Sealant. According to the manufac turer, a randomized clinical trial has been completed and will be submitted to the FDA as part of the PMA process ( Stryker , 2022 ).

Snyder et al. (2016) conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AmnioExcel plus standard of care (SOC) (DAMA+SOC) (n=15) vs SOC alone (n=14). Patient characteristics included: type 1 or type 2 diabetics; with one or more Wagner grade 1 or superficial 2 foot ulcer, measuring between 1- 25 cm 2 in area, presenting for more than one month with no signs of infection/osteomyelitis; ABI > 0.7; HbA1c < 12%; and serum creatinine < 3.0 mg/dL. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of subjects who achieved complete wound closure prior to or on week six after initiation of treatment. Following a two-week screening period, subjects received treatment for six weeks or until complete reepithelialization without drainage or need for dressings (complete wound closure) occurred. SOC included debridement of Page 46 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 necrotic/nonviable tissue and hemostasis , moist wound dressings, offloading where appropriate, infection surveillance, and weekly dressing changes, inspection, and debridement, and in the study group application of DAMA. A nonadhesive dressing and compression bandage were also applied. DAMA appl ication was determined by the investigator based on ulcer appearance and clinical judgment. The study group received a mean 4.3 \u00b1 1.7 pieces of DAMA applied weekly. A total of 33% of DAMA+SOC subjects achieved complete wound closer at or before week six compared to 0% of SOC subjects (p=0.017). DAMA patients achieved significantly faster wound closure compared to SOC alone (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference in adverse events (infection, bleeding, osteomyelitis). The authors noted that although the study suggested that DAMA is safe and effective in the treatment of DFUs, additional research is needed. Limitations include: subjects lost to follow -up (n=4 in each group); small patient population and short -term follow -up.

AmnioFix injectable which is a powder form is intended for the treatment of tendon and soft tissue AmnioFix Sports Me d and AmnioFix Wrap are for nerve and tendon protection (MiMedx, 2016, 2014). There is insufficient evidence in the peer -reviewed literature to support the safety and efficacy of Amniofix products. Cazzell et al. (2018) conducted a multicenter, randomiz ed controlled trial (n=145 ) to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a micronized dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) injection (Amniofix) for the treatment of plantar criteria were: age 21 med diagnosis of PF for 1-18 months; VAS pain sale of 45 at time of randomization; and had undergone conservative treatment for 30 days (rest, ice, compression, and elevation [RICE]; stretching exercises; nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and/or orthotics). Patients were excluded if they had trauma or previous surgery to the affected area; bilateral PF; prior use of lower limb injection therapy; diabetes and multiple other comorbidities and contraindications. Patients were randomized to rec eive one injection of Amniofix (n=73) or sodium chloride placebo (n=72). The primary outcome was the mean change in the visual analog scale (VAS) score between baseline and three months post -injection. Secondary outcome was mean change in Foot Function Index - Revised (FFI -R) score between baseline and three months follow -up. Overall, at the 3- month follow -up, 60 subjects in the treatment group compared to 34 control subjects reported at least a 50% reduction in VAS scores from baseline. VAS scores in the tre atment group were 76% lower compared with a 45% reduction in mean VAS scores for controls (p<0.0001). Compared to baseline the FFI -R scores for treatment subjects showed a significant mean reduction (p=0.0004) of 60% compared to a 40% reduction in the control group at the 3- month follow -up. Control group subjects reported a reduction in pain and improved function over time. No serious adverse events were related to the study. Two cases of post -injection pain at the injection site and one case of post-injection itching were considered normal events. Limitations of the study include the small patient population and short -term follow -up. It is unknown if additional injections would be effective for persistent sympt oms. Three Amniofix and two control subjects did not complete the three month follow -up and the last observation data was carried forward to the three -month analysis. Zelen et al. (2013) conducted a feasibility single -center randomized controlled trial t o examine the effectiveness of AmnioFix injectable amniotic membrane for the treatment of refractory plantar fasciitis (n=45). Recruited patients were 18 years or older and were recalcitrant to three of the following treatments: rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE); corticosteroid injection; stretching exercises; nonsteroidal oral anti -inflammatory agents; Page 47 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 and orthotics. Patients were randomized to standard care, 2 cc injection of 0.5% Marcaine plain, then 1.25 cc saline AmnioFi x, or 1.25 cc AmnioFix (n=15 per group). Follow -ups occurred for eight weeks. At one week significant improvement in plantar fasciitis symptoms was observed in patients receiving Amniofix injection compared to those receiving saline injections. There was a significant improvement in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hindfoot scores at one week and at eight weeks follow -up in each group (p<0.01, each) . The significant difference was greater in the AmnioFix groups vs. control (p<0.001) . No significant differences in outcomes were noted in those who received 0.5 cc Amniofix vs. 1.25 cc. Overall, at weeks 1 -8, AmnioFix subjects demonstrated statistically significantly lower median Wong -Baker FACES pain scores scores compared to the control group (p<0.001) . No adverse events related to AmnioFix were reported. Limitations of the study include the short -term follow -up and small patient population.

Page 51 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Herman and Ilyas (2019) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to compare safety and effectiveness of direct repair (neurorrhaphy), autograft, allograft, and conduit repair in digital nerve repair. A total of fifteen studies were included: four on neurorrhaphy (three prospective [n=12- 81], one retrospective [n=63]); four on allograft repair (three prospective [n=5 -72], one retrospective [n=24]); six on autograft repair (five prospective [n=15 -31], one retrospective [n=15]) and five on conduit repair (three prospective [n=7- 35], two retrospective [n=12 -16]). Inclusion criteria wer e observational cohort studies and randomized control trials on patients undergoing surgery for digital nerve lesions that reported a minimum of two of the following outcome measures: static 2 -point discrimination (S2PD), moving 2- point discrimination (M2P D), Semmes -Weinstein monofilament testing (SWMF), and complication rates. Studies were excluded if they included pediatric patients, peripheral nerves other than the hand, or used other surgical repair techniques. The mean length of follow up varied: neurorrhaphy (13.3 months), allograft repair (9.4 months), autograft repair (23.2 months), and conduit repair (21.1 months). Static 2 -point discrimination outcomes: neurorrhaphy 15% 6mm, 59% 6- 15 mm, 22% > 15 mm. The autograft repair was statistically superior 0.005), and neurorrhaphy as follows: neurorrhaphy 67% < 3mm (excellent), 0% < 3 mm, 67% 4 -7 mm, 33% > 7 mm. There was no statistical difference between direct repair and allograft repairs (p=.60), however both were statistically superior to conduit (p< 0.0001). SWMF sensation, 85% diminished light touch; and conduit 7% normal sensation, 40% diminished light touch. Allograft adverse events included prolonged pain, effusion or wound exudate greater than two weeks. Autograft complications were reported as donor site complications. Conduit repair adverse events included infection and prolonged pain. No adverse events were reported for neurorrhaphy. Limitations of the study include heterogeneity of the studies , inclusion of retrospective study designs, small pat ient populations and short term follow ups. Well -designed comparative studies with large patient populations and long- term follow -up are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of allografts in digital nerve repair. Mauch et al . (2019) conducted a sy stematic review of the literature to compare the safety and efficacy of nerve autografts, processed nerve allografts (PNA) and conduits to primary repair (PR). Four studies were identified using autografts including one comparative study (n=12), two observ ational studies (n=11, n=15), and one retrospective (n=14). Four PNS studies included: one observational study (n=14), one pilot study (n=14), one retrospective comparative study (n=24), and one case series (n=5). There were f ive studies identified on nerve conduit reconstruction including two prospective cohort studies (n=40, n=12), two prospective observational studies (n=9, n=19) and one pilot study (n=14). Seven retrospective reviews (n=15- 150) on PR were included. Studies on traumatic digital nerve injuries repaired with PR, nerve autograft, PNA, or nerve conduit were included. Studies were excluded if they were prior to 1990, had follow -ups less than six months, were case reports, or on PNA that were not commercially available. Primary outcomes measured included: static 2-point discrimination (S2PD), the British Medical Research Council Scale (BMRC), or Semmes -Weinstein (SW). Static 2 -point discrimination measures the ability to localize two points of pressure on the skin and identify them as dis crete sensations. Normal is less than 6 mm, fair 6 -10 mm, poor 11- 15 mm, protective - one point perceived, anesthetic - no points perceived. The British Medical Research Council Scale is as follows: S0: absence of sensibility in the autonomous area; S1: reco very of deep cutaneous pain sensibility within the autonomous area of the nerve; S2: recovery of some degree of superficial cutaneous pain and tactile sensibility within the autonomous area of the nerve; S3: return of superficial cutaneous pain and tactile sensibility throughout the autonomous area, with disappearance of any previous overresponse; S3+: return of sensibility as in S3; in addition, there is some recovery of 2- point discrimination within the autonomous area (7- 15 mm); S4: complete recovery (2- point discrimination, 2 -6 mm). The Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments are a discriminative test used to assess the threshold stimulus necessary for perception of light touch to deep pressure. Follow up ranged from 12- 42 months. Results of the S2PD in the autog rafts studies reported < 15 mm (64 -100%) and 0-36% reported > 15 mm. Two studies reported a mean of 5.92 mm and 7.06 mm. All PNA studies reported S2PD < 15 mm. Two studies reported 80% and 83% S2PD < 6 mm. The nerve conduit studies reported 63% - 100% of patients with S2PD < 15 mm, the mean ranged from 5.2 mm to 8 mm. A S2PD > 15 mm occurred in 0%-38% of patients. The primary repair group reported 30% -100% S2PD < 15mm with a mean of 8.9 and 10.6 mm. Between 9% -70% reported S2PD > 15 mm. Autograft studies reported 75% -100% regained BMRC S3+ or Page 52 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 above. Sensibility of S2 or # occurred in 6%- 16%. No return in sensation was reported in 6% -8%. The PNA reported 16%, 0%. In the nerve conduit studies, BMRC of S3+ or S4 was reported in 75% -78%. Complete loss of sensation was reported in 17- 22% with 0-8% returning to S2. Primary repair reported 0- 2% with no return of sensation, 0- 68% between S1- S3, and 30-100% with S3+ -S4. SW results in the autograft group reported 86- 100% with normal or diminished light touch and 0- 13% with diminished protective sensation. No reports of loss of protective sensation or anesthetic sensation. The PNA group reported 0 -78% with normal sensation or light touch, 6- 60% diminished protective sensation, and 0-40% with loss of protective sensation. One study reported 17% anesthetic sensation. In the nerve conduit studies, 36- 78% reported diminished light touch, 22- 54% diminished protective sensation or loss of protective sensation and 0- 22% with anesthetic sensation. Only two studies in the PR group reported SW outcomes: 0% and 5% anesthetic sensation, 23% and 37% diminished protective sensation or loss of protective sensation, and 63% and 72% with diminished light touch or normal sensation. Adverse events include infection (two in PNA and one in nerve conduit) and neuromas (four in autograft and two in PR group). The nerve conduit studies reported two amputations, one extrusion, and seven removals. Study limitations include heterogeneity of the studies, inclusion of registry data, retrospective reviews, a case series, small patient populations and short term follow up. Studies with a large patient populations and long- term follow -up are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of allografts in the treatment of digital nerve injuries. Avive \u00ae Soft Tissue Membrane Avive Soft Tissue Membrane (Axogen, Alachua, FL) is a minimally processed human umbilical cord membrane propo sed for use as a homologous, resorbable soft tissue covering to separate tissue layers.

Biodesign \u00ae Dural Graft Biodesign\u00ae Dural Graft (Cook\u00ae Biotech Inc., Lafayette, IN) is a porcine, small intestinal submucosa ( SIS), bioabsorbable, extracellular collagen matrix. It is FDA 510(k) approved for use as a dura substitute for the repair of dura mater (K131015) . The FDA approval was based on predicate devices and an animal study. The matri x is available in four sizes (2x 3 cm, 4 x 7 cm, 7 x 10cm, 7 x 20 cm ) (Cook Biotech, 2022; FDA . 2013). There i s insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of Biodesign Dural Graft for a dural Fistula Plug (Cook\u00ae Biotech Inc., West Lafayette, IN) is a porcine -based acellular matrix and is contraindicated in patients who are sensitive to porcine materials (Cook Biotech Inc., 2022 ). The Surgisis AFP (i.e., SIS Fistula Plug) received 510(k) approval (K050337) from the FDA in March 2005 for \"implantation to reinforce soft tissue where a rolled configuration is required, for repair of anal, rectal, and enterocutaneous fistulas.\" Page 55 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature does not support the safety and efficacy of the Surgisis AFP. Studies have primarily been in the form of case series and retrospective reviews with small, heterogeneous patient populations, and short -term follow -ups (Schwandner, et al. 2009; Zubaidi 2008; Thekkinkattil, et al., 2008). Randomized controlled trials have reported no significant difference with the use of Surgisis AFP or worse outcomes . Appropriate candidates for AFP have not been established. Outcomes varied based on the type of fistula, the presence of single vs. multi -track fistula, and whether or not the patient had undergone previous fistula surgical procedures. Poorer results were r eported in patients who were smokers, diabetics, and/or had Crohn's disease. Failure rates were reported as high as 59% and recurrence rates as high as 75%. Some studies reported a decline in the success rate over time. One of the most common reasons for f ailure was due to plug expulsion. Studies also reported the occurrence of postoperative sepsis as high as 89%. Jayne et al. (2021) conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing safety, efficacy, and cost - effectiveness of the Surgisis anal fistula plug with other surgical treatments (surgeon's preference) for the treatment of transsphincteric anal fistula. Participants (n=304) were randomized plug (n=152) or surgeon's preference (n=152) (advancement flap, cutting seton, fistulotomy, Ligation of the Intersphincteric Fistula Tract procedure). Participant median age was 45.1 years with 55% being males. No difference in co- morbidity between the groups. At the 12 month follow up, there were no significant differences in faec al incontinence quality of life (FIQoL) scores between the two groups and clinical fistula healing was similar between the two groups: 54% fistula plug and 55% surgeon's preference. No significant difference in fecal incontinence rates (p=0.48). Infective complication rate was 50% in fistula plug group versus 38% in the surgeon's preference group at 12 months. Author noted study limitations include the small patient population and short -term follow -up. Van Koperen et al. (2011) conducted a double -blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to compare Surgisis (n=31) to a mucosal advancement the treatment of cryptoglandular high transsphincteric perianal fistulas. At the 11- month median follow -up, the recurrence rate was not significantly different (p=0.126) between the two groups with fistula plug patients and 15 mucosal advancement flap patients experiencing recurrence. There were also no significant differences in postoperative pain, pre - and postoperative incontinence scores, soiling and quality of life. There were no intraoperative complications and one postoperative complication in a fistula plug patient and two complications in advancement flap patients. Limitations of the study include the small patient populati on and short -term follow -up. In a randomized controlled trial, Ortiz et al. (2009) compared the outcomes of Surgisis AFP (n=16) to endorectal advancement flap (ERAF) (n=16) for the treatment of patients with high fistula in ano of cryptoglandular etiology. Sixteen patients had previously undergone ERAF. Recruitment was stopped because of the high recurrence rate following AFP. Follow -up evaluations were performed by an independent observer for up to one year postoperatively. Within the first postoperative year, a statistically significant difference was seen in 12 AFP patients who had fistula recurrence compared to two ERAF patients (p<0.001). Nine of 16 patients who had undergone previous surgery, experienced fistula recurrence, and eight of the nine were in the AFP group. Postoperatively, one AFP patient experienced recurrence with abscess, three had plug dislodgement, and eight had persistent leakage around the plug. Two ERAF patients experienced recurrences. In this study, AFP was associated with a low rate of healing especially in patient with previous fistula derived from a porcine source and proposed for implantation to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists including paraesophageal/hiatal hernias. Per the FDA 510(k) (2006) approval for SIS Hernia Repair Device and Surgisis Gold Hernia Repair Graft, the devices are \"intended to be implanted to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists. Indications for use include the repair of a hernia and body wall defect.\" There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature to support the safety and efficacy of Surgisis Hiatal Hernia Graft. Studies are primarily in the form of case reports, retr ospective reviews and case series with small patient populations (n=5 -6) and short -term follow -ups, reporting a high hernia recurrence rate. Oelschlager et al. (2006) conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the outcomes of paraesophageal herni a repair with primary repair (n=57) to primary repair with Surgisis (n=51). At the six -month follow -up, four Page 56 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 SIS patients and 12 primary repair patients developed a recurrent, > 2 centimeter hernia (p=0.04). There were no significant differences in operati ve times and perioperative complications. Both groups experienced significant improvement in heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, chest pain, early satiety, postprandial pain and improved quality of life symptoms following surgery with no significant differences between the groups. Limitations of the study include the small patient population, short -term follow -up and the lack of follow -up data on 18 patients (i.e., seven incomplete questionnaire data and eleven did not have an x -ray). Device, Surgisis Gold Hernia Repair Graft) (Cook\u00ae Biotech Inc., West Lafayette, IN) is a porcine derived device. Per the FDA 510(k) (2006) approval for SIS Hernia Repair Device and Surgisis Gold Hernia Repair Graft, the device is \"intended to be implanted to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists. Indications for use include the repair of a hernia and body wall defect.\" There is insufficient data from c linical trials to support the efficacy of this matrix. Studies are primarily in the form of case reports and case series with small patient populations (n=5- 67) and short -term follow -ups. Ansaloni et al. (2009) conducted a blinded, randomized controlled trial to compare the safety and efficacy of the use of Inguinal Hernia Matrix (SIHM) (n=35) to polypropylene repair of noncomplicated, primary inquinal hernias in men. The primary endpoint was the degree of postoperative pain using a visual analogue scale or a simple verbal scale. The investigators were unaware of the mesh used. The first 24 postoperative hours a significant number of patients in the SIHM group developed self -subsiding hyperpyrexia (temperature > 38\u00b0) compared to the polypropylene group (p<0.05). During the three year follow -up period, a significant decrease in the incidence of postsurgical pain was not seen in the SIHM group, but a significantly lower degree of pain was detected at rest and on coughing at 1, 3, and 6 months, on movement at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years, and use of pain medication at 1, 3, and 6 months (p<0.05, each). No significant differences were noted in pain localization and irradiation. One recurrence was noted in the polypropylene group. Both groups experienced hematomas and seromas that resolved without treatment within the first three postoperative months. The SIHM group had a trend in higher incidence of complications (especially seromas), but compared to the polypropylene group the difference wasn't significant. The authors noted that their sample size was \"too small to prove absolute efficacy in terms of low recurrence rate\". Additional prospective studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of Inguinal Hernia Mat rix. (Cook\u00ae Biotech Inc., West Lafayette, IN) is a surgical mesh skin substitute manufactured from porcine small intestinal submucosa. It is supplied in a tapered configuration with a button to allow increased retention. The button eventually falls off leaving the plug to seal the opening between the rectum and the vagina.

The predicate device is the original SIS Fistula Plug 510(k) (K050337), cleared for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration on March 9, 2005. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature to establish the safety and efficacy of Surgisis RVP. Studies are primarily in the form of case series with small patient populations and short - term follow -ups (1- 21 weeks). Failure rates were as high as 65% due to dislodgement of the plug (Gonsalves, et al., 2009).

There are conflicting outcomes regarding the clinical effectiveness of these grafts in the treatment of Peyronie's disease and (Cosentino, Rectopexy Graft Biodesign Rectopexy Graft (Cook Biotech, West Lafayette, IN) is a porcine derived, non- cross linked, dried multi - layered small intestinal submucosa (SIS) sheet. Biodesign Rectopexy Graft is proposed to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists in the gastroenterological anatomy including transabdominal repair of colon and rectal prolapse. The product received FDA 510(K) approval on May 6, 2016 as Biodesign Sling, Biodesign Plastic Surgery Matrix, Biodesign Anal Fistula Plug (K161221). The three devices were bundled under the same 510(k) submission because the devices share many of the same technological characteristics: composed of porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS), packaged in a Tyvek/PE pouch, labeled with a shelf -life of 18 months, and sterilized using ethylene oxide. The only differences between the three devices are the indications (and associated labeling) and the dimensional specifications (specific to the indication and anatomic requirement for each device) (CMS, 2016). The Biodesign Sling FDA indication for use: for implantation to reinforce soft tissues where weakness exists in the urological, gynecological and gasteroenterological anatomy including but not limited to the following procedures: transvaginal repair of stress urinary incontinence, such as pubourethral support and bladder support, and transabdominal repair of apical vaginal prolapse, colon and rectal prolapse, and sacrocolposuspension. Per the manufacturer, the rectopexy graft and sling are the same product, just renamed. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed literature to support the safety and efficacy of Biodesign Rectopexy Graft.

Suture line buttressing and will be available to repair the carotid artery including patch closure following endarterectomy procedures\" (FDA, 2011). According to the manufacturer, Proxicor ( Aziyo Biologics, Silver Springs, MD) is the same product as CorMatrix Patch for Cardiac Tissue Repair. There is a paucity of evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of the CorMatrix products. Published studies are primarily in the form of case reports, case series and retrospective reviews with small, heterogeneous patient populations and short -term follow -ups. Outcomes have been conflicting regarding the clinical effectivenss and complications following implantation of Cormatrix. Page 62 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Mosala et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review to evaluate CorMatrix for cardiovascular surgeries. A total of 47 articles were included. Twenty studies were animal studies. Two human studies investigated CorMatrix for pericardial reconstruction and vascular repair at different sites. Eleven studies used CorMatrix at intracardiac sites for various indications. Several case reports for various conditions were also included. CorMatrix has been used in congenital cardiac and vascular surgery, pericardial reconstruction, valve reconstruction in adults and children, endocarditis, acquired vascular defects at different sites and for repair of damaged myocardium after infarction. Overall, patient populations have been small (n=2- 57) with short -term follow -ups. There are few reports of complications when used in the low pressure conditions, usually extracardiac environment (i.e. veins). However when used at higher pressure intracardiac sites such as the aortic valve or in semilunar valves, more complications have been reported. Data also suggested that CorMatrix may cause significant inflammatory reactions. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, retrospective study designs and lack of a comparator t he safety and effectiveness of CorMatrix has not been established. Corplex Corplex P (StimLabs LLC, Roswell, GA) is a Wharton's jelly allograft obtained from a single donated human umbilical cord, dehydrated into small pieces, and presented in a graft form.

The DuraGen Plus\u00ae Dural Regeneration Regeneration Matrix are FDA 510(k) approved mater\" ( Integra LifeSciences 2021; FDA, 2010). There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of Duragen implants. Studies are primarily in t he form of case reports and retrospective reviews. Williams et al. (2013) conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=34) to compare the efficacy of DuraGen (n=16), a sutureless device to Dura- Guard (n=18), a suturable device. The objective of the study w as to determine if suturing the dural patch was essential for reduction of complications or whether sutureless patches correlated to worse outcomes. The authors also completed a cost analysis. Subjects were age 18 years and older with a clinical diagnosis of Chiari Malformation I (CM I). Follow -up occurred for three months. Postoperatively, there were no significant differences in complications, pseudomeningocele, meningitis, CSF leak, readmissions or emergency room visits and no patients had a wound infect ion. SF -36 Quality of Life Questionnaire scores showed no significant differences in patient's physical health (p<0.005) and function (p<0.005) were significantly improved. All patients showed a significant improvement in their outcome response (p=0.0112). Limitations of the study include the small patient population and short -term follow -up. Dura -Guard \u00ae Dura -Guard (Synovis\u00ae Surgical Innovations, St. prepared from a bovine pericardium cross -linked with glutaraldehyde. It is a membranous implant sutured to the surrounding dura. The device is FDA 510 (k) approved for closure of dura mater during neurosurgical procedures. The product is available in five different sizes (FDA, 1998). There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficac y of Dura -Guard. As noted above in DuraGen, Williams et al.

DuraMatrix DuraMatrix Collagen Dura Substitute Membranes and DuraMatrix -Onlay (Collagen Matrix, Inc., Franklin Lakes, NJ) are resorbable matrices made from collagen derived from bovine Achilles tendon. The devices are FDA 510(k) approved for \"use as a dural substitute for the repair of dura mater\" (FDA, 2006). The membrane can be applied either as an inlay or sutured in place. Due to the lack of evidence in published clinical trials, the safety and efficacy of DuraMatrix implants have not been established. DuraSeal \u00ae Dural , Princeton, NJ consists of synthetic absorbable sealant materials and an applicator used to apply the sealant to an incision site. The sealant is approved by the Page 66 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 FDA premarket approval (PMA) process \"for use as an adjunct to sutured dural repair during cra nial surgery to provide watertight closure. DuraSeal should only be used with autologous duraplasty.\" The sealant is composed of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) ester solution and a trilysine amine solution that are mixed together to form a gel. The gel is applied to the suture site to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage and is proposed to be absorbed in four to six weeks (FDA, 2009; FDA, 2005). Osbun et al. (2012) conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of DuraSeal Dural Sealant System (n=120) compared to a control group treated with standard procedure based on the surgeon's judgment (e.g., application of additional sutures; soft tissue patches from muscle, pericardium or fascia; vascularized grafts of muscle and pericranium; off -label use of various biological products including fibrin glues, gelatin and collagen sponges, dural substitutes, and/or hemostatic agents) (n=117). Patients underwent infratentorial or supratentorial procedures. There were significant dif ferences in sealing methods between the two approaches. Some patients in both groups required autologous duraplasty. There were no significant differences between the groups in neurosurgical complications, reoperation/unplanned interventions, surgical woun d complications, central nervous system events, cerebral spinal fluid leaks or surgical site infections within the first 30 postoperative days. The authors noted that a limitation of the study included a significantly greater number of infratentorial proce dures were performed in the control group (p=0.04). Other limitations include the use of two different surgical approaches and the short -term follow -up. Additional randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the safety and efficacy reported in this study. DuraSeal \u00ae Exact Spine Sealant System DuraSeal Spine Sealant System ( Integra Lifesciences, Princeton, NJ ) is FDA PMA approved \"for use as an adjunct to sutured dural repair during spinal surgery to provide watertight closure\" to prevent CSF leakage through the suture pinholes and gaps between stitches. The system is composed of two solutions, a PEG ester solution and a Trilysine amine solution. When mixed together, the precursors polymerize to form the hydrogel sealant. The sealant is sprayed or l ayered on the sutured site. Since the sealant is more than 90% water, it is absorbed within four to eight weeks following surgery. The hydrogel may swell up to 50% of its size in any dimension (FDA 2009). Kim and Wright (2011) conducted a multicenter, ran domized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of DuraSeal Spinal Sealant (n=102) compared to standard methods (n=56) (control group). Examples of control group procedures included sutures or sutures plus fibrin glue. Postoperative follow -ups occurred at 30 and 90 days. Nine patients required a second application of DuraSeal for continued leakage on Valsalva. In the control group, 20 patients had a nonwatertight closure and 16 received no further treatment per the surgeon's discretion. Patients treated with DuraSeal had a significantly higher rate of watertight closure compared to the control group (p<0.001). No statistically significant differences were reported in postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (CSF) (p=1.00), infection, and wound healing. No neurologic deficits were seen attributable to the sealant. Study limitations noted by the authors included the choice of the intraoperative watertight dural closure with Valsalva as the primary end point instead of postoperative CSF leak and in t he control group some investigators chose not to attempt second treatment method per protocol but instead used another adjunctive therapy. Other limitations of the study are the unequal number of patients in the groups and the short -term follow -up. Additional studies are needed to support the safety and efficacy of DuraSeal Spinal Philadelphia, PA) is a resorbable, colorless, monofilament knit surgical mesh made entirely polydioxanone (PDO) thread. Polydioxanone S urgical Scaffold is proposed for use in reinforcement of soft tissue where weakness exists. On August 1, 2018, 510(k) approval (K181094) was given to Polydioxanone Surgical Scaffold . It is manufactured in two rectangular shapes: 6x16 cm and 10x25 cm. Acco rding to the manufacturer's Instructions for Use, DuraSorb has not been studied for use in the repair of direct inguinal hernias, intraperitoneal use, contaminated and/or infected wounds or in breast reconstructive surgeries (Surgical Innovation Associates , 2021).

EpiBurn is processed from human tissue according to t he Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) standards, and is regulated as a human cell, tissue, or cellular or tissue -based product (HCT/P) under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. The M embrane is available in 6x6 cm, 9x7 cm and 7x15 cm sizes (LifeHealthcare, 2021 ). Evidence supporting the use of EpiBurn for any indication is lacking. EpiCord EpiCord (MiMedx Group, Kennesaw, GA) is a minimally manipulated, dehydrated, human umbilical co rd allograft for homologous use. It is comprised of the protective elements of the umbilical cord with a thin amnion layer and a thicker Wharton Jelly mucopolysaccharide component. It is proposed for the treatment and management of chronic and acute wounds, burns and as a natural biological barrier to protect tendons. EpiCord is processed from human tissue according to the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) standards, and is regulated as a human cell, tissue, or cellular or tissue-based product (H CT/P) under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. It is available in 2x3 cm and 3x5 cm sizes (Mimedex, 2021 ; CMS, 2016). Evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness for Epicord for all indications is lacking. Tettlebach et al. (2018) conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of EpiCord (n=101) compared to an alginate wound dressing (control group) (n=54) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Inclusion criteria were a confirmed diagnosis of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and a 1- 15 cm 2 ulcer located below the ankle for at least 30 days that had undergone debridement. The control group had an alginate dressing applied ( excluding silver and collagen), covered by a non- adherent silicone dressing and an absorbent hydropolymer secondary dressing. The 18 -week study period included a two- week run- in phase in which the DFU was treated with moist dressings and offloading. If the DFU did not reduce by at least 30% from Page 68 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 baseline, subjects were randomized 2:1 into the EpiCord or control group, respectively. The run- in period was followed by a 12- week treatment phase and final follow -up at week 16. EpiCord was applied weekly following debridement. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of subjects in the intention to treat (ITT) population with complete wound closure of the study ulcer within 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes included 12 -week healing rates in subjects who completed the study per protocol and wounds that wer e determined to have received consistent, adequate debridement. Complete healing was defined as 100% epithelialization of the wound. Data were analyzed in an intent -to-treat (ITT) population. Analysis was also conducted on subjects (n=134) who completed the study per protocol (PP) (EpiCord, n=86; alginate, n=40). 12- week outcomes included the following: ITT analysis showed that significantly more DFUs treated with EpiCord (71/101 ; 70%) healed treated with alginate dressings (26/54; 48%) (p=0.0089). Healing rates at 12 weeks for subjects treated PP showed significantly better healing rates with EpiCord subjects who received adequate debridement (64/67; 96%) completely healed compared to the control group (26/40; 65%) (p<0.001). In the ITT population, DFUs that received adequate debridement healed completely with EpiCord (64/67; 96%) compared with the control group (26/40; 65%) (p<0.0001). At the 16 -week follow -up significantly more ulcers treated with EpiCord were healed compared with control group in the ITT population (p=0.0199). For subjects completing the study per protocol more EpiCord- treated ulcers (73/86; 85%) were healed compared to the control group (29/48; 60%). The median number of EpiCord allografts applied per healed wound was seven (range 2 -12). There were no reported adverse events related to EpiCord or alginate dressings. Limitations of the study include the small patient population, short -term follow -up and 2:1 randomization. The authors noted that this is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the safety and efficacy of an allograf t derived from umbilical cord as a treatment for chronic DFUs. Additional studies are indicated to support the clinical effectivenss of EpiCord.

GORE \u00ae BIO-A\u00ae Fistula Plug The GORE BIO Gore Medical , Flagstaff, AZ ) is approved as a Class II, 510(k) synthetic bioabsorbable scaffold intended for use in the reinforcement of soft tissue for repair of anorectal fistulas. It is a surgical mesh supplied in a preformed three -dimensional shape (disk with attached tubes) and comprised of a porous structure of synthetic bioabsorbable PGAP:TMC copolymier fiber, degraded via a combination of hydrolytic and enzymatic pathways. Cell migration into the scaffold and tissue is generated as the body gradually absorbs the synthetic material (FDA, 2009). There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature to support the safety and efficacy of this device. Studies are primarily in the form of case reports , retrospective reviews and case series with small patient populations and short -term follow -up. Narang et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GoreBio- A synthetic plug for the treatment of anal fistula. Six studies ( n=221) met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis, data extraction (n=187) and data synthesis. Studies of adult patients undergoing treatment for simple or complex fistulas with the Gore fistula plug regardless of etiology or pathological anatomy were included. Most fistulas were cryptoglandular and others were due to surgical trauma, Crohn's disease or HIV infection. Three studies were prospective in design and three were retrospective. No randomized controlled trials were found. Subject ages ranged from 19 -82 years. Follow -ups ranged from 2 -19 months. Thirteen patients (5.9%) were lost to follow -up and 21 (9.5%) underwent alternative treatment. Fistula healing rates ranged from 15.8% -72.7%. Early or delayed plug extrusion occurred in 16/187 patients (8.5%). Limitations of the studies included: small patient population, lack of randomized or comparative study design, and heterogeneity of etiologies and follow -up protocols. Due to the low quality of evidence, conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the Gore Bio- A fistula plug and improved clinical outcomes could not be made. GORE \u00ae BIO-A\u00ae Tissue Reinforcement GORE BIO -A Tissue Reinforcement ( Gore Medical , Flagstaff, ene carbonate [PGA:TMC]) , gradually absorbed by the body and proposed for soft tissue reinforcement. The product is FDA 510(k), Class II, approved for use in the reinforcement of soft tissue including hernia repair, muscle flap reinforcement, perforated ti ssue repair and general tissue reconstruction. Six sizes are available ( 7x10 cm, 8x8 cm, 9x15 cm, 10x30 cm, 20x20 c m, 20x30 cm) (Gore Medical, 2022; FDA, 2012). The safety and efficacy of this product has not been established. Studies are primarily in the form of retrospective reviews, case reports and case series with small patient populations and short -term follow -up (Smith and Slater, 2021) . Rosen et al. (2017) conducted a multicenter prospective observational study (n=104) to evaluate the use and performance of Gore Bio -A Tissue Reinforcement. Adult patients with incisional hernias of 9 cm2, undergoing a planned single- staged repair of a ventral/incisional hernia with an operation classified by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) wound criteria as a clean -contaminated or contaminated wound were eligible for study enrollment. The CDC wound classification showed 77% of wounds were contaminated a nd 23% were clean- contaminated. Patients were enrolled if a single unit of the Mesh could adequately reinforce the midline fascial closure with at least four centimeters of lateral overlap. The biosynthetic mesh was placed as a sublay in either the intrape ritoneal or retrorectus position, based on the discretion of the surgeon, to reinforce midline fascial closure. The primary outcome measure was the rate of hernia recurrence based on physical examination at the two- year follow -up. Hernia recurrence was def ined as a new hernia within seven centimeters of the repair, and categorized as midline, at the stoma site, or both. Secondary outcomes included incidence of wound events and quality -of-life assessments. Recurrent herniation occurred in 16 patients (17%) at the 2- year follow -up. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with mesh placement in the intraperitoneal position (40%; Page 72 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 4/10) versus placement in the retrorectus position (13%; 12/94) (p=0.0451). Time to recurrence was shorter in patient s with postoperative infection (p=0.0098) than those without and those with parastomal compared with midline hernia recurrences (p<0.0001). Overall patients reported significant sustained improvement in physical health of the two- year follow -up period (p<0.05). There were nine superficial surgical site infections that resolved with oral or intravenous antibiotics. Of the ten deep surgical site infections, six required percutaneous drainage alone, three underwent minor operative debridement and one underwent wide wound debridement with partial mesh excision. Additional wound events included development of a postoperative seroma (n=6). Three required percutaneous drainage and eventually resolved. Two postoperative bowel obstructions occurred in patients with mesh placed in the retrorectus position. Author -noted limitations of the study included: the selected study format of a longitudinal observational study potentially limited the ability to apply the results; lack of a control group and randomization; short -term follow -up; diversity of hernia sizes; heterogeneity of the patient population and surgical procedures performed; inherent limitations of outcomes research ed (e.g., quality -of-life indices) in patients with complex ventral hernia repair; lack of post -operative computerized tomogram; and lack of generalizability. Additional studies are needed to establish the clinical effec tiveness and safety of Gore Bio -A Tissue Reinforcement. GraftJacket\u00ae Xpress GraftJacket Xpress (Wright Medical a flowable soft -tissue scaffold, is a powdered form of the GraftJacket tissue matrix. Using saline, it is reconstituted and injected into a wound. The scaffold is proposed for filling deep tunneling- type chronic wounds such as those found in chronic diabetic foot ulcers. The skin substitute is packaged in a syringe and intended for one time use. This product is regulated by the FDA as human tissue for transplantation. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature to support the safety and efficacy of GraftJacket Xpress. Studies have primarily been in the form of retrospective reviews with small patient populations and short -term follow -ups (Brigido, et al., 2009). Helicoll HeliColl (EnColl Corporation, Fremont, A) is a semi -occlusive, self -adhering, acellular, Type- 1 collagen graft proposed for wound care. It is derived from a bovine or ovine source.

It is a semi -transparent, minimally manipulated, terminally sterilized membrane allograft. HHF10P is intended for homologous use to act as a covering or barrier to offer protection fr om the surrounding environment in clinical applications (Wolver and Poole Distribution, LLC, 2019) . HHF10P appears to meet the criteria for regulation solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act and the regulations in 21 CFR part 1271 as a Human Cell and Tissue Product (HCT/P) (CMS, 2021). HHF10P is supplied at either a 2 cm x 2 cm or 4 cm x 4 cm size in dual -layer, sterile 4 mm packaging (CMS, 2021). There is a lack of evidence in the published, peer -reviewed literature to support the safety and efficacy of Human Health Factor 10 Amniotic Patch (HHF10P) for any indication. Page 73 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Hyalomatrix PA\u00ae acellular skin substitute composed of hyaluronic acid and a semipermeable silicone membrane that acts as a scaffold for cellular invasion and capillary ingrow th. The matrix is FDA 510(k) approved \"for the management of wounds including: partial and full -thickness second -laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence); trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, skin tears); and draining wounds\" (FDA, 2007). There is insufficient evidence in the peer -reviewed scientific literatur e to support the safety and effectiveness of Hyalomatrix PA. Studies evaluating Hyalomatrix have primarily been in the form of case series and retrospective reviews with small patient populations and heterogeneous diagnosis. In general, randomized controlled trials have not supported the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid for the treatment of chronic ulcers (Shaharudin, et al., 2016). Observational case series using Hyalomatrix have been reported for the treatment of non- melanoma skin cancer (n=10) (Dessy, et al. 2016), upper and lower limb trauma (n=15) (Vaienti, et al., 2013), venous ulcers (n=16) (Motolese, et al., 2013), coverage of cancellous bone exposition in diabetic foot ulcers (n=23) (Caravaggi, et al., 2009), and pediatric burns (n=300) which was one centers experience in using Hyalomatrix PA as a bridge to remove necrotic debris and stimulate regeneration (Gravante, et al., 2007). Randomized controlled trials comparing Hyalomatrix PA to established standard of care for these conditions are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this product. Caravaggi et al. (2011) conducted an observational study (n=262) for the use of Hyalomatrix PA (HPA) for the treatment of multiple types of chronic wounds including vascular ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers , pressure ulcers, traumatic wounds and others (vasculitic ulcers and iatrogenic). Ninety -five of the ulcers had tendon, joint, or bone exposure. Patients had failed at least two months of conventional therapy. The main endpoint of this study was the reduc tion in threshold area ( 10%).At the baseline visit, HPA was applied along with a non- adherent dressing which were left undisturbed for at least one week. The nonadherent dressing was changed weekly or as needed. HYAFF (derivative of hyaluronic acid) was completely absorbed by the 15 th day. At that point, if a suitable dermal layer had been restored, a thin autograft was applied or for smaller wounds, healing was reached spontaneously. The \"wound edge effect\" was assessed by measuring advancement of the wound edge. A threshold area reduction of the ulcer (epithelial advancement) of 10% was an endpoint measure. Re - epitheliazation was achieved in 83% of ulcers in a median of 16 days. Twenty -six percent of wounds achieved 75% re- epitheliazation within the 60- day follow -up period with HPA only treatment. A follow -up showed that 84% of ulcers achieved complete re- epithelialization by secondary intention. Limitations of the study include lack of a comparator and randomization; and heterogeneity of type, size, lo cation, depth and duration of ulcers. Gravante et al. (2007) conducted a prospective case series (n=300) to assess the outcomes of a \"bridge\" treatment for deep -partial thickness burn patients. The treatment involved removing necrotic debris by dermabras ion followed by the application of Hyalomatrix PA on the third to fifth hospital day. Dressings were changed every seven days and areas without signs of recovery on day 21 were removed with escharectomy and covered with thin skin grafts. A total of 183 pat ients required only one treatment, 67 required more than one treatment and 50 patients required escharectomy. A total of 83% of patients healed within 21 days. A limitation of the study is the lack of a control or comparison group. Prospective randomized c ontrolled trials are needed to validate the outcomes of this study and evaluation of the recurrence rate. HydroFix \u00ae Vaso Shield HydroFix Vaso Shield (the \"Vaso Shield\") (MiMedx\u00ae Group, Inc., Marietta, GA) is a vessel guard made of hydrogel material using proprietary technology. Protection of veins and arteries is a common issue associated with many types of surgeries. Protection of the aorta, vena cava, iliac vessels and other anatomy is particularly important in anterior spine surgery. HydroFix \u00ae Vaso Shield was designed to help physicians protect vessels during anterior vertebral surgery. The Shield is FDA 510(k) approved \"as a cover for vessels during anterior vertebral surgery\". Intended uses include: fusion surgery, adjacent level surgery, art ificial disc implantation, implant or hardware removal, trauma, and vascular surgery in the spine (FDA, 2011). Data in the form of clinical trials supporting the safety and effectiveness of HydroFix are lacking. Page 74 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 InnovaMatrix\u00ae AC and InnovaMatrix\u00ae FS InnovaMatrix\u00ae AC and InnovaMatrix\u00ae FS (Triad Life Sciences, Memphis, TN) are sterile, single use, decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) topical wound coverings derived from porcine placental material. They are proposed for use in the management of wounds, including: partial - and full thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor site/grafts, post -Mohs surgery, post -laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds, (abrasions, lacerations, second -degree burns and skin tears), and draining wounds. InnovaMatrix received FDA 510(k) (K1935520) approval in 2020 (FDA, 2022). InnovaMatrix AC is available in the following sizes: 15 mm disc, 2x2cm, 4x4cm, 4x6cm, a nd 5x5cm (Triad Life Sciences, 2023). InnovaMatrix FS is produced in fenestrated sheets in a variety of sizes (CMS, 2021). Evidence is lacking in the published peer -reviewed literature to support the clinical effectiveness of InnovaMatrix AC or InnovaMatrix FS for any indication. Integra Flowable Matrix Integra Flowable Wound Matrix (Integra Plainsboro, NJ) is a granulated, acellular bovine tendon collagen and glycosaminoglycan device that is 510(k) FDA (K072113) approved for the treatment of advanced wound care. The granulates are reconstituted with sali ne to form a gel -like substance. The Matrix is considered \"substantially equivalent in function and intended use to Integra Matrix Wound Dressing\" and is approved for the treatment of \"partial and full -thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor sites/grafts, post -Mohs surgery, post-laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second- degree burns, skin tears) and draining wounds\" (Integra LifeSciences, 2021; FDA, 2007). The skin substitute is packaged in a syringe and intended for one time use. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed scientific literature supporting the efficacy of Integra Flowable Wound Matrix. Campitiello et al. (2017) conducted a randomized, placebo- controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of Integra Flowable Wound Matrix (n=23) compared with a wet dressing (n=23) for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) with irregular geometries (tunneling or cavity lesions). Inclusion criteria were diabetic patients, age > 18 years, who had Grade 3 Wagner classification DFUs with an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.5. Antibiotic therapy was started 7-10 days prior to surgery and continued until the wound had healed. The primary objective of the study was to determine the percentage of patients with wound closure (100% re- epithelialization). Secondary outcome measures included the time to healing and safety (number of major amputations and hospitalizations). Wounds were cleaned and necrotic tissue was removed until normal healthy tissues appeared. After mixing the dry granular collagen with saline solution, the matrix was applied to the lesion, until completely filled. The edge of the wound was sutured. Wounds in the control group were covered with a sterile saline - moistened gauze before the dressing was applied. Compression dressings and offloading devices were used by both groups. Patients were followed until complete wound healing had occurred or for up to six weeks. Healing was determined by clinical examination and complete healing was defined as 100% re- epithelialization in the absence of discharge. At six weeks, complete healing had occurred in significantly more Integra patients (n=20; 86.95%) than control group patients (n=12; 52.17%) (p=0.001). Healing time was significantly shorter in the study group, where the surgical breach was closed by primary intention compared to the control group, where the surgical breach healed by secondary intention. The biomaterial allowed closure of wound by primary intention, reducing the healing time. Minor amputations were performed in nine study group subjects and eight control group subjects. Major amputations (p=0.0019) and re -hospitalization rates (p=0.028) were significantly less in the Integra group. Limitations of the study include the small patient population and short -term follow -up. The authors concluded that addi tional studies are needed with large patient populations and long- term follow -up to validate these findings. Integra \u00ae Reinforcement Matrix Integra Reinforcement Matrix NJ) is an acellular porcine dermal matrix proposed for use in the reconstruction of soft tissue deficiencies. Per Lifesciences, the matrix is \"intended for implantation to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists and for surgical repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue, including reinforcement of the rotator cuff, patellar, Achilles, biceps, quadriceps, or other tendons. Integra Reinforcement Matrix is not intended to replace normal body structure or provide the full mechanical strength. Sutures used to repair the tear and sutures or bone anchors used to attach the tissue to the bone provide biomechanical strength for the tendon repair\". The Integra Reinforcement Matrix is available in 4x7 cm and 5x10 Page 75 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 cm (Integra Lifesciences, 2020). There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed literature to support the safety and effectiveness of this matrix. InteguPly (Tran Zgraft) Integuply, previously known as TranZgraft, (AZIYO\u00ae Springs, MD) is a dual -sided, human acellular collagen matrix proposed for the treatment of sports related injuries, including tendons and ligaments. The epidermis and all viable cellular components are removed from the collagen matrix during processing. The dermal side is proposed to host tissue vascularization and cellular incorporation. The tissue preparation is compliant with the FDA, AATB and state regulatory requirem ents (OsseoDent, 2023). There is insufficient evidence published in the peer -reviewed literature to support the safety and effectivene ss of TranZgraft. Interfyl Interfyl Human Connective Tissue Inc. , Warren, NJ) is an allogeneic, decellularized, particulate human tissue derived from the placenta. Because it is not cross- linked and does not contain cells, Interfyl is proposed to reduce the likelihood of immunogenic and inflammatory responses. It is proposed as a supplement or replacement for damaged or inadequate integumental. Interfyl is recommended for the treatment of deep dermal wounds, irregularly -shaped and tunneling wounds, augmentation of deficient/inadequate soft tissue, and the repair of small surgical defects. It is available in 1.5 ml flowable form in 3 cc syringe and in 50 mg and 100 mg particulate in vials ( Celularity , 2021; CMS , 2016). There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of Interfyl for any indication. Karamatrix \u00ae, Kerasorb Keramatrix (Keraplast Technologies, Antonio, TX) is an absorbable matrix, rich in keratin protein, proposed to deliver Replicine Functional Keratin\u00ae into the wound as the Matrix dissolves. The keratin protein is derived from sheep's wool.

Keramatrix is supplied in 2x2 cm and 4x4 sizes (WoundSource , 2023; CMS, 2015). The FDA approval different wound dressings. Keratec Keragel, Kerafoam and Keraderm. These products are indicated for \"dry, light and moderately exudating partial and full thickness wounds such as: first and second degree bums; severe sunburns; and superficial injuries, cuts, abrasions and surgical wounds\". The Keratec Wound dressing may also be used in the management of dry, light and moderately exudating partial and full thickness wounds including pressure (stage I -IV) and venous stasis ulcers; ulcers caused by mixed vascular diabetic and donor sites and grafts. The Keratec Wound Dressings are not intended to be used on third degree burns (FDA, 2009) . Kerasorb \u00ae is a multilayer dressing with a keratin wound contact surface backed with an absorbent polyurethane foam and two gel dressings (keragel\u00ae, keragelT\u00ae) (Keraplast,, 2016; FDA, 2009). Kerasorb Wound Matrix is proposed for the treatment of chronic wounds including: pressure ulcers (stages I -IV), venous stasis ulcers, ulcers caused by mixed vascular etiologies, diabetic ulcers, and donor sites an d grafts. It is supplied in single use pouches containing one, 1 0x10 cm foam wound matrix (CMS, 2019). There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of Keramatrix and Karetec keratin products for any indications. Studies are primarily in the form of case reports and case series with small patient populations, heterogeneity of the types of wounds treated and heterogeneity of the type of keratin products used (Batzer, et al., 2016; Loan, et al., 2016; Hammond, et al., 2010). Davidson et al. (2016) conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=26) to compare wound healing using a standard of care (SOC) dressing vs. Keramatrix for the treatment of partial -thickness donor site wounds. Part of their own donor site was used as the control for each patient. The proximal or distal location of each dressing type was randomized. The middle third of the wound was ignored as it potentially may have been influenced by both dressings. A calcium alginated dressing was used as the control dressing. For analysis, 15 patients were placed into the old group (age >50 years) and 11 patients were placed in the young group (age 50 years). The median epithelialization at 7 days was 80% for the young group and there was no significant difference between the treatment and control portions of the wounds. In the older group, the majority of each wound was unhealed at day seven. There was a significant difference (p=0.23) between epithelialization in the control vs. the treatment Page 76 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 portion of the wound in favor of the treated portion. Limitations of the study include the small patient population and short -term follow -up. The authors noted that a weakness of the assessment technique was that it was difficult to repeat the results of digital images which were unable to capture the detail necessary to make the assessments of percentage epithelialization.

There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed literature to support the clinical utility of MariGen/Kerecis Omega3 Wound product. Studies are primarily in t he form of small randomized control trials, case series, retrospective reviews and case reports with small patient populations (n=5- 85) with short -term follow -up (28 days to 12 weeks) (Kim, et al., 2021; Lullove, et al., 2021; Badois, et al., et al., et al., 2019; Woodrow, et al., 2019; Dorweiler, et al., 2018; Yang, et al., 2016; Baldursson, et al., 2015; FDA. 2013). Lullove et al (2021) conducted a randomized control trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Kerecis Omega3 in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Included in the study (n=49) were adults 18 years or older with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) for a minimum of four weeks who demonstrated adequate renal function and perfusion to affected extremity. The DFU could be through the dermis but not into tendon, muscle, or bone with the index ulcer size of 1cm\u00b2 and 25cm\u00b2. Patients were excluded if they were being treated with systemic antibiotics at time of randomization; had an ulcer on heel; were on any investigational drug or therapeutic device within 30 days preceding study visit; had received a biomedical or topical growth factor for wound within the previous 30 days; were pregnant or breastfeeding; had a HbAic >12.0; or end -stage renal disease as evidenced by a serum creatinine 3.0 mg/dL within the previous six months. No significant difference was noted between the study groups in terms of demographics, renal function, or blood glucose. All patients were first treated with standard of Page 77 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 care (SOC) (offloading, appr opriate debridement, and moist wound care) for a 2 -week screening period then randomized to SOC plus fish skin graft (n=25) applied weekly for up to 12 weeks or SOC using collagen alginate dressing (n=24) applied weekly by investigator and three times week ly by patient/caregiver. Primary outcome was the percentage of wounds closed at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included time to heal (for DFUs that healed) and wound area reduction by percentage at 12 weeks. Percentage of wounds healed at 12 weeks wa s 67% (16/24) for fish skin group and 32% (8/25) in SOC group. Time to closure was six weeks for both groups. Percentage of area reduction at six weeks was 72.8% for fish skin and 41.2% for SOC. Percentage of area reduction at 12 weeks was 97.3% fish skin and 76.8% SOC. Adverse events included mild erythema and irritation which was experienced by both groups. Study limitations included small patient population. Keroxx Flowable Matrix Keroxx Flowable Matrix (Molecular Biologicals, LLC., Houston TX) is a bovine wound matrix comprised of keratin enriched proteins containing the active ingredient Replicine Functional Keratins which are biologically active proteins. The proteins are extracted using proprietary processes from sheep wool . The Matrix is mixed with sterile sali ne to form a gel -like consistency that is injected into the deepest part of the wound. According to the manufacturer, when Keroxx is injected onto the wound bed, the Replicine Functional Keratins are absorbed into the tissues in the wound and provide a biocompatible matrix or scaffold for cellular proliferation, migration and capillary growth to aid in the growth of new tissue. Keroxx flowable is proposed for the treatment of partial and full thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds, (donor sites/grafts, post -Mohs surgery, post laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lac erations, second- degree burns, skin tears) and draining wounds. Keroxx flowable is available in a single use kit containing one, 3 cc syringe with Keroxx 2023; CMS , 2018).

The MatriStem MicroMatrix\u00ae consists of micronized particles that are sprinkled onto the wound and covered with a moist dressing. MatriStem Wound Matrix and Multilayer Wound Matrix are also marketed as Cytal Wound Matrix 1 -Layer and 2 -Layer (A cell, 2023). In 2017 Ac ell announced that all products previously markete d under Matristem were being rebranded to Gentrix Surgical Matrix for soft tissue repair to differentiate A cell's surgical products from their wound management products Cytal and MicroMatrix (Acell, 2023 ). Matristem has been proposed for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, pilonidal wounds, anal fistulas, burns, status and decubitus ulers . Studies investigating Matristem for these conditions are primarily in the form of retrospecitive review with small patient populations (Geiger, et al., 2016; Kraemer, et al., 2016). There is insufficient evidence to support Matristem for these conditions . Frykberg et al. (2016) conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial (n=56) to compare the treatment DFUs with MicroMatrix to ulcers treated with Dermagraft (DG) (n=29) (living skin substitute). Prior to study initiation, patients participated in a four -week screening phase during which they received physician -selected standard of care (e.g., debridement, saline irrigation, primary dressing, offloading boot). Following the screening phase, patients with DFUs that decreased in size by 30% or increased by 50% and met other inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. Other inclusion criteria included: ulcer present for 4 weeks and extended through the dermis and into the subcutaneous tissue without muscle, tendon, bone or joint capsule exposure; HbA1c <12%; wound free of necrotic debris following debridement and appeared to have healthy vascularized tissues; and Doppler measured ankle -bronchial index (ABI) of 0.7 after 10 minutes rest. Once granulation began to occur on the wound bed, only MSWM was applied. The matrix was applied weekly until wound closure (complete re-epithelialization with no drainage, no dressing required) or until the patient had received one application per week without wound closure, whichever came first, up to a maximum of eight applications. Following complete wound closure, patients returned for a six -month follow -up visit to assess for ulcer recurrence. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the following: complete wound closure at day 56 (p=0.244), change in wound size over eight week treatment period (p=0.762); complete wound closure at day 70 (p=0.768); or mean time to closure (p=0.523). At the end of treatment the MS group reported statistically significant improvement in quality of life compared to the DG group (p=0.004 to 0.049). There was no statistically significant difference in wound recurrence at the six month follow -up (n=10). One MS -treated patient and two DG treated patients had ulcer recurrence. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups. Limitations of the study include the small patient population and the manual nature of the data collection tracing the wounds to a Visitrak system. Matrix HD Matrix HD (RTI Biologics, Inc., an acellular allograft human dermis is proposed to support cellular revascularization and repopulation by the host tissue. Regulated by the American Association of Tissue Banks and the FDA guidelines for banked human tissue, the matrix has been used in the repair of the deltoid muscle, patellar tendon, Achilles tendon, and shoulder capsule, as well as elbow capsule recons truction, and fascia repair in the calf.

The dressin g comes in fenestrated and non-fenestrated patches ranging in size from 3x3 cm to 8x 15 cm ( Reprise Biomedical, 2023; CMS , 2016). There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of this porcine liver matrix for any indication. MiroFlex \u00ae (formerly Miromesh\u00ae) MiroFlex (formerly known as Miromesh\u00ae) Plymouth, MN; Miromatrix Medical, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN) is a non -crosslinked , acellular surgical mesh derived from whole, compressed porcine livers for the reinforcement of soft tissue. Proposed indications include hernia repairs, and reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive surgery. MiroFlex uses a perfusion decellularization as opposed to an immersion decellularization technology to remove cells from the mesh. Miromesh sales and manufacturing will be managed by Reprise Biomedical ( Reprise Biomedical, 2023; FDA, 2014 ). The mesh is available in various sizes. Studies investigating the safety and effectiveness of Miromesh include a retrospective review for patients who underwent hernia repair (Gillian and Bansal) and a case series for repair of esophageal hernia (Rosen, et al., 2019) Page 80 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Rosen et al. (2019) conducted a multicenter pr ospective single arm study (n=41) evaluating the outcomes of MiroMesh when used for repair of a symptomatic paresophageal hernia. Inclusion criteria were: adults age elective hiat al hernia dimension; evidence of Type II or III paraesophageal hernia; and committment to not smoking for at least four weeks prior to procedure. Subjects were excluded if they had undergone prior esophageal or gastric surgery; had a sens itivity to porcine material; were immunocompromised (i.e., HIV, post-organ transplant, on chemotherapy); required emergent surgery for acute gastric volvulous or strangulation; had a BMI 40; life expectancy < 2 years; and/or had an associated GI disease that required extensive medical or surgical intervention (e.g., Crohn's Disease) that might interfere with quality of life assessment. The primary endpoint of the study was hernia recurrence that required surgical re- intervention at two years postoperat e due to symptoms or adverse events. The secondary endpoints included: radiologic recurrence, symptomatic improvement, quality of life, adverse events and perioperative outcomes. All patients underwent a laparoscopic transabdominal approach with no conversions to an open procedure. Twenty -seven patients completed the two- year follow -up. Radiologic evaluation demonstrated hiatal hernia recurrences in three patients who did not require surgical reintervention. GERD HRQL scores were significantly improved from baseline to two y ears follow up (19.3 to 3.8) (p<0.0001). At the two-year follow -up 89% of patients reported satisfaction with their condition vs. 17.9% preoperatively. Results of the SF -36 questionnaire showed that quality of life was significantly improved at all time points with overall quality of life improvement seen at 24 months compared to baseline. There were no major intraoperative complications reported. Eighteen postoperative adverse events included four serious events that were not related to the mesh. Limitations of the study include the lack of a comparator, small patient population, number of patients lost to follow -up and the short -term follow -up.

Supple Peri -Guard Patch is a similar product proposed for procedures that require a more flexible and compliant patch (FDA, 2012) . There is insufficient evidence in the peer -reviewed literature to support Peri -Guard Repair Patch for any indication. Studies evaluating the Patch include case reports, case series and retrospective reviews with small patient populations (n=5- 92). Reported uses of the Patch included post -mastec tomy breast reconstruction, chest wall reconstruction (e.g., due to secondary incisional herniation development following lung transplantation or malignant disease with chest wall infiltration) and diaphragmatic repair. Peri-Strips Dry Peri-Strips Dry (Synovis \u00ae Surgical Innovations, St. Paul, MN) is a proposed staple line reinforcement used with a surgical stapler. The device is composed of two primary components: the Peri -Strips Dry plastic mounting unit and the PSD Gel. The mounting unit has two strip of dehydrated bovine pericardium on each side of a foam spacer by the plastic mounting unit. The PSD adhesive hydrogel is placed on the strips to create a temporary bond between the strips and the surfaces of a surgical stapler and also pr omotes rehydration of the strips. The stapler is positioned on the tissue to be excised, fired and removed. There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of Per i-Strips Dry. Stamou et al. (2011) conducted a prospective comparative study (n=187) to determine if staple -line reinforcement with Peri -Strips Dry (PSD) reduces surgical complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Group A (n=96) received PSD and group B (n=91) did not receive PSD. Reinforcement with PSD significantly reduced the occurrence of bleeding from the staple line (p=0.012) and intra -abdominal collections (p=0.026). The leak rate was not significantly different between the two groups. Patients in group A required fewer days of hospitalization than group B (481 days vs. 524 days). Two leaks were observed in group A, one due to malfunction of the stapling device. In group B, three patients required transfusion. Number of stapler loads was 5-8 per operation. Limitations of the study include the small patient population, lack of randomization, and allocation primarily determined by insurance coverage and product availability. Angrisani et al. (2004) conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare extraluminal bleeding with (group A) (n=50) or without (group B) ( n=48) staple- Peri gastric patients. Outcome included: mortality, intraoperative and postoperative complications, operating time, number of hemostatic clips u sed, and blood transfusion. There were no recorded incidents of intra- or postoperative mortality and no patients were re- operated or transfused because of extraluminal bleeding. Intra- operative methylene blue test was positive in six group B patients compared to zero group A patients (p<0.001). The mean number of clips (p<0.001) and operating time (p<0.01) were significantly lower in group A. Conversion to laparotomy was required in one group A patient and two group B patients. No adverse clinical or surgi cal event was related to Peri -Strip. A limitation of the study is the small patient population and lack of reporting of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Miller et al. (2001) conducted a two- center, randomized controlled trial (n=80) to determine if Peri -Strip used as a buttress along the lung staple line would decrease air leaks and hospital stays after lobectomy and segmentectomy. Patients were no Peri -Strip (n=40). There were n o statistical Page 87 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 differences in the mean int ensive care unit length of stay ( p=0.09 ), number of days with a chest tube (p=0.6), or total length of stay (p=0.24). Patients treated with Peri -Strip had a 2 day mean duration of air leak and 5.9 day mean time to chest tube removal compared to three days and 6.3 days, respectively, for patient s without Peri - Strip. Stammberger et al. (2000) conducted a three -center randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of Peri - Strips Dry (PSD) (n=32) vs. no PSD (control group) (n=33) to reduce air leaks and shorten hospital length of stay on patients who underwent bilateral lung volume reduction surgery by video -assisted thoracoscopy using endoscopic staplers for severe emphysema. Number of cartridges used in the treatment group ranged from 8- 24 and 10 -26 in the control group. The median duration of air leaks (p<0.001) and the median drainage time (p<0.045) was significantly shorter in the PSD group. Four patients in the non- PSD group and three PSD patients required reoperation for persistent air leak and pneumothorax. There was no significant difference between the groups in the length of hospital stay. In three patients, PSD detached from the stapler before it was fired. Limitations of the study include the small patient population, short -term follow -up and heterogeneous emphysema morphology.

In 2004, 510(k) FDA approval was given for Permacol\u00ae Surgical Implant \"for use as a soft tissue patch to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists and for the repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue membranes. It is specifically indicated for the repair of abdominal wall def ects and hernias, including but not limited to parastomal hernias. The Permacol\u00ae Surgical Implant T -piece is shaped for use in rectal intussusception repair and the Permacol\u00ae Surgical Implant Rectocele- pieces are shaped for use in rectocele repair (FDA, 2005). Other Permacol products include ENDURAGen (distributed by Porex Corporation, Newnan, GA) specifically indicated for plastic and reconstructive surgery of the head and face, and Permacol Biologic Implant (distributed by Covidien, Mansfield, MA), a bi ologic mesh for hernia repair. The Permacol Injection agent is also available from Covidien. The application of Permacol products has been investigated for multiple conditions including: various types of hernia repairs, rectocele orbital floor implants; as a substitute for tendon graft to repair rotator various urological, et 2012; Bachman and Ramshaw, 2008; Hammond, et al., 2008; Hsu, et al., 2008; Papadogeorgakis, et al., 2008; Teicher, et al., 2008; Hammond, et 2008, Papadogeorgakis, et al., 2008; Shaikh, et al., 2007). Case series, cas e reports and retrospective reviews with small patient populations (n=15 - 86) and short -term follow -ups lack the data needed to support the efficacy of Permacol in the treatment of these conditions. Gossetti et al. (2021) conducted a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the biologic surgical implant, P ermacol, in the surgical treatment of complex abdominal wall reconstruction (CAWR) in adult patients (n=114) through 36 months postoperatively. Patients had a mean age of 60.8 \u00b1 12.2 (29 -87) years, 58.8% male, with a mean BMI of 31.2 \u00b1 6.0 (18.7- 45.4) kg/m 2. At 24 months, the cumulative hernia recurrence rate was 18.7% (17/91) and 22.4% (19/85) at 36 months. Reoperation for hernia repair within 36 months occurred in 12 (14.1%) patients. Patients reported improvement in the Carolina comfort scale (CSS) measures of severity of pain, sensation of mesh, and movement limitations between 6- and 36- months post - surgery. Adverse events included 13 (11.3%) dehiscences, 11 (9.6%) wound infections, 11 (9.6%) seromas, four (3.5%) hematomas and one stoma site pain. Study limitations include small patient population, short term follow up, and lack of a comparator. Page 88 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Maeda et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review investigating perianal injectable bulking agents for the treatment of fecal incontinence. Two randomized controlled trials using Permacol injection agent with a total of 12 patients were identified. There is insufficient data to support Permacol for the treatment of fecal incontinence. Bano et al. (2005) conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the use of Permacol injection (n=25) to silicone injection (Macroplastique) (n=25) in the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence in women. Following injection, two women treated with Permacol had urinary retention requiring catheterization for one week compared to three women in the Macroplastique injection group requiring catheterization for 24 hour to three days. Regarding pad loss at six months, 15 Permacol patients remained dry (62.5%), seven were unchanged, one was worse and one relapsed. In the Macroplastique group, nine were dry, seven were unchanged, five were worse and two relapsed. Fourteen Permacol patients had a reduction in the Stamey scoring system and 14 in the King's College Hospital Quality of Health Questionnaire scores compared to ten and seven, respectively, in the Macroplastique.

RECELL \u00ae Autologous Cell Harvesting Device The RECELL\u00ae Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (Avita Medical, Valencia, CA) is a sterile, single use, stand- alone, battery powered cell separation device operated by an appropriately -licensed healthcare professional at the patient's point of care to prepare autologous Regenerative Epidermal Suspension (RES\u00ae) for direct application to acute partial -thickness thermal burn wounds in patients 18 years of age and older or application in combination with meshed autografting for acute full -thickness thermal burn wounds in pediatric and adult patients. The device enables the processing of a small, thin split -thickness skin sample 0.006- 0.008 inch (0.15- 0.20 mm) in depth to prepare a cell population in suspension for immediate delivery onto a prepared wound surface. The user can enzymatically and mechanically process a small skin sample to produce RES. Processing tools provided with the device include off -the-shelf syri nges, scalpels, and fill needles. The device also includes nozzles that attach to syringes and can be used to aerosolize the cell suspension onto the wound. The proprietary RECELL Enzyme is reconstituted with sterile water (included) and used to facilitate disaggregation of cells from the harvested donor skin. A buffer solution is also provided to suspend the disaggregated cells for delivery to the prepared wound site. No cell culturing processes are involved in the procedure. The resulting suspension of cells comprises a mixed population predominantly of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The presence of viable melanocytes has also been demonstrated. The RECELL Autologous Cell Harvesting Device received FDA Premarket Approval (PMA) on 09/20/2018 for treatment of acute thermal burns in adults and the indication Page 93 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 was expanded in 2021 for use in combination with meshed autografting for acute full - thickness thermal burn wounds in pediatric and adult patients (PMA Number: BP170122) (FDA, 2022). There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed literature to support the safety and efficacy of the RECELL Autologous Cell Harvesting Device for the treatment of burns. Studies have primarily been in the form of case reports and one small randomized control trial (Holmes, et al., 2019) Bairagi et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis of randomized control trials to evaluate the efficacy of autologous skin cell suspensions (ASCS) on the re -epithelialization of partial thickness burn injuries a nd skin graft donor site wounds (DSW). Five studies (n=347) were located: two studies on adults (n=183) and one study on children with burn wounds (n=13), and two studies on adults with donor site wounds (n=151). Studies were included if they were on humans with partial thickness burn injuries and split -thickness skin graft donor site wounds. The intervention was autologous skin cell suspension prepared with the RECELL autologous cell harvesting device. The non- cultured mixture of epithelial cells was used in suspension format as a spray or droplet application in the wound management for treatment of burn wounds or split -thickness skin graft donor sites. Comparators included standard of care dressings/treatment with or without a skin graft. Primary outcome m easured was wound time to re -epithelialization (TTRE). Secondary outcomes measured included pain, scar sensitivity (itch, tightness), scar characteristics (pigmentation, thickness), scar specific health related quality of life, infection and need for addit ional surgery. Length of follow up ranged from 12- 52 weeks. Two studies reported on the use of ACSC in adult burn wound re -epithelialization compared to control group and had different methods of reporting the results. One study reported ASC had a reduced percentage of re- epithelialization (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.27, [95% CI: 0.50, [95% CI: 0.06, BW, compared to control group. In adults DSW, ASCS significantly reduced time to re- epithelialization compared control group (SMD -5.71, [95% CI: -10.61, -0.81]). Pain was reported using the Visual Analogue Scale (0- 100 VAS) in adults and age appropriate scales for the children, either the Children and Infant's Post -operative Pain Scale (CHIPPS, 0 -23 months), Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability Scale (FLACC, 2- 7 years), or the Revised Faces Pain Scale (FPS- R, older children). Adult BW pain was reduced when treated with ASCS (SMD -0.62, [95%CI: -0.90, - 0.35]). One study on pain when treated with ASCS (SMD -6.80, [95%CI: -7.30, - 6.30]) and a second study reported low pain scores in both ASCS (median 1.7, IQR 1.3 -2.1) and control (median 1.6, IQR 1.3 -2.3) groups and not significantly different (p< 0.444). Pain in children with BW was reduced (SMD - 0.24 [95%CI: -1.56, 1.08]) when treated with ASCS. Itch was reported in two s tudies. Adult BW reported no difference in incidence of itch between ASCS and control groups. Adult DSW reported no difference in itch intensity between ACSC and control. When compared to the control group, adult BW treated with ACSC (OR 1.52 [95% CI: 0.25, 9.27]) had 52% higher odds for surgical wound infection when compared to control. Conversely, adult DSW had 81% lower odds of cellulitis when treated with ASCS (OR 0.19, 95%CI: 0.01 to 4.11). Pediatric BW treated with ASCS had higher odds of sepsis and s urgical wound infection (OR 3.00 [95%CI: 0.09, 95.17]) compared to control. Need for further surgery increased for BW patients treated with ASCS by 38% (OR 1.38 [95%CI: 0.46, 4.18]). had 96% lower (OR 0.04 [95%CI: 0.00, 1.25) odds of needing another surgery when treated with ASCS compared to control. The authors reported the certainty of evidence was very low. Author noted study limitations included small number of studies, small sample size of studies, varied measurement of outcomes, and most studies were completed on adults which cannot be directly applied to children. Due to the low certainty of evidence no conclusions can be drawn about the role of ASCS in partial thickness burn injury management. A search of UpToDate and medical textbooks located several references describing the use of RECELL autologous cell harvesting procedure as a spray to cover a burn wound; however no references were located to indicate that RECELL autologous cell harvesting procedure/device has become a generally accepted/standard of care (SOC) procedure in the management of thermal burns.

There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and efficacy of Repriza for reconstructive surgery. Restore \u00ae Orthobiologic Soft Tissue Implant Restore Orthobiologic Soft Tissue Implant (DeP uy Orthopaedics, Inc., Warsaw, IN) is an FDA 510(k) porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) device. Per the FDA it is \"intended to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists, specifically for the reinforcement of soft tissue repaired by sutures or suture anchors during tendon repair surgery, including reinforcement of the rotator cuff, patella, Achilles, biceps, quadriceps, and other tendons.\" It may also be used during general tissue reconstruction of the periosteum. The device is proposed to be reabsorbed and replaced by the patient's own tissue (FDA, 2007). There is insufficient evidence in the published peer-reviewed literature to support the safety and efficacy of Restore. Published studies consist primarily of case reports and in vitro studies. One randomized controlled trial (Bryant et al. , 2016) concluded that it is unlikely that the use of SIS with a standard rotator cuff repair offer s better outcomes for patient with a moderate to large rotator cuff tear than surgery without SIS . Page 95 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Bryant et al. (2016) conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=62) to compare the effectiveness of rotator cuff repair with (n=34) and without (n=28) the use of a porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) for patients with moderate to large rotator cuff tears. For patients randomized to receive the SIS, a Restore Orthobiologic Impl ant was extended over the repaired rotator cuff tendon and the tuberosity to which the tendon was attached and then sutured in place. The primary outcome was whether or not the patient had failed the procedure. Patients underwent standardized magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) of the rotator cuff one year postoperatively to determine whether the defect had healed and, if it had not healed completely, whether the remaining full - thickness defect had increased by > 5 mm in any dimension from the immediate postoperative appearance. If such a defect was detected, the repair was classified as having failed. Secondary outcomes included pain, range of motion and quality of life. At the one- year follow -up the overall rate of failure was just under 60%. There was no significant difference in the absolute risk of failure between the two groups (p=0.33) or for any of the patient - reported outcomes at one year. Differences between groups in self -reported outcomes were consistently in favor of the control group, but the difference was small. There was no statistically significant difference (p =0.50 ) between groups in the number of days to being narcotic and pain free. From the SIS group, one patient experienced a deep infection six weeks postoperatively that required surgical washout and one patient experienced a rupture of the biceps tendon 12 months postoperatively that required surgical repair. Two patients experienced transient slight fever and warmth around the wound at week six. In the control group, one patient required a revision at 18 months; one required a manipulation of the shoulder joint at 3 and 12 months postoperatively and one patient had a superficial wound infection. Limitations of the study include: small patient population; number of patients lost to follow- up (n=7), six patient s did not undergo preoperative MRI; six patients did not undergo postoperative MRA; variety of tear sizes, muscle atrophy , fatty infiltration, and reparability (i.e., medialization or remaining defect); and the short -term follow -up. Additional dat a with large populations and long- term follow -ups are needed to establish the clinical utility of Restore Orthobiologic Implant for this indication. The authors concluded that it is unlikely that the use of SIS with a standard rotator cuff repair will offer superior outcomes to patient with a moderate to large rotator cuff tear.

SkinTE SkinTE (PolarityTE\u00ae, Salt Lake City, UT) is an autologous, homologous product proposed for skin repair, reconstruction, replacement, supplementation and regeneration. SkinTE is proposed for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, surgical reconstruction, burns, scar revision, traumatic injuries, and replacement of skin grafts or failed flap coverage. The provider takes a small, full -thickness skin sample from the patient, places it in a vial, adds the supplied crystalloid solution and antibiotic, packages the specimen in a Nanocool\u00ae container, and sends the sample to PolarityTE in the \"H arvest Box\". PolarityTE develops the SkinTE product using their \"platform technology\" with no additional cell or tissue source from another human and returns the product in a Page 98 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 syringe in the \"Deployment Box\" to the provider within 48 -72 hours. The product is placed on the wound and covered with a dressing. SkinTE is marketed as an HCT/P regulated by the FDA solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR 1271 ( PolarityTE, 2023; CMS , 2018). There is insufficient evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of SkinTE. Studies are primarily in the form of case reports. Armstrong et al. (2022) conducted an interim analysis of an ongoing multicenter, randomized control trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a single application of autologous heterogeneous skin construct (AHSC) (SkinTE) as adjunctive therapy to standard of care compared to standard of care alone in the treatment in Wagner 1 diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in the first 50 patients. In the AHSC group, a 1\u00d72 cm full thickness harvest of healthy skin was excised from the index limb of each subject using sterile technique and local anesthetic. The harvest site was sutured closed. The harvest was shipped overnight to a Food and Drug Administration- registered biomedical manufacturing facility (PolarityTE, Salt Lake City, UT) and used to manufacture the AHSC (Product, Organisation3). The AHSC was returned to the provider within 48 hours of tissue harvest and applied to the wound within four days after the harvesting procedure. The AHSC was shipped and stored at 4\u00b0C before application. Standard of care included offloading of the DFU (CAM boots or total contact casting, if the subject's foot was too large for a CAM boot, or per the provider's discretion), appropriate sharp or surgical debridement, collagen alginate and appropriate wound care covering, including 4\u00d74 gauze pads, foam, and a multilayer compression bandaging system comprised a soft roll layer, an elastic layer, and a cohesive bandage layer (Dyna -Flex, KCI, St. Paul, MN). The primary endpoint was the proportion of wounds closed at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the mean percent area reduction (PAR), changes in wound quality -of-life (W -QOL short questionnaire), reduced pain (based on the Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]), improvements in peripheral neuropathy by Semmes Weinstein monofilament test, and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and complications. In the AHSC treatment group, 72% (18/25) of wounds were closed versus 32% (8/25) in the standard care group at 12 weeks. There was a significant greater area of healing in the treatment group compared to the control group at four weeks (79% vs 24%, p=0.0002), six weeks 47%, p=0.002), and 12 weeks (88% vs 50%, p=0.012), respectively. There were no significant differences in W -QOL or the Semmes -Weinstein test between groups. Adverse events were noted in 11/25 patients (44%) in the AHSC group and 14/25 (56%) in control group. Two adverse events were related to the treatment of the index ulcer; one infection and one bleeding episode. There were no product related severe adverse events. Two adverse events occurred at the harvest site: pain and cellulitis. Author noted study limitations include ongoing nature of the RCT, lack of blinding, and no follow up beyond 12 weeks. Additional RCT with large patient populations and long term follow ups are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of Skin TE for the treatment of Wagner 1 DFU.

Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix Strattice [formerly LifeCell NJ]), a surgical mesh, an acellular, xenographic tissue matrix derived from porcine dermis. It is FDA 510(k) approved as LTM -RC surgical mesh \"for use as a soft tissue patch to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists and for the surgical repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue membranes. The implant is intended for the reinforcement of soft tissues repaired by sutures or suture anchors, during rotator cuff surgery. Indications for use also include the repair of hernias and/or body wall defects which require the use of reinforcing or bridging mate rial to obtain the desired surgical outcome\" ( Allergan, 2022; FDA, 2007). The Matrix is also available in a perforated form. There is insufficient evidence in the published peer -reviewed literature to support the safety and efficacy of Strattice for any in dication. Breast reconstruction: Life Cell Corporation has proposed Strattice for use during postmastectomy breast reconstruction to support medial repair for breast pocket size and position. In June 2015 the FDA issued a warning letter to LifeCell Corporation stating that the FDA approval for Strattice did not include the use of Strattice for breast reconstruction. Per the FDA, this indication falls outside of the intended use \" because surgical mesh has not been cleared or approved for use in breast reconstructive surgery applications\". The FDA requested that Life Cell \"immediately cease activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix\" for breast reconstruction. Abdominal Wall Defect: Zerbib et al. (2015) conducted a prospective study (n=18) to evaluate the long- term outcomes of Strattice when used as a reinforcement for infected, abdominal wall defects. Subjects had an abdominal wall defect with enterocutaneous fistula or infected prosthetic mesh, considered to be grade IV. The primary outcome measure was the hernia recurrence rate. Follow -ups ranged from 3 -22 months (median, 13 months). Length of hospitalizations ranged from 4- 56 days (median, 13 days). Fourteen patients were evaluated. Postoperative complications included skin dehiscence (n=3), wound infection (n=2), skin necrosis (n=1), and seroma (n=2). At the last follow- up, six patients (43 %) experienced abdominal wall defect recurrence, three mesh infections and three enterocutaneous fistula patients. After 13 months of follow -up, 57% of patients had a clean and solid abdominal wall. No mesh exposition was observed and no Strattice removals were performed. Limitations of the study include the small patient population, short -term follow -ups, patients lost to follow -up and lack of a comparator. Abdominal Wall Ostomy : Fleshman et al. (2013) conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled (n=113) to assess the safety and efficacy of Strattice dermal matrix for parastomal reinforcement in patients undergoing standard end-stoma reconstructions for permanent abdominal wall ostomy. Strattice was applied in the study group (n=55) but not in the control group (n=58). The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of parastomal hernia by the 24- month follow -up. Secondary outcome measures included a comparison of early (30 days) and late (>30 days) stoma -related complication, as well as quality- of-life measurements. At the 24- month follow -up, there was no significant difference in the incidence of parastomal hernias between the two groups, intraoperative complications and blood loss and quality of life scores. Strattice did not significantly reduce the incidence of parastomal hernia. Limitations of the study include the inclusion of ileostomy and colostomy patients, heterogeneity of operative procedures and loss of patients to follow -up (n=12). Hernia Repair: Bellows et al. (2014) conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Strattice (n=84) vs. UltraPro (Ethicon, Semerville, -free hernioplasty. Ultrapor is a lightweight, partially abosorbable, polypropylene mesh. Subjects were adult males, age 18 years, with a primary, unilateral, non-emergent inguinal hernia. The hernia types were indirect (5 4 %), direct (31 %), pantaloon (14 %), and other (1 %). Data reported herein are the three months follow -up results of an ongoing 24- month study. The primary endpoint is resumption of activities of daily living (ADL) at the one -year Page 100 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 follow -up. Secondary outcome measures include long -term pain (persistent groin pain or discomfort affecting ADLs for more than three months postoperatively), postoperative complications, and incidence of recurrence. The average mesh size was significantly larger in the Ultrapro group (p=0.002). The mean surgical time was significantly less in the Ultrapro group (p=0.02). There were no significant differences between the two groups in duration of hospitalization. Six patients in the UltraPro group vs. three in the Strattice group had an overnight stay. At the three -month follow -up, there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence or type of wound complications (p=0.069), restrictions of ADL, postoperative groin pain (p=0.25), and C -reactive protein level. There was significantly less pain reported in the first three postoperative days in the Strattice group (p<0.05) and no hernia recurrences. However after the first three days there was no reported advantage of Strattice in terms of chronic pain. There was no advantage to using Strattice over the synthetic mesh. Limitations of the study include the short -term follow -up, heterogeneity of hernia types and absence of female patients. Itani et al. (2012) conducted the Repair of Infected or Contaminated Hernias (RICH) prospective, multicenter study (n=80) to evaluate the clinical outcomes of open repair of ventral incisional hernia of contaminated abdominal defects using Strattice. Patients were age 18 years with hernias 9 centimeters 2 (cm2) and reparable using a single sheet (up to 20 X 20 cm) of Strattice. Hernia and the defects were classified as grade 3 (n=60) or grade 4 (n=20). The midline was restored, and primary closure was achieved in 64 patients; the defect was bridged in 16 patients. Strattice was placed in the retrorectus or intraperitoneal space as an underlay and as an on- lay in three patients. The primary outcome was the incident of wound events (e.g., inflammation, seroma, hematoma, dehiscence, reoperation). At 24 months postoperative, 95 wound events were experienced by 53 patients including 22 seromas. There were 28 unique, infection- related events in 24 patients. There were 15 hernia recurrences at 12 months and 22 at 24 months. Seven patients underwent repair within the study period. Limitations of the study include the small heterogeneous patient population, short -term follow -up and lack of a comparator. Stravix Stravix (Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Columbia, MD) is a cryopreserved human placental tissue comprised of umbilical amnion and Wharton's jelly, a gelatinous substance within the umbilical cord.

It is available in 2x7 cm, 4x7 cm, 6x10 cm and 8x 12 cm sizes. On April 16, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) orde red manufacturers of surgical mesh intended for transvaginal repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) to stop selling and distributing these products. Boston Scientific stop ped global sales of its transvaginal mesh products indicated for pelvic organ prolapse: Xenform Soft Tissue Repair Matrix (Boston Scientific, 2019) . There is limited evidence primarily in the form of case series with small patient populations (n=28- 45) and one year follow -ups to support the safety and efficacy of Xenform. Studies investi gated Xenform for the treatment of cystocele and/or rectocele defects and Peyronie's disease (Caraceni, et al., 2016; Goldstein, et al., 2010). Goldstein et al. noted that this clinical trial was the first study to investigate XenForm for pelvic floor reconstruction among patients with pelvic organ prolapse. XenMatrix Surgical Graft XenMatrix ( Becton, Dickinson non- crosslinked regenerative porcine collagen matrix proposed for hernia and abdominal wall repair. The grafts are created using a patented AquaPure Process that removes the cells, leaving an open collagen scaffold. Brennan Medical received FDA 510(k) approval for porcine dermal matrix \"intended for implantation to reinforce soft tissue where weakness exists and for surgical repair of damaged or ruptured soft tissue membranes. XenMatrix is specifically indicated for: plastic and reconstructive s or other tendons. Porcine Dermal Matrix is not intended to replace normal body structure or provide the full mechanical strength to support tendon repair of the rotator cuff, other tendons ( BD, 2023; FDA, 2011). Clinical trials with data supporting the safety and efficacy of XenMatrix are lacking. Studies are primarily in the form of retrospective reviews and in vitro studies. XenoSure \u00ae Biologic Patch (formerly PeriPatch) XenoSure Biologic Inc., Ontario, Canada), a processed bovine pericardial patch was FDA approved as PeriPatch (PM Devices Inc., British Columbia, Canada).

Literature Review - Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analysis Abdominal Wall Reconstruction: Following a systematic review of 40 studies (37 retrospective reviews), Janis et al. (2012) concluded that there is a lack of high- level data to define the precise role of acellular dermal matrix and guidelines for its use for abdominal reconstruction guidelines. Hernia recurrence, the primary outcome measure, ranged from 0 -80%. Limitations of the studies included small, heterogeneous patient populations (n=5-240); short -term follow -ups (0-68 months); heterogeneity in surgical techniques; variable starting points of the studies; wide variety of clinical indications for reconstruction (e.g., ventral hernia; incisional hernia, abdominal compartment syndrome, tumor resection, fascial defects, contaminated abdominal wall); variety of positions of matrices; conflicting reports regarding superiority of underlay vs. overlay techniques; variety in the number of matrix layers used; and use of matrices in combinations with other techniques making it difficult to evaluate the benefit of the matrix alone. Zhong et al. (2011) conducted a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on acellular dermal matrix (ADM) used during abdominal wall reconstruction. Thirty case series (n=4) and retrospective reviews (n=26) met inclusion criteria. No ra ndomized controlled trials or systematic reviews were found. Studies included the use of porcine acellular dermal matrix and human acellular dermal matrix. The outcomes studied included hernia recurrence, abdominal wall laxity, delayed wound healing, infection and seroma. The incidence of postoperative/recurrent hernia ranged from 0% -80%, and the incidence of abdominal wall laxity was largely unreported. Delayed healing occurred in up to 64% of patients with infection -related complications (e.g., surgical site infections, cellulitis, deep/intrabdominal abscesses) reported as high as 40%. Types of ADM, technique, and types of fascia repair and suture used varied. The authors concluded that there was a paucity of high- level evidence comparing ADM with other methods interfering with the ability of physicians to make data- driven recommendations on clinical indications, surgical techniques and outcomes following ADM assisted abdominal wall reconstruction. Amniotic Allografts for Use in Bariatric and Gynecologica l Procedures : Abstracts included a Cochrane review (Bosteels, et al ., 2017) on anti -adhesion therapy following operative hysteroscopy for treatment of female subfertility. Studies using human amniotic membrane grafting vs. no grafting were included. The authors concluded that the clinical effectiveness of anti -adhesion treatment for improving key reproductive outcomes or for decreasing intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) following operative hysteroscopy in subfertile women remained uncertain. A pilot randomized controlled trial (n=45) of women with severe adhesions allocated the women to one of three groups \u2014insertion of intrauterine balloon only, fresh amnion graft or dried amnion graft. Outcomes were significantly better with amnion graft that intrauterine balloon alone (p=0.003) and outcomes were better with fresh amnion than with dried amnion (p=0.01). Additional studies with larger patient populations are needed to Page 110 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 validate the effectiveness of amniotic graft for this indication. No evidence was found to suppor t the use of amniotic membrane in bariatric surgery. Dural Sealants: Kinaci et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the efficacy of dural sealants in preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage following cranial surgery . Studies describing regular cranial procedures combined with the use of any dural sealant reporting CSF leakage were included. The primary outcome measure was CSF leakage of any origin. Secondary outcomes were incidental leakage through the skin, pseudome ningocele formation (subcutaneous or epidural collection of CSF) and surgical -site infection. Twenty studies (n=3682 procedures) met inclusion criteria and were primarily in the form of retrospective reviews and case series. Ten comparative studies (n=2321 ), including three randomized controlled trials, comparing sealant vs no sealant were included in the meta- analysis. There was no significant difference between the two groups in CSF leakage. Meta- analyses for secondary outcomes showed no significant difference between the number of incisional CSF leakage or in the pseudomeningocele formation. Surgical -site infection was seen less in the sealant group than the control group. The number of patients with surgical -site infection in the sealant group was 10 of 1006 (1.0%) versus 60 of 1062 (5.6%) in the control group. Overall, adverse events were not reported and when they were, the direct relationship between sealant use and adverse event was not objectively confirmed. Author -noted limitations of this systemati c review included: lack of randomized controlled trials; patients receiving rescue therapy in the control group with other types of sealants or grafts to obtain watertight closure were not excluded; high risk of bias in the comparative cohort studies; heterogeneity of the patient populations and sealants used; variation in the number of CSF leakages; and differentiation in leakage between supra- and infratentorial craniotomies could not be made. The authors concluded that studies with greater methodologic quality, including randomized controlled trials are warranted. Fibrin Sealants: Esposito et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review of the literature to investigate the safety and efficacy of fibrin sealants that are used as dural sealants to prevent and/or treat cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Thirty -two studies enrolled 2935 patients who were exposed to fibrin sealant. Seven studies that only included safety data were included and used for safety analysis. Three studies were randomized controlled trials. The remaining studies were prospective case series and retrospective reviews. The studies investigated fibrin glue for the treatment of acute intraoperative CSF leaks, prevention of postoperative CSF leaks, and treatment of persisting CSF leaks. Overall, few or no adverse events were reported in most of the studies. Limitations of the studies included: limited number of randomized controlled trials, heterogeneity in the definition of postoperative CSF leak; limited number of studies (n=2) that discussed fibrin sealants for persistent CSF leaks; variations in surgical technique; variety of fibrin glues that were used did not allow comparison of products; heterogeneity in patient populations (e.g., age, sex, race, medical condition); and variation in use of secondary treatments (i.e., medical therapies, interventional strategies). Due to the limitations of the studies, firm conclusions could not be made regarding the benefit of fibrin sealants. Well -designed and powered randomized clinical trials are needed to support the safety and establish the efficacy of these sealants. Fistula Plugs: Nasseri et al. (2016 ) conducted a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the efficacy of fistula plugs (AFPs) in treating fistula- in-ano in patients with Crohn's disease. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Eight were nonrandomized prospective and four were retrospective reviews. A total of 84 patients (n=1-20 per study), age 18- 72 years (median 45 years) and follow -up of 3- 24 months (median nine months) were included i n the analysis. The total success rate (i.e., closure of the fistula tract) was achieved by 49/84 patients. Two out of five patients had success with recurrent fistula., The overall success rate with Surgisis was 48/80 and one out of four patients for Gore Bio-A. Five studies reported a recurrence rate of 13.6% (3/22 patients). The authors were unable to draw firm conclusions due to the limitations of the studies. The procedure appeared safe with little morbidity and low risk of incontinence. Limitations of the studies as noted by the authors included; heterogeneity of study design; small patient population; lack of statistical significance in outcomes; grouping of fistulas in Crohn's disease with other types of anal fistulas introducing ambiguity; short -term follow -up and heterogeneity of follow -up times; and various confounding factors (e.g., use of steroids or immunosuppresants, previous use of seton stitch to aid in healing and variation in surgical technique) and lack of reporting of these factors. The a uthors noted that the outcomes may have been worse if longer follow -ups had been reported and that it was unclear whether failure occurred as a result of technical error or owing to the pathology of the fistula despite use the correct surgical technique. Page 111 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 In a systematic review, O'Riordan et al. (2012) identified 56 articles that investigated anal fistula plugs for the treatment of Crohn's (n=42) and non -Crohn's disease (n=488). Eight studies were retrospective, ten were prospective cohorts, and two were r andomized controlled trials. Patient population ranged 4 -60 patients. Included studies involved patients with and without Crohn's disease that could be differentiated and a mean or median follow -up of three months or greater. The longest follow -up was 24.5 months. Patients with rectovaginal, anovaginal, rectourethral, or ileal -pouch vaginal plug extrusion rate was 8.7% (n=46). In patients with non -Crohn's disease, fistula closure ranged from 0.2- 0.86. The overall success rat e for patients with Crohn's was 54.8% (23 of 42 patients) and 54.3% of patients (265 of 488 patients) without Crohn's. Limitations of the study included: heterogeneity of operative technique, perioperative care; operative position, and anesthesia type; and the retrospective and non -comparative study designs. Frey Syndrome: Li et al. (2013) conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of grafts for the prevention of Frey syndrome following parotidectomy. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (n=1098) met inclusion criteria. Subjects were age 9 -85 years and had undergone various parotidectomy procedures using various types of acellular dermal. Follow -ups ranged from 3- 60 months. Meta -analysis of nine studies showed that an acellular dermis matrix graft vs. no graft significantly reduced the risk of Frey syndrome (p<0.0001). Six studies showed that a muscle flap graft versus no graft also significantly reduced the risk of Fey syndrome compared to no g raft (p<0.001). When the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) graft was introduced as active treatment, there was no significant difference between the groups. One study reported no statistical difference between the study and control groups when acellular dermas matrix was compared to a muscle flap graft. (p=0.70). No serious adverse events were reported. Frey syndrome had an incidence of 8.3% in the acellular dermis group and 11.1% in the muscle flap group. Limitations of the analysis include a di screpancy in the number of subjects with Frey syndrome dependent on whether a subjective vs. objective assessment was made. Very mild Frey syndrome cannot be detected by a subjective assessment. Other limitations include heterogeneity in the types of parot id lesions and surgical procedures, small patient populations and possibility of selection bias of the included studies. More RCTs with large, homogeneous patient populations and long -term follow -up are needed to validate that grafts are effective in preventing Frey syndrome. Hernia Repairs: Trippoli et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the differences in various biological products for the treatment of primary and incisional ventral hernias. Included studies met the following criteria: treatment of primary and incisional abdominal hernia; mesh derived from porcine dermis or porcine intestinal submucosa or bovine pericardium or bovine or fetal dermis; may or may not involve ''cross - linking of collagen''; end- point was 30-day follow -up of surgical site infection and/or relapse rate after follow -up of at least 12 months. The five available biological meshes of porcine derivative available in the market at the time of the analysis were Strattice, Permacol, Fortiva, Sur gisis, and Peri -guard, Veritas, Bioripar and Tutomesh. Eleven trials that evaluated five meshes met inclusion criteria. Nine studies were single -arm (prospective or retrospective), and two studies were based on a comparative design. The meshes included in investigating Fortiva, Veritas, Bioripar and Tutomesh. Among all comparisons carried out within these biological meshes, one significant difference was found. Permacol (a crosslinked mesh) showed a lower recurrence rate at 12 months than Strattice (a non- cross - linked mesh) (p=0.001) , suggesting that crosslinking may str engthen a mesh. Overall the studies generally showed a poor methodological quality. There was wide variability in the surgical wound infections between studies and the 12- month relapse rates (n=4 studies). Additional author -noted limitations of the studies included the limited available clinical information, small patient populations, short -term follow -ups, and uncontrolled study designs. Other limitations are the heterogeneity of the wound types and retrospective study designs. In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence in the published literature to support the use of biological mesh for hernia repair. Data do not indicate if a porcine vs. bovine or cross -linked vs non -crosslinked mesh should be used. Patient selection criteria have not been established. In a 2014 systematic review, Cross et al. reported that the data for biological mesh products in ventral hernia repair in contaminated fields were limited. Sixteen studies (n=554) met inclusion criteria. All of the studies were case series with the lar gest patient population being 116. Six different mesh products were used. The authors recommended that caution be used when considering the use of biological meshes because there is a paucity of controlled trials and none of the products are FDA approved f or this indication. Page 112 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Ferzoco (2013) conducted a systematic review to assess outcome in patients who underwent repair of contaminated or infected ventral incisional hernias using a biologic mesh. The eleven studies that met inclusion criteria used studies were retrospective chart reviews and included a total of 677 patients. Reported hernia recurrence varied widely and ranged from 0%-50%. Wound dehiscence rates varied from 0%-35.5% and mesh explantation -23%. Occurrence rates seroma, fistula, evisceration, intrabdominal bleeding, repeat surgery, and hematoma were typically not reported. The most commonly reported reasons for a secondary surgical procedure included repair of recurrent hernia, mesh removal, drainage of seroma, and drainage of surgical site abscess. Prospective studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of biologic mesh in the treatment of infect ed ventral incisional hernias. Beale et al. (2012) conducted a systematic review to evaluate the use of biological mesh in the repair of ventral hernias in adults. Twenty -nine studies met inclusion criteria (n=1257). Four studies used Permacol (n=64), three used Surgisis (n=87) and 23 used AlloDerm (n=1106). Primary outcomes were hernia recurrence and surgical site occurrences (hematoma, seroma, wound infection, dehiscence or graft removal). 20.8% AlloDerm, 10.9% (e.g., hematoma, seroma, wound, infection, dehiscence, or need for graft removal). The authors noted that it was difficult to identify a uniformly accepted technique for the placement of the biologic mesh. Limitations of the studies included: retrospective study design (n=27 studies), heterogeneity of surgical technique and placement of the product, lack of reporting of hernia recurrence and complication rates, paucity of data and older studies . Well designed, prospective randomized controlled trials with large patient populations and long -term follow -up are needed to evaluate biological mesh for ventral hernia repair. Kissane and Itani (2012) conducted a systematic review to evaluate acellular dermal matrix for complex ventral incisional hernia repair. Eight single center studies (n=635) met criteria and used either -ECM\" mesh) (n=91) study was prospective and used Strattice in a one- stage repair of infected or contaminated hernias. Seven studies were retrospective in design. There was a recurrence rate of 21 percent after 25.8 months with the highest rate being in the AlloDerm patients. Total percentage of complications (e.g., wound -related, eventration, mesh rejection) in the AlloDerm hernia repairs was percent. Other postoperative peritonitis, subfascial abscesses, intraabdominal hematoma, and mesh reaction. Because the heterogeneity of the patient population, ventral incisional hernia grades, type of meshes used, surgical techniques, and length of follow -up, a meta -analysis could not performed. Other limitations of the studies included: minimal reporting of patient inclusion cr iteria and demographics; diverse patient comorbidities; retrospective study designs; lack of controls; and short -term follow -up (mean 25.8 months). Smart et al. (2012) conducted a systematic review to assess the clinical outcomes of biological meshes used in abdominal wall hernia repairs. Forty -five randomized controlled trials, case series and retrospective reviews met inclusion criteria including: 23 studies on AlloDerm, seven on Surgisis, ten on Permacol and seven on other meshes. Most articles were re trospective reviews or uncontrolled prospective case series with small heterogeneous, patient populations, poorly described methodology and short -term follow -ups (3 -52 months). AlloDerm recurrence rates ranged from 0% -100% and were inferior compared to pol ypropylene and Surgisis. In infected fields, recurrence rates were high at short and medium -term follow -up. Concerns were reported regarding bulging at the repair site and stretching of the graft. \"There is little evidence to support the use of AlloDerm in most of the situation where a biological mesh is indicated.\" The recurrence rates with Permacol were 0%-15%. Outcomes in Permacol studies were conflicting and \"important methological weaknesses exist\" representing a low level of evidence. Outcomes with Surgisis were also conflicting. Some studies reported a recurrence rate of 0% -5.3% regardless of whether the surgery was performed in a clean or infected field, while other studies reported a recurrent rate as high as 39% in dirty fields. One study was termi nated early due to the high recurrence rates in a Surgisis group with clean cases. According to the authors, insufficient or minimal data in the form of retrospective reviews were found for Veritas, Xenmatrix, CollaMend and Strattice and only case al. (2016) conducted a systematic review to assess the evidence on the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid (HA) compared to placebo or other agents f or promoting chronic wound healing. Nine randomized controlled trials (n=865) met inclusion criteria. The authors noted that there was better quality Page 113 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 of evidence for mixed arterial and venous ulcers than for venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. Over all, the studies provided little evidence regarding the claimed effects of HA for this indication. Some mixed evidence suggested that HA reduced the intensity of pain for mixed arterial and venous ulcers. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of HA for the treatment of chronic wound healing. Laryngotracheal and Pharyngeal Reconstruction: Hui et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review to evaluate the safety and efficacy of acellular dermal matrices in laryngotracheal and pharyngeal reconstruct ion. Eleven studies (n=170) including three retrospective review , five case series and three case reports met inclusion criteria. Eight studies reported on ADM use in oncological reconstruction. Seven studies used AlloDerm, three studies used Heal -All Oral Biofilm (Zhenghai Biotech, Yantai, China) and one case report used Permacol. Follow -ups varied from two weeks to 42 months. The methodology of the studies was poor. Other limitations included the small patient populations, and heterogeneity of surgical pr ocedures and diagnosis. Overall, the studies provided incomplete descriptive detail concerning peri -operative radiation dosing and scheduling, the surgeon's experience using dermal grafts, graft thickness, and defect size. The authors stated that due to the limited number and heterogeneity of the cases, conclusions could not be made regarding the impact of acellular dermal matrix use on post -operative stricture and tracheal or pharyngeal reconstruction. Orthopedic Sports Medicine: Riboh et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the evidence for amniotic membrane products used in orthopedic sports medicine. Eighty articles were considered relevant to the study. Fifty -five of the articles were narrative and 25 articles described preclinical and clinical trials of amniotic products for orthopedic sports medicine. The primary indications being explored included: cartilage restoration, ligament and tendon healing, nonoperative treatment of knee osteoarthritis, and plantar fasciitis. Due to the low quality of the studies, a systematic review summary and meta- analysis for the use of these products for this indication could not be conducted. According to the authors the current body of evidence in is heavily biased tow ard in vitro and animal studies, with little to no human clinical data. Tendon and Ligament Repairs: Chen et al. (2009) conducted a systematic review of biological and synthetic scaffolds used for tendon and ligament repairs. Out of 378 identified articl es, 47 clinical trials met inclusion criteria. Of the 47 articles, 16 clinical trials included four commercial biological scaffolds (i.e., five included the use of Restore, six used GraftJacket, four used Zimmer (formerly Permacol), and one study included both Restore and GraftJacket. After review of the data, the authors reported the following: Restore - \"Restore or scaffolds from small intestine submucosal are ineffective in the reinforcement of large rotator cuff tears and currently not recommended for use in cuff tendon repair.\" They identified other scaffolds made from small intestine submucosal (i.e. Oasis, Surgisis, and CuffPatch [Organogenesis, Inc., Canton, MA]) and stated that \"extra care should be taken to monitor adverse events when applied in patients.\" GraftJacket - \"Satisfactory results have been described using GraftJacket for skin lesion and abdominal wall repair\". No reports of inflammatory response, edema or postoperative infection have been reported and patients seemed to tolerate it w ell. However, recurrent tears were noted in 30% of patients in two studies. Zimmer (Permacol) - Two retrospective reviews (n=10 each) reported increased pain relief and range- of- motion following implantation, but two other smaller studies reported recurrent tears, aggravated pain and decrease range- of-motion. Foreign body reaction was noted in several of the patients. TissueMend - No published animal or clinical studies were found. They noted that TissueMend has been reported to contain higher genetic materials compared to other products which raise concern re human application. OrthADAPT - No published animal or clinical studies could be found According to Chen et al., the studies in this systematic review were primarily in the form of case reports, cas e series, or retrospective reviews and limited by small patient populations (n=1- 30), short term follow -ups (3 months -5 years) and lack of comparison to established methods of treatment. One of the major concerns with these products is biocompatibility and inflammatory response associated with foreign body rejection. The authors also noted that many scaffolds were FDA approved without proper animal studies or evidence -based clinical trials. Technology Assessments Page 114 of 169 Medical Coverage Policy : 0068 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies: In a Rapid Respond Report on biological mesh, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) (2010; updated 2015) presented a summary of findings on biological mesh for breast reconstruction, pelvic organ prolapse, mucogingi val surgery, inguinal hernia repair, urethroplasty, diabetic foot ulcers, and decompressive hemicraniectomy. The report included systematic reviews, meta -analyses, technology assessments, randomized and non- randomized clinical trials, economic studies and guidelines. CADTH stated that the evidence of clinical effectiveness and safety was generally positive or neutral. However, the studies were of insufficient high quality to support the use of these products and their optimal place in therapy has not been established. Examples of commercially available products noted by CADTH included: Medical, St. Paul, MN) Pelvicol (CR Bard, Hill, NJ FortaGen ( Organogenesis, Canton, MA SurgiMend Veritas\u00ae St. Paul, MN) Tutopatch\u00ae (Tutogen Medical Inc., West Paterson, NJ) UroPatch (Shelhigh, Inc. Union, NJ) Zyplast Professional Societies/Organizations American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons In 2016, the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons published clinical practice guidelines for the management of anorectal abscess, fistula- in-ano, and rectovaginal fistula (Vogel, et al). The guidelines states that the fistula plug is a relatively ineffective treatment for fistula- in-ano. The guidelines di d not include the use of collagen plug for rectvaginal fistulas as they state the success of of this intervention has proven to be prohibitively poor. American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS): In the Choosing Wisely recommendations (2015), AUGS stated that synthetic or biologic grafts should not be used during posterior vaginal repair of rectocele for women with symptoms of a posterior vaginal wall bulge or difficulty with defecation. AU GS stated that the use of these products does not improve patient outcom es. New England Regional Society of the American Society of Colon: Based on data from a prospective, multicenter registry of 245 patients who underwent surgical intervention for anal fistula, the New England Regional Society of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (Hyman, et al., 2009) reported that the best healing rates occurred following fistulotomy (87%) and the worse healing rates occurred following anal fistula plug (32%) (p=0.001). They stated that randomized controlled trials comparing various treatment options for anal fistulas \"are clearly needed.\" Use Outside of the US Tissue -engineered skin substitutes are offered outside the US by several companies.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (United Kingdom) (2015; updated 2019 ) guidance on the prevention and management of diabetic foot ulcers stated that dermal or skin substitutes should be considered as an adjunct to standard care only when healing of treated ulcers does not progress and should only be used on the advice of a multidisciplinary foot care service. NICE does not recommend any specific products. In a 2019 guidance document, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (United Kingdom) stated that current evidence on the safety and efficacy of bioprosthetic plug insertion for anal fistula is adequate to support the use of this procedure provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance, consent and audit. In the 2011 guidance document on inpatient management for diabetic foot problems, NICE recommended that dermal or skin substitutes not be used for treatment unless it is part of a clinical trial. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) (United Kingdom) (2017) guidance on processed nerve allografts to repair peripheral nerve discontinuities stated that the current safety and efficacy evidence is adequate for use of processed nerve allografts for digital nerves. The evidence on efficacy on other sites is inadequate and should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent and audit or research. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Medical technologies guidance published November 2014, \"The R eCell Spray -On Skin system for treating skin loss, scarring and depigmentation after burn injury states that the ReCell Spray -On Skin system shows potential to improve healing in acute burns. However, there is insufficient evidence on its use in clinical practice, particularly in relation to which patients might benefit most from its use, to support the case for its routine adoption in the NHS. Research is recommended to address uncertainties about the claimed patient and system benefits of the ReCell Spray -On Skin system. NICE notes that they have reviewed the evidence in August 2020 and found nothing new that affects the recommendations in this guidance. Ontario Health Technology Assessment: An Ontario Health Technology Assessment (2021) on skin substitutes for adults with diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers that are difficult to heal concluded that skin substitutes combined with standard care are more effective in promoting complete wound healing than standard care alone.
