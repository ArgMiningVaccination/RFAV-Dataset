Synergistic Therapies I encourage and recommend all my patients to explore additional therapies that will support their health and wellbeing. At the office, we provide Light Therapy and a detoxification footbath, both of which may be rented for at-home use. Additionally, aromatherapy is an approachable and powerful holistic therapy with incredible health benefits. Light Therapy Light therapy is the application of light, pulsed at research-proven frequencies and applied to the skin for multiple therapeutic benefits. These include: Supplying the body with non-invasive healing Increasing circulation of blood Stimulating collagen Increasing lymphatic system activity Reducing pain in inflammation Reducing stress [Click here](/s/Light-Therapy.pdf) to view a PDF with more information. Detox Footbath The EB(Energy Balance) Cellular Cleanse Therapy uses the 4,000 pores on your feet to extract toxins built up in your body. Exposure to toxins comes from air pollution, acid rain, fertilizer, contaminated water or food, over-chlorinated & fluoridated water, growth hormones present in many foods, and antibiotics from direct and indirect sources. The footbath stimulates your cells to wake and purge at a higher rate. It's like jumpstarting your body's own natural detoxification process. Resulting in the restoration and normalization of the body's correct PH balance and energy levels. [Click here](/s/EB-Detox-Footbath.pdf) to receive a PDF with more information. Cymatherapy In a simple 30 minute session, the AMI 750 applies sound trans-dermally through the feet or the hands via the meridian channels in the body and will support your health and keep the body de-stressed.
