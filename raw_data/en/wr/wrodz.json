There has been a sort of \"void\" in my transparency about my cancer experience for the past few years since I started writing my blog. I purposely left out a big part of my natural approach to cancer because I wasn't ready to write about it yet.9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: Really W ork? - AntiCancerMom https://www .anticancermom.com/hcg-cancer-test/ 2/52MI've written many times about WHAT I chose to monitor my cancer: the hCG Cancer Test, but I've never shared much else about it. You may know that I used the hCG Cancer Test and chose not to use CT/PET scans after my initial diagnosis, but I haven't talked about my experience with the test, WHY I chose it, or HOW it works. I first heard about the hCG Test when I read Bill Henderson's book \"Cancer-Free: Your Guide to Gentle, Nontoxic Healing.\" He learned about it from Ruth Sackman , a 92 year old woman who lost her daughter to conventional care of leukemia and afterwards went on a mission to help others heal in a less destructive way. She was convinced the hCG test was accurate and saw the fruits of Dr. Navarro's labor over and over again through accurate test numbers from the people she was coaching through their natural healing of cancer. In this post I will explore the history of the hCG test, how it works, how to prepare and send off the test, and how to use it for monitoring cancer. I've also learned a few tricks on how to make this process of taking an hCG test really quite simple. y next post will discuss my experience with the hCG Cancer Test over the past almost 6 years and will also address a few lingering questions and doubts about the hCG Test that I didn't have time to deal with until now. WHAT IS THE HCG URINE CANCER TEST? (From the Navarro Clinic's official website:) \"Developed in the late 1950s, by the renowned oncologist, the late Dr. Manuel D. Navarro, the test detects the presence of cancer cells even before signs or symptoms develop. Dr. Navarro found HCG to be present in all types of cancers. The test is based on a theory proposed by Howard Beard and other researchers who contend that cancer is related to a misplaced trophoblastic cell that become malignant in a manner similar to pregnancy in that they both secrete HCG. As a consequence, a measure of the amount of HCG found in the blood or urine is also a measure of the degree of malignancy. The higher the number, the greater is the severity of cancer. Urine, as opposed to blood or serum, is the preferred specimen for the test. In 1980, Papapetrou and co-authors reported the correctness of the urine specimen to be used in HCG Immunoassay. In 32 proven cancer cases, the immunoassay test gave 31 positive results using urine while only 12 positive results were reported using blood. HCG has been found to undergo glycosylation in the liver as it travels in the hepatic circulation. Thus, the HCG molecule cannot be detected. The9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: Really W ork? - AntiCancerMom https://www .anticancermom.com/hcg-cancer-test/ 3/52molecule does not undergo this process in the kidney and therefore the molecule remains intact in the urine. The test detects the presence of brain cancer as early as early as 29 months before symptoms appear; 27 months for fibro sarcoma of the abdomen; 24 months for skin cancer; 12 months for cancer of the bones (metastasis from the breast extirpated 2 years earlier). The Navarro Medical Clinic has been performing the HCG test for cancer for many years and continues to offer this service under the direction of Dr. Efren Navarro. Dr. Efren Navarro, the son of the late Dr. Manuel D Navarro is a graduate of Doctor of Medicine from the University of Santo Thomas, School of Medicine and Surgery, Manila Philippines. He finished his residency in Pathology at Mercy Hospital Medical Center in Chicago. In 1994 he became a Hematopathology Fellow at the University of Illinois, Chicago. In 1996, he returned to the Philippines to continue the work of his famous oncologist father, Manuel Navarro, M.D. Currently, many cancer patients take advantage of the diagnostic accuracy of the HCG test as an indicator of the effectiveness of their specific mode of therapy. Thousands of cancer survivors have used this test over the years to keep track of their treatment(s) success and check on the status of their remission. Patients follow a simple direction for preparing a dry extract from the urine sample. The powdery extract is mailed to the Navarro Medical Clinic where the HCG testing is performed.\" WHY USE THE HCG CANCER TEST? MONITORING your natural cancer progress is almost as important as what you decide to treat your cancer with. How will you know your chosen protocol is working if you don't monitor its effect on the cancer? Because I wanted to avoid excessive radiation from scans (and my oncologist was actually very conservative with his use of CT/ PET scans for his patients with slow-growing cancers like myself,) we chose to use hCG testing as another tool in addition to detailed blood panels and physical exams to monitor the behavior of my cancer. The hCG test is also much cheaper than other methods of monitoring. It costs less than $65 for all of the materials and postage to send to the Philippines, where the testing clinic is located. Also, It doesn't require a prescription like many other tests. 9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: Really ork? - https://www .anticancermom.com/hcg-cancer-test/ 4/52HOW DOES THE HCG CANCER WORK? You may be familiar with hCG if you've learned how a pregnancy test works. A human embryo, upon conception begins to release a hormone called human Chorionic Gonadotropin, or hCG. Cancer cells release this same hormone which disguises it, in a sense, from your immune system. The Navarro hCG Urine Test uses the measurement of hCG to detect the amount of abnormally dividing cells in your body by giving you a single number, no matter where the cancer cells are in your body. You use these numbers in a trending fashion, looking for improvement over time. Ideally, you want to get your \"number\" below 50, which is statistically speaking, \"cancer-free\" according to Dr. Navarro. Expect to see your first test result number between 50 and 70 IU if you have been diagnosed with cancer using an additional diagnostic tool (biopsy, MRI, CT/PET etc.) Although certain cancers, primarily involving the reproductive organs, can go as high as 10,000 IU. The most essential number is your second test result number 6-8 weeks after your first TEST (not your result.) This will tell you if what you're doing is working or if you need to make some changes or additions. Remember that generally, a '49 means you no longer have cancer (statistically speaking,) and a '50 or above means you do have cancer (statistically speaking), but some people will plateau at a result above 50 with no active cancer- they simply have residual higher levels of hCG. This is one reason I think the hCG test is valuable in a series of testing. It's important to value how you are FEELING overall as well and of course continue to see your doctor. 9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: Really W ork? - https://www HOW TO PREPARE THE NAVARRO HCG URINE TEST: After several weeks of frustration in trying to find time to write this post, my husband, being as logical as he is says: \"What's so hard about it?

Here are the exact steps from Dr. Navarro's website: Materials: 1. Acetone - can be purchased from the Pharmacy or Hardware or Paint Store. Nail Polish Remover is NOT A SUBSTITUTION.

HOW TO READ AND INTERPRET THE TEST: I personally would not use the hCG Test as a tool to DIAGNOSE whether you have cancer or not, although it wouldn't hurt if you're curious and wanted to keep up with the trending results. I believe it is best used as a trending test, comparing numbers back to back over time to see how your body is responding to a treatment plan. For example, my test numbers over the past few years show gradual decline in TENTHS. I dropped from my first score of 53.0 in 2008 to my next score of 52.2 in 8 weeks. My next test almost two years later (delayed because of pregnancy) was 51.4. 18 months after that, my test was again 51.4, even though medically I've been declared in \"clinical remission\" with complete absence of tumor bulk and symptoms. I'll talk more about my scores in my next post. DOES THE HCG CANCER TEST REALLY WORK?9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: Really W ork? - AntiCancerMom https://www .anticancermom.com/hcg-cancer-test/ 15/52The short answer is- YES, and it's a great option if you are on a strict budget and trying to treat your cancer naturally. But my skepticism with this test lived on for years of testing until I finally learned how to look at my results. Just like the natural therapies I used to treat my cancer, this test just seemed too easy and I remained skeptical. In the beginning of my natural/alternative cancer journey I really struggled with believing that any of this natural cancer stuff really worked. I was EXTREMELY untrusting. So because of that, I was highly sensitive to anyone preaching that cancer could be cured easily with natural methods or monitored cheaply and effectively using a test you administer yourself and mail to the Philippines. My next post will deal with my skepticism and will include my many emails to Dr. Navarro's staff over my questions regarding my test results, along with results from my blog readers. I will also write about some other HCG testing options and also more expensive but reputable alternative cancer tests. Anyone else have experience with HCG testing? Let's talk about it!

I've just hand my 2nd HCG test result and it went up by 2 points from my first 1 (50.5- 52.5). I've been wondering why the rise in HCG levels so to Google I went and I landed on your page. Could it be because of Melatonin? I wasn't taking them before my 1st test and maybe a couple of months into it prior to my 2nd. AntiCancerMom says: July 6, 2021 at 7:42 PM Perhaps, you can email the clinic and ask. Their email is in the comments on this page. Reply Vina Rivera says: July 24, 2021 at 1:51 AM I did but Dr. Navarro said melatonin doesn't interfere with the results of HCG. However, my integrative doctor, who was cc'd in the email confirmed that there were indeed in vitro researches that found melatonin to be one of the causes of rise in HCG levels. She advised me to drop it a week prior to testing next time.Reply Evelyn says: May 5, 2021 at 7:42 PM Why doesn't it say melatonin needs to be stopped on his main website? I've always had negative tests but just received a positive test. I believe I stopped melatonin 3 days before test, but I probably have higher melatonin in my system than the average person as I normally take 36mg at night. I've actually had my hcg tested and a normal level is between 10-85 and mine is over 3000! When/How did they discover melatonin affects the test and do you think it's possible it affected mine?

I think that it is important to share this information because there might be more individuals that are in the same situation as my friend and me and I don't want them to panic thinking that they have cancer. I think worrying about it might cause cancer so it is imperative that they seek different tests to confirm. FYI, Int. Units from 401 - 999 is interpreted as \"Definitely Positive\".

Thank you, Anna Grover AntiCancerMom says: March 7, 2017 at 3:41 PM I am hearing this from more and more people...I still stand that Navarro is a great and affordable way to get a general idea of how your cancer is behaving IF you have been diagnosed through other diagnostics (like circulating tumor cell counts, CT or PET, etc.) For me it has been very accurate but I am suspicious it is affected by other hormones, especially in females with hormonal imbalances. I want to blog about what I've learned, but until then, go with your gut and choose a different or additional tests if needed. -Cortney Reply Chris says: April 8, 2017 at 4:38 AM Hello.

My own experience may be useful to some of your readers. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in June of 2011, biopsy and Gleason score of 6 in 2 quadrants. My family culture is one of conscious but not fanatic diet control and a distrust of medical treatment of chronic diseases. I was not too interested in the rush to treatment that the urologist recommended. A good friend of mine had a pretty good experience with a clinic in Germany where they applied a hyperthermia treatment (theReply9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: Really W ork? - AntiCancerMom https://www .anticancermom.com/hcg-cancer-test/ 27/52principles behind that are interesting). I also learned from him about the hCG tests. I considered hyperthermia as a possible treatment, but as yet have not taken it. My PSA at that time was 5.18, not high really, but cause for investigation. PSA alone is a pretty shaky way to diagnose cancer. I obtained an hCG test kit from Joe Ball and sent a specimen to Navarro labs. Result was 52.6 which was on the positive side, but not alarming. Over the past 5 years, I have had annual checkups at the Oregon Science Health Univ. (not where my original diagnosis was made) and each time a DRE result was \"nothing remarkable\". My PSAs since then have been 5.5, 3.7, 4.1, 5.13, 5.83, 6.58, and 8.04. That certainly has been an upward trend , but the urologist at OHSU says that considering my age (74), it is not too concerning. Over the same period, hCG results have been 52.6 three times in a row, 52.2 three times in a row, 51.8 and now 52.2 again. So according to the hCG results I am pretty stable. My approach to diet has been greater emphasis on fresh and raw fruits and veggies, avoidance of sugar and grains - particularly breads and pastries, most any packaged or fast food, a good multivitamin-multimineral, digestive enzymes and probiotics, Vit D and a suppliment called New Eden which is largely aloe and 11 other vital constituants developed by Dr. Reg McDaniels. Regarding the appearance of the specimen residue when preparing the sample, I have never seen any but a light, white \"dusting\" on the brown filter paper which the Joe Ball kit provides. Seems to be sufficient. Probably would not show at all on white paper. When mailing the specimen, simply declare it as a document with no value. That's legit because the specimen has been completely sterilized by the acetone/alcohol mixture and is completely dry. The Navarro instructions suggest this approach. If you pay through PayPal, be sure to specify US dollars, not Philippine currency. The instructions are clear on that. Just be sure you do. I hope this is useful info. By all means read Ty Bollinger's books, G. Edward Griffith's World Without Cancer, Bill Henderson's works and goggle Dr. Reg McDaniels. God bless you all. Dale Jarmush says: July 13, 2017 at 1:13 PM Hi Rick, ...Sounds like you are doing very well! Re: PSA - Years ago I learned by accident that higher PSA numbers would naturally occur with an enlarged prostate, as I had. Apparently the PSA number tends to be proportional to the prostate volume! So a normal prostate [walnut sized] would expect a normal PSA under 4.0 ...But an enlarged prostate [small orange size] could easily have a normal PSA of 12 to 20 ...BTW: I'm 79 and doing well with the Budwig Protocol in taming Leukemia.Reply9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: ork? - AntiCancerMom https://www .anticancermom.com/hcg-cancer-test/ 28/52 Billy says: November 16, 2016 at 11:44 PM Are the dried sediments suppose to be powder-like or stain-like on the coffee paper?

My husband and I both have a strong family history of cancer, and he himself is a testicular cancer survivor (9 years ago). We have begun the process of testing ourselves and our kids periodically using the Navarro clinic. My husband and I both just got our first results back. His is 51.8 and mine is 50.5. Since both are considered positive, I can't help but be worried we both have cancer. We have three little girls, and I'm just numb. I've already known I would avoid traditional treatments if I ever had cancer, and use natural ones if possible, but as far as getting tested, I'm not sure where to turn now. I don't want scans/radiation if there's a better way first. I know you can't exactly give medical advice, but any ideas on where to turn? Blood work? Re-do the test? (My husband was taking a whole-food multi at the time of the test which contained Vit D, which I didn't know he was taking, and I know that can affect results. We also used plastic cups for urine collection but glass for sample prep, and I just read on your blog that you shouldn't use plastic). Can these things lead to false positives? Thanks in advance for your help! I appreciate your time!Reply AntiCancerMom says: November 14, 2016 at 2:07 PM Hi Christine, that could lead to a false positive.

I say it that way because we are working with an alternative stress treatment that is detecting it but the technician can not diagnose legally. Would this test be something that we could use to prove that there is active cancer in his body? Does the test specify where? Please please get back to me. We don't have insurance (I found this site while looking up Christian alternatives to obamacare) and so have not gone in for a cancer screening. We are spending a lot on therapies to heal his body, so there is not much left for expensive Dr appointments that won't support the road we have chosen for his healing. He is 26 and we have 2 toddlers. Please email me back! Just got the book Cancer:Step Outside The Box. Amazing book! If we had some test result markers to show the proof of it and if what we are doing is working, then the technician we are doing biofeedback with would be able to go alot further, as he cannot tell us much without outside proof of cancer. Thank you in advance!Reply GreenDrinkDiaries says: October 15, 2015 at 3:11 PM Elise! WOW- that is wonderful that you found yourself here. You should find my HOW I BEAT CANCER page very helpful. I was 26 when I was diagnosed also. He is STRONG and has age on his side. Unfortunately doctors in the US, UK, or Aussie don't consider the hcG test as an acceptable measurement. (It's not really meant to diagnose anyway- just to serve as a trending to test to see if you're diagnosed cancer is improving on your protocol.) https://www.anticancermom.com/how-i-beat-cancerReply gug says: January 18, 2016 at 11:06 AM hello, sorry to hear about your husbands health issues.

Perhaps it would help your cancer heal faster and you'd get better results.

Within two weeks of sending off the sample, she had an email from Dr. Navarro with the test results. She recently had breast cancer and a mastectomy, and is doing a lot of natural things to ensure cancer is removed and does not come back. Her result from the HCG test was 52.6. She was a bit worried about it, but I think it is quite a low score for someone recovering from cancer, especially as some HCG remains in the body for a while anyway. She will probably do it again after 2 months to see the trend.Reply T says: March 17, 2016 at 9:05 AM Hi I'm in the UK and thinking of doing this.

When I first pour half of the liquid with the sediments, there would be a lot of sediments. But as the liquid evaporates, so does the sediments. By the time the paper is dry, I can only see a very faint yellow on the paper and only very little white stuff (which I assume are the sediments) sticking to the paper that does not come off. Looking at your photo, it looks like the sediments are like powder that are loose and not sticking to the paper. And they are dark yellow or is it just the color saturation of the picture. I did exactly as the Dr. Navarro's site says, only used acetone like yours 100% pure acetone that means it has one other ingredient, not the one from the hardware store. Then I filtered it. I used 3 papers though because I just held the paper while filtering and did not put it over a strainer. But even so, the goal is to filter, right? Are your sediments also sticking to the paper? Also when you do this procedure, do you stop taking your FOCC for a while? I don't know if that has any effect to estrogen or whatever that can affect the test? Any other info would be appreciated. Thanks.Reply GreenDrinkDiaries says: October 25, 2014 at 9:18 PM Hi Kaye- did you make sure you used the very first morning urine? Yes- my sediments stuck to the paper, but there was usually a thicker layer. The example I used for the pictures seemed to have less sediment for some reason (I think I was more hydrated.) I never stopped taking the CCFO when I tested, just the Vitamin D.Reply Sandra says: August 16, 2014 at 12:22 PM I went on the HCG diet in 2011. In 2013 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Increasing the HCG level in your body activates cancerous cells? Yet, HCG injections and/or drops are readily available.Reply9 Shares 9 3/26/22, 1 1:31 AM The HCG Cancer T est: Really W ork? - AntiCancerMom https://www .anticancermom.com/hcg-cancer-test/ 48/52 * indicates required SubscribeSubscribePingback: My 6 Year Experience with the Navarro HCG Cancer Test | Green Drink Diaries Sign up to receive my weekly newsletter and get my FREE 60+ page Anti-Cancer Lifestyle Guide with 5-Day Meal Plan and over 25 recipes!
