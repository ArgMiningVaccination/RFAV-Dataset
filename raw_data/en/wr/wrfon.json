Student's project or share of a project will be approved by the Division Chief or the course coordinator. Projects qualifying for this elective include (but are not limited to): laboratory or clinical studies which can be completed during 1-2 months, projects initiated previously by the student that can be completed within this period, suitable components of ongoing division projects that would insure achievement of at least 3 subsidiary objectives listed above [2(a)-(e)]. The students will be encouraged to write a brief report at the end of the elective or present their work in a seminar setting. Recommended Reading Material: To be assigned Length: Length: Medicine Subinternship - Harper/Detroit Receiving Hosp Course Prerequisites: Must be an M4 student in good standing who has completed a 3rd year clerkship in Internal Medicine. Description: Students will expand on their Year 3 internal medicine clerkship experience with more intensive involvement in patients experiencing common internal medicine ailments in the hospital setting. Rationale: While the time period between medical school graduation and the start of graduate medical training (internship) may be short, the transformation from medical student to intern is a significant one. New interns are expected to assume higher levels of responsibility and workload in the setting of challenging clinical, social, and emotional contexts. Surveys of residency program directors and empirical studies have noted gaps and variability in knowledge and skills among new interns. These gaps have prompted medical educators to turn their attention to the fourth year of medical school in an effort to strengthen students' preparedness for internship. Among the wide array of fourth-year courses, the subinternship (also known as acting internship) is commonly viewed as one of the most important clinical experiences in helping senior medical students prepare for internship. This view has been shared by both faculty and residents. The origin of the subinternship can be traced back to World War II, a time when the national shortage of interns necessitated the creation of \"acting internships\" for senior medical students. Seen as a logical extension of the \"progressive graded responsibility\" concept already in place for residency programs, this new rotation for senior medical students became widely adopted after the war. Over time, this popular course has evolved into an integral component of undergraduate medical training and is now required at 90% of U.S. allopathic medical schools. Despite its longstanding tenure, medical educators have only begun to establish some standardized structure and content for the subinternship in the past two decades. In 1998, Fagan and colleagues began this process by outlining specific recommendations for the internal medicine (IM) subinternship's structure and experience. In 2002, the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) Subinternship Task Force developed a core curriculum for the IM subinternship. This curriculum was based upon a needs assessment survey of IM residency program directors, subinternship directors, and interns. The landscape of graduate medical education (GME) and medical practice has changed significantly since the turn of this century, prompting national organizations to call for reforms to the medical school curriculum so that medical students are more adequately prepared for post-graduate training. The Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) surveyed its members in 2010 and put forth four core skills all IM interns should possess at the start of residency training. Soon thereafter, the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine (AAIM) formed a joint CDIM-APDIM Committee on Transition to Internship (CACTI) to examine the fourth year of medical school with the aim of making evidence-based recommendations to help students optimize their preparation for internship. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) also established thirteen core entrustable professional activities for entering residency (EPA) that define a set of foundational skills and behaviors expected of all medical school graduates. The core EPAs were created as a practical approach to assess the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) six core competencies in real-world settings. Over this same time period the medical education community became increasingly aware of the distress and burnout problem among residents and medical students, resulting in calls for interventions to improve medical students' well-being and resilience in hopes of getting them better prepared for their next phase of clinical training. Objectives: To become familiar with and graded upon the 13 Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) throughout the subinternship. 1. To gather a history and perform a physical examination. 2. To prioritize a differential diagnosis following a clinical encounter. 3. To recommend and interpret common diagnostic and screening tests. 4. To enter and discuss orders and prescriptions. 5. To document a clinical encounter in the patient record. 6. To provide an oral presentation of a clinical encounter. 7. To form clinical questions and retrieve evidence to advance patient care. 8. To give or receive a patient handover to transition care responsibility. 9. To collaborate as a member of an interprofessional team. 10. To recognize a patient requiring urgent or emergent care and initiate evaluation and management. 11. To obtain informed consent for tests and/or procedures. 12. To perform general procedures of a physician. 13. To identify system failures and contribute to a culture of safety and improvement. Methods: Hospital-based clinical training with supervision from both senior residents and hospitalists/preceptors. Complimented by hospital-based didactics including case conferences, morning reports, and grand rounds. Recommended Reading/Resources: The Subinternship Curriculum Version 2.0 along with online material as needed/directed based on the patient population.

Category - Subinternship Recommended Attire: professional, white coat, scrubs when on call EMR System: EPIC 8470 - Internal Medicine Subinternship - Harper Hospital Course Prerequisites: Must be an M4 student in good standing who has completed a 3rd year clerkship in Internal Medicine. Description: Students will expand on their Year 3 internal medicine clerkship experience with more intensive involvement in patients experiencing common internal medicine ailments in the hospital setting. Rationale: While the time period between medical school graduation and the start of graduate medical training (internship) may be short, the transformation from medical student to intern is a significant one. New interns are expected to assume higher levels of responsibility and workload in the setting of challenging clinical, social, and emotional contexts. Surveys of residency program directors and empirical studies have noted gaps and variability in knowledge and skills among new interns. These gaps have prompted medical educators to turn their attention to the fourth year of medical school in an effort to strengthen students' preparedness for internship. Among the wide array of fourth-year courses, the subinternship (also known as acting internship) is commonly viewed as one of the most important clinical experiences in helping senior medical students prepare for internship. This view has been shared by both faculty and residents. The origin of the subinternship can be traced back to World War II, a time when the national shortage of interns necessitated the creation of \"acting internships\" for senior medical students. Seen as a logical extension of the \"progressive graded responsibility\" concept already in place for residency programs, this new rotation for senior medical students became widely adopted after the war. Over time, this popular course has evolved into an integral component of undergraduate medical training and is now required at 90% of U.S. allopathic medical schools. Despite its longstanding tenure, medical educators have only begun to establish some standardized structure and content for the subinternship in the past two decades. In 1998, Fagan and colleagues began this process by outlining specific recommendations for the internal medicine (IM) subinternship's structure and experience. In 2002, the Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) Subinternship Task Force developed a core curriculum for the IM subinternship. This curriculum was based upon a needs assessment survey of IM residency program directors, subinternship directors, and interns. The landscape of graduate medical education (GME) and medical practice has changed significantly since the turn of this century, prompting national organizations to call for reforms to the medical school curriculum so that medical students are more adequately prepared for post-graduate training. The Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) surveyed its members in 2010 and put forth four core skills all IM interns should possess at the start of residency training. Soon thereafter, the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine (AAIM) formed a joint CDIM-APDIM Committee on Transition to Internship (CACTI) to examine the fourth year of medical school with the aim of making evidence-based recommendations to help students optimize their preparation for internship. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) also established thirteen core entrustable professional activities for entering residency (EPA) that define a set of foundational skills and behaviors expected of all medical school graduates. The core EPAs were created as a practical approach to assess the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) six core competencies in real-world settings. Over this same time period the medical education community became increasingly aware of the distress and burnout problem among residents and medical students, resulting in calls for interventions to improve medical students' well-being and resilience in hopes of getting them better prepared for their next phase of clinical training. Objectives: To become familiar with and graded upon the 13 Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) throughout the subinternship. 1. To gather a history and perform a physical examination. 2.

Methods: Students will first be given a tour of the office. Then, students can expect to be very hands on in their patient care. Students will always see oncology patients on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Students will review the chart and go into the room as a first encounter before the attending physician to examine the patient with a total H&P, history, medication review, etc. and share their impressions with the physician in the hallways. Students and the physician will have a discussion, and then students will follow the physician into the room to see the same patient. They will then have a repeated discussion to ensure students understand the care plan and students will document the patient interaction with their notes. Students can expect to do hematology care on Tuesdays and Wednesdays following the same process. On Monday mornings, students will watch bone marrows. There will be private lectures called \"coffee lectures\" two days a week. If a physician has an interesting case, students will always be asked to join the case to get greater experience on the subject. Students can expect to see an average of 5-10 new patients each day. Students can expect to see a large volume of patients very quickly, while still giving each patient the time they need to ask questions, get answers to every problem/question, and feel like they've been given complete care.

The purpose is to have the student perform, within limits and under strict supervision, the duties of a PGY1 resident on an inpatient service. This includes day to day care of inpatients and some outpatient experience as would be performed by the first year residents. The student would be an integral part of an inpatient team of senior, junior residents and yr 3 medical students. They are assigned primary patients and are assigned duties and responsibilities above what were expected of M3 clerkship students. Evaluation is done by residents and faculty and involves feedback based on EPA readiness. The subinternship is also somewhat specialty specific in resident preparation, but has expected EPA tasks that are common to all specialties. The student Subintern will be assigned to an inpatient/outpatient core obstetrics gynecology service at affiliated hospitals identified at the beginning of the registration process. The subinterns are expected to be capable of providing billable documentation per the limits of MMS federal guidance of 2018, as allowed by institutional and physician policy (this is being piloted for our subI students at one institution as of 2018-19 academic year). Objectives: - Taking on primary responsibility for the patient. - Focusing histories, physicals, and oral and written communication appropriately. - Sharing information effectively with a patient and family. - Prioritizing and organizing work effectively. - Anticipating what a patient will need during the course of hospitalization (i.e. when they need to be reexamined, when a lab needs to be repeated, when additional therapy is necessary, when additional history needs to be obtained, discharge criteria) and communicating this information effectively in handovers. - Re-evaluating a patient when you take on their care (i.e. the assessment and plan, as well as the clinical status) and looking further when the clinical picture does not fit. - Continuing to think about and re-assess the patient during the course of the day. - Coping with uncertainty in patient care issues (i.e. knowing what you know and what you don't know, accessing best resources, and knowing when and how to get help). - Functioning as a \"team player\" with residents, attendings, nurses, ancillary staff and all others involved in the care of the patient. - Coordinating the care of your patient during hospitalization and in planning for discharge. Methods: Students will provide patient care that is compassionate, appropriate and effective with attention to the patients' perspectives, needs, values and comfort.

Methods: The Peds Sub-I is available every month for a limited number of students. Students are assigned to a pediatric in-patient service team, either on one of the general inpatient teams, an inpatient specialty team or one of the critical care units. Each team consists of an Attending Physician, 1-2 Senior Residents, interns, and third-year students. The sub-intern's level of responsibility is on par with a PL-1 resident and as such involves direct patient care responsibility for hospitalized children. Under the supervision of pediatric senior residents and pediatric attendings, students learn by doing and by example. As a functioning member of the inpatient team, sub-interns participate in all ward rounds, direct patient care, documentation, procedures, consultations, clinical planning and didactic conferences. On call responsibilities during the sub-internship are the same as that of the pediatric interns on their respective teams, either a combination of short, long and night shifts or a standard overnight call. Sub-intern schedules adhere to the ACGME duty hour requirements. As this is an intensive, full-time commitment to patient care as an integral member of the inpatient team, this experience is not to be interrupted by vacations, residency interviews, or unexcused absences. The sub-internship begins with an orientation in the afternoon of the first day to review the expectations of the rotation. Sub-interns will also meet with the Associate Clerkship Director and/or the chief residents midway through the month, and finally have an exit interview on the last day. They are expected to attend the educational sessions along with the pediatric residents and may have some informal teaching sessions with their teams or the sub-intern faculty.
