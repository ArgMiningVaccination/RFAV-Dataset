The r oots of organic agricultur e Ther e was a time in the not-so-distant past when all agricultur e was or ganic. Since the disco very, development, and availability of antibiotics, pesticides, and f ertilizers in the 1940s, these new materials/r esour ces became commonplace in agricultur e and liv estock pr oduction. American or ganic farming has r oots in the humus-farming movement of the 1920s-1950s. Humus is the dark, or ganic material that forms in soil when plant and animal matter deca ys without the assistance of commer cial synthetic f ertilizers or pesticides. This occurs in farms that include livestock, food cr ops, f eed cr ops, and gr een manur es. (Coff ey and Baier 2012). The 1960s thr ough the 1980s saw the gr owth of or ganic agricultur e as public concern o ver pesticides gr ew. During this time, thir d-par ty or ganic cer tifiers carried out independent assessments t o verify compliance but had an inconsistent set of standar ds. This changed in 1990 when the U.S. Congr ess passed the Or ganic F oods Pr oduction Act. Then, in 1992, the National Or ganic Pr ogram (NOP), a USD A feder al regulat ory program that de velops and enfor ces national standar ds for or ganic agricultur al pr oducts sold in the U.S., was established. The y also cr eated an advisor y boar d - the National Or ganic Standar ds Boar d (NOSB), which mak es recommendations t o the NOP on new regulations and standar ds. In 2002 the NOP star ted t o accr edit cer tifiers. USD A's National Or ganic Pr (NOP) The NOP o versees the pr oduction standar ds. It also maintains the National List of Allowed and Pr ohibited Substances, which specifies appr oved synthetic substances that ma y be used in or ganic pr oduction and natur al substances that ma y not be used (7 CFR 205.603). National Or ganic S tandar ds Boar d (NOSB) A 15-member boar d that mak es recommendations t o the NOP about materials and pr actices that ma y be used in organic pr oduction. The boar d meets twice a y ear t o hear public comments, continually e valuating and impr oving the standar ds as new materials become a vailable and new information comes t o light. The NOSB includes farmers, pr ocessors, r etailers, envir onmentalists, scientists, consumers, and r epresentativ es of cer tification agencies. Organic c ertifica tion agencies The USD A accr edits cer tification agencies t o act on its behalf t o ensur e that farms and pr ocessing facilities ar e complying with or ganic r egulations. These agencies ha ve the power t o grant or r evoke organic cer tification. Farmers can choose a cer tification agency based on a number of fact ors. In addition t o determining cer tification status, the agency k eeps the farmer/pr ocessor updated about changes t o regulations. Organic inspect ors Trained individuals who visit farms t o audit r ecor ds, inspect fields and facilities and v erify pr oducers and processors ar e following NOP rules. The y do not gr ant or r evoke cer tification. The y provide the information t o the certification agency , which decides. Inspect ors who ar e inspecting cer tified or ganic oper ations ar e not allowed t o recommend farming pr actices or pr oducts (This ma y be in contr ast with inspect ors for alternativ e cer tifications who can giv e insight t o the farmers being inspected). 2 | The r oots of or ganic Organic agricultur e is based on the principle of sustainability - meeting curr ent needs without jeopar dizing the ability of futur e gener ations t o meet their needs (Coff ey and Baier 2012). The National Or ganic Pr ogram (NOP) and the National Or ganic Standar ds Boar d (NOSB) define or ganic agricultur e as a production systems appr oach that seeks t o understand how all the par ts of the system work t ogether . Organic farmers consider how soil, water , plants, animals, insects, bacteria, fungi, and all other par ts of the system inter act t o promote pr oduction and wholesome food pr oducts. Or ganic/alternativ use of liv estock that ar e adapted t o the farm 's climate), Biological (e.g., maintaining a dense pastur e to prevent weed gr owth and r otational gr azing with multiple species t o reduce internal par asite pr oblems), and Mechanical (e.g., clipping weeds befor e the y can go t o seed in pastur e). Organic agricultur e is based on the principle of sustainability - meeting curr ent needs without jeopar dizing the ability of futur e gener ations t meet their needs (Coff ey and Baier 2012). Accor ding t o the NOP , organic food must be pr oduced without using entional pesticides, petr oleum-based fertilizers, sewage sludge-based f ertilizers, herbicides, genetic engineering antibiotics, gr owth hormones, or irr adiation. (CFR an ation must meet animal health and welfar e standar ds, not be f ed antibiotics or gr owth hormones, be f ed 100-per cent or ganic f eed, and be pr ovided access t o the outdoors (Coff ee and Baier 2012) (CF205.236 thr ough 205.240). The USD A oversees the NOP b y certification of farmers who wish t o become cer tified or ganic and carr y the or ganic label. The y establish a list of allowed and pr ohibited substances used in or ganic liv estock, accr edit the cer tifiers, r organic pr ocessing of carcasses, r ecor d-keeping, and r egular r e-cer tification. It is a land r equir ement t o ha ve no pr ohibited substances applied for 3 y ears pr eceding the har vest of a cr op Code of F eder al Regulation-National Or ganic Pr ogram. It is a 3-y ear pr ocess for a farm t o become cer tified organic. During that time, farmers who cannot sell as organic ar e called \"tr ansitional\" (Coff ey and Baier 2012). Howe ver, some land ma y be eligible for or ganic certification right awa y. This would include Conser vation Reser ve Program (CRP) gr ound or ha y/grass that has had no pr ohibited inputs. W e will go int o mor e detail about the cer tification pr ocess in the coming chapters. What is or ganic/alternativ e livestock? | 3Wha t do w e mean b y organic/alt erna tive livestock? When we sa y cer tified or ganic, we ar e talking about those farms cer tified b y the USD A to carr y the or ganic label described abo ve. All other labels or claims that include the use or non-use of antibiotics, pesticides, and GMOs will be designated in these pages as \" alternativ e\". The term \" alternativ e\" also includes farms that ma y not seek USD A organic cer tification due t o the hea vy regulation and requir ements t o become cer tified but ma y, in fact, pr actice non-use of antibiotics, pesticides, etc. F arms that ar e in the pr ocess of USD A organic cer tification but ar e not y et certified ar e called \"tr ansitional\" and, for our purposes, ar e included under the term \" alternativ e.\" Together we will call these gr oups of pr oducers or ganic/alternativ e (O/A). 4 | What is or ganic/alternativ e livestock?4.

If we look solely at liv estock and liv estock pr oducts, the gr owth has been equally str ong. This, in lar ge par t, can be attributed t o consumer demand and matches the tr ends seen in the previously discussed data.

Organic and alt erna tive certifica tion How can y ou recogniz e organic and alternativ ely raised pr oducts? Due t o the gr eat v ariety of options and v arying levels of o versight, it' s not as easy as one might think! Some pr ograms ha ve cer tification thr ough thir d-par ty cer tifiers (e.g., USD A certified or ganic, American Gr assf ed Association (A GA) and some pr ograms combine or ganic or alternativ e claims and welfar e claims. (e.g., Global Animal P artnership (GAP)), and some mak e label claims with no mention of \" certification \" (e.g., natur al, fr ee-range, sustainable, etc.). Certification implies that someone, either a 3r d par ty with no affiliation t o the company/pr oduct or someone within the company , is o verseeing the pr actices and ensuring compliance with the rules laid out b y the or ganization. W e'll provide mor e information on these options in the following section, star ting with 3r d par ty cer tification pr ograms. One goal for most of the v arious cer tification pr ograms is t o provide pr oducers a mark eting adv antage with consumers. USD A organic c ertifica tion USD A organic cer tification is accomplished thr ough an independent 3r d par ty certification pr ocess. Certifying agents ar e accr edited b y the USD A and ensur e USD A organic pr oducts meet all or ganic standar ds. Most USD A-accr edited cer tifying agencies ar e allowed t o cer tify farms and businesses anywher e in the world. F armers, ranchers, and pr ocessors ma y work with any USDA-accr edited cer tifying agency . To become a USD A cer tified or ganic pr oducer: 1. Submit an application and an Or ganic System Plan (OSP) detailing how the oper ation will comply with the r egulations. 2. Have an inspection. If the plan looks compliant, the cer tification agency will send an inspect or to verify that the farm 's practices match the plan. The or ganic inspect or will r eview all r ecor ds and the or ganic system plan, visit every field, and look at the equipment, st orage, and liv estock facilities. 3. After visiting the farm, the inspect or will submit a r epor t verifying that the pr oducer follows the plan t o the certification agency . The agency ma y call or write with r equests for information. 4. The cer tifying agency will send a determination letter t o the farmer . If appr oved, the oper ation is issued an Organic Cer tificate. 5. Producers can then apply for a vailable cer tification cost-shar e rebates. Annual r eview , recor d keeping, and inspection ar e requir ed to maintain or ganic status. Mor e information can be found here: Guidebook for Or ganic Cer tification- Marbleseed. The cost of USD A organic cer tification v aries widely and depends on se veral fact ors, including the cer tifying agency , the siz e and scope of the oper ation, and the state in which the farm or r anch is located. Pr ocessing facilities ar e also requir ed to be cer tified. The USD A mak es an ex ception fr om cer tification for farmers who sell less than $5,000 a y ear in or ganic foods. These producers must follow the guidelines for or ganic food pr oduction, but the y do not ha ve to go thr ough the cer tification process. The y can label their pr oducts as or ganic, but the y ma y not use the official USD A Or ganic seal. These products cannot go int o processed pr oducts (i.e., gr owing str awberries for USD A cer tified or ganic str awberr y jam). Organic and alternativ e cer tification | 7Animal pr oducts originating outside of the U.S. can be sold in the U.S. as cer tified or ganic if the y are cer tified or ganic by USD A organic r egulations or an authoriz ed international standar d and ha ve trade agr eements with the US. Curr ently , the U.S. has or ganic tr ade arr angements with Canada, the E uropean Union, Japan, the Republic of K orea, and Switz erland. Mor e information on impor ted or ganic pr oducts can be found in the USD A factsheet: Impor ting Organic Pr oducts Int o the US . American Gr assfed A ssocia tion (A GA) Another d-par ty cer tification pr ogram is a vailable and administer ed b y the AGA for beef cattle, dair y, and swine. The pr ogram's standar ds requir e continuous access t o pastur e and a diet of 100 per cent for age. Confinement t o feedlots and the use of hormones and antibiotics ar e prohibited. Ill or injur ed animals are tr eated but must be taken out of the pr ogram. Independent A GA-appr oved inspect ors conduct farm/r anch inspections. Dair y inspect ors must complete an online course off ered b y the International Or ganic Inspect ors Association (IOI A). Additionally , any v eterinarian with a pr actice that includes the inspected species ma y become an A GA inspect or. Once inspections ar e completed, the r epor t is submitted t o the cer tification committee. Ther e is an annual f ee for pr oducers, and r einspection occurs e very 12-15 months. Only American-r aised animals can be cer tified b y the A GA. Alterna tive livestock c ertifica tion pr ograms tha t include humane practic es This description includes liv estock pr oducers who ma y not use antibiotics, GMOs , or pesticides but ar e not cer tified organic. It ma y also include animal welfar e-related designations and cer tifications. This gr oup of pr oducers is much harder t o define, measur e, understand, and compar e. Some examples include GAP , Whole F oods' humane labeling program, American Humane Cer tified, Animal W elfar e Appr oved, and Cer tified Humane. F or pr oducers desiring t o become cer tified b y these or ganizations, etc., ther e is clearly a place for v eterinarians and animal health professionals t o contribute/consult/advise t o help these pr oducers accomplish their cer tification goals. Non-c ertified labels/claims For a pr oduct t o carr y the or ganic label, the pr oduction pr ocess must be cer tified or ganic fr om star t to finish t o ensur e that or ganic r equir ements ar e met. Howe ver, companies put many other labels or claims on their food for mark eting purposes unr elated t o any cer tification pr ogram. Meat, eggs, and milk pr oducts can also be labeled as gr ass-f ed, 100% gr ass-f ed, aised antibiotics, or r aised without pesticides or r aised without added hormones or as non- GMO . Ther e is a dizzying array of designations that independent v erification does not substantiate. 8 | Organic and alternativ e cer tification6. Organic and alt erna tive produc ers - who the y are and why the y do it Getting t o know y our farming community and potential new clients is impor tant if y ou ar e new t o organic and alternativ e agricultur e.

W e found that ganic and alternativ e farmers: aised 2-3 species - 30% r aised 4 or mor e species. Species included beef, poultr y, swine, sheep, dair y, goats, r abbits, bees, bison, y ak, and fish. The big pictur e is that r aising or ganic or alternativ e livestock is based on human, animal, and ecosystem health/ welfar e concerns. O/A farmers belie ve that non-use of cer tain pr oducts on the land, their animals, and cr ops dir ectly and positiv ely aff ects their health, their animals, and the envir onment. E conomics is also impor tant. F armers can 't stay in business if the y don 't mak e a living and ha ve the ability t o suppor t their families. So, the incr eased income from selling an or ganic or alternativ ely raised pr oduct is also a motiv ating fact or. In gener al, O/A pr oducers ar e not one-siz e-fits-all. Howe ver, like all farmers, these farmers ar e har dworking, busy , and passionate about their families and their work.

The activ e role of v eterinarians on O/A livestock oper ations is well laid out b y the USD A in the Guide for Or ganic Livestock Pr oducers (Coff ee and Baier 2012). Despite its age, (2012) the USD A Guide for Or ganic Pr oducers provides timeless written guidance for or ganic liv estock pr oducers, including information on par v eterinarians on their oper ations. The hist ory of v eterinar y use and the willingness of O/A pr oducers and v eterinarians t o work together has been complicated. Let' s explor e this mor e. \"I've said for a long time that most of what I tr eat as a food animal v et comes fr om err ors in husbandr y and management, stewar dship, and st ockmanship. Until we ar e really willing t o change that, it seems lik e ther e will be a lot of tail-chasing. \" (Livestock v eterinarian) The v eterinary perspectiv e Gener ally, veterinarians ha ve mix ed feelings about their ability t o meet or ganic pr oducer needs and belie ve the y lack knowledge of or ganic guidelines and health tr eatments (O'Neill and W ells 2013; Sor ge, Y amashita, et al. 2019). In a 2013 sur vey of Iowa v eterinarians and or ganic liv estock pr oducers, less than 1% of v eterinarians said the y receiv ed instruction in or ganic liv estock during v eterinar y school and agr eed the y need mor e information (O'Neill and W ells 2013). These deficiencies appear t o be univ ersal acr oss v eterinar y education systems. It is difficult t o find the time and space t o include mor e courses in the alr eady jam-pack ed veterinar y curriculum. Curr ently , if the y are inter ested, students would lik ely ha ve to find that information thr ough internships and externships during their senior y ear, reading up on the subject, and continuing education (CE) courses such as this. When ask ed about the a vailability of O/A farming information, v eterinarians said curr ent (2013) information was scar ce, that the y relied on the internet for sour ces of information on or ganic liv estock, and suggested seminars and conf erences as tr aining options. Most veterinarians sur veyed (72%) said the y would attend an educational e vent ( CE) related t o organic liv estock. (O'Neill 2013). These deficiencies and suggestions highlight the need and desir e for mor e educational r esour ces on O/A farming and the v eterinarian 's role (O'Neill and W ells 2013). \"We need v ets who ha ve cultur al awar eness of the plain community \". (Dair y veterinarian with conv entional and organic clients). When looking at specific species, a sur vey of bo vine pr actitioners in 2019 found mor e than half of them thought organic rules wer e difficult t o follow and that the y lack ed knowledge about or ganic r egulations. As a r esult, these difficulties inhibit them fr om including or ganic and alternativ e farmers in their pr actices. Howe ver, when these r esults were str atified b y practitioners who had or ganic clients and those that didn 't, veterinarians with or ganic clients wer e more likely to ha ve positiv e responses r egar ding the ease of use of or ganic r egulations and wer e less lik ely to agr ee that or ganic pr oducers would not use v eterinar y advice. In this study , experience working with O/A clients pr ovided a The r ole of the v eterinarian on or ganic/alternativ e oper ations | e. Combined with the obser vations fr om the 2013 O'Neill study r egar ding gaps in perception, knowledge, and communication among individuals in or ganic liv estock systems (v eterinarians and producers), these r esults indicate that positiv e working r elationships between these gr oups ar e possible. How can mutual understanding and positiv e relationships best be de veloped between or ganic liv estock pr oducers and veterinarians? (The studies cited abo ve relate t o organic dairies vs. conv entional dair y oper resear ch regar ding O/A beef, sheep, goat, poultr y, or egg oper ations hasn 't been r epor ted and is less clear). \"Veterinarians need t o be willing t o de velop a VCPR with or ganic and alternativ Veterinarian with conv pr oduc er's perspectiv e \"It is r eally helpful t o ha ve a v et who is knowledgeable about or ganics and the standar ds.

Despite USD A recommendations, studies ha ve shown that O/A liv estock pr oducers often do not use v as fr equently as their conv entional counterpar ts and instead seek animal health advice from other sour ces or handle pr oblems independently (O'Neill and W ells 2013). These pr oducers ar e mor e likely to rely on past experience, other pr oducers, wor d of mouth, books, or ganic workshops, field da ys, and the Internet when dealing with common pr oblems (O'Neill and W ells 2013; Rick ert 2013). O/A liv estock pr oducers do not see the need t o consult a v eterinarian for se veral reasons. Commonly r epor ted r easons ar e the y feel that their liv estock ar e healthier than conv entional liv estock, the y per ceive a negativ mindset of some v eterinarians towar d organic agricultur e, or the y belie ve veterinarians do not ha ve the appr opriate knowledge of or ganic r egulations and allowable substances (Sor ge, Y amashita, et al. 2019). \"The or ganic industr y is what sa ved the dair y business in my ar ea, so we ar e lucky in the fact that all the v ets now r ealiz e it helped sa ve their pr actices as well\". Or ganic/alternativ e livestock pr Sur Iowa State Univ ersity . Howe ver, the decr eased use of v eterinarians on O/A farms is not clear-cut. One study of 292 or ganic and conv entional dair y farms in New Y ork, Or egon, and Wisconsin found that v eterinar y usage was mor e closely associated with intensiv eness of management pr actices (i.e., pr egnancy checking, use of a nutritionist, use of AI for breeding) than whether a farm was classified as or ganic or conv entional. O/A oper intensiv e oper ations, so their lack of use of v eterinar y ser vices is not surprising in this r egar d. The per ception is that organic liv estock pr oducers ar e averse t o using v eterinar y ser vices. But in fact, it ma y be at least in par t, that producers just don 't need them in the tr aditional-conv entional dair y practitioner sense.

Liv estock tr eated with a prohibited substance must then be clearly identified and cannot be sold, labeled, or r epresented as or ganically pr oduced\" (7 CFR 205.238(c)(7), USD A NOP). This is wher e much of the challenge t o veterinarians and pr oducers comes in. The loss of organic status for an animal is v ery serious (especially on small farms that do not ha ve ready r eplacements) and can lead t o waiting t oo long t o treat with conv entional ther apies. Animals that lose or ganic status because the y have been given a pr ohibited substance must be r ecor ded. The cer tifying agency is notified. The animal must be clearly mark ed, separ ated fr om the pr oduction string, and sold/r emo ved once the withdr awal times ha ve passed.

This might be y our first intr oduction t o some of these tr eatments, or y ou and y our family ma y already use them as the y are included in the arsenal of human medicine as well. Some of these pr oducts/tr eatments work better than others (similar t o conv entional medicines). The use of some of these pr oducts goes back hundr eds of years, e.g., the use of botanicals, homeopathy , and acupunctur e. As such, the y might be the pr ecursors of pharmaceuticals used curr ently on conv entional farms (especially botanicals). Alternativ e treatments ha ve varying levels of e vidence-based scientific v alidation.

Practicing medicine on O/A oper ations | 27Botanicals Botanicals ar e one of the oldest known medicines. Botanicals ar e the actual plant that can be ingested or ally, used in a poultice, or br ewed in a tea. The y can be pr epar ed as tinctur es, essential oils, gly cerites, syrups, decoctions, and dried extr acts. New botanicals ar e being constantly de veloped for use (P adgham 2006). Essential oils ha ve been used since the Middle Ages for their antiseptic (bactericidal, virucidal), fungicidal, antipar asitic, and insecticidal ha ve medicinal analgesic, sedativ e, anti-inflammat ory, spasmolytic, and local anesthetic pr oper ties. The y have been used for food pr eser vation and e ven embalmment. Most essential oils ar e extr acted b y distillation fr om ar omatic plants. The char acteristics of essential oils r emain unchanged, howe ver mor e is pr esently known about their mechanisms of action. In natur e, essential oils pr otect plants fr om bacteria, viruses, etc., and also pr otect them fr om herbiv ores by making them less palatable. The y also attract insects that help disperse pollen and seeds and r epel others that might be undesir able. Essential oils ar e complex mixtur es of molecules and, when combined, can ha ve syner gistic eff ects. Essential oils ar e usually applied topically (Baakkali 2008). In animals, essential oils ar e often used as liniments for tr eating foot pr oblems (P adgham 2006). s impor tant t o use 100% ther apeutic-gr ade essential oils.

The alcohol of gly cerin absorbs beneficial molecules that ha ve medicinal pr oper ties in a concentr ated form. Garlic tinctur e is commonly used as an antibacterial. Goldenseal and St. John 's Wort act as analgesics, comfr ey heals bones, and arnica pr events bruising (Padgham 2006). Probio tics and Pr ebio tics The normal micr oscopic bacteria in the G.I. tract mak e up the gut micr obiome. A healthy micr obiome supplies nutrients t o the host, aids in digestion, and helps with food conv ersion. Antibiotic use is not the only thing that affects the health of gut micr obes. Illness, injur y, and str ess can alter the normal bacterial population, pH, and digestiv e processes and contribute t o fur ther ill health and dela yed healing (Shoen and Wynn 1998). Pr obiotics ar e living micr obes that add good bacteria t o the gut micr obiome. Pr e-biotics ar e not living or ganisms but ar e food for those gut micr obes and help them multiply . Homeopa thy Homeopathy is a medical system based on the idea that the body can heal itself. Tiny amounts of natur al substances, lik e plants or miner als, stimulate the healing pr ocess. Homeopathy was de veloped in Germany in the 1700s and is mor e common in E urope than in the U.S. The pr emise behind homeopathy is that lik e cur es lik e. Thus, something that brings on sympt oms in a healthy animal or person can tr eat an illness with similar sympt oms when used in v ery small doses.

Acupunctur e Acupunctur e is an ancient form of medicine that encour ages the body t o heal itself. Fine, sterile needles ar e inser ted through the skin and underlying tissues at specific locations, called points. Acupunctur e stimulates the body t o produce neur ochemicals. Micr otrauma occurs when the needle is placed int o the tissue in a specific spot and stimulates a healing cascade thr ough v essels and ner This activ ates cells that tr avel thr ough the spinal cor d, releasing healing fact ors and activ ating pain-blocking mechanisms. It also r eleases endorphins and hormonal chemicals. Acupr essur e can also be used b y applying digital pr essur e to an acupunctur e point. Acupunctur e has been used in beef cattle for r eproductiv e issues (poor libido, decr eased sperm pr oduction) and in beef cows for inf ertility and pr olapse. Injuries, lameness, and wound healing ar e also common tr eatments. Acupunctur e often r equir es se veral visits t o see an eff ect.

Check out Beef Acupunctur e Magazine for mor e. Chiropractic Chiropractic car e is a complementar y appr oach t o treatment and healing with the goal of assisting the body in healing itself. Chir opractic modalities ha ve this in common with acupunctur e and many of the other complementar y treatments that ha ve been used for centuries. Hippocr ates pr acticed spinal manipulation and is often quoted b y chir opractors as sa ying, \"look well t o the spine for causes of disease \" (Wardell 1992). Chiropractic is one of the most commonly used forms of alternativ e treatment in humans and has gained popularity in animals since the early 20th centur y (Shoen and Wynn 1998). The focus of chir opractic car e is on the r elationship of the spinal column t o the ner vous system and the r ole of the spinal column in biomechanics and mo vement. The basis of chir opractic is the subluxation which can be described as the decr eased motion of the joints b y slight changes in the position of the ar ticulating facets that r esult in abnormal biomechanical includes compr ession of spinal ner ve roots or spinal cor d, vertebrobasilar arterial insufficiency , somat (Shoen 2001). Chir opractic treatments attempt t o restore normal position and movement of joints. V eterinar y chir opractic r esear ch is limited. Howe ver, chir opractic car e for animals has commonly been used for athletes (horses, dogs) as well as tr auma, post oper ative complications, ex cess weight, and conformation issues (all species, including liv estock) or entional clients are passionate about animal, envir onmental, and human health and acknowledge that this includes v eterinar y care. Howe ver, many of the encounters with veterinarians and others outside of their or ganic or non-conv entional communities ha ve left O/A producers feeling mar ginaliz ed, misunderst ood, and o verlook ed. This situation pr esents an oppor tunity for gr owth for any practice looking t o expand and work with these clients. Bridging this gap centers hea vily on eff ectiv e communication. F ortunately , communication is a skill that can be impr oved with e valuation and pr actice. The first step in expanding business t o include non-conv entional clients is t o be open t o diff erent ideas. If y ou ar e not willing t o consider alternativ e wa ys of doing things, it will be difficult t o get and k eep clients who pr actice alternativ e types of farming. W orking with O/A farmers will r equir e some r esear ch, cr eativity , and outside-the-bo x thinking. Because the y work with v arious species and diff erent kinds of clients, v eterinarians ar e alr eady skilled in this ar ea. Expanding y our skills t o include and working with non-conv entional clients r equir es building on these foundational skills. Rising t o this challenge can help foster pr oductiv e, fulfilling, and lasting r elationships with mor e clients. After r ecognizing it' s possible t o do things diff erently , the next step is t o learn about diff erent options. Which y ou ar e already doing b y taking the initiativ e and signing up for this course. Howe ver, beyond the information pr ovided in this continuing education course, be willing t o learn b y doing y our own r esear ch and learning fr om y our O/A clients. Many have been living and farming with an or ganic or non-conv entional philosophy for decades. Their knowledge fr om their experiences can be a gr eat sour ce of useful information in pr acticing in the or ganic and alternativ e livestock r ealm. This does not mean the y will know e verything, but the y will be mor e receptiv e to your r ecommendations if y ou tak e the time t o listen t o theirs. Opening up t o them will not be per ceived as a weakness or lacking as a pr ofessional, but as a collabor ation working t owar ds mutual goals. This type of inter action between v eterinarian and client builds mor e productiv e and long-lasting ofessional with div gr oups is essential for any successful v eterinarian. As y ou ha ve likely experienced, veterinarians work with people who ha ve various le vels of education, experience, beliefs, pr eferences, and mor e due to the div erse communities that the y ser ve. In most ar eas, O/A producers ar e a minority . Little t o no v eterinar y school education has been giv en to their needs and r equir ements for maintaining animal health. As a r esult, communicating effectiv ely with this gr oup is of the utmost impor tance. E ffectiv e communication str ategies can help ensur e the best possible outcomes for all clients and animals inv olved. This skill has been shown t o promote positiv e relationships, increase client satisfaction, adher ence t o recommendations, and incr eased job satisfaction for the pr ovider (Shaw , Adams, et al. 2004, Jank e, Coe, et al. 2021). Ultimately , this will impr ove animal outcomes and quality of lif e. 30 | Practice management and communication skills developmentCommunication is a skill that can alwa ys be impr oved with e valuation and pr actice.

It incr eases job satisfaction o verall. Who doesn 't want t o be happier at work? Impr oving y our ability t o communicate with non-conv entional clients enables business expansion int o this r ealm. In addition, it is a skill that can be applied both pr ofessionally , with clients and co-work ers, and personally in r elationships outside of work and at home. Impr oving this skill is not only an inv estment in your work-lif e. It is an inv estment for y our whole lif e.
