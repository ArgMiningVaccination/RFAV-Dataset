Program Funding Opportunity Description 1. Purpose This notice announces the opportunity for HRSA -funded health centers to apply for FY 2022 Accelerating Cancer Screening (AxCS) funding. AxCS funding will support health centers to increase equitable access to cancer screening and referral for care and treatment 1 by enhancing patient education, case management, outreach, and other enabling services, in close partnership or coordination with National Cancer Institute (NCI) -designated Cancer Centers that will deploy outreach specialists and patient navigators for populations served by health centers . For more details, see Program Requirements and Expectations . 2. Background The Health Center Program is authorized by the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) \u00a7 330 (42 US C \u00a7 254b) . For the purpose of this NOFO, health centers are defined as those receiving Health Center Program operational funding under sections 330(e), (g), (h) and/or (i), otherwise referred to as H80 funding. AxCS funding will be awarded to health centers under the same subsection(s) of section 330 as their H80 award. AxCS funding is being made available through the Alcee L. Hastings Pr ogram for Advanced Cancer Screening in Underserved Communities. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, with nearly 600,000 deaths annually.2 In 2021, there were an estimated 281,550 breast cancer s and 14,480 cervical cancer s diagnosed in women3 and 149,500 colorectal cancers diagnosed in men and women.4 Breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer can be prevented or detected early through appropriate screening and timely follow -up care of an abnormal cancer screening test result. Yet, disparities in screening and follow -up care after an abnormal cancer screening test result persist by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and health care access.5 Disruptions in cancer care during the COVID -19 pandemic resulted in 1 For the purpose of this NOFO, referral for care and treatment is defined as assisting patients with accessing appropriate follow -up care (e.g., diagnostic services, therapies, clinical trials) within 3 0 days of receiving an abnormal screening test result . 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Accessed , cervical, and colorectal cancer screening.6 Disparities in cancer care were exacerbated during the pandemic in communities less likely to use telehealth.7 Health centers are a key point of entry to screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. In 2020, over 1.4 million female health center patients had a mammogram to screen for breast cancer, and over 3.8 million health center patients were screened for cervical cancer .8 Additionally, over 2.4 million health center patients were screened for colorectal cancer.9 Health center non- clinical e nabling services, including translation, transportation, outreach and education, case management , care coordination, and eligibility assistance can help to reduce disparities in access to cancer screening and referral for care and treatment for underserved populations. NCI-designated Cancer Centers10 (Cancer Centers) are scientific leaders in the efforts to reduce the unequal burden of cancer through basic, clinical translational, and population science research, and serve their communities and the broader public by integrating training and education for biomedical researchers and health care professionals. Cancer Centers disseminate evidence- based findings to their communities and study how they can be translated to benefit similar populations around the country. Cancer Centers also provide public education and outreach programs on cancer prevention and screening, with special attention to the needs of underserved populations. As part of your AxCS project, you will leverage the community outreach and engagement resources of the Cancer Centers to increase access and address barriers to cancer screening and referral for care and treatment .

You may use AxCS funds to contract with Cancer Center s to train new and existing health center personnel to build capacity in these areas within your health center. You will leverage Health Center Program and Cancer Center resources to assess and address barriers to cancer screening through outreach, patient education, case management, and other enabling services that will support the AxCS objectives. In collaboration with the Cancer Center, you may establish additional objectives and measures of success that you will collect and monitor throughout the period of performance. You may propose a project that focuses only on the required partnership with a Cancer Center , or you may also partner with other health centers, state/local health departments, Native American Tribal organizations, and/or community and faith- based organizations to leverage community outreach and engagement resources to increase cancer screening and referral for care and treatment. Health centers may use AxCS funds to purchase training and/or technical assistance from Cancer Centers and other partner organizations. You must clearly describe any training or technical assistance contractual or consulting costs in your budget request and ensure that all procurement costs are consistent with federal procurement standards and cost principles . 19 Refer to Figure A for a visual representation of the documented partnership between the health center award recipient, the required NCI-designated Cancer Center, and optional partnering organizations . Figure A Program Expectations 19 See 45 CFR part 75 Subpart D: Procurement Standards and 45 CFR part 75 Subpart E: Cost Principles . HRSA- 22-154 8 Post-award oversight of your AxCS award may include Project Work Plan status updates, interim data reports, or participation in site visits or targeted technical assistance . Additional details will be provided on the terms of award. HRSA expects that you will leverage AxCS funds to address issues of equity20 in cancer scree ning and referral for care and treatment , including applying an understanding of intersectionality and how multiple forms of discrimination affect individuals' lived experiences. Individuals and communities often belong to more than one group that has been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Individuals at the nexus of multiple identities often experience unique forms of discrimination or systemic disadvantages, including in their access to needed services.21 Consider your team's cultural and clinical competence, and the barriers to patients seeking cancer screening and care and treatment, including social risk factors such as food insecurity, housing insecurity, financial strain, lack of transportation/access to public transportation; 22 and other social determinants that may affect access to care, contribute to poor health outcomes, and exacerbate health disparities.23 Addressing Social Determinants of Health ( SDOH) is a HRSA objective to improve health and well - being of individuals and the communities in which they reside. Telehealth24 can be an important tool for delivering services and resources to patients, including cancer screening and referral for care and treatment. You are encouraged to use telehealth in your proposed service delivery plan when feasible and appropriate. Additional general information on telehealth can be found at https://telehealth.hhs.gov/ . Information specific to your health center scope of project is available at https://bphc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bphc/programrequirements/pdf/telehealth- pal.pdf . In addition, if you use broadband or telecommunications services for the provision of health care, HRSA strongly encourages you to seek discounts through the Federal Communication Commission's Universal Service Program. For information about such discounts, see https://www.usac.org/rural -health- care/. Patients may also be eligible for free or low cost mobile or broadband services through the Universal Service Lifeline program at https://www.lifelinesupport.org/. 20 See the HRSA Office of Health Equity and National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) in Health and Health Care f or additional information. 21 See Executive Order 13988 on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, 86 FR 2023, at \u00a7 1 (Jan. 20, 01761.pdf . 22 See the 2021 UDS Manual for additional information. 23 The PRAPARE Assessment Tool or PhenX Toolkit may support your health center with collecting data needed to understand and act on patients' social determinants of health. For additional information, see https://www.nachc.org/research -and-data/prapare/ or https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/collections/view/6 . 24 Telehealth is the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support and promote, at a distance, health care, patient and professional health -related education, health administration, and public health. Technologies include video conferencing, the internet, store -and- forward imaging, streaming media, and terrestrial and wireless communications. HRSA- 22-154 9 Program -Specific Instructions In addition to application requirements and instructions in Section 4 of HRSA's SF-424 Application Guide ( including the budget, budget narrative, staffing plan and personnel requirements, assurances, certifications, and abstract) , include the following: i.

Review and Selection Process The objective review process provides an objective evaluation of applications to the individuals responsible for making award decisions . The highest ranked applications HRSA- 22-154 27 receive consideration for award within available funding ranges . HRSA may also consider assessment of risk and the other pre- award activities described in Section 3 below. See section 5.3 of HRSA's SF -424 Application Guide for more details . In addition to the ranking based on merit criteria, HRSA approving officials will apply other factors described below in selecting applications for award. For this program, HRSA will use distribution of awards and compliance status as award factors as described below. Rural/Urban Distribution of Awards Aggregate awards in FY 2022 will be made to ensure that the ratio of rural to urban target populations is not less than two to three or greater than three to two as set forth in section 330(e)(6)( B) of the PHS Act. To ensure this distribution, HRSA may award funding to applications out of rank order. Compliance Status 30 You will not receive AxCS funding if you meet any of the following exclusion criteria at the time HRSA makes funding decisions: You are no longer an active H80 award recipient, or You have a 30- day condition on your H80 award related to Health Center Program requirement area(s). 3. Assessment of Risk HRSA may apply special conditions of award or elect not to fund applicants with management or financial instability that directly relates to the organization's ability to implement statutory, regulatory , or other requirements 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 ). HRSA reviews a pplications receiving a favorable objective review for other considerations that include past performance, as applicable; cost analysis of the project/program budget ; assessment of your management systems, ensuring continued applicant eligibility ; and compliance with any public policy requirements, including those requiring just -in-time submissions. HRSA may ask you to submit additional programmatic or administrative information (such as an updated budget or \"other support\" information) or to undertake certain activities (such as negotiation of an indirect cost rate) in anticipation of an award. However, even at this point in the process, such requests do not guarantee that HRSA will make an award. Following review of all applicable information, HRSA's approving and business management officials will determine whether HRSA can make an award if special conditions are required, and what level of funding is appropriate. Award decisions are discretionary and are not subject to appeal to any HRSA or HHS official or board. 30 See Chapter 2: Health Center Program Oversight of the Compliance Manual. HRSA- 22-154 28 HRSA is required to review and consider any information about your organization that is in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System ( FAPIIS) . You may review and comment on any information about your organization that a federal awarding agency previously entered. HRSA will co nsider your comments, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about your organization's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk as described in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.205 HHS Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants . HRSA will report to FAPIIS a determination that an applicant is not qualified ( 45 CFR \u00a7 75.212). VI. Award Administration Information 1.
