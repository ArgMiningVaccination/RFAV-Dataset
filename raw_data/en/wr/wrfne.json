It's simple and it's effective. It helps to boost your immune system and it's good to drink at the first signs of a cold, feeling sick or for prevention of sickness. The 4 ingredients/herbs tend to be items people already have in their home or are fairly accessible. I like this tea and Chinese Medicine for that matter because of its accessibility, below is the recipe and some explanations on each ingredient used... Cong Bai Tea 1 bunch of green onions (chopped) Green onions are known in traditional medicines to help dispel pathogens and helps to benefit the lungs. 2 orange peels (chopped) For hundreds of years, herbalists trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine use orange peel to improve digestion, relieve intestinal gas and bloating, and resolve phlegm. This peel acts primarily on the digestive and respiratory systems. 5 slices of fresh ginger root (1/8 thick) In Traditional Chinese Medicine fresh ginger is an herb that is used to treat the early stages of sickness that affect the upper respiratory tract, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the throat or the skin. 1 TBSP of brown sugar In Traditional Chinese Medicine brown sugar is known for its ability to tonify qi or strengthen the bodies energy in combination with the other herbs. It s also warming to the body. 4 cups of water Boil ingredients for 10 minutes, strain & enjoy! (If you are on any prescription medications that would negatively interact with any of these ingredients please refrain from making and drinking this tea.) "}
