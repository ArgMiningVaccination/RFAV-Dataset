Or a holistic dentist? Such doctors are part of a creative breed of specialists striving to fill holes in our fragmented healthcare system. Their focus is on the underlying causes\u2014physical and emotional\u2014of health problems; instead of surgery or a drug, they might prescribe hypnosis or yoga. Meet four innovative practitioners and learn what their fields can do for you. The Physiatrist \"When it comes to back pain, we believe medication is mightier than the scalpel.\" \u2014Gregory E. Lutz, MD, New York City Chronic back pain sufferers tend to choose one of two options: alternative medicine (like acupuncture) or surgery, says Lutz. \"Physiatrists bridge the gap between those two extremes.\" Their goal is to help patients heal with minimally invasive care, using physical therapy, drugs, and biological treatments that stimulate the body's immune system to repair degenerating discs. About 95 percent of Lutz's patients are able to avoid an operation. The Physiatrist \"When it comes to back pain, we believe medication is mightier than the scalpel.\" \u2014Gregory E.

Infections in your mouth allow bacteria to reach other parts of your body, from your arteries to your lungs. \"Teeth aren't our main concern\u2014avoiding future health issues is,\" explains Garcia. To that end, holistic dentists aim to treat the sources of your periodontal problems\u2014with natural rinses, diet counseling, even meditation\u2014in addition to the symptoms.

Palsson, PsyD, Chapel Hill, Noth Carolina Only about half of irritable bowel syndrome patients will find real relief after six months of treatment. This statistic led Palsson to develop a radically different therapy\u2014a hypnosis technique that soothes the digestive system. After seven sessions, patients see a 50 percent reduction in their symptoms, on average. More than 400 mental health professionals in the country use this method.
