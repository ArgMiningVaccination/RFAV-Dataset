It affects many aspects of male health, such as sperm production, muscle and bone mass, and sex drive. Women also have testosterone, though at lower levels than men. In women, it has a major impact on their bodies. The hormone affects bone strength, ovarian function, and sexual behavior. Testosterone levels drop slowly with age in both sexes. The result can cause fatigue, low sex drive, and loss of muscle mass. Having normal levels can often reverse some of these problems. Natural testosterone boosters use nutrients to protect and boost your levels. Many options provide different results. This article explores the use, benefits, and effects of natural testosterone boosters. It also discusses when you should see your doctor about symptoms. Eugeniusz Dudzinski / Getty Images The Role of Testosterone Testosterone is a hormone that affects sexual development and reproduction. It is primarily produced by the gonads (the testes in men and the ovaries in women). The adrenal glands in both sexes also produce a very small amount of it. While often considered the \"male hormone,\" testosterone is important to both sexes. Testosterone in the Body Your pituitary gland works to maintain normal levels of testosterone within the following ranges to get its benefits: 280 to 1,100 ng/dL for men15 to 70 ng/dL for women In addition to its role in supporting the reproductive system, testosterone also promotes the following processes in both men and women: New blood cell production Strong muscles and bones Healthy libido Mood control Testosterone in Men Testosterone contributes to the development of primary sexual characteristics in men. These include the parts of the body required for reproduction. In men, they are the penis, testicles, and scrotum. Testosterone also regulates the development of secondary male traits. These characteristics are unique to men, but not needed for reproduction. They include: Hair growth on the face, chest, and pubic areasVoice deepeningGrowth spurts in pubertyUpper body muscular build Testosterone levels in men usually decrease by 1% annually every year after age 30. However, even in advanced age, the levels don't become completely depleted. Natural Testosterone Boosters Testosterone levels can decline as a result of age, injury, disease, or medication side effects. The effects can include: Low sex drive Reduced lean muscle mass Fatigue Irritability Erectile dysfunction (ED) Depression Low sperm production Natural testosterone boosters are supplementary herbs and nutrients that can help your body increase testosterone levels. Since there are so many formulas, it can take some time to achieve the results you desire. When effective, restoring testosterone levels can help improve the effects of low testosterone levels. Natural Testosterone Boosters vs. Testosterone Replacement Therapy Don't confuse testosterone boosters with testosterone replacement therapy. Natural testosterone boosters are supplements that contain nutrients and herbs. They are distributed as over-the-counter products. Testosterone replacement therapy is a medical treatment that uses testosterone prescribed and managed by a healthcare provider. Ashwagandha and Testosterone Ashwagandha (Indian ginseng) is a nontoxic herb that has been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. It is classified as an adaptogen, a substance used in herbal medicine to help the body deal with physical and emotional stresses. How It Works Ashwagandha is thought to promote an increase in the production of luteinizing hormone, which is produced in the pituitary gland. It supports the reproductive system and triggers testosterone production. Its stress-relieving properties may also improve libido and sperm quality. 2:01 Click Play to Learn More About Ashwagandha for Erectile Dysfunction This video has been medically reviewed by Jamin Brahmbhatt, MD May Also Treat Ashwagandha may also treat the following conditions: Stress Fatigue Depression Safety and Side Effects Ashwagandha is considered generally safe, without major side effects.

Vitamin D and Testosterone Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient that you obtain from food, supplements, or exposure to sunlight. It assists in calcium absorption. Vitamin D also supports your muscle, nerve, and immune systems. How It Works Vitamin D has an impact on improving semen quality, which can decrease with low testosterone levels. It is associated with sperm motility, a key factor in infertility. May Also Treat Vitamin D may also be used to treat: Calcium absorption Bone and muscle health Weak immune system Safety and Side Effects The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is between 400 and 800 IU/day.

Over time, the problem can damage your kidneys, soft tissues, and bones. What Is Vitamin D Deficiency? DHEA and Testosterone DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone naturally produced by the liver and adrenal glands. It also contributes to the production of testosterone. How It Works DHEA is naturally produced in your body, then turned into male and female sex hormones. DHEA supplements replace the natural levels that slowly decrease as you age. May Also Treat DHEA may also treat the following conditions: Vaginal tissue thinning (vaginal atrophy) Aging skin Depression Infertility Safety and Side Effects DHEA is likely safe to use for up to two years in doses of 50 mg daily.

How It Works Research links ginger to the support of enhanced testosterone production in males. However, the effect of ginger on testosterone is not confirmed in human males. Studies indicate ginger may promote testosterone production by mechanisms that include the following: Promoting the production of luteinizing hormone Increasing the cholesterol levels in the testes Enhancing the activity of the antioxidant enzymes Normalizing blood glucose Increasing blood flow in the testes Boosting testicular weight May Also Treat Ginger may also be used to treat the following problems: Nausea Vomiting Menstrual cramps Osteoarthritis pain Morning sickness in pregnancy Safety and Side Effects Ginger is considered safe when taken by mouth or used as a topical on the skin.

It is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions and biological processes. How It Works Research indicates that magnesium supplements have a positive effect on male gonads. The results included an increase in serum testosterone level, with more significant results in those treated for longer periods. The results support a review of findings that identify magnesium as promoting a positive influence on anabolic hormones, including testosterone, in men.

Protein and Testosterone Protein is key to cell function. It helps regulate the body's organs and tissues. How It Works Protein contributes to the normal production of testosterone when diets include protein of no more than 31% protein. Low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets that include protein levels of 35% or more are linked to lower levels of testosterone. May Also Treat Protein can also be used to treat the following conditions: Lost muscle mass Weight management High blood pressure Safety and Side Effects Protein can be consumed safely when it's part of a balanced diet. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g protein/kg body weight/day for adults. Exceeding this level of protein with a high-protein diet for long periods can result in the following side effects: Kidney stones Increased cancer risk Liver disorders Coronary artery disease Animal and Plant-Based Proteins May Not Pack the Same Punch Tribulus Terrestris and Testosterone Tribulus terrestris is an herb commonly used in Africa, Asia, and southern Europe, How It Works Tribulus terrestris contains saponins, an antioxidant that strengthens capillaries in the skin.

How It Works Zinc is important to preserving prostate health, sexual health, and testosterone levels in men. A recommended zinc dosage of 25-50 micrograms daily can help maintain healthy testosterone levels.
