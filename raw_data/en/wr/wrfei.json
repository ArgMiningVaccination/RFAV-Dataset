These students receive federal, state and institutional financial aid to help them pay for their education. There are four basic types of aid. Grants: Federal, state and institutional grants do not require repayment. Loans: Must be repaid, generally beginning six months after a student graduates or leaves school. Loans require repayment with interest charges of approximately 8 percent (depending on the program) accruing during the repayment period. Work-Study : Students can be employed either on or off campus, with the primary focus being that students enhance their field of study by working part-time in a career- related position. Scholarships and Tuition Waivers: Awards are based on financial need, academic achievement and the quality of the personal essay that is submitted as part of the scholarship application process. What is Financial Need? For most aid programs, financial need is defined as the difference between what it costs to attend school and what the student can afford to pay. The amount a student should be able to pay is determined by a standard, federally mandated need- analysis method. The method establishes whether a student is financially independent (unmarried students under the age of 24 years may be considered dependent and in that case must provide parent information) or financially dependent on his or her parents and takes into account past earnings and benefits, a percentage of net assets and all other sources of support.There is no income standard or other simple method of determining whether a student will qualify for need-based financial aid. Any student who thinks he or she needs help should apply. If a student has additional medical, transportation, child-care, or other unusual expenses not covered by the living allowance, the student may, by submitting a revision request with documentation (physician's statement, child-care, or baby-sitter bills, etc.), ask Office of Student Financial Aid to consider the additional costs in his or her budget. Eligibility for Financial Aid To qualify for federal financial aid, a student must: Be a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or other eligible noncitizen Be admitted to the University in an approved program and meet minimum enrollment requirements (distance learning, correspondence and most nonmatriculated students are not eligible for financial aid) Not be in default on a previous student loan or owe a repayment on a grant or loan for which the student was not eligible Be registered with the Selective Service (if required) Be making satisfactory academic progress (The definition of satisfactory progress differs with different kinds of aid. In general, undergraduate students are required to register for and complete 12 credits per quarter; graduate students, 10 credits per quarter. Check with the financial aid staff for detailed information.) Provide financial information (including parents' information, where required) Be free of any federal or state drug- related convictionsEligible students are considered for funding based on three things: need, class level, and state residency status. Need determines priority for those programs within the class level. Students with the fewest resources are given first priority for all aid funds. Application and Important Dates The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the basic application for most types of financial aid. Students may complete and submit their FAFSA information directly to the federal processor online. Students must apply for a Personal Identification Number (PIN) in order to complete the online FAFSA. PINs can be obtained by registering through www. pin.ed.gov. T o access FAFSA on the Web, go to www.fafsa.ed.gov . Applications are also available from the Office of Enrollment Services. Students should complete their FAFSA for the upcoming year (defined as Summer through Spring quarters) beginning in mid- December or early January. A student who wishes to apply for financial aid to support study during Summer Quarter must submit a separate application. Renewal Application Students who have filed a FAFSA before must complete a Renewal Application before each academic year in order to continue to be eligible for aid. The Renewal Application can be completed online (again, a PIN is required). Priority Dates For priority consideration, the FAFSA, Renewal FAFSA or FAFSA on the Web must be dated as received by the federal application processor by Feb. 28 of each year. Students are encouraged to mail the FAFSA no sooner than Jan. 1 and no later than Feb. 15 before the upcoming academic year. Students who submit their FAFSAs after the priority date, fifth-year students and part-time students may be eligible to borrow funds through the Federal Stafford Loan or the Federal PLUS/Federal Supplemental Loan programs. Undergraduates may qualify for a Federal Pell Grant.\u0018 Financial AidBecause the priority date falls before the income tax deadline, students and parents can use estimated income figures if their tax information is not prepared. Tax and asset documents may be requested at a later date to verify information provided on the initial application. Students who apply for financial aid should remember to keep copies of financial documents used in completing the FAFSA, should stay in touch with the financial aid counselor and should notify the Office of Enrollment Services of any change in address. Consortium Agreements UW Tacoma students will occasionally need to enroll at a community college to complete admission deficiencies. The credits at the community college may be counted toward the student's total quarter enrollment credits using a Financial Aid Consortium Agreement. Both UW Tacoma and the community college must approve Consortium Agreements. If approved, Consortium Agreements enable the student to receive financial aid based on the total credits being taken at both institutions. Agreements must be submitted to the Office of Enrollment Services no later than three weeks prior to the start of the quarter. Scholarships Consideration for need-based scholar- ships is given based on information received on the FAFSA (on-time applicants only). Scholarship lists are available through the Office of Enrollment Services and at Web sites listed later in this section. UW Tacoma offers several full and partial scholarships available to fund study only at UW T acoma. For information on scholarship opportunities, contact the Office of the UW Tacoma Registrar and Financial Aid at (253) 692-4400 or check online at www.tacoma. washington.edu/naid .

The amount charged for resident undergraduate tuition and fees is set by the state and is indexed to the cost of instruction. Tuition and fees for non- residents and graduate students are set by the University of Washington Board of Regents. Because inflation increases costs, tuition rates generally increase each year. Since University costs are supported by the state, the rates charged to students who are not residents of Washington state are higher than the rates for residents. Please refer to the Registration, Academic and University Policies sections for information regarding residency classification. Tuition charges are based on the student's classification (undergraduate or graduate) rather than on course level. See chart on next page for tuition rates. Rates are subject to change without notice. tuition and f ee Payment Students incur an obligation to pay tuition and fees in U.S. dollars when they register. Students receive e-mail notification once tuition charges are available on MyUW. Payment in full of tuition is due by Friday of the third week of the quarter. Nonpayment of tuition and fees by the due date results in a charge of $50 for balances of $50 to $250 and $120 for balances in excess of $250. Students with an overdue balance will not be allowed to register for the next quarter. Options for tuition payment Plan 1: Tuition in Full This plan is best for students receiving financial aid (such as loans, grants, scholarships and Chapter 31 V .A. benefits) and those who are able to pay their tuition in full. Payment by check or money order may be made to the UW Tacoma Cashier or mailed directly to the UW Student Accounts Office, Campus Box 355870, Seattle, WA 98195. Credit card payments may be made online through MyUW. There is a convenience charge assessed when using this option. The amount in full is due by Friday of the third week of the quarter. Tuition may be paid out of the financial aid award or by using emergency loans. Plan 2: Tuition Installment Plan This plan is best for students who are not receiving financial aid and who would like to make payments over several pay periods. Students must enroll for this option each quarter with the UW Tacoma Cashier during the first week of the quarter. One third of the tuition plus a $10 service charge is due by the first Friday of the quarter. The remaining balance of tuition is due in two equal payments on the third and fifth Fridays of the quarter. T o qualify for the installment plan all payments must be made on time. The second and third payments are subject to late fees as shown in the table on page 14. Payments must be made to the UW Tacoma Cashier. When the payment is not in conformance with the tuition and fee billing, specific instructions on how the payment is to be applied must accompany the payment. In the absence of instructions, the University makes a reasoned interpretation of the student's intent and accounts for the funds accordingly. The student number must be specified on all payments. Tuition Forfeiture When students drop or withdraw from courses after the first week of the quarter and the drop results in lower tuition, the University reserves the right to collect one-half the tuition through the 30th calendar day of the quarter for the dropped course or courses and full tuition after the 30th calendar day of the quarter. In some circumstances students may petition the registrar to have the tuition forfeiture waived. Details are available in the Office of the Registrar (see Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees). Request to W aive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees If a student feels that he or she has been charged a tuition forfeiture or registration fee in error or wishes to contest a forfeiture or fee, he or she may complete a Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees form. Failure to receive a tuition bill does not nullify a student's responsibility for payment by the tuition due date and is not an acceptable justification for a waiver. Please refer to the form for appropriate guidelines for granting these requests. Petitions must be received by the UW Tacoma Registrar no later than the last day of instruction. Tuition and Fee Refund When a fee payment is made by check, a waiting period is required before a refund can be authorized. An application for refund may be refused unless it is made during the quarter in which the fees apply. A student who withdraws for disciplinary reasons forfeits all rights to refund or cancellation of any portion of his or her fees. other f ees Explanation of fees where necessary follows. All fees are subject to change without notice. Application Fees There is no reduction in fees for auditors.

The fee is a service charge, not a penalty, and is in addition to any change in tuition or forfeiture as a result of adds, drops or changes. There is no charge prior to or during the first week of classes. Late Registration Fee A late registration service charge of $25 is assessed when a student registers for the first time after the last scheduled day of Period II registration (the Sunday before the quarter begins) and through the 10th day of the quarter. If circumstances warrant, waiver of the service charge may be petitioned to the UW Tacoma Registrar using the Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees form. Re-registration Fee A student who must re-register as a result of a previous quarter's cancellation for nonpayment of tuition must pay a $75 fee. If circumstances warrant, a waiver or refund of the registration or the re-registration service charge may be sought by petition to the UW Tacoma Registrar using the Request to Waive Tuition Forfeiture or Registration Fees form. Special Course and Laboratory Fees Some courses have extraordinary expenses associated with them and, in such cases, the University may charge additional fees in amounts that approximate the added instructional or laboratory costs. T echnology Fee This fee is to recover, in whole or in part, the costs of providing and maintaining services to students that include, but are not limited to the following: access to the Internet *The Student Technology Fee, based on the number of credits taken, is already included in the tuition rates shown.2006-2007 Tuition Rates* Tuition rates are subject to change without notice.

Part-time students (those paying less than full-time tuition) are charged on a prorated basis. The fee is included on the quarterly tuition billing. financial o bligations The comptroller is authorized to place an administrative hold on the records of any student who fails to pay amounts due to the University. Until this hold is cleared, the University does not release the student's record or any information based on the record, does not prepare transcripts or certified statements, and denies registration as well as graduation from the University. Tuition and fees (including parking and library fines) not paid by the end of the academic quarter are subject to an interest charge of 1 percent per month, or fraction thereof (12 percent APR), beginning the month following the end of the quarter. An administrative hold also may occur when a student has not complied with University rules, followed University procedures or satisfied student obligations. The hold may be placed on the student's record by the authorized University office responsible for enforcement of the rule, procedure or obligation involved. The student is not permitted to register for any subsequent quarter or to obtain a transcript of his or her record or a certified statement except on the written release of the office that placed the hold. tuition e xemption Eligible University and State of Washington employees and members of the Washington National Guard may enroll for and receive a tuition exemption for up to six credits each quarter, provided they enroll on a space-available basis. Eligible students are allowed to enroll for more than six credits and will be charged tuition accordingly for the additional credits. All students participating in the tuition-exemption program will be assessed a quarterly $30 registration fee and must pay other applicable fees, including the technology fee. A participating student may not register for any course, including the credits beyond six that the student will be paying for, prior to the student's assigned space-available registration day or the exemption will be canceled. Matriculated students desiring a higher registration priority to facilitate course enrollment may choose to cancel their exemption for the quarter, register early and pay regular tuition rates. Space availability applies to degree programs as well as courses, and fully enrolled programs may not have space to accommodate students using the tuition exemption. Eligible students must hold one of the following statuses on the day the exemption form is approved, and must be in that status on the first day of the quarter for which the exemption was granted. T o be eligible a student must be: A University of Washington employee: permanent classified or contract classified staff who are employed half-time or more with six months or more of continuous service prior to the first day of the quarter and faculty/ professional staff employed half-time or more on the first day of class. A non-University of Washington permanent classified or contract State of Washington employee employed half-time or more, A permanent classified or exempt paraprofessional employee of a technical college employed half-time or more, A non-academic employee or member of the faculty or instructional staff employed half-time or more at a state institution of higher education other than the University of Washington, or A member of the Washington Army National Guard or Washington Air National Guard. A note of caution: A UW employee pursuing a graduate program or graduate- level coursework claims the amount of the quarterly exemption as income on the federal income tax return unless his or her supervisor has certified that the program or coursework is job related. If it is determined that the course is not job related, the value of the exemption will be considered income and subject to withholding. Qualifying Courses Courses that involve intensive one-on- one interaction between faculty member and student (such as independent study, research and some fieldwork courses) do not qualify under the definition of \"space available.\" Tuition-exempt students may be required to pay full tuition to enroll in these courses. See the quarterly Registration Guide for details. All 600- and 700-level courses are excluded from the tuition exemption program.Admission Status Individuals who wish to participate in the tuition exemption program must apply for admission to the University of Washington Tacoma. Applicants are subject to the same priority application dates as other new students. Individuals wishing to apply as a matriculated student or as a graduate nonmatriculated student, to a UW Tacoma academic program, should contact the specific UW Tacoma program office for details regarding the application process and space availability in the program. New nonmatriculated students should submit an application for admission to the Office of Enrollment Services. Because tuition exempt paperwork must be received no later than 10 working days prior to the start of the quarter, new applicants are encouraged to submit their paperwork regardless of their pending application status. Program participants who are former UW Tacoma students returning in the same classification or as nonmatriculated students should submit their application for admission to the Office of Enrollment Services. Registration and fees The Office of the UW Tacoma Registrar accepts tuition exempt paperwork for the next quarter beginning the Monday after the 10th day of the current quarter. Paperwork must be submitted each quarter and must be received no later than 10 working days prior to the first day of the quarter in which attendance is planned. UW Tacoma strictly adheres to this deadline. Paperwork must be complete, including required signatures, or it will be returned. Paperwork that has been returned must be completed by the same deadline noted above. Actual registration for courses begins through MyUW on or after the appropriate eligibility dates as listed in the quarterly Registration Guide. Under the tuition exemption program, tuition-exempt students must pay the quarterly T echnology Fee. They will be billed this fee, and any other applicable fees, plus the $30 tuition exemption registration fee once they have registered for a course. UW faculty/staff ID cards may be used for library services. Participating state of Washington employees and members of the National Guard may obtain student ID cards for library services from the Office of Enrollment Services. More information and the quarterly required tuition exemption form are available in the Office of Enrollment Services.13 RegistrationRegistration Registration Eligibility Continuing University of Washington Tacoma students who remain in good scholastic standing are guaranteed the opportunity to register each quarter at UW Tacoma as long as they maintain continuous enrollment (excluding Summer Quarter) or satisfy the guidelines of the quarter-off policy. Continuation must be in the same classification (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) and at the same campus. After a student has earned a baccalaureate degree, he or she must apply for readmission as a postbaccalaureate, nonmatriculated or graduate student before being allowed to register. Newly admitted students and students readmitted to the same or a new classification (undergraduate, postbaccalaureate or graduate) or admitted to a different University campus are eligible to register during a specified time period. See \"Registration Periods\" on page 18. Exceptions to the guarantee of registration eligibility include students under disciplinary action, students with a financial hold on their records and students failing to meet conditions of admission or not meeting program or University satisfactory-progress policies. Additionally, continuing students who withdraw during the first week of two consecutive quarters (Summer Quarter not included) will not be eligible to register as continuing students for the third quarter and must reapply as former students returning to the University. If an undergraduate does not enroll for two or more quarters, he or she must file a Returning Student application for readmission with the Office of Enrollment Services.Quarter-Off Policy Undergraduate students who have completed a quarter at the University of Washington Tacoma, may take the following quarter off and remain eligible to register during Registration Period I for the subsequent quarter without reapplying as a returning student. Any quarter from which a student has completely withdrawn, or from which he or she is canceled, does not constitute a completed quarter. Summer Quarter enrollment is not required to maintain continuous registration eligibility. The quarter-off policy is not available for graduate students; please see Graduate Student On-Leave Status. Graduating Senior Priority Graduating seniors or postbaccalaureate students with a degree application on file in the Graduation Office may register on the first day of Period I for their final two quarters. Students who postpone their graduation may save their priority quarters by not registering before their regular senior or postbaccalaureate priority day. When students have used their Graduating Senior Priority for two quarters, their registration priority reverts to the regular senior or postbaccalaureate schedule. Students may not register for classes in any quarter beyond the quarter for which they have applied to graduate (except Summer Quarter). Registering at Other UW Campuses Students who have completed at least 15 credits at the Tacoma campus are eligible to register for up to five credits per quarter at one of the other UW campuses during Registration Period II. Eligible students should meet with their adviser, complete an Add/Drop card with the signature of their adviser and take it to the Office of the Registrar to register. Undergraduate students are limited to a total of 45 credits and graduate students are limited to 12 credits through cross-campus registration.Dropping a Course Students dropping a course during the first two weeks of a quarter shall have no entry on their permanent academic transcript except notice of withdrawal from the University if all courses are dropped, in which case a complete withdrawal date is recorded on the transcript. A course drop made during the third through the seventh week of the quarter will be recorded on an undergraduate student's transcript with a \"W\" grade and a number designating the week of the quarter in which the course was dropped. Students may drop only one course each academic year (Autumn through Summer quarters) from the third through the seventh week of the quarter. T o drop a course officially, a student must complete the transaction electronically using MyUW or submit a drop card in the Office of the Registrar. A student who drops a course unofficially (only through the instructor or adviser, for example) is given a grade of 0.0. Students receiving or applying for financial aid should check with the financial aid counselor before dropping a class because it may affect financial aid eligibility. Students should be aware that dropping a course may affect their student account. Please see the \"Tuition and Fees\" section of this catalog. During Summer Quarter, the timeline for dropping a course is abbreviated due to the shortened session. Please consult the Summer Quarter Registration Guide for specific dates. Hardship Withdrawal Policy Students may petition the UW Tacoma Registrar in writing for a Hardship Withdrawal if they are unable to complete a course due to physical or mental debilitation or unusual or extenuating circumstances beyond their control that may have arisen and prevented them from dropping the 1\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 Catalogcourse by the seventh week. Petitions must be filed promptly after the occurrence of the event that gave rise to the need for dropping, preferably prior to the end of the quarter. Only in rare circumstances will petitions be accepted after the close of the quarter in which the withdrawal is being petitioned. Students who have completed the requirements for the course are generally not eligible for a hardship withdrawal. The Petition for Hardship Withdrawal should be completed by the student and submitted to the UW Tacoma Registrar. Supporting documentation as detailed on the petition form must accompany the petition. The UW Tacoma Registrar reserves the right to verify the authenticity and details of the documentation. Complete Withdrawal from the University for a Registered Quarter (dropping all courses for the quarter) It is the student's responsibility to withdraw from all courses if he or she is unable to attend. Students may withdraw using the electronic registration systems through the unrestricted drop period. Beginning with the third week of the quarter, official withdrawals must be submitted to the UW Tacoma Registrar and must include the signature of the program adviser. An official withdrawal is effective the date of the last drop made electronically, the date it is received in the Office of the Registrar, or if submitted by mail, the date of the postmark. Tuition owed will be based on the date the complete withdrawal is received. Withdrawals are NOT accepted after the last day of instruction for the quarter. The tuition forfeiture schedule for complete withdrawal from the University is as follows: Students who withdraw on or before the seventh calendar day of the quarter do not pay tuition. Students who withdraw after the seventh calendar day through the 30th calendar day continue to owe one half of their tuition. Students who withdraw after the 30th calendar day continue to owe full tuition. The following principles apply to complete withdrawal from the University: Courses dropped as part of a complete withdrawal from the University during the first two weeks of a quarter are not recorded on the student's UW transcript; however, the date of the complete withdrawal is recorded. A recipient of veterans benefits should immediately notify the veterans benefits coordinator of withdrawal. A student with a scholarship or loan awarded through the University should notify the financial aid counselor of withdrawal. Withdrawal for Military Service Students who are conscripted into the U.S. armed forces or called to active military duty may withdraw through the end of the seventh week of instruction and receive a full refund but no academic credit. If a student withdraws after that date, the student may receive either a full refund or academic credit and no refund. Please consult with the Office of the Registrar for complete details. Registration Guide Each quarter, the Office of the Registrar publishes an online Registration Guide that contains the schedule of classes, academic calendar, final examination schedule, registration period dates, deadlines (including graduation application deadlines), information about tuition and fees, and registration and withdrawal procedures. It is the responsibility of the student to know and understand these procedures and deadlines.

Permission to audit is granted by the course instructor and is generally allowed only for lecture classes. Auditors may not participate in discussion or laboratory work. Summer Quarter Students should note that due to the shortened session, deadlines for fee payment and registration transactions may vary from those of the regular academic year. A complete list of Summer Quarter courses and the quarterly deadlines can be found in the Summer Quarter Registration Guide.1\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 CatalogAcademic and University Policies academic Policies UW Tacoma uses a numerical grading system. Instructors may report grades from 4.0 to 0.7 in 0.1 increments and the grade 0.0. The number 0.0 is assigned for failing work or unofficial withdrawal. Grades in the range 0.6 to 0.1 may not be assigned. Grades reported in this range are converted by the registrar to 0.0. Numerical grades may be considered equivalent to letter grades as shown in the chart at right. The following letter grades may also be used: CR: Credit awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The minimum performance level required for a CR grade is determined, and the grade is awarded directly by the instructor. CR is not computed in GPA calculations. NC: Credit not awarded in a course offered on a credit/no-credit basis only or in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 and 800. The grade is awarded directly by the instructor and is not included in GPA calculations. S: Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. An S grade is automatically converted from a numerical grade of 2.0 or above for undergraduate classes and 2.7 or above for graduate classes. The grade S may not be assigned directly by the instructor, but is a grade conversion by the Office of the UW Tacoma Registrar. Undergraduate students may elect this option only for free electives and cannot be used to satisfy a University, college or department course requirement. With the approval of their program adviser, graduate students may elect to be graded S/NS in any numerically-graded course for which they are eligible. Depending on the program, up to 25 credits of S/NS grades may be applied to an undergraduate degree. S is not computed in GPA calculations. There is no limit on the number of S credits that can be applied to a graduate degree. Undergraduate graduate Letter Grade Point Letter Grade Point Grade Equivalent Grade Equivalent A 3.9 - 4.0 A 3.9 - 4.0 A- 3.5 - 3.8 A- 3.5 - 3.8 B+ 3.2 - 3.4 B+ 3.1 - 3.4 B 2.9 - 3.1 B 2.9 - 3.0 B- 2.5 - 2.8 B- 2.5 - 2.8 A minimum of 2.7 is C+ 2.2 - 2.4 required in each course C 1.9 - 2.1 that is counted toward C- 1.5 - 1.8 a graduate degree.

No credit earned. NS: Not Satisfactory grade for courses taken on a satisfactory/not-satisfactory basis. A grade less than 2.0 for undergraduate classes and 2.7 for graduate classes is converted to NS. NS is not included in GPA calculations. No credit is awarded for courses in which an NS grade is received. I: Incomplete. An Incomplete is given only when the student has been in attendance and has done satisfactory work until within two weeks of the end of the quarter and has furnished proof satisfactory to the instructor that the work cannot be completed because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control. To obtain credit for the course, an undergraduate student must convert an Incomplete into a passing grade no later than the last day of the next quarter. The student should never re-register for the course as a means of removing the Incomplete. For undergraduate students, an Incomplete grade not made up by the end of the next quarter is converted to a grade of 0.0 by the Office of the Registrar unless the instructor has indicated when assigning the Incomplete grade, that a grade other than 0.0 should be recorded if the incomplete work is not completed. The I (Incomplete) is not removed from the permanent record and appears on the transcript with the completed grade. An instructor may approve an extension of the Incomplete removal deadline by contacting the UW Tacoma Registrar no later than the last day of the quarter following the quarter in which the Incomplete grade was assigned. Extensions, which may be granted for up to three additional quarters, must be received before the Incomplete has been converted into a failing grade. In no case can an Incomplete received by an undergraduate be converted to a passing grade after the lapse of one year. W: Official withdrawal or drop from a course from the third through the seventh week of the quarter for undergraduates. A number designating the week of the quarter is recorded with the W when a course is dropped. It is not computed in GPA calculations. HW: Grade assigned when a student is allowed a hardship withdrawal from a course after the 14th calendar day of the quarter (see Hardship Withdrawal Policy on page 17). It is not computed in GPA calculations. letter graDe eQUivalents1\u0018 Academic and University PoliciesN: Indicates that the student is making satisfactory progress and a final grade will be given at the end of the quarter the work is completed. Used only for hyphenated courses (courses not completed in one quarter) and courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750 or 800. Grade-Point Average (GPA) The cumulative GPA includes credits granted for courses taken in residence at all campuses of the University of Washington and those with a DL (Distance Learning) suffix taken through UW Educational Outreach (UWEO). The UW transcript also reflects grades for other UWEO courses that are not residence credit and grades for credit by examination. These latter grades do not affect the student's UW cumulative GPA. Computation of GPA The grade-point average for graduation is computed by dividing the total cumulative grade points by the total credits attempted for courses taken in residence at the University. Grade points are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the numeric value of the grade for each course. The sum of the grade points is then divided by the total credits attempted. Courses elected on an S/ NS basis are counted as follows: Satisfactory grades are printed on the permanent record as an S and do not count in the quarterly or cumulative grade-point average, but they do count as credits earned toward graduation. Not-satisfactory grades (NS) do not count in the quarterly and cumulative grade-point averages and do not count as credits earned toward graduation. Example 1: Grade Course Credits Grade Points TIAS 498 3 x 0.0 = 0.0 TSMIN 300 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TCSIUS 445 5 x 3.2 = 16.0 30.5 T otal credits earned toward graduation: 10 T otal graded credits attempted: 13 Grade-point average = 30.5 \u00f7 13 = 2.35 The total graded credits attempted, not the credits earned toward graduation, are used in computing the GPA. Example 2: Grade Course Credits Grade Points TBUS 300 5 x 2.3 = 11.5 TBUS 310 5 x 2.9 = 14.5 TBUS 320 5 x I = 0.0 26.0 T otal credits earned toward graduation: 10 T otal graded credits attempted: 15 Grade-point average = 26.0 \u00f7 10 = 2.60The student attempted 15 credits, but only 10 are graded; the I is not computed in the grade-point average. If the work in TBUS 320 is not made up by the end of the quarter, the I will convert to a numeric grade of 0.0 and the grade-point average will be recomputed. When the grade of 0.0 is received, it is computed in the grade-point average, but no credit is awarded toward graduation. Repeating Courses With the approval of the academic program offering the course, a student may repeat a course once. Both the original grade and the second grade will be computed in the grade-point average, but credit will be allowed only once. V eterans receiving benefits must receive approval from the veterans coordinator in the Office of Enrollment Services before a course is repeated. Class Attendance The University of Washington Tacoma reserves the right to drop students who have not attended class during the first week of the quarter to make space for other students waiting to enroll. However, students should not assume that they will automatically be dropped from a course if they do not attend. It is the student's responsibility to drop the course through MyUW. Students who are registered for a course section but do not attend will be assigned a failing grade by the instructor. Students may not attend a course in which they have not been officially registered after the first two weeks of the quarter. An instructor may allow a student to attend his or her class only if the student's name appears on the official class list from the Office of the Registrar. Other faculty members may attend informally with the approval of the instructor. Grading Procedures Change of Grade Except in case of error, an instructor may not change a grade that he or she has submitted to the registrar. A student who finds administrative omissions or errors in a grade report must make application for a review not later than the last day of the student's next quarter in residence. Grades used to meet graduation requirements cannot be changed after the degree has been granted. Students are not automatically notified of grade changes posted after the first of the quarter. Grade Appeal Procedure A student who believes he or she has been improperly graded first discusses the matter with the instructor before the end of the following academic quarter. If the student is not satisfied with the instructor's explanation, the student may submit a written appeal to the director or the dean of the program that offered the course, with a copy of the appeal also to the instructor. This must be done no later than 10 class days after his or her discussion with the instructor. The director consults with the instructor to ensure that the evaluation of the student's performance has not been arbitrary or capricious. Should the director believe the instructor's conduct to be arbitrary or capricious and the instructor decline to revise the grade, the director, with the approval of the voting members of his or her faculty, shall appoint an appropriate member, or members, of the faculty of that program to evaluate the performance of the student and assign a grade. The UW Tacoma Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and the University of Washington Provost should be informed of this action. Once a student submits a written appeal, this document and all subsequent actions on this appeal are recorded in written form for deposit in the student's file. Grade Reports The University of Washington does not mail grade reports. Students access their grades online using MyUW. transcripts Official transcripts are available from the Office of the Registrar or the Cashier's Office. Transcripts may be ordered using a request form or by written request from the student. The request must include name; Social Security number or student identification number; current phone number; date of birth; address to which the transcript should be sent and student signature. Additional helpful information includes dates of attendance and former name. Because the signature of the student is required, e-mail requests cannot be accepted. Payment of $4 per transcript is required at the time of the request by check or money order. The Transcript Request form is available online at www.tacoma. washington.edu/cashier/transcripts . Allow three to five working days for processing. Same-day requests are available for an additional $15 fee. Transcripts may be picked up in the Office of the Registrar with picture identification or mailed to a third party, per student request. Each transcript will include all coursework taken at the University of Washington, with indication of the campus where the credits were earned. Students can print out an unofficial transcript online at myuw.washington.edu .1\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 Catalogscholarship Academic Standards Students are expected to meet the traditional standards of honesty and truthfulness in all aspects of their academic work at UW Tacoma. In particular, all work submitted to an instructor in fulfillment of course assignments, including papers and projects, written and oral examinations, and oral presentations and reports, must be free of plagiarism. Plagiarism is using the creations, ideas or words of someone else without formally acknowledging the author or source through appropriate use of quotation marks, references and the like. Student work in which plagiarism occurs will not be accepted as satisfactory by the instructor and may lead to disciplinary action against the student submitting it. Any student who is uncertain whether his or her use of the work of others constitutes plagiarism should consult the course instructor for guidance before formally submitting the work involved. Satisfactory Progress The University's satisfactory progress policy requires that students complete their undergraduate degree within 30 credits beyond the minimum required for the degree. Because most degrees require 180 total transfer and UW credits, students generally must complete their programs by the time they earn 210 credits. Undergraduates who have completed over 210 credits will be notified by the end of the third week of the quarter that a hold is being placed on their registration due to lack of satisfactory progress. Students are encouraged to meet with their program adviser to prepare a graduation plan to avoid this situation. Low Scholarship Academic Warning An undergraduate student whose grade- point average falls below 2.00 in his or her first quarter at the University receives an academic warning. If a cumulative grade- point average of at least 2.00 for courses earned in residence at the University is not achieved by the end of the next quarter, he or she is placed on academic probation. Academic Probation and Dismissal for Low Scholarship An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation at the end of any quarter (except for the first quarter at the University, when an academic warning is issued) in which his or her cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.00. Once on probation, the student must attain at least a 2.50 for each succeeding quarter's work until the cumulative grade-point average is raised to a 2.00 or the student is dropped for low scholarship.Reinstatement An undergraduate student who has been dropped under low-scholarship rules will be readmitted to the University only at the discretion of the UW Tacoma Admissions, Academic Standards and Graduation Committee and only after having sat out one quarter. A student readmitted after being dropped under these rules reenters the University on academic probation and may be required to re-apply to their academic program. The student's GPA is the same as when dropped from the University, and the student may not use grades from other colleges or universities to raise his or her UW grade-point average. A readmitted student is dropped if he or she fails to attain either a 2.50 grade-point average for the following quarter's work or a cumulative UW grade-point average of 2.00 at the end of that quarter. The student is removed from probation at the end of the quarter in which a cumulative grade-point average of 2.00 or better is reached. The Petition for Reinstatement form is available from the Office of the Registrar. Senior in Final Quarter A senior who has completed the required number of credits for graduation, but whose work in what would normally be his or her final quarter places him or her on probation does not receive a degree until removed from probation. Dean's List Quarterly Dean's List The quarterly high-scholarship list includes the names of matriculated undergraduate students who have attained a quarterly grade-point average of 3.50 in the final grades for at least 12 graded credits. Appropriate high-scholarship entries are made on the student's permanent academic record. Annual Dean's List The yearly award for high scholarship is recorded on the academic transcript of undergraduate students enrolled for three quarters of the academic year (summer through spring) and who earned a quarterly GPA of 3.50 in 12 or more numerically graded credits each quarter. It is also recorded for students enrolled for four quarters who met the standard just mentioned and also earned a quarterly GPA of 3.5 or better in the fourth quarter if enrolled for 10 or more credits. Annual Dean's List Certificate Annual Dean's List Certificates are awarded to students in the senior class who have high scholastic records for their junior year. The Honors Committee on the University of Washington, Seattle campus determines the grade-point average required for the awarding of certificates. Students receive a certificate and a letter of congratulations from the UW Tacoma Chancellor.Baccalaureate Honors Baccalaureate honors cum laude, cum laude ) are awarded only to recipients of a first baccalaureate degree. These honors are earned by those students who have completed no fewer than 90 residence credits at this institution. At least 60 of the 90 credits must have been acquired on a graded basis. The University's Honors Committee determines annually the grade-point requirement for each baccalaureate honor. In recent years, approximately 10 percent of the students have been awarded baccalaureate honors. Credits earned by extension courses are not counted toward honors eligibility. August graduates who participated in the preceding June commencement should contact their program adviser regarding recognition of honors at the June ceremony. Faculty Honors At the University of Washington Tacoma, faculty honors are awarded to those students receiving a baccalaureate degree whose GPA is in the upper 10 percent of their program and who have earned between 43 and 89 graded credits at the UW. Chancellor's Medal The Chancellor's Medal, which is conferred at commencement, recognizes the graduating senior who has the most distinguished academic record. Only students who have earned at least 90 credits (43 credits for Nursing students) in residence at the University of Washington Tacoma may be considered. student r ights and responsibilities It is the responsibility of the student to become familiar with all academic and administrative regulations and procedures relating to his or her course of study at UW Tacoma. Student Conduct Code The University Board of Regents has adopted a Student Conduct Code, which applies to both academic and nonacademic conduct for students while in attendance at UW Tacoma. The University of Washington Student Conduct Code obligates students to: Maintain high standards of academic and professional honesty and integrity. Respect the rights, privileges and property of other members of the academic community and visitors to the campus. Refrain from actions that would interfere with University functions or endanger the health, safety or welfare of other persons.1\u0018 Academic and University Policies Comply with the rules and regulations of the University, its schools, colleges and departments. Violations of these standards may result in a variety of disciplinary actions, including suspension or permanent dismissal from the University. The Code specifies standards of conduct, jurisdiction for hearing disciplinary matters and due process.

Admission requirements and priority application dates vary by quarter and academic program, so it is recommended that prospective students contact the Office of Admissions Advising and Outreach for current information by calling (253) 692- 4742. Additional information is also available on our Web site at www.tacoma.washington. edu/admissions. freshman a pplicants Students with less than 40 college-level credits at the time of application should complete the Application for Freshman Admission. This includes high school students who have not attempted college- level coursework and Running Start students who have less than 40 college-level credits at the time of application. (Running Start students who have completed 40 or more college-level credits at the time of application and meet transfer admission requirements, should apply using the Transfer Application for Admission.) Freshman applicants must meet high school core subject requirements, have a minimum 2.0 GPA and submit SAT or ACT scores. Applicants will be evaluated on a number of factors, including the following: grades and test scores, rigor of curriculum; activities and accomplishments; educational goals; diverse life experiences; and first- generation college status. These factors are not of equal weight and no single factor will be sufficient to confer admission. The University will offer admission to applicants who will most benefit from and contribute to the University's educational community. In selecting the freshman class, the University will not make admission decisions solely on the basis of past academic accomplishments. The intention is to enroll a freshman class that, as a whole, represents the diversity of our community.College-level credit will be awarded for those courses that have been successfully completed and meet UW transfer credit equivalencies; evaluation for appropriate placement into the UW Tacoma freshman core curriculum will be conducted by the General Education Center. freshman a dvising Freshman advising is done through the General Education Center located in Science 102. core c urriculum The freshman curriculum is built around a series of 10-credit core courses that blend different disciplines and are built around a global theme. A different faculty team\u2014in classes with a student-to-faculty ratio of 25 to 1\u2014will teach the course from a different academic perspective each quarter. Over the course of the year, students meet a full range of general requirements but remain focused on the same global theme. A student may earn credit in English and economics one quarter, then history and sociology the next. But throughout the year, discussion, lectures, reading, writing and project assignments will focus on the same, unifying theme designed to broaden students' perspectives, not only about what they are studying, but also about the world in which they live. Students will take core courses with the same group of students throughout their first year. Within those core courses, students will meet regularly in smaller groups, and be able to choose a separate elective course each quarter. Beyond the core curriculum, students select each quarter from a range of elective courses that will allow them to explore and prepare for potential majors.transfer a pplicants Students who have completed 40 or more college-level credits at the time of application should complete the Application for Transfer Admission. Transfer students who have a minimum 2.0 GPA, have fulfilled core subjects requirements and have completed at least 40 college-level credits, including five credits of English composition or its equivalent, at the time of application will be considered for admission to the University. Most transfer applicants who have completed the equivalent of two years of coursework at a community college or four- year college prior to the quarter for which they are seeking admission are generally considered for admission to an academic program at the time of application. Some academic programs admit transfer students with less than the equivalent of two years of college-level coursework. See the individual program sections for details regarding specific admission requirements. core s ubjects requirements Students are required to complete a minimum level of preparation in six subject areas in high school. More information about each of the core requirements is available online at www.tacoma.washington. edu/admissions/freshman/core_subjects.cfm . Minimum High School Preparation SUBJECT REQUIREMENT English ......................................... 4 years Mathematics ................................ 3 years Social studies ............................... 3 years Foreign language ......................... 2 years Science ......................................... 2 years Fine, visual or performing arts ....\u00bd year Academic electives ....................... \u00bd year21 Undergraduate Admission and GraduationUsing College Coursework to Complete Core Requirements Almost all applicants will have satisfied these requirements through high school coursework, which is generally defined as that completed in grades 9-12. However, there are several ways to satisfy high school core subjects requirements at the college level. In general, five quarter credits (or three semester credits) at the college level equals one year of high-school study. If you completed a portion of the core subjects requirements in high school, you can pick up in college where you left off in high school. For example, if you completed three years of English in high school, you can use one college English composition or literature course to bring your total to four years. Grading Restrictions To satisfy any of the core subject requirements, a passing grade, including a 'D,' is acceptable in either high school or college work. Also acceptable is a grade of 'Pass' in a course taken on a 'Pass/Not Pass' basis. However, if you are completing high school core subjects through college coursework, you are strongly encouraged to take core subjects for a letter/numerical grade, because you may later want to apply core courses towards requirements for your major or university or college graduation requirements, for which grading restrictions pertain. application Process There are two ways to complete the application process for the University of Washington Tacoma: online via the Web or by downloading or requesting a paper application packet. There is no difference in the application fee, but the online application does require a credit or debit card to pay the fee. The application fee is nonrefundable.

For priority admissions consideration, freshman applications must be received by March 1. Freshman and transfer applications received after the respective priority application dates will be considered on a space-available basis. Please note that a complete application includes all forms, essays and transcripts. Also, for financial aid and scholarship consideration, your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) should be submitted by February 28. See the \"Financial Aid\" section for more information on completing the FAFSA. Notification of Admission Decision When all required documents have been received, an evaluation is made and the applicant is notified of his or her admission status. An offer of admission is generally valid only for the quarter indicated. Applicants who wish to be considered for a different quarter may be required to file a new application and pay the associated fee. (See Change of Application Quarter on page 23.) Application materials of applicants who do not register for the quarter to which they have been admitted are normally retained for a period of one year from the quarter of application. At the end of this period materials on file are destroyed unless the applicant has notified the University of a continued interest in attending UW Tacoma. Admission Categories UW Tacoma offers seven admission categories, outlined below. The Office of Enrollment Services can assist applicants who are uncertain about the proper admission category. Matriculated students New students at UW Tacoma seeking their first undergraduate degree are normally considered matriculated students and admitted to the University as freshmen or sophomores or to a specific academic program as transfer students. Postbaccalaureate students Postbaccalaureate is a matriculated status at the University of Washington Tacoma. Postbaccalaureate students are those who have completed one or more bachelor's degrees and are working toward another bachelor's degree or completing prerequisite courses for a graduate program. The application of their previous coursework toward graduation requirements will be determined by program faculty and advisers.Nonmatriculated students Although a student enrolled at the University of Washington Tacoma in a nonmatriculated status cannot earn a degree, a grade is earned and full credit is awarded and recorded on a UW transcript. The credits earned as a nonmatriculated student usually transfer to other institutions. If a student is later accepted into a matriculated status at the Tacoma campus, courses earned as a nonmatriculated student may be applied to undergraduate degree requirements, with some restrictions. Students admitted as nonmatriculated may be limited in the number of credits they will be allowed to accrue in this status. The number may vary by program. Students considering switching to matriculated (degree-seeking) status are encouraged to do so as soon as possible, as 45 of the last 60 credits of a baccalaureate degree must be earned as a matriculated student in residence at the Tacoma campus. Students who wish to change their status from nonmatriculated to matriculated must apply to do so by the priority application date of the program they wish to enter. Change- of-status forms are available in the Office of Enrollment Services. Applicants seeking matriculated status may have admission and registration priority over nonmatriculated applicants. Non-UW Tacoma students applying to the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Nonprofit Management certificate programs should apply as nonmatriculated students. Please review the program requirements for guidance in making a successful application and completing additional application requirements. Summer Only Visiting Students also apply as nonmatriculated students. Admission in this status is valid only for Summer Quarter and applicants must meet application and admission requirements if they wish to matriculate for subsequent quarters. Students admitted for Autumn who wish to begin their studies during Summer Quarter should consult their academic program. Returning former students A returning UW Tacoma undergraduate student who has not been enrolled for more than one quarter (not including summer) is required to complete and file a Returning Student Application and pay a $50 application fee by the priority application date. Because academic programs determine admission based upon prior academic record and space availability, admission is not guaranteed to returning students. Returning nonmatriculated students are re-admitted as space permits. Contact the specific academic program office to discuss the re-admission process.Pre-major students Students wishing to register for UW Tacoma courses in a quarter other than the quarter in which their desired program (for example, Nursing) regularly admits may request approval from that program to enroll as a pre-major student on a space- available basis. Transfer applicants admitted to the University and not admitted to an academic program are also admitted as pre- major students. Pre-major is a matriculated status. International students Admission of international students on F, B, J, H, L, M, R, TD and TN visas is limited and available for Autumn Quarter only. International students must adhere to the application deadlines specified above or submit their applications by July 1, whichever is earlier. Admission is offered only to international students who have completed the first two years of their degree at a Washington state community college and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Students are welcome to submit transcripts from non-U.S. colleges or universities. Credentials must be original documents or photocopies stamped as certified-true copies by school officials or other educational authorities. All transcripts written in any language other than English must be accompanied by English translations in the same format as the originals, certified as accurate by a qualified translator and providing an evaluation of the foreign credentials. Interested students should request an International Student Admissions Information packet from the Office of Enrollment Services or download the International Student application materials from the UW Tacoma Web site. Auditors Individuals who wish only to audit University courses should apply for admission with nonmatriculated standing. Attendance in courses as an auditor is by consent of the instructor involved and only as space permits. Permission to audit is ordinarily granted for lecture classes only. An auditor may not participate in class discussion or laboratory work, and the auditor's registration may be canceled at the discretion of the instructor. No record of audited courses is kept. Regular tuition and fees are charged. T o receive credit for an audited course, the student must register for the class for credit and complete the course requirements in a subsequent quarter.23 Undergraduate Admission and Graduationcompletion of academic Program admission requirements For admission to a major, each academic program at the University of Washington T acoma has established minimum admission requirements. These vary from program to program. See each program's section in this catalog for a complete list. The following are required by all academic programs: Foreign language All applicants must complete two high school years, or 10 credits at the college level, of a single foreign language. The study must be devoted to a single foreign language and must be in sequence, with no repetition of any prior term of study. Any natural language other than English that has been formally studied may be used to satisfy this requirement, including languages no longer spoken, such as Latin and ancient Greek. American Sign Language (AMESLAN, the language of the deaf community in America) will also meet this requirement. However, other forms of deaf signing and computer \"languages\" are not acceptable. The foreign language requirement will be considered satisfied for applicants who had instruction through seventh grade in a language other than English. Mathematics All applicants must complete three years of high school math through intermediate (second-year) algebra or a course in intermediate algebra in college. Proficiency may be satisfied through other coursework; check with an adviser for a list. Quantitative/Symbolic Reasoning (QSR) course All applicants must complete one Quantitative/Symbolic Reasoning (QSR) course. Coursework to fulfill this requirement can be completed through enrollment at a community college, at a four-year institution or through UW Distance Learning. In some circumstances, coursework may be completed at UW Tacoma. Some students enroll concurrently at UW Tacoma and a community college to accomplish this. Depending upon individual circumstances, students may be able to complete a portion of these requirements at UW Tacoma. Courses offered at UW Tacoma that will satisfy this requirement are indicated in the course description listings for each program. Writing All applicants must complete at least five credits of English composition to meet the minimum admission requirement. English composition courses are not offered at the Tacoma campus. Coursework will need to be completed through enrollment at a community college, a four-year institution or UW Distance Learning. Students should consider completing the required 5-10 additional credits of writing-intensive coursework prior to entering UW Tacoma. In some cases, completion of an advanced writing course at UW T acoma may be used to fulfill the English composition requirement. Courses offered at UW Tacoma that will satisfy this requirement are indicated in the course description listings for each program. Undergraduate transfer c redit To students pursuing a first bachelor's degree, UW Tacoma awards transfer credit according to the guidelines listed below. It reserves the right to accept or reject credits earned at other institutions of higher education. In general, it is University policy to accept credits earned at institutions fully accredited by the regional accrediting association provided that such credits have been earned through university-level courses (see exceptions below) appropriate to the student's degree program. For courses taken at a Washington state community college, UW Tacoma follows the list of transferable courses published in the UW Equivalency Guide for Washington Community and T echnical Colleges. Notable Restrictions on Transfer Credit Lower-division college credit Students are allowed between 90-113 transferable lower-division (100- to 200- level) quarter credit hours (depending on degree program) of the 180 credits needed for a bachelor's degree. Upper-division credits (300- to 400-level) from other four-year institutions may apply to some program requirements. For some programs, there is a seven-year limit on upper-division transfer credits that are applied toward required core or concentration courses. Please consult with an adviser for details. UW Extension distance learning If permitted by the specific academic program, up to 90 credits earned in correspondence courses offered by the Distance Learning division of UW Extension may be applied toward a UW degree. However, 45 of the student's final 60 credits must be taken in residence at UW Tacoma to meet the Final-Y ear Residence Requirement. Extension credit from other schools No more than 45 credits earned as extension credit from other schools may be applied toward a UW degree. Military credit, discussed below, is included in the 45 extension credit limit. Guidance/Personal development A maximum of 3 credits is awarded for courses in this area as part of the 15 credits allowed for vocational/technical courses.Limitation on ROTC credits Credits earned in first- and second- year military training courses may not be counted in the 180 credits that are required for graduation. Some third- and fourth- year courses may count, depending on the student's degree program. Military credit Credits earned in Armed Forces Training Schools (AFTS) and through USAFI and DANTES may not exceed 30 and are included in the 45 extension credit limit. Official transcripts or DD-214 or DD-295 forms must be submitted, and credit will not be awarded until after the student has enrolled. Scores received in such coursework are not included in the transfer GPA. Out-of-sequence courses Credit is not awarded for prerequisite courses completed after a more advanced- level course has been completed. For example, students will not be awarded credit for Spanish 102 if it was taken after Spanish 103. Physical education No more than 3 quarter credits will be allowed for physical education activity courses. Vocational-technical courses A maximum of 15 transfer credits will be awarded for a wide range of college-level courses that are vocational-technical, rather than academic, in content (i.e., bookkeeping, electronics, physical therapy technician). These credits may apply only to the elective component of a baccalaureate degree and only with program approval. Alternative credit The University of Washington Tacoma does not award general credit for work or life experience. Courses Receiving No Credit Courses receiving no transfer credit include (but are not limited to): Courses below college level (usually numbered below 100) Repeated or duplicate courses Coursework taken at an institution that is not accredited by the regional association Courses that provide instruction in a particular religious doctrine Mathematics courses considered below college level, including basic math, business math, beginning and intermediate algebra Courses offered for non-credit continuing education units2\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 Catalog Remedial English (e.g., reading, vocabulary development, grammar, speed reading, or any courses that are preparatory to an institution's first English composition course) Courses providing instruction in English as a Second Language (100- level or above) Remedial courses in any academic discipline Any course in the follow ing categories: aeronautics/aviation/pilot training air conditioning/heating-refrigeration allied health (optics) auto mechanics beginning typing carpentry/construction methods cooking/baking cosmetology custodial training/maintenance diesel mechanics fire science graphics reproduction horse-shoeing military science (lower-division) replacement parts stationary steam engineering study skills water science technology College-Level Examination Program (CLEP): The University does not accept or award credit for CLEP general or subject examinations. Any such credit awarded by other institutions, or through independent testing, will not be transferred to the University. Applicability of Transfer Credit to Degree Requirements The Office of Enrollment Services has the authority to make decisions approving transfer credit to the University and application of transfer credits to fulfill University requirements. The individual academic program offices have the authority to determine application of transfer credits to fulfill major requirements. By the first quarter of enrollment, a student should meet with a program adviser to plan a program of study. The program adviser will determine how the transfer credits may be used in meeting degree requirements.Quarter vs. Semester Credits Colleges and universities that operate on a semester system award semester credit . The University of Washington Tacoma awards quarter credit . One semester credit is equivalent to 1.5 quarter credits; one three- semester-credit course is equivalent to 4.5 quarter credits. Sixty semester credits are equivalent to 90 quarter credits. Class Standing A student's initial class standing is determined by the total number of transfer credits awarded by the University of Washington Tacoma, not by the number of years of college study or completion of an associate's degree. The following table lists the required credits for each class: Sophomore ............. 45-89 credits Junior ................... 90-134 credits Senior ................... 135 credits or more Students should note that satisfying Tacoma campus graduation requirements depends not only on the number of credits completed (a minimum of 180) but also on completion of all program requirements. Transfer GPA In calculating the transfer GPA, the following guidelines apply: Grades from all transferable academic courses attempted, from all colleges the student has attended, in which the student has received grades between 0.0 and 4.0 on a 4.0 grading scale are included in the calculation. Repeated courses. At UW Tacoma, the most recent grade for a repeated course is used in the transfer GPA. (Note: This method is different from that used in calculating the UW Tacoma GPA for UW Tacoma courses that have been repeated.) All transferable academic credit from two-year colleges is included in the calculation, even if it exceeds 90 credits. Transfer coursework completed after a student matriculates must be graded on a numerical or letter-grade basis.The following are not included in the transfer GPA: Courses considered by UW Tacoma to be below college level Math courses equivalent to MATH 098 (formerly MATH 101, Intermediate Algebra) Certain religion courses that teach from a particular doctrinal perspective or that teach preparation for the ministry Developmental or remedial courses Courses in study skills Lower-division military science courses English as a Second Language courses Vocational/technical courses Courses recorded with a grade of \"Incomplete\" Courses recorded with a grade of \"Pass\" or \"Satisfactory\" P .E. activity credits in excess of three quarter credits2\u0018graduation requirements for the baccalaureate Degree T o graduate, a student must meet University requirements; college, school or campus requirements; and program requirements. This section contains only University requirements. The graduation requirements for academic programs at UW Tacoma are explained in each program's section in this catalog. Scholastic Standards Required To be eligible for the baccalaureate degree, a student must earn a cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.0 for all work done in residence at the University. The graduation grade-point average is computed when the student has completed all work for the degree and includes only credits earned while in residence at the University. Credits Required To be eligible for graduation from the University with a baccalaureate degree, a student must satisfy all other specific program requirements and must complete a minimum of 180 academic credits. Final-Year Residency Requirement To be recommended for a first or subsequent baccalaureate degree, a student must complete 45 of his or her last 60 credits as a matriculated student in residence at UW Tacoma. T o seek an exception to this requirement, students should contact their program adviser, who will submit the request to the UW Tacoma Admissions, Academic Standards and Graduation Committee. If an exception is granted, the student still must present a minimum of 45 credits taken in residence as a matriculated student to be awarded a UW degree. Catalog for Graduation Requirements With the approval of his or her program adviser, a student may choose to graduate under the requirements of either the current catalog or the catalog in effect at the time he or she entered the program from which he or she is to graduate. If the student graduates more than 10 years after enrolling in the program, the current catalog must be used for graduation purposes. Exceptions to this rule cannot be made without official approval.W aiver of Graduation Requirements T o request a waiver of Tacoma campus or University graduation requirements a student must petition the UW Tacoma Admission, Academic Standards and Graduation Committee. A student should see his or her program adviser to obtain the petition form and initiate the waiver process. The adviser will forward the petition to the committee. An exemption from an all- University graduation requirement becomes void at the end of two calendar years from the date such exemption is granted if all degree requirements have not been completed within that period. Filing a Graduation Application A University of Washington Tacoma student must make an appointment with his or her program adviser to complete a written application for graduation. The application may be filed as early as three quarters before the expected date of graduation. The University of Washington Tacoma's absolute deadline for filing an application is Friday of the second week of the quarter in which the student intends to graduate. Students who will complete their degree requirements in Summer Quarter but wish to participate in the preceding Spring commencement must adhere to the Spring deadline. It is the student's responsibility to apply for a degree and/or certificate; degrees are not automatically awarded when requirements have been satisfied. The student's application, listing all remaining graduation requirements, and any supporting documents are prepared at the graduation appointment. T wo Majors or T wo Degrees Second baccalaureate degree A second baccalaureate degree may be granted, but a student must earn a minimum of 45 credits beyond the number required for the first degree. These credits usually must be earned in residence, with the granting of exceptions to the residency rule being the responsibility of the college, school or campus awarding the degree. The student must achieve no less than a 2.0 cumulative grade-point average in the credits required for the second degree.

Requirements of both majors must be met. Both majors appear on the transcript. Two baccalaureate degrees concurrently Two baccalaureate degrees, associated with different majors, may be granted at the same time, but the total number of academic credits earned must reach a minimum of 45 credits in excess of the number required for the first baccalaureate degree. Commencement Formal commencement exercises are conducted at the close of Spring Quarter. In April of each year, commencement information is sent to each student eligible to participate the following June (i.e., those who graduated the previous August, December or March and those who anticipate graduating in June or August of the current year). Diploma distribution Diplomas are produced approximately 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned and are mailed directly to the graduate. Undergraduate Admission and Graduation2\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 Catalog2\u0018 overvie W Business AdministrationThe Business Administration degree program is designed to prepare students for entry into professional positions in business and government. The curriculum, which leads to a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration, emphasizes critical competencies needed by students to succeed in the business environment of the 21st century. Students will learn and apply the specific skills associated with each competency in the core courses, refine and practice the competencies in their study option, and use and demonstrate the competencies in additional coursework as they fine-tune skills for their professional careers. The five competencies are as follows: T eamwork T eamwork requires interdependence to achieve a common goal. Interpersonal skills that support teamwork include leading, following, managing conflict and attending to individual differences. Communication Communication is the ability to create and exchange meaning with others in a variety of contexts. Communication is comprised of skills in speaking, writing, reading and listening. Additional aspects include giving and receiving feedback, constructing and interpreting symbolic and nonverbal messages, and employing various media technology.Strategic Thinking Strategic thinking is the process of proactively recognizing, framing and analyzing opportunities and problems in a dynamic environment. Strategic thinking requires considering multiple stakeholders in creating, evaluating and implementing systematic solutions on an ongoing basis. Additional aspects include managing ambiguity and complexity and being a catalyst for change.

A student admitted to an option has registration priority for upper-division classes in that area and has successful completion of an option noted on his or her transcript upon graduation. There are four formal options in the Business Administration degree: Accounting, Finance, Management and Marketing. Accounting The Accounting option is designed to complement the broader-based Business Administration core. Students develop skills to work in organizations and be effective decision-makers with a focus on the accounting aspects of business. Areas stressed within the accounting discipline include recording and reporting of financial data under generally accepted accounting principles, understanding tax law and its effect on business decisions, auditing financial statements using generally accepted auditing principles, understanding accounting information systems, understanding the composition of consolidated financial statements, and gathering and using cost data for planning and control decisions.

The Finance option prepares students to begin a career in portfolio management, financial planning, investing, banking, real estate investment and other related industries. Domestic and international career opportunities in the financial services industry are rapidly expanding. The Puget Sound area is well represented by successful, progressive financial firms with a high demand for professionals in all areas of finance. Management The Management option addresses the ability to lead other people, fostering the skills of planning, organizing, controlling and decision making at all levels and areas in the organization. Courses in the Management option emphasize how the tools and theories of management can help accomplish organizational goals. In addition, this option also fosters the development of skills that can be used to foster individual and organizational efficiency and effectiveness through the study of leadership, team and individual behavior, and human resources. The option prepares students for career opportunities in numerous areas: employee relations, training, inventory and material management, production and operations, strategic planning, purchasing, consulting, administration, information management, human resources, financial services, hotel and retail management, project management, organizational development, sales, and leadership in business, industry or government. Marketing The Marketing option provides the knowledge that encompasses the dynamic environment of economic conditions, consumer research, product safety, technology, legal issues and social change. The courses in this option examine consumer behavior, channels of distribution, marketing research, pricing, advertising, product development, promotion, industrial marketing and sales administration.

The General Business option is designed for the student interested in a broad perspective that draws from multiple disciplines. General Business gives students the opportunity to explore a wide range of business disciplines, including management, marketing, accounting, finance and international business. Students completing the General Business option will be well-prepared to work in small businesses where their work will span multiple functional areas or in large organizations where they will be involved with cross-functional projects or teams. Students interested in entrepreneurship will also benefit from this option, as it allows them to customize the curriculum while exposing them to all critical aspects of business. International Business The International Business option provides a focused course of study from the perspective of the global environment. Courses in the option are designed to emphasize the economic reality of the global marketplace and effective performance in the dynamic international-business arena.

Students are strongly encouraged to complete as many of the Computing and Software Systems core classes as possible before progressing to more advanced concentration courses. bachelor of a rts The bachelor of arts degree provides the student with an opportunity to experience more breadth in the academic experience, and to apply the fundamental concepts and technologies of computer science to another academic discipline. The main goal of this program is to provide an educational option for students who want a thorough and rigorous grounding in the principles of computing and computing technology, but will be \"informed consumers\" of the technology rather than \"aggressive primary builders\" of the technology. Curriculum The curriculum consists of four parts: a series of core courses, selected CSS senior electives, courses to complete a UW Tacoma minor, and additional free electives. Core Courses Computing majors begin their course of study with a group of six required core courses (30 credits) in principles, analysis, techniques and technology. These courses are directed toward learning and applying the key competencies. These courses are: TCSS 305 Programming Practicum TCSS 321 Discrete Structures I TCSS 325 Computers, Ethics and Society TCSS 342 Data Structures TCSS 360 Software Development and Quality Assurance TCSS 371 Machine Organization CSS Senior Electives CSS senior electives consist of 20 credits from 400-level TCSS courses. Available CSS electives represent several sub-disciplines in Computing and Software Systems, including: applications software development, distributed computing development (e- commerce), database and information engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, and communications and protocol software design. See an adviser for more information about which courses will be available, and when they are scheduled to be offered. Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Arts, Computing and Software Systems\u0018\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 CatalogUW T acoma Minor Students pursuing a bachelor of arts degree in CSS are required to choose a minor from one of UW Tacoma's other academic programs. Minors consist of 20-30 credits in a focused area of study. Careful planning will be required to integrate the required coursework into the student's schedule. Students will need to work closely with an academic adviser to map out a feasible schedule. See the \"Minors and Certificates\" section starting on page 107. Free Electives Free electives consist of approved courses outside the CSS program. Students will need 10-20 credits of general electives depending on the student's chosen minor. Electives provide students with the opportunity to take interdisciplinary courses to broaden their knowledge base. research and internship opportunities Research, directed reading and internship opportunities allow senior-level students to explore their unique areas of interest complemented by the expertise of the faculty and industry. Industry partner internships at software development design and implementation companies are dedicated to the students of the Institute and provide paid work experience, which complements the curriculum and often provide on- ramps to the high tech workforce. While applying the theoretical and conceptual classroom knowledge to the practical work environment, the student is creates relationships and gains a greater depth of understanding of his or her coursework. core s equencing All prerequisites must be completed before advancing to the next academic level. All courses within the major must be completed with a minimum grade of 2.0 (including TCSS 142 and 143). Advanced concentration courses build upon knowledge gained in the core courses. Courses may only be repeated once. In addition to the core and elective courses, the CSS program offers courses in programming for students who need to refresh skills before enrolling in core courses. Credit from these courses is not applied towards the Computing and Software Systems degree requirements. academic s tandards The following standards apply to all students in the Computing and Software Systems program. These standards may be in addition to other academic standards at the University of Washington Tacoma. Students must satisfactorily complete all upper-division courses at UW Tacoma by achieving a minimum grade of 1.7 (2.0 in all CSS courses). If a grade below that is received, the student may repeat the course once with the approval of the program offering the course.* Course credit will be awarded only once, and both grades will be used in computing the grade-point average. If a grade below 1.7 is received in an elective course outside of CSS, the course will not count toward graduation, but the student is not required to repeat the course. Courses in the Computing and Software Systems program may not be taken by correspondence (distance learning) without prior approval of the program. Courses in the Computing and Software Systems program may not be taken S/NS (satisfactory/not satisfactory). T o substitute for a course in the major, upper-division Computing and Software Systems courses completed at other accredited four-year institutions may not be more than seven years old. If a course is more than seven years old, the student will be required to repeat the course at UW Tacoma. Credit will not be awarded twice for the same course. Upper-division courses used for transfer credit are held to the 2.0 grade standard required for all courses for Computing and Software Systems. Students changing to a Computing and Software Systems major from another major will be required to meet program and academic performance requirements in effect at the time the major is changed. Low Scholarship An undergraduate Computing and Software Systems major who is dismissed from the University for low scholarship is removed from the Computing and Software Systems major. To continue as a CSS student in any status, matriculated or otherwise, after being removed from the Computing and Software Systems major, a student must re-apply for admission. The Admissions Committee will evaluate the student's file, personal statement requesting re-admission, and any extenuating circumstances and then will recommend action. computing l abs The Institute of T echnology has dedicated laboratories of specialized equipment to support the program.

As part of this transition, Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences now admits transfer students with more than 40 college-level quarter credits. All applicants with 40 quarter credits are expected to meet the minimum standards for freshman admission including the core subjects requirement (see Freshman Admission section), have a 2.0 GPA, and complete English composition and intermediate algebra before applying to IAS. When Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences is fully enrolled and there are more qualified applicants than can be accommodated, admission will be competitive and applicants will be evaluated on three principal criteria: Ap p ro p r i a te n e s s o f a c a d e m i c preparation for the degree program Likelihood of success in the degree program Relationship between the degree program and academic or career plans and opportunities Applicants should submit completed applications by the priority application dates. Early applications are encouraged. A completed application includes the Application for Transfer Admission, $50 application fee, two official transcripts from each college or university attended (and a high school transcript if using high school credit to fulfill admission requirements), a personal statement including life and career goals and how the IAS degree will help advance those goals.Transferring to UW T acoma Most of the concentrations in IAS blend well with a broad base of courses in the first two years, similar to what an associate in arts or science degree from a Washington state community college would provide. For students who plan to transfer from another college to UW Tacoma with approximately 90 quarter credits or an associate degree, the table below can help you select appropriate courses in the first two years of college. This table is designed to meet the general education requirements for the IAS degree. Psychology and Environmental Studies concentrations require specific lower- division coursework that should ideally be completed in the first 90 credits towards a degree. Review the individual concentration requirements in the following pages to learn more about specific prerequisites.advising Students are strongly encouraged to meet with a program adviser and faculty adviser early in their careers at UW Tacoma. Advisers can: Help students to select a concentration and determine a plan of study Provide guidance on selection of courses Offer advice about resources available to help students succeed academically Assist students in identifying career and educational goals Help students plan internships and independent studies and apply for graduation. In addition, the IAS program is growing rapidly, and an appointment with an adviser can help determine if new courses are applicable to the student's concentration requirements. 15 credits visual, literary and Performing a rts (humanities) [ v]Two years in high school of the same foreign language or 10 credits of one language at the college level.foreign l anguage individuals and s ocieties (social science) [i]15 credits the n atural World (natural science) [n]15 creditsQuantitative/s ymbolic reasoning [Q]5 credits E.g., symbolic logic, college-level algebra, statistics, pre- calculus, microeconomics or macroeconomics.

Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences\u0018\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 Catalog\u0018\u0018 overvie W Bachelor of Science in NursingPhilosophy of Undergraduate e ducation The members of the Nursing faculty believe that the purpose of university- based undergraduate nursing education is to prepare professional nurses whose practice is informed by theory and research. The philosophy of the undergraduate curriculum is rooted in values of excellence, diversity, community, social justice, integrity and creativity. Preparation for the various roles in practice requires knowledge of the arts and sciences, together with content and processes foundational to the discipline. We are a community of learners and scholars\u2014 a community created in collaboration with students. The members of the faculty believe that their teaching styles need to take into account the diverse nature of how students learn. Ultimately, nursing education requires a commitment to community service, scholarly inquiry, interdisciplinarity and life-long learning.Program o verview Students in the B.S.N. program are registered nurses who have completed the initial phase of their education through an associate degree or diploma nursing program. As most students in the UW Tacoma Nursing program are employed in a vareity of health-care settings, courses are scheduled to enable students to continue employment while enrolled in the program of study. A B.S.N. from UW Tacoma enhances the graduate's ability to contribute to his or her community's institutions and to the health of citizens of Washington state, particularly during this period of rapid change in health care. The B.S.N. curriculum focuses on critical thinking, responses to health and human functioning, nursing intervention and person-environment interaction within a context of cultural diversity. The curriculum also includes all the essential elements of baccalaureate education for professional nursing practice as defined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN). An interdisciplinary emphasis encourages an understanding of a broad range of ideas, knowledge and methods of study. Phone: (253) 692-4470 Fax: (253) site: www.tacoma. washington.edu/nursingThe Nursing program focuses on the discovery and dissemination of knowledge that promotes health. The curriculum emphasizes and fosters the integration of teaching, inquiry and service within a community of learners. Partnerships with the community assist the program in providing learning environments in which learners build upon their skills and knowledge to strengthen their understanding of local, national and global health issues.

The Nursing Program works closely with Disability Support Services (DSS) in this process. DSS is the contact point for students with permanent or temporary sensory, physical or psychological disabilities interested in requesting reasonable accommodations due to the effects of a disability. Students who wish to request reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact DSS to start the process for documenting their disability and determining eligibility for services prior to the start of the program. While this process can be started at any time, reasonable accommodations may not be implemented retroactively so being timely in requesting your accommodations is very important.

Check with an IAS adviser to learn which concentrations are most compatible with this minor. Public history engages with the past and its presentation to the public by training historians to be active participants in society. This interdisciplinary field draws on traditional historical scholarship while incorporating knowledge and methods from a variety of other disciplines including art history, anthropology, historic preservation, and library science. Public historians learn how to convey history to a wide range of audiences using new and innovative methods. Most importantly, public historians strive to teach the public about the value of history and the need to learn about the past to better understand the present and shape the future. Over the past two decades an explosion in the number of museums, historical societies and historic sites has led to increased demand for public historians. These historians work as consultants, archivists, historic preservationists, curators, educators, oral historians, media and public relations professionals and public policy analysts. Students interested in history or education would benefit from this minor by having the opportunity to apply their historical knowledge to the public sphere. This minor develops skills in historical research and methods, complementing IAS concentrations (e.g., Arts, Media, and Culture; American Studies). An internship component allows students to gain hands-on experience working for a local or regional organization in the field of public history. The South Puget Sound region has numerous opportunities for internships, including a number of institutions just steps away from the UW Tacoma campus.

For detailed information about admission to graduate studies at UW Tacoma, contact the specific program office at UW Tacoma. Priority Dates for Graduate Applications The priority dates for application to the graduate programs are listed in the table on the next page. Please note that this is the date that application materials must actually reach the appropriate offices, not the postmark date. Applying to the UW Graduate School Applicants must apply both to the UW Graduate School and to their program of choice at UW Tacoma. The Graduate School now requires applicants to apply online at: (note that the URL begins with \"http s://\") https://www.grad.washington.edu/ application An application fee of $45 must be paid by credit or debit card or electronic check with the online application. Applicants who are unable to apply online should contact their program of choice to discuss other application options. A printout or copy of the applicant's UW Graduate School application must be included with application materials sent to their UW Tacoma program of choice. Applying to a UW T acoma graduate program In addition to submitting an application to the UW Graduate School, applicants must complete a separate application and submit additional materials directly to the UW Tacoma program to which they 11\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 Catalogwish to apply. Application procedures and requirements differ by program. Please contact the specific program for details. Early submission of applications is encouraged. Some programs require additional documentation (letters of recommendation, for example). See the appropriate section of this catalog and check with the program office for current information. All records submitted as part of an admission application become a part of the official file and the property of the University and cannot be returned or duplicated. These procedures and deadlines apply to new students, visiting students and former students of the University of Washington who have not attended since receiving their baccalaureate degrees. A former student must apply as a new student for admission to the Graduate School. Contact the program of choice for specific procedures. notification of admission status When all required documents have been received, an evaluation is made and the applicant is notified of his or her admission status. An offer of admission is generally valid only for the quarter indicated. Applicants who wish to be considered for a different quarter must file a new application and fee. In some situations, the program office may be willing to update a student's application to a new quarter. Check with the program of choice for details. Admission credentials of applicants who do not register for the quarter to which they have been admitted are normally retained for a period of one year from the quarter of application. At the end of this period, credentials on file are discarded unless the applicant has notified the Office of Graduate Admissions and the program of a continued interest in attending the University.graduate credits taken as an undergraduate University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate work and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to the Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. For example, a student admitted for Autumn Quarter may take graduate credits during the preceding Spring Quarter. This registration and these arrangements must be approved by the graduate program that the student will enter. However, students so enrolling are not reclassified as graduate students until the baccalaureate degree has been granted and after their official admission. At that point, it is necessary to petition to permit the six credits to apply toward the master's degree. Only under these circumstances may graduate work taken as an undergraduate be applied toward an advanced degree. Further registration for graduate work is contingent upon completion of the requirements for the bachelor's degree. graduate n onmatriculated students Graduate nonmatriculated (GNM) is a classification for post-baccalaureate students who are not seeking a graduate degree at the time of registration. While a student does not need GNM status to register for a graduate- level class, a student must have it in order to apply the credits to a graduate degree at the University of Washington should the student later be admitted as a matriculated graduate student. GNM status is granted by the individual graduate program. A minimum GPA of 3.0 in the last 90 quarter (60 semester) graded credits is required autumn Winter s pring s ummer 200\u0018 200\u0018 200\u0018 200\u0018 Business (M.B.A.) Apr. 15 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Computing and Software Systems (M.S.)

A student who is later admitted to the Graduate School may apply a maximum of 12 applicable GNM credits (or any combination of GNM and up to six approved transfer credits, totaling 12 credits) toward a master's degree. Admission into the GNM status does not confer priority for or guarantee of later admission into the Graduate School to pursue a degree. Applicants for GNM status must contact the academic program directly for application information. Not all programs choose to offer GNM status. Programs will advise students regarding the status and provide instructions, application forms and program requirements to appropriate candidates. Failure to register for any quarter except Summer Quarter will result in loss of GNM status. Once GNM status has been lost, the application process must be repeated in order to be readmitted as a GNM student. The transcripts and other student records from the prior records can be forwarded to supplement the new application, and the new application fee may be waived. GNM students pay fees and tuition at the regular graduate-student rate based on residency of the student including the Student Services and Activity Fee and the Technology Fee. GNM students are not eligible for financial aid because most financial aid is governed by federal regulations that require students to be enrolled in degree programs. Students will be assigned a UW student number and receive a student identification card that entitles them to all privileges and access to facilities that are extended to matriculated students. visiting g raduate s tudents A student who wishes to enroll in a graduate program at the University of Washington Tacoma and who intends thereafter to return to another graduate school in which he or she is working toward an advanced degree may be admitted as a visiting graduate student. This admission is contingent on available space and facilities. Such a student must have been officially admitted to another recognized graduate school and be in good standing and currently pursuing a graduate degree. Admission to the University of Washington Tacoma, as a visiting graduate student does not guarantee admission to any particular course of study. A visiting graduate student is permitted to register only in those courses for which he or she is judged to be eligible by a faculty adviser or the instructor of the course and if space is available to accommodate registration. Further details regarding application and other relevant policies may be obtained from the appropriate program office at UW Tacoma or on the Web at www.grad. washington.edu .11\u0018transfer c redit A student working toward a master's degree may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for permission to transfer to the University of Washington the equivalent of a maximum of six quarter credits of graduate level coursework taken at another recognized academic institution. These credits may not have been used to satisfy requirements for another degree. The petition must include a written recommendation from the graduate program coordinator and an official transcript indicating completion of the coursework. Transfer credits are not entered on the UW transcript. University of Washington students who are within six credits of completing their undergraduate degree and who have met the requirements for admission to the Graduate School may register the quarter immediately preceding admission to Graduate School for up to six credits in 500-level courses in addition to the last six credits they require of undergraduate work. The graduate program that has admitted the student must approve registration for the courses. The student, after admission to the Graduate School, must file a petition with the Dean of the Graduate School to transfer the six credits. The student must also provide a letter from the Office of Graduation and Academic Records stating that these credits have not been applied toward the undergraduate degree. Contact the specific program for details. graduate s tudent Policies The following section contains detailed information concerning policies and procedures relating to graduate students and graduate studies. Students should verify all information with the program adviser of the individual academic program or appropriate staff. For more information on the UW Graduate School and graduate student policies, please visit the Graduate School Web site at www.grad.washington.edu. Graduate Courses Graduate courses are intended for, and ordinarily restricted to, either students enrolled in the Graduate School or graduate nonmatriculated students and are given numbers from 500 to 800. Some courses at the 300 and 400 levels are open to both graduates and upper-division under- graduates. Such courses, when acceptable to the supervisory committee and the specific academic program, may be part of the graduate program. The Graduate School accepts credit in approved 300-level courses for the minor or supporting fields only. Courses at the 300 level are not included in the calculation of grade-point average (GPA) and will not apply toward the minimum Graduate School requirement of 18 graded credits for the master's degree. Approved 400-level courses are accepted as part of the major as well as minor or supporting fields. Courses numbered 490 and titled Special T opics and Special Projects normally are not applicable to a graduate degree program if addressed primarily to introductory content and undergraduate students. Undergraduate research (499) is not accepted as part of the graduate program. Graduate School Memorandum No. 36 offers additional information on graduate courses. With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum 10 credits per quarter of any combination of courses numbered 600, 700 or 800. Graduate Student On-Leave Status Graduate students who do not maintain continuous enrollment (Summer Quarter excepted) must file a petition for on-leave status with their program office. To be eligible for on-leave status, the student must have registered for, and completed, at least one quarter and be in good academic standing. An on-leave student is permitted to use the University Library but is not eligible for other University privileges. On-leave status forms are available from the program office. A $35 fee is charged for each petition filed. Students who are registered for any portion of a quarter may not go on leave for that quarter unless they officially withdraw at the Office of the UW Tacoma Registrar prior to the first day of the quarter. On-leave status can be granted for up to four quarters. On-leave graduate students returning to the University on or before the termination of their authorized periods of leave need only register using MyUW for the quarter they want to return. Re-admission A student previously registered in the Graduate School who has failed to maintain graduate student status but who wishes later to resume graduate studies must apply online to be re-admitted. If the student has attended any other institution during the period when not registered at the University of Washington, official transcripts in duplicate of the student's work must be submitted. An application for re-admission carries no preference and is treated in the same manner as an application for initial admission, including the requirement of payment of the application fee. Students are required to meet the program requirements in place at the time they are re-admitted. The Graduate School normally allows six years to complete requirements for a master's degree. Periods spent on leave or out of status are included. Graduate and Postbaccalaureate Admission and Graduationgraduation requirements for the m aster's Degree It is the responsibility of each graduate degree candidate to meet the following Graduate School minimum requirements (plus any additional requirements that may be specified by the program in which the master's degree is being earned; see item 7): 1. Under a thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits (27 course credits and a minimum of nine credits of thesis) must be presented. Under a non-thesis program, a minimum of 36 quarter credits of coursework is required. 2. At least 18 of the minimum 36 quarter credits for the master's degree must be for work numbered 500 and above. (In a thesis program, nine of the 18 must be course credits and nine may be for Master's Thesis [700].) 3. Numerical grades must be received in at least 18 quarter credits of coursework taken at the University of Washington Tacoma. The Graduate School accepts numerical grades in approved 400-level courses accepted as part of the major and in all 500- level courses. The student must earn a minimum grade of 2.7 in each class in order for it to be counted. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 is required for a graduate degree at the University. 4. The residence requirement for the master's degree is one year (three full- time quarters). Students registered for fewer than 10 credits per quarter may add part-time quarters together to achieve the equivalent of one full- time quarter (10 or more credits) to be applied toward fulfilling residence requirements. However, excess credits beyond 10 may not be subtracted from one quarter and added to another. Once a student is admitted to a graduate degree program, a full quarter of residence is granted for any quarter in which at least 10 credits in approved courses, research, thesis, or internship are satisfactorily completed. 5. In a thesis degree program, a thesis, approved by the supervisory committee, must be submitted to the Graduate School. A student must register for a minimum of nine credits of thesis (700). With the exception of summer, students are limited to a maximum of nine credits per quarter of thesis (700).11\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 Catalog6. A final master's examination, either oral or written, as determined by the student's supervisory committee, must be passed if it is a program requirement. 7. Any additional requirements imposed by the graduate program adviser in the student's major department or by the student's supervisory committee must be satisfied. A master's degree student usually takes some work outside the major department. The graduate program coordinator in the major department or the student's supervisory committee determines the requirements for the minor or supporting courses. 8. The graduate student must apply for the master's degree within the first seven weeks of the quarter in which he or she expects the degree to be conferred. See Graduate Degree Application Process below. 9. The graduate student must maintain registration as a full- or part-time student at the University for the quarter in which the degree is conferred. A student who does not complete all degree requirements by the last day of the quarter must be registered for the following quarter. 10. All work for the master's degree must be completed within six years. This includes quarters spent on leave or out of status and applicable work transferred from other institutions. 11. A student must satisfy the requirements for the degree that are in force at the time the degree is to be awarded.Graduate Degree Application Process Students may submit a request for their master's degree starting from the first day of the quarter they expect to graduate until the Sunday of the seventh week of the quarter they expect to graduate. Students who miss the deadline may submit their request up to the Sunday of the ninth week of the quarter, but will pay a $250 late fee. Requests cannot be accepted after the Sunday of the ninth week. For students requesting their degree in Summer Quarter, the deadline is the sixth week. The seventh week is considered late and requires the extra fee. Requests after the seventh week of Summer Quarter cannot be accepted. If degree requirements are not met in the requested quarter or a student neglects to pay the late fee, the student must submit another degree request for the quarter they expect to complete requirements. Students will be required to have a UW NetID before completing the master's degree application. The degree application is found at: www.grad.washington.edu/stsv/mastapp. htm. Students who cannot complete the master's request online or need to make changes should contact Graduate School Student Services at studentservices@grad. washington.edu. All students should check with their graduate program to ensure they are in compliance with departmental procedures for graduation clearance. When completing the Master's Degree Request, the system will automatically run a degree audit to inform the student of any unsatisfied Graduate School requirements. Students will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of their Master's Degree Request and their department is notified that a request has been submitted. The student's department enters any department contingencies into the MyGradProgram system and can elect to send an e-mail to the student to notify them. The department will print the master's degree warrant and the warrants will be routed to the student's master's committee in a manner determined by the department. By signing the master's degree warrant, the student's committee certifies that the student has met all departmental requirements for the degree (except the thesis, if one is required) and the warrants must be placed in the student's department file. Once the warrant has been signed, the department will recommend whether or not the student is to graduate that quarter and these recommendations are conveyed to the Graduate School by the Sunday following the end of the quarter. E-mails are sent to the student notifying them that their department has made a recommendation on their request. Once the Graduate School receives the degree request recommendation, a final transcript audit and a review to determine if all Graduate School and department contingencies are met, will be completed by the Graduate School staff. The Graduate School enters the final graduation decision into the MyGradProgram system and e-mail notifications are sent to the student informing them of their graduation status. A student must be registered as a graduate student and complete a minimum of two credits during the quarter in which degree requirements are met and the degree is conferred. Commencement Formal commencement exercises are conducted at the close of Spring Quarter. In April of each year, commencement information is sent to each student entitled to participate (i.e., those who graduated the previous August, December or March and those who anticipate graduating in the June or August of the current year). Diploma distribution Diplomas are produced approximately 12 weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are earned and are mailed to the student.11\u0018 overvie W Master of Business AdministrationThe Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree is designed for working professionals who want to enhance their abilities to respond to, manage and lead change.

Program Design The 72 quarter-credit, non-thesis MBA degree has two components: 40 credits of required courses 32 credits of elective courses tailored to meet individual needs The choice of electives will depend on students' career and educational goals. Students can create a profile of elective courses that allows them to gain additional knowledge of management, information technology, finance, leadership or marketing. Elective courses also can be taken outside of Business from other UW Tacoma graduate programs. enrollment and c lasses The UW Tacoma two-year MBA allows students to continue in their careers while they develop new managerial knowledge and skills. In the average quarter, an MBA student will enroll in two courses (8 credits) of study. Students may complete their degree on a year-round basis in two years (including summers) or extend to three or more years. Classes meet primarily on weekday evenings and some Saturdays; many incorporate Internet components. Online assignments and discussion offer flexibility while keeping students connected to the faculty and their classmates. Courses integrate current conceptual and practical knowledge while building analytical and interpersonal skills. As a result, the curriculum is immediately relevant to practicing managers. The MBA program also offers a CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) option to help students prepare for the Level I exam during their second year of study. The program includes coursework, study groups and seminars that culminate in the student sitting for the exam in June.elective c redits A minimum of 12 graded elective credits must be completed in Tacoma MBA elective courses numbered 500 and above. The remaining elective credits can be completed via Tacoma MBA elective courses, credits from other UW graduate degree programs, transfer credits, or some combination of these as discussed in the policies below. No more than eight credits of TBUS 569, Analytical Research, may be applied toward the MBA degree. transfer c redits from o ther institutions An admitted MBA student may petition to transfer up to the equivalent of 12 quarter credits of graduate business coursework from an accredited institution toward the elective portion of the degree. Graduate credits that have been applied toward a completed degree cannot be transferred. Applicants may petition by sending a letter to the Graduate Program Adviser. The petition should identify the courses requested for transfer credit and, for each course, clearly articulate how the course content contributes to the objectives of the UW Tacoma MBA curriculum. Petition requests will not be evaluated until an official transcript is received by the School of Business. Written petitions for transfer credits completed prior to admission to the MBA program must be submitted during the first quarter of enrollment in the MBA program (Autumn quarter). Enrolled UW Tacoma MBA students who take courses at another institution with the intent of transferring the credits should first seek approval from the graduate program adviser. If approved, these students should submit a written petition to transfer credits within one academic quarter of completing the course at another institution (e.g. petitions to transfer summer credits must be received by the end of Autumn Quarter). Coursework that duplicates the content of required courses in the MBA curriculum will not be accepted for transfer elective credit. Petitions are reviewed by the Graduate Committee and a letter is mailed to the address of record indicating how many credits, if any, will transfer.

Those with a master's degree in computer science typically earn 25 to 30 percent higher starting salaries than those with bachelor's degrees, according to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CSS master's program serves a diverse population of students, from those with significant experience and degrees in the field, to those with non- computing-related undergraduate degrees. By broadening the base of students eligible for the program, the Institute encourages a greater number of undergraduate students to continue their education at the graduate level and to attract an increasing number of nontraditional students who have related work experience and a strong interest in the field.curriculum The Master of Science in Computing and Software Systems provides a broad overview of the technologies and theories supporting computing and software systems. Students can also focus on distributed and networked computing. The master's program advances the theoretical concepts of computer science from the bachelor's program. In addition, it requires that a student demonstrate the ability to synthesize and apply those concepts outside the classroom. These goals are achieved in three stages: Foundational courses to emphasize theoretical (conceptual) as well as practical (embodied) knowledge. Theory courses that refine critical thinking skills and breadth of knowledge.

The concept of interdisciplinary studies is founded on a recognition that the experience of phenomena\u2014such as the public problems of poverty, violence, social justice or environmental degradation\u2014do not come in neatly bounded, disciplinary or professional packages. While disciplinary divisions of labor are convenient and necessary to the efficient pursuit of in- depth knowledge, the application of that knowledge in the sphere of public action requires its broader re-integration with the rich, multidisciplinary dimensions and complexities of actual, live situations. The structure of the Master of Arts program is highly flexible, building on the wealth of interdisciplinary expertise among members of the faculty. A required series of four core courses and a capstone course addresses issues of models, problem formation, evidence, and values. The core courses examine the basic foundations of knowing and acting, making them relevant to diverse areas of specific inquiry. Through electives and a thesis (or master's project), students are encouraged to apply the lessons of the core courses to their own chosen areas of interdisciplinary interest. A broad range of student interests can be accommodated due to the interdisciplinary nature of the program. The program integrates the sociology of knowledge, philosophy, social and political theory, history, cultural studies, anthropology and systems theory to shed light on domains of public action. Examples of possible areas of interest, broadly defined, might include the environment, education, ethnicity, gender, families, arts policy and administration, children and the media, human rights, labor, immigration, trade, development, urban studies, the role of state and local government or international non- governmental organizations. Students will learn: How alternative paradigms or models condition our knowledge of the world and how our choice of potential responses connects to how we perceive things to be organized. How to gain insight into the impact of culture and history on the way certain phenomena come to be defined in the public arena as problems, and how they are variously imagined to be caused or solved in relation to diverse professional and disciplinary claims of ownership over them. How evidence can be justified, generated, evaluated and used with varying degrees of validity within diverse frames of application. Phone: (253) 692-4450 Fax: www.tacoma. washington.edu/iasBuilding on the success of the under - graduate program, Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences offers a Master of Arts degree. The graduate courses offer opportunities to pursue questions of interest across a wide range of elds, spanning the humanities, social sciences and environmental sciences, with special emphasis on the relation of knowledge to public action.Interim Director: Cheryl Greengrove Faculty Coordinator: Samuel Parker Administrator: Julie Buffington Graduate Program Adviser: Linda Kachinsky How to gain insight into the ways in which values are implicitly or explicitly present in every arena socially deemed to be problematic, and how it may be possible to facilitate communication, negotiations, or trade-offs among and across diverse value frames. What is Public a ction? Public action entails a series of determinations that are reached as a result of the following considerations: What is the nature of the problem to be addressed? What mode of analysis is to be employed? What will count as evidence? What values are considered relevant or irrelevant? What options are included or excluded? What outcomes of the action are anticipated or unanticipated?MASTER OF ARTS Interdisciplinary Studies13\u0018 University of Washington Tacoma | 2006-2007 CatalogBy exploring these questions the master's program becomes a sustained investigation of factors that critically shape actions, procedures and outcomes. The factors to be investigated include: Conceptual models, or paradigms Social, professional and institutional cultures Various types of data used to support alternative perspectives and decisions How various value frameworks shape perspectives, decisions and actions These factors provide a foundation for knowledge and action in the public sphere. The core course of study in this program may therefore apply to virtually any profession or endeavor in our shared public life, whether one works in a large organization or a one-person shop, whether one seeks knowledge for utilitarian ends or to achieve a richer understanding of the world in which everyone must live and act. Program Design The Master of Arts program emphasizes foundations of public action and is a 55- credit master's degree. The curriculum includes: Four core courses .............. 24 credits Capstone course ................ 6 credits Electives ............................ 15 credits Final project or thesis ....... 10 credits Core Courses The four core courses are closely integrated, constituting a single, extended investigation of how issues and problems are evaluated in the process of taking action. The courses examine analytical tools and how social and organizational cultures influence the work required in moving toward taking action. TIAS 501 Models and Critical Inquiry TIAS 502 Evidence and Action TIAS 503 Culture and Public Problems TIAS 504 Values and Action Capstone Course Students enroll in the capstone course (TIAS 505) after the completion of the core course series. The capstone provides a forum for re-integrating the separate themes of the four core courses and considering how they can be applied to the students' areas of interest. Area of Emphasis Students will work with a faculty adviser to develop a focus within the student's chosen area of interest. The required 15 credits of electives are to be chosen carefully in consultation with the academic adviser, as stepping stones toward the substance of the thesis or project. In addition to elective courses developed specifically for the Master of Arts degree, students can select from a wide range of courses offered at UW Tacoma, including some of those offered in other UW Tacoma graduate programs. Undergraduate courses appropriate to the student's thesis topic can be taken as graduate courses by enrolling in them as TIAS 590 Independent Study courses. This option requires completion of all the undergraduate requirements, as well as additional work to be negotiated with the instructor that will raise the course demands to graduate level. Thesis or Project The final product of the graduate program must be a thesis or a scholarly project that demonstrates a level of competence equivalent to a thesis. In consultation with faculty, students negotiate specific thesis questions and plans focused on their own chosen goals and areas of interest. It is the student's responsibility to recruit a thesis chair and at least one other reader to constitute a thesis committee. The chair may be the academic adviser or may be someone else whose area of expertise most overlaps with the focus of the thesis or project. enrollment and c urriculum sequencing Admission is competitive and is based on space availability in the core courses.
