The [vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine), administered by intramuscular injection, is intended to prevent COVID-19, which is characterized mainly by [fever](https://www.britannica.com/science/fever) and respiratory symptoms, such as difficulty breathing. The first COVID-19 vaccines were developed and made available to the public under emergency use authorization in 2020, amid the COVID-19 [pandemic](https://www.britannica.com/science/pandemic). Multiple COVID-19 vaccines have been developed. Some of the first agents included mRNA-based vaccines made by the [pharmaceutical](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pharmaceutical) and [biotechnology](https://www.britannica.com/technology/biotechnology) companies [Pfizer, Inc.](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pfizer-Inc), and BioNTech and by the pharmaceutical company [Moderna](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Moderna), as well as a recombinant version, known as the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, developed by [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Johnson-and-Johnson). The [Moderna](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Moderna-COVID-19-vaccine) and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were about 95 percent effective in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2; the Janssen vaccine was about 67 percent effective in preventing [moderate](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/moderate) to severe disease. Other vaccines included the [Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Oxford-AstraZeneca-COVID-19-vaccine), a recombinant vaccine first approved in the United Kingdom in late 2020, and the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, a protein-based vaccine that initially was made available in Europe in 2021. Protection against COVID-19 was provided by two doses of any of the different types of vaccines, given three to fours weeks apart; an exception was the single-dose Janssen vaccine. For healthy persons aged 12 and older, two doses, followed at least five months later by a booster dose, offered maximal protection; a booster was recommended two months after the single-dose Janssen vaccine. However, as the COVID-19 [pandemic](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pandemic) continued into 2022, the effectiveness of the vaccines was found to wane over time, warranting consideration of additional booster shots. In early 2022 the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Food-and-Drug-Administration) approved the use of a second booster of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech for individuals aged 50 or older, persons with moderate or severe immune dysfunction, and persons who had received a single dose and booster of the Janssen vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines were effective not only in preventing severe illness but also in limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccines also generally were safe. The most common side effects were [pain](https://www.britannica.com/science/pain), redness, and swelling at the site of injection. Some individuals also experienced [headache](https://www.britannica.com/science/headache), [fatigue](https://www.britannica.com/science/fatigue-physiology), and fever; in very rare instances, vaccination was followed by a severe allergic reaction. Side effects could be experienced after any of the doses, including following a booster "}
