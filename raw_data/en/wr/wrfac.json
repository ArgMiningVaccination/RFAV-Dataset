As permitted, the subject m atter of U.S. application Serial No. 0 9 /3 0 1 ,2 7 4 is incorporated by reference in its entirety. 10 FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating and/or preventing in mammals, particularly humans, acute inflam m atory responses and diseases. More particularly, compositions and combinations of compositions and methods for the treatm ent of disorders, especially acute 15 inflam m atory disorders, involving pathological responses of the immune system are provided. Hence the disclosure herein provides compositions and methods for preventing and/or treating diseases, disorders and conditions that include viral hemorrhagic diseases and other acute infectious diseases, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders, acute cardiovascular 20 events, flare-ups and acute phases of multiple sclerosis, wasting disorders and other disorders involving deleterious expression of cytokines and other factors, including tum or necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION DISEASES AND DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH OR CHARACTERIZED 25 BY ACUTE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES Responses of the immune system to pathogens and to other bodily insults are essential fo r survival of mammals. Inappropriate or excessive response, however, is associated certain acute and chronic diseases. In such cases, inappropriate stimulation of various defense strategies involving inflamm atory 30 cells and the immune system produces the symptoms characteristic of the disease. The response of a mammal to infection w ith a hemorrhagic virus or a pathogenic strain of Escherichia co/i and sepsis are exemplary of such WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 responses. There are few , if any, effective treatm ents to counteract these responses. INTERLEUKIN-1 AND RECEPTORS THEREFOR The tw o forms of lnterleukin-1 (IL-1o and IL-1/?) are cytokines produced 5 primarily by mononuclear phagocytes, but also by a number of other cell types including skin keratinocytes, some epithelial cells, and some cells of the central nervous system (CNS). These cytokines produce a wide variety of effects on numerous cell types, including the induction or suppression of the production of a great number of other proteins including interleukins, cytokines, tum or necrosis 10 factors, and colony stimulating factors. IL- and IL-1/? are thus im portant mediators of the inflamm atory and immune responses of animals. Because of the early appearance of IL-1 during the inflam m atory reaction and the immune response, and because of the variety of effects produced by IL- and IL-1/?, these factors are play a role in the production of pathological conditions resulting 15 in chronic inflamm ation, septic shock, and defects in hematopoiesis. The effects of these interleukins result from the binding of these factors to tw o distinct cells surface receptors, IL-1 R Types 1 and II. Type I receptor is an 80 kDa protein found on T cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes. Type Il receptor is a 68 kDa protein found on B cells and PMNs. In general, the Type I receptor binds to IL- 20 1 or IL-1/? w ith approximately equal affinity and the Type Il receptor binds IL-Iyff more strongly than IL-1 a. Results indicate that only the Type I receptor is capable of transducing a signal and can produce all of the biological effects attributed to IL-1 . It has been suggested that the function of the membrane- bound Type Il receptor is to serve as the precursor for a soluble IL-1 binding 25 factor that can be shed under appropriate circumstances to antagonize and modulate IL-1 activity. A naturally occurring IL-1 binding protein has been described that seems to correspond to the soluble external portion of the Type Il receptor. A different type of naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-1 activity was 30 discovered and purified from the urine of patients w ith monocytic leukemia. A cDNA clone encoding this polypeptide has been isolated from monocytes and found to code for a mature 152 amino acid reside glycoprotein of 25,000 nature WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 molecular weight. This molecule, known as secreted IL-1 receptor antagonist, shows 25% 19% homology to IL-1a. Evidence indicates that the inhibitory action of slL-1Ra results from binding of IL- 1Ra to the IL-1 receptor Type I w ith an affinity comparable to that of IL -Ia or IL- 5 1/? (Kd - 200 pM), thus competing w ith IL- or /? for binding to this receptor. This binding, however, does not result in signal transduction. IL-IRa binds to the IL-1 receptor Type Il w ith considerably lower affinity than that shown by IL-1/?. Cells know to produce IL-Ira include monocytes, GM-CSF and TGF-/?, the latter apparently by triggering IL-1 production which itself triggers IL-Ira synthesis (12, 15-19). The amino acid sequences of IL-Ira from at least four species have been determined (human, rat, mouse and rabbit) and found to be at least 75% homologous 15 (Cominelli et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269:6963), IL-Ira can also be synthesized as a strictly intracellular form whose production is the result of an alternative splicing of exon 1 (Butcher et at. (1994) J. Immunol. 153:701; Aren at. during experimentally- induced inflamm ation and as part of the natural course of many diseases. 20 Administered experimentally, IL-IRa has been demonstrated to block IL-1 activity in vitro and in vivo. TUMOR NECROSIS FACTORS AND RECEPTORS THEREFOR Tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) are pleiotropic cytokines that are primary modifiers of the inflam m atory and immune reactions of animals produced in 25 response to injury or infection. Tw o forms of TNF, designated TNF- (or cachectin) and TNF-/? (or lymphotoxin), have been described. These forms share 30% sequence sim ilarity and compete for binding to the same receptors. TNFs play a necessary and beneficial role as mediators of host resistance to infections and tum or form ation. Over-production or inappropriate expression of these 30 factors can lead to a variety of pathological conditions, including wasting, systemic toxicity, and septic shock (see, Beutler e t at. (1988) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 57:505; and Vilcek et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:7313). WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 The actions of TNFs are produced subsequent to binding of the factors to cell surface receptors. Tw o distinct TNF receptors have been identified and cloned. Virtually all cell types studied show the presence of one or both of these receptor types. One receptor type, termed TNFR-II (Type A, Type a, 75 5 kDa or utr antigen), has an apparent molecular weight of 75 kDa. The gene for this receptor encodes a presumptive transmembrane protein of 439 amino acid residues (Dembic et al. (1990) Cytokine 2:231; Tartaglia e t al. (1992) Immunol. Today 13:151). The other receptor type, termed TNFR-I (Type B, Type /?, 55 kDa or htr antigen) has an apparent molecular weight of about 55 kDa. The 10 gene for this protein encodes a transmembrane protein of 426 amino acid residues (Schall et al. (1 9 9 0 )C e //6 1 :3 6 1 ; Loetscher et al. (1990) Cell 6 1 :351; Tartaglia et at. (1992) Immunol. Today 13:151). Both receptor types show high affinity binding of either TNF- or TNF-/?. The tw o receptor types are immunologically distinct but their extracellular domains show similarities in the 15 pattern of cysteine residue locations in four domains (Dembic et al. (1990) Cytokine 2:231). Soluble TNF binding proteins in human serum and urine (Seckinger et at. (1989) J. Biol, Chem. 2 6 4 :1 1 9 6 6 ; Olsson et at. (1989) Eur. J. Haematol. 42:270; and Engelmann e t al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265 :15 41) that can 20 neutralize the biological activities of TNF- and TNF-/? have been identified. Two types have been identified and designated sTNF Rl (or TNF BPI) and sTNF These soluble form s are truncated forms of the tw o types of TNF receptors. The soluble receptor forms apparently arise as a result of shedding of the extracellular domains of the receptors, and concentrations of about 1-2 25 ng/mL are found in the serum and urine of healthy subjects (Aderka e t al. (1992) Lymphokine and Cytokine Res. 3:157; Chouaib et al. (1991) Immunol, today 12:141). The levels of the soluble receptors vary from individual to individual but are stable over tim e for given individuals (Aderka e t al. (1992) Lymphokine and Cytokine Res. 3:1 57). 30 The physiological role of the soluble TNF receptors is not known. It is known that both types of soluble receptors can bind to TNF in vitro and inhibit its biological activity by com peting w ith cell surface receptors for TNF binding. WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -5- HEMORRHAGIC VIRUS DISEASES AND DISORDERS A syndrome referred to as viral hemorrhagic fever is caused by one of several RNA viruses that include members of the viral families of Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae and Flaviviridae (see, e.g., Peters et al., Textbook of 5 human virology (Belshe, ed.), Mosby Year Book, pp. 699-712 (1991)). Pronounced hemorrhage manifestations are characteristic of these fevers as well as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), generalized shock, and a high m ortality rate (30% -90% ) (Fisher-Hoch et al., J. Infect. Dis., 1 3 :887-894 (1985); Fisher-Hoch, Rev. Med. Virol., 3:7-13 (1993); Murphy et al., Virology 10 (Fields and Knipe, eds.), Raven, New York, pp. 936-942 (1990)). Despite some understanding of the progress of these diseases and responses, there are few , if any, effective treatm ents. Due to the severity and breath of viral hemorrhagic diseases and other disorders associated w ith a deleterious immune response, there is a great need 15 for effective treatm ents of such diseases, disorders and conditions. Therefore, it is an object herein to provide treatm ents for such diseases and disorders. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Methods and compositions for treating disorders and diseases involving acute inflam m atory responses are provided.

Compositions for effecting such treatm ent are also provided. Tetracycline and tetracycline-like compounds and the blood-derived compositions for effecting such treatm ent are provided herein. It is shown herein that tetracycline 15 compounds and tetracycline-like compounds as defined herein can be used for treatm ent of disorders involving acute inflam m atory responses. The tetracycline and tetracycline-like compounds are used to treat the disorders and also to produce blood product compositions from donors for the treatm ent of the disorders. The blood product compositions and the tetracycline and tetracycline- 20 like compounds can be used together or each can be used for treatm ent of these disorders. Also provided are methods of preparing blood or fractions thereof for use in preparing compositions for treatm ent of acute inflam m atory conditions, disorders and diseases, by treating the blood or fraction thereof in vitro or in vivo 25 w ith a compound that is tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound. Hence methods for preparation of blood-derived compositions for treatm ent of diseases, conditions and disorders characterized by or involving an inflamm atory immune response are provided. Methods for such production are provided. The compositions are produced either in vitro or in vivo or a combination thereof by 30 contacting blood or blood fraction or product w ith a tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compound for a sufficient tim e to result in at least about a 3-fold increase in the level of a selected cytokine receptors, such as IL-1 receptors WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 and/or TNF receptors. Hence, the level of receptors, such as IL-1 receptors and/or soluble TNF receptors, in the blood or blood fraction or product is tested before and after contacting w ith the tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound. In particular, a method for producing a cytokine-receptor-enriched blood 5 product by treating blood or a fraction thereof w ith a tetracycline or tetracycline\u00ad like compound; and harvesting by methods described herein or known to those of skill in the art, fractions thereof, and selecting the cytokine-receptor enriched plasma, serum or other fraction. The resulting compositions are enriched for cytokine receptors compared to the blood prior to treatm ent. The receptors of 10 interest include soluble tum or necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and/or interleukin- 1 RA (IL-1 RA) receptors. Contacting the blood or fraction thereof can be effected in vitro or in vivo. Hence a method for producing cytokine-receptor- enriched compositions by treating w hite blood cells in vitro w ith a tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound to induce receptor expression; and collecting 15 extracellular medium is provided. The resulting compositions and use thereof for treatm ent of conditions, diseases and disorders associated w ith acute inflam m atory responses are provided. Processes for producing compositions suitable for treating viral 20 hemorrhagic diseases or disorders are provided. These processes include some or all of the steps of: a) administering one or more tetracycline compounds to a mammal; b) collecting blood from the mammal; and c) recovering serum or plasma from the collected blood to thereby produce a composition for use in treating the disorders or diseases.

These compositions also can be used to treat any disorder involving a cytotoxic response, including but not limited to sepsis and endotoxic shock. The plasma 30 (or serum portion) may be further fractionated and fractions that possess the desired therapeutic activity (treatment of symptoms associated w ith the viral infection, shock or other such disorder) identified em pirically and form ulated, if WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -8- necessary, into compositions for treatm ent of the mammal. For humans, the plasma (or blood) is preferably derived from a human treated w ith a tetracycline compound. In particular, plasma or derivatives of the plasma produced by 5 administering a tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound, and then isolating the fraction rich in released soluble factors, such as 1 1 -1 receptors and TNF-1 receptors. The plasma fraction is for treating acute events, including the viral infections, and cardiovascular events. Hence compositions containing these soluble receptors, im m unoattenuting factors, are provided. These are produced 10 by administering a tetracycline compound or a tetracycline-like compound to induce the factors, harvesting the plasma, optionally enriching the plasma for these factors that sop up inflam m atory factors. The resulting composition is administered. Also provided are the resulting blood-derived compositions, and methods 15 of treatm ent of treating viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders and other diseases involving a cytotoxic response in which TNF or IL-1 or both or other cytokines or receptors therefor are elevated, by administering the blood-derived compositions. Also provided are methods of treatm ent of these conditions, diseases and 20 disorders (collectively referred to as conditions). The compositions are administered to a mammal w ith a condition associated w ith or characterized by an acute inflamm atory response. These compositions can be administered in combination w ith tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compounds and also optionally in combination w ith other therapies for each disorder. The 25 combination therapies may be administered simultaneously, consecutively, interm ittently or in any desired or effective order. The may be repeated as needed. Hence in certain embodiments, tetracycline and tetracycline-like compounds other related compounds and the blood-derived compositions 30 provided herein are used to treat various types viral and infectious diseases, particularly viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders, particularly those viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders caused by infection w ith a Bunyaviridaea, a WO 00/64479PCT/USOO/117O0 Filoviridae, a Flaviviridae, or an Arenaviridae virus, and other disorders, such as sepsis, particularly that associated w ith exposure to gram negative bacterial endotoxis, and shock, including that associated w ith trauma, and infections, such as parasitic infections, that are characterized by an immunologic response, 5 particularly an acute inflammatory responses, involving cellular activation, including production tumor necrosis factors, interleukins, chemokines and interferons.

DEFINITIONS Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to 5 which this invention belongs. Where permitted, all patents, applications, published applications and other publications and sequences from GenBank and other data bases referred to throughout the disclosure herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. As used herein, \"tetracycline compound\" refers any compound having the 10 activity of a tetracycline, prodrugs, salts, esters or other derivatives of tetracycline, preferably in a pharmaceutically acceptable form , known to those of skill in the art. Tetracycline, which is well known to those of skill in the art hs the structure: 20 25OHOH OH C -N H 3 O H 30 It is intended herein for the the term \"tetracycline\" to encompass all pharmaceutically active species of tetracycline compounds, solutions thereof and 35 mixtures thereof, prodrugs thereof and any drug recognized as a tetracycline. Tetracycline includes forms, such as hydrated forms, and compositions WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -16 - such as aqueous solutions, hydrolyzed products or ionized products of these compounds; and these compounds may contain different number of attached water molecules. Thus, as used herein, the term tetracycline compound encompasses all derivatives and analogs and modified forms thereof, including 5 but not limited to, those set forth herein. Tetracycline and tetracycline-like compounds include, but are as any others 10 falling w ithin the above formula. Also included among tetracycline-like compounds are compounds that alter bacterial folic acid metabolism, such as sulfa drugs, including sulfonamides, and thalidomide. Such compounds can be identified by their ability to alter bacterial folic acid metabolism. As used herein, tetracycline-like compounds, such as aureomycin, sulfa 15 drugs and thalidomide, refer to compounds that have the activity of tetracycline in the methods herein. Such compounds can be identified by their ability to alter folic acid metabolism in bacterial species, particularly those in which tetracycline alters folic acid metabolism. As shown herein, a tetracycline and tetracycline-like compound herein is 20 a compound that stimulates release of soluble factors in the blood that attenuate inflamm atory responses. Any tetracycline compound(s), when used alone or in combination w ith other compounds, that can alleviate, reduce, ameliorate, prevent, or place or maintain in a state of remission of clinical symptoms or diagnostic markers 25 associated w ith viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders, particularly those viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders caused by infection of a Bunyaviridaea, a Filoviridae, a Flaviviridae, or an Arenaviridae virus, are intended for use in the methods, compositions and combinations provided herein. As used herein, an anti-hemorrhagic virus treatm ent refers to any 30 treatm ent designed to treat hemorrhagic viral infections by lessening or ameliorating the symptoms. Treatments that prevent the infection or lessen its severity are also contemplated. An anti-hemorrhagic virus agent (used WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -17 - interchangeable w ith \"anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent\") refers any agents used in the treatment. These include any agents, when used alone or in combination with other compounds, that can alleviate, reduce, ameliorate, prevent, or place or maintain in a state of remission of clinical sym ptom s or diagnostic markers 5 associated w ith viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders, particularly those viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders caused by infection of a Bunyaviridaea, a Filoviridae, a Flaviviridae, or an Arenaviridae virus, can be used in methods, combinations and compositions provided herein. Non-limiting examples of anti\u00ad viral-hemorrhagic agents include interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors, tum or necrosis 10 factor (TNF) inhibitors, anti-viral vaccines, anti-viral antibodies, viral-activated immune cells and viral-activated immune sera. not encompass \"tetracycline compound\" or use thereof for treatm ent, but encompasses all agents and 15 treatment modalities known to those of skill in the art to ameliorate the symptoms of a hemorrhagic viral infection. As used herein, a cytokine is a factor, such as Iymphokine or monokine, that is produced by cells that affect the same or other cells. A \"cytokine\" is one of the group of molecules involved in signalling between cells during immune 20 responses. Cytokines are proteins or peptides; and some are glycoproteins. As used herein, \"interleukin (IL)\" refers to a large group of cytokines produced mainly by T cells, although some are also produced by mononuclear phagocytes, or by tissue cells. They have a variety of functions, but most of them are involved in directing other cells to divide and differentiate. Each 25 interleukin acts on specific, limited group of cells which express the correct receptors for that cytokine. As used herein, \"interleukin-1 (IL-1)\" refers to interleukins made by certain antigen presenting cells (APCs) that, along w ith IL-6, act as co\u00ad stimulatory signals for T cell activation. The IL-1 gene fam ily includes IL- , 5(6):517-522 (1994)). Each member is first synthesized as a precursor protein; the precursors for IL-1 (prolL-1o and prolL-1/ff) have molecular weights of about WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -18 - 31,000 Da. The prolL-1aand mature 17,000 Da IL -Ia a re biologically active whereas the prolL-1/? requires cleavage to a 17,000 Da peptide for optimal biological activity. The IL-IRa precursor has a leader sequence and is cleaved to its mature form and secreted like most proteins. IL- and IL-1/? are potent 5 agonists where IL-IRa is a specific receptor antagonist. Moreover, IL-IRa appears to be a pure receptor antagonist w ith no agonist activity in vitro or in vivo. Although IL-IRa is a secreted protein, there is another form of this molecule which is retained inside cells. It is called \"intracellular\" (ic) IL-1 Ra. IcIL-IRa results from alternate mRNA splice insertion of the IL-IRa gene 10 replacing the exon coding for the signal peptide. The form s of IL-IRa are functionally indistinguishable. Thus, reference, for example, to \"IL-1\" encompasses all proteins encoded by the IL-1 gene fam ily including IL-1 a, IL-1/?, IL-IRa and iclL-1Ra, or an equivalent molecule obtained from any other source or that has been prepared 15 synthetically. It is intended to encompass IL-1 w ith conservative amino acid substitutions that do not substantially alter its activity. Suitable conservative substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and may be made generally w ithout altering the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid 20 substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, e.g., Watson et aL M olecular Biology o f the Gene, 4th Edition, 1987, The Bejacmin/Cummings Pub. co., p.224). Such substitutions are preferably made in accordance w ith those set forth in TABLE 1 as follows: WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -1 9 - TABLE I Original residue Conservative substitution Ala (A) Gly; Ser Arg (R) Lys 5 Asn (N) Gin; His Cys (C) Ser Gln (Q) Asn Glu (E) Asp Gly (G) Ala; Pro 1 0 His (H) Asn; Gln He (I) Leu; Val Leu (L) He; Val (K) Arg; Gin; Glu M et (M) Leu; Tyr; He 1 5 Phe (F) Met; Leu; Tyr Ser (S) Thr Thr (T) Ser Trp (W) Tyr T y r(Y ) Trp; Phe 2 0 Val (V) He; Leu Other substitutions are also permissible and may be determined empirically or in accord w ith known conservative substitutions. As used herein, the amino acids, which occur in the various amino acid sequences appearing herein, are identified according to their w ell-know n, three- 25 letter or one-letter abbreviations. The nucleotides, which occur in the various DNA fragments, are designated w ith the standard single-letter designations used routinely in the art. As used herein, \"IL-1 inhibitor\" encompasses any substances that prevent or decrease production, post-translational modification(s), m aturation, or release 30 of IL-1, or any substances that interfere w ith or decrease the efficacy of the interaction between IL-1 (see, e.g., SEQ ID Nos. 1 and 2) and IL-1 receptor (see, e.g., SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4). Preferably, the IL-1 inhibitor is an anti-IL-1 antibody, an anti-IL-1 receptor antibody, IL-1 receptor antagonist, an IL-1 production inhibitor, an IL-1 receptor production inhibitor and an IL-1 releasing 35 inhibitor. As used regimen\", and drug WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -2 0 - therapies, including vaccines, which are known to those skilled in the art. \"Radiotherapeutic\" agents are well known in the art. As used herein, \"interleukin-1 converting enzyme (ICE)\" refers to a protease that (plL-1 ) to the mature IL-Ijff (mlL- ) 5 (U.S. Patent No. 5,552,536). ICE generates fully active m lL- by cleaving piL- 1 between Asp1 1 6 and Ala1 1 7 , a unique site for pheromone processing. The sequence around this cleavage site, -Tyr-VaI-His-Asp-AIa-, is evolutionarily conserved in all known piL-1 polypeptides. Active human ICE is a heterodimer w ith 1:1 stoichiom etric complex of p20 and p10 subunits. Cloned cDNA have 10 revealed that ICE is constitutively expressed as a 45 kDa proenzyme (p45) composed of a 14 kDa prodomain, followed by p20 which contains the active site Cys285, a 1 9 residue connecting peptide that is not present in the mature enzyme, and p10, a required component of the active enzyme. The mature subunits are flanked by Asp-X sequences. Mutational analysis of these sites and 15 expression in heterologous systems indicates that the generation of active enzyme is autocatalytic. Murine and rat ICE have also been cloned and show a high degree of sequence similarity including these structural m otifs. As used herein, \"tum or necrosis factor (TNF)\" refers to a group of proinflammatory cytokines encoded within the major histocom patibility complex 20 (MHC). TNF fam ily members include TNFo (also known as cachectin) and (also known as lymphotoxin). Complementary cDNA clones encoding TNFo (Pennica et al., Nature, 31 2 :724 (1984)) and (Gray et al., Nature, 3 1 2 :721 (1984)) have been isolated. Therefore, reference, for example, to \"TNF\" encompasses all proteins encoded by the TNF gene fam ily including TNFa and 25 , or an equivalent molecule obtained from any other source or that has been prepared synthetically. It is intended to encompass TNF w ith conservative amino acid substitutions that do not substantially alter its activity. As used herein, \"TNF inhibitor\" encompasses any substances that prevent or decrease production, post-translational modification(s), maturation, or 30 release of TNF, or any substances that interfere w ith or decrease the efficacy of the interaction between TNF (see, e.g., SEQ ID Nos. 14 and 15) and TNF receptor (see, SEQ ID Nos. 16 and 17). Preferably, the TNF inhibitor is an anti- WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -2 1 - TNF antibody, an anti-TNF receptor antibody, a TNF receptor antagonist, a TNF production inhibitor, a TNF inhibitor and a TNF releasing inhibitor. Native TNF receptors are characterized by distinct extracellular, 5 transmembrane and intracellular domains. Tw o distinct TNF receptors of about 55 kd (\"TNF-R1\") and about 75 kd (\"TNF-R2\") have been identified. Numerous studies have demonstrated that TNF-R1 is the receptor which signals the majority of the pleiotropic activities of TNF. The domain required for signaling cytotoxicity and other TNF-mediated responses has been mapped to the about 10 80 amino acids near the C-terminus of TNF-R1. This domain is therefore termed the \"death domain\" (''TNF-R death domain\" and \"TNF-R1-DD\") (see, U.S. Patent No. 5,852,173; and Tartaglia et al., Cell, 74:845 -8 53 (1993)). As used herein, \"antisense polynucleotides\" refer to synthetic sequences of nucleotide bases complementary to mRNA or the sense strand of double 15 stranded DNA. Adm ixture of sense and antisense polynucleotides under appropriate conditions leads to the binding of the tw o molecules, or hybridization. When these polynucleotides bind to (hybridize with) mRNA, inhibition of protein synthesis (translation) occurs. When these polynucleotides bind to double stranded DNA, inhibition of RNA synthesis (transcription) occurs. 20 The resulting inhibition of translation and/or transcription leads to an inhibition of the synthesis of the protein encoded by the sense strand. As used herein, an antisense oligonucleotide that contains a sufficient number of nucleotides to inhibit translation of an mRNA, such as an interleukin-1 (IL-1), such as IL-1 a, or TNF. An antisense oligonucleotide refers to any oligomer 25 that prevents production or expression of, for example, IL-1 polypeptide. The size of such an oligomer can be any length that is effective for this purpose. In general, the antisense oligomer is prepared in accordance w ith the nucleotide sequence of a portion of the transcript of interest (i.e ., 1 1 -1 or TNF) that includes the translation initiation codon and contains a sufficient number of 30 complementary nucleotides to block translation. As used herein, \"vaccine\" refers to any composition for active immunological prophylaxis. A vaccine may be used therapeutically to treat a WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -2 2 - disease, or to prevent development of a disease or to decrease the severity of a disease either proactively or after infection. Non-limiting examples of vaccines include, but are not limited to, preparations of killed microbes of virulent strains or living microbes of attenuated (variant or mutant) strains, or microbial, fungal, 5 plant, protozoa, or metazoa derivatives or products. \"Vaccine\" also encompasses protein/peptide and nucleotide based vaccines. As used herein, \"cytotoxic cells\" refers to cells that kill virally infected targets expressing antigenic peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. As used herein, \"treating hemorrhagic viral diseases or disorders\" means 10 that the diseases and the symptoms associated w ith the hemorrhagic viral diseases or disorders are alleviated, reduced, ameliorated, prevented, placed in a state of remission, or maintained in a state of remission. Additionally, as used herein, \"a method for treating hemorrhagic viral diseases or disorders\" means that the hallmarks of hemorrhagic viral diseases or disorders are eliminated, 15 reduced or prevented by the treatm ent. Non-limiting examples of the hallmarks of the viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), generalized shock, and the highest m ortality rate (30% -90% ). As used herein, a blood-derived compositions (or immune composition) refers to the composition produced from the blood of mammals treated w ith a 20 tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compound. It also refers to the compositions produced by in vitro treatm ent of blood or a blood fraction w ith a tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound. These blood-derived are for treating, not only the hemorrhagic disorders, but also for alleviating any disorder involving a deleterious immune response, such as septic shock and endotoxic shock. 25 The immune response to certain infectious agents, such as viruses, parasites and bacteria, and in certain diseases and conditions, activate cells and products thereof that have deleterious consequences. For example, LPS (IipopoIysaccharide) binds to immunoglobin M and this complex activates the complement system w ith the release of C3b, w hich material in neutrophils, cells. The of these substances stimulates the release of several mediators of septic shock including tum or necrosis factor (TNF-) WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -2 3 - interleukin-1 (IL-1) prostaglandins and (see, e .g ., (1 9 9 1 ) Ann. Intern. Med. 1 1 5 : 464-466 for a more comprehensive listing). Of these, the tw o cytokines TNF- and IL-1 lead to many of the physiologic 5 changes which eventuate into septic shock. As used herein, an acute inflam m atory disease, condition or disorder, refers to any condition, disease or disorder in which a deleterious elevation of cytokines and other inflamm atory mediators occurs. For purposes herein, disease, condition and disorder refer to the manifestation of such elevation. In 10 general a disease is caused by an infectious agent, a disorder refers to a disease that does not have a known infectious agent as a cause and a condition is used to capture all such symptoms and characteristics associated w ith acute inflam m atory responses. They are referred to herein in the alternative to ensure that all are encompassed. 15 As used herein, \"serum\" refers to the fluid portion of the blood obtained after removal of the fibrin clot and blood cells, distinguished from the plasma in circulating blood. As used herein, \"plasma\" refers to the fluid, noncellular portion of the blood, distinguished from the serum obtained after coagulation. 20 As used herein, \"albumin\" refers to a type of protein, varieties of which are widely distributed throughout the tissues and fluids of plants and animals, especially animal blood. Albumin are soluble in pure water, precipitable from solution by strong acids and coagulable by heat in acid or neutral solution. As used herein, \"globulin\" refers to a fam ily of proteins precipitated from 25 plasma (or serum) by half-saturation w ith ammonium sulfate. Globulin may be further fractionated by solubility, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and other separation methods into many subgroups, the main groups being -, -, and y- globulins. As used herein, \"antihemophilic factor (AHF)\" refers the fraction of blood 30 that contains Factor V lll and/or von W illebrand's factor, which are im portant in the blood clotting mechanism (see, e.gr.,,U.S. Patent No. 4 ,4 3 5 ,3 1 8 ). Factor V lll serves as a co-factor along w ith calcium and phospholipid to enable Factor IXa to WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -2 4 - cleave zymogen Factor X to thus activate Factor X, all being a part of the complex coagulation cascade system. Von W illebrand's factor (vWF) apparently acts in the aggregation of platelets which provide the necessary phospholipid. The absence of either of these factors may result in prolonged bleeding times. 5 Factor V also serves an im portant role in the coagulation system by aiding activated Factor X in the cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin. (The Plasma Proteins, Vol. Ill, 2nd Ed., Structure, Function, Genetic Control (1977) (Academic Press, Inc., N.Y.) p. 422-544.) As used herein, an effective amount of a compound for treating a 10 particular disease is an amount that is sufficient to ameliorate, or in some manner reduce the symptoms associated w ith the disease. Such amount may be administered as a single dosage or may be administered according to a regimen, whereby it is effective. The amount may cure the disease but, typically, is administered in order to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease. 15 Repeated administration may be required to achieve the desired amelioration of symptoms. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters or other derivatives of the conjugates include any salts, esters or derivatives that may be readily prepared by those of skill in this art using known methods for such 20 derivatization and that produce compounds that may be administered to animals or humans w ithout substantial toxic effects and that either are pharmaceutically active or are prodrugs. As used herein, treatm ent means any manner in which the symptoms of a conditions, disorder or disease are ameliorated or otherwise 25 beneficially altered. Treatment also encompasses any pharmaceutical use of the compositions herein. As used herein, amelioration of the sym ptoms of a particular disorder by administration of a particular pharmaceutical composition refers to any lessening, whether permanent or temporary, lasting or transient that can be attributed to or 30 associated w ith adm inistration of the composition. As used herein, substantially pure means sufficiently homogeneous to appear free of readily detectable impurities as determined by standard methods WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -2 5 - of analysis, such as thin layer chromatography (TLC), gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), used by those of skill in the art to assess such purity, or sufficiently pure such that further purification would not detectably alter the physical and chemical properties, such as enzymatic and 5 biological activities, of the substance. Methods for purification of the compounds to produce substantially chemically pure compounds are known to those of skill in the art. A substantially chemically pure compound may, however, be a mixture of stereoisomers or isomers. In such instances, further purification might increase the specific activity of the compound. 10 As used herein, a prodrug is a compound that, upon in vivo administration, is metabolized or otherwise converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, the pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated by metabolic processes. The prodrug may be 15 designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism In vivo , those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of 20 the compound (see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392). As used herein, biological activity refers to the in vivo activities of a compound or physiological responses that result upon in vivo administration of a compound, composition or other mixture. Biological activity, thus, encompasses 25 therapeutic effects and pharmaceutical activity of such compounds, compositions and mixtures. Biological activities may be observed in in vitro systems designed to test or use such activities. Thus, for purposes herein the biological activity of a Iuciferase is its oxygenase activity whereby, upon oxidation of a substrate, light is produced. WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -2 6 - As used herein, a receptor refers to a molecule that has an affinity for a given ligand. Receptors may be naturally-occurring or synthetic molecules. Receptors may also be referred to in the art as anti-ligands. As used herein, the receptor and anti-ligand are interchangeable. Receptors can be used in their 5 unaltered state or as aggregates w ith other species. Receptors may be attached, covalently or noncovalently, or in physical contact w ith, to a binding member, either directly or indirectly via a specific binding substance or linker. Examples of receptors, include, but are not limited to: antibodies, cell membrane receptors surface receptors and internalizing receptors, monoclonal antibodies and antisera 10 reactive w ith specific antigenic determinants [such as on viruses, cells, or other polynucleotides, nucleic acids, peptides, cofactors, lectins, sugars, polysaccharides, cells, cellular membranes, and organelles. Examples of receptors and applications using such receptors, include but are not restricted to: 15 a) enzymes: specific transport proteins or enzymes essential to survival of microorganisms, which could serve as targets for antibiotic [ligand] selection; b) antibodies: identification of a ligand-binding site on the antibody molecule that combines w ith the epitope of an antigen of interest may be investigated; determination of a sequence that mimics an antigenic epitope may 20 lead to the development of vaccines of which the immunogen is based on one or more of such sequences or lead to the development of related diagnostic agents or compounds useful in therapeutic treatm ents such as for auto-immune diseases c) nucleic acids: identification of ligand, such as protein or RNA, binding sites; 25 d) catalytic polypeptides: polymers, preferably polypeptides, that are capable of promoting a chemical reaction involving the conversion of one or more reactants to one or more products; such polypeptides generally include a binding site specific for at least one reactant or reaction intermediate and an active functionality proximate to the binding site, in which the functionality is 30 capable of chemically modifying the bound reactant [see, e.g.. U.S. Patent No. 5,215,89 9]; WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -2 7 - e) hormone receptors: determination of the ligands that bind w ith high affinity to a receptor is useful in the development of hormone replacement therapies; for example, identification of ligands that bind to such receptors may lead to the development of drugs to control blood pressure; and 5 f) opiate receptors: determination of ligands that bind to the opiate receptors in the brain is useful in the development of less-addictive replacements for morphine and related drugs. As used herein, antibody includes antibody fragments, such as Fab fragments, which are composed of a light chain and the variable region of a 10 heavy chain. As used herein, humanized antibodies refer to antibodies that are modified to include \"human\" sequences of amino acids so that administration to a human will not provoke an immune response. Methods for preparation of such antibodies are known. For example, the hybridoma that expresses the 15 monoclonal antibody is altered by recombinant DNA techniques to express an antibody in which the amino acid composition of the non-variable regions is based on human antibodies. Computer programs have been designed to identify such regions. As used herein, production by recombinant means by using recombinant 20 DNA methods means the use of the well known methods of molecular biology for expressing proteins encoded by cloned DNA. As used herein, substantially identical to a product means sufficiently similar so that the property of interest is sufficiently unchanged so that the substantially identical product can be used in place of the product. 25 As used herein equivalent, when referring to tw o sequences of nucleic acids means that the tw o sequences in question encode the same sequence of amino acids or equivalent proteins. When \"equivalent\" is used in referring to tw o proteins or peptides, it means th a t the tw o proteins or peptides have substantially the same amino acid sequence w ith only conservative amino acid 30 substitutions (see, e.g.. Table 1, above)that do not substantially alter the activity or function of the protein or peptide. When \"equivalent\" refers to a property, the property does not need to be present to the same extent [e.g.. tw o peptides WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -28 - can exhibit different rates of the same type of enzymatic activity], but the activities are preferably substantially the same. \"Com plem entary,\" when referring to tw o nucleotide sequences, means that the tw o sequences of nucleotides are capable of hybridizing, preferably w ith less than 25% , more 5 preferably w ith less than 15% , even more preferably w ith less than 5% , most preferably w ith no mismatches between opposed nucleotides. Preferably the tw o molecules w ill hybridize under conditions of high stringency. As used herein: stringency of hybridization in determining percentage mismatch is as follow s: 10 1) high stringency: 0.1 x SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 65\u00b0C 2) medium stringency: 0.2 x SSPE, 0.1 % SDS, 50\u00b0C 3) low stringency: 1.0 x SSPE, 0.1 % SDS, 50\u00b0C It is understood that equivalent stringencies may be achieved using alternative buffers, salts and temperatures. 15 The term \"substantially\" identical or homologous or similar varies w ith the context as understood by those skilled in the relevant art and generally means at least 70% , preferably means at least 80% , more preferably at least 90% , and most preferably at least 95% identity. As used herein, a composition refers to a any mixture. It may be a 20 solution, a suspension, liquid, powder, a paste, aqueous, non-aqueous or any combination thereof. As used herein, a combination refers to any association between tw o or among more items. As used herein, fluid refers to any composition that can flow . Fluids thus 25 encompass compositions that are in the form of semi-solids, pastes, solutions, aqueous mixtures, gels, lotions, creams and other such compositions. As used herein, the abbreviations for any protective groups, amino acids and other compounds, are, unless indicated otherwise, in accord w ith their common usage, recognized abbreviations, or the IUPAC-IUB Commission on 30 Biochemical Nomenclature (see, (1972) Biochem. 11:1 726). WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -2 9 - For clarity of disclosure, and not by way of lim itation, the detailed description is divided into the subsections that follow . The description below is exemplified by reference viral hemorrhagic diseases. It is understood that the methods, compositions, combinations and kits provided 5 and described herein may be used for treatm ent of any disorder, disease or condition characterized by a deleterious immune response. Such diseases, conditions and disorders include, but are not limited to: viral infections, such as viral hemorrhagic infections, Ientivirus infections, HIV infections, herpesvirus infections; bacterial infections, particularly infection w ith pathogenic strains of E. 10 coli and Streptococcus, viruses associated w ith sleep disorders, such as HIV; parasitic infections, such as malaria, autoimmune diseases, such a thyroid diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupis; sepsis; cachexia, such as the wasting associated w ith HIV infection and cancer; rheumatoid arthritis; chronic myelogenous leukemia and sclerosis; cell death associated w ith apoptosis; thyroid diseases and other endocrine disorders in which TNF or IL-1 is implicated or is a mediator; gynecological disorders, including endometriosis and infections associated therew ith; and other diseases 20 mediated by or associated w ith IL-1 and/or TNF. It is also understood that IL-1 and TNF expression serve as markers for these disorders and to monitor the treatm ents herein and the blood compositions herein, but that these inflammatory response compounds are not necessarily the only agents involved. B. COMBINATIONS AND KITS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATMENT OF 25 ACUTE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES Combinations of therapeutic agents and also compositions for treatm ent of acute inflam m atory responses are provided herein. Several embodiments are provided. In one embodiment, blood-derived compositions, described below, are 30 provided. These compositions are produced by contacting mammalian blood or a fraction thereof, in vitro or in vivo, w ith one or more tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compounds, as defined herein, to induce a response that is WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -3 0 - assessed by monitoring the increase in level of TNF receptors and/or IL-1 receptors. The amount of compound contacted w ith the blood and time of contact is sufficient to induce at least a three-fold increase from baseline, which is variable from individual-to-individual and species-to-species, of TNF and/or IL-I 5 receptors. The total increase of either must be at least about three-fold to ensure a sufficient concentration of the receptors and other factors in the blood or fraction thereof. The resulting blood or fraction thereof can be further fractionated, such that the selected fraction retains the activity of the original blood, such as against hemorrhagic factors, and is then administered to recipient 10 mammal, that is preferably,species and blood type matched to the donated blood or fraction. The blood or fraction thereof can be stored, preferably at about - 70\u00b0 C or under other conditions appropriate for storage of blood products, but is preferably not freeze-dried. The blood product may also be administered to the recipient in 15 combination w ith a tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compound. Such administration can be simultaneous or sequential. If administered separately they should be administered w ithin 24 hours, preferably w ithin 6 hours. When administered simultaneously they can be administered in a single composition, w ith the tetracycline and tetracycline-like compound(s) mixed in the blood- 20 derived compositions. They blood-derived composition is preferably administered intravenously or intraperitoneally; the tetracycline and tetracycline\u00ad like compound is preferably administered orally. Multiple doses of each may be administered as needed. Precise dosage and regimen can be empirically determined. 25 The combination therapy may also include a known therapeutic treatm ent or regimen for a particular acute inflam m atory disease, condition or disorder. Hence combinations of the blood-derived (or immune) compositions w ith tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compounds are provided; combinations of the blood-derived (or immune) compositions w ith other therapeutic agents for 30 treatm ent of a particular disorder, and combinations of the blood-derived (or immune) compositions w ith tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compounds and w ith other therapeutic agents are provided. The component of combinations WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -3 1 - may be provided as separate compositions or may be provided as mixtures of tw o or more compositions. The tetracycline and tetracycline-like compounds are preferably administered orally and the blood-derived compositions are preferably administered by IV. 5 Kits containing the combinations are provided. The kits contain the components of the combinations, such as the blood-derived composition and tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compounds, and optionally include instructions for administration to treat acute inflam m atory response disorders.

HEMORRHAGIC VIRUSES AND THE IMMUNE RESPONSE The immune response to hemorrhagic viral infection appears to follow the a scheme that includes: viral activation of macrophages, T and B lymphocytes; production of mediators by mononuclear cells, including cytokines such as, 5 interleukin (IL)-I and IL-2, interferon (IFN), and/or tum or necrosis factor (TNF); changes of the proliferative activity of the cells; alterations of lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4 and CD8); and propagation of virus in immunocompetent cells. A decrease of lymphocyte proliferative activity in response to mitogen 10 stimulation, a decrease of the number of T and B lymphocytes, and an inversion of CD4\\CD8 lymphocyte ratios (Fisher-Hoch et al., J. Infect. Dis., 1 Vallegos et Microbiol. Immunol., 1 7 5 :1 73-1 76 (1986)) have been demonstrated in arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers. 15 Clinical observations and experimental study of these fevers has demonstrated a marked production of the inflam m atory cytokines, such as TNF, IL -I, IFN, during these diseases. Pronounced production of serum IFN was seen during experimental infection of guinea pigs and monkeys w ith Marburg and Ebola viruses w ith lethal outcome (Ignatyev et al., Voprosy Virusologii, 39:13-1 0 3 (1995); Ignatyev et al., J. BiotechnoL, 44:111-118 (1996)). The infection of human macrophages with Marburg virus leads to increased release of TNF-, which is one of several cytokines typically secreted by macrophages (Feldmann et al., J. Virol., 70:220 8-2214 (1996)). Infection of monkeys w ith Ebola virus was also 25 accompanied by increased serum TNF- levels (Ignatyev, Curr. Top. levels of TNFa and IFN- in patients w ith Argentine hemorrhagic fever correlate w ith the severity of disease; whereas IL-1/? levels in patients do not differ from those in normal controls (see, Heller et al., J. infect. 30 Dis., 1 6 6 :1 203 (1992)). Increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in patients w ith hemorrhagic fever w ith renal syndrome has been reported (Linderholm et al., infection, 24:337-340 (1996)). Similarly high concentrations of IL-1 WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -4 2 - and TNF during the development of the human septic shock are known to contribute to lethal outcome (see, Calandra et al., J. Infectious Diseases, 161:982-987 (1990); Cannon et al., J. Infectious Diseases, 1 6 1 :79-84 (1990)). Defective humoral responses and extensive intravascular apoptosis are 5 associated w ith fatal outcome in ebola virus-infected patients (Baize et al., Nature Medicine, 5(4):423-426 (1999)). In survivors, early and increasing levels of IgG, directly against mainly against the nucleoprotein and the 40-Kda viral protein, were followed by clearance of circulating viral antigen and activation of cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, fatal infection was characterized by impaired 10 humoral responses, w ith absent specific IgG and barely detectable IgM. The compositions and method provided herein provide a means to treat infections w ith hemorrhagic viruses. In particular, the blood-derived compositions, which can be readily produced by contacting blood from a donor in vitro or in vivo w ith a tetracycline and tetracycline-like compound, and then 15 harvesting, preferably serum or plasma, which can be infused into the mammal w ith the infection, is effective for treatm ent. The response in the donor blood or fraction thereof can be observed as quickly as six hours after administration of the tetracycline and tetracycline-like compound or contacting w ith the blood. The infected mammal can also be treated w ith a tetracycline and tetracycline-like 20 compounds prior to administration of the blood-derived composition, simultaneously and/or subsequently. Additional anti-hemorrhagic viral treatm ents and agents may also be administered. D. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS, FORMULATION AND MODES OF ADMINISTRATION THEREOF 25 Blood-derived compositions for administration, preferably for systemic administration, for treatm ent of acute inflam m atory responses are provided. These are preferably provided in a form for systemic, such as intraperitoneal or intravenous administration. They may be concentrated or diluted by standard methods; preferably they are not subjected to freeze-drying. 30 Combinations of the blood-derived compositions w ith tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compounds are also provided. These combinations may be WO 00/64479 PCT/USO0/11700 -4 3 - packaged as kits and are intended for treatm ent of the acute inflammatory responses. Also provided for treatm ent of the viral hemorrhagic diseases and also bacterial infections, such as E. coli, are tetracycline and tetracycline-like 5 compounds, and also combinations of a composition containing one or more tetracycline compound(s) and a composition containing an anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent, preferably in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The tetracycline compound(s) and anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent are packaged as separate compositions for administration together or sequentially or 10 interm ittently. Alternatively, they can be contained in a single composition for administration as a single composition. The combinations can be packaged as kits. In a preferred embodiment, a composition suitable for oral delivery, includes one or more tetracycline compounds and an anti-viral-hemorrhagic 15 agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient in tablet, capsule, or other single unit dosage form is provided. Any tetracycline and tetracycline-like compound(s), including those described herein, when used alone or in combination w ith other compounds, that can alleviate, reduce, ameliorate, prevent, or place or maintain in a state of 20 remission of clinical symptoms or diagnostic markers associated w ith acute inflammatory responses, such as viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders, particularly those viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders caused by infection of a Bunyaviridaea, a Filoviridae, a Flaviviridae, or an Arenaviridae virus, can be used in the present combinations. 25 Suitable anti-viral hemorrhagic agents are described in the following section. 1 .

Formulation and routes of administration 20 The compounds, blood-derived compositions and agents are preferably formulated as pharmaceutical compositions, preferably for single dosage administration. The concentrations of the compounds in the formulations or the protein concentration of the blood-derived com position are selected to be effective for delivery of an amount, upon adm inistration, that is effective for the 25 intended treatm ent. Typically, the compositions are form ulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition, the weight fraction of a compound or mixture thereof is dissolved, suspended, dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is 30 relieved or ameliorated. Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -5 5 - known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. Effective concentration of the blood-derived compositions can be empirically determined. Plasma and serum may be administered w ith out further 5 processing or processed according to known methods. In addition, the compounds may be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or may be combined w ith other active ingredients. Liposomal suspensions, including tissue-targeted liposomes, may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These 10 may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, liposome formulations may be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 4 ,52 2 ,8 1 1 . The active compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful e ffe ct in the 15 absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may be determined empirically by testing the compounds in known in vitro and in vivo systems, such as the assays provided herein. The concentration of active compound in the drug com position will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the active compound, 20 the physicochemical characteristics of the compound, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. Typically a therapeutically effective dosage The amounts administered may be on the order of 0.001 to 1 mg/ml, preferably about 0 .005- 0.05 mg/ml, more preferably about 0.01 mg/ml, of blood volume Pharmaceutical dosage 25 unit forms are prepared to provide from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg and preferably from about 10 to about 500 mg, more preferably about 25-75 mg of the essential active ingredient or a combination of essential ingredients per dosage unit form . The precise dosage can be empirically determined. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into 30 a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of tim e. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatm ent is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -56 - protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary w ith the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over tim e according to the 5 individual need and the professional judgm ent of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to lim it the scope or use of the claimed compositions and combinations containing them. Preferred pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include acids, salts, 10 esters, hydrates, solvates and prodrug form s. The derivative is typically selected such that its pharmacokinetic properties are superior to the corresponding neutral compound. Thus, effective concentrations or amounts of one or more of the compounds provided herein or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof 15 are mixed w ith a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle for systemic, topical or local administration to form pharmaceutical compositions. Compounds are included in an amount effective fo r ameliorating or treating the disorder for which treatm ent is contemplated. The concentration of active compound in the composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, excretion rates of the active 20 compound, the dosage schedule, amount administered, particular form ulation as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can include any of the follow ing components: a sterile diluent, such as w ater for injection, saline solution, fixed oil, polyethylene glycol, 25 glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvent; antimicrobial agents, such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens; antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite; chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers, such as acetates, citrates and phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. Parenteral 30 preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or single or multiple dose vials made of glass, plastic or other suitable material. WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -57 - In instances in which the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility, methods for solubilizing compounds may be used. Such methods are known to those of skill in this art, and include, but are not limited to, using cosolvents, such as dim ethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using surfactants, such as Tween\u00ae, or 5 dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of the compounds, such as prodrugs of the compounds may also be used in form ulating effective pharmaceutical compositions. For ophthalmic indications, the compositions are form ulated in an ophthalmically acceptable carrier. For the ophthalmic uses herein, local administration, either 10 by topical administration or by injection is preferred. Time release formulations are also desirable. Typically, the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration, so that a single dose administers an effective amount. Upon mixing or addition of the compound w ith the vehicle, the resulting 15 mixture may be a solution, suspension, emulsion or other composition. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. If necessary, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or other derivatives of the compounds may be prepared. 20 The compound is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. It is understood that number and degree of side effects depends upon the condition for which the compounds are administered. For example, certain toxic and undesirable side effects are 25 tolerated when treating life-threatening illnesses that would not be tolerated when treating disorders of lesser consequence. The concentration of compound in the composition will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates thereof, the dosage schedule, and amount administered as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. 30 The compounds can also be mixed w ith other active materials, that do not impair the desired action, or w ith materials that supplement the desired action, such as cardiovascular drugs, antibiotics, anticoagulants and other such WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -58 - agents known to those of skill in the art for treating hemorrhagic viral infections, shock, infection, trauma and other disorders for which the treatm ents provided herein are contemplated. Upon mixing or addition of the compound(s), the resulting mixture may be 5 a solution, suspension, emulsion or the like. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition treated and may be empirically determined. 10 The formulations of the compounds and agents for use herein include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, inhalational, transdermal administration or any route. The most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on 15 the nature of the particular active compound which is being used. The form ulations are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage form s, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, and oral solutions or suspensions, and oil-water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the compounds or 20 pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. The pharmaceutically therapeutically active compounds and derivatives thereof are typically formulated and administered in unit-dosage forms or multiple-dosage forms. Unit-dose forms as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose 25 contains a predetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association w ith the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit-dose forms include ampoules and syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. Unit-dose form s may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A 30 multiple-dose form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dose form. Examples of multiple-dose forms include vials, bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of WO 00/64479PCT/USOO/11700 -5 9 - pints or gallons. Hence, multiple dose form is a multiple of unit-doses which are not segregated in packaging. The composition can contain along w ith the active ingredient: a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, or carboxymethylcellulose; a 5 lubricant, such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and talc; and a binder such as starch, natural gums, such as gum acaciagelatin, glucose, molasses, polvinylpyrrolidine, celluloses and derivatives thereof, povidone, crospovidones and other such binders known to those of skill in the art. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable com positions can, for example, be prepared by 10 dissolving, dispersing, or otherwise mixing an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances 15 such as w etting agents, emulsifying agents, or solubilizing agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, acetate, sodium citrate, cyclodextrine derivatives, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, and other such agents. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or w ill be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for 20 example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 15th Edition, 1975. The composition or form ulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound in an amount sufficient to alleviate the sym ptoms of the treated subject. Dosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 25 0.005% to 100% w ith the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared. For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talcum , cellulose derivatives, crosscarmellose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate or sodium saccharin. Such compositions include solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, powders and sustained release form ulations, such as, but not limited to, implants and WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -6 0 - microencapsulated delivery systems, and biodegradable, biocompatible polymers, such as collagen, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and others. Methods for preparation of these formulations are known to those skilled in the art. 5 For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means w ith pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents {e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants glycolate); or w etting agents {e.g., sodium Iauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well- known in the art. The pharmaceutical preparation may also be in liquid form, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or may be presented as a drug 15 product for reconstitution w ith w ater or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means w ith pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents {e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible {e.g., lecithin or acacia); preservatives {e.g., methyl or propyl-p- hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound w ith one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa 25 butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture. Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin or to the eye preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which may be used include vaseline, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, and combinations of tw o or more thereof. The topical 30 formulations may further advantageously contain 0.05 to 1 5 percent by weight of thickeners selected from among hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, poly/hydroxyalkyl, (meth)acrylates or poly(meth)acrylamides. The topical formulations is most often applied by instillation or as an ointm ent into the conjunctival sac. It, however, can also be used for irrigation or lubrication of the eye, facial sinuses, and external auditory meatus. It may also be injected into 5 the anterior eye chamber and other places. The topical form ulations in the liquid state may be also present in a hydrophilic three-dimensional polymer matrix in the form of a strip, contact lens, and the like from which the active components are released. For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use herein can be 10 delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, w ith the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and 15 cartridges of, e.g. , gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Formulations suitable for buccal (sublingual) administration include lozenges containing the active compound in a flavored base, usually sucrose and 20 acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles containing the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. The compounds may be form ulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form , e.g., in ampules or in multi-dose 25 containers, w ith an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain form ulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution w ith a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free w ater or other 30 solvents, before use. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact w ith the epidermis of the WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -62 - recipient for a prolonged period of tim e. Such patches suitably contain the active compound as an optionally buffered aqueous solution of, for example, 0.1 to 0.2M concentration w ith respect to the said active compound. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by iontophoresis 5 (see, e.g., Pharmaceutical Research 3 (6), 318 (1986)) and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the pharmaceutical compositions may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 10 3,536,80 9; 3,598,12 3; 3,630,20 0; 3,845,77 7 ,7 7 0 ; 3,91 6 ,8 9 9 ; 4,008,71 9; 4 ,6 8 7 ,6 1 0 ; 4 ,7 6 9 ,0 2 7 ; 5,059,59 5; 5 ,0 7 3 ,5 4 3 ,5 6 6 . Also provided are combinations for carrying out the therapeutic regimens. Such combinations, which may be packaged in the form of kits, contain one or 15 more containers w ith therapeutically effective amounts of one or more tetracy\u00ad cline compounds and an anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent, in pharmaceutically . The tetracycline compounds and the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent, either separately or in a mixture, may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable solution, e.g., in combination w ith sterile saline, dextrose solution, or 20 buffered solution, or other pharmaceutically acceptable sterile fluid. Alternatively, the tetracycline compound and the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent, either separately or in a mixture, may be Iyophilized or desiccated; in this instance, the kit optionally further comprises in a container a pharmaceutically acceptable solution (e.g., saline, dextrose solution, etc.), preferably sterile, to 25 reconstitute the tetracycline compound and the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent to form a solution for injection purposes. In another embodiment, a kit further comprises a needle or syringe, preferably packaged in sterile form , for injecting the complex, and/or a packaged alcohol pad. Instructions are optionally included for adm inistration of the tetra- 30 cycline compound and the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent by a clinician or by the patient. WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -6 3 - The magnitude of a therapeutic dose of the tetracycline compound(s), alone or in combination w ith the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent w ill vary w ith the severity of the condition to be treated and the route of adm inistration. The dose, and perhaps dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body 5 weight, condition and response of the individual patient. Dosage and administration may be empirically determined. Desirable blood levels may be maintained by a continuous infusion of the tetracycline compound(s) and/or the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent as ascertained by plasma levels. It should be noted that the attending physician would know 10 how to and when to terminate, interrupt or adjust therapy to lower dosage due to toxicity, or bone marrow, liver or kidney dysfunctions. Conversely, the attending physician would also know how to and when to adjust treatm ent to higher levels if the clinical response is not adequate (precluding toxic side effects). 15 The efficacy and/or to xicity of the tetracycline compound(s), alone or in combination w ith the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent can also be assessed by the methods known in the art, i.e., in animal models and/or clinical studies. For example, the efficacy and/or to xicity can be assessed in the animal models described in the following literatures: Huggins et al., J. Infect. Dis., 20 1 79(Supp1 ):S240-247 (1999) (ebola virus Ieathal mouse model); Lupton et al., Lancet, 2 (820 7):1 294-5 (1980) (ebola virus guineapig model); Johnson et Virol., 73(1):783-786 (1999) (dengue virus mouse model); Campetella et 6(4):443-51 (1988) (Junin virus murine model); (1985) (Junin virus al., Medicina (B Aires), 3 8 (5 ):603-4 (1978) (experimental model in Argentinean hemorrhagic fever). Any suitable route of adm inistration may be employed for providing the 30 patient w ith an effective dosage of the tetracycline compound(s), alone or in combination w ith the - and the like) may be employed. Dosage form s include tablets, troches, cachet, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, patches, and the like. (See, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences ). The active compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may be 5 prepared w ith carriers that protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as tim e release form ulations or coatings. Finally, the compounds may be packaged as articles of manufacture containing packaging material, a compound or suitable derivative thereof provided herein, which is effective for treatm ent of a viral hemorrhagic disease, 10 within the packaging material, and a label that indicates that the compound or a suitable derivative thereof is for treating hemorrhagic diseases or shock or other disorder contemplated herein. The label can optionally include the disorders for which the therapy is warranted. E. BLOOD-DERIVED COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF TREATMENT 15 1. Blood-derived compositions and processes for producing compositions for treating diseases and disorders characterized by or associated with acute inflammatory responses Also provided herein, are methods for preparing blood-derived compositions for treatm ent of the diseases and disorders characterized by or 20 associated w ith acute inflam m atory responses. The diseases and disorders contemplated herein include, but are not limited to, the viral hemmorrhagic fevers, bacterial sepsis, viral hemorrhagic diseases as well as any disorder involving a cytotoxic immune response, including, but not limited to sepsis, sepsis, cachexia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic myelogenous leukemia and 25 transplanted bone marrow-induced graft-versus-host disease, septic shock, immune complex-induced colitis, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation, autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis and other such disorders that involve release of inflammatory response mediators, including tum or necrosis factor (TNF) interleukins, particularly IL-1, other factor (PAF), and Ieukotrienes (see, e.g., (1 9 9 1 ) Ann. Intern. Med. 1 1 5 : 464-466 for a more comprehensive listing). WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -65 - Processes for producing these compositions are provided. The compositions are produced by contacting biood or fraction thereof either in vitro or in vivo w ith one or more tetracycline or tetracycline-like compounds in an sufficient amount and for a sufficient tim e to an produce a response that is 5 assessed by measuring the level of IL-1 and/or TNF receptors, using any standard assay, and looking for about a 3-fold or greater increase. The resulting blood or composition can be processed further or injected, preferably into a species and blood-type matched mammalian recipient. Further processing can be used to isolate fractions thereof that exhibit the 10 anti-inflammatory properties of the unfractionated properties. Fractions include, but are not limited to, the y-globuline fraction, the AFIF (anti-hemophilia factor, the albumin fraction, serum and plasma. Each fraction can be tested in model systems, such as those exemplified herein (see EXAMPLES) to identify active fractions. In addition or alternatively, fractions of interest are those that contain 15 TNF and/or IL-1 receptors. The TNF and IL-1 receptors serve as indicators of the fractions of interest which contain other components th a t may contribute to the observed effectiveness of the blood-derived fractions in treating the acute inflammatory disorders. In one embodiment, the process includes the steps of administering one 20 or more tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound(s) to a mammal; b) collecting blood from the mammal; and c) recovering serum or plasma from the collected blood. Before step a) the baseline level of an indicator of stim ulation is obtained. Preferably the level of IL-1 or TNF receptors is assessed, although the level of other cytokines and receptors, such as 11-16 (LCF - chem otactic for CD4, T- 25 lymphocytes), or IL-2 receptors, is assessed using standard methods (i.e., R&D Systems, makes a variety of reagents to test for interleukins and receptors therefor). In some instances and for certain diseases, cells that produce particular factors may be identified, and those cells stim ulated in vitro or in vivo to produce compositions for treatm ent of those diseases. 30 The resulting recovered serum and plasma can be used to administer to mammals exhibiting an acute inflamm atory response, such as that associated w ith infection w ith a hemorrhagic virus or otherwise exhibiting symptoms of a WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -6 6 - septic reaction, such as shock, and the other disorders enumerated herein or known to involve a deleterious inflamm atory response. The plasma or serum can be further fractionated and tested in model systems to identify active fractions. Any tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound provided herein or 5 known to those of skill in the art is contemplated for use. For in vitro preparation, blood or a fraction thereof is contacted w ith a tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound(s) or other agent, such as a virus, for time sufficient to observe at least a three-fold increase from baseline in the level of TNF or IL-1 receptors. The medium from the blood or fraction is isolated and 10 further processed, such as by further fractionation, or concentration, and then it is administered to a mammal w ith an acute inflamm atory disease, condition or disorder. In one embodiment, w hite cells are harvested from the buffy coat of blood. The cells are treated, for example w ith Sendei virus to stimulate 15 production of -interferon, and the supernatant or medium from the cells is isolated. Any process whereby TNF, or IL-1 receptors can be generated, in vitro or in vivo can be used, and the resulting blood product or a derivative thereof administered. a. Preparation of Serum and Plasma 20 Serum or plasma can be recovered from the collected blood by any methods known in the art. In one specific embodiment, the serum or plasma is recovered from the collected blood by centrifugation. Preferably, the centrifugation is conducted in the presence of a sealant having a specific gravity greater than that of the serum or plasma and less than that of the blood 25 corpuscles which will form the lower, whereby upon centrifugation, the sealant forms a separator between the upper serum or plasma layer and the lower blood corpuscle layer. The sealants that can be used in the processes include, but are limited to, styrene resin powders (Japanese Patent Publication No. 388 41/1973 ), pellets or plates of a hydrogel of a crosslinked polymer of 2- 30 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or acrylamide (U.S. Patent No. 3,647,07 0), beads of polystyrene bearing an antithrombus agent or a w etting agent on the surfaces (U.S. Patent No. 3,464,890) and a silicone fluid (U.S. Patent Nos. 3,852,19 4 WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -6 7 - and 3,780,935). In a preferred embodiment, the sealant is a polymer unsubstituted alkyl methacrylates, the alkyl moiety having not more than 18 carbon atoms, the polymer material having a specific gravity of about 1.03 to 1.08 and a viscosity of about 5,000 to 5 1,000,000 cps at a shearing speed of about 1 second 1 when measured at about 25\u00b0C (U.S. Patent No. 4,140,631). In another specific embodiment, the serum or plasma is recovered from the collected blood by filtration. Preferably, the blood is filtered through a layer of glass fibers w ith an average diameter of about 0.2 to 5 and a density of 10 about 0.1 to 0.5 g./cm 3, the total volume of the plasma or serum to be separated being at most about 50% of the absorption volume of the glass fiber layer; and collecting the run-through from the glass fiber layer which is plasma or serum (U.S. Patent No. 4,477,57 5). Also preferably, the blood is filtered through a layer of glass fibers having an average diameter 0.5 to 2.5 15 impregnated w ith a polyacrylic ester derivative and polyethylene glycol (U.S. Patent No. 5,364,533). the and (c) polyethylene glycol are used in admixture at a ratio of (10-12):(1-4):(1-4). In 20 still another specific embodiment, the serum or plasma is recovered from the collected blood by treating the blood w ith a coagulant containing a Iignan skelton having oxygen-containing side chains or rings (U.S. Patent No. 4,803,15 3). Preferably, the coagulant comprises a Iignan skelton having the coagulant 30 is used in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to 50 g per 1 I of the blood. WO 00/64479 PCT/USOO/11700 -6 8 - b. Further Fractionation of Plasma Blood plasma or sera can be further separated into different fractions, including, inter alia, an albumin-containing fraction, a globulin-containing fraction and an AHF-containing fraction. Methods for preparing these fractions are 5 known in the arts. Generally, these methods comprise one or more of the following procedures: (a) fractional precipitation w ith ammonium sulfate and similar salts; (b) organic solvent precipitation w ith cold ethanol or acetone and other such alcohols and ketones; (c) selective adsorption on calcium phosphate gels or w ith barium sulfate; (d) isoelectric precipitation by pH adjustment to the 10 point at which there is no net charge on a given protein; and (e) chromatography by use of adsorbents such as CM- or DEAE-cellulose or by \"Sephadex\" gel filtration. Other procedures for selectively fractionating and purifying blood proteins involve the use of amino acids such as glycine and beta alanine, water- soluble organic polymers such as glycol and polypropylene glycol, 15 and water-insoluble polyelectrolyte polymers containing basic amino groups such as the dimethylaminopropylimide group. (1) Preparation of Albumin-Containing Fraction The plasma can further be separated into a fraction containing albumin by any methods known in the art. In one specific embodiment, the albumin- 20 containing fraction is prepared by selective precipitation w ith block copolymers of ethylene oxide and polyoxypropylene polymer from the plasma (U.S. Patent No. 4,025,500). In another specific embodiment, the albumin-containing fraction is prepared by: (a) diluting the plasma in liquid form w ith a NaCI solution containing 25 disodium ethylene dinitrilo tetraacetate and an albumin stabilizer; (b) adjusting the pH of the plasma solution resulting from step (a) to about 6.2; (c) heating the plasma solution from step (b) at about 60\u00b0C for about 11/2 hours; (d) cooling the plasma solution to about 10\u00b0C; (e) precipitating impurities from the solution w ith polyethylene glycol at a concentration of about 1 8-20% w ith the albumin 30 remaining in the supernatant; (f) isoelectrically precipitating albumin from the supernatant at a pH of about 4.6; and (g) recovering the albumin-containing WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -6 9 - fraction (U.S. Patent No. 4,164,49 6). Preferably, the albumin stabilizer is sodium caprylate. In still another specific embodiment, the albumin-containing fraction is prepared by: (a) adjusting the pH of the plasma in liquid form to about 6.7; (b) 5 heating the plasma at about 60\u00b0C for about 11/2 hours; (c) adjusting the pH of the plasma to about 5.7; (d) precipitating impurities from the plasma by the addition of ethanol in an amount sufficient to give a final concentration of about 40 to 44% in the plasma along w ith cooling of the plasma to about -5\u00b0C, with the albumin remaining in the supernatant; and (e) precipitating albumin- 10 containing fraction from the supernatant at a pH of about 4.8. (U.S. Patent No. 4,222,934). A blood group substance can beremoved from the albumin-containing fraction. It can be removed for example, by treating the albumin-containing fraction w ith polyethylene glycol at pH of about 6.6 to 8.0, the effective 15 polyethylene glycol concentration in the aqueous albumin solution being about 13 to 20% (w/v), in the presence of an inorganic salt at a concentration of at most 50 g/liter measured as sodium chloride and at a temperature in the range of about 2\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, the resulting polyethylene glycol/albumin solution having a protein concentration of about 5 to 40 g/liter, thereby precipitating and removing 20 contaminant proteins containing the blood-group substance (U.S. Patent No. 4.197.238). Alternatively, the a blood group substance can be removed from the albumin-containing fraction by treating the albumin-containing fraction with polyethylene glycol at pH of about 8.0 to 9.6, the effective polyethylene glycol 25 concentration in the aqueous albumin solution being about 1 5 to 30% (w/v), in the presence of an inorganic salt at a concentration of at most 50 g/liter measured as sodium chloride and at a temperature in the range of about 2\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, the resulting polyethylene glycol/albumin solution having a protein concentration of about 5 to 40 g/liter, thereby precipitating and removing 30 contaminant proteins containing the blood-group substance (U.S. Patent No. 4.197.238). WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -7 0 - In another alternative method, the steps for removing a blood group substance from the albumin-containing fraction include treating the albumin- containing fraction w ith polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight in the range of about 2,000 to 10,000 at pH of about 6.6 to 9.6, the effective 5 polyethylene glycol concentration in the aqueous albumin solution being about 1 3 to 20% (w/v), in the presence of an inorganic salt at a concentration of at most 50 g/liter measured as sodium chloride and at a temperature in the range of about 2\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, the resulting polyethylene glycol/albumin solution having a protein concentration of about 5 to 40 g/liter, thereby precipitating and removing 10 contaminant proteins containing the blood-group substance (U.S. Patent No. 4,197,238). Polymer content and -AGP content can be reduced in the albumin- containing fractiom such as by subjecting the albumin-containing fraction to ion exchange separation using an anion exchanger, the anion exchange separation is 15 carried out at a pH ranging from about 5.1 to 5.5 (U.S. Patent No. 5,277,818). (2) Preparation of Globulin-Containing Fraction The globulin-containing fraction can be prepared according to any methods known in the art. For example, conventional methods such as Cohn alcohol fractionating process (Kistler, et al., Vox Sang , 7:4 1 4 (1962); and Cohn 20 et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 68:459-475 (1946)) and the Rivanol ammonium sulfate fractionation (Hrejsi, et al, A cta Med. Scand., 1 5 5 : 65 (1956)) can be used. Alternatively, the methods described in United States Patent Nos. 4 ,347,13 8 and 5,310,877 can be used. U.S. Patent No. 4,347,13 8 describes a method of separating serum 25 albumin and a serum -globulin from each other in a solution using a semipermeable membrane by forcing the blood serum protein m ixture solution through an ultrafiltration membrane having a cut off molecular w eight of about 100,000 and composed of an aromatic polyether sulfone, while adjusting the total protein concentration and salt concentration in the m ixture solution to not 30 more than 4 g/dl and not more than 0.6 mole/l, respectively, and also adjusting the pH of the solution to a value of from about 3.8 to about 4.7. Preferably, the pH of the blood serum protein m ixture solution is adjusted to a value of from 3.9 WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -71 - to 4.3. Also preferably, the salt contained in the blood serum protein mixture solution is sodium chloride or other physiologically acceptable salt. U.S. Patent No. 5,310,877 describes a method for the separation of gamma globulin from albumin contained in an aqueous solution of both by 5 ultrafiltration using a m icrofilter having a w ater permeability of 0.2-25 gallons per square foot per day per pound per square inch including a porous solid filter substrate one surface of which is impregnated w ith particulate solids affixed within the pores of the substrate having an average particle size of about 0 . \u00ad .5 micrometer at the feed interface, the aqueous solution being characterized in 10 that the total concentration of protein in the aqueous solution is about 0.1-2% by weight, the pH of the aqueous solution is 8-10 and the solution contains no more than about 0.01 mole per liter of inorganic electrolyte, the albumin being enriched in the retentate and the gamma globulin being enriched in the permeate. Preferably, the particulate solids being used are titanium oxide particles. Also 15 preferably, the substrate being used is sintered stainless steel. Since intravenous administration is more direct and efficient, it is sometimes desirable or necessary to administer the globulin-containing fraction intravenously. A globulin-containing fraction prepared by the conventional fractionation contains anti-complement activity, i.e., the property of fixing 20 complement non-specifically (U.S. Patent No. 4,082,73 4). This anti-com plement activity is related to the form ation of aggregates. Such globulin-containing fraction containing the anti-complement activity is not suitable for intravenous administration because the fraction can cause shock in some patients (U.S. Patent No. 4,124,57 6). Therefore, the anti-complement activity must be 25 eliminated or reduced before the globulin-containing fraction can be administered intravenously. The anti-complement activity can be eliminated or reduced according to any methods known in the art. For example, pepsin decomposition (Schultze and Schwick, HCI treatm ent et (Stephan, Z. Kiin. Chem. Kiin. Biochemie, 7:282 (1969)) can be used. In other specific WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -72 - embodiments, the processes described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,082,73 4, 4,075,193, 4 ,1 2 4 ,5 7 6 , 4 ,1 5 4 ,8 1 9 , 4,374,76 3, 4 ,4 3 6 ,7 2 4 , 4,835,257 U.S. Patent No. 4 ,0 8 2 ,7 3 4 describes a method of preparing an intravenously applicable globulin of substantially unchanged half-life but free 5 from anti-complement activity, by heating plasma or serum for about 2 to 4 hours at about 50\u00b0C to 56\u00b0C, and then fractionating, the heating having been long enough w ithin the recited parameters so that the product upon fractionation is substantially free from anti-com plement activity. Preferably, the fractionation is effected w ith alcohol or ammonium sulfate. Also preferably, the heating is 10 effected for about 2 hours at about 56\u00b0C. U.S. Patent No. 4 ,0 7 5 ,1 9 3 describes a process for producing globulin for intravenous adm inistration which comprises: 1) adsorbing plasminogen deriving from blood of a selected mammalian species on an adsorbent substrate of L- Iysine agarose; 2) washing the adsorbate to elute impurities; 3) eluting the 15 purified plasminogen the substrate; 4) converting the eluted plasminogen to plasmin; 5) incubating a m ixture of the plasmin and a quantity of homospecific immune globulin having anticomplem entary activity under conditions such that the anticomplementary activity is substantially reduced; and 6) inactivating plasmin present in the m ixture by adsorption on an inactivation adsorbent for 20 plasmin, and recovering the immune globulin. U.S. Patent No. 4 ,1 2 4 ,5 7 6 describes a process for preparing a gamma globulin substantially devoid of anticomplementary activity and suitable for intravenous adm inistration, from a material selected from the Cohn Fraction Il + Ill plasma protein paste having a protein content of about 25-30% , Cohn 25 Fraction Il paste and placental extracts containing these fractions which comprises the steps: 1) suspending the paste in w ater to form a solution of low ionic strength having a conductance of about 300 X 10 6 cm '1 ohm '1 at a pH of about 4.9 to 6.0 to produce a precipitate and a filtrate; 2) precipitating impurities from the filtrate by adding polyethylene glycol to 4% (w/v); 3) further 30 precipitating impurities by the addition of ethanol in a concentration of from 4 to 12% (w/v); and 4) precipitating the gamma globulin by adding polyethylene glycol to 10 to 12% (w/v) or by adding ethanol to 20 to 30% (v/v), preferably WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -73 - 25% (v/v) at a pH of from 7 to 8.2, preferably 8.0, the process being carried out at a temperature of about 0-6\u00b0C. U.S. Patent No. 4,1 5 4 ,8 1 9 describes a process for preparing a y-globulin solution suitable for the intravenous application by treating the solution of y- 5 globulin w ith acetimido ethyl ester hydrochloride, diketene, form im ido ethyl ester hydrochloride or propanesultone at a pH of about 9, thereafter adjusting the pH to about 7 to 7.5, and separating the solution from the solids by dialysis or fractionation followed by sterile filtration.

Methods of treatment using the resulting blood-derived compositions The compositions thus produced are suitable for treating viral 10 hemorrhagic diseases or disorders or other diseases, disorders or syndromes in which cytotoxic responses, including but are not limited to, other acute infectious diseases, sepsis, cachexia, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders, acute cardiovascular events, chronic myelogenous leukemia and transplanted bone marrow-induced graft-versus-host disease, septic shock, 15 immune complex-induced colitis, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation, autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis. Accordingly, methods for treating or preventing a viral hemorrhagic disease or disorder or other such disorders involving such cytoxic responses in a mammal are provided. These methods include the steps of administering to the mammal an effective amount of the immune 20 composition(s) produced according to the above processes. Furthermore, such compositions can be used alone or in combination w ith a tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound(s) and/or other anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent(s), such as IL-1 inhibitors and TNF inhibitors. Any of the above noted disorders and disorders involving an acute inflamm atory response can be treated 25 by the compositions. Viral hemorrhagic diseases can be treated by administration of tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound(s), The effectiveness of administration of a tetracycline compound or tetracycline-like compound(s) for treatm ent is optimal shortly after infection. Such treatm ent is preferably 30 combined w ith administration of the compositions provided herein and/or other treatm ents for viral hemorrhagic disorders. WO 00/64479PCT/USOO/11700 -8 5 - Methods for treating disorders involving acute inflam m atory responses characterized by elevated and debilitating levels of cytokines are provided. These disorders include those enumerated herein and any others in which acute inflammatory responses, as assessed by elevated levels of TNF and/or IL-1, 5 occur. Several methods are provided. In one method a mammal determined to have an acute inflamm atory response or a disease or condition characterized by such response is treated w ith a blood-derived composition provided herein. The mammal may also be treated w ith a tetracycline or tetracycline-like compound or plurality thereof 10 and/or w ith a treatm ent known to have some effect on the symptoms of or on disorder. AU treatm ents may be administered simultaneously, successively or interm ittently and, as necessary, repeatedly and for a time sufficient to observe an amelioration or treatm ent of the symptoms of the disease, condition or disorder. 15 Hence, including among the methods provided herein, are methods in which such mammals are treated w ith blood or fraction thereof that has been contacted w ith a tetracycline or tetracycline-like compounds either in vitro or in vivo. Where the blood is treated in vivo, it is obtained from a donor who has been administered a tetracycline and tetracycline-like compounds prior to 20 providing blood. Where the blood or a fraction thereof, particularly w hite blood cell-containing fraction, such as buffy coats, has been treated in vitro w ith a tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compound(s), it is obtained from an untreated donor and then either fractionated prior to contacting or subsequent to contacting. In one embodiment, the blood is treated to obtain the buffy coat, 25 which contains the w hite blood cells. The buffy coat fraction is contacted in vitro w ith a tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compound(s). The medium from the treated cells is administered. It can be further fractionated or concentrated prior to administration. In all instances, the levels of the TNF and IL-1 receptors are monitored prior to contacting w ith the tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like 30 compound(s), during and after contacting for at least a three-fold increase in the level of such receptors compared to the baseline, prior to contacting w ith the tetracycline and/or tetracycline-like compound(s). Such measure serves as WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/1I700 -8 6 - indicator that the factors, which include sTNF receptors and/or IL-1 receptors, particularly IL-1 RA. These receptors serve as the marker for a sufficient level of induction of the palliative factors; they are not necessarily the only factors responsible for the observed effects. 5 These methods may also be combined w ith other methods for treating such disorders, such as other anti-lL-1 antibodies, anti-IL-1 receptor antibodies, IL-1 receptor antagonists, IL-1 production inhibitors, IL-1 receptor production inhibitors, and IL-1 releasing inhibitors. Administration is effected by any suitable route, including systemic, local 10 and topical administration, such intramuscularly, intravenously, parenterally and orally. Typically, administration of a blood product will be via IV route. Administration of a tetracycline compound will be orally. Am ounts of tetracycline is about 100-500 mg tw ice per day for one or more days, typically at least three and up to about ten days. These amounts are also the amounts 15 for administration human donors to induce factors for preparation of the blood- derived compositions. The disorders include hemorrhagic diseases and disorders, wasting diseases, sepsis, autoimmune disorders, particularly acute episodes associated w ith autoimmune disorders, acute episodes associated w ith multiple sclerosis, 20 acute allergic reactions and other inflammatory diseases. The methods herein are particularly useful for treating hemorrhagic diseases or disorders, for which there have heretofore been few , if any, effective treatm ents. In one method, a mammal suffering from such disorder is treated w ith by an amount of a tetracycline and tetracycline-like compounds effective to 25 ameliorate a symptom of the disorder, particularly, a disorder associated with elevated levels of cytokines associated w ith an acute inflamm atory disorder. This method is intended for treatm ent of viral hemorrhagic fevers, and also bacterial infections, such as E. coli infections. In another embodiment, the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent is a tumor 30 necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, including an anti-TNF antibody, an anti-TNF receptor antibody, TNF receptor antagonist, a TNF production inhibitor, a TNF receptor production inhibitor a TNF releasing inhibitor. In another WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -87 - exemplary embodiment, the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent is an anti-viral vaccine, an anti-viral antibody, a viral-activated immune cell or a viral-activated immune serum. Any specific examples of the IL-1 inhibitor, the TNF inhibitor, the anti\u00ad viral vaccines, the anti-viral antibodies, the viral-activated immune cells or the 5 viral-activated serum can be used in the combinational therapy. The tetracycline compound(s) and/or the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent(s) can be used alone or in combination w ith other known therapeutic agents or techniques (including chemotherapeutics, radioprotectants and radiotherapeutics) to either improve the quality of life of the patient, or to treat the disease, such as 10 viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders. For example, the tetracycline compound(s) and/or the anti-viral-hemorrhagic agent(s) can be used before, during or after radiation treatm ent. F. VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC DISEASES OR DISORDERS AND DIAGNOSIS THEREOF 15 The methods and compositions provided herein are particularly suited for treatm ent of viral hemorrhagic diseases. To effectively employ such methods, proper diagnosis is recommended. Hence follow ing is a list of exemplary hemorrhagic diseases, the causative agents and methods of diagnosis. Examples of the viral hemorrhagic diseases or disorders that can be 20 treated by the present methods include, but are not limited to, viral hemorrhagic disease caused by infection w ith Bunyaviridaea, a Filoviridae, a Flaviviridae, or an Arenaviridae virus. 1. Bunyaviridaea Virus Infection Examples of Bunyaviridaea and tete viruses), sandfly fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus of sheep and ruminants, Nairovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Uukuvirus, Uukuniemi virus, Hantaan virus and Korean hemorrhagic fever virus (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,786,342). Of particular interest is treatm ent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic 30 fever virus, Hantaan virus and Korean hemorrhagic fever virus infections, particularly, Hantaan virus. Specific strains of Hantaan virus include 76-118 strain (Avsic-Zupanc, et al., Am . J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 51 (4):393-400 (1994); Gu, WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -8 8 - et al., Chin. Med. J. (Engl)., I 0 3 (6 ):455-9 (1990); Miyamoto, Zasshi., 61 (6):639-44 (1987 al., Microbiol. Immunol., 37(7):557-62 (1993); and Yoshimatsu, et al., J. Gen. 5 Virol.. 7 7(4):695-704 (1996 Apr)). Bunyaviridaea virus infection, and particularly Hantaan virus infection, can be diagnosed by any methods known in the art according to clinical, immunological or molecular criteria. Any known immunological methods can be used in the diagnosis of Bunyaviridaea or Hantaan virus infection (see e.g., 10' Current Protocols in Immunology (Ed. Coligan et al.) John W iley & Sons, Inc., 1997); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory M anual (2nd Ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989)). Such methods are known (see, e.g., Burkhardt, et al., Fortschr. Med., 111 (33):528-9 (1993) and van Ypersele de Strihou, al., Lancet, 5-6 6):1493 or antigen- 15 based immunological methods include immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, dot blotting and in situ immuno-detection methods such as immunofluorescence can be used. In a specific embodiment, anti-Bunyaviridaea virus or anti-Hantaan virus antibodies described herein can be used in the immunodiagnosis. Nucleotide-sequence based molecular methods include nucleotide 20 sequencing, nucleotide hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), especially reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used. Hantaan virus nucleotide fragments w ith all or portions of the following Genbank Accession Nos. can be used in the nucleotide-sequence based molecular diagnosing methods: L08753. 2. Filoviridae Virus Filoviruses are classified in the order Mononegavirales (Pringle C.R., Arch. 30 Virol., 11 7 :1 37-140 (1991)), which also contains the nonsegmented negative- strand RNA virus families Paramyxoviradae, Rhabdoviridae, of the fam ily Filoviridae virus, a unique agent w ithout WO 00/64479 PCT/USOO/117O0 -8 9 - known subtypes, and Ebola virus, which has four subtypes (Zaire, Sudan, Reston, and Ivory Coast) (Feldmann and Slenczka Klenk, Arch. Virol. 11 (Suppl):77-100 (1996) ; LeGuenno B., al., Lancet, 3 45 :12 71-127 (1995); Pringle C.R., Arch. Virol., 1 1 7 :1 37-140 (1991)). Specific strains of ebola virus 5 include Zaire strain (Jaax, et al., Lancet, 346(8991 -8 9 9 2 ):1 669-71 (1995), Andromeda strain (Johnson, Ann. Intern. Med., 91(1):1 17-9 (1979), Gabon 94 strain (Prehaud, et al., J. Gen. Virol., 79(11 ):2565-72 (1998) and Sudan, Reston, and Ivory (Feldmann and Slenczka Klenk, Arch. Virol. 11 (Suppl):77-100 (1996) ; LeGuenno B., al., Lancet, 345 :12 71-127 (1995); 10 Pringle C.R are enveloped, nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses. The tw o species, Marburg and Ebola virus, are serologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct. Classification, virion morphology and structure, genomic organization and diagnosis are described in detail in Beer et al., 15 Naturwissenschaften, 86:8-17 (1999), Springer-Verlag 1999. Marburg and Ebola viruses are pleomorphic particles that vary greatly in length, but the unit length associated w ith peak in fectivity is 790 nm for Marburg virus and 970 nm Ebola virus (Regnery et al., J. Virol., 36:465 -4 69 (1980)). The virions appear as either long filamentous (and sometimes branched) forms or in shorter LI- 20 shaped, 6-shaped (mace-shaped), or circular (ring) configurations (Murphy et al., Paltyn S.R. (ed) Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever, Elsevier/North-Holland, Amsterdam, pp. 61-82 (1978); Peters et al., Martini and Siegert (eds) Marburg virus disease, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg, New York, pp. 68-83 (1971)). Virions have a uniform diameter of 80 nm and a density of 1.14 g/ml. They are 25 composed of a helical nucleocapsid, a closely apposed envelope derived from the host cell plasma membrane, and a surface projection layer composed of trimers of viral glycoportein (GP) (Feldmann et al., Virology, 1 8 2 :353-356 (1991)). All filoviruses contain one molecule of noninfectious, linear, negative-sense, single\u00ad stranded RNA w ith a M r of 4.2 x 106, constituting 1.1 % of the virion mass [Kiley 30 M.P., et al., J. Gen. Virol., 6 9 :1 9 5 7 -1 5 6 7 (1988); Regnery et al., J. Virol., (1980)). - The nonsegmented RNA genomes of filoviruses show the gene arrangement 3'-NP-VP35-VP40-GP-VP30-VP24-L-5' w ith a total molecular length of approximately 19 kb (Table 2). Table 2.

Filoviridae virus infection, and particularly ebola and Marburg virus infection, can be diagnosed by any methods known in the art according to 20 clinical, immunological or molecular criteria (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory M anual (2nd Ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Antibody-based or antigen-based immunological methods include immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, dot blotting and in situ immuno-detection methods such as immunofluorescence can be used. In a specific embodiment, 25 anti-Filoviridae virus or anti-ebola and anti-Marburg virus antibodies, such as those described herein, can be used in the diagnosis of Bunyaviridaea or Hantaan virus infection (see, e.g., Current Protocols in Immunology (Ed. Coligan et al.) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997). WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -9 1 Nucleotide-sequence based molecular nucleotide hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), especially reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used. In a specific embodiment, the ebola virus nucleotide sequences w ith the following 5 Genbank Accession Nos. can be used in the nucleotide-sequence based molecular diagnosing methods: AF086833, U 77384-U 77385, U 8 1 1 6-U2341 23187, U 23152, U 23069, A F 034645, AF054908, X 7 embodiment, the Marburg virus nucleotide sequences w ith 10 the following Genbank Accession Nos. can be used in the nucleotide-sequence based molecular diagnosing methods: A F 92834 and M 36065. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is one of the most powerful tools of diagnosis of filovirus infection (Volchkov V., et al., Virology, 15 2 3 2 :1 39-144 (1997)). Antibodies to filovirus can be detected by using acetone-fixed virus-infected cells inactivated by /1-radiation al., Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg., 76:307 -3 10 (1982); Johnson et al., Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg., 77:731-733 (1983)), which should not be used under field conditions. An enzyme-linked 20 immunosorbent assay using a mild detergent extract of infected Vero cells adsorbed to plastic plates has been shown to be more reliable (Ksiazek, Lab. Anim ., 20:34-46 (1991)) under such conditions. Vero cells are readily used for the isolation and propagation of fresh and laboratory passaged strains of the viruses. M A-104 cells and SW 13 cells have 25 also been successful in primary filovirus isolation (McCormick et al., J. infect. Dis., 147:264-267 (1983)). In some circumstances primary isolation in guinea pigs (for Marburg virus) or suckling mice (for Ebola virus) may be required. A western blot method has been standardized for the diagnosis of filovirus infections [Elliott et al., J. Virol. Methods, 43:85-89 (1993)). Solid- 30 phase indirect enzyme-immunoassay (SPEIA) has been used to detect Lassa and Ebola virus antigens and antibodies using horseradish testing of form alin-fixed postmortem skin specimens can also be performed (see, e.g., Zaki, et al., J. Infect. Dis., 1 7 9 (S u p p I1 ):S 3 6 -4 7 (1 9 9 9 )). 3. Flaviviridae Virus Infection 5 AU members of the Flaviviridae fam ily share common morphologic characteristics, genome structure, and replication and translation strategies (see, e.g., Kautner, et al., J. Pediatr., 13 1 :51 6-524 (1997)). Examples of Flaviviridae viruses flavivirus, Brazilian encephalitis virus, Bussuquara virus, dengue virus, iiheus virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus, Japanese B 10 encephalitis virus, kunjin virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Iangat virus, Iouping ill virus, modoc virus, Murray valley encephalitis virus, ntaya virus, omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, Louis encephalitis virus, spondwnei virus, tick-borne encephalitis, Uganda S virus, US bat salivary gland virus, wesselsbron virus, west nile fever virus, yellow fever virus, zika virus, European 15 tick-borne encephalitis. Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis virus and Russian tick- borne encephalitis (U.S. Patent No. 5,786,342). Preferably, the dengue virus to be treated is a dengue type 1, dengue type 2, dengue type 3 or dengue type 4 virus. Specific dengue type 1 virus strains include Singapore strain S275/90 (Fu, et al., Virology, 188(2):953-8 (1992)), W estern Pacific strain (Puri, et al., 20 Virus Genes, 17(1 ):85-8 (1998)) and Mochizuki strain (Zulkarnain, et al., MicobioL Immunol., 38(7):581-5 (1994)). Specific dengue type 2 virus strains include Brazilian strain (Barth, et al., Mem. Inst. Oswa/do. Cruz., 86(1 ):1 23-4 (1991)), New Guinea C strain (Biedrzycka, et al., J. Gen. Virol., 6 8(5):1 317-26 Kapoor, et al., Gene, 25 162(2):175-80 (1995); Price, et al., Am . J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 22(1):92-9 (1973)), strain 16681 (Kinney, et al., Virology, 230 (2 ):300-8 (1997)), strain PR- 159 (Leblois, et al., Nucleic A cids Res., 21 (7):1 668 (1993)), Cuban A l 5 strain (Pupo-Antunez, et al., Hybridoma., 1 6(4):347-53 (1997)) and Mexican strain (Sanchez, et al., J. Gen. Virol., 77(10 ):2541 -5 (1996)). Hence, the family 3 - Flaviviridae includes human pathogens, Dengue viruses, the Japanese encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus. Four dengue virus serotypes and various \"biotypes\" can be differentiated. Mature dengue virus particles have a single-stranded ribonucleic acid genome 5 surrounded by an approximately icosahedral nucleocapsid w ith a diameter of 30 nm. The nucleocapsid is covered by a lipid envelope of 10 nm thickness derived from host cell membranes and contains the envelope and membrane proteins (W estaway et al., Flaviridiac. Intervirology, 24:183-92 (1985)). The viral genome of approximately 11 kb is infectious, has a messenger- 10 like positive polarity, and can be translated in vitro. The 5' end of the RNA has a type I cap structure but lacks a poly A tail at the 3' end (Rice et al., Science, 2 2 9 :726-33 (1985); Hahnet al., Virology, 1 6 2 :1 67-80 (1988); Irie et al., Gene, 74:197-211 (1989)). It contains a single open reading frame of about 10,000 nucleotides encoding three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. The 15 gene order is 5'-C-prM(M)-E-NSI-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5. The proteins are synthesized as a polyprotein of about 3000 aminoacids that is processed cotranslationally and posttranslationally by viral and host proteases (Biedrzycka et al., J. Gen. Virol., 1987, 68:1317-26; Mackow et al., J. Gen. Virol., 1987, 69:23-4; Speight et al., J. Gen. Virol., 1988, 69:23-34; Chambers 20 et al., Virology, 1989, 1 6 9 :100-9; Markoll et al., J. Virol., 1989, 63:334 5-52; Preugschar J. Virol., 1 6 4-74; Falgout et al., J. Virol., al., J. Virol., 1991, 65:4749-58; Preugschat F., et al., Virology, 1 9 9 1 , 1 8 5 :689-97; Cahour et al., J. Virol., 1 992, 66:1 535-42). The structural proteins include a capsid protein rich in arginine and lysine 25 residues and a nonglycosylated prM protein produced from a glycosylated precursor in a late step of virus m aturation (Rice et al., Science, 1985, 2 2 9 :726- 33; Hahn et al., Virology 1988, 1 6 2 :1 67-80; Deubel et al., J. Virol. Methods, 1990, 30:41-54; Randolph et al., Virology 1990, 174:450-8). The major structural envelope protein is involved in the main biologic functions of the virus 30 particle such as cell tropism, acid-catalyzed membrane fusion, and the induction of hemagglutination-inhibiting, neutralizing, and protective antibodies (Depros et al., Virology, 1 993. 1 9 6 :209-1 9). WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -9 4 - The first nonstructural protein is NSI, a glycoprotein w ith a function in the virus life cycle that is unknown (Schlesinger et al., J. Immunol., 1985, 1 3 5 :2805-9). NS1 proteins are detected in high titers in patients w ith secondary dengue infections, but are rarely found in primary infections (Kuno et 5 al., J. Med. Viro/., 1990, 32:102-8). The NS2 region codes for tw o proteins (NS2A and NS2B) that are thought to be implicated in polyprotein processing, whereas NS3 is probably the viral proteinase that functions in the cytosol (Preugschat et al., Virology, 1991, 1 8 5 :689-97: Cahour et al., J. Virol., 1992, 66:1535-42; Falgout et al., J. Virol., 1989, 63:1852-60). The NS4 region 10 codes for tw o small hydrophobic proteins that seem to be involved in the establishment of the membrane bound RNA replication complex. The protein encoded by the NS5 gene has a molecular weight of 105,000, is the most conserved flavivirus protein and is the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. 15 Flaviviridae virus infection, and particularly dengue virus infection, can be diagnosed by any methods known in the art according to clinical, immunological or molecular criteria. Any known immunological methods can be used in the diagnosis of Flaviviridae or dengue virus infection (see Current Protocols in Immunology (Ed. Coligan et al.) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997). Antibody- 20 based or antigen-based immunological methods include immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, dot blotting and in situ immuno-detection methods such as immunofluorescence can be used. Antibodies described herein can be used in the immunodiagnosis. Any known molecular methods can be used in the diagnosis of 25 Flaviviridae or dengue infection (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory M anual (2nd Ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Nucleotide-sequence based molecular methods include nucleotide sequencing, nucleotide hybridization, polymerase reaction (PCR), especially polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used. Dengue virus 30 nucleotide fragm ents containing all or portions of sequences w ith the following Genbank Accession Nos. can be used in the nucleotide-sequence based molecular diagnosing methods: E06832, 70952. -9 5 - The diagnosis of dengue relies in most case on clinical judgm ent because only a few major centers have the facilities and means to perform and verify the clinical impression. Diagnostic criteria for DHS based on clinical observations have been proposed by the World Health Organization and should be used to 5 avoid over-diagnosis (World Health Organization. Dengue hemorrhagic fever: diagnosis, treatm ent and control, Geneva, WHO, 1986). Clinical criteria for diagnosis are as follows: (1) fever; (2) hemorrhagic m anifestations, including at least a positive tourniquet test result and a major or minor bleeding phenomenon; (3) hepatic enlargement; (4) shock (high pulse rate and narrowing of the pulse 10 pressure to 20 mm Hg or less, or hypotension). The laboratory criteria include (5) thrombocytopenia ( < 10 0,000 /m m 3), and (6) hemoconcentration (hematocrit increase > 2 0 % ). Thrombocytopenia w ith concurrent high hem atocrit levels differentiates DHF from classic DF. A secondary dengue infection is characterized by the rapid appearance of 15 broadly cross-reactive antibodies. Hemagglutination inhibition titers of 1:20 in the acute-phase sample rise to > 1:2560 in the convalescent phase sample. An antibody titer of > 1:1 280 in the acute-phase sample w ithout a fourfold or greater increase in the second sample also is considered presumptive of recent infection. A less time-consuming method is a capture enzyme-linked 20 immunosorbent assay that can detect specific anti-dengue IgM in a single acute- phase sample (Lam et al., Southeast Asian, J. Trop. Med. Public Health, 1987, 18:532-8). Commercial kits for the detection of specific IgG as well as IgM antibodies have become available. They are based on a dot enzyme assay or a 25 nitrocellulose membrane-based capture form at, respectively, and should be suitable for field research (Cardosa et al., J. Virol. M ethods, 1988, 22:81-8; Cardosa et al., Southeast Asian, J. Trop. Med. Public Health, 1988, I 9:591-4; Cardosa et al., d in . Diagn. Virol., 1995, 3:343-50). An alternative to virus isolation is the detection of viral RNA by reverse 30 transcription polymerase chain reaction. There are various protocols available using different primers and tem plate isolation (Deubel et al., J. Virol. Methods, 1990, 30:41-54; Henchal et al., Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 1 9 9 1 , 45:418-28; WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -9 6 J. Clin. Microbiol., 1991, 29:210 7-10; Morita et al., J. Med. 1994, 44:54-8; al., J. Clin. M icrobiol., 1992, 30:545 -5 1; Chan et al., Southeast Asian, J. Trop. Med. Public Health, 1994, 25^:258-61; Seah et al., J. Virol. Methods, 1 995, J5 1 _ :1 93-200). Reversetranscription polymerase chain 5 reaction coupled w ith hybridization w ith labeled serotype-specific probes can detect as fe w as 4 plaque-forming units per 100/vl serum and gives the best results early in the acute phase of the disease when dengue antibodies are still low (Chan et al., Southeast Asian, J. Trop. Med. Public Health, 1994, 25:258- 61). Less than 1 p\\ of serum can be sufficient for the detection of viral RNA 10 (Chan et al., J. Virol. Methods, 1 994, 49:31 5-22). 4. Arenaviridae Virus Infection Examples of Arenaviridae viruses fever virus and arenavirus (U.S. Patent No. 5,786,34 2). Preferably, the Arenaviridae 15 viruses to be treated are Junin virus, Iassa virus, machupo virus. Specific strains of Iassa virus include Josiah strain (Auperin, et al., Virology, 1 68(2):421-5 (1989); and Fidarov, et al., Vopr Virusol., 3 5 (4 ):326-9 (1990) and Nigerian strain (Clegg, et al., VirusRes., 18(2-3):151-64 (1991)). Arenaviridae virus infection, and particularly Iassa virus, machupo virus, 20 or pichinde virus infection, can be diagnosed by any methods known in the art according to clinical, immunological or molecular criteria. Any known immunological methods can be used in the diagnosis of Arenaviridae virus infection, and particularly Iassa virus, machupo virus, or pichinde virus infection (see Current Protocols in Immunology (Ed. Coligan et al.) John W iley & Sons, 25 Inc., 1997). Antibody-based or antigen-based immunological methods include im m uniprecipitation, Western blotting, dot blotting and in situ immuno-detection methods such as immunofluorescence can be used. In a specific embodiment, anti-Arenaviridae virus or anti-lassa virus, anti-machupo virus and anti-pichinde virus antibodies known to those of skill in the or described herein can be used in 30 the immunodiagnosis. Any known molecular methods can be used in the diagnosis of Arenaviridae virus infection, and particularly Iassa virus, machupo virus, or WO 00/64479 PCT/USOO/117O0 -9 7 - pichinde virus infection (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2nd Ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989); see also, Sarrat, et al., Bull Soc Pathol Exot Filiales., 65(5):642-50 (1 972) (Histopathological diagnosis of hepatitis due to Lassa virus); and Trappier, et al., Am. J. Trop. Med. 5 Hyg., 4 9(2):214-21 (1993) (Evaluation of the polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of Lassa virus infection)). Nucleotide-sequence based molecular methods include nucleotide sequencing, nucleotide hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), especially reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used. 10 Lassa virus nucleic acid fragments containing sequences from the following Genbank Accession Nos. can be used in the nucleotide-sequence based molecular diagnosing methods: acid fragments containing sequences from the follow ing Genbank Accession Nos. can be used 15 in the nucleotide-sequence based molecular diagnosing methods: X 62616. G. EXAMPLES The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to lim it the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 20 TREATMENT OF MARBURG AND LASSA VIRUS INFECTION a. EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS (I) Virus Marburg virus strain Popp used in the following experiments was received from the Belarussian Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology 25 (Minsk, Belarussia). AU work w ith infectious virus was performed in the maximum-containment biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) facility of the State Scientific Center of Virology and Biotechnology (\"V ector\") (Koltsavo, Russia).

Animals of the fifth group (T) sever as the Tetracycline controls, i.e., were given Tetracycline-Hcl solution (58 mg/kg) intramuscularly during the 17 day period w ithout virus injection. 5d. Animals of the fifth group (d) sever as the Doxycycline controls, i.e., were given Doxycycline solution (58 mg/kg) intramuscularly during the 17 day 15 period w ithout virus injection. Animals of the above groups were parenterally infected w ith Marburg virus at a dose of 5LD5 0 on day \"0 \". The virus was detected by RT-PCR on the third day after infection. As seen in Table 3, tetracycline and doxycycline are not toxic to control 20 groups (5T, 5D). Using tetracycline and doxycycline prophylactically does not improve survival rate of the animals (2T, 2D, 3T and 3D). In fact, the mean time to death (m.t.d.) of these groups is shorter than that of the virus control group (1). In contrast, using tetracycline and doxycycline therapeutically increases survival rate of the animals because 2 animals from the group 4T and 4T, 25 respectively, survived the otherwise lethal infection. In addition, the m .t.d. of groups 4T and 4D is slightly longer than that of the virus control group (1).

Treatment of Lassa virus infection Animals were divided into the follow ing groups, each containing 20 mice: 1. Animals of the first group were infected w ith Lassa virus w ithout any tetracycline or doxycycline treatm ent. 15 2. Animals of the second group were given 0.2 ml of TetracycIine-HCI solution (58 mg/kg) from the third day until 7th day after virus injection (every day). 3. Animals of the third group were given 0.2 ml of DoxycycIine-HCI solution (58 mg/kg) form the third day until 7th day after virus injection (every day). 20 4. Animals of the fourth group were given TetracycIine-HCI solution during a 7 day period w ithout viral infection. 5. Animals of the fifth group were given Doxycyciine-HCI solution during a 7 day period w ithout viral infection. Animals of all the above groups were infected intracerebrally w ith Lassa 25 virus at a dose of 10 PFU/0.03 ml on day \"0 \". The virus was detected by RT- PCR on the third day after infection. As seen in Table 4, tetracycline and doxycycline are not toxic to control groups (1). Using tetracycline and doxycycline therapeutically increases survival rate of the animals because Group 2 and 3 have higher survival rates than Group WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -1 0 1 - 1 (P< 0 .0 1 ). In addition, the m .t.d. of groups 2-3 is slightly longer than that of Group 1. Levels of IL-1, IL-IRa, TNF and soluble TNF receptor (STNFR) were monitored in the Lassa virus control animals (Table 5) and tetracycline or 5 doxycycline treated animals (Table 6) by ELISA using the ELISA kits or antibodies from R&D Systems, Inc. (U.S.A.). The ratio of IL -I/IL-1 Ra in virus control animals (Table 5) increased dramatically to about 20 fold of the base level (Day 9) as the infection progresses and then returned to the base level (Day 21). In contrast, the ratio of IL-I /IL-I Ra in tetracycline or doxycycline treated 10 animals (Table 6) increased to only about 5 fold of the base level (Day 3) and then returned to the base level (Day 21).

EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS (1) Virus 25 Dengue virus, type 2 was used in the follow ing experiments. AU work w ith infectious virus was performed in the m axim um -containm ent biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) facility of the \"V ector\". This virus was amplified in the brain of succlik mice (inbred BALB Ic mice from Vector) and was collected to produce WO 00/64479 PCT/USOO/117O0 -103 - stocks. This stock virus suspension was stored at -40\u00b0C , containing 6.8 Ig LD5 0 /ml (in mice BALB/ c by intraperitoneal challenge). (2) Animals 4-week old BALB/c mice (haplotype H-2k) were used in the experiments 5 w ith Dengue virus infection. Mice weigh 12-14 grams. The animals were received from SRC VB \"Vector\" and kept at a standard ration. (3) RT-PCR procedure The virus detection was provided by PCR-method. Primers for Dengue virus type 2 detection are upper 5' AATATGCTGAAACGCGAGAGAAACCG 10 (position 136-161 of the dengue virus RNA SEQ ID No. 23 and lower 5' AAGGAACGCCACCAAGGCCATG (position 237-258) SEQ ID NO. 24. RNA was extracted from serums of infected animals (mice) using the RNeasy Kit (Quigen, Germany). For RT-PCR, Titan kits (Behringer, Germany) 15 was used. Reverse transcription was conducted at 4 2 \u00b0C for 6 0 ' followed by 40 amplification cycles at 94\u00b0C for 3 0 \", 5 5 0C for 1', and 68\u00b0C for 2' w ith a final extension at 6 8 0C for 7 mins. Am plification was conducted in 0.2 ml tubes w ith a model BIS-105M thermocycler (Russia). b. Treatment of dengue virus infection 20 Group 1 The animals of this group (60 animals) were given Doxycycline solution (58 mg/kg) intramuscularly every day for 4 days. From the first day, sera were taken from mice daily to detect concentration of IL-1, TNF, IL-1 RA and sTNFr (Table 7). 25 Group 2 Animals of the second group are virus controls, i.e., were infected w ith the dengue virus w ithout doxycycline treatm ent. The virus detection was provided by PCR-method on the second day after infection. From the first day after infection, sera were taken from mice daily to detect concentration of IL-1, 30 TNF, IL-1 RA and sTNFr (Table 8). WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -104 - Group 3 The animals from this group were given 0.2 ml of Doxycycline solution (58 mg/kg) intramuscularly from the second day after virus injection till the fifth day daily. The virus detection was provided by PCR-method on the second day 5 after infection. From the first day after infection, sera were taken from mice daily to detect concentrations of IL-1, TNF, IL-1 RA and sTNFr (Table 9). Group 4 The animals from this group were given 0.2 ml of doxycycline solution (58 mg/kg) intramuscularly form the third day after virus injection till the fifth 10 day daily. The virus detection was provided by PCR-method on the second day after the infection. From the first day after infection, sera were taken from mice daily to detect concentration of IL-1, TNF, IL-1 RA and sTNFr (Table 10). Group 5 The animals from this group were given, intravenously daily from the 15 second day after infection till the sixth day, 0.3 ml of the serum collected from the animals of the group 1 on the first day after those animals were treated with doxycycline. In this volume, the Serum collected from the animals of group 1 contain 6.6 pg IL-1, 60 pg IL-1 ra, 1.5 pg TNF and 25 pg. The virus detection was provided by PCR-method on the second day after infection. From the first 20 day after infection, the sera were taken from the mice of group 5 to detect concentration of IL-1, TNF, IL-1 RA and sTNFr (Table 11). Group 6 The animals from this group were given, intravenously daily from the second day after infection till the sixth day, 0.3 ml of the serum collected from 25 the animals of the group 1 on the second day after those animals were treated w ith doxycycline. In this volume, the Serum collected from the animals of group 1 contain 6 pg IL-1, 20 pg IL-I ra, 5.5 pg TNF and 1 2 pg sTNFr. The virus detection was provided by PCR method on the second day after animals infection. From the first day after infection, sera were taken from the mice of 30 Group 6 daily to detect concentration of IL-1, TNF, IL-1 RA and sTNFr (Table 12). WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -105 - c. Results and Discussion As seen in Table 6, injection of doxycycline to the uninfected mice increases production of the cytokines and their soluble receptors. It is noteworthy that this response, i.e., increased production of cytokines and their 5 soluble receptors, to the first doxycycline injection was higher than to the second and the third doxycycline injection. This difference signifies development of the refractory period in mice on the second and the third day after the injection of doxycycline. Therefore, multiple injections of doxycycline to the uninfected mice does not keep high concentrations of the soluble cytokine 10 receptors in their sera. The experiments using BALB/c (haplotype H-2d) and C57BI/6 (H-2b) mice show that the dosage of Dengue virus of 10 - 10,000 LD5 0 is absolutely lethal (100%) after intraperitoneal challenge to these mice weighing 12-14 grams. 15 In the experiments described below, BALB/c mice weighing 12-14 grams were used. These mice died tow ard the end of the fifth day after the infection w ith the dose of Dengue virus 100 LD50. In the sera of animals from Group 2 (virus control group), the concentration of IL-1 increases during the development of the infection more significantly than the concentration of IL-1 RA (Table 8). 20 The large excess of IL-1 over IL-1 RA manifests in the ratio of IL-1/IL-1 RA. These experiments show the importance of detecting the ratio IL-1/IL-1 RA in prognosis of the development of the disease caused by the Dengue virus infection. The change in the ratio of TNF to sTNFr during the course of Dengue virus infection is analogous to that of the ratio of IL-1 to IL-1 RA. Overall, the 25 concentration of these tw o cytokines increases more significantly than that of their respective receptors during the course of the infection. The concentration of TNF increased 500 times on the day of death but the concentration of sTNFr only increased 4 times. In addition, the ratio of TNF/sTNFr, rather than the TNF concentration itself, is more significant for the resolution of Dengue virus 30 infection. Similarly, the increased ratio of IL-1/IL-1 RA means rapid resolution of Dengue (type 2) virus infection.

Expression of soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-IRa) in E. coli The coding region of the IL-IRa (residues 3-152, numbering according to Eisenberg et al. (1 990) Nature 343 :34 1-346; see, also Arend e t al. (1990) J i 20 Clin. Invest. 85:1 694-1797 and Hannum et al. (1 990) Nature 3 4 3 :336-340) as amplified from U937 cDNA by PCR w ith the introduction of an additional glycine residue, a BamHI restriction site at the 5' end and an EcoRI site at 25 26). Using these primers, the mature recombinant IL-IRa protein has the N- terminal sequence GSGRK, which is different from that of the native IL-IRa WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -110 - protein, which is RPSGRK. The PCR product was introduced into the fusion protein expression vector pGEX-2T [Pharmacia; see, also Smith e t al. (1988) Gene 67:21-40) and transform ed into the E. coli strain N M 554 (well known, see, e.g., Raleigh et al. (1 988) Nucl. Acids Res. 1 6:1 563-1 575; and commercially 5 available from, for example, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The expressed fusion protein glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IL-IRa is cleaved w ith thrombin to obtain an authentic recombinant IL-IRa protein. b. Monitoring production of TNF, soluble TNF receptor (sTNF R), IL-1, IL-IRa in the follow ing disease models 10 There are disease models for monitoring disease progression and the efficacy of various treatm ent protocols. Exemplary models are as follows. (1) Schwarzmann reaction (endotoxic shock) Endotoxic shock is accompanied by an increased IFN, TNF and IL-1 production, which simulates bacterial infection. BALB/c mice model are used in 15 this study. (2) Ectomelia (mousepox) BALB/c mice model are used in this study. Development of this lethal disease is accompanied by the increased TNF, IL-1 and IFN production. Ectomelia virus gains entry through minute abrasions of the skin where it 20 multiplies to produce a primary lesion. While this lesion is developing, a series of invasive steps produce a secondary viremia that seeds the skin and other organs w ith virus. A rash appears about 3 days after the primary lesion occurs. (3) Experimental Lassa fever. CBA/calac mice, which are highly sensitive to Lassa virus infection, are 25 used in this study. Infection w ith the Lassa virus in the CBA/calac mice is accompanied by inflamm ation characterized histologically by cerebral edema, functional activity of kupffer cells, and necrosis of individual hepatocytes. Marked cytokine production also accompanies the disease development. WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -111 (4) Experimental HFRS fever (Hantaan virus). C57B1/6 mice, which are highly sensitive to Hantaan virus infection, are used in this study. Development of this lethal disease is accompanied by the increased TNF and IL-1 production. 5 (5) Experimental Dengue fever BALB/c mice are used in this study. The mice are infected w ith denver fever virus. Development of this lethal disease is accompanied w ith by increased TNF, IL-1 and IFN production. The data on dynamics of TNF, IL-1, sTNF and IL-Ira production and also 10 dynamics of viremia are collected. These data allow the interrelationships between these cytokines, soluble receptors and the disease course to be determined. The scheme of administration of the soluble IL-Ira and anti-TNF and anti-lL-1 drugs, which are likely to provide the healing of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) in the above models, are based on the results thus 15 obtained.

In group B2, w hich was treated w ith tetracycline therapy, 40% of the animals survived (the m .t.d. of 5.84 is not statistically different from group A2). The concentration of IL-1 increased 10- fold by day 5 of the disease, the concentration of TNF increased 2-fold. The 25 level of the cytokines in the serum of the animals of this group was statistically lower than in the control A2 group. In group C2, which was treated vibromycine, 20% of the animals survived, m .t.d. was 6.7 statistically higher WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -115 - than in the control A2 group. The concentration of IL-1 increased 12-fold by day 6 of the infection, and the concentration of TNF increased 3-fold. The level of cytokines in the serum of the animals of this group was statistically lower than in the control A2 group. In group D2, which was treated w ith terramycine, 15% 5 of the animals survived, m .t.d. was 6.53, which is statistically longer in the control A 2 group. The concentration of IL-1 increased 16-fold by day 3 of the disease and stayed at this level until the day 7. The concentration of TNF increased 2-fold by day 6 of the disease. The levels of the cytokines in the serum of the animals in this group were statistically lower than in the control 10 group A2. CONCLUSIONS: 1. AU preparations used in the experiment for treatm ent decrease the production of the cytokines: the effect is more pronounced on TNF and than on IL-1, and results in increased survival of the animals in all treated groups. 15 2. The most effective preparation was tetracycline, particularly soluble tetracycline. EXAMPLE 5 TREATMENT OF THE DENGUE VIRUS INFECTION WITH VARIOUS TETRACYCLINES AND SERUM 20 Virus. Dengue virus, type 2. All work w ith infectious virus was performed in the maximum-containment biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) of the SRC VB HVector)). This virus was amplified in the brain of the suckling mice and was collected to produce stocks. This stock virus suspension was stored at -40C, contained 6.8 25 LD5 0 /ml (in the mice BALB/c by intraperitoneal challenge). For infecting mice we used 5 LD5 0 virus. Animals. 4-week-old BALB/c mice (haplotype H-2d) were used in the experiments w ith Dengue virus. Mice had weigh 12-14 gram. The animals were received from 30 the vivarium of SRC VB ((Vector)) and kept on a standard ration. RT-PCR procedure. Primers for Dengue virus type 2 'AAGGAACGCCACCAAGGCCATG (position 237-258) SEQ ID No. 24. RNA was extracted from the serum of the infected animals (mice) by means of RNeasy Kits (Quiagen, Germany). For RT-PCR Titan-Kits (Berhringer, 5 Germany) were used. Reverse transcription was conducted at 42C for 60 min, followed by 40 amplification cycles at 94C for 30 sec, at 55 C for 1 min, and at 68 C for 2 min, w ith a final extension at 68 C for 7 min. Am plification was conducted in 0.2-m l tubes w ith a model BIS-105M thermocycler (Russia). The virus detection was provided by PCR on the second day after animals infection. 10 Experimental Scheme Mice of all groups were infected by 5 LD5 0 of Dengue virus. Groups A - control groups (only virus). Group A l - 20 mice control for mortality. Group A2 - 30 mice - was used for obtaining blood samples on day (0) and on 15 days 1, 3, 5 and 6 post infection. The blood samples were obtained from the orbital sinuses (at every time point 3 mice were used for harvesting blood). AU blood samples (500 each) were frozen at -70\u00b0 C. A fter completion of the experiment, the concentrations of TNF- and IL-IyS were measured. Groups B, 36 mice, was the Human serum treatm ent group. 20 Treatment was carried out w ith the Human serum stimulated by Vibromycine. The Human serum was obtained from the blood of a human administered vibromycine (150 mg) orally tw ice a day (every 12 hours). The human blood was taken on the second and the third day after the beginning of the stim ulation. The concentration in the human serum of IL-1 RA was 184 pg/ml, and the 25 concentration of sTNFRI was 950 pg/ml. Treatment of the mice commenced on the third day after viral infecting of the mice and continued until day 8. It was administered intraperitonealy tw ice a day in the volume of 200 per dose. The dose of the infusing human serum is about 16% of the blood volume of a mouse. 30 Groups B Group BI - control for m ortality. 10 mice. WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -117 - Group B2 - 26 mice - was used for obtaining blood samples on day (0) and days 1, 3, 5 and 12 post infection. Blood samples were obtained from the orbital sinuses (at every time point 3 mice were used for harvesting blood). AU blood samples (500 ) were frozen and -70\u00b0 C. A fter completion of the experiment, 5 the concentrations of TNF - a and IL-Iyff were measured. Groups C - Tetracycline treatm ent groups. Treatment w ith Tetracycline hydrochloride (10 /vg in a volume of 30 ) was carried out from the third day after virus infection until day 8, tw ice per day, orally. Tetracycline is more soluble than vibromycine so that is could be 10 administered more readily in solution to the mice. Group C l - control for m ortality. 20 mice. Group C2- 30 mice - was used for obtaining blood samples on day (0) and days 1, 3, 5, 6 and 12 post infection. Blood samples were obtained from the orbital sinuses (at every tim e point 3 mice were used for harvesting blood). 15 AU blood samples (500 each) were frozen -70\u00b0 C. A fter completion of the experiment, the concentrations of TNF-, and IL-Iyff were measured. Groups D. Control for human serum treatm ent groups. The control for treatm ent was human serum obtained from the human before the Vibromycine stimulation. This \"normal\" human serum contained 2 0 24.4 pg/ml of IL-1 RA and 25.0 pg/ml of sTNFRI. The volume dose and method of infusion were the same as during the Human serum treatm ent course. Treatment w ith the normal human serum commenced on the third day after virus infection until day 7, tw ice per day, intraperitonealy in a volume of 200 per dose. The dose of the infusing normal human serum was about 16% of the 25 blood volume of a mouse. Group D1- 10 mice - control for mortality. Group D2 - 26 mice - was used for obtaining blood samples on day (0) and days 1, 3, 5 and 6 post infection. Blood samples were obtained from the orbital sinuses (at every time point 3 mice were used for harvesting blood). AU 3 0 blood samples (500) were frozen at -70\u00b0 C. After completion of the experiment, the concentrations of TNF- and IL-Iyff were measured. WO 00/64479 PCT/USOO/117O0 -118 - E. Treatment w ith anti-TNFa serum. Group E1 -1 0 mice. For treatm ent rabbit serum prepared against the human TNF- was used. The neutralizing activity of this rabbit's serum was 1 ng/ml. 5 Treatment w ith anti-TNF- serum commenced on the third day after virus infection until day 7, tw ice per day, intraperitonealy in a volume of 200 \\ per dose. The dose of the infusing anti-TNF- serum represented 16% of the blood volume of a mouse. Group E2-10 mice. 10 The treatm ent w ith the normal rabbit serum was carried out from the third day after virus infection until day 6, tw ice per day, intraperitonealy in a volume of 200 \\ per dose. The dose of the infusing normal rabbit serum represented 16% of the blood volume of a mouse. Results 15 The results of the experiments show that the oral administration of Tetracycline (groups C) for the treatm ent of the experimental Dengue fever in mice (20 mg, daily) prolongs (statistically significant) the lifetim e of the animals, and increases (statistically significant) the number of the surviving mice (Table 14). The data (see Table below shows that treatm ent considerably reduces 20 inflammatory cytokines such as TNFo and IL-1/? (Table 15). Treatment w ith stimulated human serum (groups B) containing the increased concentrations of the stimulated human serum (groups B) containing the increased concentrations of the receptors of the cytokines also prolonged the lifetime of the mice, and increased the number of surviving animals. The results of the treatm ent by the 25 normal human serum (groups D) did not reveal any significant differences from the results in the Control group A. Hence this data demonstrates the essential role of TNFo in the development of the experimental Dengue fever. These results are further confirmed by the results of the anti-TNFo serum treatm ent (group E1). In this group 60% of all animals survived and the lifetime 30 was significantly higher.

In the animals of the group B treated by w ith SERUM 1, which contains antibodies against Marburg virus and 15 soluble receptors sTNFR and IL-IRA, a tendency of increasing survival of animals was observed and the prolongation of lifetime was statistically significant. Human soluble receptors (sTNFRI and IL-IRA) were detected in the blood samples of the treated guinea pigs on day (0) before infecting (as a control) and on day 7 after infecting w ith the Marburg virus, and on the 27th day among the 20 survived guinea pigs. The detection was performed using ELISA-kits of R&D Production. The human soluble receptors sTNFRI and IL-IRA were detected in the blood of the animals. W ithout being bound by any theory, it appears that these receptors were used for the neutralization of the inflam m atory cytokines produced during the development of the Marburg fever in the animals. The 25 serum of the surviving guinea pigs after Marburg infection was used for the detection of the specific IgG by ELISA and Western blot (groups of guinea pigs A,B,C) on days (0), 27 and 35. On day ((0)) no specific IgG was detected. But on day 27 and 35 the specific antibodies against Marburg virus were found at a titer of 1 :80. A t the same tim e no antibodies against Ebola virus were detected. 30 WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -124 - It appears from the combination of the low tite r of the antibodies against the Marburg virus w ith a sufficient concentrations of the soluble receptors of the inflammatory cytokines can influence the development and outcome of the experimental Marburg fever. 5 EXAMPLE 7 TREATMENT OF E. COLI INFECTION Bacterial strain. Eterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), O 157:H7 strain, serotype 105282 was used these experiments. The organisms were incubated in LB medium for 10 24 h ar 37 C. A fter one passage viable counts were determined by plating on the agar media. Titer of E.coli was 108 PFU. E.coli suspension was prepared by washing the bacterial pellet tw ice in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Dosage and method of infecting. 15 The bacterial suspension ( 107 PFU) in the volume of 30 \\ was infused to the mice intragastricaly through the soft polyethylene catheter. Mice. 4-week-old male BALB/c mice (halpotype H-2d) were used in the experiments. The blood volume per mouse was approximately 1.2 ml. AU animals were divided into the follow ing groups. 20 Groups A. Control groups. All animals were infected by E.coli suspension. Group A-1, 10 mice, control for m ortality. Group A2, 20 mice, was used to obtain blood samples on day \" 0\" and day 1, 2, 3, 5 post-infection. Blood samples were obtained from the orbital sinuses (on every time point 3 mice were used for harvesting blood). All blood samples (500 25 \\ each) were frozen -70C. A fte r the whole experiment had finished, the concentrations of TNF,IL-1 were measured. Groups B. Treatment groups (BI and B2). Treatment was carried out w ith the Human serum containing IL-RA and sTNFRI. The Human serum was obtained from the blood of human taking orally 30 Vibromycine in dose of 150 mg tw ice per day (every 12 hours). The Human blood was taken on the second day and the third day after the beginning of taking antibiotic. The concentration in the Human serum of IL-1RA was 184 WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -125 - pg/ml, and the concentration of sTNFRI was 950 pg/ml. The treatm ent was started from the second day after bacterial infecting of the mice and continued until 9 day, tw ice per day, intraperitonealy, in the volume of 200 \\ per dose. The dose of the transfusing Human serum presented 16% of the blood volume 5 of a mouse. Group B I, 10 mice, control for m ortality. Group B2, 26 mice, was used from obtaining blood samples on day \"0 \" and day 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 21 post infection. Blood samples were obtained from the orbital sinuses (on every tim e point 3 mice were used for harvesting blood). AU blood 10 samples (500 \\ each) were frozen -70\u00b0 C. A fter the whole experiment had finished, the concentrations of TNF,IL-1 were measured. Groups C. Control for Treatm ent groups. Treatment was carried out w ith the ((Normal)) Human serum. The concentration in the ((Normal)) Human serum of IL-1RA was 24.4 pg/ml, 15 and the concentration of sTNFRI was 22 pg/ml. The concentration of IL-Iyff pg/ml, the concentration of TNFo - 7.6 pg/ml. The treatm ent was started from the second day after bacterial infecting of the mice and continued until 7 day, tw ice per day, intraperitonealy, in the volume of 200 \\ per dose. The does of the transfusing Normal Human serum presented 16% of the blood volume of a 20 mouse. AU animals dies on day 7 after bacterial infection. Group C l, 10 mice, control m ortality. Group C2, 26 mice, was used to obtain blood samples on day \"0 \" and day 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 post infection. Samples were obtaining from the orbital sinuses (on every time point 3 mice were used for harvesting blood). AU blood samples (500 25 \\ each) were frozen - 70 C. A fte r the whole experiment had finished, the concentrations of TFNo, IL-Iyff were measured. Results The results of the experiments show th a t infecting the mice w ith a pathogenic strain of E. coli leads to the death of all mice. The clinical m anifestations of the 30 experimental disease caused by this strain of E. coli have many common features w ith the experimental fevers in animals such as Dengue, Lassa, and Machupo. The presence of sepsis in the infected animals was confirmed by WO 00/64479 PCT/USOO/11700 -126 - demonstrating E. coli in the blood of the animals on the 6th day after infecting while it was not present before infecting. AU infected mice showed intensified production of TNFa and IL-1/?. Infusion of normal nonstimulated human serum had no effect on the levels of inflam m atory cytokines nor did it prolong the 5 lifetime of the animals or the number of survivors. Treatment w ith vibromycine stimulated human serum that contained resulting higher concentrations of sTNFRI and IL-1RA provides a statistically significant prolongation of lifetim e of the infected mice, the survival of 4 of 10 mice and a decrease in production of the cytokines as sTNFRI and IL-1RA. 10 Table. 17 The effects o f the treatm ent of the experim ental bacterial shock Group Scheme o f treatm ent Survived/died m .t.d .

Obtaining cells. The mononuclear cells were obtained from the human blood. The human 15 blood was taken into the tubes w ith Heparin (5 ED heparin/ml) and centrifuged on Hustopaqe (p = 1.077), 1000 x g, 30 minutes. Mononuclear cells were washed tw ice in the medium RPMI-1640 (pH 7.2). Cells' concentration compiled 5x106 /ml. 2. Cells activation 20 One part of the obtained cells was used like control, w ithout any activation (in volume 2 ml). The second part was used for the Tetracycline activation w ith dosage of 0.06 mg/ml (in volume 2 ml). The third part was used for the Terramycine activation w ith the dosage of 0.06 mg/ml (2 ml). The activation continued 2 hours, after w hat the cells were 25 washed tw ice w ith the medium RPMI-1640 (pH 7.2). The monolayer was formed (2X106 /ml). The cells were cultivated at 37\u00b0C , 95% of humidity, atmosphere of 5% of CO2. The samples of the activated mononuclear cells were taken on the third, 6th and 24th hours after the beginning of the contact. 30 The concentrations of sTNFRI and IL-1 RA were measured using standard ELISA-kits by R@D Systems. WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -128 - This experiment shows that the production of the receptors such as sTNFRi and IL-1 RA can be induced in vitro using Tetracycline and Terramycine. In our It appears that production is possible because of the direct influence of the antibiotics on the mononuclear cells. The production of the receptors by the 5 activated cells is statistically significantly higher than the production by the non\u00ad stimulated cells. The concentrations of the receptors obtained in vitro are comparable w ith the concentrations obtained in vivo and even higher. A fter the Vibromycine stimulation the concentrations of the receptors in the donors serum (2 persons, 10 on the 24th hour) were IL-1 RA 126.8 + 6.8 pg/ml, sTNFRi 970 + 28.6 pg/ml (before the stim ulation: IL-1 RA 20 + 2.2 pg/ml and + 3.4 pg/ml). After the Tetracycline stim ulation the concentrations of the same receptors in the donors serum (2 persons, on the 24th hour): 1 30 + 6.8 pg/ml and 580 + 1 8.2 pg/ml. 15 Table 19 20 25 30Dynamics of the concentrations of IL-1 RA and sTNFRi Cells Flours IL-1 RA pg/mlsTNFRi pg/ml Cells 0 27 + 1.4 18 + 1.6 3 40 + 3.2 68 + 4.8 6 58 + 4.6 44 + 3.2 24 44 + 3.4 22 + 2.1 Cells + Terramycine 0 28 + 1.6 18 + 1.4 3 93 + 6.2 313 + 10.4 6 220 + 9.4 224 + 9.2 24 185 + 8.6 264 + 9.6 Cells + Tetracycline 0 22 + 1.4 19+1.2 3 86 + 4.6 185 + 8.4 WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -129 - 6 186 + 8.2 204 + 9.2 24 140 + 7.6 201 + 8.6 EXAMPLE 9 5 IN VITRO ACTIVATION OF MONONUCLEAR HUMAN CELLS BY ANTIBIOTICS 1 . Cells Mononuclear cells were obtained from human blood, which had been collected in tubes w ith Heparin (5 ED heparin/ml) and centrifuged on Hustopaqe (p = 1.077), 1000 x g, 30 minutes. Mononuclear cells were washed tw ice with 10 RPMI-1640 medium (pH 7.2). The concentration of the cells was 5x106 /ml. 2. Activation of cells One portion of the cells was used as control, w ithout any activation (in a volume 2 ml). A second portion was used for the tetracycline activation at a concentration of 0.06 mg/ml (in a volume of 2 ml). The third portion was used 15 for the terramycine activation at a concentration of 0.06 mg/ml (in a volume of 2 ml). The activation continued for 2 hours, and the cells then were washed tw ice w ith the medium RPMI-1640 (pH 7.2). A monolayer was formed (2 X 106/ml) and the cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0 C, 95% humidity, atmosphere of 5% of CO2. Samples of activated mononuclear cells were taken on the third, 6th and 24th 20 hours after the beginning of the contact. The concentrations of sTNFRi and IL-1 RA were measured using standard ELISA- kits by R&D Systems. The results of the experiment showed that the production of the receptors such as sTNFRi and IL-1 RA are induced in vitro using Tetracycline and 25 Terramycine. The production of the receptors by the activated cells was statistically significantly higher than the production by the non-stimulated cells. The concentrations of the receptors obtained in vitro are comparable to the concentrations obtained in vivo and even higher. For example, after vibromycine stimulation, the concentration of receptors in the donor serum (2 persons, on the 30 24th hour) were IL-1 RA 126.8 \u00b1 6.8 3.4 pg/ml). A fte rth e tetracycline stimulation the concentrations of the same receptors in the donor WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -130 - serum (2 persons, at the 24th hour) was 130 \u00b1 6.8 pg/ml and 580 \u00b1 1 8.2 pg/ml.

Preparation of plasma from tetracycline-injected Mice Sixty 7-8 week old female Balb/c mice (H2 '4 haplotype) were injected intramuscularly w ith tetracycline (58 mg/kilo in 0.1 ml of sterile PBS). Plasma (citrated) was collected from these mice at 24 hour postinjection. One 0.2 ml 25 sample of the plasma from each mouse was tested for the presence of IL-1 R and TNFa-RI&ll. The reminder of the plasma from each mouse was pooled. A fter removing a small sample from this pool for testing for the above mentioned cytokines, the reminder of the plasma pool was stored at -8 5 0C until needed. Thirty 7-8 week old female Balb/c mice (H2d) were injected w ith 0.1 ml of 30 sterile PBS and their plasma was drawn at 24 hour postinjection.

The remainder of the plasma from this group of mice was pooled. A sample of the pooled plasma was tested for the cytokines as described above. 2. Treatment of the mice w ith septic shock 5 Fifty 6-8 week old female Balb/c mice (Haplotype as above) received concurrent intraperitoneal injections of 25 /yg of Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) and 20 mg of galactosamine for the induction of Septic Shock. The mice were divided into the following treatm ent groups: 1) ten mice remained untreated and served as negative controls; 10 2) ten mice received an intramuscular injection of tetracycline (58 mg/kilo) on the day of induction, and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postinduction. These mice also received tw ice daily injections of 0.3 ml of plasma from mice treated w ith tetracycline on the day of induction and on days 1,2,3 and 4 postinduction; 3) ten mice received 0.3 ml of plasma from tetracycline-injected mice tw ice 15 daily on the day of induction and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postinduction; 4) ten mice received intramuscular injection of tetracycline and 0.3 ml of plasma from tetracycline-injected mice once daily on the day of induction and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postinduction; and 5) ten mice received 0.3 ml of plasma from PBS-injected mice tw ice daily on 20 the day of induction and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postinduction. Ten mice were not induced for septic shock and served as normal controls. M ortality among all groups of animals was recorded four tim es daily for 4 days (96 hours) postinduction. 25 AU mice w ithout the induced septic shock survived 96 hours postinduction. None of the mice w ith the septic shock treated w ith control plasma, i.e., plasma prepared from PBS-infected mice, survived 36 hours postinduction. About 20% of the mice w ith septic shock that were treated w ith either tetracycline or tetracycline-stim ulated plasma alone survived 96 hours 30 postinduction. About 40% of the mice w ith septic shock that were treated w ith WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -132 - tetracycline and tetracycline-stim ulated plasma survived 96 postinduction. Therefore, combination therapy of tetracycline and tetracycline-stim ulated plasma boosts the survival rate of the mice w ith the SEB-induced septic shock. EXAMPLE 11 5 Effects of Plasma from Tetracycline-injected on the Outcome of Septic Shock in Mice and protocols for testing of treatment hemorrhagic fevers in a rodent model Individuals infected w ith gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi develop a characteristic syndrome that includes acidosis, fever, hypotension, lactate release into the tissues, disseminated intravascular 10 coagulation (DIC) and renal, hepatic and lung injury. These infections and the resulting syndrome can induce a lethal condition called septic shock (SS). Numerous studies have established that this pathologic picture is attributable almost entirely to secretion of TNFa by endotoxin-stimulated macrophages. Mouse DIC and SS models 15 Balb/c mice sensitized by administration of D-galactosamine and injected intraperitoneally w ith Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) are a well-established model for human septic shock w ith accompanying disseminated intravascular coagulation. This process is driven by the release of TNFa and IL-1 by antigen- stimulated macrophages. In this mouse model, death usually occurring within 20 24 hr of antigen challenge. Phase I 1. Sixty, 7-8 week old female Balb/c mice (Fl2 '4 haplotype) are injected intramuscularly w ith tetracycline (58 mg/kilo in 0.1 ml of sterile PBS). 2. Plasma (citrated) is collected from these mice at 24 hr 25 postinjection. One 0.2 ml sample of plasma from each mouse is set aside for testing for the presence of IL-1 R and TNFa-RI&ll, the reminder of the plasma from each mouse is pooled. A fte r removing a small sample from this pool for testing for the cytokines of interest, such as IL-1 an TNFa, the reminder of the plasma pool is be stored at -8 5 0C until needed. 30 3. Thirty, 7-8 week old female Balb/c mice (FI2d) are injected in w ith 0.1 ml of sterile PBS and their plasma drawn at 24 hr postinjection. A sample of plasma from each mouse w ill be tested for IL-1 R and TNFa-RI&ill and the WO 00/64479PCT/US00/11700 -133 - remainder of the plasma from this group of mice will be pooled. A sample of the pooled plasma will be tested for cytokines as above. Phase Il 1.

These mice also receive tw ice daily injections of 0.3 ml of plasma from mice treated w ith tetracycline on 10 the day of induction and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postinduction. 10 mice receive 0.3 ml of plasma from tetracycline-injected mice tw ice daily on the day of induction and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postinduction. 10 mice receive im injection of tetracycline and 0.3 ml of serum from tetracycline injected mice once daily on the day of induction and on days 1,2,3 15 and 4 postinduction. 10 mice receive 0.3 ml of serum from PBS-injected mice tw ice daily on the day of induction and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postinduction. 2. Ten mice as described above are not treated for induction of Septic Shock and will serve as normal controls. 20 3. M ortality among all groups of animals is recorded four tim es daily.

EXAMPLE 12 ASSAYS FOR TNF and IL-1 RECEPTORS 25 Assays for IL-1 receptors Numerous bioassays used to detect and quantitate IL-IRa are known. An assay used herein to determine IL-IRa in blood and blood-derived fractions that have been treated w ith tetracycline or tetracycline-like compounds is the Quantikine IL-Ira Immunoassay, which is solid phase ELISA designed to measure 30 IL-IRa in cell culture supernate, serum, and plasma. It contains \u00a3.co//'-derived recombinant human IL-IRa as well as antibodies raised against the recombinant factor. This immunoassay has been shown to accurately quantitate the WO 00/64479PCT/USOO/11700 -135 - recombinant human IL-I ra. Results obtained during natural human IL-Ira showed linear curves that were parallel to the standard curves obtained using the \u00a3.co//-expressed Quantikine kit standards. These results indicate that the Quantikine Immunoassay kit can be used to determine relative mass values for 5 natural human IL-1 ra. Principle of the assay This assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. A monoclonal antibody specific for IL-IRa has been pre-coated onto a microplate. Standards and samples are pipetted into the wells and any IL-IRa 10 present is bound by the immobilized antibody. A fter washing away any unbound substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for IL-IRa is added to the wells. Following a wash to remove any unbound antibody-enzyme reagent, a substrate solution is added to the wells and color develops in proportion to the amount of IL-IRa bound in the initial step. The color development is stopped 15 and the intensity of the color is measured. Assays for TNFs Bioassays for sTNFR Il typically involves measurement of the inhibitory effect of the soluble receptor on the cytotoxic activity TNF- on a susceptible cell line. The Quantikine human sTNF Rl Immunoassay is a solid phase ELISA 20 designed to measure sTNF Rl in cell culture supernate, serum, plasma and urine. It contains \u00a3. co//-expressed, recombinant human sTNF Rl, as well as antibodies raised against this polypeptide. The recombinant protein represents the non- giycosylated, N-terminal methionyl form of the naturally occurring human soluble Type I receptor for TNF w ith an apparent molecular weight of approximately 25 18.6 kDa. This immunoassay has been shown to accurately quantitate the recombinant sTNF Rl. Results obtained on samples containing natural sTNF Rl showed linear curves that were parallel to the standard curves obtained using the Quantikine kit standards. These results indicate that Quantikine Immunoassay kit can be used to determine relative mass values of natural sTNF 30 Rl. Since the measurement of human sTNF Rl by this immunoassay is relatively insensitive to added TNF- or TNF-/?, it is probable that this measurement corresponds to the total amount of the soluble receptor present in samples, i.e., WO 00/64479 PCT/US00/11700 -136 - the total amount of free receptor plus the total amount of receptor bound to TNF. Principle of the assay This assay employs the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay 5 technique. A monoclonal antibody specific for sTNF Rl has been pre-coated onto a microplate. Standards and samples are pipetted into the wells an any sTNF Rl present is bound by the immobilized antibody. A fter washing away any unbound substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for sTNF Rl is added to the wells. Following a wash to remove any unbound antibody-enzyme 10 reagent, a substrate solution is added to the wells and color develops in proportion to the amount of sTNF Rl bound in the initial step. The color development is stopped and the intensity of the color is measured.

The claims cover a ll compounds having th is characteristics or properties, whereas the application provides support within the meaning of A rticle 6 P C T and/or disclosure within the meaning of A rtic le 5 P C T fo r only a very lim ited number of such compounds. In the present case, the claims so lack support, and the application so lacks disclosure, that a meaningful search over the whole of the claimed scope is impossible. Independent of the above reasoning, the claims also lack c la rity (A rticle 6 PCT). A n attempt is m ade to define the compound by reference to a pharmacological property. Again, this lack of c la rity in the present case is such as to render a meaningful search over the whole of the claimed scope impossible. Moreover, \"the unmeasured cytokine or receptor\" of claim I has not been defined. Consequently, the search has been carried out fo r those parts of the claims which appear to be clear, supported and disclosed, namely those parts relating to the tetracyclines mentioned in claim 13, with due regard to the general idea underlying the present invention. Claims searched completely: 13,33,40. Claims searched incompletely: I \u2014 12, 14\u2014 32, 34\u2014 39,41\u2014 63. The applicant' s attention is drawn to the fact that claims, or parts of claims, relating to inventions in respect of which no international search report has been established need not be the subject of an international preliminary examination (Rule 66.1(e) PCT). The applicant is advised that the E P O policy when acting as an International Preliminary Examining Authority is normally not to carry out a preliminary examination on matter which has not been searched. This is the case irrespective of whether or not the claims are am ended following receipt of the search report or during any Chapter I I procedure.
