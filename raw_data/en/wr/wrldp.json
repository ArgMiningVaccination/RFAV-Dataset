What is TFT? TFT is an extremely effective tapping technique that provides a code to unlock nature's healing system, bringing rapid relief to all kinds of emotional and psychological distresses. It's a drug free, gentle and non-invasive method of literally tapping into the body's energy system to allow natural healing. Dr Roger Callahan (creator and developer of TFT), a distinguished American Clinical Psychologist, discovered TFT nearly thirty years ago. Dr Callahan suggests that whenever we think of anything we 'tune in' to an individual 'thought field' and when we feel distressed, there is a disruption or 'perturbation' in the thought field that triggers that distress. By tapping on specific sequences of acupuncture points along the body's meridian energy lines, while thinking about the issues causing the distress, the perturbations can be eliminated and the distress can start to disappear within minutes. With a success rate of up to 95% and a permanence rate of up to 99% TFT is rapidly growing in notability throughout the UK with therapist and public alike and has been used with great success by Paul McKenna on Sky One's \"I Can Change Your Life\" and \"Paul McKenna Will Make You Thin\". \"If you can't change something, change the way you feel about it\" TFT is simple and is carried out fully clothed by the client while guided by the practitioner. With practice TFT can be used by anyone wherever and whenever needed, including children and the elderly. The results are almost instantaneous and frequently amaze those who try it. TFT has proven extremely effective with, but not restricted to the following issues: Weight Management Quitting Smoking Stress & Anxiety Panic Attacks Depression Jealousy Grief Trauma & PTSD Anger & Rage Sleep Problems Unwanted Habits Fears & Phobias Addictions Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Pain Management Confidence & Self Esteem Irritable Bowel Syndrome Children's Behavioural Problems Dental & Doctor Fear Rejection & Love Pain And other life-limiting problems that stifle happiness and personal performance. STOP PRESS!The UK National Health Service have formally accepted TFT onto their list of therapies for practitioner listing in the NHS Directory of Complementary and Alternative Practitioners. "}
