Typically, doctors treat epilepsy with anti-seizure medicines. However, some people don't respond to medications or don't want to deal with the side effects. They may wonder whether natural and alternative therapies may be a way to complement or replace traditional medications. Though there are many epilepsy natural treatments available, not all of them are supported by scientific research and some pose risks of their own. Talking to your healthcare provider before trying any epilepsy treatment is important, whether it's a conventional medication or an alternative therapy. Additionally, many natural remedies are intended for use along with standard medicines and should never take the place of anti-seizure drugs. This article discusses the different types of natural treatments for epilepsy, the research backing these therapies, and the risks involved. Songsak rohprasit / Getty Images. How Many People With Epilepsy Fail to Respond to Medicines? Studies show about 32% of people with epilepsy are drug-resistant, meaning they don't respond to medication. Dietary Changes Some people with epilepsy have been able to reduce the frequency of their seizures by making dietary changes. One of the most popular is the ketogenic diet for epilepsy. It involves only eating foods that are high in fats and low in carbohydrates. Though this diet has proved it can reduce seizure frequency in some individuals, it's very restrictive and often difficult to follow. Healthcare providers typically recommend the classic ketogenic diet for children who don't respond to standard medicine and a less restrictive modified Atkins diet for adults. A 2020 review of four studies showed more than half of children with treatment-resistant epilepsy who follow the ketogenic diet stopped having seizures, and 85% had a reduction in the number of seizures. However, the evidence was of very low quality. What Are the Side Effects of a Ketogenic Diet? Side effects of a ketogenic diet may include:High cholesterolDehydrationKidney stonesConstipationSlowed growthDecreased bone mineral density and increased risk of fractures How Nutrition Affects Epilepsy Management Vitamins and Minerals Anticonvulsant drugs for treating epilepsy can affect the absorption and effects of vitamins and minerals. This may lead to deficiencies in these key nutritional components. Talking to your healthcare provider before adding a supplement is important. Most often, vitamins and minerals supplement standard treatments. Your healthcare provider can determine if you have a vitamin or mineral deficiency and advise you on your efforts to correct it. Taking too much of some vitamins and minerals may interfere with medications or increase the risk of seizures. Magnesium Some studies have shown that people with epilepsy have lower levels of magnesium than those who don't have the disorder. There have been case reports suggesting seizures can be controlled with magnesium supplements in certain people. However, scientists say more research is necessary to better understand magnesium's role in controlling seizures. Pregnant people with preeclampsia (a condition of high blood pressure) get magnesium sulfate infusions after they give birth to prevent seizures. Vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 use is common in people with a type of epilepsy known as pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, which results from the body's inability to metabolize vitamin B6 effectively. However, more studies are necessary to determine how well the supplement works and if people with other types of epilepsy can benefit from it. Vitamin E Some people with epilepsy have a vitamin E deficiency. Studies have shown vitamin E supplementation may improve seizure control. However, more research is necessary to confirm its effectiveness. Herbal Remedies Herbal medicines are plant extracts that can treat different health concerns. Though there's no solid research showing that herbs are effective for people with epilepsy, some people anecdotally report improvement. Certain herbs can interact with other medicines or cause unwanted side effects, so talking to your healthcare provider before taking them is important. Regulation of Vitamin and Herbal Supplements It's important to know that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates vitamin and herbal supplements as food rather than drugs. They can arrive on the market without the FDA's approval of their safety, effectiveness, or labeling. The FDA reviews product labels and inspects manufacturing facilities for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) only after these products are marketed. Herbs to Try Various cultures and traditional medicines have treated seizures with herbs, but none have enough research to confirm they are safe and effective. Some of the more common herbal supplements for treating epilepsy include: Kava: Can damage the liver, so use only under medical supervision Bacopa: Used in Ayurvedic medicine Chamomile Valerian Passionflower Herbs to Avoid Certain herbs that may interact with seizure medications or make seizures worse include: Ginkgo bilobaGinsengSt. John's wortGamma-linolenic acid (GLA, evening primrose oil and borage oil)White willow Avoiding Triggers Avoiding epilepsy triggers can prevent or reduce the number of seizures you experience. Some common triggers include: StressLack of sleepSkipping medicationsAlcohol or drug useMenstruationA cold or sinus infectionExposure to bright or flashing lights Stress Relief Some people find that stress-relieving strategies can help reduce the number of seizures they experience. Nearly nine out of 10 people who actively manage their stress levels believe it reduces their risk of seizures. Meditation One study found that mindfulness meditation techniques combined with psychotherapy may help people with drug-resistant epilepsy more than psychotherapy alone. The combined treatments improved quality of life and reduced seizure frequency. However, the research is limited on meditation for epilepsy. Some scientists are skeptical that it works or even speculate that meditation could worsen epilepsy in certain situations. Massage Massage can relieve muscle tension and reduce stress, and some people with epilepsy sometimes use it. It's a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider before receiving a massage if you have epilepsy. Yoga Yoga is an ancient meditative practice that involves performing different poses, stretches, and breathing exercises. One small study found that people with epilepsy who practiced yoga reported a reduction in seizures and the amount of medicine needed to treat epilepsy. But a large review revealed insufficient evidence to support using yoga as the sole alternative therapy for epilepsy. Though the practice may help induce relaxation when combined with other treatments, researchers say more trials are necessary to understand how effective yoga is for epilepsy. Reflexology Reflexology is a special type of massage based on the idea that different areas of the body correspond to points on the feet. Though limited research has suggested the technique may reduce seizures when applied with standard treatments, there isn't enough evidence to show it's effective. Biofeedback Biofeedback is a mind-body therapy that can help a person improve their physical or mental health. During a biofeedback session, a person is hooked up to electrical sensors that measure specific bodily functions, such as heart rate, temperature, and breathing. There's some evidence that biofeedback can help reduce the frequency of seizures. However, rigorous research showing the benefits of biofeedback for epilepsy is limited. Vagus Nerve Stimulation Vagus nerve stimulation is a treatment that involves implanting a battery-powered device, called a stimulator, underneath the skin near the chest. The stimulator sends electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to the brain. Studies show up to half of people who undergo this treatment report that their seizures are less severe. Vagus nerve stimulation is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat focal or partial seizures that don't respond to medicines in adults and children 4 years and older. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves inserting very thin needles into specific points in the body. The research on acupuncture for seizures has shown mixed results. However, some studies have suggested that acupuncture could reduce stress and anxiety, which may reduce seizures in some people. If you decide to have acupuncture, find a qualified practitioner and let your healthcare provider know you're receiving the treatments. Chiropractic Care Some chiropractors apply spinal manipulation techniques to help people with seizures. Though case studies and anecdotal reports suggest these methods may offer some benefits, there isn't any hard research to prove chiropractic care can treat seizures. CBD and Cannabis Some studies have shown cannabis or cannabidiol (CBD) products may help reduce seizures in adults and children. However, other research has suggested these products are ineffective treatments for epilepsy. The FDA has approved Epidiolex (cannabidiol), a cannabis-based CBD drug, to treat seizures caused by two rare forms of epilepsy. This medicine is only available with a prescription and can cause side effects, such as sedation, elevated liver enzymes, loss of appetite, sleep problems, fatigue, weakness, rash, or infections. The legalization of cannabis and CBD in several jurisdictions has led many people with epilepsy to consider it as a treatment option. However, there is limited research on whether it is effective in forms of epilepsy other than those for which Epidiolex is approved to treat. Also, over-the-counter CBD products vary widely in their quality, concentration, and inclusion of other cannabis-derived active ingredients. What appears on the label may prove inaccurate. CBD may also interact with anticonvulsant medications and other medications. Discuss any use of cannabis products with your healthcare provider. Talking to Your Healthcare Provider About Natural Treatments If you're interested in trying a natural treatment for epilepsy, talking to your healthcare provider first is vital. You might want to ask about which therapies would benefit your specific case most. You and your healthcare provider should discuss all of the risks and benefits that alternative options pose. Summary Several types of natural remedies may reduce seizures in people with epilepsy. Some of these include dietary changes, vitamins, herbs, stress-relieving methods, acupuncture, biofeedback, vagus nerve stimulation, chiropractic care, cannabis, and other treatments. Though some people find they help, hard research doesn't support most of these methods. Your healthcare provider can help you determine if a natural approach or combining treatment strategies is right for you. Frequently Asked Questions Is there a cure for epilepsy?
