If you struggle with complex psychological issues or trauma please only do these exercises under the supervision of a qualified TRE\u00ae practitioner. TRE\u00ae or Trauma and Tension Release Exercises, is a somatic body based practice for people suffering with stress, anxiety, trauma or PTSD. It doesn't require talking about an event, feeling or issue, therefore it overcomes the language barriers that can bring up added stress. TRE\u00ae includes a series of easy stretches using the muscles of the lower body and builds up a little shaking in the legs. Once the body is shaking, you lie on the floor, and encourage these natural vibrations to move through the body, without trying to control them. Most people enjoy the sensation of shaking; for some, they report a physical or emotional release, without becoming overwhelmed by the process. The TRE\u00ae mechanism, or shaking ability, exists in all mammals and humans. It is the body's most natural and organic way of unravelling contracted or tight stress patterns, as well as reducing the charge of stress hormones and unhealthy chemical build up, bringing the body back into it's natural balance and a stable condition. TRE\u00ae is recommended for anyone who is feeling stressed, anxious or traumatized (including those who have witnessed other people's trauma). It helps those who suffer from pain, inflammation or tightness in their body. It can also help people who have health, financial, family or housing concerns as well as addiction. If you have been involved in a vehicle or work place accident it can help to overcome the stress and trauma that comes with an accident. So in short, TRE\u00ae can help anyone who might be at a point in life where stress, overwhelm, anxiety and pain is compromising their health and wellbeing. After practicing TRE\u00ae people often use the words 'grounded', 'relaxed' and 'calmer' to describe their feelings. After a period of several months people have reported relief from illnesses such as Arthritis, Fibromyalgia, Eczema and IBS. People who suffer from migraines, headaches, back pain etc can experience relief from pain as well as relief from emotions like fear, anger, worry and anxiety. Every individual has their own history of trauma and stress which means that some people may require more sessions of TRE\u00ae with a practitioner and some are just able to learn it and then do the exercises by themselves. Once the technique is learned and regulated, it is recommended to continue with TRE\u00ae a few times a week (or when required) as a self-help tool for good health, resiliency and freedom from stress. Are You Experiencing A Long Term Pain Condition? Many people who have experienced trauma also suffer with persistent or chronic pain. Pain that has been present for more than 3 months is often, approximately 80%, related to altered functioning of the nervous system. Pain from whatever cause initially can get stuck in an 'ON' position and doesn't respond to the normal medications or physical therapy prescribed for pain. However, there is a solution to help you Change Your Pain.
