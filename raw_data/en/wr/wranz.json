Through the years, chemical control has been the number one method for weed killers.

Despite all the benefits of applying chemical weed killers, the harmful effects on the environment are a real concern. When choosing herbicides, watch for the following common toxic inorganic herbicides that can be hazardous to your family. 2,4-D 2,4-D is one of the most dangerous herbicides, but it's still used in parks, athletic fields, and crops. Its common name is dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. It's dangerous for the environment, wildlife, and people. Paraquat [Paraquat dichloride](https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/paraquat-dichloride) (which you might know it as Gramoxone) controls weeds in farmland and non-agricultural areas. This herbicide causes severe injury and even death. It is highly toxic and is not approved by the EPA for home use. Some professional landscapers use it, and they have to be certified to do so. Atrazine Atrazine is the [second most popular herbicide](https://www.epa.gov/caddis-vol2/herbicides) used in US agriculture, and it's found in many home-based weed killer products. It is linked with a variety of health concerns, [including](https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/6459/pesticides/atrazine) endocrine disruption, birth defects, and cancer. Glyphosate This is the most common ingredient in herbicides these days. It's used on farms and residential gardens and lawns. The first product to use this ingredient was Roundup in 1974. Since then, many herbicides have started using glyphosate. Although glyphosate is thought to be a less bad herbicide than many of its predecessors, it still it not safe. Maybe in a future article, we'll do a deep dive down into the rabbit hole that is [Monsanto/Bayer](https://bookshop.org/a/83261/9781324002048) and their legal battles over [glyphosate](https://www.holisticwithheidi.com/lifelong/the-411-of-glyphosate-and-why-we-should-avoid-it-with-kelly-ryerson-aka-glyphosate-girl), but for now, we'll just say that we do not recommend it as a truly non-toxic choice. It was listed as a [probable carcinogen](https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/) by the IARC and Monsanto has paid billions of dollars in damages in lost court cases in recent years. Bayer has even said it will be removing glyphosate from all of its consumer weed killers by 2023.

What Are Organic and Non-Toxic Herbicides? Here are some of the common ingredients used in non-toxic, natural weed killers. - Vinegar - Salt - Clove oil - Cinnamon - Rosemary - HEDTA iron - Potassium salts - Corn gluten - Citric acid/oil Considering these are fairly common ingredients that you likely have at home already, you might want to try and [make your own recipe](https://www.thefiltery.com/non-toxic-organic-diy-weed-killer/). However, if you don't want to go through that effort, there are natural lawn care brands that have tested and perfected their own formulations using various combinations and ratios of the above ingredients. We've listed those brands below. Selective vs. Non-Selective Weed Killers Before you choose which weed killer is best for you, there's one more important thing to be aware of. If you're going to be spraying weed killer over your lawn or wide swaths of your garden, you'll need to use a selective weed killer. This will ensure that the weeds are killed, but your lawn grass, flowers, and vegetables are not. Non-selective weed killers, on the other hand, can cause damage to your lawn and should only be used directly on the weeds you want to get rid of. We've included recommendations for both options.

Pollinators tend to be even more sensitive to the toxic effects of pesticides than humans and other animals. Not only are they an important part of our ecosystem as a whole, but they also are crucial to humans' food supply. All of that being said, here are a few more things you can do to protect all living things in your yard. 1. Don't Mow (Or Mow Less) Not mowing is quickly becoming a trendy thing to do, as citizens realize that preserving the health of our environment is more important than \"keeping up with the Joneses\" with a perfectly clean-cut lawn. Consider participating in [no-mow May](https://beecityusa.org/no-mow-may/), or better yet \u2014 quit mowing altogether and start a pollinator-friendly yard that the bees and butterflies can benefit from all spring and summer. (More on that in a minute.) Of course, some municipalities and HOAs have rules about what your lawn is supposed to look like, so depending on where you live, it might be more difficult for you to get away with not mowing. ( [One couple](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/climate/native-plants-lawns-homeowners.html?unlocked_article_code=sr_ad-hbskpS-x3wTDtu9w_IWcla-_nto2l0n-of90fM5jfnMb7FbEtFwhxyDZy86NTGynHaEBxhEIqnu-Y6U5PVtAS1O2KZIfMf27y1Sz767DkP8FX8jUeWJdPHeCV-p_5_DjLQQ8nHhSXRromnV-jaArA0V8QlMBaIFFZfmzJFOSmBLZwIKm2q1hw0ye81D0FEHJfIDNqm_wXEJXO-_qH-bfyN1Sm1XUZyhp4xBLkpkn6C8J71x3njnO7Y-k1pmohD1h3VRPOTFhLEl2MkeOCTqqKG40SvAgWwx-BUfPu5VJwQJKd574Z0XWSkjVnNEJW2oC5XyytupuEvOyMkYedkLr1sDlTltg&smid=url-share) in Maryland actually went through a legal battle after their HOA told them to remove their wildlife-friendly garden. The lawsuit actually ended up changing the law in Maryland so that HOAs can no longer force homeowners to have lawns. Well done, Crouches!) But even mowing less often can help. Grasses that are a few inches longer can help slow weed growth without the use of pesticides simply by providing more shade for weed roots. Longer grass can also help the blades grow deeper roots, which aids in a more resilient lawn overall. 2. Choose Native Grass or Other Ground Cover Choose grasses and other plants that are native to your area. They will probably be easier to take care of and will require less water and pesticides. You may want to go with a ground cover other than grass, especially if you live in an area that doesn't get a lot of rain or if you just want some more variety in your lawn. [Epic Gardening](https://www.epicgardening.com/ground-cover-plants/) has a great guide to using cover plants either instead of or in addition to normal grass. 3. Cultivate a Wildflower Garden There are a few different ways to create a pollinator friendly yard. You could either add more traditional flower and/or vegetable gardens around your yard, which will require more maintenance but will be easier to get past the HOAs. Or instead of a more conventional garden, you could let the grass grow while also planting wildflowers. You might consider starting with just one section of your lawn to see how things go, and then gradually expand that section each year. (Keep in mind that it will likely take a couple of years before you get a \"pretty looking\" wildflower lawn. It's relatively easy to start cultivating a pollinator-friendly lawn. You'll need to do a quick search on what wildflowers are native to your area and then ideally seed them in early spring. [Here are more instructions on how to start and maintain your bee-friendly lawn.](https://extension.umn.edu/landscape-design/planting-and-maintaining-bee-lawn) And if you're afraid of what the neighbors might think, you can even [put up a sign](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6220&awinaffid=906223&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dpollinator%2520friendly%2520garden%2520sign%26ref%3Dauto-1%26as_prefix%3Dpollinator%2520friendly%2520garden%2520sign) to let others know what's up! 4. Find an Organic Lawn Care Company Near You If you have specific needs or problems, or if you'd rather just not do the work yourself, you'll want to hire a lawn care company that cares about non-toxic products as much as you do. Watch out for greenwashing in this area because many companies will pay lip service to safety, but without actually backing it up. Don't be afraid to ask the company questions about the products, ingredients, and methods they use. If they aren't willing to be transparent with you, consider that a yellow flag. One relatively quick way to find out if the lawn care products they use are truly non-toxic is to ask if kids and pets can be on the lawn right after application. If they say no, then whatever they're using may not be as safe as you want it to be.
