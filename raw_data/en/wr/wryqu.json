The symptoms of RSV are similar to those for the common cold, such as fever and coughing. But the virus can also cause pneumonia and other serious symptoms, especially among young children and the elderly. On Monday, an expert panel of the health ministry approved the vaccine, Arexvy, manufactured by the British pharmaceutical firm GSK. The drug is expected to prevent the onset of the RSV disease, or protect those infected from developing serious symptoms. The panel concluded that the vaccine's efficacy has been confirmed and there appear to be no major safety concerns. GSK applied for permission to manufacture and market the vaccine in Japan last October. If the ministry grants formal approval, the vaccine will be the first RSV vaccine manufactured and sold in Japan. GSK says a clinical trial involving about 25,000 people aged 60 or older from 17 countries showed that the treatment is effective. "}
