In addition to applying their [scientific expertise](https://phrma.org/Press-Release/Statement-on-Biopharmaceutical-Industry-Efforts-to-Address-the-Coronavirus-Public-Health-Emergency) to find ways to diagnose, treat and prevent infections from the virus, the biopharmaceutical industry is providing financial support and in-kind donations to organizations and collaborating with U.S. and global health authorities to combat this global public health emergency. More than half of PhRMA members have R&D efforts under way or are providing donations of medicines and critical medical supplies as well as providing financial donations to support patients and first responders in addressing this evolving crisis. Here are just a few ways America's research-based biopharmaceutical companies are working to combat the novel coronavirus: Developing potential new treatments and vaccines As part of its commitment to finding solutions for patients with coronavirus and preventing others from becoming infected, PhRMA members have been donating investigational compounds that may have potential to treat coronavirus for emergency use and clinical trials, including compounds formerly tested on other viral pathogens such as Ebola and HIV. Other members are researching vaccine candidates for prevention and undertaking inventories of existing research portfolio libraries to identify additional potential treatments for research and development. Companies are also exploring ways to leverage existing technologies that provide the ability to rapidly upscale production once a potential vaccine candidate is identified. Partnerships PhRMA member companies are collaborating with relevant U.S. and global public health authorities including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the World Health Organization (WHO), China public health authorities including the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Medicines Agency, among many others to address this public health crisis. These collaborations are focused on all areas of research and development, including evaluating how pandemic preparedness platforms can potentially be tailored to address the coronavirus emergency, leveraging existing R&D partnerships to accelerate development of antiviral agents against COVID-19 and contribute both resources and expertise to various R&D consortia to address the outbreak. Monetary and in-kind support Millions of dollars of direct monetary and in-kind contributions are being used to support organizations at the heart of the crisis who are able to have an immediate impact for infected patients and communities in China. PhRMA member companies acted immediately on the ground in China to donate a variety of crucial supplies including advanced surgical equipment, antibiotics, disinfection equipment, batch virus testing devices (e.g., throat swabs), vitamins, protective clothing, goggles, masks, gloves and more. Supply chain integrity As the situation evolves, PhRMA companies are continuing to prioritize the continuity of their supply chains and are working proactively to prevent and mitigate any potential shortages through close coordination with the FDA and other global stakeholders. Below is a snapshot of on-going PhRMA member company efforts to support the detection, prevention and treatment of the coronavirus outbreak. The below only represents a portion of the more than 50% of PhRMA's members who are engaged in this effort. AbbVie: AbbVie is collaborating with select health authorities and institutions globally on clinical research related to COVID-19. AbbVie is supporting clinical studies and basic research, working closely with European health authorities and the FDA, CDC, NIH and BARDA to coordinate on these efforts. AbbVie, Harbour BioMed (HBM), Utrecht University (UU) and Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) have [entered into a collaboration](https://news.abbvie.com/news/press-releases/abbvie-harbour-biomed-utrecht-university-and-erasmus-medical-center-announce-collaboration-to-develop-monoclonal-antibody-therapy-to-prevent-and-treat-covid-19.htm) to develop a novel antibody therapeutic to prevent and treat COVID-19. The focus of the collaboration is on advancing the fully human, neutralizing antibody 47D11 discovered by UU, EMC and HBM, which targets the conserved domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, AbbVie is donating $35 million to help support underserved communities and health care systems working to address the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. AbbVie's partners are: - [International Medical Corps ](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/)to help create capacity to treat patients at overburdened hospitals. AbbVie's donation will support the creation and operation of mobile field hospitals in the U.S. that will provide capacity and create improved patient flow options as hospitals work to keep COVID-19 patients separated from other patients. - [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/) to help meet health care system needs in the hardest hit countries. This support will enable the procurement and delivery of oxygen concentrators, ventilators and personal protective equipment to healthcare systems and prioritize countries with high infection rates. - [Feeding America ](https://www.feedingamerica.org/)to protect the most vulnerable, including the elderly, by enabling access to food and essential household supplies with minimal contact. Feeding America has created a new model of home delivery and drive-through service. Included in the $35 million is a reserve of $5 million for a new AbbVie COVID-19 Community Resilience Fund for strengthening community resilience in under-resourced areas impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, AbbVie employees with relevant scientific, health care and other critical expertise who volunteer in times of pandemic crisis will continue to receive full pay and benefits during their temporary service period. Alexion: Alexion announced plans to initiate a global Phase 3 study to investigate ULTOMIRIS\u00ae (ravulizumab-cwvz) in a subset of adults with COVID-19 - those who are hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study is expected to enroll approximately 270 patients across countries with high numbers of diagnosed cases, beginning in May, and will evaluate the impact of ULTOMIRIS, a biologic medicine, on survival, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital stay compared to best supportive care. This follows the FDA rapid review and acceptance of Alexion's investigational new drug (IND) application for ULTOMIRIS for severe COVID-19. The decision to begin this trial is based on a) published preclinical data suggesting that inhibition of terminal complement can lower cytokine and chemokine levels and significantly reduce lung inflammation and pathology in animal models of viral pneumoniai, and b) elevated complement biomarkers and promising preliminary clinical evidence from patients who have accessed SOLIRIS\u00ae (eculizumab) through our compassionate use program, which suggests that complement inhibition may improve coronaviral-mediated lung injury. Independent investigators have expressed interest in studying the potential of C5 inhibition in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and we are aware of several ongoing or planned independent studies and anecdotal results from the use of our C5 inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. While these healthcare professionals continue to aggregate data regarding the potential of terminal complement inhibition in COVID-19 pneumonia from the approximately 100 patients who have been treated so far, Alexion believes that the outcomes reported to date warrant conducting a controlled clinical program to explore the impact of C5 inhibition with ULTOMIRIS and establish clinical evidence supporting the role of terminal complement in coronaviral pneumonia. We believe ULTOMIRIS represents the future of C5 inhibition, with its weight-based dosing, reduced burden on hospital systems due to less frequent dosing and it can be manufactured at a higher capacity, providing the opportunity to better meet future supply demands.

Amgen: Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies [announced](https://wwwext.amgen.com/media/news-releases/2020/04/amgen-and-adaptive-biotechnologies-announce-strategic-partnership-to-develop-a-therapeutic-to-prevent-or-treat-covid-19/) a collaboration aimed at helping address the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies will combine expertise to discover and develop fully-human neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 to potentially prevent or treat COVID-19. The mutually exclusive collaboration brings together Adaptive's proprietary immune medicine platform for the identification of virus-neutralizing antibodies with Amgen's expertise in immunology and novel antibody therapy development. Given the rapidly rising incidence of COVID-19 around the world, the companies will begin work immediately and finalize financial details and terms in the coming weeks. Neutralizing antibodies defend healthy cells by interfering with the biological function of an invading virus. These antibodies may be used therapeutically to treat someone currently fighting the disease and can be given to people who have heightened risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as health care workers. Amgen's subsidiary, deCODE Genetics, alongside colleagues from Iceland's Directorate of Health and the National University Hospital [published online in the New England Journal of Medicine](https://wwwext.amgen.com/media/featured-news/2020/04/decode-study-in-nejm-sheds-light-on-sars-cov-2-genetics-and-true-prevalence-in-iceland/) a population-based study of the early spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (causing COVID-19 disease) in Iceland. The aim of the study was to provide as comprehensive a view as possible of how the virus spreads in a population, in this case one of 360,000 and implementing early and aggressive testing, tracking and isolation measures to contain the epidemic. The results show that roughly 0.8% of the population at large is infected with several strains or clades of the virus supporting the concern that silent carriers spread the disease. This suggests that while the efforts of the public health system have been effective so far in mitigating the spread to date, more data, including massive population screening, will be key to informing efforts to contain the virus in Iceland in the long run. This work to identify the various mutations will also be important in Amgen's collaboration with Adaptive to find antibodies that are broadly effective against different strains of SARs-CoV-2 and the various mutations those strains carry. Once the best antibody or antibodies are identified, Amgen will apply its expertise in genetics, immunology, antibody engineering, and manufacturing to optimize, develop, and produce a therapy designed to treat and prevent COVID-19 infection. Amgen is further exploring whether its medicine Otezla\u00ae (apremilast), an oral treatment approved in more than 50 countries for inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, will be investigated as a potential immunomodulatory treatment in adult patients with COVID-19 in upcoming platform trials. Otezla inhibits the activity of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme found in inflammatory cells in the human body. By inhibiting PDE4, Otezla is thought to modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, which may prove helpful in inhibiting the inflammatory response associated with the signs, symptoms and pulmonary involvements observed in some COVID-19 patients. Amgen and the Amgen Foundation have also announced an initial commitment of up to $12.5 million to support U.S. and global relief efforts to address critical needs in communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will be used to support emergency response efforts in Amgen's U.S. and international communities, patient-focused organizations that are mounting their own response efforts and international relief efforts by Direct Relief and International Medical Corps. The Amgen Foundation will also match donations made by Amgen staff around the globe who wish to contribute their own funds to the relief efforts. In addition, the Amgen Foundation seeks to advance excellence in science education and inspire the next generation of innovators: - In January, the Amgen Foundation and Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences [launched LabXchange](https://www.labxchange.org/), a free online science education platform that provides users access to personalized instruction, virtual lab experiences and networking opportunities across the global scientific community. As the founding sponsor, the Amgen Foundation awarded $11.5 million in grant funding to Harvard to deepen the impact of this new online learning platform across the globe. - The Amgen Foundation is the [founding biology partner](https://wwwext.amgen.com/media/featured-news/2020/03/khan-academy-steps-up-as-covid-19-keeps-kids-around-the-world-home-from-school/) of the Khan Academy, a leading innovative and effective educational technology platform with over 70 million registered users across the globe. - Free online learning programs supported through both of these deep relationships are available to help students continue their science education during school closures, and can be accessed via the [LabXchange](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.labxchange.org_&d=DwMFAg&c=Sexio4usKrYWFsrnxgjbcQ&r=513s3z_ZIgcpUmsH0_2ZSS5X6QxlElfzl6mxRWCNAQA&m=eg9X7Bq8Q5XJWQijGhPxY1OjtJyYBOCZW5MC8rt_dlQ&s=hOI_gv3mY9h0PzFPpeeIenAkkgTo0X2Ilzkq4XFhapw&e=) and [Khan Academy's online (Astellas) and the Astellas Global Health Foundation are each expanding support for global and local communities fighting COVID-19 by providing up to $2 million of new financial assistance, in aggregate, to meet the urgent demand for resources to help patients, health care workers and first responders. At a national level in the United States, Astellas is preparing to help humanitarian organizations working to support communities due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

GSK is taking the following actions to support the global response to COVID-19: - GSK and Sanofi are entering into a collaboration to develop an [adjuvanted vaccine for COVID-19](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/sanofi-and-gsk-to-join-forces-in-unprecedented-vaccine-collaboration-to-fight-covid-19/), using innovative technology from both companies, to help address the ongoing pandemic. Sanofi will contribute its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, which is based on recombinant DNA technology. GSK will contribute its proven pandemic adjuvant technology to the collaboration. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protect more people. - [GSK has confirmed its intention to manufacture 1 billion doses of our pandemic vaccine adjuvant system](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-announces-intention-to-produce-1-billion-doses-of-pandemic-vaccine-adjuvant/), in 2021, to support the development of multiple adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This follows completion of a review conducted across the company's global supply network. We will manufacture, fill and finish adjuvant for use in COVID-19 vaccines at sites in the UK, US, Canada and Europe. - GSK is [entering into a collaboration to find coronavirus solutions](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/gsk-and-vir-biotechnology-enter-collaboration-to-find-coronavirus-solutions/) with Vir Biotechnology. The collaboration will use Vir's proprietary monoclonal antibody platform technology to accelerate existing and identify new anti-viral antibodies that could be used as therapeutic or preventative options to help address the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks.

Sanofi will use its recombinant DNA platform to produce a 2019 novel coronavirus vaccine candidate. The recombinant technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus. The DNA sequence encoding this antigen will be combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform, the basis of Sanofi's licensed recombinant influenza product, and used to rapidly produce large quantities of the coronavirus antigen which will be formulated to stimulate the immune system to protect against the virus. The company is also collaborating with and with Translate Bio, a clinical-stage messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics company, where Sanofi is combining its deep vaccine expertise and support with Translate Bio's messenger RNA platform to discover, design, and manufacture a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. In addition, Sanofi has started a global clinical trial program with Regeneron evaluating Kevzara\u00ae (sarilumab) in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. This global clinical program began in the U.S. at medical centers in New York, one of the epicenters of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak and is quickly recruiting across the country where COVID-19 is most prevalent. Additionally, Sanofi and GSK have signed a letter of intent [to develop an adjuvanted vaccine for COVID-19](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-04-14-13-00-00), using innovative technology from both companies, to help address the ongoing pandemic. Sanofi will contribute its S-protein COVID-19 antigen, which is based on recombinant DNA technology. This technology has produced an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus, and the DNA sequence encoding this antigen has been combined into the DNA of the baculovirus expression platform, the basis of Sanofi's licensed recombinant influenza product in the US. GSK will contribute its proven pandemic adjuvant technology. The use of an adjuvant can be of particular importance in a pandemic situation since it may reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and therefore contributing to protect more people. Sanofi has [signed an agreement with Luminostics](https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/67dbf384-9199-48e1-ac18-1ddfbecf6867) to evaluate a collaboration on a unique self-testing solution for COVID-19, using Luminostics' innovative technology. Luminostics would contribute its proprietary technology for consumer-diagnostics for COVID-19 testing while Sanofi would bring its clinical research testing experience and capabilities. The goal is to provide a smartphone-based solution that eliminates the current need for healthcare professional administration or laboratory tests. Sanofi is also contributing towards those on the front lines. Sanofi China donated 1 million RMB to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation to purchase relevant equipment and supplies for the epidemic area, including protective suits, goggles, masks, gloves, and disinfection equipment. Sanofi Pasteur China donated virus testing devices (throat swabs) worth 500 thousand RMB to Hubei Provincial CDC - Center for Diseases Control and prevention. Sanofi has also contributed $450,000 to humanitarian aid organizations who are working on the frontlines and with the free health clinics across the U.S., and to community organizations helping those in need. Sunovion Pharmaceuticals: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals is committed to giving back in the communities where the Company's employees work and live around the world. As the COVID-19 situation evolved, Sunovion mobilized to contribute to community relief efforts and assist with medical supply donations to address increasing health care needs. Support has been directed to first responders, health care workers, and people and communities vulnerable to the physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19. Sunovion has provided a significant donation to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy (CDP) COVID-19 Response Fund. This fund supports nonprofit organizations responding to the pandemic among the most vulnerable populations, as well as preparedness, containment, response and recovery activities for those affected and for the responders. In partnership with MassBio, Sunovion contributed to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) to bring donated medical supplies and resources to the State's health care institutions so that they can continue to test and treat patients with COVID-19. The Company donated cases of PPE including respirators, masks, safety goggles and gloves, as well as protective suits, gowns and shoe covers. In New Jersey, Sunovion donated safety masks to the Office of Emergency Management for distribution to the health care system. In Canada, Sunovion has joined forces with Innovative Medicines Canada to set up a COVID-19 fund to support the most urgent needs and communities across the country, beginning with a shipment of safety masks for front-line health care providers. Additionally, following a call from the government, a number of Sunovion's UK team members are serving as volunteers to support the community and the National Health Service (NHS). In the U.S., Sunovion has partnered with its food service vendor to provide food donations to the United Way of Tri-County and has provided financial support to the Greater Boston Food Bank and Community Foodbank of New Jersey, which have a key role in distributing food and grocery products to member agencies that serve people experiencing food insecurity throughout their respective communities. In the UK, Sunovion has delivered food donations to a food bank in London. Takeda: Takeda and CSL Behring have formed an alliance along with other global plasma leaders to develop a potential plasma-derived therapy for treating COVID-19. The alliance will begin immediately with the investigational development of one, unbranded anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin medicine with the potential to treat individuals with serious complications from COVID-19. The collaboration will leverage leading-edge expertise and work that the companies already have underway. Experts from the alliance will begin collaborating across key aspects such as plasma collections, clinical trial development and manufacturing. Further companies and institutions may join the alliance as well. Developing a hyperimmune will require plasma donation from many individuals who have fully recovered from COVID-19, and whose blood contains antibodies that can fight the novel coronavirus. Once collected, the \"convalescent\" plasma would then be transported to manufacturing facilities where it undergoes proprietary processing, including effective virus inactivation and removal processes, and then is purified into the product. Takeda is also donating more than [$6.25 million dollars](https://www.takeda.com/en-us/newsroom/news-releases/2020/supporting-our-communities-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/) to organizations in the United States to help those impacted by the Coronavirus and to help enable organizations to continue helping the communities they serve. Teva Pharmaceutical: Teva is donating critical medicines, which are being studied in clinical trials to assess benefit against COVID-19 globally, including more than 10 million doses of [hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets through wholesalers to hospitals across the U.S.](https://www.tevausa.com/news-and-media/press-releases/teva-to-donate-potential-covid-19-treatment-hydroxychloroquine-sulfate-tablets-to-hospitals-nationwide-/) This includes tablets being used in critical research efforts. TEVA's global manufacturing network continues to increase production of both active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and finished product to ensure these medicines will get to patients globally, wherever and whenever they are needed.
