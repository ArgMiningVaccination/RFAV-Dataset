First, the IRS requested an amendment to define the term \"leased employee,\" which appears in the definition of \"Eligible Employee\" in section 1.8. The amendment defines the term \"leased employee\" according to tax laws. Second, the IRS also requested an amendment to clarify the ORP's definition of \"compensation\" for purposes of tax laws that limit contributions to the Plan to a maxi mum of 100% of a participant's \"compensation\" per year. The amendment defines \"compensation\" for this purpose as wages subject to income tax withholding (plus some elective deferrals that laws exclude from wages for tax withholding). This definition is one of several optional definitions of \"compensation\" permitted by applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. IMPACT The first amendment will not affect ORP operations because it is merely a clarification of an existing ORP provision. Likewise, the second amendment will not affect ORP operations because (i) the ORP provides for contributions at a rate well below 100% of a participant's compensation ; and ( ii) the ORP's definition of \"compensation\" for purposes other than this tax law limit will remain unchanged. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Amendments to Optional Retirement Plan document Page 3 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Board tax counsel prepared amendments to the ORP consistent with the IRS request. The amendments were submitted by Board tax counsel to the IRS CONSENT AGENDA AUGUST 14, 2014 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION I TAB 1 Page 2 earlier this summer subject to approval by the Board. Board counsel and staff received a letter dated July 1, 2104 from the IRS with notification of initial approval of the ORP determination letter application. Staff recommends approval.

Moved by____________ Seconded by_____________ Carried Yes____ No____ ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION I TAB 1 Page 3 AMENDMENTS TO IDAHO STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION OPTIONAL RETIREMENT PLAN IN RESPONSE TO IRS DETERMINATION LETTER REVIEW 1. Amend Plan section 1.8 as follows, effective January 1, 2008: Replace the sentence \"The term Eligible Employee shall not include any leased employee deemed to be an employee of the Institution as provided in Code section 414(n)\" with the following: The term Eligible Employee shall not include a \"leased employee\" as defined in Code section 414(n), which defines a \"leased employee\" as any person (other than an employee of the recipient) who pursuant to an agreement between the recipient and any other person (\"leasing organization\") has performed services for the recipient (or for the recipient and related persons determined in accordance with Code section 414(n)(6)) on a substantially full time basis for a period of at least one year, and such services are performed under primary direction or control by the recipient. 2. Add the following to the end of Plan section 4.8, effective January 1, 2008: (b) Solely for purposes of applying Code section 415 limits, compensation is defined as wages within the meaning of Code section 3401(a), plus amounts that would be included in wages but for an election under Code section 125(a), 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k) or 457(b), all as described in Treas.

Dr. Petersen served in the United States Navy and Navy Reserve for 17 years, earning his doctorate in operations and sourcing management in 1999 from Michigan State University. He has held faculty positions at University of Oregon, Arizona State University, Colorado State University and University of Tennessee, where he served as the John H. \"Red\" Dove Professor of Supply Chain Management. IMPACT Participation in the 403(b) Supplemental Retirement Plan is an important recruitment and retention tool for the University. Dr. Petersen contributed to a supplemental retirement plan with his former employer; he would like to continue that practice at Boise State University. Dr. Peterse n's contribution rates will mirror Dr. Kustra and Mark Coyle's contribution rates for the balance of 2014; thereafter, in accordance with plan amendments approved by the Board in February 2014, all participant contribution rates will adjust to 3.5 percent for employer contributions and 2.5 percent employee contributions.

There are no deans or other administrators participating in the plan at this time. Offering this benefit is really a business decision for the institution in terms of how much they are willing to pay in the form of deferred compensation in support of recruitment and retention efforts. Staff recommends approval.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The servers that currently run on the core software of Idaho State University's (ISU) Banner Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system were purchased in the spring of 2007. They have served the University well over the past seven years, but are near the end of their useful life. After extensive analysis of many options for a new hardware platform for these core University services, the University proposes to purchase equipment to replace these servers. The servers and associated network and storage equipment represent the current state of the art for modern enterprise operations. The proposed solution also enhances the business continuity/disaster recovery plans of the University by dividing the servers between two existing computer operations centers on campus. All purchases will be made in conformance with state purchasing policies and procedures. Most purchases will be made from vendors on existing state contracts. IMPACT The total estimated cost for the purchase of these servers and associated system software licenses, including three years of maintenance, is $1,418,244, funded by appropriated funds.

This equipment is used by AT&T to provide its customers with wireless personal communication service in the surrounding area. The original agreement provided for an annual payment of $9,600 to UI and the agreement could be terminated by either party by at least one year's prior notice. The site has been periodically updated to install newer technology for personal phone and data use. The existing license did not provide for escalations in the use fee. The University has proposed and AT&T has tentatively agreed to revise the terms of this agreement primarily to increase the annual fee paid to $24,000/yr. T he proposed agreement also provides AT&T with permission to use the building rooftop for five years with the ability for AT&T to extend for two additional five year periods. These renewal periods provide fee increases of 15% to UI for each of the two extensions. IMPACT The University will receive a substantial increase in payment to extend the license agreement and the installations do not interfere with University operations in this student residential building .

All Equipment shall remain Grantee's personal property and are not fixtures (except any prior or future improvements to the building 's electrical system performed by Grantee and such improvements shall ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 5 remain and become the property of Grantor upon installation). Grantee shall have the right to remove all Equipment at its sole expense on or before the expiration of this Agreement or its earlier termination; provided, Grantee restores the Premises and the routes used for access to the Premises to the condition that existed at the Commencement Date, reasonable wear and tear excepted. b. Electricity shall be provided by Grantor. Unless failure or interruption of utility service is caused by the intentional act or omission of Grantor, Grantor shall not be liable in damages or otherwise for any failure or interruption of any utility service being furnished to the Site . No such failure or interruption, whether resulting from a casualty or otherwise, shall entitle Grantee to terminate this Agreement or to abate the Use Fee Grantee is required to make under this Agreement, unless such failure or interruption is caused by the intentional act or omission of Grantor.

Grantee ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 6 will resolve any technical interference problems with other equipment or services located at or near the Site, whether installed as of the Commencement Date or at a later date during the Term of this Agreement. In the event that a technical interference problem arises, Grantee will work with Grantor to resolve the problem immediately in a mutually satisfactory manner. However, if a mutually satisfactory resolution cannot be agreed upon, the Grantor may, in its sole judgment, make the final determination of the manner in which the problem shall be resolved. h.

This Agreement may be terminated without further liability on thirty (30) days prior written notice by either party upon a default of any covenant or term hereof by the other party, which default is not cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice of default, however if the nature of the default is such that it cannot be cured within thirty (30) days then no default will be deemed to exist so long as the defaulting party commences to cure the default within the thirty (30) day period and diligently prosecutes the same with reasonable diligence, provided that the grace period for any monetary default is thirty (30) days from receipt of written notice; or by Grantee for any or no reason, provided Grantee delivers written notice of early termination to Grantor. b. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Grantee, at its own expense, shall remove the Grantee Facilities and restore the Site to the condition that existed prior to Grantee's installation of Equipment , reasonable wear and tear excepted. In the event Grantee ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 7 terminates this Agreement early for reasons other than default by Grantor, Grantee shall not be reimbursed for previously paid Use Fee, but such termination shall terminate all future Grantee obligations regarding subsequent years' Use Fee. 9. Destruction or Condemnation. If Grantee chooses not to terminate this Agreement upon destruction or condemnation, the Use Fee shall be reduced or abated in proportion to the actual reduction or abatement of use of the Site until such time as the damage is repaired or Site replaced. 10. Indemnity. Grantee and Grantee's agents and subcontractors shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and save Grantor, its successors, assigns, and agents harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, or expenses which Grantor may incur as a result of any act or omission of the Grantee, Grantee's agents, contractors, and subcontractors in their use of the Site under this Agreement or any other action in relation to this Agreement. If any action, claim or demand is made against Grantor for any act or omission of the Grantee, its agents, contractors and subcontractors, the Grantee agrees to assume the expense and shall pay all costs, charges, attorneys' fees, settlements, judgments or other expenses incurred by or obtained against Grantor, and also, including all attorneys' fees and costs associated with any appeal proceeding. This indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement for claims, liabilities, losses, costs, charges, or expenses occurring after termination but attributable to the uses authorized by this Agreement. Subject to the limits of liability specified in Idaho Code 6-901 through 6-929, known as the Idaho Tort Claims Act , Grantor shall hold Grantee, its agents and assigns, harmless from and/or against claims, damages, and liabilities (including reasonable attorney's fees) that may be suffered or incurred and that arise as a direct result of and which are caused by the University's performance under this Agreement. This does not apply when such claims, damages, and liabilities are the result of negligent acts, errors, omissions or fault on the part of Grantee, its agents or assigns \u2014including conditions of Grantor's premises, or when the claim or suit is made against Grantee by the University, the State of Idaho, or any of its agencies. Except for claims arising from its own acts of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, Grantor will not have any liability for personal injury or death, loss of revenue due to discontinuance of operations at the Site, or imperfect communications operations experienced by Grantee for any reason. The obligations pursuant to this Section 10 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Grantee shall promptly notify the University of Idaho, Attn: Risk Management Officer, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 3162, Moscow ID 83844-3162, of any such claim of which it has knowledge and shall cooperate fully with Grantor or its representatives in the defense of the same. Grantor's liability coverage is provided through a self-funded liability program. Limits of liability are $500,000 Combined Single Limits, which amount is the Grantor's limit of liability under the Idaho Tort Claims Act. 11. Insurance. Grantee and Grantee's contr actors and subcontractors are required to carry the types and limits of insurance shown in this Section 11, and provide Grantor with a Certificate of Insurance executed by a duly authorized representative of each insurer, showing compliance with these insu rance requirements. Certificates from Grantee and Grantee's contractor and subcontractors shall be provided (7) seven days prior to Grantee's use of Grantor's property. All insurers shall have a Best's rating of \"A minus V\" or better and be eligible to do business in Idaho. All policies required shall be written as primary policies and not contributing to nor in excess of any coverage Grantor may choose to maintain. All required liability policies shall ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 8 include State of Idaho and the Regents of the University of Idaho as an additional insured. Grant or's additional insured status shall (i) be limited to bodily injury, property damage or personal and advertising injury caused, in whole or in part, by Grantee, its employees, agents or independent contractors; (ii) not extend to claims for punitive or exemplary damages arising out of the acts or omissions of Grantor, its employees, agents or independent contractors or where such coverage is prohibited by law or to claims arising out of the gross negligence of Grantor, its employees, agents or independent contractors; and, (iii) not exceed Grant ee's indemnification obligation under this Agreement, if any. Certificates shall be mailed to: 875 Perimeter Dr MS 3162, Moscow ID 83844-3162, Attn: Risk Management. All required policies shall contain waiver of subrogation coverage or endorsements. Failure of Grantor to demand such certificate or other evidence of full compliance with these insurance requirements or failure of Grantor to identify a deficiency from evidence that is provided shall not be construed as a waiver of Grantee's obligation to maintain such insurance. Failure to maintain the required insurance may result in termination of this Agreement at Grantor 's option. By requiring insurance herein, Grantor does not represent that coverage and limits will necessarily be adequate to protect Grantee and such coverage and limits shall not be deemed as a limitation on Grantee's liability under the indemnities gra nted to Grantor in this License. Grantee shall at its sole cost and expense, procure and maintain insurance of the types and in the amounts described below: a. Commercial General and or Umbrella excess Liability Insurance: Grantee and Grantee's contractors and subcontractors while working hereunder shall maintain commercial general liability (CGL) and, if necessary, commercial umbrella insurance with a limit of not less than $1,000,000 each occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate. CGL insurance shall be written on standard ISO occurrence form (or a substitute form providing equivalent coverage) and shall cover liability arising from premises, operations, independent contractors, products-completed operations, personal injury and advertising injury, sudden and accidental pollution for third parties, and contractual liability coverage. b. Commercial Auto Insurance: Grantee and Grantee's agents, contractors and subcontractors while working hereunder shall maintain a Commercial Auto policy with a Combined Single Limit of $1,000,000;. Coverage shall include Non-Owned and Hired Car coverage. c. Personal property: In no event shall Grantor be liable for any damage to or loss of personal property sustained by Grantee or Grantee's agents or contractors, whether or not insured, even if such loss is caused by the negligence of Grantor, its employees, officers or agents. d. Workers' Compensation: Where required by law, Grantee and Grantee's agents, contractors and subcontractors shall maintain all statutorily required coverages including Employer's Liability. Grantee is responsible for collecting Certificates of Insurance evidencing Workers Compensation coverage from Grantee's agents and subcontractors, and for forwarding such Certificates to Grantor. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Grantee may, in its sole discretion, self insure any of the required insurance under the same terms as required by this Agreement.

The 2014 Session called for reviewing curricular materials in the main subject area of Professional- Techn ical Education and interim materials in 6- 12 English Language Arts/Literacy. Annual materials include Computer Applications and Limited English Proficiency. Several of these materials have accompanying electronic instructional media. Others are deliverable via CD-ROM or the Internet. The Curricular Materials Selection Committee considers their work an important contribution to the educational process in Idaho. This Committee reflects the diversity of Idaho's population both geographically and philosophically. Occasionally the approval of a certain material is not a unanimous decision by the Committee. CONSENT AUGUST 14, 2014 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 4 CURRICULAR MATERIALS ADOPTION PROCEDURES FOR THE STATE OF IDAHO The Curricular Materials adoption process has its basis in Idaho Code (33-118, 333- 118A). It is further defined in the Administrative Rules of the State Board of Education (SBOE), IDAPA 08.02.03, subsection 128. The Adoption Process in Idaho provides for the continuous review and evaluation of new curricular materials. This process ensures that Idaho schools have quality products available to purchase at a guaranteed low price, and equal availability to all Idaho school districts. This process maintains local control in the choice of instruction materials by providing multiple lists of approved materials. The adoption process also provides, th rough a contract with each publisher, a contract price that is good for th e length of the adoption cycle. This ensures quality for each school district and allows for the best materials at the lowest possible price for Idaho's schools. It is recommended that districts choose materials from the list of vetted and approved materials. School districts are not required to choose materials from this list. Idaho adopts materials in the areas of reading, research based reading, literature, drivers education, science, health, handwriting, mathematics, business education, career education, counseling, social studies, English, applied English, spelling, dictionary, thesaurus, speech, journalism, world, languages, art, drama, music, healthy life styles, professional technical education, business computer applications (adopted annually), and limited English proficiency (adopted annually). Materials are adopted in Idaho on a six-year rotating schedule. Publishers have an additional one-year following the main adoption year to submit new copyrights for a particular content area, allowing each of the content area submissions a total of two years. The intent of the adoption process is to generally approve all materials meeting the established criteria and to reject those items that are considered unsuitable for use in their designated subject area. CONSENT AUGUST 14, 2014 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 5 Curricular Materials Adoption Procedures Curricular materials in Idaho are defined as textbooks and instructional media including software, audio/visual media and Internet resources (Idaho Code 33-118A). Idaho is a multiple adoption state and adopts a number of materials in a designated subject area from a variety of publishing companies. This is consistent with the belief that a variety of materials has value and usefulness to the schools. The Curricular Materials Selection Committee , which is appointed by the SBOE, has the responsibility of overseeing the adoption process for the state. The Executive Secretary to this Committee is an employee of the State Department of Education (SDE). The membership on the Selection Committee consists of representatives from the following areas: the state's four colleges of educ ation secondary administrator elementary administrator secondary teachers elementary teachers district school board member representative from private/parochial schools parent representatives member who is not a public school educator nor trustee content area specialist from the SDE representative from the Division of Professional-Technical Education the Executive Secretary CONSENT AUGUST 14, 2014 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 6 Curricular Materials Adoption Procedures All members are appointed by the SBOE for a five-year term with the exception of the SDE content coordinator and the representative from Professional-Technical Education who serve for one year. Current Committee members are listed in this publication. The Committee, assisted by Professional-Technical Education, English Language Arts, Limited English Proficiency, and Computer Application specialists from throughout the state, met for five days in June to review and correlate all materials to the Common Core State Standards and/or the Idaho Content Standards and specific course requirements. This meeting followed a one month remote review process. The Committee votes on the materials and those recommended are forwarded to the SBOE for official adoption for Idaho Schools. All meetings of the Committee are open to the public. Following formal adoption (August 2014), contracts are mailed to the publishing companies (August 2014). After the return of signed contracts, the listing of newly adopted materials is published by December 3, 2014 in the annual Adoption Guide found on the Internet at: Hhttp://www.sde.idaho.gov/site/curricular_materials/adoption_guide.htm U A state curriculum library is maintained at Caxton Printers as required by Idaho Code 118A. Adopted materials are housed in this library and available to the public. In addition, seven (7) Regional Centers maintain libraries of adopted materials that are available to the public as well as college students and local schools. The Regional Centers are located as follows: N.L. Terteling Library College of Idaho Caldwell, Idaho Albertson Library Boise State University Boise, Idaho David O. McKay Library Brigham Young University-Idaho Rexburg, Idaho Instructional Materials Center Idaho State University Pocatello, Idaho Curriculum Library Lewis -Clark State College Lewiston, Idaho Riley Library Northwest Nazarene University Nampa, Idaho Instructional Materials Technology Ctr University of Idaho Moscow, Idaho Citizens of Idaho may request the Committee to reconsider any material under adoption. A form titled Textbook Adoption Process: Request for Reconsideration of Materials is available from the SDE. The Committee considers all requests and maintains the right to either recommend continued adoption or removal of materials from the adopted list.

Rich, engaging, and complex texts are t he program's anchor \u2014challenging and supporting all students to become critical and close readers. The program fosters success in writing across varied genres through models of effective writing and provides ample opportunities for speaking and writing abou t texts. Collections offers complex and rigorous texts, in a print, digital, or blended approach, that reflect the CCSS grade -level bands and represents the spiraling ladder of text complexity among grades 6 -12. Text selections in the primary component of Collections , the Student Edition , are based on the comprehensive text complexity bands and include Lexile scores, qualitative aspects, and reader and task expectations, as well as appeal for students. The secondary component, the Close Reader , focus studen ts on specific topics for text -based study, with related selections included in the program. Text complexity rubrics for each selection in the program are included in the Teacher's Edition so that teachers can clearly identify the complexity characteristi cs ascribed to a particular selection in either the Student Edition or the Close Reader. By incorporating varied genres of texts and extended texts, as prescribed by Common Core State Standard 10 for ELA, the program ensures that students have the experien ces with a wide variety of texts needed to learn analysis skills for independent reading and comprehension of challenging texts. The rich variety of texts adds real -world application and relevance to the readings. A full page of instruction follows each s election in the Student Edition . This information addresses the CCSS focus and asks students to re -enter the text multiple times, citing specific textual evidence to support their analysis. Students are then asked a comprehensive set of higher order thinki ng skills questions that focus on textual analysis and require specific textual evidence in the responses. These Analyzing the Text questions are answered in their Student eEdition and are available for teacher review. Close Read Screencasts provide an audio and visual model of an analytical conversation about the text. These conversations focus entirely on the text itself, providing a rich and supportive scaffold for each anchor text and also providing a model of how students can converse wi th others or analyze a text independently. Differentiated guidance and support is available for students with developmental differences and learning styles. The goal for Collections is that each and every student has access to complex texts as required by CCSS. Collections features ongoing assessment and performance tasks that allow for teachers to monitor students' progress and content mastery. Prescriptive remediation and re -teaching lessons are provided for students who struggle with mastery through the online assessment and re -teaching options. Students will be automatically assigned to Interactive Level Up tutorials, GrammarNotes instruction, WordSharp , and re-teaching worksheets, depending on their need for instruction.

SDE TAB 10 Page 87 The Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Collections program is a Grades 6 -12 literature textbook series that is a comprehensive resource for addressing all expectations of the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts. Rich, engaging, and complex texts are the program's anchor \u2014challenging and supporting all students to become critical and close readers. The program fosters success in writing across varied genres through models of effective writing and provides ample opportunities for speaking and w riting about texts. Collections offers complex and rigorous texts, in a print, digital, or blended approach, that reflect the CCSS grade -level bands and represents the spiraling ladder of text complexity among grades 6 -12. Text selections in the primary component of Collections , the Student Edition , are based on the comprehensive text complexity bands and include Lexile scores, qualitative aspects, and reader and task expectations, as well as appeal for students. The secondary component, the Close Reader , focus students on specific topic s for text -based study, with related selections included in the program. Text complexity rubrics for each selection in the program are included in the Teacher's Edition so that teachers can clearly identify the complexity characteristics ascribed to a par ticular selection in either the Student Edition or the Close Reader. By incorporating varied genres of texts and extended texts, as prescribed by Common Core State Standard 10 for ELA, the program ensures that students have the experiences with a wide vari ety of texts needed to learn analysis skills for independent reading and comprehension of challenging texts. The rich variety of texts adds real -world application and relevance to the readings. A full page of instruction follows each selection in the Stud ent Edition . This information addresses the CCSS focus and asks students to re -enter the text multiple times, citing specific textual evidence to support their analysis. Students are then asked a comprehensive set of higher order thinking skills questions that focus on textual analysis and require specific textual evidence in the responses. These Analyzing the Text questions are answered in their Student eEdition and are available for teacher review. Close Read Screencasts provide an audio and visual model of an analytical conversation about the text. These conversations focus entirely on the text itself, providing a rich and supportive scaffold for each anchor text and also providing a model of how students can converse with others or analyze a text indepen dently. Differentiated guidance and support is available for students with developmental differences and learning styles. The goal for Collections is that each and every student has access to complex texts as required by CCSS. Collections features ongoing assessment and performance tasks that allow for teachers to monitor students' progress and content mastery. Prescriptive remediation and re -teaching lessons are provided for students who struggle with mastery through the online assessment and re -teaching options. Students will be automatically assigned to Interactive Level Up tutorials, GrammarNotes instruction, WordSharp , and re-teaching worksheets, depending on their need for instruction. Teacher reporting is explicit and allows for indiv idual learning prescriptions. In the Teacher's Edition , additional differentiation notes regarding scaffolding instruction for complex texts for Struggling Learners (Reteach), Advanced Learners (Enrich), and English Learners are included so that each stude nt will have successful encounters with the complex texts in the program. The convenience for teachers is that the scaffolding suggestions for all selections in both the Student Edition and Close Reader are included and integrated at point -of-use in the al l-in-one Teacher's Edition.

SDE TAB 10 Page 97 The Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Collections program is a Grades 6 -12 literature textbook series that is a comprehensive resource for addressing all expectations of the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts. Rich, engaging, and complex texts are the program's anchor \u2014challenging and supporting all students to become critical and close readers. The program fosters success in writing across varied genres through models of effective writing and prov ides ample opportunities for speaking and writing about texts. Collections offers complex and rigorous texts, in a print, digital, or blended approach, that reflect the CCSS grade -level bands and represents the spiraling ladder of text complexity among grades 6 -12. Text selections in the primary component of Collections , the Student Edition , are based on the comprehensive text complexity bands and include Lexile scores, qualitative aspects, and reader and task expectations, as well as appeal for students. The secondary component, the Close Reader , focus students on specific topic s for text -based study, with related selections included in the program. Text complexity rubrics for each selection in the program are included in the Teacher's Edition so that teachers can clearly identify the complexity characteristics ascribed to a par ticular selection in either the Student Edition or the Close Reader. By incorporating varied genres of texts and extended texts, as prescribed by Common Core State Standard 10 for ELA, the program ensures that students have the experiences with a wide vari ety of texts needed to learn analysis skills for independent reading and comprehension of challenging texts. The rich variety of texts adds real -world application and relevance to the readings. A full page of instruction follows each selection in the Stud ent Edition . This information addresses the CCSS focus and asks students to re -enter the text multiple times, citing specific textual evidence to support their analysis. Students are then asked a comprehensive set of higher order thinking skills questions that focus on textual analysis and require specific textual evidence in the responses. These Analyzing the Text questions are answered in their Student eEdition and are available for teacher review. Close Read Screencasts provide an audio and visual model of an analytical conversation about the text. These conversations focus entirely on the text itself, providing a rich and supportive scaffold for each anchor text and also providing a model of how students can converse with others or analyze a text indepen dently. Differentiated guidance and support is available for students with developmental differences and learning styles. The goal for Collections is that each and every student has access to complex texts as required by CCSS. Collections features ongoing assessment and performance tasks that allow for teachers to monitor students' progress and content mastery. Prescriptive remediation and re -teaching lessons are provided for students who struggle with mastery through the online assessment and re -teaching options. Students will be automatically assigned to Interactive Level Up tutorials, GrammarNotes instruction, WordSharp , and re-teaching worksheets, depending on their need for instruction. Teacher reporting is explicit and allows for indiv idual learning prescriptions. In the Teacher's Edition , additional differentiation notes regarding scaffolding instruction for complex texts for Struggling Learners (Reteach), Advanced Learners (Enrich), and English Learners are included so that each stude nt will have successful encounters with the complex texts in the program. The convenience for teachers is that the scaffolding suggestions for all selections in both the Student Edition and Close Reader are included and integrated at point -of-use in the al l-in-one Teacher's Edition. Students are engaged in a variety of digital activities that include different modalities of learning to better reach the ful l range of readers. The Digital Collections for writing, speaking, and listening include engaging and i nteractive lessons with drag -and-drop features and game -like completion tools. Each is completed at the student's own pace and provides immediate feedback on learning. Students are engaged in the analysis of complex text, writing, and using the speaking, listening, and writing Digital Collections for comprehensive standards coverage. The Integrated Student eBook offers a zoom feature that allows low -vision students to have access to text. Students can access their notes, annotations, and text markings stor ed in myNotebook to complete Performance Tasks.

SDE TAB 10 Page 118 The Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Collections program is a Grades 6 -12 literature textbook series that is a comprehensive resource for addressing all expectations of the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts. Rich, engaging, and complex texts are the program's anchor \u2014challenging and supporting all students to become critical and close readers. Th e program fosters success in writing across varied genres through models of effective writing and provides ample opportunities for speaking and writing about texts. Collections offers complex and rigorous texts, in a print, digital, or blended approach, that reflect the CCSS grade -level bands and represents the spiraling ladder of text complexity among grades 6 -12. Text selections in the primary component of Collections , the Student Edition , are based on the comprehensive text complexity bands and include Lexile scores, qualitative aspects, and reader and task expectations, as well as appeal for students. The secondary component, the Close Reader , focus students on specific topic s for text -based study, with related selections included in the program. Text complexity rubrics for each selection in the program are included in the Teacher's Edition so that teachers can clearly identify the complexity characteristics ascribed to a par ticular selection in either the Student Edition or the Close Reader. By incorporating varied genres of texts and extended texts, as prescribed by Common Core State Standard 10 for ELA, the program ensures that students have the experiences with a wide vari ety of texts needed to learn analysis skills for independent reading and comprehension of challenging texts. The rich variety of texts adds real -world application and relevance to the readings. A full page of instruction follows each selection in the Stud ent Edition . This information addresses the CCSS focus and asks students to re -enter the text multiple times, citing specific textual evidence to support their analysis. Students are then asked a comprehensive set of higher order thinking skills questions that focus on textual analysis and require specific textual evidence in the responses. These Analyzing the Text questions are answered in their Student eEdition and are available for teacher review. Close Read Screencasts provide an audio and visual model of an analytical conversation about the text. These conversations focus entirely on the text itself, providing a rich and supportive scaffold for each anchor text and also providing a model of how students can converse wi th others or analyze a text independently. Differentiated guidance and support is available for students with developmental differences and learning styles. The goal for Collections is that each and every student has access to complex texts as required by CCSS. Collections features ongoing assessment and performance tasks that allow for teachers to monitor students' progress and content mastery. Prescriptive remediation and re -teaching lessons are provided for students who struggle with mastery through the online assessment and re -teaching options. Students will be automatically assigned to Interactive Level Up tutorials, GrammarNotes instruction, WordSharp , and re-teaching worksheets, depending on their need for instruction. Teacher reporting is explicit an d allows for individual learning prescriptions. In the Teacher's Edition , additional differentiation notes regarding scaffolding instruction for complex texts for Struggling Learners (Reteach), Advanced Learners (Enrich), and English Learners are included so that each student will have successful encounters with the complex texts in the program. The convenience for teachers is that the scaffolding suggestions for all selections in both the Student Edition and Close Reader are included and integrated at poin t-of-use in the all -in-one Teacher's Edition. Students are engaged in a variety of digital activities that include different modalities of learning to better reach the ful l range of readers. The Digital Collections for writing, speaking, and listening incl ude engaging and interactive lessons with drag -and-drop features and game -like completion tools. Each is completed at the student's own pace and provides immediate feedback on learning. Students are engaged in the analysis of complex text, writing, and usi ng the speaking, listening, and writing Digital Collections for comprehensive standards coverage. The Integrated Student eBook offers a zoom feature that allows low -vision students to have access to text. Students can access their notes, annotations, and text markings stored in myNotebook to complete Performance Tasks. Using the collaborative writing tool myWriteSmart , students may then draft and revise their responses, getting feedback from both their teac her and peers as they complete the project. The finished written products are stored in each student's digital Portfolio .

The review was conducted by an eight-member state program approval team accompanied by two state observers. The standards used to validate the Institutional Report were the State Board of Education - approved Idaho Standards for the Initial Certification of Professional School Personnel. State Board -approved knowledge and performance indicators , as well as rubrics, were used to assist team members in determining how well standards are being met. Core standards, as well as individual program enhancement standards, were reviewed. Only foundational and enhancement standards are subject to approval. Core standards are not subject to approval, since they permeate all programs but are not in themselves a program. Team members looked for a minimum of three applicable pieces of evidence to validate each standard, including but not limited to: course syllabi, minutes of relevant scheduled meetings, candidate evaluations and letters of support, additional evaluations both formal and informal, blog posts and comments, advising checklists, class assignments and reports, Praxis II test results, as well as partial and completed education Teacher Performance Assessments (edTPA). In addition to this documentation, team members conducted interviews with candidates, completers, university administrators, university faculty, PreK-12 principals and cooperating teachers. A written state team report was submitted to the unit, which has the opportunity to submit a rejoinder regarding any factual item in the report or identify any area that might have been overlooked by the team. No rejoinder was submitted. During its March 6, 2014 meeting, t he Professional Standards Commission (PSC) voted to approve the state team report and recommends to the State Board approval of the following programs: Elementary Education, English Language Arts, Reading (Literacy), Physical Education, Health Education, CONSENT AGENDA AUGUST 14 , 2014 CONSENT - SDE TAB 11 Page 2 Mathematics , Social Studies (Foundation Standards ), History , Science (Foundation Standards) , and Gifted and Talented . Five programs are recommended for conditional approval. The Special Education program was not able to show that it was meeting all of the performance standards. The Biology, Chemistry, and Earth and Space Science programs showed evidence that they were positioned to offer viable programs, but there was not enough performance evidence in the foundation standards to show proof of implementation. Their Bilingual and English as a New Language program does not have any completers yet, so there was minimal evidence to review. The conditionally approved programs will undergo focused visits within three years to determine if the conditions have been met and if the program is eligible for approval. IMPACT In order to maintain their state approved status, and produce graduates eligible for Idaho teacher certification, Lewis-Clark State College must offer a teacher preparation p rogram adequately aligned to both NCATE and State Standards.

Established by an act of the Id aho State Legislature in 1893, the college was originally designated the Lewiston Normal Sc hool, reflecting its early mission as a teacher training facility. In 1963, the legi slature granted the then Lewis- Clark Normal School its current status as a four-year undergradu ate institution. Its present name , Lewis-Clark State College, was authorized by the Legislature and governing board in 1971, making the college the last public normal school in the United States. The purpose of the on-site review was to de termine if sufficient evidence was presented indicating that candidates at Lewis-Clark State University meet state standards for beginning teachers. The review was conducted by a se ven member state program approval team accompanied by two state observers. The standards used to validate the Institutional Report were the State Board of Education-approved Ida ho Standards for the Initi al Certification of Professional School Personnel. State Board-approved knowledge and performance indicators, as well as rubrics, were used to assist team me mbers in determining how well standards are being met. Core standards as well as individual program foundational and enhancement standards were reviewed. Core standards are not subject to approval, since they permeate all programs, but are not in themselves, a program. Team members looked for a minimum of three a pplicable pieces of evidence to validate each standard. These evidences included but were no t limited to: course syllabi, class assignment descriptions, assignment grading rubrics, candidate evaluations and letters of support, additional evaluations, both formal and informal, program course requirement lists, actual class assignments, Praxis II test resu lts, and electronic portfo lio entry evidence. Some observations of candidates teaching through PreK-12 site visits and video presenta tions were also used. In addition to this documentation, team members conduc ted interviews with ca ndidates, completers, college administrators, college faculty, Pr eK-12 principals, and cooperating teachers. To assist the reader, the repor t includes language recommende d by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Educa tion, a national accrediting agenc y. Specifically, to assist the reader, the terms below are used throughout the report as defined below: Candidate - a student enrolled at th e Lewis-Clark State College. Student - an individual enrolled in an Idaho PreK-12 public school Unit - the institution's teacher preparation program NCATE - National Council for the Accred itation of Teacher Education In addition two other notations may be found in the report that are uniqu e to Lewis-Clark State College and therefore need to be defined: OSTE - On site teacher evaluator, or OSTE, is the unit name utilized for what is more commonly known as a cooperating teacher. PACE Program - This is the unit acronym utilized for its on-line and partial on-line degree options. Evidence was evaluated from both trad itional candidates as well as PACE program candidates to ensure that standa rds were being met, no matter wh ich option the candidate chose.

As such, the standards set the criteria by which teacher preparation programs are reviewed for state program approval. The following rubric is used to evaluate the extent to which teacher preparation programs prepare teachers who meet the standards. The rubric is designed to be used with each individual preparation program (i.e., Elementary, Speci al Education, Secondary English, Secondary Science-Biology, etc.). Consistent with NCATE accreditation standards, the rubrics describe three levels of performance (i.e., unacceptable, acceptable, a nd target) for each of the Idaho Standards for Initial Certification. The rubric shall be used to make holistic judgments. Elements identified in the rubrics provide the basis upon which the State Program Approval Team evaluates the institution's evidence that candidates meet the Id aho standards. The inst itution is expected to provide information about candidate performance related to the Idaho Core Teacher Standards (and Idaho Teacher Standards fo r specific preparation areas). Standard 1: Knowledge of Subject Matter - The teacher understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline taught and creates learning experiences that make these aspects of subject matter meaningful for students.

The following rubric is used to evaluate the extent to which teacher preparation programs prepare teachers who meet the standards. The rubric is designed to be used with each individual preparation program (i.e., Elementary, Speci al Education, Secondary English, Secondary Science-Biology, etc.). Consistent with NCATE accreditation standards, the rubrics describe three levels of performance (i.e., unacceptable, acceptable, a nd target) for each of the Idaho Standards for Initial Certification. The rubric shall be used to make holistic judgments, rather than as an element-by- element checklist. Elements identified in th e rubrics provide the ba sis upon which a State Program Approval Team evaluates the institution's evidence that candidates meet the Idaho Standards. The institution is expected to pr ovide information about candidate performance related to the Idaho Core Teacher Standards (and Idaho Teacher Standards for specific preparation areas). In addition to the standards listed here, science teachers must meet Idaho Core Teacher Standards and at least one of the following: (1 ) Idaho Standards for Biology Teachers, (2) Idaho Standards for Chemistry Teachers, (3) Idaho St andards for Earth and Space Science Teachers, (4) Idaho Standards for Natural Science Teacher s, (5) Idaho Standards for Physical Science Teachers, or (6) Idaho Standards for Physics Teachers.

Additiona lly, the structure of student portfolios and the investigation and field research experiences embedded in some of the science coursework indicate that LCSC is aware of and making an effort to transition to the recently adopted Standards for Science Teachers. However, we can find no evidence that candidates are making this actionable in their practice. This is a gene ral trend throughout the artifacts and interviews. It may be a function of th e small number of candidates in this program. Even though evidence, such as syllabi and inte rviews, reveal that ca ndidates read about the importance of understanding misconceptions (How Students Learn), we do not find evidence that candidates are demonstrating th eir knowledge of commonly held misconceptions either in writing lesson plans, nor is it embedded in their teaching or reflections. Evidence of \"engaging students in scientif ic inquiry\" is largely scripted labs. While candidates read both about recent developm ent in their field and about how people learn science, there is no evidence that students incorporate current research into their lesson plans, teaching, or reflection about teaching.

The State of Idaho, recognizing this demand and desiring to assure qualified teachers in online programs, has implemented an Online Teaching Endorsement to support teacher certification in the content areas. This endorsement includes both coursework and internship in the online environment, identifying ten widely accepted state standards that must be met. The Standards Committee of the Professional Standards Commission (PSC) conducted a New Program Approval Desk Review of the Online Teaching Endorsement program proposed by U of I . Through the comprehensive presentation, the Standards Committee gained a clear understanding that all of the Idaho Standards for Online Teachers would be met and/or surpassed through the proposed program. During its May 2014 meeting, the Professional Standards Commission voted to recommend Conditional Approval of the proposed Online Teaching Endorsement program offered through U of I. With the conditionally approved status, U of I may admit candidates to the Online Teaching Endorsement program, and will undergo full approval once there are program completers. English as a New Language Endorsement The demand for English as a New Language (ENL) teachers has continued to increase in Idaho. In order to help meet the current demand, U of I has submitted a proposal to offer an ENL endorsement program. The Standards Committee of the Professional Standards Commission (PSC) conducted a New Program Approval Desk Review of the ENL Endorsement program proposed by U of I.

These students are not required to pay the UI's tuition, but t he students are responsible for any other course fees. Students participating in these courses must be degree- seeking students at their home institution. Statement of Purpose Co-operative programs are based on one or more of the following criteria : Strengthen the academic program -- by providing access to complementary or unique program components (faculty, facilities, or other program rela ted information or materials). Support partnerships -- funded research/grants. Provide efficiencies -- resource and/or fiscal efficiencies that would not otherwise be available. Add, Drop, or Change of Status: Cooperative Institution: Rationale for request: Rationale and Assessment Information Rationale for approval of this request; include an explanation of how the department will manage the added workload of this new course and any relevant assessment information that applies to this course: This course will help meet Idaho State stand ards for teacher endorsement in ENL. This course is different from the currently of fered Modern Foreign Language Methods because it focuses on preparing students to teach English Language Learners in K-12 settings and differentiating instruction within the co re content in order to meet the divers e learning needs of English Language Learner s in public schools. This course will also focus on preparing students to meet the state certificati on English Language Development and Common Core standards. A new faculty member was hired in 2013 with a position description that includes developing and teaching this and other courses necessary fo r teacher certification in ENL, so the c ourse can be managed with the current School of Education resources.

Ingrid seconded. Can a student do one 30minute video to go for more than one additional endorsement? Ostensibly, yes.
