The ASR, provided to you in accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, is full of useful information about safety and security at UW -Madison. Within this guide you will find crime statistics for the previous three calendar years, statistics for on -campus residential housing fires for the previous three calendar years, campus safety and disci plinary policies, alcohol and drug policies, and policies that specifically address prevention of and response to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. While UW -Madison is generally a safe place to study and work, it is not wit hout the challenges that other institutions of similar size and scope face. There are many resources available to help you make informed decisions about your safety. In addition to the annual release of the ASR, UW - Madison uses multiple methods to communi cate about campus crime and major events. Beyond the wealth of information that is provided to you in this ASR, there are number of ways to keep informed about safety and security at UW -Madison. UW -Madison Police Department , Instagram and Facebook , as is Madison Police Department. UWPD also frequently communicates through press releases regarding incidents that happen in and around the campus area. I am also actively engaging with our community: chairing the Police Advisory Council, holding web chats and town halls, and sharing my own thoughts and views on law enforcement -related topics at the Chief's Corner at UWPD's website. By familiarizing yourself with UW -Madison's safety and security po licies, procedures, and programs, you are taking a significant step in protecting yourself and your community. The ASR contains a great deal of resources for students and employees who are in crisis, and we encourage you to tell us if you or someone you know needs help. We all have an important role to play in keeping ourselves, our fellow Badgers and our campus community safe. From all of us at UWPD, we hope you have a safe and successful school year. On Wisconsin! Sincerely, Kristen Roman Asso ciate Vice Chancellor/Chief of Police UW-Madison Police Department 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 8 COMPILATION OF THE 2019 ANNUAL SECURITY REPORT & ANNUAL FIRE SAFETY REPORT The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act requires the distribution o f an Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report to all current faculty, staff, and students and notice of its availability to prospective students, faculty, and staff. This document, referred to as the \"Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report\"' or \"ASR,\" is one of many mechanisms designed to inform current and potential UW -Madison community members of crime, arrest and referral statistics, of current crime response, reporting, prevention and awareness policies, including policies rega rding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking, of campus disciplinary policies and relevant state laws, and of campus safety and security. This ASR includes crime, arrest, and referral statistics for the previous three calendar y ears concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in certain off -campus buildings or property owned or controlled by the University of Wisconsin -Madison, and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from, the campus. The Fire Report at the end the document contains current UW -Madison Housing fire safety protocols and fire statistics for the previous three calendar years. This report is prepared by the University of Wisconsin -Madison Police Department (UWPD). To gather policies for this report, UWPD collaborated with the Division of Student Life, University Housing, the Office of Human Resources, University Health Services, the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics, the Office of Legal Affairs, the Title IX Coordinator a nd other divisions and departments on campus. In addition, representatives from University Communications assisted with the compilation this report. Statistics are gathered through reports to the University of Wisconsin -Madison Police Department (UWPD), the Dean of Students Office, the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, University Housing, the Title IX Coordinator, the Office of Human Resources and reports submitted by other Campus Security Authorities. UWPD also requested crime statistics from outside law enforcement agencies that may have jurisdiction over UW -Madison's non -campus property. UWPD and the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards collaborated in compiling the crime, arrest and referral statistics to ensure statistics are not missed or double counted. A copy of this report is disseminated to faculty, staff, and students in an e -mail sent in late September or early October of each fall semester. Crimes are classified using the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook, th e National Incident Based Reporting System Handbook and The Handbook for Campus Safety and Security Reporting (2016). Wisconsin law is used to define drug, liquor and weapons law violations, as well as incidents of domestic and dating violence. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 9 CAMPUS CR IME STATISTICS CHARTS In this chapter are statistical charts for calendar years 2018, 2017 and 2016. Charts for UW -Madison's School of Social Work Part -Time Master's Program which is held at UW -Eau Claire are found on page 23 . Differences in the statistics themselves reflect the number of crimes reported, and not necessarily a difference in the rate of crime itself. The data does not reflect prosecutions, convictions or the outcome of disciplinary actions. Crime statistics p ublished in this document reflect crimes that are reported to have occurred in one of four federally defined locations. Crimes that are reported to have occurred outside of the following locations are not included in this report. The four federally defin ed locations are: On-campus property is defined as any building or property owned or controlled by an institution within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area and used by the institution in direct support of, or in a manner related to, the institution's educational purposes, including residence halls; and any building or property that is within or reasonably contiguous to campus that is owned by the institution but controlled by another person, frequently used by students, and supports institutio nal purposes (such as a food or other retail vendor). On-campus student housing is defined as any student housing facility that is owned or controlled by the institution, or is located on property that is owned or controlled by the institution, and is wit hin the reasonably contiguous geographic area that makes up the campus. On campus student housing is a subset of on campus property in the crime statistics charts. Public property is defined as all public property, including thoroughfares, streets, sidewa lks, and parking facilities, that is within the campus, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from campus. Non -campus property is defined as any building or property owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the i nstitution; or any building or property that is owned or controlled by an institution that is used in direct support of, or in relation to, the institution's educational purposes, is frequently used by students and is not within the same reasonably contigu ous geographic area of the institution. This category includes property that is outside of Madison, outside of Wisconsin and outside of the United States.

UW -Madison Police Department (UWPD) The University of Wisconsin -Madison Police Department (UWPD) is a full -service, 24 - hour agency with approximately 70 sworn officer positions. Officers are armed and deputized. All UWPD police officers have the power and authority to make an arrest.

In addition, UWPD provides services through its own 911 Communications Center and are further supported by a non -sworn security division. Non -sworn security personnel do not have the power or authority to make arrests and are not armed. UWPD is the only law enforcement agency in the State of Wisconsin to be awarded accreditation by thr ee different accreditation agencies: the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA), the Wisconsin Law Enforcement Accreditation Group (WILEAG), and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA). SAFETY & SECURITY ON CAMPUS: LAW ENFORCEMENT & CRIME REPORTING 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 31 UWPD has nationally recognized specialty units including Bike Patrol, Police K9 and Motorcycle Units. UWPD was the first campus agency in the state to establish a community police officer position with a satellite office, and has community pol ice officers who are assigned to specific geographical areas of responsibility for community interaction, crime prevention, and problem solving. UWPD cooperates with local police and other state and federal authorities in the exercise of their responsibil ities. In addition, the UWPD offers security services with the primary responsibility of ensuring the security of campus properties. This is done with security consultations, patrols, and other services. UWPD maintains a strong working relationship with the Madison Police Department and other surrounding state and local law enforcement agencies. Staff participate in local and statewide meetings to share information and resources, as deemed necessary. UWPD does not have a memorandum of understanding with t he Madison Police Department or any other law enforcement agency regarding the investigation of criminal incidents, as UWPD has a full investigative division. UWPD's primary jurisdiction and patrol jurisdiction is the University of Wisconsin -Madison, inclu ding Lake Mendota by UWPD Lake Rescue & Safety. In the summer of 2019 UWPD began patrolling Upham Woods Camp in Juneau County during select shifts. Madison Police Department has primary jurisdiction over the City of Madison, and concurrent jurisdiction on UW- Madison's campus. UWPD is represented on university, county, and state committees that address sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, stalking, mental health concerns, traffic safety, bike and moped safety, community crime watch, emergency manag ement, alcohol and other drug abuse prevention, and threat assessment addressing campus safety concerns and behavioral interventions. UWPD encourages accurate and prompt reporting of all crimes to UWPD or other appropriate police agencies when the victim o f the crime elects to do so, or is unable to do so. Crime and Emergency Reporting Crimes and emergencies that occur on campus should be reported to the University of Wisconsin -Madison Police Department (UWPD) by dialing 911 in an event of an emergency, by calling the non -emergency number (608) 264 -2677, or by visiting the department at 1429 Monroe St., Madison, WI 53711. For the purpose of a making a crime warning evaluation and for potential inclusion of a crime statistic in the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, criminal offenses should be reported to UWPD, the Dean of Students Office , the Title IX Program or the Office of Workforce Relations in the Office of Human Resources. UWPD strongly encourages people to report crimes so that they may be evaluated for a crime warning. Crimes that occur off campus can be reported to the City of Madison Police Department via the non -emergency number (608) 255 -2345, by calling 911 from an off - campus location within Madison, or by going to the department at 211 S.

Victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking who do not wish to report the crime to a law enforcement official, the Dean of Students Office, the Title IX Coordinator or the Office of Workforce Relations are still encouraged to get help and support. Please see the Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and/or Stalking chapter in this report for more information. UW- Madison's policy regarding reporting child abuse is currently under review. T o comply with state law, all employees who become aware of potential child abuse or neglect should report to law enforcement or child protective services. Response to a Reported Crime UWPD dispatchers are available 24 hours a day. In response to a call regarding a reported crime, police officers will take the required action to investigate the crime, search for suspects, collect available evidence, file a report, and work with local prosecutors. In response to an emergency, UWPD will respond, evaluate, and summon the appropriate resources to respond to the incident. All of the cases that UWPD generates involving students are forwarded to the Dean of Students Office for review and potential action, such as initiating the student disciplinary process by referring the matter to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards when appropriate and/or offering support to student victims. Where applicable, the Title IX Coordina tor will also be informed. UWPD investigators will 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 33 investigate criminal reports and forward additional information obtained via the investigation to the Dean of Students Office. If assistance is required from the Madison Police or Fire Departments, or othe r local, state, or federal law enforcement agencies, UWPD will contact the appropriate agency. Response to crimes reported to the Dean of Students Office or the Office for Workforce Relations may include initiation of a disciplinary action or notice to la w enforcement if the crime involves a minor. Voluntary Confidential Crime Reporting UW- Madison does not provide voluntary, confidential crime reporting for the purposes of including crime statistic disclosures in the ASR. As a matter of policy, UW -Madi son directs people to report Clery crimes to UWPD, the Dean of Students Office, the Title IX Program or the Office of Workforce Relations for the purpose of including a statistic in UW- Madison's ASR; though people may report crimes to any Campus Security Authority. However, UW -Madison may be obligated to investigate when there is a report of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking. An online report form is used to collect statistical information for inclusion in the Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report and for Title IX related incidents. Though most often used by Campus Security Authorities, anyone may report a crime through this publicly available form. For possible follow -up and record keeping purposes, the form requires the name of the submitter. Click here to view the online reporting form. The report must include sufficient information as to the location and type of incident for inclusion in the ASR. If the crime did not occur on Clery Act designated geography, or it cannot be determined from the report whether th e incident(s) occurred on Clery Act designated geography or is a Clery crime, it will not be included in the ASR, as per federal regulations. For more information on Clery Act geography, please visit the Depar tment of Education's website by clicking here . The Clery staff at UWPD, the Title IX Coordinator and/or the Dean of Students Office/Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards review all submissions made through the report form. Please see the chapter in this ASR entitled Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking for more information regarding resources on and off campus where help can be received confidentially. Professional and Pastoral Counselors Campus \"professional counselors,\" when acting as such, are not considered to be Campus Security Authorities and are not required to report crimes for inclusion in the ASR or for a crime warning evaluation. Any Clery crime can be confidentially discussed with th ese employees and no crime statistic will be created in the ASR. UW -Madison does not employ pastoral counselors. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 34 Because UW -Madison does not have a mechanism for voluntary, confidential reporting for statistical inclusion in the ASR, UW -Madison does no t have a policy to encourage professional counselors to advise their clients of the procedures to report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for statistical inclusion in the Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Safety Report. Please see the chapter in this ASR entitled \"Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking\" for more information regarding official reporting and confidential resources for sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and/or stalking. Off -Campus Safety & Security The Madison Police Department (MPD) has primary jurisdiction in most areas off campus in the campus area. Other county, state and federal agencies also provide law enforcement services in the Madison area. MPD routinely works with UWPD, campus conduct officers, and the UW -Madison Center for Leadership and Involvement (CfLI) on any serious incidents occurring off campus when a UW -Madison student is involved. MPD has a designated officer liaison to the Langdon Neighborhood, which is the off -campus area that is home to many officially registered student organizations including fraternities and sororities. Under the advisement of the Fraternity and Sorority Advisor, student members of the fraternity and sorority governing boar ds (Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association) are in regular communication with the Langdon Neighborhood Police Officer regarding safety concerns and local ordinances. However, UW- Madison does not ask MPD to monitor criminal activity at off -camp us locations of registered student organizations; MPD does so because those residences are within their jurisdiction. UWPD assigns a liaison officer to work with MPD in the Langdon Street neighborhood. Greek governance council leaders from the Panhellenic Association and Interfraternity Council serve as peer monitors for pre- registered social fraternity and sorority events. The events involving alcohol may be hosted at both off -campus chapter house locations and third -party venues that possess the correct type of liquor license. The peer monitors fill out a checklist with chapter leadership at the event in order to evaluate if the chapter is following the policies set forth by their designated governance council. If the event is deemed unsafe by peer monit ors, they have been instructed to immediately contact the local police department. Policy violations are reported to the Interfraternity Council Judicial Board or the Panhellenic Association Judicial Board, which are non -institutional student- run judicial bodies for each respective council. When these reports show potential violations of the Student Organization Code of Conduct, the Committee on Student Organizations (CSO) reviews them and may take action. The CSO is a UW - Madison student organization con duct committee made up of faculty, staff and students. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 35 Clery Crime and Fire Log UWPD maintains a Clery Crime and Fire Log of crimes and on -campus residential housing fires which occur within UWPD's primary jurisdiction and about which the UWPD Clery sta ff receives notification. The information presented in the Log includes the Event #, which is an event reporting number by which UWPD may identify an incident. The absence of an Event #, noted as \"N/A\", indicates that a crime was not reported to UWPD, and that UWPD may consequently not be investigating this crime. The Log also includes the date and time which a crime or fire was reported to UWPD or the University, and the date and time at which a crime or fire occurred, or an estimate thereof. The column l abeled Report # may be used by the public to request additional information about a particular incident. The Location column identifies the street address at which the crime or fire occurred. The street address may not be specifically identified when this could compromise the privacy of a victim of sexual or intimate partner violence. The Offense column defines the nature of the crime or fire. The Disposition reveals the current stage of UWPD's criminal investigation into the offense, if one is taking place. Log entries are entered and updated in the log within two business days of UWPD receiving the information or within one business day of an update of a disposition.

The Unit coordinates with various university and community entities to ensure that UW -Madison students, fac ulty, staff, and visitors are prepared to respond to emergencies, recover from them, and mitigate against their impacts. The Emergency Management Unit also works closely with several campus partners to develop and implement UW -Madison's crisis communicatio n plan. Crisis and disaster events require campuses to not only prepare for such events, but also require an understanding of response capabilities and limitations. It is impossible to predict exactly when a crisis or disaster will occur, or the extent to which it might affect the campus. Through deliberate planning, preparing, and training, UW -Madison can greatly minimize losses from these events. When an emergency occurs, the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) is activated. The EOP delineates the response procedures for emergencies and disasters that impact the campus. When the EOP is utilized, two response organizations are established: the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the Executive Group. The EOC is staffed by pre- identified campus personnel trained to coordinate the campus' response and recovery efforts. EOC members are vetted UW -Madison personnel in middle to upper management positions from the major functional areas of the University, including, but not limited to, Facilities Planning & Managem ent, University Health Services, Student Affairs, Office of the Registrar, Division of Information Technology, Division of University Housing, University Recreation & Wellbeing, Intercollegiate Athletics, UWPD, University Communications, and the Office of Legal Affairs. The EOC facilitates sheltering of evacuees, debris removal, restoration of services, and supports on -scene personnel (list not all -inclusive). Campus leadership, including the Chancellor, Provost, Vice- Chancellors, and Deans comprise the Exe cutive Group. Their primary responsibilities include setting policy and providing support to the EOC and on -scene personnel. The Emergency Management Unit is also responsible for facilitating the completion of Occupant Emergency Plans (OEP) for each occup ied building on campus and coordinating Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP) for all UW System schools. The Unit provides training and information on five mission areas of emergency management: prevention, protection, mitigation, response and recovery. There is at least one COOP tabletop drill conducted each year. The Emergency Management Unit has primary responsibility for the development and facilitation of emergency exercises at UW -Madison. An After Action Report - SAFETY & SECURITY ON CAMPUS 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 38 Improvement Plan (AAR -IP) is writt en following each exercise that lists the scenario, participants, date, time, location, whether the test was announced or unannounced, areas of strengths, areas of improvement, and corrective actions. The campus is committed to evaluating response capabilities through the exercise and AAR -IP process, with the goal of correcting areas of improvement identified during the exercise. A four year cycle is utilized; within the four year cycle, a tabletop, functional and full -scale exercise is held which include t he EOC and Executive Group. The four year exercise cycle may be adjusted due to real -world emergencies that impact the exercise planning efforts. All buildings that are equipped with fire alarms have at least 1 fire drill each year. All academic buildings have at least 1 fire drill per year and all residence halls have at least 4 fire drills per year. Building evacuation drills are scheduled, documented, contain exercises involving a coordination of efforts, contain follow -through activities, and are desig ned for assessment and evaluation of emergency plans. A record of whether they are announced or unannounced is kept. Evacuation maps are posted in every building and on the door of every dorm room. All buildings have a posted evacuation plan, and all building evacuation plans will be tested during September 2019. All students and staff should familiarize themselves with the evacuation routes for the buildings they frequent. For more information about the Emergency Management Unit, please visit their website by clicking here . Blue Light Emergency Phones There are more than 100 Blue Light emergency telephones located throughout campus with a direct connection to the UWPD. Blue Light emergency telephones are tested monthly by UWPD and the Physical Plant provides maintenance. All emergency phones (with the exception of emergency phones located inside campus buildings and elevators) have a blue light above them. All emergency phones are lab eled \"Emergency.\" For more information about Blue Light emergency phones, please click here . 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 39 SAFE Nighttime Services SAFE (Safe Arrival for Everyone) Nighttime Services are UW -Madison's comprehensive late-night transportation system, available to students, faculty, staff, and university guests.

One method is keeping students and employees informed about crime prevention strategies and by communicating with the campus community about reported crimes or emergencies that pose serious or continuing threats to students and employees. This section highlights some of the ways in which UW -Madison offices c ommunicate information about crime and safety on campus. IMMEDIATE (EMERGENCY) NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES WiscAlerts This section describes the procedures UW -Madison uses to immediately notify the campus community upon the confirmation of a significant eme rgency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees occurring on the campus. Upon confirmation of an emergency or dangerous situation, UWPD will, without delay, and taking into account the safety of the community, determine the content of the notification and initiate the notification system, unless issuing a notification will, in the professional judgment of UWPD, compromise efforts to assist a victim or to contain, respond to or otherwise mitiga te the emergency. The notification system at UW -Madison is known as WiscAlerts. UWPD management typically confirms significant emergencies or dangerous situations involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees on campus with UWPD personnel and in conjunction with key administrative units, such as Facilities Planning & Management, Division of Information Technology, building managers, and/or the local first -responder agencies, and public health agencies. All UWPD managers a re authorized to initiate and use the WiscAlert system. During situations in which there is a time- critical threat to campus, a WiscAlert message and messages sent via the other systems listed below are sent immediately on authority of the UWPD Manager on Call (MOC) or other UWPD personnel if the MOC is unavailable. The COMMUNICATION ABOUT CAMPUS CRIMES & SAFETY 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 48 MOC or the MOC's designee is responsible for drafting the content, which is developed based on the type of emergency, determining the appropriate segment of the community to receive the mess age based on the affected community, and sending the message to the community using any or all systems listed below except the emergency telephone notification system, which is initiated by Dane County. If time permits, UW Communications may review media distributions prior to UWPD sending them. Situations for sending a WiscAlert include, but are not limited to: active harmer, significant and serious hazardous materials spill, closing a section of campus, significant disruptions to campus infrastructure, multiple building closings, or a mass casualty disaster. All students and staff have a wisc.edu email address, and WiscAlerts are typically sent via email in an effort to notify the largest percentage of students and staff in the fastest way possible. Usually, WiscAlerts are also sent via text message to those registered with the text system. In addition to, or in the event of an email or text system failure, UW - Madison may use some or all of the following systems to communicate an immediate threat to the community: voice calls, other warning mechanisms such as Twitter, Dane County's emergency telephone notification system (in coordination with Dane County), and media distribution. In the event of an outbreak of a serious illness or other public health emergency, the Executive Director of University Health Services or designee will typically collaborate with UWPD' s MOC or designee to confirm the emergency, draft the language of the warning and distribute the warning to the affected campus community. Situations requiring a WiscAlert will almost always require ongoing communications support. UWPD will determine what level emergency is present and use the Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). Once the EOP is activated, the process of posting information on UW- Madison's homepage and preparing a crisis communications response will begin. Depending on the type of emergency, U WPD, the Joint Information Center and/or University Communications may work together to craft a consistent set of follow -up messages that can be efficiently distributed to update the UW -Madison and larger community, including through additional WiscAlerts or through the UW -Madison homepage (www.wisc.edu), the Parent Program website (www.parent.wisc.edu), and/or the My UW Portal. UW- Madison may also communicate through email and text message to provide follow -up communication. The EOP Joint Information Cen ter and/or University Communications on- call staff will also provide assistance in responding to media inquiries. In certain emergency situations, a campus affiliate group, such as UW Hospital may also propose sending a text message via WiscAlerts. Such requests will be evaluated on a case - by-case basis by the UWPD MOC, using the criteria listed above. Parents and the larger community can receive information pertaining to an emergency situation at the university through some or all the following Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 49 Twitter feed (@UWMadisonPolice), UWPD Facebook -Madison Twitter feed (@UWMadison) and media distribution. In addition, the Parent Program has the ability to communicate with parents who are part of the program. Crime Warnings UW- Madison issues Crime Warnings to war n the campus community about certain crimes that present a continuing threat to the campus community and to aid in the prevention of similar crimes. Known in the Clery Act as a \"timely warning,\" the intent of a Crime Warning is to warn of a criminal incide nt so that people will be enabled to protect themselves. Crime warnings are issued in a manner that is timely, withholds the names of victims as confidential, and that will aid in the prevention of similar occurrences. The Clery Act requires UW - Madison to distribute Crime Warnings regarding certain crimes that occur within UW - Madison's Clery geography and represent a serious or continuing threat to the safety of students or employees. These crimes are murder/non -negligent manslaughter, manslaughter by neg ligence, rape, fondling, statutory rape, incest, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, arson, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. Larceny -theft, simple assault, intimidation and vandalism will be assessed for a crime warn ing if there is evidence they were motivated by hate or bias against a protected party. UWPD's Manager on Call (MOC) or the MOC's designee has the authority to develop the content of a Crime Warning and authorize distribution using the guidelines listed below. The MOC or designee will consider the type of offense, location, nature of any threat and whether there is a continuing threat to the community or a continuing crime pattern in determining the appropriateness of a Crime Warning. Some information may be withheld if there is a risk of compromising law enforcement efforts to investigate and/or solve the crime. If the victim of the crime is a person, that person will not be identified by name in a Crime Warning. Crime Warnings are issued as soon as the p ertinent information is available to the UWPD MOC or designee. Crimes will be assessed on a case -by-case basis and Crime Warnings will be distributed as deemed necessary. Cases of aggravated assault involving known parties, such as two roommates fighting which result in an aggravated injury, will be evaluated on a case -by- case basis to determine if an individual is believed to be an ongoing threat to the larger UW- Madison community. Cases of sexual assault will be considered on a case -by-case basis to det ermine whether there is an ongoing threat to the larger UW -Madison community, depending on the facts of the case, when and where the incident occurred, 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 50 when it was reported, and the amount of information known by UWPD. Crime Warnings will not typically be issued for property crimes unless there is some evidence of a pattern or a serious, continuing threat to the community. The following factors will be considered when determining whether to issue a Crime Warning: Where the crime occurred The nature of the crime (serious/non -serious, violent/non -violent) The nature of the threat (general threat versus limited threat to a specific person) Whether or not there is a continuing danger to the community or continuing crime pattern When UWPD becomes aware of a situation that meets the criteria fo r a Crime Warning, the Manager o n Call (MOC) or designee develops the content of the Crime Warning, has the authority to authorize the distribution and distributes the Crime Warning to the community. In the event a Crime Warning is needed, consideration will be given to the most appropriate means to be used to disseminate the information to the UW -Madison community. The primary form of distribution is through a mass email message to the entire university community. This email is sent by the MOC or the MOC's designee, including, but not limited to, UWPD's Public Information Officer. Other forms of communication may be utilized, such as UWPD Facebook and UWPD Twitter. In addition, Crime Warning notices may also be shared by postings on www.wisc.edu , the UWPD homepage, press releases, postings/notices at appropriate locations, or the use of UWPD electronic signboards. Other Campus Security Authorities learning of an incident in which a Crime Warning might be appropriate will share the information with the Clery staff at UWPD to determine whether the incident meets the criteria for a Crime Warning. A Crime Warning notice will typically include the following, unless issuing any of this information would risk compromising law enforcement efforts: The date and time or time -frame of the incident A brief description of the incident Information that will promote safety and potentially aid in the prevention of similar crimes (crime prevention or safety tips) Suspect description(s)/photo(s) when deemed appropriate and if there is sufficient detail Police agency contact information Other information as deemed appropriate. UWPD does not issue a Crime Warning notice for the above listed crimes if: The MOC or designee determines there is no serious or continuing threat to the safety of UW -Madison students and employees UWPD apprehends the subject(s) and the threat of imminent danger to members of the UW -Madison community have been mitigated by th e apprehension 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 51 A report was not filed with UWPD or UWPD was not notified of the crime in a manner that would allow the department to post a \"timely\" warning for the community (e.g. a report that was filed more than 7 days after the date of the alleged inc ident may not allow UWPD to post a \"timely\" warning to the community). This type of situation will be evaluated on a case -by-case basis. For more information about Crime Warnings, please click here .

Information about Sex Offenders The federal Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act requires institutions of higher education to issue a statement to the campus community about where to find information on registered sex offenders in the state. It also requir es sex offenders who are already required to register with the state to notify that state if they are enrolled, carry on a vocation or are employed in a post -secondary institution. In Wisconsin, convicted sex offenders must register with the Department of Corrections; a registry can be found at offender.doc.state.wi.us/public. The Wisconsin Department of Corrections supplies information to UWPD regarding registered sex offenders who are enrolled or employed at UW- Madison. This information can also be found on the UWPD website by clicking here . 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 52 Creating a safe campus is everyone's responsibility. The following programs are offered to inform the campus community about campus security procedures and practices, to encourage the campus community to be responsible for their safety and the safety of others, and to inform students and employees about crime prevention. Badger Watch Badger Watch is a crime prevention program for the UW -Madison campus. It is a collaborative effort between community members and UWPD to help make the community a safer place. UWPD provides Badger Watch training campus -wide to groups, departments and individuals.

For more information, click here . Bystander Intervention Tips Bystander intervention means safe and positive options that may be carried out by an individual or individuals to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, or sexual harassment. Bystander intervention includes recognizing situations of potential harm, understanding institutional structures and cultural conditions that facili tate violence, overcoming barriers to intervening, identifying safe and effective intervention options, and taking action to intervene. Many people assume that sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking only involve the victim/survivor and perpetrator, but at UW - Madison we recognize that every campus community member is responsible for preventing violent behavior and helping to create a safe and respectful environment. If you see something that concerns you, you have many options for in tervening safely and effectively: Be active in supporting a safe and respectful community. If you see others engaging in disrespectful or inappropriate actions, speak up and get involved, or contact someone to assist. Listen for rape jokes and sexist language. Choose not to laugh or participate, or start a conversation about the harmful impact of this language on survivors, women, and transgender and gender -nonconforming people If you see someone who looks to be in immediate danger, get help. This can include alerting someone who is nearby and in a position to assist or calling 911 You can intervene even after an assault. Learn what options sexual assault survivors have available to them on this campus and be supportive of their choices. Believe surviv ors when they share experiences. If you're a bystander and see someone behaving in a way that seems disrespectful or predatory, be direct and do something about it, such as distracting their attention away from a potential victim. If you don't feel comfortable or safe confronting them, find someone else who can help, such as someone who knows them or a host, bouncer, bartender, security, manager, etc. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 61 If you sense that something is wrong, don't ignore it, you can help by getting involved. Check -in and ask, \"Hey, do you know this person?\" or, \"Are you OK?\" or, \"Can I call a friend to walk you home?\" It can feel awkward to say something if you notice harmful behavior, but often all it takes is a brief introduction. Let the potential perpetrator know that their actions are noticeable with a simple, \"Hey, do I know you? Aren't you in Tuesday Chemistry section?\" When you go out, consider going out as part of a group and talk to your friends ahead of time about how you will look out for others and support each other in intervening if someone needs help. People tend to intervene in situations when they have friends who they know will back them up. Protective Behaviors and Risk Reduction: What Everyone Can Do Risk reduction means options designed to decrease perpetration and bystander inaction, and to increase empowerment for victims in order to promote safety and to help individuals and communities address conditions that facilitate violence. It is possible to follow all of these tips and still be the target of someone else's harmful behavior. No matter what choices you make, you deserve to be safe and respected, and experiencing violence is never your fault. Have respectful, open and ongoing conversations with your partner or potential partner about sex and se xual contact. Talk about your boundaries and what behaviors you both feel comfortable, and uncomfortable, engaging in. The next time you hear yourself talking about gender or sex in a derogatory way, stop. Speak up when you hear others talk this way\u2014 no mat ter their gender. Listen to or read the personal story of a survivor of violence. Make sure you have affirmative and ongoing consent from your partner. Consent is a clear and freely given yes, not the absence of a no. When you have engage in any sexual act ivity be sure you understand your partner's limits, and communicate your own limits clearly. Don't engage in sexual activities without affirmative consent from your partner. Consent to one act does not mean consent to other acts. Communicate and be respons ive to every partner's feelings, boundaries, and needs. You must continually practice consent for any and all sexual activity. If someone seems not okay with what's happening, it is your responsibility to check in and to stop if you have any doubts about t heir comfort or consent to what is happening . Most commonly, sexual assault is perpetrated not by a stranger but by someone the victim knows, typically a date or acquaintance. It's important that everyone be active and observant bystanders. People who are incapacitated by alcohol or drugs cannot consent. Signs of incapacitation may include \u2014but are not limited to \u2014throwing up, slurring words, stumbling, or not being able to remember conversations. Even without showing these signs, if you know someone has bee n drinking heavily throughout the night, they likely are not able to consent. Do not pressure others to drink or use drugs and be alert to people pressuring you or others to use. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 62 Alcohol and drugs are often used to create vulnerability to sexual assault. S tudies of sexual assault incidents show a high correlation between sexual assault perpetration, victimization and drug/alcohol usage. Each individual has the right to make their own decisions about drinking. No one should be pressured to consume more than they want to. Some perpetrators target people by using alcohol as a weapon. Use and encourage others to have a companion or a safe means of getting home, i.e., a trusted frien d, taxi, or SAFEwalk at (608) 262.5000. If an authority figure pressures you to engage in sexual activity, you are encouraged to tell someone if that is a safe option like, confidential resources in the campus or in the community. This is a violation of University policy , and your employment or academic success should never be used as leverage to pressure you to do something you do not want to. Understand that crime victims are never responsible for the behavior of perpetrators, and actively share this message with others. If you've been sexually assaulted or victimized there are resources available to help. Signs of an abusive dating partner may include someone who: Calls you names, insults you or continually criticizes you Does not trust you and acts possessive or jealous Tries to isolate you from family or friends Takes your possessions to punish you and refuses to return them Monitors where you go, who you call, and who you spent time with Controls finances or refuses to share money Punishes you by withholding affection Expects you to ask permission from them to do what you w ant to do Threatens to hurt you, your family, your pets, or your belongings Threatens and/or uses a weapon against you Has ever forced, coerced, or manipulated you into having sex or performing sexual acts Accuses you of cheating or is often jealous of you r relationships with others Traps you in your apartment or residence hall room and keeps you from leaving Social media messages, tweets, text messages, and/or calls you obsessively to find out where you are and what you are doing Uses harmful language rela ted to race, gender, ability, sexual orientation, ethnicity and national origin.

The petitioner must show emotional, physical or sexual abuse of the child committed by the respondent. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 67 How t o File for a Restraining Order Restraining Order paperwork is available in the Legal Resource Center in the Dane County Courthouse, Room L1007. Once victims have filled out the Restraining Order packet, go to the Records Center in Room 1000 to sign the Petition in front of a notary (Records Center staff will perform the Notary Act). Records Center staff will summon a Court Commissioner via email. Once a Court Commissioner has reviewed the material, and assuming they have approved the same, Records Center s taff will make all necessary copies. File all papers with the Clerk of Courts in Room 1000 of the Dane County Courthouse, and follow the next step regarding serving the restraining order. The Commissioner will schedule an injunction hearing and issue a Tem porary Restraining Order (TRO) if appropriate. The TRO is in effect until the injunction hearing. This hearing must be held within fourteen days of the TRO being issued. Serving a Restraining Order The TRO must be served (officially delivered) to make it enforceable. It also must be served to let the respondent (alleged abuser) know about the court date for the injunction hearing. Take the papers next door to the Public Safety Building (Dane County J ail) and give them to the Sheriff's Department, where they will serve these papers on the defendant for a fee. Call the Sheriff's Department at (608) 284 -6800 to see if the respondent has been served or to give the Sheriff new information about where the r espondent can be found. A private process server may also serve the papers for a fee. If the respondent contacts you after being served, call the police immediately. Keep a copy of your restraining order with you at all times. If the police arrive and discover the respondent has not yet been served, an officer can serve one of your extra copies. If you need the police to serve your papers, ask the officer to write the following on the copy you are going to keep: The date and the police officer's name a nd badge number Abuser or harasser's name and type of papers served. Ask the officer to notify the Sheriff's Department by phone and/or in writing that the respondent has been served. Injunction Hearings This is the court hearing to grant your long- term Restraining Order. You may bring an attorney if you wish. Please be on time. If your case is called and you do not show, the restraining order will be dropped. If you are running late, call the Probate Office at (608) 266-4331. The date and time of your hearing will not be changed. If you miss your court date, you may need to show that there has been a new incident of violence in order to file papers again. If you and the respondent appear in court, both of you will testify. If the respondent has been served with a Notice to Appear but does not come to court, the hearing will be based on your testimony alone. You will be under oath. Take your time, admit if you don't remember something, if you are afraid, hav e defended yourself, called the police, if the respondent has been arrested, and if they have violated the Restraining 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 68 Order. Be polite and don't interrupt the respondent's testimony. You will have a chance to respond or ask the respondent questions. Focus on the following issues when you testify in court: When and where the abuse took place - location, time, and date of e ach incident starting with the most recent Physical abuse - hitting, choking, slapping, kicking, forcing sex, etc. Threats of physica l harm or violence - threatening to kill you, burn down the house, etc. Injuries or pain - bruises, scratches, pain from being punched, etc. Weapons - guns, knives, broomsticks, any object used to hurt you Evidence - pictures, medical records, police repor ts, etc. Witnesses - anyone who has seen or heard the respondent threaten or harm you Harassment - unwanted and repeated phone calls, visits and/or con tact which you have asked this person to stop. In Wisconsin, the term \"harassment\" describes unwan ted con tact, physical abuse or threats of violence. If the commissioner finds that domestic abuse, harassment, or child abuse has occurred, they may order an injunction (long -term Restraining Order) for as long as the petitioner requests, but not to exceed four years for domestic abuse and two years for harassment or child abuse. A restraining order helps to protect you, but it does not guarantee your safety. Follow a safety plan, especially if you believe that being arrested is not going to stop the respondent f rom trying to hurt you. Enforcing a Restraining Order If the respondent violates the Restraining Order, call the police immediately. The respondent has just committed a crime. Ask the police to have the District Attorney's office review the case for char ges even if no arrest is made. If the respondent is on probation or parole, give a copy of the Restraining Order to the parole agent and report any violations. To find out who their probation agent is, call the Department of Corrections Central Records at (608) 240 -3750 and provide the person's name or birthday. UW -Madison & Restraining Orders UW- Madison and UWPD will enforce active restraining orders issued by a court of law, including tribal courts, when provided notice of the order. Students who have a court - issued restraining order and wish to inform the UW should contact the Dean of Students office or UWPD. Students who need to be provided additional accommodations regarding a restraining order should contact the Dean of Students Office, the Title IX Coordinator or UWPD. Employees who have a court issued restraining order should notify the Office of Human Resources, the Title IX Coordinator or UWPD.

No Contact Directives Issued by UW -Madison One tool the University of Wisconsin -Madison uses to support a safe, respectful, and responsible educational and working en vironment, either as a proactive measure or in response to and prevention of additional incidents, is a no contact directive. A no contact directive is a university -issued directive that prohibits the recipient from having contact with the individual or i ndividuals named in the directive. The no contact directive is different than a restraining order/civil injunction issued by a court of law and may be issued independent of campus investigatory/disciplinary processes. A no contact directive is issued when an authorized University employee determines that an individual should be prohibited from having contact with another person or persons. The individuals listed in a no contact directive can include, but might not be limited to: complainants, respondents a nd witnesses. No contact directives are often issued during the course of investigating cases which involve allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/dome stic violence, and/or stalking. Students No contact directives can be issued by the D ean of Students Office, or by the Title IX Program when there are allegations of sexual harassment or sexual violence. A no contact directive is issued in writing via a student's university email, and when possible, verbally. Recipients of the no contact d irective are informed that future contact with the individual or individuals named in the directive may be considered harassment and could result in a disciplinary investigation. If the individuals involved are in student organizations or classes together, the parameters of the no contact directive will be discussed and additional expectations for minimizing contact may be added to the written correspondence. Students will be provided with an opportunity to ask questions about the terms of 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 70 the no contact di rective issued to them. No contact directives issued by the Dean of Students Office will include a written notification of the right and process to appeal. When issued, a no contact directive does not have an end date. The no contact directive can also be modified or terminated with the agreement of the parties. Any changes to a no contact directive will be communicated to the parties in writing. Students who violate a no contact directive risk being charged and investigated through the nonacademic miscon duct process for UWS 17.09 (3) Stalking and/or UWS 17.09(11) False Statement or Refusal to Comply Regarding a University Matter. Information regarding the no contact directive is maintained in a s tudent database and does not appear on an internal or external transcript. Employees Supervisors, in consultation with Human Resources staff, have the authority to regulate workplace behavior of Academic and University staff, and the Provost may regulate faculty, as long as there is a work -related reason for doing so. The Title IX Program may also issue a no contact directive for any employee. No contact directives are typically issued in a letter to the recipient. UW -Madison may issue no contact directiv es to employees when appropriate circumstances arise. Circumstances under which a no contact directive may be issued include, but are not limited to, pending disciplinary investigations. A no contact directive may limit an employee's contact with another e mployee, a student, or other member of the University community or limit an employee's contact with a work location for a length of time determined by the employee's supervisor or the Provost. The following types of contact may be prohibited by a no contact directive: face -to- face/in -person, telephone, e- mail, text message, social networking sites, written communication, video and other electronic communication, and contact through third parties. Violation of a no contact directive issued by UW -Madison may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Employees may have the ability to challenge a no contact directive by using the grievance process for their employment category when they believe the no contact directive is impacting their abili ty to perform the functions of their employment. Requesting a No Contact Directive Requests for no contact directives will be reviewed on a case- by-case basis and will take into account factors such as safety, alleviating a hostile environment, and educational and employment needs. Parties may request a no contact directive by contacting one of the following offices: the Dean of Students, the Title IX Program or the Office of Human Resources. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 71 Enforcing a No Contact Directive If your no contact dir ective is being violated, please contact the office that issued it. If you are in immediate danger, contact 911. NOTICE OF ACCOMMODATIONS AND CONFIDENTIAL RESOURCES Notice of Accommodations Students and employees who report sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking to UW -Madison will receive written notification about existing counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, legal assistance, visa and immigration assistance, student financial aid, and other services available for victims, both within the institution and in the community.

This information is also provided to all students and employees in this ASR. UW- Madison will maintain as confidential any accommodations or protective measures provided to the victim, to the extent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the ability of UW -Madison to provide accommodations or protective measures. When determining what measures to grant, factors considered might include, but are not limited to: the specific need requested by the complainant, the age of the people involved, the severity or pervasiveness of the allegations, any c ontinuing effects on the complainant, whether the complainant and alleged perpetrator share the same residence hall, dining hall, job location, classes, extracurricular activities or whether judicial measures have already been taken to protect the complain ant. The individual affected units should consult with the Title IX Coordinator, Office of Workforce Relations and/or Dean of Students Office to determine whether or not a specific accommodation is appropriate. The following offices can provide informatio n and assistance to those requesting accommodations and changes to academic, living, transportation, working situations and other protective measures: 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 72 CONFIDENTIAL RESOURCES For victims who choose to not report to law enforcement and/or to a campus office, there are several options available.

In an effort to protect victim safety and privacy, UW -Madison maintains information about sexual violence in a secure m anner. If the University has notice of an incident, UW - Madison will balance the victim's request to keep identifying information confidential with Title IX's mandate to investigate hostile environments. To the extent permissible by law, UW -Madison will e ndeavor to keep victim and necessary party information private. However, once a report is made to the University, or the University has notice of an incident of sexual assault, sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, confidentia lity cannot be guaranteed unless that information is reported directly to one of the confidential resources listed. UW -Madison will strive to maintain as confidential any accommodations or protective measures provided to the victim, but keeping victim inf ormation confidential may limit UW - Madison's ability to provide accommodations or protective measures. For victims aged 18 and older who report to non -confidential sources, reports of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking are directed to the Title IX Coordinator, who will share relevant information only with those who need to know, such as Deputy Title IX Coordinators, complaint investigators, and other individuals who are responsible for handling the school's response to inci dents, or as necessary to comply with the Wisconsin Public Records law, a valid subpoena, a lawful discovery request, or a governmental inquiry or investigation. UW -Madison follows applicable Title IX guidance and the requirements of the federal Family Ed ucational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. s. 1232g, when evaluating whether to disclose student information. In the case of minors, UW- Madison employees must report child abuse to Child Protective Services or local law enforcement. For Clery Act reporting and disclosures, a victim's name or identifying information will never appear in a Crime Warning, on the Daily Crime Log or in the ASR. UW -Madison will redact a victim's identifying information when responding to requests for information pursuan t to the Wisconsin Public Records law. The University also will not disclose identifiable information about research subjects if prohibited by an NIH -issued Certificate of Confidentiality, HIPAA regulations and state laws pertaining to the privacy of healt h information or promises of confidentiality made to research subjects pursuant to the federally required consent form and authorization form. UW -Madison must respond to valid subpoenas that are not prohibited by other applicable law, and may not be able t o redact information when responding to a subpoena. There are confidential resources available such as UHS Mental Health Services, UHS Survivor Services, UHS Medical Services, UW -Madison Ombuds and the Employee 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 77 Assistance Office. Other licensed healthcare providers, counselors and social workers employed by the University follow the confidentiality requirements of their profession when they are providing care to a patient or a client. Additionally, staff from the McBurney Disability Resource Center, campus Disability Coordinators, Divisional Disability Representatives and interpreters do not disclose reports of prior victimization that they become aware of as part of the disability accommodation process or when providing translation services. For informati on about off -campus and non -UW affiliated confidential resources, please see the \"Off -Campus Confidential Resources\" section of this chapter. This section discusses commonly asked questio ns regarding on and off campus resources in regards to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. It also includes various protective measures UW -Madison may take to assist individuals who report domestic violence, dating violence, se xual assault and stalking, such as providing changes to academic, working and living situations. For information regarding no contact orders issued by UW -Madison, please see the \"Reporting and Resources\" section of this chapter. What happens if I decide to report sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking to UWPD? You always have the option to report to law enforcement and UW -Madison encourages you to report sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking to UWPD. You can call 911 from on campus, call (608) 264 -2677, come into UWPD at 1429 Monroe Street or you can call and request to have an officer come to you. An officer from UWPD can meet you in your residence hall, apartment or anywhere else you feel s afe. In all cases, the first thing a responding officer will do will be to establish your safety. Officers will then evaluate your need for medical attention, and discuss the option of going to the hospital. If you decide to go to the hospital, the officer will transport you, wait for you and take you home. You are also welcome to bring a friend, for support. In the event of a sexual assault, an advocate from Dane County Rape Crisis will be contacted to support you. The responding officer will conduct a b asic interview about what happened, and a detective will be assigned to your case. UWPD has both female and male detectives, who are specially trained to investigate sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking. You may request an off icer with the gender you feel most comfortable with to take your statement and UWPD will do it best to facilitate the request. UWPD will not pressure you to engage in a lengthy discussion right away. The main goals are to establish your safety, assist you with obtaining medical attention, preserve evidence, and create a safety plan. UWPD detectives have extensive training on trauma, ON-CAMPUS AND OFF -CAMPUS RESOURCES COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 78 and appreciate that it is best to conduct a more extensive interview after at least 24 hours. After your initial report a de tective will set up a time to meet when you feel comfortable. After meeting with the Detective, they will begin an investigation - keep in mind there is no pressure to proceed with any charges. UWPD will conduct a thorough investigation, and at the concl usion, will discuss your options. The detective will ask you questions about what happened, create a safety plan with you and will explain how the investigation, judicial process and, if the offender is a student, how the student disciplinary processes work. At the conclusion of the investigation, if you decide to request UWPD to proceed with the charges, the detective will thoroughly explain the process, and will keep you updated on the proceedings. You are not in this alone, your detective and UWPD are here for you. In regard to a stalking or domestic violence case, your safety and security is key. UWPD will assist you in obtaining a restraining order or a no contact directive as well as accessing local resources, including advocacy and the crime response program. If you live in UW -Madison housing and need a housing accommodation, your detective can work with University Housing to arrange it, if it is reasonably available. If you want UWPD to reach out to your parents, UWPD will do that, too - but only if you decide that is what you want. Will UWPD be able to keep my personal information private? Although police reports are subject to public records laws, redactions may be made prior to release. Personal information such as street address, phone number and date of birth (except age or year of birth) are usually removed from most responses to public record requests. Additional information may be redacted, including taking the name to initials only, based on the balancing test of the public right to know versus priv acy rights of the individual. If you request that UWPD proceed with charges, UWPD will typically forward an unredacted police report and other investigation information to the Dane County District Attorney's Office for review by the prosecutor. Note tha t an accused person's Attorney will likely also have access to the unredacted report. However in cases of violence, the District Attorney's Office has made some exceptions and redacted reports. This decision is made on a case -by-case basis by the District Attorney's Office, and not by UWPD. There are laws in place to protect victims of sex crimes who testify in court. Evidence concerning your past sexual conduct, other people's opinions of your past sexual conduct, and any reputation as to prior sexual con duct are typically inadmissible in court, subject 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 79 to exceptions. If you request UWPD to proceed with charges, UWPD can give you more information regarding these \"rape shield\" laws as they apply in Wisconsin.

Upon completion of a suspension period, a student who is academically eligible may re- enroll, provided all conditions from previous disciplinary sanctions have been met. Denial of specified university privileges may include such sanctions as restrictions on participation in extra -curricular activities, depending on the facts of the case and the status of the parties. Educational or service sanctions can include, but is not limited to, participating in prevention programming, taking a drug and alcohol abuse assessment, taking a counseling assessment, or mandatory alcohol education. Such sanctions, if imposed, will be determined on a case- by-case basis. THE STUDENT DISCIPLINARY PROCESS In addition to Chapter UWS 17, UW -Madison has implemented supplemental disciplinary procedures for investigations and hearings involving sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking, pursuant to federal law and U WS 17.03. Sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking cases receive a prompt, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution. The process described below provides a summary of what can be expected from the student disciplinary process. After the summary, the relevant language from Chapter UWS 17 itself is provided for reference. Investigation If a report is received alleging that a student has engaged in conduct that may violate Chapter UWS 17 as it applies to Title IX, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking, the information will be provided to the Title IX Coordinator within the Office of Compliance. If the alleged misconduct includes sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/o r stalking and UW- Madison proceeds with the disciplinary process, the Title IX Coordinator or designated Title IX investigator (\"Title IX Program\") will begin an investigation. The University's Title IX Program serves as the primary investigator in studen t discipline cases involving allegations of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and/or stalking. The Title IX Program employees receive extensive annual and ongoing training on the approaches and techniques for conducting comprehensive and impartial investigations, including training on how to gather and weigh evidence, trauma - informed interviewing techniques, and recognizing and adjusting for potential conflicts of interest. The Title IX Program employees also receive training on how to cond uct investigations that are aligned with the University's student discipline process. In some 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 94 cases, the University uses additional investigators who are hired on a contract basis. These investigators receive similar training. Investigations and resolutio ns of these cases proceed regardless of any criminal investigation or proceeding. An investigation may be temporarily delayed while law enforcement gathers evidence, then will be promptly resumed and completed. Any delays or extensions will be communicated to the complainant and student respondent. Prior to the start of an investigation, the complainant, if known, is provided with written notification of existing counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, legal assistance and other services available both on campus and in the community, along with written explanation of the complainant's rights and options. The complainant does not have to agree to participate in the disciplinary process to receive resources. Both the complainant and student respondent have the right to be accompanied to interviews, meetings and hearings by a support person of their choosing, and UW -Madison will not limit the choice of support person. If the complainant agrees to be interviewed, the complainant may be accompanied by a person of their choosing and will meet with the assigned investigator. Once the complainant interview is complete, the investigator will send a letter to the student respondent that includes the allegations and an invitation to meet. The student respo ndent may be accompanied by a support person of their choosing at the meeting. The investigator will also interview relevant witnesses and/or review relevant witness statements, if any, and review any documentary or other evidence provided by the complain ant, the student respondent or other sources, including witnesses. Once the investigation is complete, the investigator will prepare a report outlining the information gathered in the investigation. The report will be submitted to an Assistant Dean in the Division of Student Life (DSL) or an Associate Director in the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. The Assistant Dean/Associate Director assigned to the case will review the information in the report to determine if the evidentiary standard, preponderance of the evidence, has been met and whether any violation of UWS Chapter 17 occurred. Assistant Deans/Associate Directors involved in cases related to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking receive annual training related to those issues. In most cases, the Assistant Dean/ Associate Director consults with at least two other members of the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS) in making this determination. Once a decision has been reached, the Ass istant Dean/ Associate Director sends a letter to both the complainant and the student respondent outlining the findings and, where applicable, the recommended sanction(s). At all steps of the process, regardless of whether there is a finding of responsibility against the student respondent, reasonable measures will be taken to ensure mitigation of any hostile environment for the complainant. If the Assistant Dean/Associate Director determines the student respondent is not responsible for the alleged misco nduct by a preponderance of the evidence, the complainant may appeal the Assistant Dean/Associate Director's determination. The 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 95 appeal must be made, in writing, within fourteen days of receiving written notification of the Assistant Dean's \"no preponderanc e\" determination. The appeal should be sent to the Office of the Chancellor at: chancellor@news.wisc.edu . The chancellor's or designee's decision shall be based upon the record gathered during the investigation. The decision of the Assistant Dean will be upheld unless the chancellor or designee finds: (a) The information in the record does not support the f indings or decision; (b) Appropriate procedures were not followed which resulted in mat erial prejudice to the student respondent or complainant; or (c) The decision was based on factors proscribed by state or federal law. Upon receiving a timely written appeal of a \"no preponderance\" determination, the Office of the Chancellor or designee will notify the student respondent. The chancellor or designee shall issue a written decision within thirty days. The written decision will be simultaneously sent to the complainant and the student respondent. If the determination of \"no preponderance\" is reversed, the chancellor or designee may: send the case back for further investigation, send the case back for hearing, or order other appropriate relief consistent with the Wisconsin Administrative Code Chapter UWS Chapter 17. If the determination of \"no preponderance\" is upheld, the complainant may appeal to the Board of Regents of the Univers ity of Wisconsin System. The Board of Regents, in its discretion, may consider an appeal based on the written record. The appeal must be made, in writing, within fourteen days of receiving the written decision from the chancellor or designee. The timelin e for the resolution of the appeal to the Board of Regents is at the discretion of the Board of Regents. The appeal should be sent to the Office of the Board of Regents at: board@uwsa.edu Appealing parties should sub mit a written position statement that addresses the following: (1) whether the case involves substantial constitutional claims, (2) whether there is a serious concern that the chancellor has abused his/her discretion or exceeded his/her authority, (3) whet her the decision made at the institutional level could have system -wide implications, or (4) whether the final institutional decision is based upon facts not supported by the record, resulting in material prejudice to the individual seeking the review. If the Board grants review, the subcommittee may receive additional information for consideration, including oral presentations, and then makes a recommendation to the full Board. Hearing If the Assistant Dean/Associate Director determines that misconduct occurred, the student respondent has the right to a formal hearing to contest the determination that the student respondent engaged in misconduct, contest the disciplinary action recommended, or both. At UW -Madison, hearings for sexual assault, dating/ dom estic violence, and stalking are conducted only via hearing committee. The hearing may be scheduled at the student respondent's request or may be scheduled automatically, depending on the recommended sanction. In cases where the recommended discipline includes suspension or expulsion, Chapter UWS 17 provides for the hearing to be scheduled automatically unless the student respondent waives the right to the hearing in writing via a settlement agreement. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 96 Separate academic and nonacademic misconduct hearing committees are appointed by the chancellor or designee and include faculty, academic staff, and student members. Members are nominated for appointment by their respective governing bodies. The Faculty Senate nominates Faculty, the Academic Staff Assembly no minates Academic Staff, and the Associated Students of Madison nominates students. Appointments to the panel vary in length of time and are typically 1 -3 years. The committee for a specific case is composed of at least three members with at least one student member. Committee members for all academic misconduct and non -academic misconduct are trained on various topics, including but not limited to UWS Chapters 17 and 18, the hearing outline, weighing information, assessing credibility, confidentiality, and recusal. Committees that hear cases regarding sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking are required to attend a sensitive -case training on an annual basis led by a forensic nurse. The training is trauma informed and covers victim response, sensitive interviewing of victims of sexual violence, consent, the role alcohol and other drugs can play in obtaining and giving consent, and the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. The Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards wil l take action to schedule the hearing, typically within 15 days of the completion of the Assistant Dean/Associate Director's receipt of the student -respondent's request for a hearing. The hearing itself is typically scheduled within 45 days of the completi on of the Assistant Dean/Associate Director's receipt of the student -respondent's request for a hearing. No less than 5 days before the hearing, the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards provides to the hearing committee, in writing, a full exp lanation of the facts upon which the determination of misconduct was based, and also provides the respondent and complainant with access to or copies of the investigating officer's and Assistant Dean/Associate Director's explanation, together with any othe r materials provided to the committee by the complainant and respondent. Information about the complainant or respondent's past disciplinary history, if any, will not be shared with the opposite party unless permitted by the Family Educational Rights and P rivacy Act (FERPA). In any hearing (whether by student request or automatically scheduled) the complainant and the respondent maintain the right to be accompanied by a support person, including the right to be advised by counsel at their own expense, the right to question witnesses, and the right to obtain a copy of the audio recording of the hearing. As per Chapter UWS 17.12(4)(b), at all times, the student respondent shall have the opportunity to hear and respond to the information presented against them and be afforded the opportunity to present questions to adverse witnesses, including the complainant if the complainant testifies at the hearing. Hearing procedures may be modified to allow the complainant to provide information in a manner that prevents a hostile environment. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, having the complainant and respondent pose questions to each other through their respective advisors or through the hearing committee. Witnesses may address a hearing committee and the hearing committee may limit the number of character witnesses permitted to address the committee. A support person is permitted to speak at the hearing only if the sanction recommended is suspension, expulsion, or if there is a concurrent criminal case. The committee determines, by 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 97 majority vote, whether or not the respondent is responsible for violating the code of conduct based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. Post -Hearing and Appeal If the complainant or student respondent want a w ritten transcript of the proceedings, they may have one prepared at their own expense. UW- Madison provides simultaneous notification, in writing, to both the complainant and respondent of the result of the disciplinary hearing, the procedures for appeal, any change in the result and when the results become final. Both the complainant and respondent may appeal in writing to the chancellor within 14 days of the date of the decision of the hearing committee. The appeal is based upon the record. The other p arty will be notified of the appeal by the chancellor's office. The chancellor or designee has 30 days from receipt of an appeal to respond and will uphold the decision unless the chancellor or designee finds any of the following: the information in the record does not support the findings or decision, appropriate procedures were not followed which resulted in material prejudice to the respondent or complainant, or the decision was based on factors proscribed by state or federal law. If the chancellor or designee finds one of those factors exist, the chancellor or designee may return the matter for consideration, or may invoke an appropriate remedy of their own. The decision will be communicated simultaneously to the respondent and the complainant. Decisions by the chancellor or designee are final, except that the Board of Regents may, at its discretion, grant a review upon the record, upon written request submitted by any party within 14 days of the final institutional decision. The non -appealing party will receive notice of the appeal. The Board of Regents, in its discretion, may consider an appeal based on the written record. The timeline for the resolution of the appeal to the Board of Regents is at the discretion of the Board of Regents. The appea l should be sent to the Office of the Board of Regents at: board@uwsa.org . Appealing parties should submit a written position statement that addresses the following: (1) whether the case involves substantial constituti onal claims, (2) whether there is a serious concern that the chancellor has abused his/her discretion or exceeded his/her authority, (3) whether the decision made at the institutional level could have system -wide implications, or (4) whether the final inst itutional decision is based upon facts not supported by the record, resulting in material prejudice to the individual seeking the review. If the Board grants review, the subcommittee may receive additional information for consideration, including oral pres entations, and then makes a recommendation to the full Board. Retaliation against a complainant or student respondent for exercising his or her rights under these procedures is prohibited and may be conduct subject to separate disciplinary action pursuant to Chapter UWS 17.09. A complainant or student respondent who has experienced retaliation should notify the investigating off icer, the Title IX Coordinator and/or the Dean of Students Office. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 98 RELEVANT EXCERPTS FROM UWS CHAPTER 17 The process described ab ove provides a summary of what people can expect from the student disciplinary process.

Chapters UWS 17 and 14 are available online: https://docs.legis.wisco nsin.gov/code/admin_code/uws/14 https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/uws/17 . UW- Madison has three major categories of employees: Faculty, Academic Staff and University Staff. Each of these categories of employees has distinct procedures for discipline and dismissal, which are provided below. In addition, UW -Madison has various type s of at -will employees, including limited appointees, teaching assistants (TA), project assistants (PA), postdoctoral trainees, other employees -in-training and student hourlies. All employees may be subject to one or more of the following disciplinary res ponses: written reprimand, unpaid suspension, dismissal, demotion, revocation of responsibilities, reassignment, and retraining. State administrative rules known as Chapter 4, Wis. Admin. Code (UWS), \"Procedures for Dismissal of Faculty,\" Chapter UWS 7, Wis. Admin. Code, \"Dismissal of Faculty in Special EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 103 Cases,\" and Chapter UWS 11, Wis. Admin. Code, \"Dismissal of Academic Staff for Cause\" apply to Faculty and Academic Staff, respectively. All University of Wisconsin System institutions develop individual procedures for discipline and dismissal based on the Wisconsin Administrative Code provisions mentioned above. At UW -Madison, the discipline and dismissal procedures for Faculty and Academic Staff members are developed through shared -governance process es. The discipline and dismissal procedures for University Staff employees are based upon standards developed under the State classified civil service requirements and currently remain in effect. Based on the changes to the Wisconsin Administrative Code, UW- Madison is in the process of updating its campus disciplinary and dismissal procedures. On November 16, 2018, the Department of Education released proposed Title IX regulations, which have not yet been finalized. Revised employee disciplinary and dism issal procedures will be published after the Department of Education releases the final Title IX regulations and the University consults with shared -governance bodies. The UW -Madison Policy on Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence requires that all employ ee disciplinary procedures are compliant with federal law. All employee disciplinary actions originating from a complaint of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking will include the following components on an ad hoc basis until the procedural updates are complete: Proceedings will be prompt, fair and impartial. Proceedings will be conducted by officials who receive, at minimum, annual training on issues related to sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking, and on how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of victims and promotes accountability. A hearing examiner's or committee's finding of misconduct will be based on a preponderance of the evidence standard. The c omplainant will have the same opportunity as the respondent to have others present during a disciplinary proceeding, including the opportunity to be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by the support person of their choice. UW- Madison will not limit the choice of support person or presence of support person for either the respondent or the complainant in any meeting or institutional disciplinary proceeding; however UW -Madison may establish restrictions regarding the extent to which the support person may participate in the proceedings that apply equally to both parties. The complainant and respondent will receive simultaneous notification of o The result of any institutional disciplinary proceeding that arises from an allegation of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and/or stalking. o UW- Madison's procedures for the complainant and respondent to appeal the result, if available. o Any change to the result. When the result becomes final. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 104 Proceedings will be completed with reasonably promp t timeframes and will include a process that allows for extension of the frames for good cause with written notice to the complainant and respondent of the delay and reason for delay. The complainant and respondent will be provided timely notice of any meeting at which the respondent or com plainant or both may be present. The complainant, respondent and appropriate officials will be provided timely and equal access to any information that will be used during informal and formal disciplinary meetings and hea rings. Proceedings will be conducted by officials who do not have a conflict of interest or bias for or against the complainant or respondent.

The function of legal counsel shall be to advise the committee, consult with them on legal matters, and such other responsibilities as shall be determined by the committee within the provisions of the rules and procedures adopted by the faculty of the institution in establishing the standing facul ty committee under s. UWS 4.03; g. (g) If a proceeding on charges against a faculty member not holding tenure is not concluded before the faculty member's appointment would expire, he/she may elect that such proceeding be carried to a final decision.

Nothing in this section shall prevent the settlement of cases by mutual agreement between the administration and the faculty member, with board approval, at any time prior to a final decision by the board; j. Adjournment shall be granted to enable the parties, including the complainant, to investigate evidence as to which a valid claim of surprise is made. UWS 4.07 Recommendations: to the Chancellor: to the Regents (1) The faculty hearing committee shall send to the chancellor and to th e faculty member concerned, as soon as practicable after conclusion of the hearing, a verbatim reco rd of the testimony and a copy of its report, findings, and recommendations. The committee may deter mine that while adequate cause for discipline exists, some sanction less severe than dismissal is more appropriate. Within 20 days after receipt of this material the chancellor shall review it and afford the faculty member an opportunity to discuss it. The chancellor shall prepare a written recommendatio n within 20 days following the meeting with the faculty member, unless his/her proposed recommendat ion differs substantially from that of the committee. If the chancellor's proposed recommendations differ substantially from those of the faculty hearing committee, the chancellor shall promptly consult the faculty hearing committee and provide the committee with a reasonable opportunity for a writte n response prior to forwarding his/her recommendation. If the recommendation is for dism issal, the recommendation shall be submitted through the president of the system to the board. A copy of t he faculty hearing 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 108 committee's report and recommendations shall be forwarded through the president of the system to the board along with the chancello r's recommendation. A copy of the chancell or's recommendation shall also be sent to the faculty member concerned and to the faculty commi ttee. For complaints involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complainant shall have all rights provided to the faculty member in this paragraph, includi ng the right to receive a copy of the chancellor's recommendation, except as may be precluded by applicable state or federal law. (2) Disciplinary action other than dism issal may be taken by the chancellor, after affording the faculty member an opportunity to be heard on the record, except that, upon written request by the faculty member, such action shall be submitted as a recommendation through the president to the boar d together with a copy of the faculty hearing committee's report and recommendation. For complaints involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complainant shall have all the rights provided to the facu lty member in this paragraph. UWS 4.08 Board Review (1) If the chancellor recommends dismissal, the board shall review the rec ord before the faculty hearing committee and provide an opportunity for filing exceptions to the recommendations of the hearing comm ittee or chancellor, and for oral arguments, unless the board decides to drop the charges against the faculty member without a hearing or the faculty member elects to waive a hearing. This hearing shall be closed unless the faculty member requests an open hearing (see su bch. V of ch. 19, Stats., Open Meeting Law). For complaints involving sexual harassment, sexual assa ult, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complainant shall have the same opportunit y for filing exceptions to the recommenda tions of the hearing committee or chancellor, and for oral arguments, as the faculty member.

UWS 4.09 Suspension from Duties Pending the final decision as to his/her dismissal, the faculty member shall not normally be relieved of duties; but if, after consultation with appropriate faculty committees the chancellor finds that substantial harm to the institution may result if the faculty member 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 109 is continued in his/her position, the faculty member may be relieved immediately of his/her duties, but his/her pay shall continue until the board makes its decision as to dismissal, unless the chancellor also makes the determinations set fo rth in s. UWS 7.06 (1) in which case the suspension from duties may be without pay and the procedures set forth in s. UWS 7.06 shall apply. UWS Chapter 7, Wis. Admin. Code, \"Dismissal of Faculty in Special Cases\" https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/uws/7 UWS 7.01 Declaration of Policy University faculty members are responsible for advancing the university's missions of teaching, research and public service. The fulfillment of these missions requires public trust in the integrity of the institution and in all members of the university community. The university's effectiveness, credibility, and ability to maintain public trust are undermined by criminal activity th at poses a substantial risk to the safety of others, that seriously impairs the university's ability to fulfill its missions, or that seriously impairs the faculty member's fitness or ability to fulfill his or her duties. Situations involving such serious criminal misconduct by faculty members must be addressed and resolved promptly to ensure that public trust is maintained and that the university is able to advance its missions. The Board of Regents therefore adopts the procedures in this chapter for ident ifying and responding to those instances in which a faculty member has engaged in serious criminal misconduct. UWS 7.02 Serious Criminal Misconduct (1) In this chapter, \"serio us criminal misconduct\" means: a. Pleading guilty or no contest to, or being convicted of a felony, in state or federal court, where one or more of the conditions in par. (b), (c), (d) or (e) are present, and the felony involves any of the following: i. Causing serious physical injury to another person. ii. Creating a serious danger to the per sona l safety of another person. iii. Sexual assault iv. Theft, fraud or embezzlement. v. Criminal damage to property. vi. Stalking or harassment. b. A substantial risk to the safety of members of the university community or others is posed. c. The university's ability, or the ability of the faculty member's colleagues, to fulfill teaching, research or public service missions is seriously impaired. d. The faculty member's fitness or ability to fulfill the duties of his or her position is seriously impaired. e. The opportunity of students to learn, do research, or engage in public service is seriously impaired. (2) Conduct, expressions, or beliefs which are constitutionally protected, or protected by the principles of academic freedom, shall not constitu te serious criminal misconduct. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 110 (3) Except as otherwise expressly provided, a faculty member who has engaged in serious criminal misconduct shall be subject to the procedures set forth in ss. UWS 7.03 to 7.06. (4) Any act required or permitted by ss. UWS 7.03 to 7.06 to be done by the chancellor may be de legated to the provost or another designee pursuant to institutional policies approved by the Board of Regents under s. UWS 2.02. UWS 7.03 Dismissal for Cause (1) Any faculty member having tenure may be dismissed only by the board and only for just cause and only after due notice and hearing. Any faculty member having a probationary appointment may be dismissed prior to the end of his or her term of appointment only by the board and only for just cause and onl y after due notice and hearing. (2) Just cause for dismissal includes, but is not limited to, serious criminal misconduct, as defined in s. UWS 7.02. UWS 7.04 Reporting Responsibility Any faculty member who is c harged with, pleads guilty or no contest to, or is convicted of a felony of a type listed in s.

Within 3 working days of receipt of the report or information, inform the faculty member of its receipt and, after consulting with appropriate institutional governance representatives, appoint an investigator to investigate the report or information and to advise the chancellor as to whether to proceed under this section or ch. UWS 4. In cases involving sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complainant shall be notified by the chancellor of the receipt of the report or information at the s ame time as the faculty member. b. (b) Upon appointing an investigator and notifying the faculty member, afford the faculty member 3 working days in which to request that the investigator be disqualified on grounds of lack of impartiality or other cause. In the event that the chancellor determines that a request for disqualification should be granted, the chancellor shall, within 2 working days of the determination, appoint a different investigator. The faculty member shall have the opportunity to request that any second or subsequent investigators be disqualified on grounds of lack of impartiality 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 111 or other cause. In cases involving sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the com plainant shall have the disqualification rights that are afforded to the faculty member in this subsection.

UWS 7.02 (1) (a), and one or more of the conditions listed in s. UWS 7.02 (1) (b) through (e) are present, the chancellor may, at that point, elect to fol low the procedures for dism issal pursuant to this chapter. c. If the chancellor decides to seek an alternative disciplinary sanction, the procedures under ch. UWS 6, and implementing institution al policies, shall be followed. (4) If charges seeking dismissal are filed under sub. (3) (a), the faculty member shall be afforded a hearing before the institutional standing committee charged with hearing dismissal cases and making recommendations under s. UWS 4.03. The hearing shall provide the procedural guarantees enum erated under ss. UWS 4.05 to 4.06, except that the hearing shall be concluded, and written findings and a recommendation to the chancellor shall be prepared, within 15 working days of the filing of charges. (5) a. Within 3 working days of receipt of the findings and recommendation of the committee under sub. (4), the chancellor shall prepare a writte n recommendation on the matter. b. If the recommendation is for dismissal, the chancellor shall trans mit it to the board for review. c. Disciplinary action other than dismissal may be taken by the chancellor, whose decision shall be final, unless the board at its option grants a review on the record at the request of the faculty member. The faculty member shall receive a copy of the chance llor's final decision. In cases involving sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complainant shall receive a copy of the chancellor's final decision at the same time as the 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 112 faculty member and shall have the same right to a rev iew on th e record as the faculty member.

(8) The administration or its representatives shall have the burden of proof to show that just cause exists for dismissal under this chapter. Th e administration must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the faculty member engaged in serious criminal misconduct, as defined in s. UWS 7.02, except in cases involving sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, in whic h the evidentiary standard shall be by a preponderance of the ev idence. (9) The chair of the faculty hearing body, subject to the approval of the chancellor, may extend the time limits set forth in this section if the parties are unable to obtain, in a timel y manner, relevant and material testimony, physical evidence or records, or where due process otherwise requires. UWS 7.06 Temporary Suspension Without Pay (1) The chancellor, after consulting with appropriate faculty governance representatives, may suspend a faculty member from duties without pay pending the final decision as to his or her dismissal where: a. The faculty member has been charged with a felony of a type listed in s. UWS 7.02 (1) (a) and the chancellor, after following the provisions of s. UWS 7.05 (1) through (3), finds, in addition, tha t there is a substantial likelihood 1) that one or more of the conditions listed in s. UWS 7.02 (1) (b) through (e) are present, and 2) that the faculty member has engage d in the conduct as alleged; or b. The faculty me mber is unable to report for work due to incarceration, conditions of bail or similar cause; or c. The faculty member has pleaded guilty or no contest to or been convicted of a felony of a type listed in s. UWS 7.02 (1) (a) and one or more of the conditions listed in s.

The chancellor's decision to suspend without pay under this secti on shall be final, except that: a. If the chancellor later determines th at the faculty member should not be dismissed, the chancellor may discontinue the proceedings, or may recommend a lesser penalty to the board, and, except as provided in par. (c), shall order the payment of back pay for any period of the suspension for which the faculty member was willing and able to report for work. b.

If the chancellor or board later determines, under par. (a) or (b), to recommend or impose as a lesser penalty the suspension of the faculty member without pay, then any period of suspension without pay so recommended or ordered shall be offset by the period of any suspension without pay actually served by the faculty member. (4) If, after affording the faculty member the opportunity to be heard, the chancellor determines that the conditions in s ub. (1) are not present or that a suspension without pay is otherwise not warranted, the provisions of s. UWS 4.09 shall apply. FPP Chapter 9: Discipline and Dismissal of Faculty for Cause Faculty Policies and Procedures (FPP) can also be found at: https://secfac.wisc.edu/governance/faculty -legislation/fpp_ch_9/ UWS 9.02 Cause for Discipline No faculty member shall be subject to discipline except for just cause, based upon a determination that the faculty member has violated a university rule or policy or has engaged in conduct which adversely affects the faculty member's performance of his/her responsibilities to the university but which is not serious enough to warran t dismissal. As used in this chapter, discipline means any sanction except dismissal imposed by the administration against a faculty member for misconduct, including but not limited to an official reprimand, reduction in salary or reduction of a department ally recommended increase in salary, or reduction in rank. UWS 9.03 Cause for Dismissal ( see UWS 4.01.) No faculty member shall be subject to dismissal except for just cause, based upon a determination that the faculty member's conduct directly and substantially affects adversely, to a degree greater than that reserved for disciplinary action, the ability to carry out satisfactorily his/her responsibilities to the university. Examples of conduct that may warrant dismissal include, but are not limited to, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of facts for personal benefit, gross abuse of authority or influence (e.g., discriminatory or retaliatory actions, particularly where a pattern is evident), or willful and protracted violations of university rules or policies. Layoff and termination for reasons of financial 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 114 emergency are not dismissals for cause, and such actions are taken pursuant to Chapter 10 of these rules. UWS 9.04 Complaints About Faculty Members Complaints against faculty members alleging fact s which, if true, might constitute adequate cause for discipline under UWS 6 or dismissal under UWS 4 shall be in writing and shall be filed with the vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost. UWS 9.05 Action by Provost on Complaints A. On receiving a complaint concerning a faculty member, the provost shall determine whether the complaint deals with scholarly misconduct and/or other misconduct. B. Complaints alleging scholarly misconduct shall be dealt with according to Faculty Document 867a and FPP 9.14 . A formal allegation of misconduct in scholarly research will be referred to the chair of the department (or functional equivalent) or to the corresponding academic dean or, in the case of conflict of interest on the part of the chair or academic dean, to the Vice Chancel lor of Research and Graduate Education. C. If the complaint alleges misconduct other than scholarly misconduct, the provost shall determine whether a prima facie case exists for the imposition of discipline or for dismissal. The provost shall also consider the timeliness of the complaint, particularly in light of related state and federal limitations statutes. As used in this section, a prima facie case for discipline exists whenever the information submitted in support of the complaint would warrant disciplinary action, if considered on its face to be true and not subject to refutation or exculpatory explanation. A prima facie case for dismissal exists whenever this standard is met, but with the additional requirement that the information subm itted in support of the complaint be of such substantial character that the magnitude of the alleged conduct warrants contemplation of dismissal if determined to be true. If a prima facie case does not exist or if the complaint is not considered timely, th e complaint shall be dismissed. D. Whenever the provost receives a complaint against a faculty member which he/she deems substantial and which, if true, might lead to dismissal under UWS 4, the provost shall proceed under UWS 4 and the provisions of this chap ter of FPP. UWS 9.06 Investigation and Further Action A. If the provost determines that a prima facie case exists for imposition of discipline or dismissal and the case is timely, he/she shall institute an investigation by appointing an investigator or inve stigators of his/her choosing. The provost shall also offer to discuss the matter with the faculty member concerned, giving the faculty member an opportunity to speak to the matter, and shall provide the faculty member with a written statement of the matte r(s) to be investigated. The faculty member shall also receive a copy of the original signed complaint, subject to the 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 115 possible need to redact information pertaining to third parties that will not be considered part of the investigation. The faculty member concerned shall have the right to be advised and represented by counsel or other representative at his/her expense throughout the investigation and thereafter. B. The faculty member can state objection s to the provost's selection of investigator(s). The investigator(s) shall investigate the complaint as soon as practicable and provide an oral and/or written report to the provost. Following the investigation the provost shall consult with recent past chairs of the University Committee and the Committee on Fac ulty Rights and Responsibilities who shall advise the provost as to the actions that should be taken as enumerated in C. below. C. Actions that the provost may take are: 1. Dismiss the case; or 2. Refer the complaint to the department(s) or the equivalent functional unit(s) in which the faculty member concerned holds membership if the investigation indicates that the case involves a matter which should be resolved at the departmental level and in which disciplinary action by the provost is not warranted; or 3. Prepare to invoke an appropriate disciplinary action. In doing so, the provost will present the faculty member with a written summary of all evidence obtained both for and against each charge brought forward for disciplinary action or dismissal. The provost shall then invite the faculty member to participate in voluntary and confidential settlement negotiations which could involve, with agreement of both parties, formal mediation. If formal mediation is invoked, the parties shall agree on the appointm ent o f a mediator or mediators. Formal mediation must be completed within 30 days of the appointment of the mediator(s), unless both parties agree to an extension of no more than 30 days. At any time, either party may withdraw from the mediation process. 4. If set tlement is not achieved by negotiation or mediation, invoke appro priate discipline or dismissal. When the provost invokes either discipline or dismissal, he/she shall provide the faculty member with a copy of any investigatory report produced and a copy of any written recommendation as provided above. The provost shall al so inform the faculty member of his/her right to appeal to the Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities (CFRR). UWS 9.07 Committee on Faculty Rights and Responsibilities. A. When a faculty member appeals a disciplinary action to the committee, the committee shall: 1. Conduct fact -finding hearings if requested by the faculty member or by the provost or if deemed necessary by the committee; 2. Make recommendations to the chancellor concernin g the validity of the appeal. B. When a faculty member appeals dismissal, the committee shall under UWS 4.03 serve as the standing committee to hear and act on the case, except for cases involving allegations of misconduct in scholarly research in which the H earing 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 116 Committee on Misconduct in Scholarly Research shall be the standing committee, under Faculty Document 867a. UWS 9.08 CFRR Hearings When CFRR is holding a fact -finding hearing in a discipline case or is acting as a hearing body in a dismissal case, it shall operate as provided in UWS 4.05 and 4.06. Additionally, the faculty member shall have a right to: A. service of notice of hearing with specific charges in writing at least twenty days prior to the hearing; B. notification of the name(s) of the complai nant(s); C. be heard by all bodies passing judgment or making recommendations; D. refrain from testifying without such omission being used as formal evidence of guilt; and E. a stenographic record of all hearings and transcripts thereof at no cost to him/her. UWS 9.09 Findings by CFRR A. A finding of just cause for the imposition of discipline or just cause for di smissal must be based on clear and convincing evidence in the hearing recor d. B. A finding by the committee of just cause for discipline or just cause for dism issal requires a majority vote with not more than two dissenting votes. Otherwise, the committee shall report that just cause for discipline or just cause for dismissal has not been established. The vote shall be reported in every case. UWS 9.10 Suspensio n The faculty committee to be consulted by the chancellor in considering suspension under UWS 4.09 is the University Committee. UWS 9.11 Transmittal of CFRR Findings in Discipline Cases A. CFRR shall transmit its findings of fact and recommendations in dis cipline cases in writing to the chancellor, with copies to the provost, to the faculty member involved, and to the complainant within ten days of the conclusion of its proceedings. B. Within ten days of the transmittal of the committee's findings and recommen dations to the chancellor, the faculty member concerned or the original complainant may file written objections with the chancellor. C. The chancellor shall, as soon as practicable after the expiration of this ten -day period, render his/her decision and trans mit such decision to the committee, the provost, the faculty member concerned, the original complainant, and the University Committee. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 117 UWS 9.12 CFRR Transmittal of Findings in Dismissal Cases CFRR shall transmit its findings of fact and recommendations in dismissal cases in accordance with UWS 4.07. UWS 9.13 No Further Jeopardy Following recommendations of CFRR and a decision by the chancellor, or following action by the provost if the committee is not involved, the faculty member concerned shall not be subject again under these rules to the same charges arising from the original complaint.

After reviewing the matter on record and considering arguments if subm itted by the parties, the chancellor shall issue a decision. In that decision, the chancellor may order dismissal of the academic staff member, may impose a lesser disciplinary action, or may find in favor of the academic staff member. The academic staff m ember shall be notified of the chancellor's decision in writing. In cases involving sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complainant shall be notified of the chancellor's decision at the same time as the academic staff membe r. This decision shall be deemed final unless the board, upon request of the academic staff member, grants review based on the record. For complaints involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complain ant shall have all rights provided to the academic staff member in this paragraph. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 121 UWS 11.08 Suspension From Duties Pending the final decision as to dismissal, the academic staff member with an indefinite appointment shall not be relieved of duties, ex cept where, after consulting with the appropriate administrative officer, the chancellor finds that substantial harm may result if the staff member is continued in his or her position.

UWS 11.105 (1) in which case the suspension from duties may be without pay and the procedures set forth in s. UWS 11.105 shall apply. UWS 11.09 Date of Dismissal A decision by the chancellor ordering dismissal shall specify the effective date of the dismissal. UWS 11.10 Board Review A member of the academic staff on indefinite appointment who has been dismissed for cause by the chancellor following a hearing may appeal this action to the board.

UWS 11.105 Temporary Suspension Of Duties Without Pay (1) The chancellor, after consulting with appropriate academic staff governance representatives, may suspend an academic staff member holding an indefinite appointment from duties without pay pending the final decision as to his or her dismissal where: a. The academic staff member has been charged with a felony of a type listed in s. UWS 11.102 (1) (a) and the chancellor, after following the provisions of s. UWS 11.104 (1) through (3), finds, in addition,that there is a substantial likelihood 1) that one or more of the conditions listed in s. UWS 11.102 (1) (b) through (e) are present, and 2) that the academic staff member has engaged in the conduct as alleged; or b. The academic staff member is unable to report for work due to incarceration, conditions of bail or si milar cause; or c. The academic staff member has pleaded guilty or no contest to or been convicted of a felony of the type listed in s. UWS 11.102 (1) (a) and one or more of the conditions in s.

The academic staff member may be represented by coun sel or another at this meeting. (3) a. If, after affording the academic staff member the opportunity to be heard, the chancellor determines to suspend without pay, th e chancellor shall inform the academic staff member of the suspension, in writing. The 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 125 chancellor's decision to suspend without pay under this secti on shall be final, except that: b. If the chancellor later determines that the academic staff memb er should not be dismissed the chancellor may discontinue the proceedings, or may impose a lesser penalty, and except as provided in par. (c), shall order the payment of back pay for any period of the suspension for which the academic staff member was willing and able to report for work; c. If the chancellor later determines, under par. (a) or (b), to recommend or impose as a lesser penalty the suspension of the academic staff member without pay, then any period of suspension without pay so recommended or ordered shall be offset by the period of any suspension without pay actually served by the academic staff member. (4) If, after affording the academic staff member the opportunity to be heard, the chancellor determines that the conditions in sub. (1) are not present or that a suspension without pay is otherwise not warranted, the provisions of s. UWS 11.08 shall apply. UWS 11. 106 Board Review A member of the academic staff on an indefinite appointment who has been dismissed for serious criminal misconduct may appeal this act ion to the board as provided in s. UWS 11.10. UWS 11.11 Dismissal For Cause - Fixed Term or Probationary Academic Staff Appointments A member of the academic staff holding a probationary appointment, or a member of the academic staff holding a fixed term appointment and having completed an initial specified period of time, may be dismissed prior to the end of the contract term only for just cause or for reasons of budget or program under ch. UWS 12. A nonrenewal of such an appointment is not a dismissal u nder this section. A dismissal shall not become effective until the individual concerned has received a written notification of specific charges and has been offered an opportunity for a hearing before the appropriate dean or director or his/her designee. If such hearing is requested, a determination of just cause and notification of dismissal shall be made by the dean or director or designee. If no hearing is requested the dismissal is effected by the specifications in the original notification of charges. The hearing before the dean, director, or designee shall provide the academic staff member with an opportunity to present evidence and argument concerning the allegations. Dismissal shall be effective immediately on receipt of written notification of the decision of the dean or director or designee unless a different dismissal date is specified by the dean or director. Dismissals for cause shall be appealable by filing an appeal with the hearing body established under s. UWS 11.03. The burden of proof as to the existence of just cause on appeal shall be on the administration or the authorized official. The provisions of s. UWS 11.04, procedural guarantees, contained in ss. UWS 11.05 and 11.06 and the review provisions of s. UWS 11.07, shall be applicable to the appeal proceeding. In no event, however, shall a decision favorable to the appellant extend the term of the original appointment. If a proceeding on appeal is not concluded before the appointment expiration date, the academic staff member concerned ma y elect that such 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 126 proceeding be carried to a final decision. Unless such election is made in writing, the proceeding shall be discontinued at the expiration of the appointment. If the chancellor ultimately decides in favor of the appellant, salary lost dur ing the interim period between the effective date of dismissal and the date of the chancellor's decision or the end of the contract period, whichever is earlier, shall be restored. In those cases where the immediate supervisor of the academic staff member concerned is a dean or director, the chancellor shall, to avoid potential prejudice, designate an appropriate administrative officer to act for the dean or director under this section. For complaints involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating vio lence, domestic violence, or stalking, the complainant shall have all procedural rights provided to the academic staff member in this section and the standard of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. UWS 11.12 Dismissal For Cause - Teaching M embers of the Academic Staff The policies and procedures of each institution may provide that dismissal for cause of a member of the academic staff having teaching responsibilities and holding a probationary appointment or a fixed term appointment may pr oceed under ss. UWS 11.02 to 11.10. If the institutional policies and procedures do not specifically make such provisions, dismissal for cause shall be made pursuant to s. UWS 11.11. ASPP Chapter 6: Discipline an d Dismissal Academic Staff Policy and Procedures (ASPP) can also be found at: http://acstaff.wisc.edu/policy_documents/ASPP -Chapter -6.pdf This chapter describes policies and procedures for discipline and dismissal to be used in cases of unsatisfactory performance or misconduct. Just -cause standards (see 6.03.3.b) apply to all disciplinary actions involving loss of pay and dismissal actions taken under the provisions of this chapter. Lapses in performance or misconduct do not necessarily lead to discipline or dismissal. If performance reviews, counseling, or other communication between the employer and the employee alleviate the problem to the employer's satisfaction, there is no necessity t o proceed to formal sanctions. However, if lapses in performance or misconduct continue, discipline or dismissal shall be considered. In egregious situations, the employer may proceed directly to discipline or dismissal. 6.01 Grounds For Discipline and Di smissal A. Unsatisfactory Performance. An academic staff employee shall be subject to discipline or dismissal for unsatisfactory performance... B. Misconduct. An academic staff employee who has violated a university rule or policy or has engaged in conduct that adversely affects the staff member's performance of his or her obligations to the university shall be subject to discipline or dismissal for misconduct. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 127 6.02 Discipline A. Definition. Discipline refers to any sanction short of dismissal imposed by the univ ersity against an academic staff member for unsatisfactory performance or misconduct, including but not limited to a letter specifically identified as a reprimand, reduction in salary, change of appointment status, or suspension without pay. Performance re views, letters of counseling, administrative leave with pay,merit pay determinations, and the like are not considered discipline and should normally precede any disciplinary actions by an employer, unless the unsatisfactory performance or misconduct is egr egious or intolerable in the workplace. B. Disciplinary Procedures 1. Investigation. Prior to taking disciplinary action, the employer shall conduct an investigation to determine whether the allegations of inappropriate performance or conduct have substance. The length and scope of the investigation shall be at the discretion of the employer. The employer may place the employee on administrative leave with pay during the investigation. Just -cause standards apply (see 6.03.3.b) for disciplinary actions involving l oss of pay. The employer may meet with the employee to ask questions about the allegations as part of the investigation. If the employer concludes that there is no basis for disciplinary action, the employer shall inform the employee immediately. 2. Predisciplinary Meeting. If, after the investigation, the employer believes that grounds for discipline may exist, the employer shall meet with the employee. Prior to the meeting the employer shall provide the employee with notice in writing of the grounds for possible discipline, the range of discipline being considered, the time and place of the predisciplinary meeting, and the employee's right to respond to the allegations and possible disciplinary sanction at the meeting. After taking into account the e mployee's response at the predisciplinary meeting, the employer will determine whether to proceed with disciplinary action. The employer may conclude (1) that discipline is warranted, (2) that discipline is not warranted, or (3) that further investigation is required in which case, another predisciplinary meeting must be held after completing the additional investigation if the employer believes discipline is appropriate. 3. Notification of Disciplinary Action. When the employer determines that discipline is a ppropriate, the employer, upon approval by the dean, director, or designee, shall inform the employee in writing. This notification shall clearly state that it is a letter of discipline, shall include a description of the employee's unsatisfactory performa nce or misconduct, shall state what discipline is imposed, shall inform the employee of his or her appeal rights, and shall include a copy of ASPP 6, 7, and 9. C. Appeal Process for Disciplinary Actions. Disciplinary actions may be grieved using the procedure described in ASPP 7. The Academic Staff Appeals Committee shall use the tests provided in 6.03.3.b to determine whether just -cause exists in cases of disciplinary action involving loss of pay. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 128 6.03 Dismissal A. Dismissal for Cause of Academic Staff with Fixed Term and Probation ary Appointments (see also UWS 11.11 and 11.12) 1. Grounds for Dismissal. No academic staff member shall be subject to dismissal except for just -cause based upon a determination of either unsatisfactory performance or misconduct (see 6 .01.1 and 6.01.2). Layoffs (ASPP 5) and nonrenewals (ASPP 3) are not dismissals for cause. 2. Investigation. The employer shall conduct an investigation to determine whether allegations of unsatisfactory performance or misconduct have substance. The length an d scope of the investigation shall be at the discretion of the employer. The employer may place the employee on administrative leave with pay during the investigation. Just -cause standards apply (see 6.03.3.b). The employer may meet with the employee to as k questions about the allegations as part of the investigation. If the employer concludes that there is no basis for dismissal, the empl oyer shall inform the employee immediately. 3. Predismissal Meeting. If, after the investigation, the employer believes tha t grounds for dismissal may exist, the employer shall meet with the employee. Prior to the meeting the employer shall provide the employee with notice in writing of the grounds for possible dismissal, the time and place of the predismissal meeting, and the employee's right to respond to the allegations and level of disciplinary sanction at the meeting. After taking into account the employee's response at the predismissal meeting, the employer will determine whether to proceed with dismissal. The employer ma y conclude (1) that dismissal is warranted ; (2) that dismissal is not warranted, but a disciplinary action is ; (3) that neither dismissal nor discipline is warranted; or (4) that further investigation is required, in which case another predismissal or pred isciplinary meeting must be held after completing the additional investigation if the employer believes grounds exist for either dismissal or discipline. 4. Notification. When the employer decides dismissal is necessary, he or she must obtain approval of the dean, director, or designee to proceed with the dismissal. If the dean, director, or designee approves the dismissal, the academic staff member shall be notified in writing of the effective date of the dismissal, with a copy to the department chair or unit head and the Secretary of the Academic Staff, 270 Bascom Hall. This notification shall include a statement of the grounds for dismissal, inform the employee that he or she has the right to request a review by the dean, director, or designee, and include a copy of ASPP 6 and 9. Notification shall be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If service cannot be made within 15 working days, service shall be accomplished by first class mail and by publication as if the statement of cha rges were a summons and the provisions of section 262.06(1)(c), Wis. Stats., were applicable. Dismissal may occur only after the academic staff member has received written notification. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 129 5. Review by Dean or Director. Upon receipt of dismissal notification the employee shall have 20 working days to submit a written request to the dean or director for a review, including a summary of the facts and circumstances concerning the allegations. The academic staff member shall have the opportunity to make a personal pr esentation to the dean, d irector, or designee. The dean, director, or designee shall make a determination of just cause for dismissal and notify the employee of the decision in writing within 15 working days after the receipt of the request for a review or 15 working days after the personal presentation, whichever is later. If the dismissal is upheld by the dean, director, or designee, the notification shall inform the employee of his or her right to appeal to the Academic Staff Appeals Committee under 6.03 .3. If there is no response by the dean or director to the written request for a review within the designated time period, the employee may appeal to the Academic Staff Appeals Committee within 20 working days of the expiration of the designated period. 6. Effective Date of Dismissal. If the academic staff member does not submit a request for a review by the dean or director within 20 working days, the dismissal shall be effective on the date specified in the original notification letter with no further appeal rights. If the academic staff member submits a request for review within 20 working days and the dismissal is upheld, the dean, director, or designee shall determine the effective date of dismissal and inform the employee in writing of the date. 7. Time Limi ts. Steps in the appeal process must be initiated and completed within the designated time periods except when modified by mutual consent. If the employee fails to initiate the next step in the appeal process within the designated time period, the appeal w ill be considered resolved by the decision at the last completed step. 8. Suspension of Duties. The dean, direc tor, or designee may suspend academic staff member with a fixed term or probationary appointment with or without pay even if the review is in proces s. B. Dismissal for Cause of Academic Staff with Indefinite Appointments (see also UWS 11.01- 11.10) 1. Grounds for Dismissal. No academic staff member holding an indefinite appointment shall be subject to dismissal except for just cause, based upon a determinati on that the academic staff member's conduct or performance directly and substantially affects adversely the ability to carry out satisfactorily his or her responsibilities to the university. Layoff (ASPP 5) is not dismissal for cause. In contrast to the pr ocedure for fixed term academic staff in 6.03.1, only the chancellor, in consultation with the appropriate dean or director, has the authority to begin the dismissal process. 2. Investigation. When the chancellor receives an allegation concerning an academic staff member holding an indefinite appointment which appears to be substa ntial and which, if true, might lead to dismissal, an investigation shall be conducted within a reasonable time by the appropriate dean or director or other chancellor's designee. The employer may place the employee on administrative leave with pay during the investigation. Prior to initiating a dismissal, the dean or director, in consultation with the 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 130 chancellor, shall investigate the allegation, offer to discuss it informally with the individual, and provide information of rights to which members of the academic staff are entitled under this chapter and UWS 11. Just -cause standards apply (see 6.03.3.b). In those cases where the immediate supervisor of the academic staff member concern ed is a dean or director, the chancellor shall, to avoid potential prejudice, designate an appropriate administrative officer to act for the dean or director under this section. 3. Predismissal Meeting. If, after the investigation, the dean or director believ es that grounds for dismissal exist, the dean or director shall provide the employee with a written statement of the specific charges, the possibility of dismissal, the time and place of the predismissal meeting, and the employee's opportunity to respond t o the allegations and possible disciplinary sanction at the meeting. After taking into account the employee's response at the predismissal meeting, the dean or director will determine whether to proceed with dismissal. The dean or director may conclude (1) that dismissal is warranted; (2) that dismissal is not warranted, but a disciplinary action is ; (3) that neither dismissal nor discipline is warranted ; or (4) that further investigation is required, in which case another predismissal or predisciplinary meeting must be held after completing the additional investigation if the dean or director believes grounds exist for either dismissal or discipline. Notification. When the dean or director decides dismissal is warrant ed, he or she shall notify the academic staff member in writing of the effective date of the dismissal with a copy to the department chair or unit head, the Academic Personnel Office Se cretary of the Academic Staff, and the chancellor. The notification shall include a statement of the grounds for dismissal, inform the employee that he or she has 20 working days in which t o request a hearing before the Academic Staff Appeals Committee, and include copies of ASPP 6 and 9. Notification shall be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If service cannot be made within 15 working days, service shall be accomplished by first - class mai l and by publication as if the statement of charges were a summons and the provisions of sect ion 262.06(1)(c), Wis. Stats. were applicable. Dismiss al may occur only after the academic staff member has received written notification. 4. Effective Date of Dismissal. If the academic staff member does not submit a timely appeal under 6.03.3.a, the dismissal shall be effective on the date specified in the original notification letter with no further right of appeal. If the academic staff member submits a timely appeal and the dismissal is upheld, the effective date of the dismissal will be determined by the chancellor and shall be stated in his or her decision . 5.

UNIVERSITY STAFF In 2015, the University of Wisconsin transitioned those employees termed Classified Personnel to a new employee category: University Staff. The University is in the proces s of editing all policies and procedures to reflect this new designation. Disciplinary procedures now in place that refer to Classified Personnel are applicable to those employees now serving as University Staff. UW- Madison will review provisions of the U niversity Staff employee disciplinary procedures and make modifications to relevant policies to ensure that they are compliant with federal law. CPPP Chapter 18: Discipline, Including Dismissal Classified Personnel Policies and Procedures (CPPP) can be found by clicking here . 18.01 Corrective Progressive Discipline Policy It is expected that managers and supervisors wil l use multiple strategies to establish a climate in which employees willingly follow established policies and procedures. Such strategies may include clear communication, feedback and leading by example. When such actions are not successful, additional str ategies may be necessary. One such strategy 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 133 is corrective progressive discipline. Corrective discipline principles, described below, apply to all permanent classified employees. Definition Progressive discipline is a formal process to give employees opportunities to correct unacceptable behavior that violates the University of Wisconsin Classified Employees Work Rules. Progressive discipline is the application of increasingly serious consequences for repeated failure to change behavior that violates o ne of the work rules. Classified employees may be disciplined for violation of Work Rules for Classified Employees if there is just cause (see section titled Just Cause Checklist). Contact your employing unit personnel representative to find out who is au thorized in your work unit to conduct investigations, pre -disciplinary meetings and make the final decision to discipline. The rest of this section describes the steps of the procedure. Investigation When the employer becomes aware that a work rule or pol icy/procedure related to a work rule may have been violated, it is necessary to gather information. Pertinent written information, such as applicable policies, records and/or written communications, should be collected. Who was involved, when, where, and any extenuating circumstances, as well as any witnesses, should be identified. It may be necessary to conduct investigatory meetings with witnesses and the employee(s) who allegedly violated the rules to obtain information. Classified employees may have a representative of their own choosing present at an investigatory meeting. If the representative is a campus employee, they may attend the investigatory meeting without loss of pay if the meeting occurs during the representative's normally scheduled work h ours. The representative must follow leave scheduling protocol for the scheduling of absences for this purpose. Investigatory meetings will be scheduled to accommodate the attendance of the personal representative, however, this will not involve the unreas onable delay of the meeting. Prior to the meeting, campus employees will be provided with a reasonable amount of time to meet with the representative in order to prepare for the meeting. Notes should be taken by management to record the information learned at any interviews and kept with other factual records that are being considered while management decides whether or not a work rule infraction occurred. It is recommended that any witnesses date and sign any pertinent statements attesting that the writte n information accurately reflects the information they have provided. If, after review of the record which resulted from the investigation, it is tentatively determined that there is just cause for discipline (see section titled Just Cause Checklist), a pre-disciplinary meeting is scheduled to give the employee an opportunity to respond. Classified employees may have a representative of their own choosing present at the pre-disciplinary meeting. If the representative is a campus employee, they may attend t he pre - disciplinary meeting without loss of pay if the meeting occurs during the representative's normally scheduled work hours. The representative must follow leave scheduling protocol 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 134 for the scheduling of absences for this purpose. Pre- disciplinary meet ings will be scheduled to accommodate the attendance of the personal representative, however, this will not involve the unreasonable delay of the meeting. Prior to the meeting, campus employees will be provided with a reasonable amount of time to meet with the representative in order to prepare for the meeting. Typically, at the pre -disciplinary meeting, management gives a verbal summary of the reasons management has tentatively decided to take disciplinary action. The employee and representative may then present additional information, refute the facts, explain mitigating circumstances, etc. Further investigation may be necessary before a final decision is made if new information is obtained. If no new information is obtained, management proceeds to self -check to see if there is just cause for the discipline. If the answer is yes, a letter of discipline is issued. Prior to using these steps the employee must have received notice of possible consequences for improper conduct. This could be accomplished verb ally, in writing or by receiving a copy of the Classified Employee work rules. Non -exempt Employees - Typically the progression is: written reprimand, progressively increasing suspensions without pay (one -day, three -day, five -day), discharge. FLSA exe mpt employees - Due to a court ruling, employees who are subject to disciplinary suspensions without pay for periods of less than a full work week (that is, five work days) must be considered to be \"non -exempt\" employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and therefore must be paid premium pay (time and one -half) for overtime hours worked. Because of this ruling, classified employees who are \"exempt\" should not be docked pay for less than five days. Five -day suspensions must be in consecutive five- day blocks and must coincide with the employee's work week. If a one- or three -day suspension is merited, the letter should state something similar to: \"Although we believe your conduct would merit a [one - or three -day] suspension without pay, this [second o r third] letter of reprimand is being issued instead of a [one- or three - day] suspension in order to maintain the FLSA exempt status of your position. However, you are advised that any future violations of the work rules may result in a full work -week susp ension without pay or other discipline up to and including discharge.\" After the decision is made to take disciplinary action, the employee must be notified in writing. The letter of discipline must include the following: The type of action to be taken (e.g. This is a letter of reprimand or This is a letter of suspension.) and, if a suspension is identified, state the date(s) the employee is suspended and the date s/he is expected to return to work. Just Cause Checklist The Just Cause checklist is used to review whether disciplinary action is appropriate in coordination with an investigation and/or pre -disciplinary meeting. The checklist is used to determine whether the employee is responsible for the allegation, and if s o, whether corrective action is an appropriate consequence for the alleged infraction. The checklist 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 135 also helps guide the institution's response if the decision is appealed, as the guidelines are an important factor for the WERC (Wisconsin Employment Relat ions Commission) and other appeals bodies to use to assess whether the corrective action taken by the University was appropriate. 1. Did the employer give the employee warning about the possible discipline? The employee must have been forewarned that the parti cular behavior would result in discipline. This may have occurred verbally, or by mean s of a policy which stated the consequences of noncompliance or the Work Rules for Classified Employees. 2. Was the employer's order or rule related to the safe and ef ficient operation of the work unit or institution? The broken rule or disobeyed directive must be reasonably related to the University's mission or business. 3. Did an investigation take place to find out if the employee actually violated the order or rule, and if so, the reasons for it? Refer to the Investigation section above. 4. Was the employer's in vestigation fair and objective? The employer should interview all witnesses and consider all available information not just information that supports the discipline. In case of conflicting accounts, the employer may have to m ake credibility determinations. 5. Was substantial evidence present to establish that a violation took place? The evidence cannot be mere ru mor or unsupported accusations. 6. Did the em ploy er apply its rules equally? If it appears that other similarly situated employees have been treated differently, the employer must be able to provide reasonable explanations for what appears to be unequal treatment. 7. Was the penalty reasonable? The degree of discipline must be related to the seriousness of the offense and to the employee's record of progressive discipline. Typically, the employer's failure to take corrective discipline earlier will not be viewed by an arbitrator as justification for skippi ng a disciplinary step and taking more severe discipline. Grievances /Appeals University Staff employees may file grievances through the grievance process outlined in HR policies. This is a four -step process. The first step is in the employing unit. The second step is the Office of Human Resources. The third step is at the Impartial Hearing Panel/Campus Hearing Officer or (for employees hired prior to July 1, 2015) Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission. The next step, in cases of dismissal which have been 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 136 appealed to the Impartial Hearing Panel/Campus Hearing Officer is the Chancellor or designee. Finally, the employee may appeal the Chancellor's or designee's decision to the Board of Regents. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 137 STATE OF WISCONSIN CRIME STATUTES & DEFINITIONS The Clery Act and the Violence Against Women Act mandate that UW -Madison provide domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking definitions applicable in its jurisdiction.

Portable Electric Appliances University Apartments does not restrict or hav e policy information relating to portable electric appliances other than restricting the use of portable dishwashers. The Fire Safety Section of the University Apartments Resident Handbook contains the following information about Fire Safety: 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 187 Fire Alarms In any large apartment community, there are occasional false fire alarms. But there are also real fires, often starting in kitchens. NOTE: When you hear a fire alarm, always vacate your apartment. In University Apartments, there are several different ty pes of fire alarm systems. All building fire alarm systems in Eagle Heights and University Houses report directly to UWPD, who will then contact the fire department. Presently, the alarms at Harvey Street do not report automatically to the fire department or to UWPD; residents must call 911 when an alarm goes off. \"Pull Stations\" to Activate Fire Alarms Residents must activate a fire alarm pull station inside their apartment or in the common stairwell to activate the building fire alarm system. In University Houses, the pull stations are found in basements where resident storage is located in buildings 5, 10, 21, 30, 35 and 39. In the event of a fire, first notify your neighbors and the fire department by activating the nearest pull station, then c all 911. There is no charge for calling the fire department. If time allows, contact the Apartment Facilities Office: (608) 262 -2037 (M -F 7:00 AM - 3:30 PM) or text the after -hours Resident Manager on Duty: (608) 444 -9308. Smoke Detectors There are active smoke detectors in each apartment throughout University Apartments. These only sound a local alarm; they are not linked to the UWPD or fire department. The smoke detectors are \"hard wired\" into the electrical system with battery back -up. Sometimes people a re tempted to disconnect their smoke detectors so they do not sound during cooking. This is a serious lease violation. You will be held responsible for payment of fire damages to buildings and their contents if investigation following a fire reveals an apartment smoke detector did not function due to negligence on your part (removal of the smoke detector, or failure to replace a weak or missing battery), or if the fire was caused by you. A charge may be made for fixing non -operating detectors if found durin g normal maintenance calls. If the detector goes off by mistake and you temporarily remove the battery, be sure to replace it. \"Beeping\" Smoke Detectors If the alarm beeps every minute, it means the battery needs to be replaced. Free smoke detector batte ries are available at the University Apartments Office or Apartment Facilities Office. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 188 Carbon Monoxide Detectors If the alarm is constant, you should leave the apartment and contact the Apartment Facilities Office or the Resident Manager on Duty. If it is \"chirping\" or beeping every few seconds, that means it is time to change the batteries. You can get new batteries from the University Apartments Office or from the Resident Manager on Duty. Fire Extinguishers Tampering with a fire extinguisher is a crime. If you observe someone tampering with an extinguisher, notify the UWPD immediately. Also, notify the Apartment Facilities Office so that the extinguisher can be checked to ensure it is in working order. Make sure everyone in your household knows the location of the fire extinguishers in your building. Kitchen Fires Kitchen fires usually occur because someone put something on the stove to cook, and then became involved in another activity or left the apartment. Another frequent cause of fire is grease build -up in the kitchen. NEVER leave a stove unattended if it is in use. Keep the stove, kitchen walls, and all areas near the stove free of grease. In the event of a stove fire, turn the stove off. DO NOT use water to extinguish the flames; it will spread a grease fire and may cause electrical shock. Instead, shake salt or baking soda on the flames, or use a fire extinguisher. Fire Exit Paths According to City of Madison Fire Safety Codes, all exits and entryways must be kept entirely clear an d easily accessible. This means you cannot store anything (including shoes, trash, plants, or toys) in hallways, staircases, or entryways, or on fire rescue platforms (the small fire escape balconies). Outdoor toys, grills, bikes, sleds, and outside (foldi ng/stacking) chairs may be stored neatly on patios and balconies in the 700s, 800s, and 900s areas of Eagle Heights, as long as a four -foot-wide pathway is maintained. In University Houses, the area between your kitchen and your neighbor's (sometimes refer red to as a \"utility closet\" or \"storage area\") must be kept clear. The City of Madison Fire Marshal can write citations (tickets) to residents if the fire codes are not followed. Fire Related Regulations, Including Candles and Open Flames Tampering with a fire alarm is a crime. Anyone caught setting off a false alarm will be charged for response time, and there could be additional lease or legal consequences. Never overload electrical outlets. Do not use electrical cords that are damaged in any way. Do n ot let candles burn for long periods of time or leave them unattended. 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 189 Keep matches and lighters away from children.

Portable Electric Appliances University Apartments does not restrict or have policy information relating to portable electric appliances other than restricting the use of portable dishwashers. The Fire Safety information available on -line includes: Fire Alarms In any large apartment community, there are occasional false fire alarms. But there are also real fires, often starting in kitchens. NOTE: When you hear a fire alarm, always vacate your apartment! In University Apartments, there are several different types of fire alarm systems. All building fire alarm systems in Eagle Heights, Harvey Street Apartments and University Houses report directly to University Police, who will then contact the fire depar tment. \"Pull Stations\" to Activate Fire Alarms Residents must activate a fire alarm pull station inside their apartment or in the common stairwell to activate the building fire alarm system. In University Houses, the pull stations are found in basements where resident storage is located in buildings 5, 10, 21, 30, 35 and 39. In the event of a fire, first notify your neighbors and the fire department by activating the nearest pull station, then call 911. There is no charge for calling the fire department. If time allows, contact the Apartment Facilities Office (M -F 7:00 AM-3:30 PM) or the Resident Manager on Duty (after hours). Smoke Detectors There are active smoke detectors in each apartment throughout University Apartments. These only sound a local alarm; they are not linked to the University Police or fire department. In the apartments smoke detectors are interconnected and \"hard wired\" into the electrical system, with battery back -up. Sometimes people are tempted to disconnect their smoke detectors so they do not sound 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 196 during cooking. This is a serious lease violation. You will be held responsible for payment of fire damages to buildings an d their contents if investigation following a fire reveals an apartment smoke detector did not function due to negligence on your part (removal of the smoke detector, or failure to replace a weak or missing battery), or if the fire was caused by you. A cha rge may be made for fixing non - operating detectors if found during normal maintenance calls. If the detector goes off by mistake and you temporarily remove the battery, be sure to replace it. \"Beeping\" Smoke Detectors If the alarm beeps periodically, it m eans the battery needs to be replaced. Free smoke detector batteries are available at the University Apartments Office or Apartment Facilities Office. Carbon Monoxide Detectors There are active carbon monoxide detectors in all Harvey Street apartments because those apartments have gas stoves. There are detectors in all Eagle Heights apartments that are adjacent to the boiler rooms. These are battery powered. In University Houses there is one carbon monoxide detector in every unit tied into the smoke detect or system with battery back -up. If the alarm is constant, you should leave the apartment and contact the Apartment Facilities Office or the Resident Manager on Duty. If it is \"chirping\" or beeping every few seconds, that means it is time to change the bat teries. You can get new batteries from the University Apartments Office, the Apartment Facilities Office or from the Resident Manager on Duty. Fire Extinguishers Tampering with a fire extinguisher is a crime. If you observe someone tampering with an extin guisher, notify the University Police immediately. Also, notify the Apartment Facilities Office so that the extinguisher can be checked to ensure it is in working order. Make sure everyone in your household knows the location of the fire extinguishers in y our building. Kitchen Fires Kitchen fires usually occur because someone put something on the stove to cook, and then became involved in another activity or left the apartment. Another frequent cause of fire is grease build -up in the kitchen. NEVER leave a stove unattended if it is in use. Keep the stove, kitchen walls, and all areas near the stove free of grease. In the event of a stove fire, turn the stove off. DO NOT use water to extinguish the flames; it will spread a grease fire and may cause electrical shock. Instead, shake salt or baking soda on the flames, or use a fire extinguisher. Fire Exit Paths According to City of Madison Fire Safety Codes, all exits and entryways must be kept entirely clear and easily accessible. This means you cannot s tore anything (including shoes, trash, plants, or toys) in hallways, staircases, or entryways, or on fire rescue platforms (the small fire escape balconies). Outdoor toys, grills, bikes, 2019 University of Wisconsin- Madison Annual Security Report & Annual Fire Safety Report 197 sleds, and outside (folding/stacking) chairs may be stored neatly on patios and balconies in the 700s, 800s, and 900s areas of Eagle Heights, as long as a four -foot-wide pathway is maintained.

Evacuation is required for your safety and also for the safety of the firefighters, University Police officers, and Housing staff members who respond during fire alarms. During evacuation, keep the following in mind: Before opening your door, check to see if the door or doorknob is hot. If it is not hot, or if there is no smoke coming under your room door, proceed with the emergency proced ures under Fire Emergencies on the following page. Close your room door. Walk, don't run. Use the designated exit for your room on the evacuation guide that is posted. If smoke or fumes are coming up the stairwell, use an alternate exit. Once you're out of the building, move as far away as possible from the exit to protect your own safety and to allow firefighters access to the building. If you do not leave during a fire alarm CALS Short Course Halls staff will notify University Police for possible legal action. Your decision places not only yourself, but other individuals in danger.
