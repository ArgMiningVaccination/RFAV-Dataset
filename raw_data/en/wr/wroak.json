(2008). Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: A Practical Guide for Tuberculosis Programs That Provide Services to Persons from Mexico. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and for Providing Culturally Competent Tuberculosis Services to Persons from 5. Common Perceptions, Attitudes, and Beliefs About Tuberculosis Among A Practical Guide for Tuberculosis Programs That Provide Services to Persons from Mexico is one guide in a series that aims to help tuberculosis (TB) program staff provide culturally competent TB care to some of our highest priority foreign-born populations. Other guides in the series focus on persons from China, Somalia, Vietnam, and Laos. Intended Audience This guide is intended for health care providers, community-based workers, program planners, administrators, health educators, and resettlement agencies that work with Mexican communities. This guide is designed to increase the knowledge and cultural sensitivity of health care providers, program planners, and any others serving persons from Mexico. The ultimate aim is to foster culturally competent TB care and services for Mexicans in the United States. About the Guides Each guide in this series includes the following: A two-page summary of program tips. Chapters on history and immigration; culture; health issues; and common perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about TB. A concluding summary. Appendices, including additional resources for working with TB patients and interpreters. Useful resources. References. Some of the information in the guides, such as the practical tips, can be applied directly, while other sections are more informative and will help providers better understand the background and sociocultural context of the population. A deeper understanding of pertinent issues will heighten the cultural sensitivity of TB care providers, enhance communication, and improve the overall effectiveness of organizations and staff in cross-cultural settings. The content of these guides was gathered in two ways. First, an in-depth review of TB-related epidemiologic, behavioral, and ethnographic literature on Mexicans in the United States was performed. Secondly, in 2003, the Division of T uberculosis Elimination (DTBE) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) undertook a qualitative study to describe ethnographic aspects of the increasing burden of TB among five foreign-born populations. Selected major findings from this study are presented in each of the guides.6Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide How to Use This Guide The tips section at the front of the guide provides a summary of practical suggestions, which are also interspersed throughout the guide in textboxes. Keep these tips readily accessible and refer to them as often as necessary. The chapters on history, immigration, and cultural issues (Chapters 1 and 2) provide important background information on the cultural group. Depending on your needs and interests, you will want to read in depth or skim. Chapter 3 begins with \"Health Statistics at a Glance,\" which highlights TB and related health issues. The remainder of the chapter expands upon this information. If you provide direct health services, you may wish to read this section in depth. Chapter 4 provides information about special issues facing Mexicans in the United States. Chapter 5 contains findings from the CDC study on common TB perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs. If you work directly with TB patients, you will want to read this section thoroughly. Appendix A presents a set of questions that can be used to elicit a patient's understanding or perception of his or her own health problems. You may wish to use these questions or slightly modified questions to begin a conversation with a new TB patient. Appendix B provides suggestions for working with interpreters. Refer to these suggestions when working with people with limited English proficiency. Appendix C provides a list of resources for both patients and providers. These resources include culture-specific educational materials and fact sheets. Use them to enhance communication with patients of different cultures. Refer to the other appendices as needed.7Background Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most deadly infectious diseases. Although it is curable and preventable, TB claims the lives of more than 5,000 people every day (nearly 2 million deaths per year) (World Health Organization [WHO], 2006a). TB disproportionately affects poor and marginalized groups of society who are often at higher risk for TB, both around the world and in the United States (Dubos & Dubos, 1952; Mitnick, Furin, Henry, 2001). Domestically, the number of TB cases has decreased steadily since 1992, but this reduction has not affected all populations equally. In 2005, the TB case rate among foreign-born persons was almost nine times that of persons born in the United States (21.9/100,000 compared with 2.5/100,000). The same year, 55% of all TB cases in the United States were among foreign-born persons (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2006b). Most cases among this group result from reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired in countries of birth with high TB prevalence (Zuber, McKenna, Binkin, Onorato, & Castro, 1997). The high incidence of TB in the United States among foreign-born persons poses challenges to public health programs across the country (CDC, 2006b). Although disparities between U.S.-born and foreign-born TB patients are caused by multiple factors, persons born outside the United States often face challenges related to personal or cultural beliefs, behaviors, and needs when accessing TB services. Attempts to control TB in foreign-born populations have sometimes been hindered by cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as challenges related to resettlement, employment, and socioeconomic position. Understanding these issues is crucial to the prevention and control of TB among foreign-born populations. Cultural Competency in Tuberculosis Service Delivery Cultural competence is an essential element of quality health care and can help improve health outcomes, increase clinic efficiency, and produce greater patient satisfaction (Brach & Fraser, 2000). Although there is no one universally accepted definition of cultural competence, it may generally be understood to be a set of attitudes, skills, behaviors, and policies that enable organizations and staff to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. Furthermore, it reflects the ability to acquire and use knowledge of the health-related beliefs, attitudes, practices, and communication patterns of patients and their families in order to improve services, strengthen programs, increase community participation, and close the gaps in health status among diverse population groups (U.S. Office of Minority Health, 2006). Linguistically appropriate services are a key component of culturally competent health systems. In 2001, the U.S. Office of Minority Health issued Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Service (CLAS) standards to help health care organizations move toward cultural competence (see Appendix C). Several of these standards are federal mandates supported by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (1964), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of national origin and language. In summary, these standards aim to ensure that all federally funded health facilities provide services in a language understood by patients. To move towards cultural competence, health care providers and other program staff should understand the ethnic and cultural needs of the populations they serve. Providing effective care involves taking the time to learn from patients what is important to them in the experience of illness and treatment. According to medical anthropologist Arthur Kleinman, finding out \"what is at stake\" for the individual will provide crucial information to use in communication and in tailoring a treatment plan (Kleinman & Benson, 2006). Culture does matter in the clinic, and providers must remember that they too bring a cultural perspective to the patient-provider relationship. Increasing staff knowledge of the cultural and ethnic backgrounds of populations served is one important aspect of the CLAS standards.8Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Considerations When Using This Guide Although the information in this publication was gathered from many sources, it will not apply to all Mexicans in the United States. Mexican culture, as all others, is dynamic. Cultural perspectives may vary depending upon a person's age, sex, education, social class, or degree of acculturation. To ensure that TB services are both sensitive and appropriate, users of this guide are encouraged to use an approach grounded in an understanding of the cultural background of those served, while also appreciating each patient's individuality and uniqueness. Further, providers must also recognize their own beliefs and biases, as these may inadvertently be communicated to patients and families. Awareness of one's own verbal and nonverbal communication styles will help avoid social gaffes that may offend others and adversely affect the relationship. Good patient-provider relationships are built on trust and respect; therefore, providers wishing to care effectively for their patients should heighten their sensitivities to both differences and similarities and use knowledge to guide their practice (Lipson & Dibble, 2005). Clarification of Terms In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau designated the term \"Hispanic\" as an ethnic category referring to people from Mexico, Spain, or the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Hispanic and Latino are terms that suggest cultural and ethnic homogeneity; however, there is no consensus on a preferred term. In this guide, we use \"Hispanic/Latino\" when the original research refers to this broader group and the terms \"Mexican\" and \"Mexican American\" when research refers specifically to those groups. To understand the Mexican populations in the United States more fully, it may be helpful to determine the region of Mexico from which people originate, including the health beliefs, practices, and problems specific to the region.9Tips for Providing Culturally Competent Tuberculosis Services to Persons from Mexico Below are practical suggestions presented in Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: A Practical Guide for Tuberculosis Programs That Provide Services to Persons from Mexico . These tips are intended for tuberculosis (TB) program staff, including program planners, managers, and providers who work with persons from Mexico. For additional background and resources, please consult the full version of the guide. Interactions with Mexican Patients and Family Members Many Mexican patients may not speak English fluently and may prefer interactions and materials in Spanish. Ensure that adequate bilingual staff and Spanish-language materials are available. Because family is very important to Mexicans, it may be helpful to speak with both the patient and family members. However, to protect confidentiality, seek a patient's permission first. Take time to establish rapport. Mexican patients may more likely trust health care workers with whom they have a personal relationship. To build rapport, consider beginning a conversation with a story or small talk. Do not assume that nonverbal cues, such as nodding \"yes,\" mean that a patient is agreeing to take medications as prescribed. Seek a patient's permission before making physical contact during an examination. Mexicans may be uncomfortable being touched by a health care provider. Tuberculosis Diagnosis and Treatment Recognize that some Mexicans may use folk remedies. As a result, they may delay seeking treatment while waiting to see the effect of these remedies. When possible, discuss ways to incorporate traditional remedies into TB treatment. Because many medications, including antibiotics, are obtained easily in pharmacies in Mexico, it is important to ask patients what medicines or treatment they have taken for their symptoms. Unauthorized immigrants may avoid seeking health care because of the fear of deportation. Explain that they will not be deported because of their TB treatment. Many Mexicans immigrate for economic opportunities, thus value their jobs highly. TB care that minimizes job interference, such as Saturday hours or extended clinic hours, will more likely be accepted. Lack of transportation can severely hinder receipt of care. Consider alternative strategies, such as offering transportation or transportation tokens. If possible, use mobile units to test for and treat TB in communities. Outreach programs that combine services with culturally appropriate education are often more effective among at-risk populations with limited financial resources.10Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Mexican patients may have preconceptions about the role that the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine plays in producing a positive tuberculin skin test. Explain that for adults a large reaction likely indicates recent exposure to TB and that treatment can prevent TB disease. Use pamphlets about the vaccine to guide the conversation. Social Stigma To allay fears, emphasize the need for only short-term isolation during active TB treatment. Address concerns and confusion about the difference between TB disease and latent TB infection. Clarify that a person with latent TB infection does not need to be isolated and cannot spread germs. When promoting TB services, emphasize confidentiality. Tuberculosis Education and Outreach Take time to understand the patient's perceptions of TB. A two-way exchange offers the opportunity to tailor education, dispel inaccurate notions, and emphasize pertinent messages. Organize community leaders to hold discussions to highlight risk factors and address how TB is and is not transmitted. Provide community education about TB risk. Emphasize that risk is increased by spending time in places where TB is common, not by personal hygiene. When possible, provide tailored information in formats preferred by Mexican patients, namely community talks, public service announcements on TV or radio, or pamphlets in Spanish.11Chapter 1. Mexican History and Immigration to the United States Mexican Geography and History Mexico, a country composed of 31 states and home to 105 million people, is bor-dered by Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California to the north; Guatemala and Belize to the south; the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico to the east; and the Pacific Ocean to the west (Smith, 2000; U.S. Department of State, 2004). Though the Olmecs, Mayas, Toltecs, and Aztecs originally inhabited the region, the Spanish ruled Mexico during 1521-1810. This led to the adoption of Spanish culture and language. After the Mexican War of Independence (1810-1821), the newly independent Mexican government attempted to gain control of all its regions, including Texas. The Mexican-American War (1845-1848) was sparked over control of Texas and ended with the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, in which Mexico ceded Texas and part of California to the United States (Smith, 2000). After the Mexican-American War, the government was considerably weakened and faced reconstruction problems and economic hardships. The popular rejection of dictator Porfirio D\u00edaz led to the Mexican Revolution of 1910, a violent social and cultural movement. Though the Constitutional Congress approved a new constitution in 1917, the violence continued until 1920. During the first half of the twentieth century, the increased stability of the government helped advance economic and social development. Because of recent changes in economic policy, especially those attributable to the 1994 North American Free T rade Agreement (Sanchez & Karp, 2000), an agreement to establish mutually advantageous trade rules between North American countries (NAFTA Secretariat, 1992), Mexico has seen higher economic growth, including a surge in foreign investment and trade. Immigration to the United States Throughout its history, the United States has attracted Mexican immigrants in search of employment and economic opportunities. During 1850-1880, Mexican workers immigrated to the United States (mainly Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas) as part of a general, foreign labor movement. During the early 1900s-1960s, the migration of Mexican workers fluctuated with historic events, including the Mexican Revolution, the Great Depression, World War II, and the Bracero T reaty (1942) that allowed millions of Mexicans to work under contract with U.S. growers and ranchers (Library of Congress, 2002; Public Broadcasting Service, 2005). 12Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide After the Bracero program ended in 1964, the major U.S. policies to affect Mexican immigration have included the Immigration Act of 1965 and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. These policies legalized more than two million Mexicans who had lived in the United States for a specified length of time and removed immigration quotas on the basis of national origin. In 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act was passed to strengthen the border and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants. Currently, Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the United States. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Hispanics constitute 12.5% (35 million) of the U.S. population, and at 67%, Mexicans represent the largest percentage of Hispanics (Ramirez & de la Cruz, 2002). By 2050, the Hispanic population is predicted to double in size to 24% and become the largest minority population. Though the greatest concentrations of Hispanics reside in California, Texas, and Illinois, states with considerable growth over the past decade include Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona, and Idaho (Greico, 2003). Mexicans represent the largest group of legal immigrants in the United States, accounting for about one-fifth of immigrants (Passel, 2004). Each year, an estimated 800,000-1 million immigrants make the journey between Mexico and the United States (Greico, 2003). Mexico is also the largest source of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. Of the 9.2 million Mexican-born people living in the United States in 2000, almost 70% were unauthorized (United States Immigration and Naturalization Service Office of Policy and Planning, 2003).13Chapter 2. Overview of Mexican Culture This chapter provides an overview of Mexican culture in terms of social structure, family, gender, religion, language, literacy, communication styles, socioeconomic position, traditional health beliefs and practices, and health care-seeking behaviors. Readers are cautioned to avoid stereotyping Mexicans on the basis of these broad generalizations. Also note that Mexican culture, as all others, is dynamic and expressed in various ways, owing to individual life experience and personality. Some Mexicans living in the United States may be more or less acculturated to mainstream U.S. culture. Social Structure, Family, and Gender Typically, Mexican households in the United States consist of five or more people (Therrien & Ramirez, 2001). The traditional patriarchal structure grants the father or oldest male relative the greatest power, whereas women are expected to show submission (Kemp & Rasbridge, 2004). Though a matriarch often determines when a family member needs medical care, the male head still gives permission to seek treatment (Smith, 2000). The entire family, however, may be involved in the decision-making process (Galanti, 2004). Religion Christianity is the most common religion. Most Mexicans (89%) identify themselves as Catholic, while a smaller percentage (6%) identify themselves as Protestant (U.S. Department of State, 2004). Faith and church are often central to family and community life; this is especially apparent in the understanding of illnesses and healing (Kemp & Rasbridge, 2004). Although the Aztec religion, a system of animism (belief that spirits inhabit natural objects) and polytheism (worship of more than one god), is nearly extinct, some aspects are preserved in traditional medical beliefs (Smith, 2000).

Because family is very important to Mexicans, it may be helpful to speak with both the patient and family members. However, to protect confidentiality, seek a patient's permission first. Do not assume that nonverbal cues, such as nodding \"yes,\" mean that a patient is agreeing to take medications as prescribed.Suggestion14Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Language and Literacy Spanish is the official language of Mexico; however, as many as 100 Native American languages, such as Nahuatl, Maya, Mixteco, and Zapoteco, are still spoken by nearly 8% of the population (Gordon, 2005). Because of public education programs, the literacy rate in Mexico has improved over the past 35 years. Among Mexicans aged 15 years and older, the literacy rate rose from 74% in 1970 to 89% in 2004 (U.S. Department of State, 2004). A brief list of Spanish phrases and tuberculosis vocabulary is provided in Appendix E. Communication Styles Communication styles often reflect Mexican cultural values and can influence how Mexicans interact with one another and with health care providers. Both verbal and nonverbal communication can impact the experience of Mexican patients in a health care setting and may influence their care-seeking behaviors and treatment adherence. Verbal Communication Mexican social norms emphasize the importance of personal relationships (Salimbene, 2000; Smith, 2000). Verbal communication should be courteous and respectful. The Spanish usted form (i.e., the formal, polite \"you\") should be used to address patients (Guarnero, 2005). Familismo is the value of family over individual or community needs and the expression of strong loyalty, reciprocity, and solidarity among family members (Postgraduate Medical Council of New South Wales, n.d.; Smith, 2000; University of Washington Medical Center, 1999). Mexican patients may want to include family members in discussions of treatment and care; therefore, it may be helpful for the provider to speak with both the patient and his or her family. However, to protect confidentiality, providers should first get permission from the patient. A young girl in Mexico. \u00a9 2006 Enriqueta Valdez-Curiel. Courtesy of Photoshare. Unauthorized immigrants may avoid seeking health care because of the fear of deportation. Explain that they will not be deported because of their TB treatment. Because many medications, including antibiotics, are obtained easily in pharmacies in Mexico, it is important to ask patients what medicines or treatment they have taken for their symptoms.Suggestion15Nonverbal Communication Although maintaining eye contact is a sign of respect in some cultures, Mexicans may interpret it as a challenge or intimidation. Additionally, a patient's silence may indicate many things, such as doubt, shyness, disapproval, anger, politeness, or not understanding. It should not be interpreted as agreement or disagreement. The provider can attempt to clarify with further explanation or additional questions. During an examination, patients may feel uncomfortable being touched by a health care provider, as this contact is generally reserved for family members and close friends (Guarnero, 2005). Socioeconomic Position in the United States Economic opportunity fuels Mexican population growth in the United States. Mexicans, legal and illegal, are drawn by better paying jobs to support their families in Mexico (Library of Congress, 2002; Public Broadcasting Service, 2005). Although wages are higher, Mexicans living in the United States often face social and economic challenges. Nearly 70% of Mexicans (aged 25 years and older) do not have a high school diploma or its equivalent, compared with 22% of the general U.S. population. In 1999, the median income among Mexican families was about $30,000 (compared with the U.S. median of $50,000), and 24% of Mexican families lived in poverty (compared with 9.2% of the U.S. population) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). In the 2002 National Survey of Latinos, 39% of Mexicans reported having no health insurance (Pew Hispanic Center & Kaiser Family Foundation, 2004). Research suggests a lack of health insurance results in fewer visits to primary care physicians (Hough et al., 1987; T revino, Moyer, Valdez, & Stroup-Benham, 1991) and more emergency room visits (Smith, 2000).

Mexican patients may more likely trust health care workers with whom they have a personal relationship. To build rapport, consider beginning a conversation with a story or small talk.Suggestion16Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Traditional Health Beliefs and Practices The meaning of health varies among Mexicans. Some may maintain that health results from good luck or is a reward for good behavior (Spector, 1996). Furthermore, illnesses are thought to have either natural or supernatural causes. The following are descriptions of common Mexican folk illnesses, causes, and remedies. Humoral Imbalance In general, physical and mental illness is thought to result from an imbalance between a person and the environment, expressed as either \"hot\" and \"cold\" or \"wet\" and \"dry\" (Kemp & Rasbridge, 2004; Spector, 1996). The four humors contained in the body include blood (hot and wet), yellow bile (hot and dry), phlegm (cold and wet), and black bile (cold and dry) (Spector, 1996). An imbalance of the humors causes illness. Humors vary by person, depending on where in Mexico a person originates. To correct an imbalance, people consume foods or herbs with the opposite quality (e.g., \"cold\" conditions are treated with \"hot\" medications). If a health care provider suggests a remedy deemed inappropriate for a particular condition (e.g., penicillin, a \"hot\" medicine, for a \"hot\" disease such as fever), patients are less likely to comply (Smith, 2000). Empacho Illness can also result from a \"dislocation\" of different parts of the body. One example of dislocation is empacho , a form of upset stomach or indigestion, thought to be caused by eating the wrong food at the wrong time of day, eating undercooked food, or swallowing gum. Empacho includes common symptoms such as stomach pain or cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, or constipation. The most common treatment is rubbing the stomach or back gently with cooking oil and pinching the spine (Smith, 2000; Spector, 1996).

Many Mexican patients may not speak English fluently and may prefer interactions and materials in Spanish. Ensure that adequate bilingual staff and Spanish-language materials are available.Suggestion17Mal de Ojo Mal de ojo (\"bad eye\") is caused when someone looks with admiration or jealousy at another person. The person looked upon experiences malaise, sleepiness, fatigue, and severe headache. Folk remedies include saying a prayer while passing an egg over the victim's body then placing the egg in a bowl under the victim's bed overnight, or alternately, having the person who caused mal de ojo care for the victim (Kemp & Rasbridge, 2004; Smith, 2000). Envidia Many Mexicans believe envidia, or envy, causes illness and bad luck. Envy can be provoked by success, but can result in misfortune and illness. Some research concludes that low economic status is associated with the belief in envidia (Spector, 1996). Susto Susto, also known as fright sickness, arises from a traumatic or frightening experience and is thought to cause soul loss, whereby the soul leaves the body and wanders freely. Although susto affects men and women, women are considered more at risk than men (Kemp & Rasbridge, 2004). Symptoms include anxiety, depression, insomnia, introversion, irritability, lethargy, and anorexia. T uberculosis (TB) is sometimes classified as susto. T reatments for susto include herbal teas, relaxation techniques, covering the face with a cloth and sprinkling holy water, spitting a mouthful of water or alcohol into the person's face unexpectedly, or the use of a folk healer to coax the soul back to the person's body (Kemp & Rasbridge, 2004; Spector, 1996).Culture Recognize that some Mexicans may use folk remedies. As a result, they may delay seeking treatment while waiting to see the effect of these remedies. When possible, discuss ways to incorporate traditional remedies into TB treatment. Seek a patient's permission before making physical contact during an examination. Mexicans may be uncomfortable being touched by a health care provider.Suggestion18Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Health Care-seeking Behaviors Mexicans may combine traditional health care practices with Western medicine. In Mexico, Western medicine is prevalent in larger cities; however, urban Mexicans who cannot afford these services often resort to traditional practices. T raditional health-seeking behaviors include using home remedies and seeking care from relatives, neighbors, community members, or traditional health care providers. Home remedies often include drinking herbal or spiced teas. If the home remedy is ineffective, the ill person may consult a yerbero (herbalist), a sobador (massage therapist), or a partera (midwife) (Kemp & Rasbridge, 2004). If a person does not experience relief, he or she may seek the services of a curandero (holistic healer). Curanderos , male or female, address the social, physical, spiritual, and psychological aspects of health. Other forms of healing that may be used during the treatment process include conducting religious rituals such as prayer, using religious symbols (either worn on the body or kept in the home), making promises, and visiting shrines (Spector, 1996). Some medications sold only by prescription in the United States, including antibiotics, may be purchased easily without a prescription from Mexican farmacias (pharmacies). Regardless of their insurance status, Mexicans living in the United States may make regular trips to Mexico to purchase medications at a lower cost (Becker, Garcia, & Ellertson, 2004; Calvillo & Lal, 2003; Flores, Ochoa, Briggs, Garcia, & Kroeger, 2003). Further, Mexicans living in the United States are likely to travel to Mexico to purchase TB medications to avoid the social or legal stigma associated with divulging their TB status in a Western health setting (Flores et al., 2003; Larkey, Hecht, Miller, & Alatorre, 2001). In Mexico, antibiotics are the most commonly purchased medication as nearly 43% of antibiotic purchases may be made without a prescription (Calva & Bojalil, 1996). Many Mexican pharmacy workers, however, may not be licensed to sell antibiotics, and may sell customers an inadequate regimen or incomplete course of TB medication, which may contribute to drug resistance.

The Health of Mexicans Health Statistics at a Glance Tuberculosis In Mexico In 2005, the estimated tuberculosis (TB) incidence was 23 per 100,000 (WHO, 2006b). In 2004, 2.4% of new TB cases were multidrug-resistant (WHO, 2006b). Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine coverage at birth is 99% (WHO, 2005). In the United States In 2005, 25% of TB cases among foreign-born persons occurred in persons from Mexico (CDC, 2006b). HIV/AIDS In Mexico, the prevalence of AIDS in adults is 0.3% (World Resources Institute, 2006). In the United States, Hispanics (approximately 67% of whom are of Mexican origin) account for about 16% of the total diagnosed AIDS cases (CDC, 2005a; Ramirez & de la Cruz, 2002). Hispanic males in the United States have a higher AIDS case rate than Hispanic females (40.3 compared with 12.4 per 100,000 population) (CDC, 2003a). Among Mexican males in the United States, the majority of AIDS cases occur among men who have sex with men and among injection drug users (CDC, 2003b). Diabetes Mellitus Since 2000, diabetes has become the principal cause of death in Mexico among women and the second leading cause of death among men (Rull et al., 2005). In the United States, Mexicans are twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to be diagnosed with diabetes (National Center for Health Statistics, 2006). By 1998, 1.2 million of the 30 million Hispanics in the United States had been diagnosed with diabetes, and it is estimated that another 675,000 are undiagnosed (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). End-stage Renal Disease In the United States, Mexicans are 1.45 times more likely than non-Hispanic whites to have end-stage renal disease (Tareen et al., 2005). Cancer Data from 1988-1998 show significantly greater incidences of leukemia in Hispanic children compared with non-Hispanic whites in the United States (61.5 cases per 106 person-years compared with 48.8 cases per 106 person-years) (Wilkinson et al., 2005).20Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Tuberculosis Among Mexicans In Mexico Over the past 15 years in Mexico, the estimated TB incidence has steadily decreased from a rate of 49 per 100,000 in 1990 to 33 per 100,000 in 2002 (World Bank Group, 2002). In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an estimated TB incidence of 23 per 100,000 (2006b). One study showed that primary resistance to one or more first- line TB drugs used in Mexico (isoniazid, rifampin, or pyrazinamide) was 12%; acquired resistance (among patients with prior treatment with anti-TB drugs) was 50% (CDC, 1998). In 2004, according to the WHO, 2.4% of new TB cases in Mexico were defined as multidrug- resistant (resistant at least to isoniazid and rifampin) (2006b). In 1996, Mexico began implementing directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS). As of 2005, DOTS was available to 100% of Mexicans (WHO, 2006b). In the United States During 1993-2005, TB surveillance data showed that Mexicans living in the United States consistently accounted for the largest proportion of TB cases among all foreign-born groups. In 2005, 25% (n=1942) of TB cases among foreign-born persons in the United States occurred in persons from Mexico (CDC, 2006b). During 2000-2004, the total case count was 9,555. Over that period, 6.4% of TB cases were resistant to isoniazid and 27.3% were extrapulmonary (CDC, 2005b). In 2005, 15% of reported TB cases among Mexican adults (n=1871) occurred among those who had been in the United States for 1 year or less; 20% occurred among those in the United States 1-4 years; and 50% occurred among those in the United States 5 or more years. For the remainder, the number of years in the United States prior to diagnosis was unknown (CDC, 2006b). See Appendix F for information about tuberculosis screening policies for persons overseas.

Courtesy of Photoshare.21Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is currently used in many parts of the world as a vaccine against TB. In Mexico, BCG vaccine coverage at birth is 99% (WHO, 2005). Post-vaccination tuberculin reactivity is not an indicator of the protective efficacy of BCG vaccination, because it is not an indicator of immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Reaction to a tuberculin skin test caused by BCG vaccination wanes rapidly in individuals who receive the vaccine in the neonatal period and more slowly in those vaccinated at an older age (Menzies, 2000). CDC's current TB testing guidelines state that a positive reaction to tuberculin in BCG-vaccinated persons indicates infection with M. tuberculosis when the person tested is at increased risk for recent infection or has medical conditions that increase the risk for disease. (See Table 7 in the June 09, 2000 MMWR for criteria for tuberculin positivity.)* Therefore, a history of BCG vaccination should not influence decisions about treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) (CDC, 2000). * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Health22Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Tuberculosis-related Health Issues Understanding other health issues affecting the lives of Mexican patients provides critical information for TB care providers. Conditions that can increase the risk of LTBI progressing to TB disease include the following (CDC, 2004): HIV/AIDS. Previous TB (in a person who received inadequate or no treatment) indicated by chest radiograph findings. Prolonged corticosteroid therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy. Recent infection with M. tuberculosis (within the past 2 years). Substance abuse (especially intravenous drug use). Silicosis. Diabetes mellitus. End-stage renal disease. Cancer of the head and neck. Hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases. Intestinal bypass or gastrectomy. Chronic malabsorption syndromes. Low body weight (10% or more below ideal). Of these conditions, those that are most relevant to people from Mexico are further explored here. HIV/AIDS Once a person is infected with M. tuberculosis , HIV infection is the strongest known risk factor for developing TB disease. While the average probability of progressing from TB infection to disease is less than 10% over the lifetime of a person not infected with HIV, the risk is 5%-8% per year for those who are HIV-infected and not on Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) (Markowitz et al., 1997; Selwyn et al., 1989), a combined use of several antiretroviral drugs that inhibits the ability of the virus to multiply in the body (National Cancer Institute, n.d.). The effect of HAART on the progression from TB infection to TB disease is not well understood (Markowitz et al., 1997; Selwyn et al., 1989), though some evidence indicates that it may have a protective effect on the risk of developing TB (Badri, Wilson, & Wood, 2002; Girardi et al., 2000; al., 2004; Dworkin, & DeCock, 2000; Santoro-Lopes, Felix de Pinho, Harrison, & Schechter, 2002). In addition, research suggests that active TB disease accelerates the course of untreated HIV infection, which may lead to more opportunistic infections and earlier death (Lopez-Gatell et al., 2007; Thomas, 2006; Whalen et al., 1995; Whalen et al., 2000; Zar et al., 2007).23In Mexico, the prevalence of AIDS in adults is 0.3% (World Resources Institute, 2006). In the United States, Hispanic males have a higher AIDS case rate than Hispanic females (40.3 compared with 12.4 per 100,000 population) (CDC, 2003a). Among Mexican males in the United States, most AIDS cases occur among men who have sex with men and among injection drug users (CDC, 2003b). Table 3-1 presents the estimated number of diagnosed AIDS cases in the United States in 2005 and cumulatively since the beginning of the epidemic. Hispanics (approximately 67% of whom are of Mexican origin) comprise about 16% of the total diagnosed AIDS cases (CDC, 2005a; Ramirez & de la Cruz, 2002). Substance Use Both TB and drug use are prevalent in crowded, low-income areas. As a result, drug users are 2-6 times more likely to be infected with TB than nonusers (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1999). In addition, alcohol abuse may increase among Mexican migrants as a result of stress over economic hardship (Finch, Catalano, Novaco, & Vega, 2003). Diabetes Mellitus People with diabetes are at a higher risk of progressing from latent TB infection to TB disease. TB occurs more frequently among diabetics and causes greater mortality (Guptan & Shah, 2000). Diabetes has a significant impact on the lives of Hispanics, including Mexican-Americans. In the United States, rates among Hispanics are similar to those of black males, though lower than those of black females. The rates among Hispanics are much greater than those among non-Hispanic whites. Since 2000, diabetes has been the principal cause of death in Mexico among women and the second leading cause of death among men (Rull et al., 2005). Also in Mexico, diabetes is the number one cause of adult, non-obstetric hospital admission (Jimenez-Cruz & Bacardi-Gascon, 2004). By 1998, 1.2 million of the 30 million Hispanics in the United States had been diagnosed with diabetes, and it is estimated that another 675,000 are undiagnosed (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). During 2001-2004, Mexicans were twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to be diagnosed with diabetes, and in 2004, Hispanics were 1.5 times as likely as non-Hispanic whites to die from diabetes (National Center for Health Statistics, 2006).Table 3-1.

In the United States, Mexicans suffer from disproportionately high rates of ESRD in comparison with non-Hispanic whites. Mexicans are 1.45 times more likely than non-Hispanic whites to develop ESRD (Tareen et al., 2005). Cancer Though cancer data is limited for the Hispanic American population, certain cancers affect Hispanics more. In 2003, Hispanic women were 2.2 times more likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer than non-Hispanic white women (Office of Minority Health, n.d.). Hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, increase the risk of progression to TB disease, and these diseases appear to affect Hispanics more than non-Hispanic whites. In 2003, research showed that Hispanics had lower one-year and three-year leukemia survival rates when compared with non-Hispanic whites (Serna et al., 2003). Data from 1988-1998 show significantly greater incidence of leukemia among Hispanic children in the United States compared with non-Hispanic whites (age-standardized incidence rates, 61.5 cases per 106 person-years compared with 48.8 cases per 106 person-years) (Wilkinson et al., 2005). Incidence of Hodgkin's disease was greater in Hispanic children than in non-Hispanic white children, but the difference was not significant (Wilkinson et al., 2005).Figure 3-2.

This bacterium, a species of the M. tuberculosis complex, primarily infects cattle but can be transmitted to humans who consume unpasteurized milk products from countries such as Mexico where M. bovis is common. To protect against M. bovis, people, especially young children and the immunosuppressed, should not consume unlabeled or unpasteurized products such as cotija, crema mexicana, queso fresco, and queso blanco.Health26Chapter 4. Special Issues Among Mexicans in the United States The proximity of Mexico to the United States creates a number of special issues that may impact the health of Mexicans living in the United States. Seasonal and Migrant Farm Workers A seasonal farm worker is defined as an individual required to be absent from a permanent place of residence to seek employment in agricultural work (Migrant Clinician Network, 2005). In the United States, approximately 92% of seasonal farm workers were born in Mexico (Rosenbaum & Shin, 2005). Migrant and seasonal farm workers and their families confront health challenges that stem from extreme poverty, mobility, the nature of the work, and living and working arrangements that impede access to health care and insurance. Health Care Coverage Seasonal farm workers and their families are less likely to have health insurance and, as a result, are extremely underinsured. In 2000, 85% of migrant and seasonal farm workers were uninsured, compared with 37% of the general U.S. population (Rosenbaum & Shin, 2005). Of the 15% who were insured, only 5% were covered by Medicaid, the state-controlled program that pays for medical care for people with low incomes and few resources (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, n.d.). Difficulties accessing Medicaid services include ineligibility for benefits, difficulty enrolling, state residency barriers, and inaccessible site locations. Limited Income Seasonal and migrant farm workers have much lower annual incomes than those of the average American. In 2000, the median income for seasonal workers was $6,250 compared with $42,000 for U.S. workers overall (Rosenbaum & Shin, 2005). English Literacy Many seasonal workers have trouble seeking health care because of significant language barriers. Approximately 90% report reading and speaking little or no English (Rosenbaum & Shin, 2005). Day Laborers In the United States, day laborers or jornaleros do a great deal of the construction, landscaping, and painting work. Although demographics vary greatly, day laborers are typically young males from Mexico or Central America (Valenzuela Jr., Theodore, Melendez, & Gonzalez, 2006). Many are unauthorized immigrants. Studies in the Los Angeles area show that day laborers often face dangerous working conditions and abuse by employers in the form of underpayment or nonpayment. Numerous groups advocate for better treatment of day laborers. Efforts include legalizing day laborers and providing a structured environment in which they can seek employment.27Unauthorized Immigrants Mexico accounts for the largest number of people who immigrate illegally to the United States. In 2005, Mexicans made up more than half of all unauthorized immigrants, approximately 6 million of the estimated 10.5 million illegal immigrants (Hoefer, Rytina, & Campbell, 2006). Among Mexican immigrants in the United States for fewer than 10 years, 80%-85% are estimated to be unauthorized (Passel, 2006). In addition, Mexicans have historically been the ethnic group least likely to become naturalized citizens (Rytina, 2006). Health Care Coverage Legal residents and low-income citizens are twice as likely to have health insurance than unauthorized immigrants and low-income non-citizens (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2003; Prentice, Pebley, & Sastry, 2005). In 2001, approximately 28% of low-income citizens lacked health insurance, whereas 60% of low-income non-citizens lacked health insurance (Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2003). Although unauthorized immigrants are eligible for Medicaid in some states, usage is low. Unauthorized Mexican immigrants may avoid seeking health care, even when urgently needed, because they fear deportation to Mexico (Chavez, 1984). Limited Income Unauthorized workers earn considerably less than authorized workers. Specifically, about two thirds of unauthorized workers in the United States earn less than twice the minimum wage. In contrast, only one third of U.S. workers earn similar wages (Passel, Capps, & Fix, 2004). Many financial assistance programs, such as Supplemental Security Income or Social Security, are unavailable to unauthorized immigrants, and they may be prohibited from other social services, such as food stamps (Berk, Schur, Chavez, & Frankel, 2000).Special Issues Mexican patients may have preconceptions about the role that the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine plays in producing a positive tuberculin skin test. Explain that for adults a large reaction likely indicates recent exposure to TB and that treatment can prevent TB disease. Use pamphlets about the vaccine to guide the conversation. Suggestion28Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Border State Residents In 2005, 25% of TB cases among foreign-born persons occurred in persons from Mexico (CDC, 2006b). In the border states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, TB case rates among people born in Mexico were 5 times higher than rates among those born in the United States. Additionally, approximately 75% of TB cases among people born in Mexico are found in this border region (Schneider, Laserson, Wells, & Moore, 2004). Low socioeconomic position, crowded living conditions, limited access to health care, and frequent border crossings have contributed to the rise in TB rates on both sides of the border (CDC, 2001). Additional factors, such as conflicting cultural expectations, language barriers, limited cross-border coordination, and lack of cultural competence among some providers, also contribute to delays in diagnosis and treatment and low overall quality of health care (Rodriguez-Reimann, Nicassio, Reimann, Gallegos, & Olmedo, 2004). Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis TB patients born in Mexico and living on the U.S.-Mexico border are more likely than U.S.-born patients to be infected with strains resistant to one or more first-line drugs (Markowitz et al., 1997). Proximity to the border does not seem to account for differences in rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. This suggests that patients may be infected with MDR TB in Mexico prior to their arrival in the United States (Schneider et al., 2004). CureTB System For TB patients who frequently cross the U.S.-Mexico border, receiving continuous and effective care is a challenge. Binational collaborations such as CureTB were developed to help medical providers coordinate. CureTB facilitates the exchange of information between health care providers in the United States and Mexico and serves as a referral program for TB patients and their contacts who frequently travel between the two countries. Services are available to all patients and providers in the United States and Mexico (Health and Human Services Agency, County of San Diego, n.d.). The program can be accessed by calling (619) 542-4013 or visiting http://www2.sdcounty.ca.gov/hhsa.29Chapter 5. Common Perceptions, Attitudes, and Beliefs About Tuberculosis Among Mexicans Findings from Tuberculosis-specific Behavioral and Social Science Research In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an ethnographic study of 50 Mexican-born persons in the United States to understand better the tuberculosis (TB)-related experiences, perceptions, and attitudes of Mexicans. In this chapter, this study is referred to as \"the CDC study.\" (See Appendix D for a description of the study design, methods, and study population.) The information presented in this chapter comes from both the CDC study and other TB-related behavioral and social science literature concerning Mexicans. It should be noted that the CDC study findings have limited generalizability because of the study's small, non-randomly selected sample; thus, the information will not apply to all Mexicans. Program staff should use discretion in determining how applicable the information may be for their specific context. However, taken as a whole, the research findings suggest several programmatic implications. Mexicans may not consider themselves at high risk for TB. The CDC study found that nearly half of respondents believed they were at low risk for TB, while the other half felt they were at medium risk. However, many respondents reported that their family and friends worried about contracting the disease (Joseph, Waldman, Rawls, Wilce, & Shrestha-Kuwahara, 2008). Perceptions of risk can reflect a respondent's level of knowledge about risk factors and transmission and may lead to delays in seeking care. Although some Mexicans may believe they are protected from TB disease because they received the BCG vaccine (Poss, 1998), no evidence of this perception was found in the CDC study. Indeed, the literature indicates a variety of beliefs among Mexicans regarding the BCG vaccine, particularly with respect to its purpose and effectiveness. In a study conducted in New York state, Mexican migrant workers commonly perceived that BCG prevented a wide array of diseases, from chicken pox to heart problems (Poss, 1998). In a Washington, DC, study of Latino immigrants including Mexicans, participants attributed their TB infection to having received the BCG vaccination (Ailinger & Dear, 1998). Similar findings were reported in a study of Mexicans residing on the U.S.-Mexico border near the Mexican state of Sonora (McEwen, 2005) and were supported by physicians in Mexico. In addition, one participant stated that a medical doctor in Mexico explained that \"people in the States don't understand [that] if you take the vaccine then of course you are going to come up positive. There was no need to take the medication.\" Organize community leaders to hold discussions to highlight risk factors and address how TB is and is not transmitted. Provide community education about TB risk. Emphasize that risk is increased by spending time in places where TB is common, not by personal hygiene.Suggestion30Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Mexicans may fear being ostracized by their friends and community if they reveal their TB status. Additionally, they may anticipate experiencing a deep sense of personal shame and expect to be treated differently. One man explained that a person with TB \"will be pushed away. He will not be invited to anyone's home again\" (Joseph et al., 2008). The literature agrees with this finding. One study of social and cultural factors in TB control found that many Mexican TB patients were not accepted back into their homes after being hospitalized for treatment (Rubel & Carro, 1992). In another study, participants cited numerous cases of people with TB being ostracized (McEwen, 2005). These concerns may delay care seeking and diminish adherence to treatment. In the CDC study, those who reported strong fears of ostracism were less likely to have received any TB education, which suggests that education may help decrease perceptions of stigma. Mexicans may not accurately understand TB transmission, symptoms, or prevention. In the CDC study, many respondents did not know that TB is transmitted through the air, and some believed TB could be transmitted by sharing eating utensils or exchanging bodily fluids (Joseph et al., 2008). Similar inaccuracies are documented in other studies. A small study conducted in New York state found that although most participants knew the cause of TB and its transmission, many listed alternative causes, such as smoking (Poss, 1998). Conversely, a study of Latino immigrants including Mexicans found that many participants did not know the cause of their TB infection (Ailinger & Dear, 1998). That TB is caused by smoking is not an unfounded perception, however. A recent meta-analysis showed consistent evidence that, while smoking does not cause TB, it is associated with an increased risk of contracting the disease (Lin, Ezzati, & Murray, 2007). Take time to understand the patient's perceptions of TB. A two-way exchange offers the opportunity to tailor education, dispel inaccurate notions, and emphasize pertinent messages. When promoting TB services, emphasize confidentiality.Suggestion To allay fears, emphasize the need for only short-term isolation during active TB treatment. Address concerns and confusion about the difference between TB disease and latent TB infection. Clarify that a person with latent TB infection does not need to be isolated and cannot spread germs.Suggestion31Mexicans may use alternative remedies or treatments for TB. Although many Mexicans reported they would seek professional medical help in Mexico if they thought they had TB, some indicated in the CDC study that they would use traditional health specialists. Additionally, to relieve symptoms and restore a perceived humoral imbalance, some Mexicans reportedly may use special teas and natural herbs obtained at tiendas naturistas (homeopathic stores) or farmacias (pharmacies). Providers should recognize that some Mexicans may choose alternative treatments or consult a pharmacist before seeing a doctor, especially if they consider the cost of treatment prohibitive. Challenges with TB treatment may be common. Some Mexicans taking treatment for TB or latent TB infection may have difficulty adhering to the treatment regimen. In the CDC study, respondents had concerns about side effects of the medicine, and many mentioned difficulty remembering to take the pills on a regular basis. They also faced other challenges due to inconvenient clinic schedules and locations not easily accessible without reliable transportation (Joseph et al., 2008). One study in New York documented willingness among Mexican migrant workers to participate in a TB screening program. In the program, bicultural health promoters conducted Spanish-language education using skits, demonstrations, and audience participation. Except for chest radiographs, the entire program took place in migrant camps. As a result, 75% of the study participants received a skin test, and 98% of these tests were read. The study concludes that when given the opportunity to be tested in a culturally appropriate and geographically accessible screening program, migrant farm workers will likely participate (Poss, 2000). Many Mexicans want more information about TB, even those who had already received information. Presenting TB information in a familiar, easily understood format increases the chance that the information will be used (Ailinger & Dear, 1998). Although Mexicans have high rates of Spanish literacy, they may not be English literate. Thus, resources in Spanish are likely more useful. In the CDC study, many respondents preferred community talks and public service announcements on the local radio station or on Spanish-language TV channels. Many mentioned the effectiveness of Spanish-language pamphlets. For those with limited literacy, culturally appropriate, Spanish-language videos or fotonovelas may also be an effective way to educate about TB.Perceptions, Attitudes, and Beliefs Lack of transportation can severely hinder receipt of care. Consider alternative strategies, such as offering transportation or transportation tokens. Many Mexicans immigrate for economic opportunities, thus value their jobs highly. TB care that minimizes job interference, such as Saturday hours or extended clinic hours, will more likely be accepted.Suggestion32Promoting Cultural Sensitivity: Mexico Guide Conclusion To meet the challenge of controlling tuberculosis in the United States, the care and treatment of all patients should be appropriate and effective, regardless of country of origin, language, or cultural factors. That entails not only addressing the linguistic and cultural needs of populations with or at risk for TB, but also focusing on the individual's perspective. This guide is intended to provide an understanding of the social and cultural setting from which some Mexican patients may come. It is not meant to stereotype or stigmatize; on the contrary, the authors of this guide fully recognize and appreciate the rich diversity of the myriad groups who have settled in the United States. This guide aims to remind TB care providers that culture does matter in the clinic and that they too bring a cultural perspective to the patient-provider relationship. Providing effective TB care involves taking the time to learn from patients what is important to them personally in the experience of illness and treatment. In the words of Arthur Kleinman, ascertaining \"what is at stake\" for the individual will provide crucial information to use in tailoring the treatment plan. Being \"Mexican\" may not be a significant issue to a patient; being responsible for the care of multiple family members and juggling two part-time jobs without health insurance may. In short, focusing on the patient as an individual and maintaining open, two-way communication will foster effective TB care. If possible, use mobile units to test for and treat TB in communities. Outreach programs that combine services with culturally appropriate education are often more effective among at-risk populations with limited financial resources. When possible, provide tailored information in formats preferred by Mexican patients, namely community talks, public service announcements on TV or radio, or pamphlets in Spanish.Suggestion33Appendix A. Using Kleinman's Questions to Understand Patients' Perceptions of Tuberculosis While this guide encourages a broad understanding of Mexican culture, it is also essential to remember that each individual has personal beliefs. Several methods exist to help health care providers understand how an individual thinks about his or her own health problems. One method is to use a series of questions developed by medical anthropologist Arthur Kleinman (CDC, 1999; Kleinman, 1986). These questions, which have been tailored to tuberculosis (TB) here, can help providers see the illness from the patient's point of view by eliciting the patient's understanding of TB\u2014its name, cause, timing, effects, severity, and treatment. These questions also address the fears a patient may have, how TB may impact the patient, and the effects TB may have on his or her family or friends. Health care providers can use these questions to discuss TB with patients. The questions also can be adapted to address issues related to latent TB infection. These questions may be incorporated into an existing health assessment or an ongoing assessment of a patient's educational needs and treatment adherence. Questions can be reworded in accordance with a patient's cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds. The number and sequence of the questions also can be tailored to the circumstances. Use Kleinman's questions to understand your patients' perceptions of TB. What do you call your illness (the problem)? What do you think causes TB? Why do you think you got sick when you did? What do you think TB does to your body? How severe is your sickness? What kind of treatment do you think you should receive? What are the most important results you hope to receive from this treatment? What are the main problems TB has caused? What do you fear most about TB? How do your family members or close friends feel about you having TB?Suggestion34Appendix B. Tips for Working with Interpreters A good interpreter is able to communicate effectively across cultures and convey important nuances. The most effective interpreters have been trained and assessed for active listening skills and for the ability to extract meaning and use descriptions when there are no language equivalents (CDC, 2006a). Whenever possible, make an effort to match the sex, general age, and social class of the patient and interpreter. In general, avoid using family members as interpreters, especially if sensitive topics are being discussed. An unknown third party may better be able to maintain confidentiality and provide unbiased communication (CDC, 2006a). When communicating through an interpreter, speak slowly and clearly. Use a positive tone of voice that conveys your interest in the patient. Face the patient, not the interpreter. Speak in short units of speech, allowing sufficient time for the interpretation. Avoid medical terminology or professional jargon, as well as slang and idiomatic expressions. Clear, simple, lay language is generally most effective. Encourage the interpreter to translate the patient's words as closely as possible and not to paraphrase, polish, or omit anything that may result in loss of the patient's true meaning. Be aware of nonverbal communication such as silence, distance between individuals, eye contact, emotional expressiveness, and body movements (CDC, 2006a). You may wish to ask the interpreter for clarification of the meaning of any nonverbal cues to be sure you have understood correctly any cross-cultural meaning. Above all, be patient: careful interpretation often takes considerable time.35Appendix C.

Tuberculosis Training and Education Network http://www.cdc.gov/tb/tbetn The T uberculosis T raining and Education Network (TB ETN) was formed to bring TB professionals together to network, share resources, and build education and training skills. Members include representatives from TB programs, correctional facilities, hospitals, nursing homes, federal agencies, universities, the American Lung Association, Regional T raining and Medical Consultation Centers, and other U.S. and international organizations interested in TB education and training issues. TB ETN's Cultural Competency Subcommittee has developed a cultural competency resource list that is available to health care professionals.Appendix C38Appendix D. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Study Summary A total of 50 persons born in Mexico were selected to participate in the 2003 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of tuberculosis (TB). These respondents were distributed among two study sites and involved public TB clinics administered by the state or local health department. The sites were recruited on the basis of local epidemiology, interest, and ability to participate. To elicit a range of responses, both TB patients and people recruited directly from the community (i.e., people who were not patients at the local TB clinic) were included. In the CDC study, sites played an active role in choosing which foreign-born groups to recruit. In general, CDC aimed to include the same group in two sites to facilitate analysis of the influence of local context on participant responses. Although this guide focuses on data from Mexicans, four other groups included in the overall study were Somalis, Vietnamese, Lao Hmong, and Chinese. Study Population and Participant Recruitment In Denver, Colorado, and Atlanta, Georgia (DeKalb County), participants born in Mexico were chosen by the study site staff to participate. This decision reflected the local epidemiological trends, as well as the need for TB-specific ethnographic information regarding this population. This study used a convenience sampling strategy. In addition to country of birth, specific criteria and informal quotas for specific subgroups were identified, with local circumstances determining final sampling. The sample criteria were as follows: Persons aged 18 years or older. Persons residing within the area served by the local health department. Only one respondent per household. Approximately 50% of respondents with fewer than five years' residency in the United States. Participants were recruited either through the community contacts of the bilingual, bicultural researchers (50%) or through recruitment of TB clinic patients by clinic staff (50%). The clinics recruited a balance of patients who 1) had a negative tuberculin skin test, 2) had received a diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI), or 3) had received a diagnosis of TB disease. The combination of quota and snowball sampling strategies was not random, but instead followed methodology appropriate to qualitative research. The demographics and TB status of the Mexican study group are presented in Tables D-1 and D-2.39Table D-2.

Tuberculosis Screening Policies for Persons Overseas Technical Instructions for Tuberculosis Screening T uberculosis screening is required for people overseas who are applying for permanent legal status and for nonimmigrants required to have an overseas medical examination (referred to as \"applicants\"). The Technical Instructions for Panel Physicians summarized here apply to persons from Mexico and supersede all previous Technical Instructions. This summary is adapted from the 2007 Technical Instructions issued by the Immigrant, Refugee, and Migrant Health Branch of the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2007). For more details or questions about the Technical Instructions, please contact CDC's Immigrant, Refugee, and Migrant Health Branch at 404-498-1600. A complete screening medical examination for tuberculosis consists of a medical history, physical examination, chest radiography (CXR) (when required), determination of immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens (i.e., tuberculin skin testing [TST], when required), and laboratory testing for HIV infection (for applicants 15 years of age) and M. tuberculosis (when required). Please see 2007 Technical Instructions at DGMQ's Web site for complete details at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/technica.htm. All applicants <15 years of age require a physical examination and history from a parent or responsible adult who knows the child best. Applicants <15 years of age who are ill and have signs or symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis should have a TST. If the TST is 5 mm, a CXR (anteroposterior or posteroanterior view and a lateral view for applicants <10 years of age; posteroanterior view for applicants 10 years of age) should be performed. An exam shall include three sputum specimens to undergo microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), as well as culture for mycobacteria and confirmation of the Mycobacterium species, at least to the M. tuberculosis complex level, and any laboratory or additional studies that are deemed necessary, either as a result of the physical examination or pertinent information elicited from the applicant's medical history for the panel physician to reach a conclusion about the presence or absence of tuberculosis, but see 42 CFR 34.3(b)(v). Applicants <15 years of age who are a known contact of someone with recently diagnosed tuberculosis and applicants 2-14 years of age living in countries with a WHO-estimated tuberculosis incidence rate of 20 cases per 100,000 population should have a TST. If the TST is 5 mm, a CXR (antero-Any applicant for whom the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis is high enough to warrant treatment for tuberculosis disease, regardless of laboratory results, is considered to have a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Applicants 2-14 years of age living in countries with a World Health Organization (WHO)-estimated tuberculosis incidence rate of 20 cases per 100,000 population should have a tuberculin skin test. Prior receipt of Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination does not change the screening requirements or the required actions based on tuberculin skin test results.43posterior or posteroanterior view and a lateral view for applicants <10 years of age; posteroanterior view for applicants 10 years of age) should be performed. If the CXR findings are suggestive of tuberculosis, the applicant should provide three sputum specimens to undergo microscopy for AFB, as well as culture for mycobacteria and confirmation of the Mycobacterium species, at least to the M. tuberculosis complex level. Applicants 15 years of age require a medical history, physical examination, and CXR. If the applicant has a CXR with findings suggestive of tuberculosis, has signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, or has HIV, the applicant should provide three sputum specimens to undergo microscopy for AFB, as well as culture for mycobacteria and confirmation of the Mycobacterium species, at least to the M. tuberculosis complex level. Applicants should be assigned one or more tuberculosis classifications. The applicant's classification should be recorded on the T uberculosis Classification Cover Sheet. Table F-1 is a listing of the tuberculosis classifications and descriptions. Class Description No TB Classification Applicants with normal tuberculosis screening examinations. Class A TB with waiver All applicants who have tuberculosis disease and have been granted a waiver.* Class B1 TB, PulmonaryNo TreatmentApplicants who have medical history, physical exam, or CXR findings suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis but have negative AFB sputum smears and cultures and are not diagnosed with tuberculosis or can wait to have tuberculosis treatment started after immigration. Class B1 TB, PulmonaryCompleted TreatmentApplicants who were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and successfully completed directly observed therapy prior to immigration. The cover sheet should indicate if the initial sputum smears and cultures were positive and if drug susceptibility testing results are available. Class B1 TB, Extrapulmonary Applicants with evidence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The anatomic site of infection should be documented. Class B2 TB, LTBI Evaluation Applicants who have a tuberculin skin test 10 mm but otherwise have a negative evaluation for tuberculosis. The size of the TST reaction, the applicant's status with respect to LTBI treatment, and the medications used should be documented. Class B3 TB, Contact Evaluation Applicants who are a contact of a known tuberculosis case. The size of the applicant's TST reaction should be documented, if performed. Information about the source case, name, alien number, relationship to contact, and type of tuberculosis should also be documented. * Waivers may be pursued by immigrants or refugees with a complicated clinical course who would benefit from receiving treatment in the United States.Table F-1.
