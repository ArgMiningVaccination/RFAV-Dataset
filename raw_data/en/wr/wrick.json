Crystal healing is an alternative medical technique in which crystals and other stones are used to cure ailments and protect against disease. Proponents of this technique believe that crystals act as conduits for healing \u2014 allowing positive, healing energy to flow into the body as negative, disease-causing energy flows out. According to Dr. Stephen Hawking, the future developments of medicine will depend on treatments based on Light and Colour. Science suggests that gemstones are all about healing with Light and Colour. India is the land of gemstones/ crystals and gem/ crystal therapy and the seers understood the powers of crystals/ gemstones even before modern science took a step towards decoding them. "}
