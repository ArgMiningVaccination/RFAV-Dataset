Addicted? Possessed? Deep Rooted Trauma? Suffering dis-ease? I Can Help! You may have had or heard of 'Acupuncture', which is carried out via piercing the skin with steel needles. That is not what this is! The ancient practice of acupuncture started in China approximately 3000 years ago. The first documentation of acupuncture that described it as an organized system of diagnosis and treatment is in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, which dates back to 100 BCE. Traditionally acupuncture was carried out not with steel needles, but by using stone chards and sometimes bone fragments. This very ancient and alchemical stone medicine, has strong ties to Daoism. Lost to many for centuries I have learnt this unique healing modality that has been passed down through an 88th generation Daoist Master of the Yu Qing Huang Lao Pai (Jade Purity Yellow Emperor Lao Zi School) and the Complete Reality Dragon Gate School. Dating back to the 11th century, these particular teachings integrate spirituality into the practice that is not seen today in modern acupuncture. It is partially the makeup of these minerals, (stones and crystals, that are sadly no longer used in mainstream acupuncture) that bring in the alchemical and holistic aspect to acupuncture, thus leading to much deeper healing than needles alone. What happens? Ancestral Healing, Change Your Epigenetics, Beat Chronic Dis-ease and Generational Curses. I specialise in healing the Ancestral Channels and 'Dragon' treatments. The beauty of working through the ancestral channels is that you usually get a 2 for 1 result, whether you come for an emotional issue, or a physical one, you will usually find both your physical and emotional bodies will improve during treatments. Working with Dragon treatments is about deep clearing of your internal and external demons. The term 'possession' is used to describe any person who does not have full control over themselves, ranging from mild spacey-ness, addictive behaviours or a literal full on entity attachment. This healing modality works using the meridian system and acupuncture points. It is not based in the Chakra system, and therefore is very different to my crystal healing sessions, but with just as great, if not even more powerful results! Depending on your treatment you may or may not be asked to remove certain items of clothing. (unlike crystal healing and crystal therapy where you remain fully clothed the entire time). You will never be completely naked! Lot of blankets will be provided for your comfort and dignity. Everything will be discussed beforehand, so that you can come prepared. Some treatments only require points on the arms and legs, and therefore can be done with you wearing loose clothing. Some treatments require you to lay on your front, and some on your back. These treatments will involve some skin to skin touch. I will measure parts of your hands upon arrival, and then be pressing on certain areas of your body to locate specific points. When these points are marked out, particular crystals will be taped to these points, (via medical tape) they will not pierce the skin, as in acupuncture with needles, however some crystals do have sharp points for accuracy. 20 minute pre assessment session via phone, video call or email 60 + Minute Crystal Acupuncuture session (1 - 2 hours including consultation ) Email of findings Who's it for?
