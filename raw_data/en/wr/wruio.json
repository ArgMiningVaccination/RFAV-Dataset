He sees the demons that cause disease, as well as beings associated with medicinal plants and other substances that can promote health. He has witnessed how demons of disease leave the bodies of the sick and enter the healthy, leading to contagion. Through his therapeutic work, Thoresen has learned that one cannot simply \"fight\" demons, as they merely \"translocate\" to others or return later on. The most effective way to counteract malign entities is to dissolve them through the boundless love of the Christ-being. In the pages of this book, the author presents a lifetime of knowledge\u2014the fruit of more than half a century of practical and clinical experience\u2014offering a better understanding of health and disease. He recounts numerous personal experiences of demonic entities and explains how demons are created. Thoresen offers advice for preventing the demonic effects of natural and artificial radiation, and how we can defend and ultimately free ourselves from demonic influence. A fascinating addendum describes the phenomenon of poltergeists and the spiritual beings related to various drugs. Demons and Healing is a singular work, written through precise vision and knowledge of the spiritual entities that surround us in everyday life. \"Genius is a rare commodity that few of us attain. I see the color magic painted by Van Gogh, hear the music magic of Beethoven, imagine touching the exquisite bronze of Rodin's Thinker. I revere their work but know that I can never create such beauty. So it is with Are's psychic skills.\"\u2014Phil Rogers, MRCVS, Dublin \"Today we have forgotten all about demons and even about Christ. Both concepts have become anachronisms from olden times. That they are not anachronisms is illustrated in the discussions and examples given in this book.\"\u2014Hans Kolstad, PhD, MAS, Norway C O N T E N T S: Foreword by Hans Kolstad Preface Introduction 1.
