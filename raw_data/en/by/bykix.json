Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of levetiracetam in blood is recommended in selected patients at a risk of altered drug exposure, such as pregnant women, renal impairment, drug-drug interactions, elderly and neonates. Testing of saliva could allow an alternative non-invasive, point-of-care TDM approach. Studies have reported the presence of levetiracetam in saliva and correlation between saliva and plasma levetiracetam concentrations. The aim of the project is to: 1) perform a literature review to provide an update on TDM of levetiracetam. 2) develop an analytical assay to measure levetiracetam in saliva on a portable UV spectrophotometer (Nanophotometer NP80, Implen, Germany). A successful method development would lead to an analytical assay validation according to FDA and EMA guidelines. We will collaborate with A/Prof Andrew Bleasel (a neurologist at Westmead Hospital) for this project.

Project 2: Dosing of antimicrobial drugs in special patient populations Co-Supervisors: Dr Hannah Yejin Kim and Dr Sophie Stocker Project Summary: Suboptimal antimicrobial treatment is associated with treatment failure, adverse events and prolonged hospital stay. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a procedure to tailor the dose based on the drug concentration in order to optimise treatment in individual. Patients who often don't respond optimally on a standard antimicrobial dosing regimen like patients in the ICU, patients with renal impairment, obese patients, elderly and neonates may benefit from TDM to facilitate personalised dosing. Retrospective studies are important to describe the problem in a particular setting as results from other hospitals may not be applicable for Westmead Hospital because of a different patient population or severity of disease. Development of easy-to-use saliva-based assays are important for the detection of patients at risk for suboptimal therapy. Several antimicrobial drugs are present in saliva and a correlation between saliva and plasma drug concentrations has been reported. The aims of this project are: 1) a literature review to provide an update on TDM of antimicrobial drugs in a specific patient population. AND one of the following: A. develop an analytical assay to measure the antibiotic concentration in saliva on a portable UV spectrophotometer (Nanophotometer NP80, Implen, Germany). A successful method development would lead to an analytical assay validation according to FDA and EMA guidelines. B. A retrospective study will be conducted in a specific patient population for a selected antimicrobial drug. The aim is to describe treatment outcome and adverse effects in a specific patient population. This will provide opportunity to optimise treatment in patients who need it most.

We are known for our innovative approach, thought -leadership and mentoring of early/mid- career Use of Respiratory Medicines Group: 3 respiratory clinician - researchers, 4 postdoctoral research fellows, 2 PhD students, 1 MPhil student, 1 Honours student Project 1: Respiratory inhalers and the Environment Co-Supervisors: Dr Biljana Cvetkovski (WIMR), Prof Omar Usmani (Imperial College, London, UK), Prof Nicholas Roche ( University Paris Descartes, Paris, France) Project Summary: Over 19 million respiratory inhalers sold to patients in Australia with asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Most of these inhalers are pMDIs (pressurised metered dose inhalers). Over the last few years there has been a global move to pro duce more 'environmentally friendly' inhalers. In 2019 the UK government directed that at least 50% of prescribed inhalers should be of low global warming potential by 2022, recommending that patients using pMDIs be switched to another inhaler type. Switching inhalers is linked to worse disease outcomes and reduced adherence. The aim of this research to explore patient perpectives on inhaler switching, climate change and impact on personalised asthma management plans. Techniques/Methods : Cross -sectional, ob servation study design involving the distribution, analysis and reporting of an online national survey of patients with asthma and COPD. Project 2: Raising the rate of referral for undiagnosed severe asthma patients Co-Supervisors: Dr Biljana Cvetkovski (WIMR), Dr Pamela Alphonse (WIMR) Project Summary: Patients with Severe Asthma require a specific diagnosis and medications. Currently Severe Asthma patients often live with their asthma for many years before receiving this specific diagnosis. This project aims to develop referral pathways by which pharmacists identify patients at high risk of Severe Asthma and refer them to the GP for diagnosis. Before this can be achieved, we need a better understanding of the barriers to early Sever e Asthma diagnosis. This Honours project focuses e xploring the journey of people who have already been diagnosed with Severe Asthma to better understand their path to diagnosis and in particular, their experiences with their medications. Techniques/Method s: Qualitative research methods ie in -depth semi -structured interview with patients with a severe asthma diagnosis. SYDNEY PHARMACY SCHOOL Dr Rose Cairns My research focus is poisoning, clinical toxicology, and epidemiology. I am a Senior Lecturer in the School of Pharmacy, and a practicing poisons information specialist. My overall goal is to reduce harm from poisonings.

Project 1: Evaluating the effect of re- scheduling of cannabis and nicotine on poisonings Co-Super visor: Prof Nicholas Informatics and Digital Health) Project Summary: The TGA has recently changed the scheduling of cannabis/tetrahydrocannabinols and nicotine, in response to increasing demand for access to medicinal cannab is and nicotine vaping products. Cannabis and tetrahydrocannabinols are now Schedule 8, with certain conditions. Cannabidiol is in Schedule 4 and Schedule 3. Nicotine vaping products require a prescription and can now be purchased from pharmacies and impor ted from overseas. It is illegal for other retailers (e.g. tobacconists, 'vape' shops) to sell nicotine vaping products. Scheduling changes alter access to substances, which can have a variable effect on harms, including poisonings, which we have demonstr ated previously. This project will evaluate the impact of re-scheduling on Poisons Information Centre calls. Techniques/Methods : Epidemiology, data analysis & visualisation (NSW Poisons data), clinical toxicology.

Project 2: Methotrexate interventions reduced poisonings and deaths? Co-Super visor: Prof Nicholas Buckley Project Summary: Accidental daily dosing of methotrexate can result in life -threatening toxicity, with death reported from as little as three consecutive days of dosing. From 2004 -15, we identified 92 poisonings and 22 deaths f rom inadvertent daily dosing of methotrexate, with cases increasing in 2014 -15. Following our publication, a range of changes were made to the methotrexate CMI, Product Information, and pack labelling. Alerts were also sent out to medical practitioners and pharmacists. This project will provide an update, with data from 2016 -2021, to see whether these changes have reduced poisonings and deaths from methotrexate.

Projects usually involve patients at Blacktown hospital. -castelino.html#collapseprofileresearchinterest Research Group : 2 PhD students, 2 MPhil students (hospital and community pharmacists), 1 Honours student (nursing) Project 1: Community -acquired acute kidney injury induced by drugs at Blacktown Hospital Co-Supervisor: Dr Connie Van Project Summary: Community- acqui red acute kidney injury (CA -AKI) is a frequent and severe adverse drug reaction (ADR) especially among older patients. Older patients are at a higher risk of AKI than younger patients, due to an increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascula r morbidities, and polypharmacy. Drug involvement is estimated to be present in the occurrence of 20% to 66% of AKI cases. The honours project will retrospectively identify CA -AKI induced by drugs among older patients and explore the clinical characteristi cs of patients with CA - AKI induced by drugs and its risk factors to assess the prevention of AKI. Techniques/Methods : Systematic review; data collection, analysis and interpretation; manuscript writing Selected Publication: Robert L et al Clinical Interventions in Aging 2019:14 2105 -2113 Project 2: Medication complexities and adherence in patients on dialysis and the impact on clinical outcomes Co-Supervisors: Dr Connie Van, Dr Sophie Stocker Project Summary: It is well recognised that patients on dialysis require complex medication regimens to manage multiple disease states. Once commenced on dialysis, the average number of medications is 10 to 12, with an average pill burden of 19 tablets/ d ay. While intended to be beneficial to the overall health of the patient, complicated medication regimens can lead to poor medication adherence and contribute to poor health outcomes. This retrospective study will explore the complexities of medication use in dialysis, impact on medication adherence and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis at Blacktown Hospital.

SYDNEY PHARMACY SCHOOL Associate Professor Betty Chaar My research is about ethical aspects of pharmacy practice. I have led teams to explore issues in many pharmacy pathways and services. From prescribing, vaccinations, abortion etc to euthanasia, there are always new and important issues to investigate and analyse to inform better practices and guidelines for pharmacists. I would like to take the opportunity to explore pharmacists' experiences in the COVID- -health/about/our- people/academic - staff/betty.chaar.html?apcode=ACADPROFILE300808 Project 1: Exploring Ethical Dilemmas in Pharmacy Practice During Covid -19 Co-Supervisor: Professor Bandana Saini Project Summary : This project will seek to explore Australian pharmacists' perspectives and experiences of ethical dilemmas in pharmacy practice during the Covid19 pandemic. Pharmacists have been at the forefront of healthcare throughout the Covid19 pandem ic and have played an enormous role in maintaining continuity of care for patients, sometimes under stressful conditions and shortages. Anecdotally we know that pharmacist have experienced ethical dilemmas, but to date there are no studies documenting this period and its impact on the profession of pharmacy in the future Techniques/Methods : Qualitative study design - semi -structured interviews. Themes emerging will be reported and analysed for recommendations to be formulated. Selected Publication s: Chaar, B., Brien, J., Krass, I.

Project 2: Exploring the role of pharmacists in the supply of Glucosamine - a Pseudo- patient study Co-Supervisor: Dr Joanna Hartnett Project Summary : There are many sources of literature that discuss recommendations about how HCPs should handle requests for herbal medicines or complementary/alternative medicines [CAMs]; e.g. for pharmacy there is a Position Statement by the Pharmaceutical Society of A ustralia that documents certain expectations of pharmacists regarding the supply of CAMS. It is of great importance that pharmacists upskill and address their professional responsibilities in relation to CAMs supply. However, it is not clear if or how any such recommendations have been adopted in the practice of pharmacy in the real world. This \"pseudo- patient\" study will aim to seek a true image of what is happening in pharmacies in Australia regarding CAMs supply, with a specific focus on Glucosamine. The method adopted will be the design of a brief checklist based on recommendations proposed by professional organisations such as PSA and any notable additions from ethicists in the field. The ground researcher will seek to purchase Glucosamine in randomly selected pharmacies around Sydney and use the check list to document the interaction with the pharmacist, if an interaction did occur. Techniques/Methods : This 'pseudo- patient' study will involve the student act as if a patient and request glucosamine at several pharmacies, and immediately document every action taken in the context of this request against a standardised checklist, including an open -ended description of how the 'patient' felt. Data entered will be analysed both statistically and qualitative ly. Selected Publication s: Lee, K.A.; Harnett, J.E.; Ung, C.O.L.; Chaar, B.

SYDNEY PHARMACY SCHOOL Associate Professor Kellie Charles I am passionate pharmacologist that is interested in improving medication safety and health outcomes for patients. My research aims to understand the roles that diverse health teams, and in particular pharmacy students and pharmacists, have in developing t he formation of safe medication management teams and supporting the development of core prescribing competencies in medical students and junior doctors. Contact: kellie.charles@sydney.edu.au Location: Room 500, Badham Building Project 1: The role of inter- professional teams in improving medication safety Co-Supervisor: Dr Carl Schneider Project Summary: Medication safety is a critical international and national health concern as evidenced by the WHO 3rd Patient Safety Call - Medications without harm and Australia's 10th National Health Priority. Inter -professional teamwork and communication is essential for the management of medications throughout the patient journey. Previous literature has shown that inter-professional teamwork has assisted medical students to develop new skills associated with prescribing. Using a mixed methods approach, this project will investigate the how, why and when does inter -professional teamwork improve medication safety within the earliest stages of prescribing competency development. The honours student will evaluate data from the 2021 implementation of the IPL Medication Safety Module and conduct further qualitative interviews with participants in 2022. Techniques/Methods : This research project will involve a mixed -methods approach; quantitative analysis of changes in individual to team medication charts based on medication review and qualitative thematic analysis of in- depth interviews with students about their experience w ithin the team -based medication review and planning. This study will most likely lead to a publication of this 2 year evaluation project. Project 2: Rural versus city - A comparison of how inter -professional teams support the development of prescribing sk ills and medication safety Co-Supervisors : Prof Sarah Hilmer, Prof Peter Carroll Project Summary: Final year medical students and first year interns have frequently reported that they are unprepared for prescribing in real -world practice. This project wil l seek to explore the experiences and perspectives of medical interns at rural hospitals on how inter -professional team helps to develop confidence and competence of medication safety and prescribing skills. These experiences will be compared to those of i nterns from metropolitan hospitals. There are numerous studies that have shown the combination of intra -professional (from senior clinicians) and inter- professional formal and informal learning during the first year of internship is critical for the format ion of safe prescribing confidence and competence. Many of the studies have been conducted in major, tertiary teaching hospitals that have access to higher ward -based pharmacists and other health professionals. It remains unclear how, where and through wh ich mechanisms to rural junior doctors acquire these skills when there are lower ratios of pharmacy support. This project will inform the co -design of a larger research project on how to prepare medical and pharmacy students for rural practice. Techniques /Methods : A mixed- methods approach will be used. Quantitative questionnaires and social network analysis + qualitative in -depth interviews, thematic analysis and realist evaluation.

Project 2: A Snapshot of Pharmacists' Provision of Melatonin Use in Community Pharmacy Co-Supervisors: Dr Yu Sun Bin, Research Fellow, Sleep Research Group, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney; Ms Samantha Lee, School of Pharmacy Project Summary: The recent down- scheduling of prolonged release melatonin as a schedule 3 product means that pharmacists are now directly involved in the counselling and provision of this product to patients over the age of 55. It is unclear how well pharmacists have responded to this recent practice change. As such, this project aims to understand pharmacists' current knowledge about sleep health, the circadian rhythm, and the use of melatonin. Through this pro ject you will design a questionnaire to capture pharmacists' knowledge and attitudes towards the provision of melatonin use in community pharmacy. Findings can potentially shape future training and policies in practice. Techniques/Methods : Cross- sectional survey and univariate analyses. Selected Publication: Abraham, O., Schleiden, L.

SYDNEY PHARMACY SCHOOL Dr Hien Duong Our research is multidisciplinary which focuses on the new concepts and ideas to engineer novel materials and devices at nanoscale. The ultimate goal is to utilize the nanotechnology in the form of nanoparticles to extend our life in two ways: i) early det ection of life -threatening diseases and ii) improvement of their current therapy. Our research area includes polymer synthesis, fabrication and characterization of organic, inorganic and biocompatible nanomaterials for people/academic - staff/hien Research Group : One PhD stu dent, one MPhil student, one Honours student. Project 1: Multimodal nanoparticles to overcome antibiotic resistance Co-Supervisor: Dr Cindy Gunawan, the University of Technology Sydney Project Summary: The rise of hospital -acquired infections, also known as nosocomial infections, is a growing concern in intensive healthcare, causing the death of hundreds of thousands of patients and costing billions of dollars worldwide every year. In addition, a decrease in the effectiveness of antibiotics caused by the emergence of drug resistance in pathogens living in biofilm communities poses a significant threat to our health system. We aim to develop a novel nanostructure -based formulation technology which can overcome antibiotic resistance and facilitate the wound healing in chronic infection. The novelty of this nanotechnology lies in the delivery of triple hits (bacteriophages, antibiotics and nitric oxide) to biofilm -related chronic infection. This formulation is expected to be much more effective than the conven tional single- entity treatment. The ultimate goal is to develop a nanoformulation for chronic infection treatment. Project 2: Peptide PEGylation for the optimal prostate cancer treatment outcome Co-Supervisor: Dr Pegah Varamini Project -IIa (sPLA2- IIa) is overexpressed in almost all human prostate cancer, therefore this enzyme may potentially serve as a biomarker for prostate cancer (Dong et al, 2010). In our previous study, the pentapeptid e, FLSYK (Phe- Leu-Ser-Tyr-Lys) dose- dependently inhibited the activity More importantly, an analogue of cyclic FLSYK (c2) recently entered clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Regi stry, 2019). Although the FLSYK peptide and analogues have been consistently shown to be potent, its low aqueous solubility could hamper any clinical application. Therefore, the aim of this project is to enhance the solubility of these peptides in biologic al environment for the optimal prostate cancer treatment outcome. Our so-called PEGylation approach is to functionalise the peptides with a PEG -like polymer. This polymer greatly assists with colloidal stability (Duong, 2011). We will use two strategies fo r the conjugation: i) peptide will be permanently conjugated to the polymer and ii) peptide will be conjugated to the polymer through a pH -responsive linkage which will be cleaved in mildly acidic conditions at the tumour site. The solubility of the conjug ate will be assessed in comparison with the intact peptides and the activity of the peptide conjugate will be evaluated using prostate cancer cells. The influence of conjugation strategies will also be investigated.

Insert I SYDNEY PHARMACY SCHOOL Associate Professor Ingrid Gelissen I am passionate about the role of nutrition in the development and management of chronic diseases, and have worked in this area from various perspectives, ranging from basic research to nutrition education, over the course of my career. Contact: Ingrid.gelissen@sydney.edu.au Location: S241 -staff/ingrid -gelissen.html Research Group : In 2021 - 2 PhD students and 1 Honours student as primary superviso r; 1 PhD and 1 MPhil student as co -supervisor. Project 1: Pharmacists' attitude towards counselling patients in general nutrition: evaluation of skills, confidence and need for training Co-Supervisor: Dr Joanna Harnett Project Summary : Community pharmacists are often considered the most accessible primary health care professionals. Pharmacists are expected to be knowledgeable about both pharmacological and non -pharmacological lifestyle interventions to prevent and manage a range of med ical conditions. Diet is one of the pillars of lifestyle interventions, and in combination with prescription medications is central to the clinical management of chronic diseases. Overseas studies have found that pharmacists feel they lack knowledge to effectively counsel their patients in general nutrition and diet related topics [1,2]. Our 2021 Honours project showed that final year pharmacy students and interns feel that providing dietary advice to patients is clearly part of their role, however thei r confidence on providing such advice is lacking. The aim of our study is to explore these findings further by conducting in -depth interviews with pharmacy interns and registered pharmacists to provide insights into what skills are lacking and how these c an be improved in a practical and time -efficient manner. The results of this research will contribute to informing educational initiatives that aim to upskill pharmacists with the nutrition knowledge they need to care for people within the communities they practice.

Int J SYDNEY PHARMACY SCHOOL Associate Professor Thomas Grewal Our group is interested in cholesterol metabolism, and how cholesterol- lower ing drugs impact on the progression of neurological disorders and other chronic diseases Contact: thomas.grewal@sydney.edu.au , Tel Mohamed Wahba), 1 Honours (Mai Khnah Linh Nguyen) , 2 international MD students in 2022 Project : Statin use in Parkinson's Disease patients Co-Supervisor: Professor Timothy Chen Project Summary: Cholesterol is a unique molecule essential for cell integrity and critical for many physiological processes. In the brain, de -regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's disease (PD, AD). In the elder ly (>60 years), PD affects about 1% of the population and its prevalence increases with age. Moreover, accumulating evidence points at cholesterol metabolism contributing to PD pathogenesis. In particular, low levels of Low -density lipoproteins (LDL) -cholesterol is widely accepted as a risk factor for PD. While these findings are mostly based on retrospective studies, the use of statins , LDL -cholesterol- lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, have shown therapeutic potential in PD. However, while observational studies associated statins with a 55% reduced risk for PD, several clinical trials rather indicated opposite and even harmful effects of statins in PD patients. Hence, more information on the statin type and dose, over time are needed to better correlate statin medication with PD severity. This proposal explores the relationship between cholesterol and statins in PD severity and progression. We propose to use the pharmaceutical collections databases from the Ministry of Heal th in New Zealand amongst other more specific databases. This pharmacoepidemiological study is an essential next step to identify the impact of cholesterol- lowering statins in PD progression, risk and prognosis. Techniques/Methods : Supervisor A/Prof. T. G rewal has extensive knowledge on de- regulated cholesterol transport in neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. NPC disease (ref)) and most relevant for cholesterol- related aspects in PD. Prof Chen is a renowned researcher in the quality use of medicines and heal th services research. Dr Nishtala, is a leading and experienced pharmacoepidemiologist. This multidisciplinary team will allow the mapping of basic science findings to real world data. This project is an opportunity for students to develop skills on the analysis of epidemiological data sets related to neurodegenerative disorders and provides a unique opportunity to learn more about functioning of multidisciplinatory teams, in a global context, including Australia, UK and New Zealand.

Developing novel antibacterial agents is not the sole s olution to this urgent problem, as targeting the mechanisms that lead to resistance is a new approach to overcoming MDR. Combinations of antibacterials (the carbapenem \u0000-lactams, e.g. meropenem) and agents which inhibit their degradation ( \u0000-lactamase inhibitors, e.g. vaborbactam) and thus overcome resistance, represent 40% of agents currently in clinical development. The antibiotic fosfomycin (FOM) 1, which was approved by the FDA for the treatment of urinary tract infections in 1996, has a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram positive and negative pathogens, good bioavai lability, and very low toxicity. One of the main mechanisms for FOM resistance in Gram negative organisms such as the ESKAPE bacteria, P. aeruginosa , K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter enzymatic drug inactivation by FosA, Scheme 1. (Falagas et al., 2016) Our collaborators have shown that a novel competitive inhibitor of FosA, ANY1 3, potentiates the antibacterial activity of FOM in representative Gram negative pathogens. (Tomich et al., 2019) Techniques/Methods : This project will utilize molecular modelling to identify other agents which inhibit FosA, and thus potentiate the antibacteri al activity of FOM. It will also involve the synthesis and characterization of analogues of ANY1 3. Inhibitors identified by the modelling and / or synthesis will then be tested for FosA inhibition, and potentiation of FOM activity, by our collaborators at the Univ. of Pittsburgh and Emory University.

In response to this need, the Sydney Pharmacy School developed a series of lectures and workshops to ensure pharmacy students received some training in CM. To date, the impact of this training on graduate's experiences, opinions, and confidence towards advising people about CMs has not been examined. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the impact of an evidence -based CM program on graduates' experience, opinions and confidence towards providing CM advice. A systematic search and review of the literature reporting pharmacists' education in complementary medicines will be conducted and will inform the development of a semi -structured questionnaire for use during in - depth interviews and focus groups. The audio- recordings of the interviews and focus groups will be transcribed and a thematic analy sis conducted. The results of this study will inform further improvements to CM content and delivery in pharmacy education. Techniques/Methods : Qualitative design . The student will help with conducting interviews (telephone, focus groups) and performing d ocument and transcript analysis. Selected Publication: Lee KA, Harnett JE, Ung CO, Chaar B.

SYDNEY PHARMACY SCHOOL Professor Jane staff/jane -hanrahan.html Project : Evaluation of the effectiveness of hybrid comp ounding operations (non- closed system and closed system) in preventing surface contamination in an aseptic compounding unit and a chemotherapy day infusion unit Partner: Chris O'Brien Lifehouse Partner contact: Michael Soriano and Matt Roper School mentors: Prof Jane Hanrahan, Dr Jennifer Ong, Prof David Hibbs Project Description: The use of closed system transfer devices (CTSD) in the compounding of cytotoxic infusions have been known to reduce surface contamination of these agents in cancer centres 1,2. In 2020, the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse Day Therapy Unit switched from the ChemoClave Luer -based CSTD system to the ChemoLock Intuitive CSTD system. The Pharmacy Department however compounds our chemotherapy using cytotoxic drug safety cab inets (CDSD) with the aid of ChemoClave vial spikes for some of our products but revert to established safe handling techniques using needles when vial spikes are not suitable. In principle, the pharmacy department uses a semi -closed system for compounding while the Day Therapy unit uses a true closed system when administering chemotherapy. For this study, we want to explore the effectiveness of our current compounding methods in preventing surface contamination during compounding and drug administration an d identify any areas of opportunity to prevent staff exposure to cytotoxic agents. Project aims 1. To assess if surface contamination occurs at the aseptic suite and the day therapy unit with our current compounding and administration methods. 2. To evaluate the efficacy of a true closed system, a semi -closed system and a non- closed system in preventing surface contamination in the pharmacy and day therapy unit.

Developing novel antibacterial agents is not the sole solution to this urgent pr oblem, as targeting the mechanisms that lead to resistance is a new approach to overcoming MDR. Building upon our recent successes in the design and discovery of novel antibiotic adjuvants, this proposal addresses resistance in Gram negative bacteria through the potentiation of fosfomycin (FOM) 1 and the carbapenems, such as meropenem 4. These adjuva nts inhibit enzymes responsible for the degradation of these antibiotics, Fosfomycin resistance protein A (FosA) and the New Delhi Metallo -b-lactamase (NDM -1), respectively, and thus provide alternative and innovative treatment options for nosocomial infec tions which are based upon agents already in clinical use. In this novel approach, repurposed current therapeutics or novel inhibitors which we have discovered , such as ANY 1 3 (a FosA inhibitor [Scheme 1 ]) and the prolines 6 (NDM -1 inhibitors [Scheme 2]), will be utilized to increase the sensitivity of the MDR Gram negative ESKAPE pathogens to FOM 1 or the carbapenems, e.g. 4, respectively. Techniques/Methods : This project will utilize molecular modelling to identify other agents which inhibit FosA or ND M-1. Inhibitors identified by the modelling and / or synthesis will then be tested for potentiation of FOM or meropenem activityactivity, by our collaborators at the Univ. of Pittsburgh and Emory University.

A15, Room S244 Academic Profile: kanglab.net Research Group : Currently 1 MPhil and 1 PhD students Project 1: The personalised polypill: 3D printing to simplify medication taking in older people Co-Supervisor: Dr. Edwin Tan (Sydney Pharmacy School) Project Summary : Over 40% of people aged 65 years and older use five or more medications. Clinically appropriate polypharmacy, although necessary to manage multimorbidity, may contribute to low adherence, pill burden, inaccurate dosing and medication error s. This is particularly problematic in vulnerable patient groups such as those with cognitive impairment and dementia. 3D printing can be used to combine complex medication regimens into a single personalized pill. This can allow for tailoring of drug comb inations, doses and release profiles to suit patient needs, thus improving patient adherence, tolerability and health outcomes. We propose to investigate the feasibility of a personalized polypill using 3D printing technology. Upon completion of this proje ct, we will have a prototype 3D Rx printer to be used in pharmacies to make personalised polypills.

Project 2: A 3D printed human lung model for microparticle character isation and optimisation Co-Supervisor: Dr. Philip Kwok (Sydney Pharmacy School) Project Summary : Inhalation is the main route of drug delivery for asthmatic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and offers several advantages over the oral route. Determining the amount of drug deposited in various parts of our respiratory tract allows for a good correlation to clinical efficacy of inhalation drug devices. However, the aerodynamic particle size distribution measured by cascade impaction with th e pharmacopeial throat does not truly represent the in vivo deposition in the human respiratory tract and provides no accurate in vivo predictions. To establish a reliable in vitro model, the major challenge is the complex structure of the upper respirator y tract. To address this challenge, three -dimensional printing (3DP) can be used. 3DP can accommodate various geometrical outlines and can construction materials. In this project, we aim to build a human airway model by using 3DP. With this model, particul ate drug delivery systems will be tested in vitro .

Previously, we developed new formulation strategies to overcome protein aggregation problem (1, 2). In this project, we will prepare novel mAb formulations and multi -valent influenza vaccine formulations using our new approaches such as ionic liquids and other additives. The study will focus on detecting protein aggregates and split virus induced by heat and/or surfactants in the presence of ionic liquids using various biophysical methods such as fluoresc ence spectroscopy. Mainly, external dye -binding method using a hydrophobic dye will be utilized to probe molecular interactions (3). Techniques/Methods : The student will mainly use UV- Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy methods, but s/he will have an opportu nity to work closely with other group members and learn about other methods. Project 2: Predictive and Screening Methods for the Development of Biologics Co-Supervisor: A/Prof. Serdar Kuyucak (Physics) Project Summary : Therapeutic proteins such as mAbs and vaccines degrade over time mainly due to protein aggregation, making their development, manufacturing and long -term storage difficult. Previously, we developed various predictive methods for candidate and formulation screening, and long -term stability estimation of mAbs and influenza vaccines (3 -5). In this project, we will develop similar predictive and screening methods that can be used for formulation screening and/or comparison of biosimilars and vaccines. The foc us will be detecting small differences, e.g., protein aggregation propensity, between different formulations that are highly similar. External dye - binding method using a hydrophobic dye will be utilized to probe molecular interactions (3,5).

Project: Investigating the safety and efficacy of opioid analgesics Co-Supervisors : A/Prof Danijela Gnjidic, Dr Carl Schneider and Ms Caitlin Jones Project Summary: People who undergo surgery are often administered an opioid analgesic immediately after surgery for pain management. Given the known harms of opioids (e.g. nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, somnolence, c onstipation, risk of long -term use and harm from misuse) it is important that opioid analgesics are only prescribed when the benefits outweigh the harms. There are concerns that opioids are being overprescribed to patients after surgery. This project will investigate the benefits and harms of opioid analgesics administered to people in the immediate post -operative phase after a surgical procedure and provide evidence to guide practice. Techniques/Methods : Systematic review with meta -analysis. As an honou rs student you will be involved in developing the protocol which will be prospectively registered.

Project 1: Effectiveness of deprescribing interventions for gabapentinoids when used for pain: a systematic review Co-Supervisors: Dr Christina Abdel Shaheed, Professor Andrew McLachlan Project Summary: Gabapentinoids (p regabalin and gabapentin) are indicated to treat neuropathic pain in adults and epilepsy. However , they are increasingly prescribed to treat other pain conditions (i.e. \"off label\" prescribing). The increasing number of associated harms, including deaths reported, is a public health concern. When these medicines have been prescribed and the benefits d o not outweigh the harms, the medicine should be deprescribed. However, t here is no consensus nor a clinical guideline on safe and effective ways to deprescribe gabapentinoids . To our knowledge, a systematic review of clinical trials assessing gabapentinoi d deprescribing interventions has not been previously conducted nor registered. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the efficiency of interventions designed to reduce/cease the prescription of, or the use of gabapentinoids when used for pain.

These experiments are forbidden in cosmetic safety assessment in Australia and other developed nations creating an imperative to employ other toxicological assessment techniques. Computational toxicology is already being used in pharmaceutical development and by governmental regulators. In our lab we are d eveloping real -world technologies for toxicological assessment in collaboration with Federal : & Toxicology Laboratory Project : Application of Bayes Theorem to Machine Learning Ames Mutagen Classifiers Co-Supervisor: Associate Professor Helen Ritchie Project Summary: Detection of potential mutagens using computational toxicology techniques is important for public safety in both the chemical regulation and drug development fields. The most widely used in vitro test for mutagenicity in both areas is the Ames test but it is both expensive and time consuming. In Australia there are many thousands of chemicals on the Australia chemical register for which the toxicological profile has never been characterized and the cost of testing them in vitro simply prohibits this. Thus, necessitating the use of computational approaches that can answer toxicological questions both quickly and cheaply. Several computational models of Ames mutagenicity have been developed but room for im provement exists particularly in the area of weight of evidence approaches to classification. Recently a first Bayesian approach paper in this area was published[1] and this project will build on the concept to develop of more systematic and cheminformatic s based approach to application of Bayesian probability to Ames chemical mutagenicity prediction in diverse chemical datasets. The aim of this project is to answer the question \"Would incorporation of a Bayesian approach to mutagen prediction through chemi nformatic grouping of chemicals into chemically selfsimilar groupings yield an index of predictive confidence that correlates with ground -state outomces and hence provide a weight of evidence value for Ames mutagenicity predictions?\" A sub -question is \"Wha t is the most effective similarity index method for chemical grouping in Ames prediction\" (this is a question of intense interest to regulators at the present time). Techniques/Methods: The tools for this project are Python packages for data science inclu ding Scikitlearn, Pandas, RDkit/Mordred and publicly available databases such as the OECD QSAR Toolbox and published databases from Hansen, Benigni, Tinto -Moliner. Databases must be gathered and curated and turned into a canonical SMILES list before being analysed with Mordred to generate chemical information in a two -dimensional grid. This will be analysed with RDkit to generate indices of chemical.

(See refernces below). SetDose is a patented smart syringe system designed to assist caregivers administer liquid medicines accurately. SetDose consists of a mechanical device that can attach to standard syringes. The device accepts a pre -coded card that can control dose volumes. Prototypes have been designed and undergone preliminary accuracy testing and preliminary rounds of user testing with excellent accuracy and positive feedback. M ature embodiment of the prototype via industrial design will be completed by the end of 2021 resulting in 10 prototypes ready for trial. The main aim of this project is to trial this new prototype with users. Techniques/Methods : The first experiment will i nvolve using SetDose attached to a syringe versus other standard measuring techniques such as syringes, measuring cups and droppers to ensure the accuracy of each of the 10 prototypes. This will involve the student making various measurements of different volumes to ensure prototype accuracy and functionality. The next phase will involve a cross over randomized comparative trial with caregivers. In this trial phase we will be using the 10 mature embodiment prototypes in the randomized cross over design tria l followed by qualitative interviews and the administration of the Van Westerndorp w iliness to pay questionnaire . A sample of 100 caregivers will be recruited and undertake a dosing the simulation scenarios. In these scenarios, caregivers will be randomize d to either use the SetDose device or to use their normal dosing technique to assist them measure a common over the counter liquid medicine for \"their child\" (Note, children will not be present however the scenario requires them to simulate their actions d uring this scenario). The accuracy of their liquid measurement skills will be compared, by weighing the content of liquids administered. Participants will then be asked to repeat the task after swapping groups, that is those that used SetDose will now be asked to use their standard technique and those that used their standard technique will then use the SetDose device. A comparison of accuracy measurements will then be undertaken and analyzed. Following the experiment caregivers will be interviewed to gathe r their feedback on the useability and acceptability of the device, as well as asked about their wiliness to pay for such a device using the VanWesterndorp pricing method. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim, and pricing will be plotted.

Project 1: Medication -related goals of care in older adults with dementia Co-Supervisors: Professor Parisa Aslani, Professor Sarah Hilmer Project Summary: Polypharmacy is common in older adults, especially those living with dementia, and is linked with medication -related adverse events, such as hospitalisation. Emerging evidence suggests that aligning deprescribing with a patient's goals of care can be an effective strategy for reducing polypharmacy, as medication -related goals of care can empower individuals to safely self - manage through effective prioritisation and communication of care activities. However, little is known about the types of goals that ol der people living with dementia, and their carers, have for their medications and their health. The aim of this study is to identify the goals of care that older people living with dementia have about their medications and the connection of those goals to their overall health. This review will give insight into the goals and preferences of older people with dementia and inform the development of patient -centred tools to guide medication self - management in older people with dementia.

Project 2: The Mach Project Summary: Older peopl e present considerable variability in the responses to medicines, as they have altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Anticholinergic burden from orally administered medications in older adults is well established, however the systemic effects of inhaled anticholinergic medications, especially in those with polypharmacy and multimorbidity, have not been extensively investigated. The aim of this study is to establish the evidence surrounding the risk of burden from inhaled anticholinergic medications in older adults. This review will determine the types of systemic effects (peripheral and central) reported in the literature (published and grey literature), and the potential impact of anticholinergic inhalers in older adults with polypharmacy and multi morbidity.

To date, our hospital uses oral formulation including capsules and oil containing cannabidiol (CBD), delta -9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and a variety of terpene profiles, however there is still uncertainty about the optimal THC/CBD ratios, dosing, route of administration, and often involves self -titration by the patient. People with chronic pain have shown preference for balanced ratios of THC and CBD or higher levels of CBD, which is relatively less psychoactive compared to THC. Whilst social factors have the potential to influence patient compliance with MC positively (including support from friends and family) and negatively (such as stigma), the fear of addiction, los ing control and acting strangely have also been identified as concerns and patients do want to learn more about MC from HCPs [2,3]. We aim to conduct a retrospective analysis to investigate patient compliance and experience with MC to identify opportuniti es where the pharmacist can bridge information gaps between physicians and patients. The findings from this project will provide insights into MC adoption, further forming the foundation for a pharmacist education program. References: [1]. National Academies of Sciences E, Medicine.

The rationale for this use is to provide a continuous form of analgesia in those who are expected to have severe and sustained pain du ring hospitalization. It is also theorized to mitigate the development of hyperalgesia.5 However, the effectiveness and safety of this approach in the ICU is unknown. In this project, a systematic review will be conducted pertaining to this topic. Data will be extracted from existing lite rature to perform a meta -analysis. This is a literature -based project. The student may be able to attend clinical rounds at RPAH to understand pain management in the ICU and post -operative settings as part of the project.

However, people at early stages of dementia are not always picked up within the h ealth system. Most people aged over 50 do regularly visit their community pharmacy to purchase prescription medications. Pharmacies are good venues for initiating discussions about early -stage dementia given frequent access by those likely at risk and phar macists can review use of alertness impairing medicines. However, whether consumers likely at risk of dementia are willing to participate in pharmacy housed screening/triage program is not known - and exploring will be the aim of this project. Techniques/Methods: We will conduct semi- structured interviews with consumes likely at risk of cognitive dysfunction to map their perceptions about pharmacies as potential screening sites for early signs of cognitive dysfunction in older people . Data analysis will be undertaken using inductive thematic analysis. The results will inform the development of future pharmacy screening services.

Project : Usability testing of evidence -based opioid deprescribing guidelines Co-Supervisors: Ms Aili Langford (PhD Candidate), A/Prof ela Gnjidic, Prof Christine Lin Project Summary: Inappropriate prescribing of opioids is a major international public health problem. There is an urgent need for interventions to reduce opioid prescribing, however, pain can be difficult to manage, and for patients already on opioids, withdrawal of therapy can be challenging. We are developing the first international evidence -based opioid deprescribing guideline, to provide guidance to primary care physicians on when and how to stop opioids. End - user consul tation is integral to ensure acceptability and usability of guidelines. Usability testing is the process of observing users interact with a document to identify human factor design flaws, and assess whether people can find and understand the information th ey need. It has been shown to improve both the retrieval and comprehension of guideline information, as well as enhance clinician performance. The aim of this study is to develop and conduct usability testing of the opioid deprescribing guideline and engag e in an iterative redesign process to ensure that the guideline is an acceptable and useful tool for primary care physicians. Techniques/Methods : Qualitative Interviews : We will recruit a purposive sample of primary care physicians to engage in usability testing, with varying clinical experience and across varying practice settings. Testing will comprise of a semi- structured interview to explore participant's opinions on the content, length, design, and language of the guideline and ascertain per ceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitudes towards using and intentions to use the guideline. We will perform iterative cycles of re - drafting the guideline and re -interviewing participants as necessary (i.e. until no or very minor suggestions for design improvements are identified (data saturation) and participants had an overall positive impression of the guideline). Quantitative Usability Testing : Participants will be asked to complete the System Usability Scale (SUS)1 to rate the usability of th e guideline.

PMID: 30394337 Project 2: Physiologically -based dosing Physiologically (PBPK) models are increasingly used to support paediatric dose selection for small molecule drugs. Most of the models that have been utilised are for small molecules where cytochrome P450 metabolism is the main clear ance pathway. However, there are newer oncology agents such as trametinib and nirapanib that are metabolised primarily through carboxylesterases and limited experience exists with this pathway. This project aims to understand the potential differences in pharmacokinetics in paediatric subjects due to the ontogeny of drug elimination with a focus on carboxylase metabolism. This work will be done through a literature review and may apply the use PBPK modelling and simulation to understand impact on a real ex ample where model parameters can be derived from the literature. Other factors that will also be evaluated will include rate of organ maturation, blood flow, body composition and ontogeny of transport mechanisms.

Heart failure is a complex syndrome requiring multiple drug therapies to provide symptom relief, prevent hospitalisation and reduce mortality. Complex drug regimens increase the chance of patient confusion, non-adherence to medicines as well as unwanted side effects.

My research interests are particularly focussed in the improved delivery of established medicines and the drug delivery applications of macrocycles and nanoparticles. I also maintain an interest in the development of cannabis as a pharmaceutical product. Contact: wheate.html Project 1: use by Sydney -based patients Co-Supervisor: Ms Elise Schubert Project Summary : In 2016, the Australian government changed the scheduling of cannabis from S9 to S8 for medical purposes; however, while the rest of the whole treats cannabis as a herbal and complementary medicine, Australia has taken an approach of treating medicinal cannabis as a pharmaceutical product, the same as all other medicines. This means that cannabis -based dosage forms must be manufactured to exact specifications, and before a product can be placed on the Austra lian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) it must have undergone clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy. However, even before a product is placed on the ARTG it can be available to patients through an Authorised Prescriber or through Special Ac cess Scheme - B. Patients who access medicinal cannabis in these ways may do so for diseases and conditions for which efficacy has not yet been proven, and where an ideal formulation and dose has not yet been determined. As such, there is likely to be variance between patients. In this project the student will work collaboratively with Cannabis Access (CA) clinics and Applied Cannabis Research (ACR) to analyse patient data that has already been collected by via the CACOS project to examine aspects of effica cy, side- effects, drug -drug interactions, and reduced used of other medicines. The exact nature of the disease/condition to be analysed, and the goals of the analysis, will be decided closer to the selected student's start date. Project 2: Development of a slow -release formulation of meloxicam for the treatment of chronic pain in koalas Co-Supervisor: Associate Professor Merran Govendir (University of Sydney Veterinary School) Project Summary: Like many animals, koalas can be affected by inflammation and chronic pain. Unfortunately, because of their eucalyptus -based diet, they also hyper -metabolisers. As such, slow-release formulations of medications are needed to provide a continuous supply o f drug. Working in conjunction with the University of Sydney Veterinary School the student will develop and test slow -release injectable formulations of meloxicam. The project will require the student to undertake laboratory -based research utilising knowl edge learnt across many pharmaceutical science units of study. The student will prepare formulations from different solvents and determine their drug release profiles in simulated blood serum. In doing so, the student will need to become competent in pharm aceutical calculations and data analysis. But students will develop these skills as part of the research and do not need to already consider themselves experts in calculations and analysis. There is the potential for the student to be involved in the anim al testing of their formulations with the vet school.

Up to 50% of patients develop metastatic disease that has a poor survival of <18 months. By screening natural compounds and their derivatives that are available in our laboratory, we will identify potential drug candidates with activity against human UM cells and UM metastasis. It is expected that these compounds target specifi c cellular organelles to exert their anti -cancer effects. In this project we will use a range of modern molecular and biochemical approaches to define the detailed mode of action of these candidate molecules in combating UM growth and invasion. The molecul ar targets for these candidate compounds in UM will be identified. This study will utilize established UM cell lines and primary UM tumor -derived cell cultures that represent a unique resource available to our group. The findings from this project will pr ovide critical pre- clinical data to justify the therapeutic application of the natural compounds or their derivatives as potential treatments for UM.
