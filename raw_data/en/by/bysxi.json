Acne scars can be a major irritation to those who suffer from them, for several reasons. They are a painful reminder of an annoying condition. Many people prefer to use natural remedies to help clear up the appearance of acne scars. However, the science behind these remedies is unclear. Some of these natural treatments may cause further irritation or additional problems, so it is advised to use them with caution. It's worth keeping in mind that \"natural\" doesn't always mean better for your skin. These methods aren't proven nor have they been approved by skincare scientists so be aware of things like irritation or soreness, and stop using them if you experience any of these symptoms. IS NATURAL ACNE SCAR REMOVAL POSSIBLE? Scars may naturally fade slightly over time, but they will likely not disappear completely without treatment. Natural treatments may have some benefits for superficial and minor scarring, however, for deep skin lesions and scarring, they may cause more harm than good. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF ACNE SCARS? It is best to be aware of the type of scarring that you're trying to remove. Treatment options that are suitable for addressing the issue may vary depending on the type of [acne scarring](https://www.stratumclinics.com/conditions/acne/) you have. There are three main types of acne scars: Hypertrophic scars These scars occur when the skin has produced too much collagen to heal acne wounds and causes a mass of raised tissue on the skin. It can be itchy and tender. Atrophic scars These scars appear as small indentations and develop when there's a loss of skin tissue. - Icepick scars are usually small noticeable scars that look like pinpricks. - Boxcar scars are larger indentations with clear edges. - Rolling scars have unclear edges and give the skin a rolling or uneven wavy appearance. Keloid scars These scars are similar to hypertrophic scars but they tend to be thicker than the original acne spot. These often cause the affected scarred area of skin to darken which increases their appearance in relation to the surrounding skin. They may be red or brown and also may be itchy or painful. Are there any natural acne scar removal remedies to try at home? Apple Cider Vinegar Diluted apple cider vinegar may help reduce the appearance of acne scars. However, make sure the solution is diluted well. Concentrated apple cider vinegar can cause severe burns and further harm the face. Turmeric Powder Turmeric Powder has anti-inflammatory properties and can be great for reducing bacterial growth. It also helps skin regeneration and reduces scarring. Coconut oil Studies have reported that coconut oil moisturises your skin and prevents acne scars. Keep in mind that if you have extremely oily skin, you should avoid this option as it may worsen the situation. Use cold-pressed coconut oil for this condition. Tea tree oil This is a product derived from a tree in Australia that possesses antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Spot application of oil on the face may help clear bumps and even reduce scarring. Lemon Juice Lemon contains natural exfoliating acids that can stimulate cell renewal. While we do not recommend applying raw lemon juice directly onto your skin, you could consider adding it to a homemade face mask. Lemon Juice is rich in sugars, vitamin C and citric acid, although there is a high likelihood it will irritate the skin if you have particularly sensitive skin. Manuka Honey Applying Manuka honey is a good option, as it has great anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. For dark marks and pigmented skin, apply apple cider vinegar with a cotton bud to the scar, and apply the honey straight afterwards to help soothe the area. Acupuncture Acupuncture can be a very effective treatment for scarring as it increases circulation to the area, helping to reduce inflammation as well as stimulating collagen production. This encourages better tissue regeneration, helping to diminish the appearance of acne scarring. It is advised to consult a dermatologist or health care professional first before using this treatment.
