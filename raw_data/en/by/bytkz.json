I eventually fell into a depression from the misconception of a lack of hope I had for my situation and the future. As things remained difficult, the symptoms of my mental state began to kick in. I was staying in bed all day, had low energy, and had no motivation to cook food or leave my home. Feeling stuck with no way to escape, I visited a specialist doctor searching for answers. He was patient with me and even gave me a guidebook about how to cope with depression. My doctor asked if I felt worse when I first get up or through the day. I told him that I felt horrible in the morning, and go slowly better through the day. This answer showed him that my irregular emotional state was due to a chemical imbalance as opposed to a psychological one. After I read the book and learned about different depression-coping methods, I decided to try being more accountable for my day. I called a few of my friends and asked them to help keep me accountable. However, everyone was pretty busy and could not help me as much. There was one friend that I reached out to who was determined to help me recover. She was able to call me every day just to have a simple conversation and help me leave my home sometimes. Additionally, I started doing acupuncture to help regulate my emotional imbalance and help me feel more revitalized when I wake up in the morning. Acupuncture can help to improve your mood and motivation, stimulating the production of \"happy hormones\". Slowly but surely, I started to get back on track by making little changes every day and with the support of my dear friend's consistent help and care. There are three maintawayas I'd like you to keep in mind from my battle with depression: 1. We need good, reliable friends to support us on our mental and physical health journeys. Only with the support of our peers can we break away from our isolation and know we are not facing our problems alone. 2. We should not be judgemental about people with depression; it is not laziness, boredom, or attention-seeking behaviour. Experience has taught me that it is an internal struggle that is truly hard to deal with and greatly impacts everything else in your life. 3. Acupuncture can aid in balancing the chemical imbalance of the body which can result in several different issues. The severity of my depression was greatly mitigated through the use of acupuncture to reset my emotions and provide me with the foundation to begin healing. If you are struggling or know someone else who is battling depression, know that you are not alone and that there are people and solutions that can help you just as they have helped me.
