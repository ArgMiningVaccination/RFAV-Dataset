Patients with heart disease, including those with congestive heart failure and ischemic heart disease, may either realize unique benefits or suffer life-threatening complications from alternative therapies. That makes well-designed clinical trials of these treatments' safety and efficacy mandatory for optimal therapeutic strategies. A thorough understanding of the spectrum of therapies, from biochemical mechanisms of herbal remedies to intangible \"noetic\" medical therapies with no known mechanism--such as healing touch, distant healing, and prayer--is an area of growing research activity and funding potential. The complementary and alternative medical (CAM) research laboratory studies such therapies and their: - Mechanisms of activity - Clinical outcome - Impact on quality of life - Cost-effectiveness In 2005, the laboratory led the first multi-center, prospective, randomized trial of distant intercessory prayer and bedside music, imagery, and touch therapy (MIT). Other research examples include: - Study of the biochemical mechanisms of herbal remedies - Measures of physiologic response to biofield therapies - An NIH-funded randomized study of chelation therapy The laboratory offers cardiovascular medicine fellows the opportunity to gain mentoring and experience in CAM practices in cardiology settings through their exposure to and participation in such research.
