[Magical Overview of the Event](#2023vpm) [Attend Will Fuel Your Too Busy to Visit the Virtual Pagan Monastery?](#2023vpm8) [Anyone Can Find Power in the Virtual Pagan [Going Can Happen Fast](#2023vpm12) Magical Overview of The Virtual Pagan Monastery 2023 to fifteen-minute-long ceremonies three days a week at my Fairy monastery. In each brief meeting, you enter a mystical environment that quickly centers you into power and serenity. If that seem impossible\u2014because, for example, you're dealing with trauma\u2014my students will tell you I deliver on my promises. Plus, the rituals also help manifest your pivotal material and spiritual goals. You get this three times a week without spending a lot of time. Ongoing re-centering, ongoing miracles. We will cast old-fashioned magical spells for prosperity, serenity, the ability to serve with our precious gifts, or your other goals. and outrageous joy, our spirits held safe by Fairy Gods. our hearts and strength renewed with the ability to reach cherished goals. we can return to our Faerie sanctuary to walk the stars again and find the power we need to meet the hours ahead, triumphing with joy. Definitions if you're new to my work: *Witchcraft and Shamanism are synonymous in my tradition. Ask me why if you want. * Ditto spells, rituals, ceremonies, meditations, etc. * All the magic I teach is Fey, whether described as such or not. Think of the Virtual Pagan Monastery as a haven hidden in Faerie realms, or a Goddess temple, Druid grove, unusual monastery, or whatever feels right to you. It is where we find power to fulfill longings. Love, money, health, serenity, self-love, and other desires. It is a sanctuary and joy, even in the hardest times. [Paganism needn't lack contemplative aspects to remain wild and free. Inner adventures fuel my passion for life. Ritual moments between the stars nourish and give joy like few things ever could.](https://stardrenched.com/pmsidebarsm/) Plus for my outward efforts to be effective and loving, I need an inner life. For example, the mystical planes are where I perform magical spells to succeed on the worldly plane. I needed new terms to depict monastic spirituality that liberates instead of oppresses. The devotional practices, contemplations, and shamanic rites I channel for the Fairy monastery are not dour, overly formal, or anti-sex. I created the term ecstatic contemplative to describe folks like me. I also coined Pagan monasticism to expand the sense of spirituality. Ecstatic contemplations in the Pagan monastery free us from subjugation and give us the magical and worldly powers to live wild and free. Attend by Phone. It's Easy!

Three Master-of-the Arts Magics Will Fuel Your Success The enrollment price is a great bargain. I do a lot to help you accomplish a lot. Here are three Master-of-the Arts magics I bring to the monastery: 1) Oral Tradition Faerie Rituals Three Times a Week I use master-level shamanic techniques to create ceremonies safe for beginners and substantive enough for adepts. Enrollment is limited so we can work in oral tradition, in which immense headway happens quickly. Fairy oral-tradition magic works only in small groups. 2) I Cast Spells For Your Success Three times a week, for the entire three months, I cast spells for you to achieve goals. Here's how: Each meeting, you receive direct spiritual transmissions. Spiritual transmissions are a method I use to give you good luck, add power to your efforts to improve your life, and strengthen the magic of our rituals. The transmissions also adapt to meet your needs, e.g., money, soul healing, physical health, opportunities to express your wild heart, or relief from pressing spiritual challenges such as despair. 3) One-on-One Shamanic Support by Phone I'm available if you have concerns to discuss privately. Or, if you have a question that'd take too long to answer during a group ceremony, you can call. Someone might think, \"I won't get much from 15 minutes.\" But Francesca's Pagan Monastery showed me how deep a 15-minute ritual can go. She knows how to do this.\u2014Jenelle Campion Life-changing. I don't have words adequate to thank you. ... One of the most deeply meaningful experiences of my life.\"\u2014Melissa \"I am truly blown away at how much I was able to resolve and heal.\"\u2014Chad Woodward Cost for three months of rituals, transmissions, and one-on-one support: $200 a month. Feel Too Busy to Visit the Virtual Pagan Monastery? If you have to miss a lot of sessions, it'll still work. For one thing, the rituals are set up so that, if you can't attend all the meetings, you won't miss instructions or continuity needed for the rituals you can attend. For another, you benefit from every meeting because I give you a spiritual transmission whether you're at the meeting or not. [I support you in your life circumstances and frame of mind.](https://stardrenched.com/2021/03/05/2021-fairy-witch-training/fwtaccnt2/) I'm charging less than I might for the amount of work I'll do. This way, you have the yummy option of coming to all of the rituals but can miss some without wasting money. Show up when you can, even if it's only half of the sessions. Another reason to not worry about time: When I'm not centered in my Gods' love for me, I lose far more time than three fifteen-minute rituals a week. I waste hours on * worry * obsession * time-robbing habits like too much social media * ineffective solutions that leave me battling problems endlessly. In ancient shamanic culture, tribes were busy\u2014hunting, weaving, etc.,\u2014and even more so during crisis. They didn't shoulder on without group rites. Sacred group meetings were part of the everyday. Grab this opportunity for immense blessings. This is the second Virtual Pagan Monastery group I'm leading in 2023 because there's been an even greater need for it than usual. I tend to open the monastery briefly for visits only once a year and, in fact, it had not been open to visits in three years. Anyone Can Find Power in the Virtual Pagan Monastery The Fairy Gods stand with us against hierarchy. Anyone can visit the Virtual Pagan Monastery and get a lot out of it\u2014beginner, adept, monastic, non-monastic. I facilitate our circles with easy-to-understand, step-by-step magical instructions. Ongoing Empowerment Continual spiritual sustenance: fifteen-minute-long ceremonies, three times a week for three months. It can be hard\u2014if not near impossible\u2014during crises or other busy times to spiritually tend to oneself, but the virtual monastery is a quick way to do it regularly. Ongoing spellcasting: rituals three times a week to create and maintain success, luck, and wholeness. A happy life requires care. Repeatedly, we need to regain emotional balance, experience spiritual renewal, and create positive outcomes. Enrolling in this event might be one of the most important actions you take. If you need to miss some sessions, enroll. Perfect attendance isn't always real life. These special visits to the monastery are a chance to continually center into your wisdom, truths, and power, and to remain in a flow of good luck. I need miracles often if not daily. Visits to the Pagan monastery keep miracles happening. For example, magic washes away doubt and pain, replacing them with confidence, peace, and success. Every visit is pure magic. Going It Alone Even if you know how to do rituals, it might be hard to fit them into your week because it takes time to do them, let alone create or choose the right ones. Plus willingness to consistently take care of oneself can be weak when on one's own. You needn't go it alone. I'll lead you in rituals. One reason I open the monastery to visits is so that I have to show up three times a week to hang out with beautiful people and my sweet Gods. We all need fellow travelers. Fairy Gods Create Miracles Their magic is so strong that fifteen minutes improves your life. You emerge from each brief session more able to cleave to your path, do what's needed to achieve goals, stay centered, take maximum advantage of opportunities, and overcome challenges. Don't take my word. Trust your gut. It might say that I excel at facilitating fifteen-minute shamanic experiences that are relevant, extraordinary, and miraculous. (If my self-praise seems overly bold: Mom told me to let everyone know how good I am at what I do because no one else was going to say it enough.) If You Think You Have No Time to Visit the Monastery Whether happily swamped with efforts toward fabulous goals, or consumed with holding your head above water, enroll. Here's why: Without the sophisticated, effective magics we will do, you might waste a lot of time going down rabbit holes. Instead, the rituals help keep your life and thoughts streamlined, focused on what you need and want. When I commit my time to something important, even if I don't know how I'll be able to fit it in, the Gods make it work for me. You'll be able to fit in 15 minutes often enough. Miracles Can Happen Fast With the ancient Fairy Gods by us, we're unstoppable. The Old Gods are miracle makers so They accomplish a lot quickly. My shamanic methods have conquered challenges that should've killed me, and have freed me from inner and outer limits. They can do the same for you. They give you spiritual and worldly power to have a happy life, no matter how large, complex, or sophisticated your challenges and goals. I've never met anyone too successful materially, spiritually, or magically to not profit in major ways from my work. Recoup, regroup, restart. Every day is new and offers miracles. "}
