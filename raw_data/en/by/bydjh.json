Hence as editors and as a publisher we encourage the publication of studies that replicate or refute work we have previously published. We work with authors (through communication with the corresponding author) to publish corrections if we find parts of articles to be inaccurate. If a paper's major conclusions are shown to be wrong we will retract the paper. By doing so, and by being open about our motives, we hope to clarify once and for all that there is no shame in correcting the literature. Despite the best of efforts, errors occur and their timely and effective remedy should be considered the mark of responsible authors, editors and publishers. There's a lot we applaud in this editorial, particularly that \"there is no shame in correcting the literature.\" We suspect that the \"[i]f a paper's major conclusions are shown to be wrong we will retract the paper\" will be more controversial. We'd urge you to [read the entire editorial](http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2012/09/25/the-role-of-retractions-in-correcting-the-scientific-literature/), and of course let us know what you think.
