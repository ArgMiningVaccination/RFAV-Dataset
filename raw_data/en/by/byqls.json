[Are you thinking of becoming an egg donor??](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/beach-1368021_640.jpg) Summer is upon us and the time to vacation is here with lots of warm and sunny places to be explored. If you are thinking of donating your eggs DO NOT TRAVEL to any area with possible ZIKA virus exposure. Doing so will exclude you from being eligible to donate your eggs. Areas of exposure are updated frequently on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website through the following link: [http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html). If you are thinking of having an Intrauterine Device (IUD) placed as a form of birth control, choose one that is non-hormonal such as a PARAGARD \u00ae. IUD's that release hormones (such as the MIRENA \u00ae) would need to be removed in order to donate your eggs. You can always call us to find out if the IUD you have or are thinking of having placed would allow you to go through egg donation. Our Egg Donor Program Coordinator Pam Hutchens, RN, is a wonderful resource for all of your questions. Reach our Egg Donor Program directly at 1-248-622-2877.
