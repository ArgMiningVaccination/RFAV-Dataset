Essential roller essential oils I love this oil it smells beautiful and doesn't affect my skin. Iv been using this oil for 2 years i love the smell too beautiful product. Heavenly scent This Athena scent is so gorgeous! I have been looking for a perfume-esque natural scent for ages to get away from all the nasties. This oil is amazing, the scent is stronger than others I have tried but not overpowering and it lasts for ages! Plus the blend is just absolutely delicious. Thank you for such a stunning product! LOVE! I recently purchased this product from Market Organics and I'm so in love with the aroma. It takes me back to certain places and memories. Just adore it and use it daily. Lovely products & a free surprise I love these oils. Everyone always comments on how amazing I smell. When it arrived it was in a super cute little box with a pouch and to my surprise they put an extra one in for me!!! Thank you x Self Love Athena is a uniquely gorgeous scent which makes me think all things love. When I'm feeling down or having trouble sleeping I roll Athena on my wrists and chest. As I take a deep breath in I'm able to unwind and go to my happy place. "}
