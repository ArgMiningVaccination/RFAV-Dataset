Aromatherapy has been shown to reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting and thus could be used as a complementary therapy to antiemetic drugs; however, no studies have considered the exclusive use of Lavender in these patients. The study's aim is to assess aromatherapy in reducing nausea and vomiting in post-operative patients. Materials and Methods: A 2-arm randomised controlled interventional study was carried out in the Neurosurgery, General Surgery, Vascular Surgery, and Gynaecology facilities of the SS Antonio e Biagio e Cesare Arrigo Hospital of Alessandria. Study inclusion criteria: patients over the age of 18, who sign an informed consent form, have had an anaesthesiologic examination, have had general anaesthesia, and are clinically stable with a nausea score of NRS>0. Multiple instruments will be used, including a numerical rating scale, a Likert rating scale, and a Likert rating scale to assess Vomiting and the degree of satisfaction. Conclusions: The use of complementary non-pharmacological methods such as aromatherapy may help patients feel more comfortable in the post-operative period.", "sitename": "Working Paper of Public Health", "date": "2023-03-31", "cleaned_text": "Evaluation of the effectiveness of an aromatherapy treatment with lavender essential oil to reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting: study protocol of a randomised controlled trial Accepted: 1 March 2023 All claims expressed in this article are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of their affiliated organizations, or those of the publisher, the editors and the reviewers.
