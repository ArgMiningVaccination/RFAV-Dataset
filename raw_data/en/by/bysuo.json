A boxing diet plan is grounded in clean eating and consuming foods that fuel the body. Boxers achieve peak physical shape through exercise and diet. Starting a boxing diet and exercise plan is easy and yields results quickly. Beginners will feel the difference in body and mind, and in just a few short weeks, they will see a more toned, stronger physique. If you're trying to figure out how to start a New Year diet that you'll be able to maintain, learn how to eat like a boxer. What Is a Boxer's Diet? A boxing diet consists of whole, nutritious foods in the proper proportions, consumed at the right times. Boxing nutrition includes these three (3) main food groups: 1. Complex Carbohydrates Examples: Whole grain breads/pastas, fresh fruit, rice, oats, potatoes 2. Lean Proteins Examples: White meats, lean red meats, fish, low-fat dairy 3. Healthy Fats Examples: Nuts, avocado, fish, olive oil While these three groups should ideally be included in every meal, the proportions of these foods change before a workout and after a workout as the needs of the body change. More carbohydrates are needed before a workout to provide energy, whereas more protein is needed after to restore the muscles. So what do boxers eat and can incorporating a cutting diet plan actually work? Let's read on to find out more. How Many Meals Do Boxers Eat? Professional boxers will usually eat at least three (3) meals a day and up to five (5) or more when training. Snacks are very important to keep energy levels stable and keep you feeling satiated. Protein shakes are excellent to give the muscles a quick recovery boost after a particularly intense workout and don't take much time to prepare. Don't forget the importance of hydration - boxers should drink at least one gallon of water per day. What Is a Boxing Diet Plan? The best way to get an idea of the kinds of foods to include in a boxer's cutting diet plan is to look at a sample meal schedule like this one-week plan here: 1 Week Sample Meal Plan [Four (4) Training Days] *Food suggestions and pairings.
