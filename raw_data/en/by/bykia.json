There are a number of viruses which can cause viral hepatitis from hepatitis A to hepatitis E, and the viruses can be contracted in different ways. Some variants of hepatitis have vaccines such as hepatitis A and hepatitis B. The more concerning types of viral hepatitis are those that cause chronic liver disease, namely hepatitis B and C and in some cases hepatitis D which can complicate hepatitis B. How is hepatitis diagnosed? Viral hepatitis is essentially diagnosed by abnormalities in the liver enzymes. Where abnormalities in the [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) are seen and are confirmed by [viral serology](http://clinicalvirology.stanford.edu/serology.html) which will be able to identify the virus that is causing the viral hepatitis. There are a number of investigations that could also be undertaken to investigate the hepatitis virus further outside of laboratory tests, such as ultrasounds scans, [FibroScans](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-articles/why-see-a-hepatologist-liver-specialist), and in some cases, liver biopsy.
