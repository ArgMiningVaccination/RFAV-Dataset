It's a fact: you want the best for your baby. If your baby is breastfeeding, you look for ways to keep [yourself healthy](https://www.mustelausa.com/blogs/mustela-mag/the-healthiest-breastfeeding-diet) so your little one stays healthy too. If they're bottle-feeding or eating solid food, you read every label to ensure that your baby is getting all the nutrients they need.

For that, you should be applauded. But one thing parents sometimes forget to consider is what's in [their baby's skincare products](https://www.mustelausa.com/blogs/mustela-mag/baby-skin-care-the-complete-parent-s-guide). They see a phrase like care,\" \"natural skin care,\" or \"clean skin care\" on the label and assume it must be OK \u2014 without looking at the ingredients. For example, do you know what the ingredients are in your little one's cleanser, lotion, or diaper rash cream? Honestly, we can't blame you if you don't. It would take a chemistry textbook to understand most of them. \"But wait,\" you protest, \"if the label says 'all-natural' or 'organic,' doesn't that automatically mean it's safe and non-toxic?\" Unfortunately, it's a little more complicated than that. The experts at [Mustela](https://www.mustelausa.com/) are here to give you the facts about organic, natural, and clean skincare products. We'll also explore the differences between the three and see what it means for you and your baby. Organic vs. Natural vs. Clean Skin Care: What's The Difference? Organic Skin Care The basic meaning of the word organic is \"grown or raised without chemicals or pesticides.\" This concept became popular in recent years because of the demand for farm-to-table foods. What does that have to do with skincare products? The term \"organic\" refers to the way a plant is grown, and it's important to know that info about the plants that make their way into [your lotion](https://www.mustelausa.com/collections/organic/products/organic-hydrating-cream-with-olive-oil-and-aloe) or [your baby's diaper cream](https://www.mustelausa.com/collections/organic/products/diaper-cream-with-olive-oil-and-aloe)! The organic ingredients in your skincare products don't have the pesticide and chemical residues that their non-organic counterparts have. That's good! However, \"organic\" by itself tells you nothing about the other chemicals or ingredients that are added to your skincare products. In other words, it doesn't reveal how much of an organic product is actually organic. In fact, according to the [USDA](https://www.ams.usda.gov/grades-standards/organic-labeling-standards), the term can be used to label any product that contains at least 95% organic ingredients. So up to five percent of a product's ingredients may not be organic even in that product labeled as such! That's why only looking for an \"organic\" label is not enough. The good news is that the organic skincare trend opened the eyes of many consumers. These consumers then began demanding more natural ingredients overall. Natural Skin Care Natural skin care implies that a product is formulated with chemical-free ingredients. Unfortunately, the skincare industry isn't well-regulated and the \"natural\" label isn't perfect. As long as a product contains some plant-derived ingredients, companies can label it as natural. But that product may also include man-made chemicals. While naturally derived ingredients are great, the other important thing to remember is that not all synthetic ingredients are harmful. Many man-made chemicals are just as safe, if not safer, than some natural ingredients. Add to that the fact that some natural ingredients can be just as harmful as synthetic ingredients (take mercury, for example), and you can start to see why there's so much confusion. Because of the uncertainty surrounding natural vs. unnatural and safe vs. unsafe, consumers began searching labels for ingredients they recognized. That gave rise to the idea of clean skin care. Clean Skin Care [Clean skin care](https://www.mustelausa.com/blogs/mustela-mag/clean-skin-care-vs-vegan-skin-care-everything-you-need-to-know-for-your-baby) is about safety over source. These products often contain both [natural](https://www.mustelausa.com/blogs/mustela-mag/the-top-9-natural-skin-care-ingredients-for-your-baby) and man-made ingredients, but nothing damaging. \"Clean\" means that the [liniment](https://www.mustelausa.com/liniment) you use on your baby's diaper area \u2014 or the [cleanser](https://www.mustelausa.com/collections/routine) you bathe with \u2014 is free of harmful chemicals. In other words, it's the difference between an exfoliator with safe and helpful synthetic acids such as alpha hydroxy acid, lactic acid, and salicylic acid, and an exfoliator that contains the harmful and carcinogenic 1,4-dioxane. While the second exfoliator may be more reasonably priced, it can put both you and your baby at risk. That's why we at Mustela are committed to providing only the safest products for you and your family. We go beyond current cosmetic safety standards to offer organic, natural, and clean skincare products that are both effective and safe to use \u2014 even for newborns and [breastfeeding](https://www.mustelausa.com/breastfeeding-tips/) moms. When choosing skincare products for you and your little one, keep in mind that clean is a mindset, not a definition. There are no regulations governing which ingredients to include and which to leave out, so you have to examine the labels of all your skincare products yourself. Now, let's talk about what to look for. What's In Your Skincare Products? When you read the label on [your baby's daily lotion or the hydrating cream](https://www.mustelausa.com/products/hydra-bebe-body-lotion) you use twice a week, you'll see some ingredients you recognize and some you don't. Which ones are safe and which ones aren't? We can't list every ingredient you'll ever see, but we can reassure you that things like water, beeswax, zinc oxide, avocado perseose, sunflower oil, and glycerin are perfectly safe. But many skincare products contain unsafe ingredients, including (but not limited to): [Parabens](https://www.mustelausa.com/blogs/mustela-mag/are-parabens-safe-for-you-and-your-newborn) - Phthalates hydroxytoluene (BHT) - 1,4-dioxane For instance, did you know that parabens and phthalates disrupt hormone production? Or that formaldehyde and 1,4-dioxane can cause cancer? Why are harmful ingredients like these allowed in skincare products? Because of the lack of skincare industry regulations we mentioned before. Manufacturers can get away with including dangerous ingredients in their products by classifying them as \"inactive ingredients\" or as \"fragrance.\" Take BHT, for example. BHT is a preservative that extends the shelf life of products from a few weeks or months to almost a decade. The problem with BHT is that it has been linked to cancer. Not what you want in your or your baby's products! Why Haven't These Ingredients Been Banned? The United States has currently only banned 30 substances from personal care products. Compare that with over 1,500 banned substances in Europe and you can see how far behind the United States's skincare regulations are. Fun fact: Mustela is a French-owned company, meaning we abide by the strict European regulations, rather than those of the U.S. Unlike the food industry, the skincare and beauty industry in the U.S. has been mostly untouched by the recent health movement. Food labels have become more transparent, but most skincare products for babies and adults haven't. What's worse is that consumers assume that everything is labeled like food, but this is not the case. The guidelines for what manufacturers can include in their products haven't been revised for almost 80 years. That leaves a lot of leeway. But now, consumers are more conscious about what they put on their skin and on their babies' skin. That new-found awareness has led to a demand for organic, natural, and clean skin care.
