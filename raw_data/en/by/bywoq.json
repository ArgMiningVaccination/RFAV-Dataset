View the ATAGI statement here. [View the ATAGI statement here](https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-update-on-the-covid-19-vaccination-program?language=en#:~:text=ATAGI%20recommends%20that%20all%20adults,passed%20since%20their%20last%20dose.). Who can get vaccinated? All people aged 5 years and over are recommended to be up to date with vaccinations against COVID-19. Eligible children aged 6 months to under 5 years with medical conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 can be vaccinated. This includes children with the following or similar conditions: - Severe primary or secondary immunodeficiency, including those undergoing treatment for cancer, or on immunosuppressive treatments - Bone marrow or stem cell transplant or chimeric antigen T-cell (CAR-T) therapy - Complex congenital cardiac disease - Structural airway anomalies or chronic lung disease - Type 1 diabetes mellitus - Chronic neurological or neuromuscular conditions - A disability that requires frequent assistance with activities of daily living, such as severe cerebral palsy or Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). Why get vaccinated? Getting vaccinated has many benefits, including: - You are less likely to get sick and become very unwell or die from COVID-19 - To protect your family and the community, especially people who are at most risk from severe illness - The virus will have a harder time spreading in the community. Even if you have had COVID-19, you should still stay up to date with your vaccinations. Talk to your doctor or [call Healthdirect on 1800 022 222](tel:1800022222) if you have questions about the benefits of being vaccinated. Booster vaccines Why you should get a booster Boosters are highly recommended to help keep up your immunity against COVID-19. A booster dose will continue to protect you from severe illness from COVID-19. The current advice from ATAGI on additional 2023 booster vaccines are below: ATAGI recommends that all adults aged 75 years or older should receive an additional 2023 COVID-19 vaccine dose if 6 months have passed since their last dose. ATAGI advises the following groups should consider an additional 2023 COVID-19 vaccine dose if 6 months have passed since their last dose, after discussion with their healthcare provider: - All adults aged 65 to 74 years, and/or - Adults aged 18 to 64 years with [severe immunocompromise](https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-statement-on-the-use-of-a-3rd-primary-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-individuals-who-are-severely-immunocompromised?language=en). [Within the above groups, an additional 2023 COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be of most benefit for people who:] - Have no known history of COVID-19 infection (and therefore are unlikely to have protection from hybrid immunity), - Have medical comorbidities that increase their risk of severe COVID-19, or disability with significant or complex health needs, or - Reside in a residential aged care facility. ATAGI continues to encourage all adults who were [ recommended to have a COVID-19 vaccine dose in February 2023](https://www.health.gov.au/news/atagi-2023-booster-advice), and who have not yet had one, to receive a vaccine dose as soon as possible. For younger people or older adults without severe immunocompromise who have already had a dose in 2023, no further doses are currently recommended. Their risk of severe illness is low if they have already been vaccinated, and particularly if they have also had prior infection. Therefore a further 2023 dose will offer little additional benefit even if it has been more than 6 months since their last dose. People with severe immunocompromise For most people, a primary course is considered two doses. However, a third primary dose received as part of the primary course is recommended for some and is different from a booster dose. For people who are severely immunocompromised, a third vaccination is recommended as part of their primary course to promote a good immune response. The third dose should be given from two months after the second dose. A booster dose can then be given six months after completing the primary course. Vaccination after having COVID-19 The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) generally recommends waiting six months between testing positive for COVID-19 and getting the next scheduled dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The next scheduled dose should be given as soon as possible after this period. Waiting at least six months between infection and vaccination is likely to lead to a better immune response and result in longer protection from reinfection. While there is minimal benefit in having a COVID-19 vaccine dose too soon after infection, ATAGI notes that current COVID-19 testing rates have dropped significantly, so from a practical perspective it is challenging to know if or when individuals last had an infection. Where previous infection details are unknown, it is appropriate to proceed with a first 2023 dose, or an additional dose for eligible people. A person may be vaccinated earlier than the recommended 6-month interval where considered appropriate, such as before starting an immunosuppressant, before overseas travel or if someone cannot reschedule vaccination easily (such as in an outreach vaccination program). About COVID-19 vaccines Different COVID-19 vaccines are available for different age groups. Find out more about them on the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care [website.] age-appropriate bivalent mRNA vaccines are preferred for the primary course over existing (ancestral) vaccines from the age of 12 years old. These include the Pfizer and Moderna bivalent vaccines. There is currently no bivalent vaccine available for children aged 6 months to 11 years, and existing original vaccines should continue to be used for this age group. For boosters, age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster vaccines are preferred over the original vaccines.
