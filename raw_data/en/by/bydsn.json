Many of the seniors, like many of the rest of us, would tend to understate the risk of actually contracting tetanus upon falling behind on inoculation . How, if at all, should government respond to indiv iduals' frequent assumption that \"it won't happen to them\" when \"it\" is something bad ( such as contracting t etanus) ? Few would suggest a legal mandate of an up -to-date tetanus vaccine - tetanus not being a communicable disease - but the study of college seniors focused on an approach with similar effects: creating a default in favor of vaccination. In a strikingly successful manipulation, the study's authors asked half of the college seniors to review their schedules for the coming fortnight and locate a specific time at which they would pass by the health service and could stop in for an inoculation. This seemingly minor request increased the proportion of seniors in the study who obtained tetanus shots by more than sevenfold! While these sorts of \"d efault \" or status quo effects have received enormous recent attention in behavioral economics, this book passionately champions a competing prominent strand of behavioral economics analysis of law. Rather than changing the \"default\" people face with an ey e to channeling them into a desired form of behavior , law often does, and should, Introduction - 2 debias people's misperceptions - bringing them closer to a state of ken.1 What is so compelling about ken approaches is that, in these approaches, law acknowledges the human limits identified by behavioral economics but responds only through efforts to improve the accuracy of people's perceptions about facts. If the best available evidence suggests that \"Wil l\" has an X% chance of developing tetanus in the twelve months following falling behind on his vaccinations, but Will's own estimate is 0.1X% because he thinks \"it won't happen to him,\" a ken approach will seek to move his 0.1X% estimate closer to X% - but it will not otherwise seek to influence his decision about vaccination. Why is this important? There are several possible answers, one of which is at the heart of this book. Even for a relatively uncomplicated matter such as tetanus inoculation, people have complex objectives and constraints. In the study of college seniors, for instance, the students defaulted into inoculation may well have been busy with senior honors theses, completion of their graduation requirements, and researching and interviewi ng for post -graduation jobs. Tetanus inoculation, while typically a relatively minor procedure, can produce meaningful negative effects.2 Furthermore, college seniors are not even due for inoculation against tetanus 1 For purposes of this book, \"ken\" will refer to knowledge or capacity, as in \"[C]limbing ken may be crucial for the fish, which live in strong, high -flow streams\" ( National Geographic , Jan. 22, 2009). 2 As one recipient reported, \"I got a tetanus shot 22 days ago. The muscle in my arm where the shot was given is still so sore the arm is useless. I 've used it despite the pain in an effort to strengthen the muscle, but it causes the pain to become severe.\" http://www.wisegeek.com/why - does-the-tetanus -vaccine -hurt-so-much.htm . If that experience is extreme, \"[t]he truth is that the tetanus vaccine is ... a particularly painful shot to receive and the residual pain can last for days or even weeks. Some people report feelings of numbness ... radiating pain throughout thei r arms, neck, and back, ... general fatigue and muscle weakness.\" Id.; see also http://www.medicinenet.com/tetanus_toxoid -injection/article.htm (product information) ( \"Mild fever, joint pain, muscle aches, nausea, tiredness, or pain /itching/ swelling/redness at the injection site may occur. Acetaminophen may be used to reduce these effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell the doctor or pharmacist promptly. ... Tell the doctor immediately if any Introduction - 3 under the standard immunization schedu le in the United States . Government's defaulting them into getting a shot without ever directly engaging with the potential factual errors in their risk perceptions shares some of the same strands of \"paternalism\" that legally mandating a tetanus immuniza tion schedule would exhibit; in both cases, government chooses a particular vaccination schedule it believes is best and then induces that schedule in its citizens (either by mandating or by defaulting). In a free society, people should, as much as possib le, be left alone to choose the actions they think are best - not those the government thinks are best - when , as in the case of tetanus, primarily th eir own well -being is at stake. Ken approaches preserve this fundamental attribu te of freedom. Unlike de faults , these approaches do not seek to channel people's decisions; instead they simply seek to improve the factual accuracy of people's risk perceptions. Recall Will, who was optimistic about his risk of contracting tetanus in the next twelve months. If Will comes to understand that his true risk is X%, it could nonetheless be the right decision for Will not to get vaccinated when due for inoculation (say, because Will's father is widowed and undergoing grueling medical treatments as he battl es a terminal illness, and Will - who knows from past experience that he is in the group of individuals likely to experience extreme soreness and fever from the tetanus vaccine - is his father's sole source of companionship and emotional strength). As lon g as Will's estimate of his tetanus risk is consistent with the best available evidence, a government committed to freedom should not default him into a particular inoculation schedule (or legally mandate that he follow such a schedule). And the same is t rue of decisions about matters other than tetanus. of these rare but very serious side effects occur: tingling of the hands/feet, hearing problems, trouble swallowing, muscle weakness, seizures. \"). Introduction - 4 Because ken approaches do not involve government in channeling citizens toward particular outcomes that government views as what citizens \"would\" (or should) want in an ideal world, these approaches allow legal academics and policy makers to move beyond the increasingly rancorous debates in recent years over \"patern alism\" in behavioral economics.3 Ken approaches are simply focused on bringing people's estimates into closer alignment with the estimates su ggested by the best available evidence. While many difficult issues of implementation remain (and are discussed in this book), the re is also a crucial matter of principle at stake : In a free society, government should generally not seek to channel its ci tizens' decisions t oward government's preferred choices .4 American law often reflects an implicit recognition of this book's plea that government look first to ken approaches . In the past decade, a striking example comes from the 2006 Pension Protection A ct, in which Congress clarified that firms would not violate federal pension law if the firms defaulted employees into a particular level of retirement saving in a 401(k) plan. Note what the 2006 Act did not do: It did not have the government specify a d efault of a particular level of retirement saving in such plans - even though the evidence is overwhelming that specifying a default of contributing a positive fraction of earnings to a 401(k) plan significantly increases the likelihoo d that an individual will save,5 and even though a great many American firms today still do no t specify such a positive contribution default. Not only would a government -specified contribution default have increased saving significantly, but just such a government -specified d efault was adopted in the same year as the Pension Protection Act by New Zealand , and a year later the United Kingdom followed suit (Beshears, Choi, Laibson, 3 See Chapter 2 . 4 Of course, third -party effects provide a qualification. Se e Chapter 6 for further discussion. 5 <Sources.> Introduction - 5 Madrian, and Weller 2010) . Yet such a default was never even seriously considered in the American context.6 Instead , the American legislators chose an arrangement under which a private actor , not the government, selects among potential default contributions - a positive 401(k) contribution versus a zero 401(k) contribution. And t he 2006 Pension Prot ection Act's placing the choice of \"default\" in the hands of private actors has been followed by extensive research on optimal disclosure formats in the retirement saving context - exactly in the spirit of the ken approaches celebrated in the following cha pters.7 6 At least, my research on the 2006 Act and subsequent developments did not turn up any mention of consideration of such a default. 7 <Sources on disclosure formats in retirement saving context.> The pension example, involving private firms, reveals that the term \"paternalism\" is sometimes used to describe the behavior of a non-governmental actor such as an employer. See Beshears, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Weller (2010, p. at __) (describing how \"[t ]he staunchest opponents\" of employer adoption of automatic enrollment felt it was \"too paternalistic\"). In this book, however, \"paternalism\" is used as the term is typically used in behavioral law and economics - to refer to actions by government. Chapter 1 - 1 Chapter 1: What We Don't Know 1.1 \"It can't happen to me\" This book is addressed to contexts in which people tend to underestimate the risk of negative events befalling them. Such optimistic bias about negative events can occur in a variety of ways. People may have reasonably accurate information about the average risk of a negative event but assume that the ir own risk is below average (an assumption that can of course be true for some people - but not for all). Alternatively, people may have little information about the average risk of a given occurrence but nonetheless assume that their own risk is \"very low\" - much lower than it actually is - or they may develop an excessively low estimate of the average risk. <Remainder of this chapter omitted.> Chapter 2 - 1 Chapter 2: The V irtues of Ken 2.1 Ways to Ken A central aspect of behavioral law and economics is the attempt to refine and deepen the conventional economic argument for government provision of information when individuals would otherwise operate under misperceptions about factual matters. Economics powerfully defends the availability of truthful, relevant information as an alternative to curtailing individual choice; behavioral economics both qualifies and strengthens the force of this prescription by distinguishing methods of providing truthful, accurate information t hat typically do little to correct factual misperceptions from methods that are efficacious in achieving this objective . In seeking to decrease misperceptions among those who believe \"it can't happen to me,\" three general approaches in behavioral economi cs have enjoyed particular success. <Remainder of this section omitted.> 2.2 Default -Setting, Ken, and Paternalism Recall the college seniors who considered the risk of tetanus and, in some cases, were asked to locate a specific time in the coming weeks when they would pass by the health service and could stop in for an inoculation. Creating a form of default or statu s quo under which they Chapter 2 - 2 would get an inoculation profoundly altered behavior; that much is clear. But was there a change for the better? Tetanus not being communicable, it is natural to approach this question by looking to the individual seniors' well -being, but that approach immediately places us in an immensely difficult spot. For, as William Congdon, Jeffrey Kling, and Sendhil Mullainathan (2011) emphasize in their recent comprehensive book on behavioral economics and public policy, the fundamental upshot of the behavioral economics literature on default or status quo effects is that \"choices no longer reveal preference ... because people may reveal multiple preferences\" (p. 8). As \"[w]elfare analysis is built on the assumption that choice reveals prefer ence, with social welfare reflecting an aggregation of the utility functions thus revealed,\" the instability of preference \"deprives ... economics of a clean analytical foundation for assessing the welfare impact of policies\" (pp. 8 -9). The instability of preference was all the opening a group of fierce \"antipaternalists\" needed to launch a broad -scale attack in recent years on the use of behavioral economics in policy making. As economist Glen Whitman (2010) expressed the \"paternalism\" concern, using more measured language than, unfortunately, has been sometimes been employed in these debates: [I]n recent years, a novel form of paternalism has emerged on the policy stage. ... '[N]ew paternalism' seeks to make people better off by their own standards . New paternalism has gone by many names, including ... 'libertarian paternalism,' [and] arose from the burgeoning field of behavioral economics .... [W]hen confronted with an inconsistency of choice, the new paternalists have often - with no grounding in theory or evidence - chosen among competing preferences. ... Thus, when choosing between more and less patient rates of time discounting, they have always favored greater patience. When choosing between 'hot' and 'cold' preferences related to purchases, they have a lways favored the 'cold' ones. What gives them license to do this? ... One the one hand, the new Chapter 2 - 3 paternalists want to say they're making people better off according to their own true preferences. On the other, they say inconsistencies of choice reveal th at people don't actually have true preferences. They can't have it both ways! In many of their policy proposals, the new paternalists are in fact picking and choosing whichever preferences they think best. Law professor and economist Jonathan Klick has s imilarly, if more colorfully, objected to policy proposals that \"impose some kind of external judgment\" to sort \"good\" preferences from \"bad\".1 Now, this is \"not my usual crowd\" - to borrow a wonderful line from Dean Martha Minow (1995) . However, while P rofessors Whitman and Klick and their fellow travelers do not approach many things in the same way that the Congdon, Kling and Mullainathan volume does - or in the same way that this book does - these \"antipaternalists\" have a point in objecting to attempt s to channel individuals toward government -preferred choices. Channeling proponents have responded that \"paternalism\" is inevitable, so that at tacking defaults for being \"paternalistic\" is an incoherent, or at lea st a misguided, critique : \"[G]overnments ... have to provide starting points of one or another kind; this is not avoidable. ... [Governments] do so every day through the rules of contract and tort, in a way that inevitably 1 I wish I had as much money as [behavioral economist Richard] Thaler. Presumably, among the reasons I don't are because I neither save enough nor work hard enough. I take my boys to Phillies games, costing money and time, among other diversions that thwart my stated goal of being rich. Would I be better off if someone nudged me to save more mone y and to spend more time working? Thaler and the other libertarian paternalists repeatedly emphasize that they want to make people better off as judged by themselves. If I say I want to be rich, but then fail to do things that are likely to lead to that outcome, does that mean that I need to be nudged or does it mean that my stated goal was a highly condition al statement (shorthand for \"I want to be rich as long as it means I don't have to work very hard or give up any consumption in the short term, otherwise I would rather continue doing what I'm doing perhaps while wearing a monocle and a top hat\")? Whether a nudge makes someone better off as judged by himself depends crucially on whether we think actions or words better reflect the person's subjective judgment. Chapter 2 - 4 affects some preferences and choices. In this respect, the antipaternalist p osition is unhelpful - a literal nonstarter. \" (Sunstein and Thaler 2003, p. 1165.) If this were right, it wou ld certainly be a compelling rip oste to the \"antipaternalists. \" Is it? If \"paternalism\" referred to any influence, of any sort, of government on people's attitudes and behavior, then certainly \"paternalism\" would be inevitable ; indeed, this theme was a major emphasis of the Critical Legal Studies movement in legal thought in the 1980s.2 However, the fact that government cannot pristinely and auste rely avoid ever influencing people's choice behavior in any way (other than through the correction of factual errors) obviously does not establish all forms of influence as undif ferentiatedly \"paternalistic\".3 Consider some extreme cases of concern with government influence. It has been widely documented that people's response to written material may vary greatly with a simple change in the font in which the material is presented (e.g., Doyle and Bottomly 2004) . Because it is implausible to suggest, in response, that any government communication with its citizens, even in the form of (for example) a statement about the level of one's Social Security benefits or Medicare prescriptions, is objectionably \"paternalistic\" by virtue of its effects on people's attitudes and behaviors, \"paternalism\" cannot sensibly refer to any such effect of government 2 See, for example, Kelman (1989, p. __): [W]hat seems to be demonstrated . . . is the impossibil ity of defining desires for end states without recognizing that the end states can scarcely be understood without reference to the collective and legal background. There is no single -valued 'desire' as desire; each is simply the contextually influenced understanding of both a want and an end state that cannot be abstracted from the legal setting in which one understands precisely what it is that one is seeking. Legal scholars of va rying persuasions have widely accepted the ubiquity of government influence on preferences. See, e.g., Kaplow and Shavell (2002, pp. 413 -18). 3 Indeed, d efault -setting advocates themselves implicitly acknowledge this truth in assiduously distinguishing de faults from mandates. Chapter 2 - 5 behavior. To take another case, a recent study found that subjects faced with a decision whether to purchase a $14.99 DVD were significantly more likely to purch ase when the decision not to purchase was worded \"not buy\" than when the decision not to purchase was worded \"keep t he $14.99 for other purchases\" ( Frederick, Novemsky, Wang, Dhar, and Nowlis 2009) . Even such a familiar and simple decision was significant ly shaped by the details of the verbal formulation. When literally any detail about a government communication may significantly influence people's behavior, it is unhelpful to use the term \"paternalism\" to refer to any effect of government on such behavi or. Sensibly defined, then, \"paternalism\" is not inevitable, and we are back to the hard question of what sorts of endeavors fall within the proper province of government in a free society. Just as some forms of government influence on people's attitude s and behaviors are inevitable, some government default -setting is inevitable. At the most foundational level, a default establishing a set of communicative signals (a language) for individuals to use - if nothing else to specify a change to a different s et of signals they wish to utilize instead - is unavoidable, and thus any system of law involves government in establishing at least some defaults (see, e.g., Thaler and Sunstein 2008) . But defaults such as the one adopted in the college tetanus study are not foreordained. In the tetanus study, both the default of no pre - scheduling of an inoculation time and the default of pre -scheduling of an inoculation time could be avoided by having the college seniors choose whether they wanted to pre -schedule an inoculation time.4 To be sure, that choice regime itself is a sort of default, as the seniors could instead be asked to select whether they would be given the choice about pre -scheduling an inoculation time, and so on and so on in an infinite recursion. As with paternalism, some version 4 See Carroll, Choi, Laibson, Madrian and Metrick (2009) for an extensive analysis of an analogous approach to retirement saving in 401(k) accounts. Chapter 2 - 6 of default -setting is inevitable, but this thin observation does not tell us much of interest. In the tetanus study, there is not a need to specify either a default of no pre -scheduling or a default of pre-scheduling, and it seems natural to think that a free society would generally prefer a default of student choice over whether to pre -schedule to either of those other defaults (though it is not the task of this book to offer a rigorous defense of this view).5 <Remainder of this section and the following section omitted.> 5 Among other things, the answer will vary with context; the material circumstances s urrounding some contexts may restrict the set of plausible default rules. Consider the much -discussed example of a cafeteria (Thaler and Sunstein 2008) ; if government were setting up multiple cafeterias in close proximity to each other, it might be natura l to think that a free society would generally prefer that individuals have the choice between a government cafeteria placing salad and fruit first and a government cafeteria placing desserts first - but if government is setting up a single cafeteria in a given vicinity, a single default is inevitable for the cafeteria - either salad and fruit first or desserts first. In these sorts of circumstances, government choices that seek to shape people's decisions through the choice of the default may be inevitabl e. In many circumstances, however, such as in the tetanus study or with respect to retirement saving in 401(k) accounts under the 2006 Pension Protection Act , it seems possible - and conventional - for government to choose a default without in any way see king to shape people's behavior. Chapter 5 - 1 Chapter 5 : Application III - Tobacco Regulation1 Smoking is a domain in which empirical study of individuals' factual perceptions about risks - and of the effects of tobacco regulation on such perceptions - has been particularly extensive. In part, the large body of available data is a result of an important and controversial article by W. Kip Viscusi (1990). Viscusi's study provides the jumping -off point for the analysis in this chapter. 5.1 Optimism Bias and Smoking The core finding in Viscusi's 1990 study was that smokers asked to estimate a typical smoker's risk of developing smoking -related lung cancer tended to overstate this risk. The study , however, focused exclusively on smoking -related lung cancer. As Viscusi himself was careful to note, lung cancer is responsible for only about a third of all smoking -related deaths (Viscusi 1990). Thus, a ssessing the accuracy of individuals' perception s of smoking risks requires data on other major forms of smoking -related illness as well. The empirical evidence discussed in this section supports the conclusion that, indeed, the average consumer significantly underestimates the risk of smoking -related health conditions. 1 Tables 5.1 and 5.3 and the analysis of these tables are from Jolls (2013). Chapter 5 - 2 About a decade ago, the Annenberg Tobacco Risk Study asked respondents in the United States to indicate about what number of smokers out of 100 could be expected to \"die from a smoking -related illness.\"2 Epidemiological evidence places this figure at about 50 out of 100 smokers. Thus, the survey responses to this risk -of-mortality question may be analyzed by categorizing them as \"underestimates\" ( estimates of fewer than 34 smoking -related deaths out of 100 smokers); responses in the \"accurate range\"; and \"overestimates\" ( estimates of 68 or more deaths out of 100 smokers). As shown in Romer and Jamieson's (2001) Table 3, which is reproduced in the Appendix, respondents who smoke (defined as those who hav e smoked one or more cigarettes in the preceding 30 days) tend to underestimate the number of smoking -related deaths out of 100 smokers ; the ratio of risk underestimation to risk overestimation among smokers in Table A1 (94:82) is more than half again as l arge as the ratio of risk underestimation to risk overestimation among nonsmokers (69:93). To probe the robustness of this suggestive evidence of risk un derestimation by smokers, Table 5.1 below presents results from multinomial logit regressions of respon dents' underestimation, accurate estimation, or overestimation of smoking risks on respondents' smoking status and the demographic covariates of sex, race, ethnicity, age, and geographic region , covariates that are not reflected in Romer and Jamieson's summary statistics table. Columns ( A), (C), (E), and (G) of Table 5 .1 present estimated marginal effects for the outcome of risk underestimation, while columns (B), (D), (F), and (H) of the table present estimated marginal effects for the outcome of response in the accurate range. (Estimated coefficients 2 http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/HMCA/studies/3049 provides access to the full set of available data from the Annenberg Tobacco Risk Study. Aspects of the data other than those analyzed here are discussed in Romer and Jamieson (2001) and Slovic (2001). Chapter 5 - 3 appear in Appendix Table 1.) Estimates are all relative to effects for the omitted outcome of risk overestimation. The results in Table 5 .1 support the conclusion that smokers often have factual mispercepti ons about the risk of death from a smoking -related illness. The estimated marginal effect of being a smoker on risk underestimation is positive and differs from zero by a statistically significant margin in each of columns (A), (C), (E), and (G); as the r esults with and without controls for the demographic covariates noted above show, controlling for these covariates has little effect on the results. Columns ( B), (D), (F), and (H) of Table 5 .1 reinforce the conclusion, as they show that smoking is modestl y negatively correlated with responses in the accurate range. Overall, these results suggest that smokers tend to underestimate the risks of smoking.

The dummy variable for smoking is equal to 1 if the respondent smoked cigarettes in the preceding 30 days and 0 otherwise . Effects of race are relative to individuals who identified as \"other\" rather than white, black, or Asian. Effects of Hispanic ethnicity are relative to individuals identified as non -Hispanic. Effects of age are relative to indiv iduals age 14 -16. Effe cts of geographic region are relative to individuals from the northeast.

Chapter 5 - 5 5.2 Ken Through Mandated Tobacco Warnings How might smokers attain a more accurate understanding of the factual risks of smoking? Governments in the United States and around the world have adopted requirements that tobacco advertisements and packaging carry mandated health warnings. The mandated health warnings adopted in 2009 in the United States - warnings that are in the process of being revised in response to adverse judicial decisions - involve two major components. First, the warnings contain a specified text statement (for example, \"WARNI NG: Smoking can kill you\"), and second, they incorporate an acco mpanying graphic image. Table 5 .2 below presents a series of the most recent text-image warnings developed for use in the United States . Tables 5.3 through 5 .5 present empirical results on the effects of these warnings in a large -scale experimental study in the United States (Experimental Study of Graphic Cigarette Warning Labels ). The national opt -in e-mail list sample used in the study consists of smokers who viewed either a text -image warn ing of the sort shown in Table 5 .2 or a paired warning that contained the same text statement as the text -image warning but no accompanying graphic image.3 3 http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA -2010 -N-0568 -0008 provides access to the full set of available study data. The specific data used in the empirical analysis in this section appears in Appendix C -2 (pp. 1-29, 141 -169, and 212 -239). Chapter 5 - 6 Table 5 .2: United States Text-Image Tobacco Warnings 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Chapter 5 - 7 Table 5.2: United States Text -Image Tobacco Warnings (continued from previous page) 8 9 Source : http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA -2010 -N-0568 -0002 (under \"Proposed Required Warning Images\"). Chapter 5 - 8 Tables 5.3, 5.4, and 5 .5 present estimates of the effects of text -image versus text -only warnings on respondents' answers to the eight questions from the experimental study that involved subjects' factual perceptions of smoking risks (as distinguished from questions about smoking's emotional valence for respondents and other matters distinct from their factual perceptions of smoking risks ).4 The estimated effects are in the form of logistic regression odds ratios with values less than one if respondents exposed to an text-image warning were less likely to have answered a given question affirmatively than respondents exposed to a text -only warning and values greater than one if they were more likely to have answered affirmatively. Tables 5.3, 5.4, and 5 .5 reflect results for all warning pairs that, for at least one of the eight risk perception questions in the experimental study, had an od ds ratio that differed from one by more than a factor of two - a reasonably demanding test of magnitude - and that differed from one by a statistically significant margin. Accordingly, warning pairs with odds ratios either less than one - half or more than two - and different from one by a statistically significant margin at the five - percent level - for one or more of the eight risk perception questions noted above are reflected in Tables 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5. Table 5 .3 presents results from respondents over the a ge of 24, while Table 5 .4 presents results from respondents in thei r early twenties, and Table 5 .5 presents results for \"youth\" (teen) respondents. The twelve wa rning pairs contained in Table 5 .3 represent one -third of the total 4 The full text of the survey is provided in Appendix A of Experimental Study of Graphic Cigarette Warning Labels . Order effects of the survey questions are not a concern for the analysis here because the analysis examines results for respondents who viewed a text -image warning relative to results for those who viewed a paired text -only warning, and there is no reason to think that the ordering of questions would produce differential effects across these two groups. Chapter 5 - 9 group of 36 warning pairs examined in the data analyzed for respondents over the age of 24;5 by contrast, far smaller numbers of warning pairs met the criteria for inclusion in the younger samples reflected in Tables 5.4 and 5.5. Columns (A) and (B) of Tables 5.3, 5. 4, and 5 .5 present estimates of the effects of text - image versus text -only warnings on respondents' level of agreement with two assertions that individuals with factually accurate risk perceptions would consider to be false. The first assertion is that so meone who has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for more than twenty years will achieve \"little health benefit\" from quitting (corresponding results appear in column (A) in Tables 5.3, 5.4, and 5 .5); and the second assertion is that because \"many people wh o smoke live to a ripe old age,\" smoking is \"not all that bad\" for one's health (corresponding results appear in column (B) in Tables 5.3, 5.4, and 5 .5).6 Respondents who chose either \"strongly agree\" or \"agree,\" \"neither agree nor disagree,\" \"disagree,\" or \"strongly disagree,\" in response to these assertions can reasonably be viewed as exhibiting factual misperceptions at least to some degree;7 accordingly, an association between a given text -image warning and a lower level of agreement with t he assertions provides some evidence that factual misperceptions are lower with the text -image warning. As shown by the results i n columns (A) and (B) of Table 5 .3, the text -image warnings in rows II (image of woman in rain), IV (image of woman in oxygen m ask), V (imag e of smoke approaching baby), VI (image of cancerous lesion on lip), and X (image of gravestone) produced 5 The study grouped each of the nine text statements with between two and six graphic images, a procedure that produced 36 text-image warnings in all for study within each of the three samples of respondents. 6 Question text is from Experimental Study of Gra phic Cigarette Warning Labels (Appendix A, pp. A -11 to A -12). 7 Question coding information is from Experimental Study of Graphic Cigarette Warning Labels (Appendix B, pp. 4 -18 to 4 -19). Chapter 5 - 10 substantially lower levels of agreement with the assertions than text -only counterparts. In these five rows, at least one of the two est imated odds ratios in columns (A) and (B) satisfies both the magnitude test noted above - here, that the estimated odds ratio is below one -half, indicating a substantially lower level of agreement with the assertions among respondents who viewed a text - image warning - and a test of statistical significance. In row IV, estimated odds ratios are below one-half both in column (A) and in column (B). While text -image warnings were associated with lower levels of agreement with one or both of the assertions in the five rows just noted, in rows IX, XI, and XII these warnings were associated with higher levels of agreement with one of the assertions; with respect to row IX, however, estimated odds ratios for a number of the questions other than question (A) suppor t the conclusion that factual misperceptions are lower with a text -image warning (columns (D), (E), (F), and (H) of row IX, with estimated odds ratios of 1.749, 2.105, 1.985, and 2.138, estimates that will be discussed more fully below). Overall, the esti mates discussed thus far provide support for the conclusion that factual misperceptions tend to be (though they are not inevitably) lower with a text -image warning than with a text -only alternative. <Discussion of results in columns (A) and (B) of Tables 5 .4 and 5.5 to be added.> Columns (C) and (D) of Tables 5.3, 5.4, and 5 .5 present estimates of the effects of text- image versus text -only warnings on respondents' answers to the question \"Do you think your smoking has affected your health?\" and a follow -on question asking \" how concerned\" respondents were that smoking had affected their health.8 Respondents with accurate perceptions of smoking risks probably could not answer \"no\" when asked whether smoking had 8 Question text is from Experimental Study of Graphic Cigarette War ning Labels (Appendix A, pp. A -11 to A -12); coding information is also provided (Appendix B, pp. 4 -18 to 4 -19). Chapter 5 - 11 affected their health; thus, an increase in the frequency of \"yes\" answers to the \"health effects of smoking\" with a text -image warning - as indicated by an estimated odds ratio greater th an one in column (C) of Table 5 .3 - provides support for a decline in factual misperceptions. Analysis of response s to the inquiry about \"how concerned\" respondents were that smoking had affected their health is complicated by the fact that two different interpretations of the question are possible. Respondents might have thought that they were being asked about the level of likelihood they attached to experiencing smoking -related health effects (just as someone \"very concerned\" about the weather might think the chance of rain was very high). Alternatively, respondents might have believed that they were being asked a bout the degree of negative emotion or feeling (\"concern\") they had about smoking -related health effects. On the first interpretation of the question - which matches the conception of risk utilized in this chapter (compare Slovic 2001) - respondents are b eing asked about the likelihood of a negative effect, and thus answers to the question should be probative, at least to some degree, of perceptions of smoking risks; on the second interpretation, however, respondents' answers might be unrelated to the perc eived likelihood of harm. On the first interpretation, a greater level of expressed concern about health effects among respondents will tend to support the conclusion that factual misperceptions have declined because, as discussed below, a diverse set of analyses and data suggest that underestimation of the overall risks of smoking is common. Of course, there is no guarantee that any increase in perceived risk, no matter how large, would reduce individuals' factual misperceptions; it is conceivable that f actual misperceptions could be larger if respondents' perceived level of risk swung from too low to an even larger error in the opposite direction. Chapter 5 - 12 As shown by the results in column (C) of Table 5.3, a text -image warning produced a substantial enough incre ase, relative to the paired text -only warning, in the frequency of \"yes\" answers to the question about whether respondents believed smoking had affected their health to yield estimated odds ratios greater than two, and different from one by a statistically significant margin, both in row III and in row VII. Thus, the results in these rows suggest a lower level of factual misperceptions under the text-image warning. I n addition, in row IX of Table 5 .3, the estimated odds ratio of 1.749 in column (C) exceed s one by a statistically significant margin at the ten -percent level - providing some slight additional support for the conclusion that factual misperceptions are lower under a text-image warning than under a text -only alternative. Only in row I of Table 5.3 does the evidence provide support for increased rather than reduced factual misperceptions under a text-image warning (estimated odds ratio of 0.387 in column (C) ). Finally, in rows VIII and X of Table 5 .3, a text-image warning was, relative to its te xt-only counterpart, associated with greater \"concern\" about smoking -related health effects (column (D)), <Discussion of results in columns (C) and (D ) of Tables 5.4 and 5.5 to be added.> Chapter 5 - 13 Table 5 .3: Logistic Regression Odds Ratios - Text-Image vs. Text -Only Warnings , \"Adult \" Sample Warning statement # of obs.

Chapter 5 - 16 The remaining four risk perception questions in the experimental study are health - condition -specific questions. These questions ask how likely respondents believe a smoker is to experience cancer, \"fatal lung disease,\" heart disease, and stroke.9 A higher frequency of \"extremely and \"not at all likely\" answers, to these questions with text -image warning may or may not suggest reduced factual misperceptions with such a warning; it depends on what range of probability respondents attach to \"very likely,\" \"moderately likely,\" and the other answer categories to the health -condition -specific questions, as well as the actual probability of t he various individual health conditions given the best available evidence.10 What is most important in the analysis here, however, is not whether individuals' estimates of the risk of a particular smoking -related health condition, such as cancer, have become more accurate but whether their overall estimates of smoking risks have become more accurate; even in a case, for instance, in which text -image type warning produced an overestimate of the risk of smoking -related cancer in particular - such that factua l misperceptions with respect to that health condition had actually increased - it is possible, perhaps likely, that overall estimates of smoking risks would, by virtue of the text -image warning, be both higher and closer to factually accurate. (Many smok ing-related health conditions appear to be entirely off respondents' radar screens.) Nonetheless, the value of responses to the health -condition -specific questions in Table 2 is significantly limited by the considerations noted here. 9 Question text is from Experimental Study of Graphic Cigarette Warning Labels (Appendix A, pp. A -11 to A -12). 10 Question coding informatio n was obtained through correspondence with the experimental study's lead author. Chapter 5 - 17 In each of row s VI, V III, IX, and X of Table 5 .3, half or more of the health -condition questions elicited significantly higher expressed likelihoods - odds ratios above two and different from one by a statistically significant margin - from respondents who viewed a text- image warning than from those who viewed a text -only warning. Moreover, in row III, three of the four health condition questions produced estimated odds ratios that, although not over two, are close to two (1.782, 1.802, and 1.813) and different from one by a s tatistically significant margin. Only row VII of Table 5.3 exhibits the opposite pattern of lower expressed likelihoods with a text -image -type warning than with its text -only counterpart (columns (F) and (H)). In row IX, which the discussion above noted had one estimated odds ratio (column (A)) that supported an increase in factual misperceptions with a text -image warning in comparison to a text -only warning, the results for the four health condition questions point in the opposite direction (estimated od ds ratios of 2.105, 1.985, 1.397, and 2.138). <Discussion of results in columns (E) through (H) of Tables 5.4 and 5.5 to be added.> The results reported in this section generally support the conclusion that text -image warnings tend to reduce individuals ' factual misperceptions relative to these warnings' text -only counterparts. To be sure, it is important not to infer that in every case a text -image warning would reduce such misperceptions; the available data is not so definitive. However, the fact tha t among the 36 warning pairs in the data analyzed in Table 5 .3, for instance, nine text -image warnings produced lower factual misperceptions employing the fairly restrictive criteri a used in constructing Table 5.3 - while in only three cases was there evid ence (often quite limited) of higher factual misperceptions - supports the conclusion that text-image warnings on balance tend to reduce factual misperceptions. Importantly, in the three cases in which there was evidence of higher factual misperceptions u nder text -only warning in Table 5.3 (row s I, XI, and XII ), only a Chapter 5 - 18 single estimated odds ratio in each case supported the conclusion of increased factual misperceptions. This pattern provides some suggestion of the absence of a systematic increase in factu al misperceptions associated with any text -image warning. By contrast, seven of the nine warning pairs that produced evidence of lower factual misperceptions under an text -image warning had two or more estimated odds ratios that differed from one by a sta tistically significant margin in the direction of reduced factual misperceptions with a text -image warning (rows III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X), and six of these seven warning pairs had three or more estimated odds ratios that differed from one by a st atistically significant margin in that direction. Chapter 6 - 1 Chapter 6: Beyond Paternalism Recently, o ver a thousand employees at a large American company were subjected to the same \"default of inoculation\" as the college seniors described at the start of this book - though this time the inoculation was against influenza rather than tetanus (Milkman, Beshears, Choi, Laibson and Madrian 2011). These employees received mailers that provided them with information about the availability of free on -site vaccination - information that was provided to all company employees for whom influenza vaccination was indicated by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines - and also prompted them to write down a part icular date and time on which they planned to get vaccinated. (Specifically, the mailer included the following additional line of text: \"Many people find it helpful to make a plan for getting their shot. You can write yours here.\" The additional text w as followed by blanks for the date and time.) The predictable effect of this manipulation was to increase the likelihood of vaccination relative to employees who received the same information about the availability of free on -site vaccination but were not prompted to make a plan for getting vaccinated (though, interestingly, by less of a margin than in the tetanus study). The influenza study, however, differs profoundly from the tetanus study in that the effort to increase inoculation rates could well be motivated not a belief that inoculation would make individuals who obtained it better off but, instead, by a belief that increased inoculation rates Chapter 6 - 2 would yield significant social benefits. Because influenza is contagious, every inoculation of a given ind ividual produces a benefit to anyone who comes into contact with that individual. It is possible to quibble over whether social benefits fundamentally drive influenza inoculation policy, which most heavily targets individuals 50 years or age or older and those with chronic health conditions, suggesting at least some focus on protecting vulnerable individuals rather than society as a whole. (Of course, if the heavily targeted individuals are not only more likely to suffer severe consequences from influenza but also more likely to catch influenza, then influenza inoculation policy fits nicely with a focus on social benefits.) The crucial point, however, is more general. Policies that default individuals into particular outcomes may well be justified on the basis of significant third -party effects of such individuals' behavior . Policies addressed to third -party interests are, of course, familiar and ubiquitous in today's world; recent behavioral economics work on the power of default effects generates the n ovel and important suggestion that third -party effects may be effectively addressed through defaults rather than mandatory rules. But nothing in this argument provides any normative basis for using defaults to channel individuals' behavior \"for their own good.\" William Congdon, Jeffrey Kling, and Sendhil Mullainathan (2011, pp. 8 -9) express this fundamental point [In practice, government] policies aim to [address] ... [in which] there are first -order consequences of individuals' behavior to society , independent of the consequences for their own welfare. For example, if dec isionmaking biases lead individuals to systematically disfavor fuel -efficient vehicles, one can debate what their true utility function is. But the carbon externality tha t they impose in making their choice is clear. Congdon, Kling and Mullainathan's book therefore \"focus[es] on how behavioral economics changes policies in areas in which government already plays a traditional role\" (p. 9; cf. Chapter 6 - 3 Korobkin 2009). The approac h taken above is complementary in addressing how both existing law and potential reform may seek to eliminate or reduce individuals' misperceptions about risks in important decision making domains. Together, it is hoped that these approaches can move beha vioral economics analysis of policy and law beyond the paternalism debates of recent years and into a bright future ahead.
