If you suffer from chronic health conditions such as migraines, arthritis, or gastrointestinal issues alternative medicine can greatly improve your life. While chiropractic care, massages, and acupuncture are more well-known alternative treatments, there is another that has helped millions across the globe: moxibustion. Our staff at Back in Balance Wellness Center wants you to know how moxibustion can help you. What is Moxibustion? Moxibustion, a traditional Chinese medicine treatment that is usually employed in conjunction with acupuncture, can improve a variety of health conditions such as arthritis, digestive problems, fatigue, cold and flu prevention, cancer, and infertility. There are two types of moxibustion: indirect and direct. The direct method involves placing a moxa cone on your skin and letting it burn until you feel the heat, while the indirect method keeps the burning moxa one to inches above the skin. Here at the [Back in Balance Wellness Center](https://www.backinbalancechiro.com/) in Bangor, our acupuncturists use the indirect method as it is both safer and more pleasant for our patients. This ancient practice has been shown to have a number of specific health benefits. One of its most well-known uses is to turn breech babies in the womb before birth. Other common uses include managing pain, decreasing menstrual pain, boosting energy and stamina, improving headaches, and even decreasing the healing time of injuries. What Should You Expect During Treatment? During the session, your acupuncturist will compress dried mugwort into a small stick, allow it to smolder, and then hold it close to your skin at key acupuncture points. This stimulates the flow of Qi in the body, which then boosts the immune system and overall health and wellness. You may feel a rush of warmth along a pathway away from the application site. This is a great sign that the Qi is now flowing freely throughout your body! When Was It Developed? Moxibustion has a long history rooted in ancient China and traditional Chinese medicine. Some scholars believe that moxibustion was used as far back as the 16th century BCE, around 3,600 years ago! However, these early forms of treatment all involved applying the burning moxa directly to the skin; and it wasn't until around 200 AD that the indirect method was invented. The practice gained popularity in Japan during the 7th century and made its way to Europe in the 1600s. And now, centuries later, we use an evolved version right here in Bangor, over 7,000 miles away from where it first originated. Looking for Relief?
