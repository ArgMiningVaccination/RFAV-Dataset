Most all of us desire spiritual alignment. We may not call it that exactly, but the essence of it, is that we want to feel soulfully connected with ourselves, have purpose, be contributing to life in meaningful ways and feel as good as possible while engaged in this thing called being human. Many people have the misconception that being spiritually aligned means that everything is easy, you get what you want, and you never struggle, have painful sensations or feel bad. In fact people think that if their life is not the idealized picture they have in their head of what their life should be, then they must not be spiritually aligned. I'd like to make two distinctions. The first is that on an absolute level there is no such thing as misalignment or being out of alignment. Every single aspect of your experience is perfectly orchestrated for every learning and expression that you are participating in and creating. Rest knowing that all is well regardless of whatever your thoughts and feelings are about your current experience. The second distinction is that on a relative level, which is the level of this dualistic human playground, there is the experience of misalignment or being out of alignment. Part of the learning here in this human game is how to refine ourselves to become a closer and closer reflection and expression of our complete self. Since nearly all of us are living as a twisted or distorted fragment or version of ourselves, this refinement is a necessary process in coming home or remembering who we are. Back to spiritual alignment. What blocks or seems to interfere with our experience of it? The biggest obstacle is our definition of what it is and what it's not. The second is our lack of passion or intensity of desire for it. Lastly is our avoidance of un-pleasurable sensations, feelings or experiences. The combination of these three things makes for the experience of living spiritually unaligned. It takes redefining, intensifying and moving with un-pleasurable experiences in order for us to have a new experience of alignment. One that feels soulful, on purpose, and gives to others and life. As you move up the developmental levels of your being you start at your root where the focus is survival, then moving up to having personal, emotional and social needs met or achieved. The next level after that is the heart. Once you reach the level of the heart, living spiritually becomes the central focus of your learning, sharing and expression. Aligning yourself with the bigger picture of why you exist is fundamental to your growth as the spiritual being you are. LIVING SPIRITUALLY ALIGNED Redefining, intensifying & moving with un-pleasurable experiences Let's start with our definitions. We all have ideas and pictures in our minds of what living spiritually means. Take a moment to ponder, investigate and explore what your particular ideas and pictures are. Maybe there is a certain way you imagine it feels to be spiritually aligned. Perhaps you see yourself having certain financial resources and being at a certain \"place\" in your life. You might see that you have some special gift, knowing or intuitive abilities that you've harnessed. Maybe you have specific relationships, partnerships, or connections with people. Perhaps there are projects or work that you are doing that is more \"spiritual\" in nature. Most often we have many of these ideas running in the back of our mind as to what it means to be spiritual. Yet none of these things, ideas or pictures equals living spiritually aligned. These are all simply preferences and appearances. To live spiritually aligned is all about where you come from in your moment to moment experience and has nothing to do with the experiences themselves. Where you come from is an intention or vibration of beingness. Orienting to that over and over and over again is spiritual alignment. Next is intensifying our passion and desire for orienting to our intention for existing. We are mostly distracted by the experiences of life and what we are getting from them even if we think we are altruistic and spiritual. We often don't have much inner driving force beyond basic survival needs and personal and social validation. Once our needs are met and we feel validated in our existence, meaning we've proved to ourselves and everyone else that we are worthy and valuable, we often lack drive and intentionality. We're lazy. We don't have much self-discipline. Truly who can blame us. The experience of a human life is not exactly a walk in park and if we aren't literally \"forced\" (i.e. perceive a strong need) to make something happen then we typically won't bother. To be moved or driven, not by need, threat, loss, lack or what we think we will get, but rather moved only by our intention for existing is to live devoted. Devoted and committed to the sole purpose of our existence. This too provides the direct experience of spiritual alignment. Lastly is our avoidance of uncomfortable sensations and feelings. Whether or not you are aware of it your life is likely focused on how to increase pleasurable sensations and feelings, and how to avoid the un-pleasurable ones. We tend to categorize unpleasant sensations and feelings as less spiritual than the pleasant ones. When we feel bad we like to blame the circumstances, conditions, people, our body, ourselves, and on and on. Through our blaming we hope to feel better so that something can be responsible for how we feel, rather than allowing ourselves to feel what is present. I will simply say that life is full of un-pleasurable sensations and feelings. If you just accept it rather than avoid it, you can include all of your experiences inside of your spiritual alignment rather than push some of them away. Unpleasant sensations and feelings are not bad. They are just part of the experience. Suffering occurs only when we are in opposition to what is occurring, meaning when we resist it. Painful sensations and feelings do not equal suffering when we unwind our story about what they mean. I invite you to play with these 3 ingredients of living spiritually aligned. Redefine your definitions, intensify your desire and accept all the sensations and feelings that come with your experience. Recognize that perhaps living spiritually aligned is different than what you thought it was. Explore where you need to clean up or elevate your perspectives. Be surprised and surprise yourself. You might even find that you already are living your highest alignment. Dr. Amanda Love, Chiropractor, Network Spinal Analysis & Somato-Respiratory Integration, Boulder, Colorado "}
