Some believe it to be among the causes of the most urgent problemsfacing humankind today (e.g., Ehrlich and Ehrlich 1990), while others per- mute the elements of this causal chain, arguing, for example, that contem- porary poverty and illiteracy in poor countries are the causes, rather thanthe consequences, of rapid population growth. 1 Still others claim that even in the poorest countries population growth can be expected to provide a spur to economic progress.2 Among the many who remain, there is a wide spectrum of views, both on the determinants of population growth and on the effects of that growth on the natural-resource base and human welfare. It would seem not only that our attitudes toward population size and itsgrowth differ, but that there is no settled view on how the matter should be studied. As with religion and politics, many people have opinions on popu- lation that they cling to with tenacity. In this article I bring together theoretical and empirical findings to ar- gue that such divergence of opinion is unwarranted. In the first two sec- tions I offer the conjecture that differences persist because the interface ofpopulation, resources, and welfare at a spatially localized level has been a relatively neglected subject. Neglect by experts is probably also the reason why the nexus has attracted much popular discourse, which, while oftenilluminating, is frequently descriptive rather than analytical. It is not uncommon among those who write about population, re- sources, and welfare to adopt a global, future-oriented view: the emphasisfrequently is on the deleterious effects a large and increasingly affluent popu- lation would have on Earth in the future. 3 This slant has been instructive, but it has drawn attention away from the economic misery and ecologicaldegradation endemic in large parts of the world today. Disaster is not some- thing for which the poorest have to wait; it is a frequent occurrence. More- over, among the rural poor in developing countries, decisions on fertility,644 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentson allocations concerning education, food, work, health care, and on the use of the local natural-resource base are in large measure reached and implemented within households that are unencumbered by compulsory schooling and visits from social workers, that do not have access to creditand insurance in formal markets, that cannot invest in well-functioning capi- tal markets, and that do not enjoy the benefits of social security and old- age pension schemes. These features of rural life direct me, in the third sec-tion, to study the interface of population growth, poverty, and environmental stress from a myriad of household, and ultimately individual, viewpoints. Women's education and reproductive health have come to be seen as the most effective channels for influencing fertility. In subsequent sections I provide an outline of the theoretical and empirical reasons why they are so seen. An interesting analytical feature of both education and reproduc-tive health is that they can be studied within a framework where house- holds make decisions in isolation from other households. Thus, the theory of demand for education and reproductive health can be treated as a branchof the \"new household economics,\" which has been much engaged in the study of the isolated household. 4 But theoretical considerations suggest that a number of factors arising from interhousehold linkages could also influ-ence fertility decisions. In this article I am much interested in exploring such linkages. Appropriately, they include those in which women's educa- tion and reproductive health play a role. The findings I report are consis-tent with the contemporary emphasis on women's education and repro- ductive health. These matters are explored in the final two sections and the Appendix. I conclude that there is substance to what has been called thepopulation problem. I also argue that in the Indian subcontinent and in sub-Saharan Africa, the problem has for a long while been an expression of human suffering, and that the problem could well persist even if all regionsof the world were to make the transition to low fertility rates. Framing links between population, resources, and welfare It is appropriate first to identify some of the ways social scientists have framed the links between population growth, resources, and human welfare. I review them in this section. This outline will enable us to compare and contrast the way the links have generally been framed with the way I frame them here. There are three sets of examples to discuss here. They concern the way modern theories of economic growth view fertility and natural re- sources, the way population growth and economic stress in poor countriesare studied by environmental and resource economists, and the way devel- opment economists accommodate environmental stress in their analysis of contemporary poverty. The examples are discussed in the next three sections.If I grumble, there is cause. Judging by level of analysis, most of those whoPARTHA DASGUPTA 645 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentshave been investigating economic growth, poverty, environmental stress, and fertility behavior have not read widely beyond their particular fields of interest. One cannot but think that this has impeded progress in our understanding of some of the most complex issues in the social sciences. Population and resources in modern theories of growth For the most part, modern theories of economic growth assume populationchange to be a determining factor of human welfare. A central tenet of thedominant theory is that although population growth does not affect the long-run rate of change in living standards, it adversely affects the long-run standard of living (Solow 1956). Recent models of economic growth have been more assertive. They lay stress on new ideas as a source of progress, supposing that the growth of ideas is capable of circumventing any constraint the natural-resource basemay impose on the ability of economies to grow indefinitely. Such models note too that certain forms of investment (e.g., research and development) enjoy cumulative returns because the benefits are durable and can be sharedcollectively. The models also assume that growth in population leads to an increase in the demand for goods and services. An expansion in the de- mand for and supply of ideas implies that, in the long run, equilibrium out-put per head can be expected to grow at a rate that is itself an increasing function of the rate of growth of population. (It is only when population growth is nil that the long run rate of growth of output per head is nil.) Themodels regard indefinite growth in population to be beneficial. 5 Contemporary growth theory does not explicitly model the nature of new products. One can only conjecture that it assumes future innovationsto be of such a character that indefinite growth in output would make no more than a finite additional demand on the natural-resource base. The assumption is questionable (Daily 1997; Dasgupta 2001). In any event, weshould be skeptical of a theory that places such enormous burden on an economic regime not much more than 200 years old (Fogel 1994; Johnson 2000). Extrapolation into the past is a sobering exercise: over the long haulof history (some 5,000 years), economic growth even in the currently rich countries was for most of the time not much above zero. The study of pos- sible feedback loops between poverty, demographic behavior, and the char-acter and performance of both human institutions and the natural-resource base is not yet on the research agenda of modern growth theorists. Demography and economic stress in environmental and resource economics In its turn, the environmental and resource economics that has been devel- oped in the United States has not shown much interest in economic stress646 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsand population growth in poor countries. In their survey of the economics of environmental resources, Kneese and Sweeney (1985, 1993) and Crop- per and Oates (1992) bypassed the subject matter of this article. They were right to do so, for the prevailing literature regards the environmental-re-source base as an \"amenity.\" Indeed, it is today a commonplace that \"[eco- nomic] growth is good for the environment because countries need to put poverty behind them in order to care\" ( Independent, 4 December 1998), or that \"trade improves the environment, because it raises incomes, and the richer people are, the more willing they are to devote resources to cleaning up their living space\" ( The Economist, 4 December 1999: 17). I quote these views to suggest that natural resources are widely seen as luxuries. This view is hard to justify when one recalls that our natural environment maintains a genetic library, sustains the processes that pre-serve and regenerate soil, recycles nutrients, controls floods, filters pollut- ants, assimilates waste, pollinates crops, operates the hydrological cycle, and maintains the gaseous composition of the atmosphere. Producing as it doesa multitude of ecosystem services, the natural-resource base is in large part a necessity. 6 A wide gulf separates the perspective of environmental and resource economists in the North (I use the term in its current geopoliticalsense) from what would appear to be the direct experience of the poor in the South. 7 Population and resource stress in development economics Nor is the population-poverty-resource nexus a focus of attention among development economists. Even in studies on the semi-arid regions of sub- Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent (poverty-ridden land masses, inhabited by some 2 billion people and experiencing the largest additionsever known to their population; see Tables 1 and 2), the nexus is largely absent. For example, the authoritative surveys by Birdsall (1988), Kelley (1988), and Schultz (1988) on population growth in poor countries fail totouch on environmental matters. Mainstream demography also makes light of environmental stress facing poor communities in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Nor does the dominant literature on poverty (e.g.,Stern 1989; Dr\u00e8ze and Sen 1990; Bardhan 1996) take population growth and ecological constraints to be prime factors in development possibilities. 8 This situation is puzzling. Much of the rationale for development eco- nomics is the notion that poor countries suffer particularly from institu- tional failures. But institutional failures in great measure manifest them- selves as externalities. To ignore population growth and ecological constraintsin the study of poor countries would be to suppose that demographic deci- sions and resource use there give rise to no externalities of significance, and that externalities arising from institutional failure have a negligible effectPARTHA DASGUPTA 647 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 1 Crude birth and death rates per 1,000 people Births minus Births Deaths deaths 1980 1998 1980 1998 1980 1998 China 18 16 6 8 12 8 Bangladesh 44 28 18 10 26 18 India 34 27 13 9 21 18Pakistan 47 35 15 8 32 27 Sub-Saharan Africa 47 40 18 15 29 25 (Nigeria) 50 40 18 12 32 28 World 27 22 10 9 17 13 SOURCE: World Bank (2000: Table 2.2). on resource use and demographic behavior. I know of no body of empirical work that justifies such presumptions. Population, food, and resources: Why global statistics can mislead How is one to account for these neglects? It seems to me there are four reasons, one internal to the development of the \"new household econom- ics,\" the others arising from limitations in global statistics.TABLE 2 Magnitude of poverty in extremely poor and poor regions, 1985 Extremely poor Poor Number Headcount Poverty Number Headcount Poverty Region (million) index (%) gap (%) (million) index (%) gap (%) Sub-Saharan Africa 120 30 4 180 47 11 East Asia 120 9 0.4 280 20 1 China (80) 8 1 (210) 20 3 South Asia 300 29 3 520 51 10 India (250) 33 4 (420) 55 12 Middle East and North Africa 40 21 1 60 31 2 Latin America and the Caribbean 50 12 1 70 19 1 All developing countries 630 18 1 1,110 33 3 NOTES: The poverty line in 1985 purchasing-power-parity dollars is US$275 per capita per year for the extremely poor and US$370 per capita per year for the poor.Headcount index is the percent of the population below the poverty line. Poverty gap is the minimum amount of additional income, expressed as a percent of GNP, which, if it is distributed among the poor, can eliminate poverty.SOURCE: World Bank (1990: Table 2.1).648 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThe first has to do with the preoccupation of those who developed the new household economics.9 For reasons of tractability they studied choices made by isolated, optimizing households. Such predictions of the theory as that increases in women's labor productivity reduce the household demandfor children are borne out in cross-country evidence (Schultz 1997). Nev- ertheless, the study of isolated households is not a propitious means by which to explore the possibilities of collective failure among households. For ex-ample, there have been few attempts to estimate externalities resulting from reproductive choices. One reason is that the theory of demographic inter- actions in nonmarket environments is still underdeveloped; and withouttheory it is hard for the empiricist to know what to look for. 10 I later point to scattered evidence, drawn from anthropology, demography, economics, and sociology, of externalities resulting from pronatalist attitudes amongrural households in poor countries. I also try to develop some of the ana- lytical techniques that would be required for identifying such externalities. The directional predictions of the resulting theory are not at odds with thoseof the new household economics (e.g., that an increase in women's labor productivity lowers the demand for children); but their predictions differ on the magnitude of household responses. The second reason for the neglect of the population-poverty-resource nexus is the outcome of an inquiry made more than a decade ago into the economic consequences of population growth (National Research Council1986). Drawing on national time-series and cross-regional data, the inves- tigators observed that population size and its growth can have both positive and negative effects. For the purposes of interpreting the data, populationgrowth was regarded as a causal factor in the study. The investigators con- cluded that there was no reason for concern over the high rates of growth being experienced in poor countries. 11 But regression results depend on what is being regressed on what. So, for example, one can set against the National Research Council report more recent cross-country studies by Mauro (1995) and Eastwood and Lipton(1999), who have found a negative correlation between population growth and economic growth and a positive correlation between population growth and the magnitude of absolute poverty. In short, cross-country regressionsin which population growth is a determining factor have given us mixed messages. Later in this article I show that even though we may have learned something from cross-country regressions, they have frequently misdirectedus into asking wrong questions on demographic matters. The third reason stems from a different set of empirical findings. With the exception of sub-Saharan Africa over the past 30 years or so, gross in-come per head has grown in nearly all poor regions since the end of World War II. In addition, growth in world food production since 1960 has ex- ceeded the world's population growth by an annual rate of approximatelyPARTHA DASGUPTA 649 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contents0.6 percent. This has been accompanied by improvements in a number of indicators of human welfare, such as the infant survival rate, life expect- ancy at birth, and literacy. In poor regions each of the latter improvements has occurred in a regime of population growth rates substantially higherthan in the past: excepting East Asia and parts of South and Southeast Asia, modern-day declines in mortality rates have not been matched by reduc- tions in fertility. Table 3 presents total fertility rates (TFR), gross national product (GNP) per head, and growth in GNP per head in several countries and groups of countries. 12 Between 1980 and 1998 the TFR declined everywhere, but very unevenly. Sub-Saharan Africa has displayed the most acute symptoms of poverty: continued high fertility rates allied to declining GNP per head in a very poor continent. Nevertheless, as Table 3 confirms, the oft-expressedfear that rapid population growth will accompany deteriorations in living standards has not been borne out by experience when judged from the van- tage of the world as a whole. It is then tempting to infer from this, as doesJohnson (2000) most recently, that in recent decades population growth has not been a serious hindrance to improvements in the circumstances of living. The fourth reason stems from economic theory and cross-country data on the link between household income and fertility. Imagine that parents regard children as an end in themselves; that is, assume children to be a \"consumption good.\" If, in particular, children are a \"normal\" consumptiongood, an increase in unearned income would lead to an increase in the de- mand for children, other things being equal. This is the \"income effect.\" 13 In his well-known work Becker (1981) argued, however, that if the increase TABLE 3 Total fertility rates and GNP per head in a sample of countries and regions Average annual percentTFRGNP per headagrowth of GNP per headb 1980 1998 1998 1965-98 China 2.5 1.9 3,051 6.8 Bangladesh 6.1 3.1 1,407 1.4 India 5.0 3.2 2,060 2.7Pakistan 7.0 4.9 1,652 2.7 Sub-Saharan Africa 6.6 5.4 1,440 -0.3 (Nigeria) 6.9 5.3 740 0.0 United States 1.8 2.0 29,240 1.6 World 3.7 2.7 6,300 1.4 aDollars at purchasing power parity. bGNP growth calculated from constant price GNP in national currency units.

But other things being equal, this would lead to a decrease in the demand for children (thisis the \"substitution effect\"). It follows that a rise in income owing to an increase in labor productivity would lead to a decline in fertility if the sub- stitution effect were to dominate the income effect, a likely possibility. Figure 1, taken from Birdsall (1988), shows that, among developing countries that in the early 1980s had incomes above US$1,000 per capita, those that were richer experienced lower fertility rates. A regional break-down of even the Chinese experience displays the general pattern: fertility is lower in higher-income regions (Birdsall and Jamison 1983). These are only simple correlations and, so, potentially misleading. Moreover, they donot imply causality. But they suggest that growth in income can be relied upon to reduce population growth. There are three weaknesses with the reasoning just outlined. First, con- ventional indexes of the standard of living pertain to commodity produc- tion, not to the natural-resource base on which production depends. Statis- tics on past movements of world or regional income and agriculturalproduction say nothing about this base. They do not indicate whether or not increases in GNP per head in a country are being realized by means of a depletion of natural capital (e.g., ecosystem functioning).

In relying on GNP and other current-welfare measures, such as life expectancy at birth, infant survival, and literacy, we run the danger of ignoring the concerns ecologists have voiced about path-ways linking population growth, economic activity, and the state of the natu- ral-resource base. 14 It can be shown that the correct measure of a community's welfare over the long run is its wealth, where wealth is the social worth of the entire bundle of its assets, including manufactured, human, and natural capi- tal (Dasgupta and M\u00e4ler 2000). A community's welfare over the long runwould increase only if net investment per head in its capital base were posi- tive. In other words, genuine investment is required if a community's well- being is to be sustainable. Since it is possible for a country's GNP to increaseover an extended period even while its wealth is declining, time series of GNP per head could mislead. 15 Hamilton and Clemens (1999) have provided estimates of genuine sav- ing in a number of countries.16 Among the resources that make up natural capital, only forests, oil and minerals, and pollution were included (not in- cluded were such vital resources as soil quality and water). So there is anundercount. Moreover, the accounting prices used to value natural capital were crudely estimated. Nevertheless, one has to start somewhere. The first column in Table 4 contains estimates of genuine investment as a proportion of GNP in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, China, and sub-Saharan Africa over the period 1970-93. Notice that Bangladesh, Ne- pal, and sub-Saharan Africa have disinvested: their productive base hasshrunk during the period in question. In contrast, genuine investment was positive in China, India, and Pakistan. This could suggest that the latter coun- TABLE 4 Genuine investment and capital deepening in selected countries and regions: 1970-93 I/Yag(L)b g(W/L)cg(Y/L)dg(HDI)e Bangladesh -0.013 2.7 -3.40 -0.2 0.9 a I/Y: genuine investment as proportion of GNP.

But when population growth is taken into account, the picture changes. The second column in Table 4 contains the annual percentage rates of growth of population over the period 1965-96. All but China have experi-enced rates of growth in excess of 2 percent per year. Next I estimate the average annual change in wealth per capita during 1970-93. To do this, I multiply genuine investment as a proportion of GNP by the average out-put-wealth ratio of an economy to arrive at the (genuine) investment-wealth ratio, and then compare changes in the latter ratio to changes in population size. Because a wide variety of natural assets (human capital and variousforms of natural capital) are unaccounted for in national accounts, there is an upward bias in published estimates of output-wealth ratios, which tra- ditionally have been taken to be something on the order of 0.30. In Table 4I have used 0.25 as a check against the upward bias in traditional estimates. This is almost certainly still a conservatively high figure. The third column in Table 4 contains my estimates of the annual per- centage rate of change in per capita wealth. The striking message is that all but China have decumulated their productive base during the past 30 years. Notice how misleading would be an assessment of long-term economic de-velopment in the Indian subcontinent if it were based on growth rates in GNP per head (column 4) or time series of UNDP's Human Development Index (HDI, column 5). Pakistan, for example, would be seen as a countrywhere per capita GNP grew at a healthy 2.7 percent per year, implying that the index doubled in value between 1965 and 1996. Pakistan's HDI also improved over the past decade. Unhappily, though, the average Pakistanibecame poorer (in terms of wealth) by a factor of nearly two during the past quarter-century. The second weakness with reasonings based on Figure 1 is that among poor countries the relationship between per capita income and fertility is not strong. In Figure 1 countries with GNP per head under $1,000 display nearly the entire range of fertility rates prevailing in the early 1980s: from2 to 8 births per woman. Notice that countries lying above the fitted curve are in sub-Saharan Africa, those below are in Asia. I will seek an explana- tion for this. Admittedly, Figure 1 displays a bivariate distribution, whichcould be misleading for a problem requiring multivariate analysis. The fig- ure nonetheless reflects the possibility that among poor households in rural communities the aforementioned substitution effect is not large and can-cels the income effect. This could be because responsibility for childrearing is frequently diffused over the extended family. 17 The third weakness with global statistics is that they are overly aggrega- tive. They gloss over spatial variations and disguise the fact that even though the world economy as a whole has enjoyed economic growth over the past 50 years or so, large masses of people in particular regions have remainedPARTHA DASGUPTA 653 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsin poverty (Tables 2-3). Economic growth has not \"trickled down\" consis- tently to the poorest, nor have the poorest been inevitably \"pulled up\" by it. Population, poverty, and natural resources: Local interactions In view of the aggregative nature of global statistics, a few investigators have studied the interface of population, poverty, and the natural-resource base at the local level. The ingredients of their work have been around for some time; what is perhaps new is the way they have been assembled. Severalmodels have been constructed to develop the new perspective. We are still far from having an overarching model of the kind economists are used to in the theory of general competitive equilibrium. 18 Some models have as their ingredients large inequalities in land ownership in poor countries and the non-convexities that prevail at the level of the individual person in trans- forming nutrition intake into nutritional status and, thereby, labor produc-tivity (Dasgupta and Ray 1986, 1987; Dasgupta 1993, 1997b). Other mod- els are based on the fragility of interpersonal relationships in the face of an expanding labor market and underdeveloped credit and insurance markets(Dasgupta 1993, 1998a, 1999). Yet others are built on possible links be- tween fertility behavior and free-riding on local common-property resources Schreiber 1994;Brander and Taylor 1998). Although the models differ in their ingredients, they have in common a structure that is becoming increasingly familiar from the theory of locally interacting systems. 19 To put it in contemporary termi- nology, the new perspective on population, poverty, and natural resources sees the social world as self-organizing into an inhomogeneous whole, so that, even while parts grow, chunks get left behind; some even shrink. Toput it colloquially, these models account for locally confined \"vicious circles.\" 20 Later in this article I present an outline of this work when seen through a particular lens, namely reproductive and environmental externalities, and I emphasize the arguments that have shaped it and the policy recommen- dations that have emerged from it. The framework I develop focuses on thevast numbers of small, rural communities in the poorest regions of the world and identifies circumstances in which population growth, poverty, and re- source degradation can be expected to interact with one another, cumula-tively, over time. What bears stressing is that my account does not regard any of the three to be the prior cause of the other two: over time each of them influences, and is in turn influenced by, the other two. In short, theyare all endogenous variables. The models under discussion assume that people, when subjected to such \"forces\" of positive feedback, seek mechanisms to cope with the cir-654 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentscumstances they face. The models also identify conditions in which this is not enough to lift communities out of the mire. Turner and Ali (1996), for example, have shown that in the face of population pressure in Bangladesh small landholders have periodically adopted new ways of doing things so asto intensify agricultural production. However, the authors have shown too that this has resulted in an imperceptible improvement in the standard of living and a worsening of the terms of land ownership, the latter probablyowing to the prevalence of distress sales of land. Moreover, as Table 4 sug- gests, Bangladesh has decumulated its assets. These are the kind of findings that the new perspective anticipated and was designed to meet. Economic demographers have given scant attention to reproductive externalities. An important exception was an attempt by Lee and Miller (1991) at quantifying the magnitude of reproductive externalities in a fewdeveloping countries. The magnitude was found to be small. The authors searched for potential sources of externalities in public expenditures on health, education, and pensions, financed by proportional taxation. But suchtaxes are known to be very limited in scale in poor countries. Moreover, the benefits from public expenditure are frequently captured by a small pro- portion of the population. So perhaps it should not be surprising that thereproductive externalities consequent upon public finance are small in poor countries. The externalities I study here are of a different sort altogether. As we would expect from experience with models of complex systems, general results are hard to come by. The models that have been studied analytically are only bits and pieces. But they offer strong intuitions. They suggest also that we are unlikely to avoid having to engage in simulationexercises if we are to study models less specialized than the ones that have been explored so far. 21 This should have been expected. It would seem that for any theoretical inference, no matter how innocuous, there is some setof data from some part of the world over some period that is not consonant with it. 22 More than 40 years of demographic research have uncovered that the factors underlying fertility behavior include not only the techniques thatare available to households for controlling their size, but also the house- hold demand for children. The latter in particular is influenced by a num- ber of factors (e.g., child mortality rates, level of education of the parents,rules of inheritance) whose relative strengths would be expected to differ across cultures, and over time within a given culture, responsive as they are to changes in income and wealth and the structure of relative prices.Thus, the factors that would influence the drop in the total fertility rate in a society from, say, 7 to 5 should be expected to differ from those that would influence the drop from 5 to 3 in the same society. Across societies the matter is still more thorny. The springs of human behavior in an activity at once so personal and social as procreation are complex and interconnected, and empirical testing of ideas is fraught withPARTHA DASGUPTA 655 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsdifficulty. Data often come without appropriate controls. So, what may ap- pear to be a counter-example to a thesis is not necessarily so. Intuition is often not a good guide. For example, one can reasonably imagine that since religion is a strong driving force in cultural values, it must be a factor infertility behavior. Certainly, in some multivariate analyses (e.g., Dr\u00e8ze and Murthi 2000, in their work on district-level data from India), religion has been found to matter (Muslims are more pronatalist than Hindus and Chris-tians). But in others (e.g., Iyer 2000, in her work on household-level data from a group of villages in the state of Karnataka, India), it has not been found to matter. Of course, the difference in their findings could result fromthe fact that the unit of analysis in one case is the district, while in the other it is the household. But such a possibility is itself a reminder that complicated forms of externalities (e.g., externalities arising from conform-ist behavior) may be at work in fertility decisions. Education and fertility control Education and reproductive health programs together are a means for pro-tecting and promoting women's interests. They were the focal points of the1994 United Nations Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and are today the two pillars upon which public discussion on population is based. 23 Later in this article I show that the \"population problem\" involves a number of additional features. Here I review what is known about the influence of education and reproductive health programs on fertility. Women's education and fertility behavior In two classic publications, Cochrane (1979, 1983) studied possible connec- tions between women's education and fertility behavior. She observed that lower levels of education are generally associated with higher fertility. Table 5, based on the Demographic and Health Surveys undertaken in Africa in thelate 1980s, displays this relationship for Botswana, Ghana, Uganda, and Zim- babwe. The finding has proved to be intuitively so reasonable that so cial scientists have attributed causality\u2014from education to reduced fertility. What are the likely pathways of the causal chain? Here are some: Education helps mothers to process information more effectively and so enables them to use the various social and community services that maybe on offer more intensively. The acquisition of education delays the age at marriage and so lowers fertility. In populations with generally low levels of education and contraceptive prevalence, literacy and receptiveness to newideas complement the efforts of reproductive health programs, leading to longer birth spacing. 24 This in turn reduces infant mortality, which in turn leads to a decline in fertility.656 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsTurning to a different set of links, higher education increases women's opportunities for paid employment and raises the opportunity cost of theirtime (the cost of childrearing is higher for educated mothers). Additionally, educated mothers would be expected to value education for their children more highly. They would be more likely to make a conscious tradeoff be-tween the \"quality\" of their children and their numbers (Becker 1981). Yet Cochrane herself was reluctant to attribute causality to her find- ings, as have been investigators studying more recent data (Cohen 1993;Jolly and Gribble 1993), for the reason that it is extremely difficult to estab- lish causality. 25 Women's education may well reduce fertility. On the other hand, the initiation of childbearing may be a factor in the termination ofeducation. Even when education is made available by the state, households frequently choose not to take up the opportunity: the ability (or willing- ness) of governments in poor countries to enforce school attendance or makeavailable good educational facilities is frequently greatly limited. Economic costs and benefits and the mores of the community to which people belong influence their decisions. It could be that the very characteristics of a com-munity (e.g., an absence of associational activities among women, or a lack of communication with the outside world) that are reflected in low educa-TABLE 5 Women's education and fertility rates: Selected countries where lower education is associated with higher fertility Country Education level (years) TFR Botswana none 5.8 1-4 5.55-7 4.78+ 3.4 Ghana Uganda none 7.9 1-4 none 7.2 Jolly and Gribble (1993: Table 3.6).PARTHA DASGUPTA 657 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsTABLE 6 Women's education and fertility rates: Selected countries where primary education is associated with higher fertility Country Education level (years) TFR Burundi none 6.9 1-4 7.15-7 7.38+ 5.8 Kenya none 1-4 none 6.5 4.5 SOURCE: Jolly and 3.6) and Cohen (1993: Table 2.4).tional attainment for women are also those giving rise to high fertility. Demo- graphic theories striving for generality would regard both women's education and their fertility to be endogenous variables. The negative relationship be- tween education and fertility in such theories would be an association, nota causal relationship. The two variables would be interpreted as \"moving together\" in samples, nothing more. In a later section I explore a theoreti- cal framework that offers this interpretation. 26 However, the links between women's education and fertility are not as monotonic as I have reported so far. Set against the positive forces out- lined above is a possible effect that runs the other way: taboos against post-partum female sexual activity, where they exist, can be weakened through the spread of education. In sub-Saharan Africa, where polygyny is widely practiced, postpartum female sexual abstinence can last up to three yearsafter childbirth. It is also not uncommon for women to practice total absti- nence once they have become grandmothers. The evidence, such as it ex- ists, conforms to theory: in Latin America and Asia, primary education, whencompared to no education, has been found to be associated with lower fer- tility, but in several parts of sub-Saharan Africa (e.g., Burundi, Kenya, and Nigeria) the relationship has been found to be the opposite. Table 6 dis-plays the latter. 27 The conventional wisdom that women's education is a powerful force against pronatalism needs to be qualified: the level of edu- cation can matter.658 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsFamily planning Except under conditions of extreme nutritional stress, nutritional status does not appear to affect fecundity (Bongaarts 1980). During the 1974 famine in Bangladesh, deaths in excess of those that would have occurred under pre-vious nutritional conditions numbered around 1.5 million. The stock was replenished within a year (Bongaarts and Cain 1981). Of course, under- nourishment can still have an effect on sexual reproduction, through itsimplications for the frequency of stillbirths, maternal and infant mortality, and a possible reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourse. An obvious determinant of fertility is the available technology for birth control. Cross-country regressions (e.g., Pritchett 1994) confirm that the fraction of women of reproductive age who use modern contraceptives is strongly and negatively correlated with total fertility rates. So it should notbe surprising that family planning programs are often seen as a prerequisite for an effective population policy. But these regression results mean only that contraception is a proximate determinant of fertility, not a causal de-terminant. The results could mean, for example, that differences in fertility rates across countries reflect differences in fertility goals, and thus differ- ences in contraceptive use. Of course, the causal route could go the otherway. The very existence of family planning programs might influence the demand for children, as women come to realize that it is reasonable to want a small family (Bongaarts 1997). People in all societies practice some form of birth control: fertility ev- erywhere is below the maximum possible. Extended breastfeeding and post- partum female sexual abstinence have been common practices in Africa.Even in poor countries, fertility is not unresponsive to the relative costs of goods and services. In a study on !Kung San foragers in the Kalahari re- gion, Lee (1972) observed that the nomadic, bush-dwelling women had anaverage birth spacing of nearly four years, while those settled at cattle posts gave birth to children at much shorter intervals. From the viewpoint of the individual nomadic !Kung San woman, the social custom is for mothers tonurse their children on demand and to carry them during their day-long trips in search of wild food through the children's fourth year of life. Any- thing less than a four-year birth interval would increase mothers' carryingloads enormously, threaten their own capacity to survive, and reduce their children's prospects of survival. In contrast to bush dwellers, cattle-post women are sedentary and are able to wean their children earlier. Traditional methods of birth control include abortion, abstinence or rhythm, coitus interruptus, and prolonged breastfeeding. 28 These options are often inhumane and unreliable; modern contraceptives are in many re-spects superior. Nevertheless, successful family planning programs have proved more difficult to institute than could have been thought possible at first (Cochrane and Farid 1989). Excepting a few countries, fertility rates inPARTHA DASGUPTA 659 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentssub-Saharan Africa have not shown significant decline, despite reductions in infant mortality rates over the past few decades. In a notable article, Pritchett (1994) analyzed data from household surveys conducted by the World Fertility Survey and the Demographic andHealth Survey programs, which included women's responses to questions regarding both their preferences and their behavior related to fertility. De- mographers had earlier derived indicators of the demand for children fromthese data. One such indicator, the \"wanted total fertility rate\" (Bongaarts 1990), can be compared to the actual total fertility rate for the purpose of classifying births or current pregnancies in a country or region as \"wanted\"or \"unwanted.\" Regressing actual fertility on fertility desires in a sample of 43 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Pritchett found that about 90 percent of cross-country differences in fertility rates are associated withdifferences in desired fertility. Moreover, excess fertility was found not to be systematically related to the actual fertility rate, nor to be an important determinant of the rate. The figure of 90 percent may prove to be an over-estimate, but it is unlikely to prove to be greatly so. 29 Even in poor house- holds the use of modern contraceptives would involve only a small fraction (1 percent or thereabouts) of income. Pritchett's finding is significant, if only because it directs us to ask why the household demand for children differs so widely across communities. We turn to this matter next. The household and gender relations The concept of the household is not without its difficulties. It is often taken to mean a unit of housekeeping or consumption. The household in this sense is the eating of meals together by members, or the sharing of mealsderived from a common stock of food (Hajnal 1982). This definition has the merit of being in accordance with most modern censuses, but one problem with it is that in rural communities it does not yield exclusive units (Goody1996). A household shares a \"table\" and may, for example, include live-in servants who do not cook for themselves. In many cases some meals are had in common, while others are not; and often raw and cooked food ispassed to parents in adjacent cottages, apartments, or rooms. The bound- aries vary with context, especially where food is not consumed together round a table (as in Europe) but in bowls in distinct groups (as in sub-SaharanAfrica). In none of these cases is the housekeeping unit the same as the con- sumption unit, nor is the consumption unit necessarily clearly defined. Economists have taken the household to be a well-defined concept, but have debated whether it is best to continue to model it as a unitary entity, in the sense that its choices reflect a unitary view among its mem- bers of what constitutes their welfare (the utility maximizing model) or660 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentswhether instead the household ought to be modeled as a collective entity, where differences in power (e.g., between men and women) manifest them- selves in the allocation of food, work, education, and health care. Of course, one cannot conclude that households are not unitary from the mere observation that intrahousehold allocations are unequal. Poor households would choose to practice some patterns of inequality even if they were unitary. For example, since children differ in their potential, par-ents in poor households would help develop the most promising of their children even if that meant the remaining ones are neglected. This is con- firmed by both theory and evidence (Becker and Tomes 1976; Bledsoe 1994).Daughters are a net drain on parental resources in patrilineal and patrilocal communities, such as those in northern India (dowries can be bankrupt- ing). This fact goes some way toward explaining the preference parents showfor sons there (Sopher 1980a, 1980b; Dyson and Moore 1983; Cain 1984) and why girls of higher birth order are treated worse than girls of lower birth order (Das Gupta 1987). In northern parts of India the sex ratio isbiased in favor of men. 30 Nevertheless, the magnitude of the inequalities frequently observed is at odds with what would be expected in unitary households. The indirectevidence also suggests that the household is a collective entity, not a uni- tary one (Alderman et al. 1995). For example, if a household were unitary, its choices would be independent of which member actually does the choos-ing. But recent findings have revealed, for example, that income in the hands of the mother has a bigger effect on her family's health (e.g., nutritional status of children) than income under the control of the father (Kennedyand Oniang'o 1990). Because gender inequities prevail in work, education, and allocation of food and health care, it should not surprise us that they prevail in fertility choicesas well. Here also, women bear the greater cost. To grasp how great the burden can be, consider that in sub-Saharan Africa the total fertility rate has for long been between 6 and 8 (Figure 1). Successful procreation involves atleast a year and a half of pregnancy and breastfeeding. So in societies where female life expectancy at birth is 50 years and the total fertility rate is 7, women at birth can expect to spend about half their adult lives in preg-nancy or nursing. And we have not allowed for unsuccessful pregnancies. In view of this difference in the costs of bearing children, we would expect men to desire more children than women do. Birth rates are ex-pected to be lower in societies where women are more \"empowered.\" Data from the 1980s on the status of women from 79 so-called Southern coun- tries (see Table 7) confirm this and display an unmistakable pattern: highfertility, high rates of female illiteracy, low women's share of paid employ- ment, and a high percentage of women working at home for no pay all go hand in hand. From the data alone it is difficult to discern which measuresPARTHA DASGUPTA 661 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsare causing high fertility and which are merely correlated with it. But the findings are consistent with the possibility that a lack of paid employment and education limits women's ability to make decisions\u2014a condition thatpromotes high fertility. Household decisions would assume strong normative significance if the household were unitary, less so if it were not. The evidence is that the uni-tary household is especially uncommon when the family is impoverished and the stresses and strains of hunger and illness make themselves felt. De- spite these caveats, I adopt a unitary view of the household in what fol-lows. Because I am concerned here with reproductive and environmental externalities, doing so helps to simplify the exposition without losing any- thing essential. Motives for procreation One motive for procreation, common to humankind, relates to children asends in themselves. We are genetically endowed to want and to value them. It has also been said that children are the clearest avenue open to \"self- transcendence\" (Heyd 1992). Viewing children as ends ranges from the de-sire to have offspring because they are playful and enjoyable, to a desire to obey the dictates of tradition and religion. One such injunction emanates from the cult of the ancestor, which, taking religion to be the act of repro-ducing the lineage, requires women to bear many children. 31 The latter moti- vation has been emphasized by Caldwell and Caldwell (1990) to explain why sub-Saharan African societies have proved so resistent to fertility reduction. The problem with this explanation is that, although it does well to account for high fertility rates in sub-Saharan Africa, it does not adequately explain why the rates have not responded to declines in infant mortality.The cult of the ancestor may prescribe reproduction of the lineage, but it does not stipulate an invariant fertility rate. Since even in sub-Saharan Af- rica fertility rates have been below the maximum possible, they should beTABLE 7 Fertility rates and indicators of women's status in 79 developing countries Women's Women Women's No. of share of paid in unpaid illiteracy TFR countries employment (%) family work (%) rate (%) >7.0 (9) 10.6 46.9 65.7 6.1-7.0 (35) 16.5 31.7 76.95.1-6.0 (10) 24.5 27.1 46.0 30.3 18.1 22.6 SOURCE: IIED/WRI (1987: Table 2.3).662 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsexpected to respond to declines in infant mortality. This is a matter I return to below, where I offer one possible explanation for the resistance that the semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa have shown to fertility reduction.32 But for parents, children are not only an end; they can also be a means to economic betterment. In the extreme, they can be a means to survival. Children offer two such means. First, in the absence of capital markets and social security, children can be a source of private security in old age. Thereis evidence that in poor countries children do offer such security (Cain 1981, 1983; Cox and Jimenez 1992). This fact leads to a preference for male off- spring if males inherit the bulk of their parents' property and are expectedto look after them in their old age. Second, in agriculture-based rural economies children are valuable in household production. Evidence of this is extensive, although such evidenceis, of course, no proof that parents have children in order to obtain addi- tional labor. For example, people could have large numbers of offspring by mistake and put them to work only because they cannot afford to do other-wise. Or large families might be desired as an end in itself, and putting chil- dren to work at an early age may be the only avenue open for financing that end. However, these conjectures are hard to substantiate directly. Theformer is in any case difficult to believe, since it suggests an inability to learn on the part of parents in a world where they are known to learn in other spheres of activity, such as cultivation. But because the latter is not atvariance with any evidence I know, I explore it in a later section. Caldwell (1981, 1982) put forward the interesting hypothesis that the intergenerational transfer of resources flows from children to their parentsin societies experiencing high fertility and high mortality rates, but that it flows from parents to their children when fertility and mortality rates are low. Assuming this to be true, the relationship should be interpreted merelyas an association. The direction of intergenerational resource transfers would be endogenous in any general theory of demographic behavior; thus it would not be a causal factor in fertility transitions. The historical change in the North in parents' attitudes toward their children (from regarding children as a \"means\" to economic ends, to re- garding them simply as an \"end\") can seem to pose a puzzle, as can differ-ences between the attitudes of parents in the North and South today. Some demographers have remarked that a fundamental shift in adults' \"world view\" must have been involved in such changes in attitudes, a shift thatCleland and Wilson (1987) have called an \"ideational change.\" These observers may be right. On the other hand, not only is the expla- nation something of a deus ex machina, it is also difficult to test. A differentsort of explanation, one that is testable, is that children cease being regarded as productive assets when they cease being productive assets. When schooling is enforced, children are not as readily available for household and farm chores.PARTHA DASGUPTA 663 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsIf the growth of urban centers makes rural children less reliable as old-age se- curity (because children are now able to leave home and not send remittances), children cease being a sound investment for parents' old age.33 In short, if chil- dren were to become relatively unproductive in each of their roles as an eco-nomic asset, their only remaining value would be as an end. No change in world view would necessarily be involved in this transformation. The above argument does not rely on economic growth. It involves a com- parison between the productivity of different forms of capital assets. Chil- dren could cease being a sound economic investment even if the economy remained poor. Reproductive and environmental externalities What causes the private and the social costs and benefits of reproduction to differ? One likely source of the distinction has to do with the finiteness of space (World Bank 1984; Harford 1998). Increased population size impliesgreater crowding, and households acting on their own would not be ex- pected to \"internalize\" crowding externalities. The human epidemiological environment becomes more and more precarious as population densitiesrise. Crowded centers of population provide a fertile ground for the spread of pathogens, and there are always new strains in the making. Conversely, the spread of infections, such as HIV, would be expected to affect demo-graphic behavior, although in ways that are not yet obvious (Ezzell 2000). Large-scale migrations of populations occasioned by crop failure, war, or other disturbances are an obvious form of externality. But by their very naturethey are not of the persistent variety. Of those that are persistent, at least four types come to mind. In the remainder of this section I look into them. Cost-sharing Fertility behavior is influenced by the structure of property rights, for in- stance rules of inheritance. In his influential analysis of fertility differences between preindustrial seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Northwest Eu- rope, on the one hand, and Asiatic preindustrial societies, on the other,Hajnal (1982) distinguished between \"nuclear\" and \"joint\" household sys- tems. He observed that in Northwest Europe marriage normally meant es- tablishing a new household, which implied that the couple had to have, bysaving or transfer, sufficient resources to establish and equip the new resi- dence. This requirement in turn led to late ages at marriage. It also meant that parents bore the cost of rearing their children. Indeed, fertility rates inEngland were a low 4 in 1650-1710, long before modern family planning methods became available and long before women became widely literate (Coale 1969; Wrigley and Schofield 1981). Hajnal contrasted this situation664 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentswith the Asiatic pattern of household formation, which he saw as joint units consisting of more than one couple and their children. Parental costs of procreation are also lower when the cost of rearing the child is shared within the kinship. In sub-Saharan Africa fosterage withinthe kinship is a commonplace: children are not reared solely by their par- ents; the responsibility is more diffuse within the kinship group (Goody 1976; Bledsoe 1990; Caldwell and Caldwell 1990). Fosterage in the African con-text is not adoption. It is not intended to, nor does it in fact, break ties between parents and children. The institution affords a form of mutual in- surance protection in semi-arid regions. It is possible that, because oppor-tunities for saving are few in the low-productivity agricultural regions of sub-Saharan Africa, fosterage also enables households to smooth their pat- tern of consumption across time (Serra 1996). 34 In parts of West Africa up to half the children have been found to be living with kin other than their parents at any given time. Nephews and nieces have the same rights of ac- commodation and support as do biological offspring. There is a sense inwhich children are seen as a common responsibility. However, the arrange- ment creates a free-rider problem if the parents' share of the benefits from having children exceeds their share of the costs. From the point of view ofparents, taken as a collective, too many children would be produced in these circumstances. 35 In sub-Saharan Africa, communal land tenure within the lineage so- cial structure has in the past offered further inducement for men to procre- ate. Moreover, conjugal bonds are frequently weak, so fathers often do not bear the costs of siring children. Anthropologists have observed that theunit of African society is a woman and her children, rather than parents and their children. Frequently there is no common household budget for the man and woman. Descent in sub-Saharan Africa is for the most partpatrilineal and residence is patrilocal. Patrilineality, weak conjugal bonds, communal land tenure, and a strong kinship support system of children, taken together, have been a broad characteristic of the region (Caldwelland Caldwell 1990; Caldwell 1991; Bledsoe and Pison 1994). They are a source of reproductive externalities that stimulate fertility. Admittedly, patrilineality and patrilocality are features of the northern parts of the In-dian subcontinent also, 36 but conjugal bonds are substantially greater there. Moreover, because agricultural land is not communally held in India, large family size leads to fragmentation of landholdings. In contrast, large fami-lies in sub-Saharan Africa are (or at least were, until recently) rewarded by a greater share of land belonging to the lineage or clan. Conformity and \"contagion\" That children are seen as an end in themselves provides another mecha- nism by which reasoned fertility decisions at the level of every householdPARTHA DASGUPTA 665 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentscan lead to an unsatisfactory outcome from the perspectives of all house- holds. The mechanism arises from the possibility that traditional practice is perpetuated by conformity. Procreation in closely knit communities is not only a private matter, it is also a social activity, influenced by both familyexperiences and the cultural milieu. Formally speaking, behavior is con- formist if, other things being equal, every household's most desired family size is the greater, the larger is the average family size in the community(Dasgupta 1993: ch. 12). This is a \"reduced form\" of the concept, and the source of a desire to conform could lie in reasons other than an intrinsic desire to be like others. For example, similar choices made by householdsmight generate mutual positive externalities, say, because people care about their status; and a household's choice of actions signals its predispositions (e.g., their willingness to belong) and so affects its status (Bernheim 1994;Bongaarts and Watkins 1996). In a world where people conform, the desire for children is endogenous. Whatever the basis of conformism, there would be practices encour- aging high fertility rates that no household would unilaterally desire to break. Such practice could well have had a rationale in the past, when mortality rates were high, rural population densities were low, the threat of extermi-nation from outside attack was large, and mobility was restricted. But prac- tices can survive even when their original purposes have disappeared. Thus, as long as all others follow the practice and aim at large family size, nohousehold on its own may wish to deviate from the practice; however, if all other households were to restrict their fertility rates, each would desire to restrict its fertility rate as well. In short, conformism can be a reason for theexistence of multiple reproductive equilibria (Dasgupta 1993: ch. 12). These multiple equilibria might Pareto rankable, in which case a commu- nity could get stuck at an equilibrium mode of behavior even though an-other equilibrium mode of behavior would be better for all. Figure 2 depicts fertility choices in a stylized community where house- holds are identical and are conformists and where the government has nopopulation policy in place. The horizontal axis denotes n-, which is the aver- age number of children born per household. It represents the TFR in the community. The vertical axis denotes n*, which is the number of childrendesired by the representative household. 37 Since households are identical, every household is representative. Because n* is a function of n-, we write it as n*(n-). It is drawn as an increasing function, the distinctive feature of conformism. In Figure 2 it is drawn so that it intersects the 45 \u00b0 line at three points, n- 1, n- 2, and n- 3. Each is an equilibrium. To confirm this, imagine for example that each household expects all other households to have n- 3 chil- dren. Then n- 3 will be each household's choice, thus confirming the expec- tations. And so on for n- 1 and n- 2. Notice as well that n- 1, n- 2, and n- 3 are the only equilibria. Let us assume now that out-of-equilibrium households ex-pect the TFR in each period to be the previous period's TFR (this is a special666 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsform of so-called adaptive expectations). It is then easy to check that n- 1 and n- 3 are (locally) stable, while n- 2 is unstable. So our interest here lies in n- 1 and n- 3. I have not offered a micro-foundation for n*(n-). The model is of a re- duced form. But all households may be better off at n- 1 than at n- 3. However, in view of the externality, neither equilibrium is a socially optimal state ofaffairs. 38 The optimal TFR may lie somewhere between n- 1 and n- 3 (say, at n ). If this were so, then from the social point of view TFR would be too low at n- 1 and too high at n- 3. In either situation there would be a need for govern- ment policy (e.g., a tax subsidy) of a kind that would sustain equilibrium TFR at n . In Figure 2 the broken curve is the representative household's desired number of children as a function of the community's TFR when theoptimum policy is in place. It intersects the 45 \u00b0 line at n . These are theoretical possibilities. Analytical reasoning tells us that a society could in principle get stuck at a self-sustaining mode of behaviorcharacterized by high fertility (and low educational attainment), even when there is another, potentially self-sustaining mode of behavior characterized by low fertility (and high educational attainment). 0n- 1 n^n- 2 n- 3 n- n*(n- )FIGURE 2 Desired number of children in a representative household, n*(n- ), as a function of average number of children born per household, (n- )PARTHA DASGUPTA 667 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThis does not mean that the hypothetical society would be stuck with high fertility rates forever. External events could lead households to \"coor- dinate\" at n- 1 even though they had earlier \"coordinated\" at n- 3.39 The exter- nal events could, for example, take the form of public exhortations aimedat altering household expectations about one another's behavior (e.g., fam- ily planning campaigns run by women). This is a case where the commu- nity \"tips\" from one mode of behavior to another, even though there hasbeen no underlying change in household attitudes (n*(n-) has not changed) to trigger the change in behavior. In their aforementioned article Cleland and Wilson (1987: 9) argued that the only plausible way to explain the recent onset of fertility transi- tions among countries at widely different levels of economic development was an ideational change, \"a psychological shift from, inter alia , fatalism to a sense of control of destiny, from passivity to the pursuit of achievement, from a religious, tradition-bound, and parochial view of the world to a more secular, rational, and cosmopolitan one.\" The authors may be right that so-cieties have undergone ideational changes, but they are wrong in thinking that ideational change must be invoked to explain recent fertility transi- tions. The tipping behavior I have just discussed is not a response to ide-ational changes. This said, I know of no evidence that is able to discrimi- nate between the two types of explanation. In addition to being a response to external events, the tipping phe- nomenon can occur because of changes in the peer group on whose behav- ior households base their own behavior. This amounts to the function n*(n-) shifting slowly. Such shifts also may fall short of an ideational change. As Iindicate below, however, the process can precipitate a demographic transition. One pathway by which n*(n-) can shift arises from the fact that people differ in their absorption of traditional practice. Inevitably there are thosewho experiment, take risks, and refrain from joining the crowd. They sub- sequently influence others. They are the tradition-breakers, often leading the way. It has been observed that educated women are among the first tomake the move toward smaller families (see Farooq, Ekanem, and Ojelade 1987, for a commentary on West Africa). Members of the middle classes can also be the trigger, becoming role models for others. Possibly an even clearer pathway is the influence that newspapers, radio, television, and now the Internet exert in transmitting information about other lifestyles (Freedman 1995; Bongaarts and Watkins 1996; Iyer 2000). The ana-lytical point here is that the media may be a vehicle through which a new form of conformism increasingly becomes based on the behavior of a population wider than the local community: the peer group widens. Such pathways can give rise to demographic transitions, in that fertility rates display little or no trend over extended periods, only to cascade down- ward over a relatively short interval, giving rise to the classic logistic curve of668 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsdiffusion processes. To illustrate this, consider Figure 3, which is based on Figure 2. Begin with an isolated community. The curve ABCDE is the rep- resentative household's demand for children as a function of the community's total fertility rate, n*(n-). As with Figure 2, there are three equi- libria, n- 1, n- 2, and n- 3, of which n- 1 and n- 3 are locally stable, and n- 2 is unstable. We are to imagine that households have equilibrated at D, where the total fertility rate is n- 3. Imagine now that the community begins to have expo- sure to the outside world. To grasp the point in the simplest possible way, assume that the rate at which the community is exposed to outside influ- ence (as measured, say, by the rate of increase in the number of televisionsets in the community) is small and steady. It is natural to assume next that, as outside influence increases, n*(n-) shifts downward slowly. This means that the equilibrium TFR declines slowly. In Figure 3 the curveA'B'C'D'E' represents one such transitional demand schedule. The corre- sponding equilibrium TFR is associated with D'. Since D' is locally stable, 0n- 1** n- 1*n- 1 n- A* C B B' B*B\"PARTHA DASGUPTA 669 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthe assumption that the community equilibrates to D' is correct. The underly- ing hypothesis is that outside influence is a slow-moving variable and that the community equilibrates quickly to changes in the extent of outside influence. What would statistical demographers make of the process thus far? They would record that the community's TFR had declined in response to increasing exposure to the outside world. But they would record that the decline was slow. As time passes, the demand schedule in Figure 3 contin-ues to shift downward slowly and the TFR declines slowly, until eventually the schedule attains the position where there are only two equilibria: n- 1* and n- 3*. (The intermediate equilibrium point has vanished at this critical juncture.) This stage is represented by the curve A*B*D*E*. Since the com- munity will have equilibrated at D*, statistical demographers would observe that there had so far been no dramatic decline in fertility. But what happens when the curve shifts down slightly further, say to become the curve A\"B\"E\" in Figure 3? Now the schedule intersects the 45 \u00b0 line only once, at the stable equilibrium B\" (at a TFR of n- 1**). But because TFR had only recently been substantially above n- 1**, households will dis- play disequilibrium behavior for a while, as they \"seek\" n- 1**. Demographers would record a substantial decline in TFR to n- 1**. Subsequent declines in TFR (one such decline is depicted in the lowest curve in Figure 3) again would be observed to be slow. Statisticians would record the period in which TFR declined sharply as a \"demographic transition.\" In our model the tran-sition would be an extended period of disequilibrium behavior. It is worth noting that, in showing how fertility cascades can occur, I have assumed household responses to changes in outside exposure to be nonlinear: theshape of n*(n-) has the nonlinearity built into it. 40 In a pioneering article Adelman and Morris (1965) found \"openness\" of a society to outside ideas to be a powerful stimulus to economic growth.It is possible that the recent fertility reductions experienced in India and Bangladesh (Table 3) were the result of the wider influence people have been subjected to via the media or of attitudinal differences arising fromimprovements in family planning programs. To be sure, fertility reductions have differed widely across the Indian subcontinent (not much reduction in Pakistan so far), but we should not seek a single explanation for so com-plex a phenomenon as fertility transition. 41 Demographers have made few attempts to discover evidence of be- havior that is guided in part by an attention to others. Two exceptions areEasterlin, Pollak, and Wachter (1980) and Watkins (1990). The former stud- ied intergenerational influence in a sample of families in the United States. They reported a positive link between the number of children with whomsomeone had been raised and the number of children they themselves had. In her study of demographic change in Western Europe over the pe- riod 1870-1960, Watkins (1990) showed that regional differences in fertil-670 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsity and nuptiality within each country declined. In 1870, before the large- scale declines in marital fertility had begun in most areas of Western Eu- rope, demographic behavior differed greatly within countries: provinces (e.g., counties and cantons) differed considerably, even while differences withinprovinces were low. There were thus spatial clumps within each country, suggesting the importance of the influence of local communities on behav- ior. By 1960 differences within each country were less than they had beenin 1870. Watkins explained this convergence in behavior in terms of in- creases in the geographical reach national governments enjoyed over the 90 years in question. The growth of national languages could have beenthe medium through which reproductive behavior spread. One recent finding could also point to contagious behavior. Starting in 1977 (when the TFR in Bangladesh exceeded 6), 70 \"treatment\" villageswere served by a massive program of birth control in Matlab Thana, Bang- ladesh, while 79 \"control\" villages were offered no such special service. The prevalence of contraceptive use in the treatment villages increased from 7percent to 33 percent within 18 months, and then rose more gradually to a level of 45 percent by 1985. The prevalence also increased in the control villages, but only to 16 percent in 1985. Fertility rates in both sets of vil-lages declined, but at different speeds, with the difference in fertility rates reaching 1.5 births per woman, even though there had been no difference to begin with (Hill 1992). If we assume that, although influence travels,geographical proximity matters, we could explain why the control villages followed the example of villages \"under treatment,\" but did not follow them all the way. Contagion did not spread completely. 42 Interactions among institutions Externalities are prevalent when market and nonmarket institutions coex-ist. How and why might such externalities affect fertility behavior? A num-ber of pathways suggest themselves (see also Dasgupta 1993, 1999). Long-term relationships in rural communities of poor countries are frequently sustained by social norms\u2014for example, norms of reciprocity.Social norms can be reliably observed only among people who expect to encounter one another in recurring situations. 43 Consider a community of \"far-sighted\" people who know one another and expect to interact withone another for a long time. By far-sighted, I mean someone who applies a low rate to discount future costs and benefits of alternative courses of ac- tion. Assume that the parties in question are not individually mobile (al-though they could be collectively mobile, as in the case of nomadic socie- ties); otherwise the chance of future encounters with one another would be low, and people would discount heavily the future benefits of the cur-rent costs they incur for the purposes of cooperation.PARTHA DASGUPTA 671 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsSimply stated, if people are far-sighted and are not individually mo- bile, a credible threat by all that they would impose stiff sanctions on any- one who broke the agreement would deter everyone from breaking it. But the threat of sanctions would cease to have bite if opportunistic behaviorbecame personally more profitable. The latter would happen if formal mar- kets develop nearby. As opportunities outside the village improve, people with lesser ties (e.g., young men) are more likely to take advantage of themand make a break with those customary obligations that are enshrined in prevailing social norms. People with greater attachments would perceive this and infer that the expected benefits from complying with agreementsare now lower. Norms of reciprocity would break down, making certain groups of people (e.g., women, the old, and the very young) worse off. This is a case where improved institutional performance elsewhere (e.g., growthof markets in the economy at large) has an adverse effect on the function- ing of a local, nonmarket institution: it is a reflection of an externality. When established long-term relationships break down, people build new ones to further their economic opportunities. Those who face particu- larly stressful circumstances resort to draconian measures to build new eco- nomic channels. Guyer (1994) has observed that in the face of deteriorat-ing economic circumstances, some women in a Yoruba area of Nigeria have borne children by several men so as to create immediate lateral links with them. Polyandrous motherhood enables women to have access to more thanone resource network. In his well-known work Cain (1981, 1983) showed that where capital markets are nonexistent and public or community support for the elderly isweak, children provide security in old age. The converse is that if commu- nity-based support systems decline, children become more valuable. But we have just noted that community-based support systems in rural areasmay degrade with the growth of markets in cities and towns. So there is a curious causal chain here: growth of markets in towns and cities can lead to an increase in fertility in poor villages, other things being the same. Earlierwe deduced an influence running in the opposite direction. There we noted that growth of markets in towns and cities, by making children less reliable as an investment for old age, can lead to a reduction in fertility. Only for-mal modeling of the process would enable us to determine which influence dominates under what conditions. Household labor needs and the local commons The poorest countries are in great part agriculture-based subsistence econo-mies. 44 Much labor is needed even for simple tasks. Moreover, many house- holds lack access to the sources of domestic energy available to householdsin advanced industrial countries. Nor do they have water on tap. In semi-672 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsarid and arid regions water supply is often not even close at hand, nor is fuelwood nearby when the forests recede. This means that the relative prices of alternative sources of energy and water faced by poor rural households are quite different from those faced by households elsewhere. In additionto cultivating crops, caring for livestock, cooking food, and producing simple marketable products, household members may have to spend several hours a day fetching water and collecting fodder and wood. These complemen-tary activities have to be undertaken on a daily basis if households are to survive. Labor productivity is low because both capital and environmental resources are scarce. From an early age, children in poor households in thepoorest countries mind their siblings and domestic animals, fetch water, and collect fuelwood, dung (in the Indian subcontinent), and fodder. Mostly, they do not go to school. Not only are educational facilities in the typical rural school woefully inadequate, but parents need their children's labor. Chil- dren between ages 10 and 15 years have been routinely observed to work at least as many hours as adult males (see, for example, Bledsoe 1994; Cleaverand Schreiber 1994; Filmer and Pritchett 1996). The need for many hands can lead to a destructive situation when parents do not have to pay the full price of rearing their children, but in-stead share such costs with their community. In recent years, social norms that once regulated local resources have changed. Since time immemorial, rural assets such as village ponds and water holes, threshing grounds, graz-ing fields, swidden fallows, and local forests and woodlands have been owned communally. As a proportion of total assets, the presence of such assets ranges widely across ecological zones. In India the local commons are mostprominent in arid regions, mountain regions, and unirrigated areas; they are least prominent in humid regions and river valleys (Agarwal and Narain 1989). There is a rationale for this, based on the human desire to reducerisks. Community ownership and control enabled households in semi-arid regions to pool their risks. 45 An almost immediate empirical corollary is that income inequalities are less where common-property resources are moreprominent. Aggregate income is a different matter, though, and the arid and mountain regions and unirrigated areas are the poorest. As would be expected, dependence on common-property resources even within dry re-gions declines with increasing wealth across households. Jodha (1986, 1995), studying evidence from more than 80 villages in 21 dry districts in India, concluded that, among poor families, the propor-tion of income based directly on their local commons is for the most part in the range of 15-25 percent. A number of resources (such as fuelwood and water, berries and nuts, medicinal herbs, resin and gum) are the responsi-bility of women and children. In a study of 29 villages in southeastern Zim- babwe, Cavendish (1998, 1999) arrived at even larger estimates: the pro- portion of income based directly on the local commons is 35 percent, withPARTHA DASGUPTA 673 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthe figure for the poorest quintile reaching 40 percent. Such evidence does not of course prove that the local commons are well managed, but it sug- gests that rural households have strong incentives to devise arrangements whereby they would be well managed. A number of investigators\u2014among them (1995)\u2014have shown that many communities have tradition-ally protected their local commons from overexploitation by relying on so- cial norms, by imposing fines for deviant behavior, and by other means. I argued earlier that the very process of economic development, as exempli-fied by urbanization and mobility, can erode traditional methods of control. Social norms are endangered also by civil strife and by the usurpation of resources by landowners or the state. For example, resource-allocation rulespracticed at the local level have frequently been overturned by central fiat. A number of states in the Sahel imposed rules that in effect destroyed com- munity management practices in the forests. Villages ceased to have au-thority to enforce sanctions against those who violated locally instituted rules of use. State authority turned the local commons into free-access re- sources. 46 As social norms degrade, whatever the cause, parents pass some of the costs of their children onto the community by overexploiting the commons. This is another instance of a demographic free-rider problem. The perception of an increase in the net benefits of having children induces households to have too many. This is predicted by the standard theory of the imperfectly managed commons (see the Appendix). It is also true that when households are further impoverished owing to the erosionof the commons, the net cost of children increases (of course, household size continues to remain above the optimum from the collective point of view). Loughran and Pritchett (1998), for example, have found in Nepalthat increasing environmental scarcity lowered the demand for children, implying that the households in question perceived resource scarcity as rais- ing the cost of children. Apparently, increasing firewood and water scarcityin the villages in the sample did not have a strong enough effect on the relative productivity of child labor to induce higher demand for children. Environmental scarcity there acted as a check on population growth. On the other hand, theoretical considerations suggest that, in certain cir- cumstances, increased resource scarcity induces further population growth: as the community's natural resources are depleted, households find themselvesneeding more \"hands.\" No doubt additional hands could be obtained if the adults worked even harder, but in many cultures it would not do for the men to gather fuelwood and fetch water for household use. 47 No doubt, too, additional hands could be obtained if children at school were with- drawn and put to work. But, as we have seen, mostly the children do not go to school anyway. In short, when all other sources of additional labor674 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsbecome too costly, more children are produced, thus further damaging the local resource base and, in turn, providing the household with an incentive to enlarge yet more. This does not necessarily mean that the fertility rate will increase. If the infant mortality rate were to decline, there would be noneed for more births in order for a household to acquire more hands. How- ever, along this pathway poverty, household size, and environmental deg- radation would reinforce one another in an escalating spiral. By the timesome countervailing set of factors diminished the benefits of having further children and, thereby, stopped the spiral, many lives could have suffered by a worsening of poverty. In the Appendix I provide a simple model toillustrate such possibilities. Cleaver and Schreiber (1994) have provided rough, aggregative evi- dence of a positive link between population increase and environmentaldegradation in the context of rural sub-Saharan Africa; Batliwala and Reddy (1994) for villages in Karnataka, India; and Heyser (1996) for Malaysia. In a statistical analysis of data from villages in the Sindh region in Pakistan,Filmer and Pritchett (1996) tentatively reported a positive link between fer- tility and deterioration of the local natural-resource base. The macroeco- nomic statistics in Table 4 are not at variance with this possibility either. None of these investigations quite captures what the theory I am sketch- ing here tells us to study, namely, the link between desired household size and the state of the local natural-resource base. But they come close enough;limitations in existing data prevent investigators from getting closer to the theory. 48 In any event, these studies cannot reveal causal connections, but, excepting the study by Loughran and Pritchett (1998), they are consistentwith the idea of a positive-feedback mechanism such as I have described. Over time, the spiral would be expected to have political effects, as mani- fested by battles for scarce resources, for example (Durham 1979; Homer-Dixon, Boutwell, and Rathjens 1993; Homer- Dixon 1994). This last connection deserves greater investigation than it has elicited so far. 49 To be sure, families with greater access to resources would be in a po- sition to limit their size and propel themselves into still higher income lev- els. Admittedly, too, people from the poorest backgrounds have been knownto improve their circumstances. Nevertheless, there are forces at work that pull households away from one another in terms of their living standards. Such forces enable extreme poverty to persist despite the growth in wellbe-ing for the rest of society. Institutional reforms and policies If in earlier days social scientists looked for policies to shape social outcomesfor the better, their focus today is more on the character of institutions withinPARTHA DASGUPTA 675 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentswhich people make decisions. But if policies that read well often come to naught in dysfunctional institutions, the study of institutions on their own is not sufficient: good policies cannot be plucked from air. There is mutual influence here, and the task of the social scientist is to study it. Demographers, like economists, seek good news. There is a danger that the recent onset of demographic transitions in parts of the Indian subconti- nent and signs of an onset in some of the urban regions of sub-SaharanAfrica will make demographers complacent. A distinguished student of de- mography remarked to me recently that, in view of the many signs of de- mographic transitions everywhere, the \"population problem\" is now over. But it is not over. The ultimate size of the world's population once the transitions have occurred will matter greatly. There is likely to be a world of difference between a global population of 11 billion and one of 5 billion,even if we ignored differences in their spatial distributions that would in- evitably be implied (Cohen 1995). In this connection, it is worth stressing that some of the externalities I have identified in this article operate mainlyin time, while others operate mainly through time (economists refer to them, respectively, as \"static\" and \"dynamic\" externalities). So even if world population were to stabilize, there would remain externalities whose presence calls forpublic policies. In this article I have identified a number of institutional failures that are allied to pronatalist reproductive externalities. I have done this by try-ing to connect demographic and environmental perspectives. The perspec- tive that emerges tells us that the most potent avenue for reducing the popu- lation problem in various parts of the world involves the simultaneousdeployment of a number of policies, not a single panacea, and that the rela- tive importance of the several prongs depends on the community in ques- tion. Thus, while family planning services (especially when allied to publichealth services) and measures that empower women (through both educa- tion and improved employment opportunities) are certainly desirable, other policies also commend themselves, such as the provision of infrastructuralgoods (e.g., cheap sources of household fuel and potable water), changes to property rights (e.g., the rules of inheritance), means of communication with the outside world (e.g., roads, telephones, radios, television, newspa-pers, and the Internet), and measures that directly increase the economic security of the poor. A number of these policies might well not have come to mind had we studied demographic problems in isolation. In any event, the aim should not be to force people to change their reproductive behavior. Rather, it should be to identify policies and encour- age such institutional changes as would \"internalize\" the externalities I haveuncovered here. Recent declines in fertility rates in the Indian subconti- nent and in parts of sub-Saharan Africa suggest that outside influence, via the media, may have been powerful. Observing lifestyles elsewhere can no676 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsdoubt be unsettling to many, but it can also give people ideas that are salu- tary. To the extent that reproductive behavior is based on conformism, mod- ern communication channels, by linking the village to the outside world, have a powerful effect. But the media are likely to be hampered in arbitraryways except in politically open societies. I have shown elsewhere (Dasgupta 1990; Dasgupta and Weale 1992) that in poor countries political and civil liberties are congruent with improvements in other aspects of life, such asincome per head, life expectancy at birth, and infant survival. Subsequently, Przeworski and Limongi (1995) have shown that these liberties are nega- tively correlated with fertility rates. We therefore have several reasons forthinking that political and civil liberties have instrumental value, even in poor countries; they are not merely desirable ends. But each of the pre- scriptions offered by the new perspective presented here is desirable in it-self and commends itself even when we do not have fertility rates of poor countries in mind. To me this is a most agreeable fact. Admittedly, in all this I have looked at matters wholly from the per- spective of parents. This is limiting. 50 But developing the welfare economics of population policies has proved to be extremely difficult.51 Our ethical in- tuition at best extends to actual and future people; we do not yet possess agood moral vocabulary for including potential people in the calculus. I have tried to argue in this article that there is much we can establish even if we left aside such conceptual difficulties. Population policy involves a good dealmore than making family planning services available to the rural poor. It also involves more than a recognition that poverty is the root cause of high fertility rates. The problem is deeper, but as I have tried to show, it is pos-sible to subject it to analysis. Appendix: The village commons and household size The observation that increases in population size bring in their wake additional pressures on the local natural-resource base is, no doubt, a banality. So, in whatfollows I study the reverse influence: the effect of a deterioration of the local natural-resource base on desired household size. I argued above that villagers' free-riding on the commons can impoverish house- holds in such a way as to create an additional need for household labor. Such aneed would translate itself into a demand for more surviving children if havingmore surviving children were the cheapest means of obtaining that additional la-bor. Of course, this is only one possibility; another is that the receding commonsimpoverishes households in such a way that, at the margin, children become toocostly, with the result that the number of surviving children declines. In this Ap-pendix I offer a formal account of both possibilities. The model outlined enablesus to identify parametric conditions under which the various outcomes would beexpected to occur. I then compare the noncooperative village to a cooperative one.PARTHA DASGUPTA 677 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThe model is timeless. Adjustments over time can then be analyzed in terms of comparative statics. The single household I consider an agriculture-based village economy consisting of N identical house-holds. N is taken to be sufficiently large that the representative household's sizedoes not affect the economy. The model is deterministic. Household size is as-sumed to be a continuous variable, which is a way of acknowledging that realizedhousehold size is not a deterministic function of the size the household sets foritself as a target. Let n be the size of a household. Members contribute to production, but they also consume from household earnings. I aggregate inputs and outputs and as-sume that household production possibilities are such that net income per house-hold member, y(n), has the quadratic form, yn n y n() , , .= + > > 2204 , where , and (1) The quadratic form enables us to capture certain crucial features of a subsistence economy in a simple way, thereby permitting us to draw conclusions easily. Forexample, equation (1) presumes fixed costs in running a household, which is alto-gether realistic: in order to survive, a household must complete so many choreson a daily basis (cleaning, farming, animal care, fetching water and collecting fuel-wood, cooking raw ingredients, and so forth) that single-member households arenot feasible. Equation (1) also presumes that when the household is large, thecosts of adding new members begin to overtake the additional income that is gen-erated. This too is clearly correct. 52 It follows from equation (1) that y(n) = 0 at n= () 242 (2a) is the \"fixed cost\" of maintaining a household, while n- could be interpreted to be the environment's \"carrying capacity.\" I assume that the household \"chooses\" itssize so as to maximize net income per head. Let n* denote the value of n at whichy(n) attains its maximum and let y* denote the n*=2 (3a) and y*.= + 24 (3b) y(n) is depicted as the curve ABC in Figure A-1, where B is the point () 242,+ .678 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsImagine now that the household faces an increase in resource scarcity. We are to interpret this in terms of receding forests and vanishing water holes. The indexof resource scarcity could then be the average distance from the village to theresource base. So, an increase in resource scarcity would mean, among other things,an increase in n-. But it would typically mean more. For example, equations (2a,b) tell us that the household would face an increase in resource scarcity if , , and / were to increase and were to decline in such a way that n- declines. Note too that in this case, both n* and y* would decline (equations (3a,b)). The resulting y(n) is de-picted as the curve A'B'C' in Figure A-1. In short, the increase in resource scarcityshifts the curve ABC to A'B'C'. Consider instead the case where each of , , and increases, but in such ways that n- and n* increase, while n- and y* decline. This is the kind of situation in which a household finds that its best strategy against local resource degradation isto increase its size even while finding itself poorer. The resulting y(n) is depictedas the curve A \"B\"C\" in Figure A-1. In short, the increase in resource scarcity shiftsthe curve ABC to A \"B\"C\". This sort of case was noted originally in Dasgupta andM\u00e4ler (1991) and Nerlove (1991). Social equilibrium I now construct an equilibrium of the village economy.

The perturbations are taken to be sufficiently small so that equation (7)continues to hold in the new equilibrium.680 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsConsider first the case where the perturbation consists of small upward shifts in (M) and (M) and a small downward shift in (M). Notice that if equation (8) holds, both n* and y* would be marginally smaller as a consequence of the pertur-bation. This is the case we would expect intuitively: a small increase in resourcescarcity results in poorer but smaller households. Now consider the case where equation (9) holds. Suppose the perturbation consists of small upward shifts in each of the functions (M), (M), and (M). We can set the relative magnitudes of the shifts such that the small increase in re-source scarcity results in poorer but larger households\u2014that is, y* declines mar-ginally but n* increases marginally. This is the timeless counterpart of the positivefeedback mechanism between population size, poverty, and degradation of thenatural-resource base that was discussed in the text. Such a feedback, while by nomeans an inevitable fact of rural life, is a possibility. In this article I have arguedthat evidence of the experiences of sub-Saharan Africa and the northern Indiansubcontinent in recent decades is not inconsistent with it. Notes This article synthesizes a class of ideas I have developed in Dasgupta (1992, 1993, 1995, 2000). While preparing the article I benefited greatly from discussions with Kenneth Arrow, Robert Cassen, Sriya Iyer, and Karl-G\u00f6ran M\u00e4ler. 1See, for example, Cassen Dyson and Moore (1983), World Bank (1984), Bird- sall (1988), Robey, Rutstein, and Morris (1993), Sen (1994), and Bardhan (1996). 2 See, for example, Boserup (1981), Simon (1989), and Bauer (2000). 3 The I=PAT equation of Ehrlich and Holdren (1971), in which Impact on the envi- ronment is a function of Population, Affluence, and Technology, is used by many to express this concern. 4 The modern classic is Becker (1981). 5 Jones (1998) contains a review of con- temporary growth models. 6 Daily (1997) is a collection of essays on the character of ecosystem services. See also Arrow et al. (1995) and Dasgupta, Levin, and Lubchenco (2000), both of which discuss the implications of the fact that destruction of eco- systems is frequently irreversible. 7 For first-hand accounts of daily life un- der the stresses of resource scarcity, see Agar- wal (1986, 1989) and Narayan (2000). For at- tempts to develop the economics of suchconditions, see Dasgupta (1982, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997a, 1998a, 2000). 8 One of the rare exceptions is Bardhan and Udry (1999). 9 The early works are cited in Becker (1981). Hotz, Klerman, and Willis (1997) sur- vey the field by studying fertility decisions in developed countries. Schultz (1997) makes thorough use of the new household econom- ics for studying the demand for children in poor countries. 10 Surveying the field, Schultz (1988: 417-418) wrote: \"Consequences of individual fertility decisions that bear on persons outside of the family have proved difficult to quantify, as in many cases where social external diseconomies are thought to be important.... The next step is to apply...microeconomic models [of household behavior] to understand aggregate developments in a general equilib- rium framework. But progress in this field has been slow.\" 11 Kelley (1988) contains a review of the findings. See also the survey of empirical growth economics by Temple (1999), who adopts a skeptical view regarding the deleteri- ous consequences of population growth in poor countries. 12 The total fertility rate (TFR) is the num- ber of live births a woman would expect toPARTHA DASGUPTA 681 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentshave if she were to live through her childbear- ing years and to bear children at each age in accordance with the prevailing age-specific fer- tility rates. If the TFR were 2.1 or thereabouts, population in the long run would stabilize. 13 Schultz (1997) confirms this effect for a pooled set of cross-country data. 14 For a fuller discussion see Daily et al. (1998). 15 Wealth per head is the correct index only if production processes are subject to con- stant returns to scale. If they are not, the state- ment in the text needs to be modified (see Dasgupta and M\u00e4ler 2000). I am ignoring such refinements here. For many years environ- mental and resource economists argued that GNP should be replaced by net national prod- uct (NNP) as a measure of social wellbeing so as to accommodate environmental concerns. This argument was wrong: NNP is not an ad- equate welfare measure; wealth is. 16 See also World Bank (1998). Sera- geldin (1995) reported on the World Bank's research program on sustainable development. 17 Dr\u00e8ze and Murthi (2000) have found no effect of income on fertility in a pooled set of district-level data from India. 18 In this respect, the literature I am al- luding to resembles much contemporary eco- nomic theory. 19 Brock and Durlauf (1999) and Levin (1999) offer useful accounts of that structure in a technical and nontechnical manner, re- spectively. 20 Myrdal (1944) called such forms of feedback \"cumulative causation.\" 21 Lutz and Scherbov (1990) offer a thoughtful review of why and how. 22 See Cleland (1996) for a demonstra- tion of this. 23 To illustrate, with a random but rep- resentative example, I quote from a letter to the Guardian newspaper written by Anthony Young of Norwich, UK, on 24 April 2000. Trac- ing the prevailing famine in Ethiopia to over- population relative to Ethiopia's resource base, he writes: \"There is an ethically acceptable set of measures for reducing rates of population growth: improvement in the education and status of women, coupled with making family planning services available to all.\"24 Above low levels of education and con- traceptive use, however, women's education and family planning outreach activities appear to be substitutes. 25 Subsequent to Cochrane's work, stud- ies have found a positive association between maternal education and the wellbeing of chil- dren, the latter measured in terms of such in- dicators as household consumption of nutri- ents, birth spacing, the use of contraceptives, infant and child survival rates, and children's height (see Dasgupta 1993: ch. 12, for refer- ences). As an indication of orders of magni- tude, the infant mortality rate in households in Thailand where the mother had no educa- tion was found to be 122 per 1,000 live births, compared with rates of 39 and 19 per 1,000, respectively, for women with primary and sec- ondary education; see World Bank (1991). However, a common weakness of many such empirical studies is their \"bivariate\" nature. In pooled cross-section data for poor coun- tries in the 1970s and 1980s, Schultz (1997) has found that the total fertility rate is nega- tively related to women's and men's educa- tion (the latter's effect being smaller), as well as to urbanization and agricultural employ- ment; and positively related to unearned in- come and child mortality. This is what the new household economics would lead one to expect. 26 In their careful analysis of district-level data in India from the 1981 and 1991 censuses, Dr\u00e8ze and Murthi (2000) have come the clos- est to claiming that a causal link exists between women's education and fertility. But their study was not designed to test the kind of theo- retical reasoning I am pursuing here. 27 Hess (1988) has conducted time-series analysis that attests to a positive association be- tween primary education and fertility in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. 28 Anthropologists have argued, however, that in parts of western sub-Saharan Africa prolonged breastfeeding is not a birth control measure, but a means of reducing infant mor- tality: traditionally, animal milk has been scarce in the region. 29 I am grateful to John Bongaarts for helpful conversations on this matter. 30 Chen, Huq, and D'Souza (1981) is a pioneering quantitative study on the behav- ioral antecedents of higher female than male682 POPULATION AND RESOURCES Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsmortality from infancy through the childbear- ing ages in rural Bangladesh. See Dasgupta (1993) for further references. It should be noted that stopping rules governing fertility behavior based on sex preference provide a dif- ferent type of information regarding such pref- erence than do sex ratios within a population. To see this, suppose that in a society where sons are preferred, parents continue to have children until a son is born, at which point they cease having children. Assume that at each try there is a 50 percent chance of a son being con- ceived. Now imagine a large population of par- ents, all starting from scratch. In the first round 50 percent of the parents will have sons and 50 percent will have daughters. The first group will now stop and the second group will try again. Of this second group, 50 percent will have sons and 50 percent will have daughters. The first subgroup will now stop and the sec- ond will have another try. But at each round the number of boys born equals the number of girls. The sex ratio is 1. The argument also implies that population remains constant. To confirm this, note that because each couple has exactly one son, couples on average have one son. But because the sex ratio is 1, couples on average have one daughter also. Therefore, the average couple has two children. This means that in equilib- rium the size of the population is constant. 31 Writing about West Africa, Fortes (1978: 125-126) says \"a person does not feel he has fulfilled his destiny until he or she not only becomes a parent but has grandchil- dren.... [Parenthood] is also a fulfillment of fundamental kinship, religious and political obligations, and represents a commitment by parents to transmit the cultural heritage of the community.... Ancestry, as juridically rather than biologically defined, is the primary criterion...for the allocation of economic, po- litical, and religious status.\" See also Goody (1976). Cochrane and Farid (1989) remark that both the urban and rural and the edu- cated and uneducated in sub-Saharan Africa have more, and want more, children than do their counterparts in other regions. Thus, even younger women there expressed a desire for an average of 2.6 more children than women in the Middle East, 2.8 more than women in North Africa, and 3.6 to 3.7 more than women in Latin America and Asia.32 Between 1965 and 1987 the infant mortality rate in a number of the poorest coun- tries in sub-Saharan Africa declined from about 200 per 1,000 live births to somewhere on the order of 150 per 1,000 live births (World Bank 1989). 33 Sundstrom and David (1988) apply this reasoning to parents in the United States prior to its Civil War. 34 This hypothesis could be tested by com- paring the age structure of households that fos- ter out with those that foster in. 35 To see that there is no distortion if the share of benefits and costs was the same, sup- pose c is the cost of rearing a child and N is the number of couples within a kinship. For simplicity, assume that each child makes avail- able y units of output to the entire kinship, which is then shared equally among all couples. Suppose also that the cost of rearing each child is shared equally by all couples. Let n* be the number of children each couple other than the one under study chooses to have. (I presently endogenize this.) If n were the num- ber of children this couple produces, it would incur the resource cost C=[nc+(N-1)n*c]/N, and eventually the couple would receive an income from the next generation equaling Y=[ny+(N-1)n*y]/N. Denote the couple's ag- gregate utility function by the form U(Y)-K(C), where both U(.) and K(.) are increasing and strictly concave functions. Letting n be a con- tinuous variable for simplicity, it is easy to con- firm that the couple in question will choose the value of n at which yU'(Y)=cK'(C). The choice sustains a social equilibrium when n=n*. It is easy to check that this is also the condition that is met in a society where there is no reproductive free-riding. It is a simple matter to confirm that free-riding occurs if the couple's share of the benefits from having chil- dren exceeds their share of the costs. 36 Among the prominent Nayyars of the southern state of Kerala, descent is matrilin- eal. Kerala is noteworthy today for being among the poorer Indian states even while at- taining a TFR below 2. 37 n* is taken to be a continuous variable as a way of acknowledging that realized house- hold size is not a deterministic function of the size the household sets as a target for itself.PARTHA DASGUPTA 683 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contents38 Because households are identical in this stylized model, by a socially optimal state I mean a Pareto optimum. 39 In game theory Figure 2 is called a co- ordination game. 40 Formally, the above is a model of de- mographic transitions viewed as \"relaxation phenomena.\" The mathematical structure I have invoked is similar to one that has recently been used by oceanographers and ecologists in their exploration of tipping phenomena in ocean circulation and lake turbidity, respec- tively. See Rahmstorf (1995) and Scheffer (1997). 41 In this connection, the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh offers an interesting example. Female illiteracy there is a high 55 percent, but some 75 percent of the population has access to radio or television. The fertility rate is now 2.3. 42 I am grateful to Lincoln Chen for a helpful 1996 correspondence on this point. 43 This is the setting studied in the theory of repeated games. See Fudenberg and Tirole (1991). 44 I am thinking of countries in sub-Sa- haran Africa and the Indian subcontinent. In those countries the agricultural labor force as a proportion of the total labor force is on the order of 60-70 percent, and the share of agri- cultural-value added in GNP is on the order of 25-30 percent. 45 In his work on south Indian villages, Seabright (1997) has shown that producers' cooperatives, unconnected with the manage- ment of local commons, are also more preva- lent in the drier districts.46 See Thomson, Feeny, and Oakerson (1986) and Baland and Platteau (1996). 47 Filmer and Pritchett (1996) summarize empirical findings on children's time allocation to household activities in rural areas of poor countries. 48 However, Deon Filmer has informed me that his colleagues at the World Bank have found in a sample of Nepalese villages a posi- tive relationship between (primary) school at- tendance and the availability of local natural resources. 49 Crook (1996) questions the poverty- population link. But because he treats popu- lation density and land productivity as exog- enous variables, his is not quite a test of the thesis. 50 Enke (1966) is a notable exploration of the value of prevented births when the worth of additional lives is judged to be based entirely on their effect on the current genera- tion. As a simplification, Enke took the value of a prevented birth to be the discounted sum of the differences between an additional person's consumption and output over the person's lifetime. 51 I have addressed some of the difficul- ties elsewhere (Dasgupta 1998b). 52 The analysis that follows can be devel- oped more generally, without recourse to the quadratic function. 53 I avoid rigor here and assume (with- out justification) that the optimum is symmet- ric in households.

C ASTERLINE STEVEN W. S INDING \"UNMET NEED FOR family planning,\" which refers to the condition of want- ing to avoid or postpone childbearing but not using any method of contra- ception, has been a core concept in the international population field formore than three decades. Under the label \"KAP-gap,\" for knowledge, atti- tudes, and practice regarding family planning, the concept had its origins in the first fertility and family planning surveys carried out during the 1960s.From the outset the KAP-gap was recognized as a preeminent rationale for investments in family planning programs because of its causal link to un- wanted childbearing. Its central role as a justification for programmatic ef-fort and, more fundamentally, as an organizing concept in international population had if anything solidified during the 1990s. As unmet need has come to occupy a central position, not surprisingly it has been subjected tocareful scrutiny. Skepticism and criticism of the concept\u2014its validity and its utility as a guide for policy formulation and program design\u2014were cogently articulated and gained wide andGermain 1992; Pritchett 1994; Jain 1999). During the same period, a sub- stantial body of new empirical research on unmet need for family planning was completed, and we sense that the broad significance of this researchhas not yet been widely recognized. Our purpose here is to reexamine the utility of unmet need for family planning as an organizing concept for population policies and for reproduc-tive health and family planning programs. Throughout the article our con- cern is the unmet need of reproductive-age women, although later in the article we briefly consider unmet need for family planning of men and, add-692 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsing further complexity, of couples. After reviewing the development of the concept and the debate surrounding it from the 1960s to the present, we address several questions that have been raised about the concept: (1) Is the concept valid, that is, are contradictions between fertility preferencesand contraceptive behavior real? (2) Does unmet need have any bearing on the larger process of fertility transition? (3) What is the correspondence between unmet need, the demand for contraception, and the demand forfamily planning services? (4) Has the concept been too narrowly formu- lated? (5) Is unmet need amenable to programmatic action? (6) What is the role of unmet need in justifying population policies and informing thedevelopment of programs? The first four questions address the meaning of the concept of unmet need, whereas the last two are questions about its utility. In consideringthese questions, we rely heavily on two sets of empirical studies conducted during the past five years. One consists of cross-national analyses of Demo- graphic and Health Surveys (DHS) data, and the other consists of more-localized in-depth studies that have focused on unmet need for family plan- ning and related issues. In most of the studies in this second set, survey interviews were complemented by semistructured qualitative interviews inwhich women and men were asked about their fertility preferences, their success in implementing them, their attitudes toward contraception, and the like. 1 It is curious that, while unmet need for family planning and equiva- lent concepts (e.g., KAP-gap) are now at least three decades old, rigorous investigation of the factors that account for discrepancies between fertility preferences and contraceptive use is a relatively recent development. Background One of the central questions in population policy has been the extent of unintended fertility and, correspondingly, the amount of unsatisfied demand for fertility regulation. The extent of demand for fertility regulation is cru-cial to determining strategies to reduce high fertility. The assumption, often unstated, has been that prevention of unintended pregnancies through con- traception is preferred to prevention of unintended births through inducedabortion, although the impact on aggregate fertility rates is for all intents and purposes the same. From the 1960s onward, most economists (e.g., Kelley 1988) and many demographers (e.g., Davis 1967; Hauser 1969) ques-tioned whether there was sufficient unsatisfied demand for fertility control in high-fertility countries to warrant a family planning services\u2014or \"sup- ply-side\"\u2014approach. To deal with this skepticism and to determine the extent of demand for fertility regulation, surveys on knowledge, attitudes, and practices re- garding family planning were mounted in various parts of the developingJOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 693 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsworld in the 1960s. These so-called KAP surveys (Bogue 1974) showed that in nearly all societies a discrepancy existed between some women's repro- ductive preferences and their contraceptive behavior, that is, there was a KAP-gap (Mauldin 1965; Berelson 1969). In most of these societies, therewas no reason to believe that this gap could be readily closed through in- duced abortion. The identification of the KAP-gap was an important mile- stone in the development of population policies and programs through the1960s, particularly in Asia. The documented existence of a significant group of women who expressed a desire to limit their fertility and who ostensibly would use family planning services if they were available inspired manygovernments to initiate ambitious family planning programs. Nonetheless, much skepticism remained about the actual demand for family planning services. On the basis of analysis of women's responses tothree KAP surveys in Taiwan, Ronald Freedman and colleagues (Freedman, Coombs, and Chang 1972) first identified a subset of women who they ar- gued would be especially receptive to contraception, even without chang-ing the number of children they wanted, because they indicated a desire to terminate childbearing but reported no use of contraception. Two years later, Freedman and Coombs (1974) used survey data from several countries togenerate estimates of the size of this group. Drawing on the social psychol- ogy literature, in which the discrepancy between attitudes and behavior is firmly established (e.g., Ajzen 1993), they called the gap between the \"need\"for family planning services and their use \"discrepant behavior.\" The successor to the KAP surveys of the 1960s was the World Fertility Survey (WFS) program, which began in 1972 and ran through 1984, yield-ing surveys in 41 developing countries. In view of the crucial role of KAP-gap estimates in justifying support for population programs in their formative years, the limited effort of the WFS to broaden or deepen our understand-ing of this phenomenon is surprising. The WFS collected the pertinent in- formation, but generating KAP-gap estimates was viewed as secondary to the goal of providing sound estimates of vital rates (fertility and mortality),the proximate determinants of fertility, and even fertility preferences. None of the 40 \"comparative studies\" produced by the WFS examines the rela- tionship between fertility preferences and contraceptive use. 2 (The WFS did, however, devote systematic effort to the estimation of unwanted fertility; see Lightbourne 1985.) Greater attention was given to the relationship be- tween preferences and contraceptive use in analyses of data from surveysconducted under the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (CPS) project, which ran from 1978 to 1984 (Anderson and Morris 1981; Morris et al. 1981). When the first set of WFS surveys from Asia became available, West- off (1978) produced a five-country study of \"unmet need for family plan- ning,\" the phrase he substituted for \"KAP-gap\" as an indication of his de- termination to develop more-refined measures of the discrepancy between694 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsfertility preferences and contraceptive use.3 This was the first of several stud- ies by Westoff and colleagues. In the first analyses, Westoff excluded preg- nant and amenorrheic women on the grounds that they had no immediate need for contraception. This was one of a number of definitional issues thatsoon came to the fore. Subsequently, Westoff and Pebley (1981) showed that different definitions of unmet need (they specified 12 alternative defi- nitions) produced estimates of the prevalence of unmet need that variedsubstantially (see also El-Zeini forthcoming). They also recommended that the unmet need concept be enlarged to cover the desire to space births as well as to limit childbearing (Westoff and Pebley 1981). The CPS surveys,unlike the WFS, included questions about interest in postponing or spacing births, so that it became possible to calculate the unmet need for spacing as well as for limiting births. A further broadening of the definition was advo-cated by Nortman, who argued that some pregnant, breastfeeding, and amenorrheic women should be included in the definition of unmet need because many would require contraception as soon as their currentnonsusceptible status ended (Nortman 1982; Nortman and Lewis 1984). The Demographic and Health Surveys became the vehicle for consoli- dating these refinements in the measure of unmet need. In the DHS, womenwho want more children are asked how soon they want to have the next birth. The DHS also asks pregnant and postpartum amenorrheic women whether their current or most recent pregnancy was intentional, mistimed,or unwanted (and also whether they were using contraception at the time of conception). With this information, Westoff and his collaborators devel- oped an algorithm that is more complicated than the conventional KAP-gap measures of the 1960s and 1970s and more complicated than the un- met need indicators generated from the WFS, chiefly because it allows for unmet need for the spacing of births and because of the assessment of preg-nant and amenorrheic women, who are included among the women with unmet need if their current or most recent pregnancy was unwanted or mistimed (Westoff 1988). This algorithm, in various formulations that dif-fer only slightly, has been applied to several rounds of DHS surveys in the country reports and in comparative studies (Westoff and Ochoa 1991; West- off and Bankole 1995). The DHS investment in measuring unmet need forcontraception\u2014the care taken in developing intricate algorithms and their application in numerous country and comparative reports\u2014is indicative of the increasing importance the field has attached to unmet need and relatedconcepts. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) remains the contracep- tion parameter of first interest in most quarters, but as time has gone by the prevalence of unmet need has assumed almost equal stature. Because un-met need joins together contraceptive behavior and fertility preferences, the concept represents a marked shift in emphasis, although it is not always recognized as such. An increasing emphasis on unmet need unavoidablyJOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 695 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsbrings with it greater attention to the demand for children, a point we re- turn to below. By the early 1990s, unmet need for contraception was firmly estab- lished as a core concept in the family planning and population policy litera-ture. While the concept was not without its critics\u2014we devote much of the remainder of this article to reviewing the criticisms leveled at the concept\u2014 it appeared to demonstrate widespread demand for family planning serv-ices in many countries and a desire in nearly all societies to restrict fertility below prevailing levels. To be sure, this desire might also be attained through induced abortion, but the same survey data also contained women's admis-sions that substantial fractions of their recent births were unwanted (Lightbourne 1985). This remains so, to varying degrees, in most contem- porary societies (Adetunji 1998), despite the large number of pregnanciesthat are terminated by induced abortion, both safe and unsafe, legal and illegal (Alan Guttmacher Institute 1999). Survey-based estimates of the prevalence of unmet need helped to overcome the skepticism of many schol-ars and policymakers about the existence and extent of demand by indi- viduals for the information and means needed to control their fertility. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the concept helped to accelerate the ex-pansion of family planning services, both as freestanding programs and as integrated components of expanded primary health care services. As preparations began for the 1994 International Conference on Popu- lation and Development (ICPD), advocacy groups for women's health and rights, which had grown in size and determination over the previous two decades, set about using the ICPD as a means to shift the focus of popula-tion programs from demographic goals and targets to women's lives, in- cluding but not limited to their reproductive health (Sen, Germain, and Chen 1994; McIntosh and Finkle 1995). The manifesto of this women's move-ment became the 1994 \"Women's Declaration on Population Policies,\" one of whose main planks was the elimination of demographic targets, quotas, and goals (International Women's Health Coalition 1993). These demo-graphically derived targets, it was argued, led to programs that frequently directed women to obtain unwanted sterilizations and inappropriate meth- ods of family planning, and, in their worst manifestations, resulted in co-ercing women to undergo sterilization or abortion (Garcia-Moreno and Claro 1994). In the event, the concerted effort to redefine the principles underly- ing international population policies and programs was largely successful,as plainly reflected in the ICPD Programme of Action agreed to by more than 180 governments in Cairo in 1994 (McIntosh and Finkle 1995). In retrospect, the preparations for the Cairo conference and the con- ference itself marked a historic redirection of the field. It is ironic that, in the highly charged political context of the early 1990s, the concept of un- met need for family planning\u2014which had its origin in the mainstream family696 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsplanning movement of the 1960s and 1970s\u2014assumed a new function as a bridge between the demographic and reproductive health points of view. From the standpoint of women's reproductive health rights, unmet need was taken as one indicator of the violation of such rights and one of severalbasic rationales for women's empowerment (McCauley et al. 1994; Germain 1997). From the demographic standpoint, an analysis published in 1994 (Sinding, Ross, and Rosenfield 1994) showed that, in nearly all countriesthat had specified demographic targets, fully satisfying the unmet need for contraception would result in contraceptive prevalence rates higher than the established targets. The interpretation placed on this finding was thatpublic policies designed to satisfy existing demand for fertility regulation would obviate the need for targets that might be used as justification for activities that violated human rights. 4 This conclusion reassured many gov- ernments, particularly European governments, that it was possible to achieve demographic goals without pursuing numbers-driven population policies. Rather surprisingly, empirical analysis seemed to have dissolved the assumedtension between individual and collective interests that had troubled the field for decades (Demeny 1986). In the ICPD Programme of Action, unmet need for family planning receives explicit mention as a core rationale forpopulation programs, and the document goes on to say: \"Governmental goals for family planning should be defined in terms of unmet needs for informa- tion and services.... All countries should, over the next several years, assessthe extent of national unmet need for good-quality family-planning serv- ices...\" (United Nations 1994: paragraphs 7.12 and 7.16). Reducing unmet need became a target in itself, rather than a means for achieving demo-graphic goals (Sai 1997). In hindsight, the period surrounding the Cairo conference may have been a high-water mark for unmet need as an organizing concept in theinternational population field. 5 Some decline in enthusiasm for the con- cept follows inevitably from the lesser emphasis on family planning, as com- pared to other reproductive health issues, in the post-ICPD period. Belowwe consider whether unmet need for contraception has been too narrowly defined. Clearly there is scope for enlarging the concept, but it remains in- trinsically a family planning concept, and thus it seems unavoidable thatunmet need will become less compelling as family planning is seen as a less urgent priority and as an increasing portion of the need for family planning is satisfied. As the term has gained wider currency, there have also been unfortu- nate misunderstandings of what it signifies. For many the term is not self- evident; and it is even offensive to some, especially nonspecialists. Evenamong specialists, many economists appear to be offended by the notion that any real need goes unmet. We consider this dispute at greater length in the next section. For others, resistance may reflect not so much a confu-JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 697 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentssion about the concept of unmet need for family planning as a legitimate difference in social policy priorities in the face of finite resources. For ex- ample, in research conducted in 1996, officials from selected European de- velopment agencies\u2014nearly all of them nonspecialists\u2014most commonlyreacted to the term with the comment that there are many unmet needs in the development field, among which family planning services is just one (Market and Opinion Research International 1997). The ranking of more-effective fertility control (whether to serve individual or collective inter- ests) as against other health and societal needs is a paramount public policy question that is, however, outside the bounds of this discussion. More-focused misgivings about the concept have been articulated in the research literature, and it is to these that we devote the remainder of this article. Some of these echo skepticism about unmet need first expressedin the 1960s (with reference to the KAP-gap and repeated frequently up to the present), others are of more recent origin. In what follows, we lean heavily on recent empirical research. Validity of the concept Perhaps the most fundamental challenge to the concept of unmet need is the assertion that it does not refer to a valid behavioral phenomenon. This argument takes several forms, all of which share the premise that the dis-crepancy to which unmet need refers is illusory: it is an artifact of survey measurement and/or the algorithms that analysts apply to survey data; or, even if it accurately captures an apparent inconsistency between prefer-ences and behavior, this contradiction exists only in the eyes of the data analyst, not in the experience of women and men, who perceive no contra- diction between their fertility preferences and their reproductive behavior. A rudimentary version of this argument dismisses survey-based mea- sures of fertility preferences. This view was prominent in the early days of fertility surveys (Hauser 1967), but has essentially been refuted by the cu-mulative weight of empirical research over the past three decades showing that survey data on fertility desires possess substantial validity, as assessed either at the aggregate or the individual level (Westoff and Ryder 1977;Hermalin et al. 1979; Westoff 1990; 1991; Tan and Tey 1994; Bankole and Westoff 1998). Hence the major participants in the more re- cent debate about unmet need have not questioned the overall validity ofpreference data. 6 Instead, the discussion has shifted to the question of whether unmet need has any correspondence with the expressed experiences of individu-als or, instead, is a construct imposed on women in quantitative analysis conducted in research centers far removed from the communities where the survey interviews were carried out. Note that in the DHS and similar698 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentssurveys, women are not asked directly whether they perceive an inconsis- tency between their fertility preferences and contraceptive practice; rather the discrepancy is identified by the analyst through the comparison of re- sponses to items in separate blocks of the questionnaire. In this sense un-met need is an inference on the part of the researcher, not a condition re- ported by the respondents themselves. The inference is twofold: that women who state a desire to postpone or terminate childbearing would like to takeactions to avoid births, and that this should take the form of contraception rather than induced abortion (or any other actions women assume prevent births). The most direct evidence that unmet need is real is the high incidence of pregnancies that are reported as unintended and\u2014proof that induced abortion does not explain away unmet need\u2014the large number of birthsthat are reported as unwanted. With all the attention given to unmet need during the past decade, it is easy to forget that it is the desirability of pre- venting unintended pregnancies that justifies the focus on unmet need(Yinger 1998). Roughly one-fifth to one-quarter of births in the developing world are unwanted, as measured by women's direct responses in surveys to a question about the wantedness of their most recent pregnancy (Bon-gaarts 1997b). In all likelihood this is an underestimate of unwanted births, because longitudinal survey data reveal women's tendency for ex post revi- sion of their preferences in favor of the wantedness of existing children(Bankole and Westoff 1998). Furthermore, because a substantial fraction of pregnancies are terminated through induced abortion (Alan Guttmacher Institute 1999), the fraction of pregnancies that are unwanted must be evenhigher than the fraction of births that are unwanted. A further fraction of recent births are reported as having occurred sooner than desired. Women's willingness to report that large numbers of recent births were unwanted ormistimed is difficult to reconcile with the argument that unmet need oc- curs only in the minds of researchers and policymakers. This debate does not answer the question of whether the existence of unmet need has any immediate salience for women and men. Several re- cent empirical studies have been revealing on this point. As some have sur- mised (e.g., Pritchett 1994), a substantial minority of women classified ashaving unmet need perceive themselves to be at low risk of conceiving. Current practice is to exclude infecund women\u2014that is, women who are thought to be unable to bear any (more) children\u2014from the category ofunmet need. Many women who are classified as fecund, however, may re- gard themselves as being at sharply diminished risk of pregnancy, either because they infrequently engage in sexual intercourse or because they feel(correctly or incorrectly) that their fecundability is low. In a comparative analysis of DHS data, Westoff and Bankole (1995) show that low perceived risk of conceiving accounts for a substantial fraction of unmet need in manyJOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 699 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentscountries. In more-localized in-depth studies of unmet need, the same find- ing emerges in the Philippines (Casterline, Perez, and Biddlecom 1997), Gua- temala (Asturias de Barrios et al. 1998), Egypt (El-Zanaty et al. 1999), and Nepal (Stash 1999) but appears to be of less importance in Pakistan (Cast-erline, Sathar, and Haque forthcoming). In sub-Saharan Africa, a large frac- tion of women classified as having unmet need for birth spacing report that they are in postpartum abstinence (Westoff and Bankole 1995). It shouldnot be surprising that women who, correctly or incorrectly, perceive them- selves at low risk of conceiving see little reason for coping with the various costs and inconveniences of using contraception. Judging from these em-pirical studies, perception of a low risk of conceiving typically accounts for something on the order of 10-25 percent of the estimated unmet need for family planning. This is a nontrivial percentage, but hardly enough to in-validate the concept. Equally revealing are the qualitative interviews conducted as part of the same set of in-depth studies. One line of questioning common to thesestudies was to ask women and men about their fertility preferences and their success in implementing them, in effect probing into their self-percep- tion of unmet need for more effective fertility regulation. In all settings, it isclear that many women and men feel frustrated by their inability to adopt behaviors that would effectively prevent unintended pregnancies. Some in- dividuals articulate the obstacles (deficiencies in the service environment,social barriers, and so forth) to implementing their preferences in fertility- regulation behavior, while others express only vague frustration that easily slips into resignation. Whether or not obstacles are identified, the transcriptsfrom these qualitative interviews leave the reader with a sense of individu- als' dissatisfaction with their ability to regulate their fertility. 7 Furthermore, a willingness to rely on induced abortion, instead of contraception, as ameans of preventing unintended births is not expressed commonly in any of these settings. It is not possible from these studies to determine what fraction of women classified as having unmet need for contraception per-ceive themselves to be in that condition, but the cumulative impression is that it is a majority, not a minority, of such women. The argument that unmet need is entirely a fiction devised by the survey analyst is effectivelyrefuted by this qualitative research. It is important to establish the fundamental validity of unmet need, and in so doing respond to two sets of criticism. The first criticism, commonamong economists, is that the concept is illogical: if individuals truly wish to regulate their fertility, they will find a means to do so. Under conven- tional economic theory, unmet need (which economists understandably con-fuse with unmet demand) can be viewed as a temporary disequilibrium that market forces would correct in short order. By this reasoning, nonuse of contraception simply demonstrates a lack of sufficient motivation (Demeny700 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contents1975; Pritchett 1994). The second criticism is that the concept of unmet need is patronizing (Pritchett 1994). Both criticisms originate in misunderstandings of unmet need that can be attributed to the simplistic theorizing, and in many cases sheer absenceof a sound behavioral model, in much of the mainstream research on un- met need. The key concept that has not been routinely articulated in this literature is preferences operating under constraints or, alternatively, competing preferences . Social scientists who have studied the relationship between atti- tudes, motivation, and behavior have long recognized that strongly held preferences will often not have direct behavioral counterparts because ofobstacles to the implementation of those preferences or because other pref- erences overrule them (e.g., see Chaiken 1998; Dawes 1998; and Pittman 1998). 8 By no means does this diminish the reality of the contradiction between preferences and behavior; rather, it explains how it can come about. The in-depth empirical studies of unmet need carried out during the past five years provide concrete verification, inthe case of contraception, of the validity of the decisionmaking models pro- posed in the social psychology literature. In diverse settings, preferences to avoid pregnancy are stymied by various constraints and obstacles, most no-tably fear of health side effects and social opposition (e.g., from one's spouse); 9 hence, it is not surprising that a substantial fraction of pregnan- cies are reported as unintended. Stash (1999) describes the deliberate weigh-ing of costs and ben efits of using contraception in Nepal, with the frequent result that women and men do not use a method despite a clear desire to avoid pregnancy. In short, unmet need is not illogical, nor does it presume irrationaldecisionmaking. Unmet need and fertility transition A different line of argument questions the aggregate-level validity of theconcept of unmet need. At issue is whether unmet need, as currently de-fined and measured, has any observable association with trends over time in contraceptive prevalence and fertility. If, the reasoning goes, unmet need correctly depicts a state of contradiction between fertility preferences andcontraceptive practice, then adoption of contraception should be one of the common resolutions (induced abortion would be another). These individual- level decisions, in turn, when aggregated should result in an increase incontraceptive prevalence and a decrease in fertility (because of reduced rates of unintended pregnancies). If, however, changes in contraceptive preva- lence and fertility rates are attributable mainly to changes in fertility de-sires, then unmet need would be an insignificant concept from the stand- point of explaining observed variation of fertility over time and space and, hence, of limited utility as an organizing concept for population policy.JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 701 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThis point of attack is adopted by Pritchett (1994) in an influential article.10 Citing the strong cross-sectional and over-time correlation between desired and actual fertility at the country level since 1970, Pritchett con- cludes that fertility decline is due almost entirely to changes in fertility de-sires, hence there is limited scope for affecting fertility through the reduc- tions in unwanted fertility that would follow from satisfying unmet need. Pritchett's argument is persuasive, and in fact few scholars would disputehis assertion that the fundamental force underlying fertility decline is a re- duction in the number of births desired, itself a response to factors such as improvements in child survival, changes in the structure of the economy,and so forth. In building his argument Pritchett draws on evidence from a diverse set of empirical studies, using the various pieces of evidence to complement and reinforce each other. The linchpin in his case, however, isthe fact that trends in actual fertility closely track trends in desired fertility. Or, equivalently, over the course of fertility transition the level of unwanted fertility is relatively stable. From this Pritchett draws the inference that reductions in unwanted fertility must contribute very little to fertility decline. In drawing this inference he is mistaken, as Bongaarts (1997a, 1997b) shows through a simple model ofreproductive behavior. Bongaarts's model distinguishes between the unwanted fertility rate calculated with all women of reproductive age serving as the de- nominator and the fertility rate among the smaller group of women who want to terminate childbearing (by definition the only source of unwanted births). Absent reductions in the fertility rate among this latter group of women, unwanted fertility calculated for all women will increase in the early andmiddle stages of fertility transition, primarily because declines in desired family size place a larger fraction of women at risk of an unwanted birth. Put otherwise, if unwanted fertility rates are relatively unchanging over timeamong all women of reproductive age, a reduction in unwanted fertility can only occur if fertility rates fall among the growing subset of women who want to stop childbearing. Pritchett draws the wrong conclusion fromhis empirical evidence: rather than demonstrating that fertility decline is almost entirely a result of reductions in the demand for children, his evi- dence is more consistent with a historical process in which a reduction infertility among those at risk of unwanted births makes a disproportionate contribution to the overall fertility decline. This avoidance of unwanted births, in turn, was achieved largely through the adoption of contraception,as is plainly demonstrated through a substantial body of survey data. A recent article provides direct empirical evidence of the decisive con- tribution to contemporary fertility declines of satisfaction of unmet need.Feyisetan and Casterline (2000) examine changes in contraceptive preva- lence in 26 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America between the late 1970s and the late 1990s. Using individual-level survey data on fertility pref-702 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentserences and contraceptive use, the authors determine what fraction of the observed change in contraceptive prevalence can be accounted for by changes in fertility preferences (i.e., demand-driven change) and what fraction is accounted for by increasing rates of use within preference categories (i.e.,change due to satisfying unmet need, or, equivalently, due to increased implementation of fertility preferences). In all 26 countries, increasing rates of contraceptive use within preference categories account for a majority ofthe increase in prevalence (ranging from 61 percent in Ghana to 96 percent in Colombia). Changes in fertility preferences, by contrast, account for only about 20 percent of the increase in prevalence on average, and in none ofthe 26 countries do they explain more than 40 percent of the increase. The clear conclusion is that substantial increases in contraceptive prevalence (and, by this means, substantial declines in fertility) can be achieved in the ab-sence of changes in the demand for children, through the satisfaction of already-existing demand for fertility regulation. 11 This research lends validity to the concept of unmet need and repre- sents the aggregate-level counterpart to the individual-level phenomenon, evident in the qualitative research cited above, of a contradiction between fertility preferences and contraceptive behavior that individuals recognizeand seek to resolve. Unmet need and the demand for family planning Beginning with the first efforts to devise survey-based estimates of unmetneed, one of the most compelling incentives has been that these might serveas estimates of latent, or unsatisfied, demand for family planning (or, going a step further, demand for family planning services). Trustworthy estimates of latent demand would clearly have considerable practical utility for a num-ber of disparate purposes (ranging from demographic projection to the allo- cation of program resources). Up to the present, it has been common to equate unmet need and latent demand for family planning. As one example,the penultimate DHS comparative analysis of unmet need is entitled Unmet Need and the Demand for Family Planning (Westoff and Ochoa 1991), and even the most recent DHS comparative analysis makes frequent use of the no-tion of \"total demand for family planning,\" which is defined as the sum of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need (Westoff and Bankole 1995). Analyses such as that of Sinding, Ross, and Rosenfield (1994), which showsthat satisfaction of existing unmet need through contraception would, in itself, result in the attainment of established targets for contraceptive preva- lence and fertility in most countries, implicitly assume that unmet need rep-resents latent demand for family planning. Several criticisms that can be leveled at the conclusions of Sinding et al. and similar exercises derive from skepticism that unmet need is equiva-JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 703 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentslent to latent demand for contraception. One criticism is that satisfaction of all unmet need is unattainable in the short term, rendering the hypotheti- cal calculations in Sinding et al. of little practical value. A second criticism is that unmet need is a poor proxy for the near-term demand for family plan-ning (and, more specifically, family planning services), as compared to other available indicators. We consider the two arguments in turn. Beginning with the first criticism, undoubtedly many women with un- met need are unlikely to adopt contraception any time soon, not so much be- cause of their lack of access to services but rather because of their extreme reluctance to use contraceptives, either because of their perception of a lowrisk of conceiving or because of social, cultural, and health concerns (Pritchett 1994). This point is buttressed by empirical research, reviewed below, on reasons for unmet need. Even if it were correct from an analytical stand-point to regard women with unmet need as having latent demand for con- traception, as a practical matter the reasons many women have for not us- ing contraceptives are so firmly established that contraceptive practice anytime soon, or ever, is extremely unlikely. By this line of reasoning, the cal- culations in Sinding et al. exaggerate the potential demographic impact of any determined effort to satisfy unmet need. But from this does it followthat estimates of unmet need can be dismissed as simply uninformative about latent demand for family planning? A more balanced view is that some frac- tion of the estimated unmet need does indeed represent latent demand forfamily planning that is susceptible to conversion into contraceptive use. This last view governs the DHS analysis by Westoff and Bankole (1996), who consider several scenarios in which only a subset of women with un-met need adopt contraception. In particular, if one assumes that only those women with unmet need who state an intention to use contraception in the future are prepared to adopt\u2014arguably a conservative assumption\u2014this still implies an increase in contraceptive prevalence of 60 percent on average (nearly 100 percent in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where preva- lence starts from low levels, and around 20 percent elsewhere), and an av-erage decline in the total fertility rate (TFR) of 15 percent. Although this may seem a modest reduction in the TFR, in the majority of countries it represents 20 percent to 50 percent of the distance to replacement-levelfertility. The primary conclusion to be drawn from Westoff and Bankole's analysis is that substantial demographic impact would follow from satisfy- ing a fraction of existing unmet need. Under plausible (if ambitious) scenarios, a compelling demographic rationale for a focus on unmet need remains, and the key conclusions of Sinding et al. are confirmed. The approach taken by Westoff and Bankole is ultimately unsatisfy- ing, because the choice of the fraction of unmet need that represents a con- scious demand for family planning is arbitrary. This shortcoming is a major motivation for conducting experimental studies, such as the highly influ-704 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsential Matlab project in Bangladesh,12 that ascertain how women and men with unmet need respond to specific modifications of their environment. For now, we must settle for an imperfect understanding of the relationship between unmet need and the demand for family planning. Only if it werefeasible to make contraceptive practice cost-free (with costs broadly defined to include cultural, social, and health costs as well as financial and time costs) would it be correct to regard all women and men with unmet need ashaving a latent demand for family planning that could readily become mani- fest. Short of that ideal and unrealizable condition, the category \"unmet need\" is composed of women who vary considerably in their demand forfamily planning. Some of these women desire to practice contraception un- der present circumstances or a change of circumstances that is within reach, while others would be prepared to use contraception only if significant fea-tures of their present circumstances could be modified. Some may prefer to rely on induced abortion, although there is considerable evidence that in most societies most women prefer contraception to abortion as a means ofpreventing births. How easily unmet need can be converted into use of con- traception is a function of the nature and strength of the obstacles preventing implementation of preferences, and these will vary from setting to setting. Oncethis is recognized, clearly it is a mistake to link the validity of the concept of unmet need to its success in capturing demand for family planning. 13 This leads to the second criticism of using unmet need as a proxy for demand for contraception, namely that better indicators are available. To ascertain the fraction of women and men with conscious demand, the most direct measure provided by surveys is the intention to use contraception inthe future, typically an item asking the respondent whether she or he in- tends to use any time in the future or, more usefully, within the next 12 months. Prospective studies have demonstrated a strong correspondencebetween the intention to use and subsequent contraceptive behavior (e.g., Adler et al. 1990; Bhatia 1982; Curtis and Westoff 1996). Of particular rel- evance to our argument, recent analyses of DHS data by Ross and Heaton(1997) and Ross, Stover, and Willard (1999) show that a substantial frac- tion of nonusers who intend to use are not captured by conventional defi- nitions of unmet need. If the aim is to estimate short-term demand for fam-ily planning, then the sum of contraceptive prevalence (with some allowance for discontinuation) and those intending to use is a more valid indicator than the sum of contraceptive prevalence and the prevalence of unmet need,even allowing for some failure to use among those stating an intention to use, because of the types of obstacles we have alluded to earlier. 14Note that this constitutes a departure from the logic of the algorithms developed byWestoff and colleagues. Those algorithms are assiduously cross-sectional in their frame of reference; their aim is to estimate unsatisfied need for preg- nancy avoidance as of the date of the survey interview, not in the succeed-JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 705 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsing months or years. When assessing the short-term demand for family plan- ning services, in contrast, one must include sexually inactive women who might soon become active: for example, adolescents and women practicing postpartum abstinence. This concern has motivated the development of al-gorithms for estimating future demand that take into account reproductive dynamics (e.g., Nortman and Lewis 1984). Broadening the definition One criticism leveled with increasing frequency at the concept of unmet need for family planning is that the concept is too narrow. Many advocates for women's health and rights argue that unmet need is a misleading term because, as presently defined, it neglects reproductive health needs otherthan preventing births and neglects potential clients other than married women (Dixon-Mueller and Germain 1992; Dixon-Mueller 1993). In the sharpest versions of this criticism, unmet need is seen as a device that de-mographers have used to justify the expansion of family planning services for the purpose of reducing fertility\u2014a Trojan horse for implementing de- mographic policies. According to these critics, reference to unmet need sus-tains a focus on numbers that has led to an expansion of services which do little to improve the reproductive health of women. By emphasizing demo- graphic rather than health outcomes, proponents of unmet need perpetu-ate programs that serve women's health needs poorly and at worst are co- ercive (Hartmann 1987). Less radical versions of this criticism contend that the standard measure of unmet need fails to take into account the degreeto which women are dissatisfied with their present method of contracep- tion and with the quality of services through which methods are provided. These critics argue that unmet need should include qualitative as well asquantitative dimensions (Bruce 1990). Contraceptive users may still have family planning needs, and high contraceptive prevalence rates can coexist with the persistence of significant unmet family planning needs. Some of these arguments, when examined more closely, do not iden- tify shortcomings in the concept of unmet need for family planning per se, nor deficiencies in the way the concept has been applied, but rather consti-tute a rejection of the priority placed on family planning compared with other reproductive health behaviors and services. This is a legitimate stance to take, but is outside the scope of this discussion. We assume that preven-tion of unintended pregnancies is a widespread goal of women and men, that contraceptive practice is a principal mechanism for pregnancy preven- tion, and that it is appropriate for public policies and programs to be devel-oped that facilitate individuals' avoiding unintended pregnancies. How this goal ranks against other reproductive health goals\u2014for individuals, for larger collectivities\u2014is a separate matter. We see nothing intrinsic to the concept706 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsof unmet need for family planning that requires contraception for the pur- pose of pregnancy prevention to be regarded as of higher or lower priority than other health needs. Concepts analogous to \"unmet need for family planning\" that refer to other types of reproductive health needs can cer-tainly be proposed, accompanied by the development of appropriate tech- niques for measuring their prevalence empirically (Omran et al. 1992; Short 1994). Moreover, in many settings a necessary ingredient in the improve-ment in the quality of family planning services is enhanced sensitivity to women's broader reproductive health needs. Reproductive morbidity often discourages women from adopting or continuing to use contraception. Inthis sense, family planning and broader reproductive health agendas are not at odds with each other, indeed can be highly synergistic. A priority on reducing unmet need for family planning is by no means hostile to givingsimilar priority to meeting other reproductive health needs. Beyond these larger issues of philosophy and purpose, we see consid- erable practical value in retaining a concept that focuses on family planningfor the purpose of pregnancy prevention. In the same vein, we also favor retaining individual fertility preferences as the criterion for ascertaining the existence of unmet need for contraception. Some have proposed alterna-tive definitions that use various health-risk criteria\u2014for example, the woman's age and parity, regardless of her desire to postpone or terminate childbearing (DeGraff and de Silva 1996)\u2014but we view these as fundamen-tally different, albeit legitimate, bases for determining unmet need. 15 The emphasis on individual reproductive aspirations is a hallmark of the con- cept of unmet need for family planning that emerged several decades ago. Even given our adherence to this concept of unmet need, however, we recognize significant deficiencies in the empirical research to date. The underlying rationale for the concept is that unintended pregnancies are anundesirable outcome (Yinger 1998; Jain 1999). Obviously, married women are not the only persons at risk of unintended pregnancies: unmarried women and men (whether married or unmarried) are also at risk. Despitethe calls of Dixon-Mueller and Germain (1992) and others to enlarge the definitions of unmet need to encompass these other groups, progress in this direction has been disappointing. 16 The most recent DHS comparative analy- sis of unmet need contains estimates for unmarried women in most coun- tries, but, as the authors concede, the estimates rest on a number of debat- able assumptions (Westoff and Bankole 1995). The challenge in studyingunmet need for family planning among unmarried women is, first, mea- suring sexual exposure (which is assumed for married women, although clearly this is not always the case) and, second, measuring fertility prefer-ences. Both pieces of information are less easily obtained from unmarried individuals in most settings. Another practical obstacle is that ordinarily the data-collection instruments for the unmarried must be substantially differ-JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 707 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsent from the instruments for the married, because questions about fertility desires, pregnancy and childbearing experience, contraceptive knowledge and practice, and so forth must be tailored to their different life situation. The concept of unmet need for family planning is as straightforward when applied to men as to women: like women, men may wish to post- pone or terminate their reproduction. Obviously, the consequences of preg- nancy are different for men than for women, but this does not modify thebasic concept of unmet need. The major complication with men is that they can father children with more than one woman, hence in theory their un- met need is woman-specific. This means that in empirical research infor-mation must be obtained about men's fertility preferences and contracep- tive practice partner-by-partner. As with unmarried women, there has been limited empirical research on men's unmet need for family planning (forexamples, see Dodoo, Luo, and Panayotova 1997; Ngom 1997). A related topic research is \"couple unmet need\" (Bankole and Ezeh 1997; Becker 1999). Given that fertility preferences are a property of indi-viduals rather than couples, couple unmet need does not seem a useful con- cept, unless its formulation explicitly recognizes the possibility of spousal discordance in fertility preferences. The comparison between preferencesand behavior that lies at the heart of unmet need makes no sense for dyads in which one partner can have preferences that differ from the other partner's. This is another instance of the irresolvable nature of what de-mographers usually term the \"two-sex problem.\" There are many relevant topics to investigate without resorting to the concept of \"couple unmet need\": sex differences in levels of unmet need, the extent to which the attainmentof one partner's preferences is incompatible with the attainment of the other partner's preferences, and the influence of each partner on the contracep- tive attitudes and behaviors of the other (e.g., Ezeh 1993). A final respect in which the conventional approach to unmet need has been criticized as being too narrow is the neglect of contraceptive users who are dissatisfied with their method or by some other criteria are usingan inappropriate method (Dixon-Mueller and Germain 1992; Foreit and Mostajo 1993). One simple rule is to exclude less efficacious contraceptive methods\u2014certain of the so-called traditional methods, for example\u2014fromthe definition of contraceptive use, rendering women using these methods eligible for inclusion in the unmet need category. In Vietnam, applying this rule to recent survey data results in an increase in the percentage of cur-rently married women with unmet need from 14 percent to 36 percent (Phai et al. 1996). In considering whether such refinements of the definition of unmet need are desirable, we return to the overarching goal that motivatesthe concept, namely the avoidance of unintended pregnancies (Yinger 1998). Contraception that provides inadequate protection from pregnancy\u2014either because of features intrinsic to the method or because users are dissatisfied708 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsand therefore use the method incorrectly\u2014does not meet this goal, and by leaving users at risk of an unintended pregnancy does not completely re- move them from the state of unmet need for family planning. In our view, therefore, classifying some users as having unmet need is in principle con-sistent with the basic concept of unmet need as it has been understood over the years. Conceptual issues remain to be resolved, particularly whether unmet need should be viewed not as a dichotomy but as a continuum, withsome individuals having a greater degree of unmet need (or, better, a greater risk of an unwanted pregnancy) than others (El-Zeini forthcoming). 17 There are also measurement challenges: for example, how can use-effectivenessand method dissatisfaction be ascertained in a DHS-type survey? Unmet need and programmatic action From the 1960s to the present, survey estimates of widespread prevalenceof unmet need (or its predecessor \"KAP-gap\") have been used to justifypublic and private investment in programs to provide family planning ser- vices to women and men, presuming that unmet need can be successfully addressed through programmatic interventions. Whether or not it can de-pends, first, on the nature and strength of the obstacles to the implementa- tion of fertility preferences and, second, on the degree to which those obstacles can be weakened or even eliminated through programmatic interventions.Hence, in considering the role of unmet need in justifying and informing the design of programs, we begin with a review of evidence on the causes of unmet need. We can point to nine in-depth studies conducted in the 1990s that entailed primary data collection (mixing qualitative and quantitative ap- proaches), 18 complemented by several DHS analyses that in effect examine the same problem (Bongaarts and Bruce 1995; Westoff and Bankole 1995). This surge in research on the causes of unmet need can be attributed to an awareness of a significant void in the empirical literature, combined with arenewed commitment by donors (including the Rockefeller Foundation, the US Agency for International Development, and the Hewlett Foundation) to advancing scientific knowledge on this problem. This research investmentis indicative of a recognition on the part of these donors that a better un- derstanding of individuals' reproductive aspirations and the barriers to re- alizing those aspirations is a prerequisite if policies and programs are to berefashioned in a manner that is responsive to the Cairo agenda. For the purpose of informing the design of programmatic interventions to reduce unmet need, the basic question is to what extent nonuse can beattributed to the properties of contraceptive methods or of family planning ser- vices, as against entrenched social and cultural barriers. 19 If, for example, the primary reason that women do not act on their desire to limit fertility is theJOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 709 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsopposition of husbands, other kin, and/or influential members of the com- munity, then programs must develop strategies for reducing these social barriers. Or perhaps the sensible conclusion is that there is little that family planning programs can do to overcome such barriers, in which case therationale for investment in such programs is seriously undermined. If, on the other hand, the primary reason for nonuse is a fear of side effects or other issues related to the service delivery environment, presumably infor-mational and organizational reforms can be undertaken in response. The usual conclusion that emerges from recent empirical research is that inadequate access to services is not one of the predominant causes of unmetneed. 20 This finding is consistent with evidence in DHS surveys (Bongaarts and Bruce 1995; Westoff and Bankole 1995). It would be a mistake to infer from this finding that problems related to access have been eliminated. Wom-en and men in rural Pakistan, for example, identify the remoteness of fam- ily planning services as one of the main barriers to contraceptive use (Popu- lation Council/Islamabad 1997). But in general, inadequate access to services is less often cited as a reason for unmet need than other costs of contraceptive use, most notably social opposition and health concerns, as discussed below. In evaluating this finding, two points must be kept in mind. First, by design none of the in-depth studies of reasons for unmet need reviewed here permits a rigorous assessment of the contribution of the accessibility of services, as might be achieved, for example, through a quasi-experimen-tal design (pre-test, intervention, post-test) or even a sample design strati- fied on access to services. While women rarely cite lack of access as a pri- mary reason for not using contraceptives, a properly designed comparisonof women with adequate and inadequate access might reveal substantial differences in the prevalence of unmet need. Well-designed quasi-experi- mental studies in several settings demonstrate that improved access can havelarge effects on contraceptive prevalence (for Bangladesh, see Koenig et al. 1992 and Cleland et al. 1994; for northern Ghana, see Debpuur et al. forth- coming). A second and more fundamental point about the role of the fam-ily planning service environment is that many of the nonaccess barriers to use identified below can be attacked through appropriately designed pro- grammatic initiatives (Bongaarts and Bruce 1995). Of the causes of unmet need other than those related to access to serv- ices, three emerge from the in-depth studies as especially salient: lack of necessary knowledge about contraceptive methods, social opposition to theiruse, and health concerns about possible side effects. On the matter of knowledge, there are many potential informational barriers to contraceptive use. Women must be aware of contraceptive meth-ods, they must know where supplies of these methods can be obtained and how much they cost (with the exception of methods such as withdrawal and rhythm), and they must know how to properly use the method they710 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsselect. There are few settings in which most women possess all the neces- sary information. Indeed, in sub-Saharan Africa substantial fractions of women are simply not aware of any modern methods of contraception (Westoff and Bankole 1995). Elsewhere, many are aware of only one ortwo rather than the full range of available methods. Incomplete or errone- ous information about where to obtain methods and how to use them may be even more prevalent (Robey, Ross, and Bhushan 1996). These types ofinformation problems related to contraception are strongly associated with unmet need in cross-national analyses (Bongaarts and Bruce 1995) and in more-localized studies in Pakistan (Population Council/Islamabad 1997) andnorthern India (Viswanathan, Godfrey, and Yinger 1998; Mishra et al. 1999). The second and third causes\u2014social opposition and health concerns\u2014are but the two most salient \"costs of contraception,\" to use the terminology of theEasterlin synthesis framework (Easterlin 1975; Hermalin 1983). Contraceptive costs are broadly defined to include social, cultural, psychic, and economic costs of adopting and continuing to use a method. While these costs have been rec-ognized for some time (Bogue 1983; Nag 1984), only during the 1990s was their nature and strength investigated in a variety of settings. The recent in-depth studies have focused on unmet need among women, and, not surprisingly, opposition on the part of the husband\u2014real or perceived\u2014has drawn the most attention. The woman's husband is one of many socially significant actors who might discourage or oppose a womanwho wishes to use contraception, but clearly in most settings the husband is by far the most dominant influence. The husband's opposition is identi- fied as a major reason for nonuse in studies conducted in the Philippines(Casterline, Perez, and Biddlecom 1997), Guatemala (Asturias de Barrios 1998), India (Viswanathan, Godfrey, and Yinger 1998; Mishra et al. 1999), Egypt (El-Zanaty et al. 1999), Nepal (Stash 1999), and Pakistan (Casterline,Sathar, and Haque forthcoming). Other persons who are often portrayed as hindrances to contraceptive use are parents-in-law (especially mothers-in- law) and other in-laws, neighbors, and local community leaders (politicalor religious). A conclusion that emerges from these and other studies is that unmet need is as much a reflection of primary social relations as it is of individualattitudes and experiences. This \"social component\" takes different forms depending upon the setting. In Pakistan, most women are convinced that their husbands oppose most methods of family planning, and contraceptivepractice without the husband's approval is unthinkable. Their husbands, in turn, are concerned about the social acceptability of contraception in their social circle of extended kin and community members (Population Coun-cil/Islamabad 1997). In this sense, the husband becomes the conduit through which other actors influence women's contraceptive decisions. In northern Ghana, most women with unmet need and their husbands are unsure aboutJOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 711 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentswhether their spouses, relatives, and friends approve of contraceptive use, and this uncertainty makes them hesitant to adopt a radically new technol- ogy. Women's denial of the use of contraception is common (Biddlecom, Tagoe-Darko, and Adazu 1998). Recent empirical studies have revealed the processes through which spousal relations create barriers to using contraception. According to data from several settings, wives and husbands on balance concur in their fertil-ity preferences and in their views about contraception (e.g., Biddlecom, Cast- erline, and Perez 1997; Mason and Smith 2000). How is it, then, that hus- bands represent barriers to their wives' use of contraception? The answer istwofold. First, wives frequently misperceive their husbands' attitudes. This is of some consequence because attitudes toward contraception are under- going change, and spouses' mutual misperceptions seem to be repositoriesfor outdated (and often inaccurately negative) views (Population Council/ Islamabad 1997). Second, while only a minority of husbands are more strongly opposed to contraception than their wives, in these instances thehusband's view typically wins out. The wives of this minority of husbands appear to account for a disproportionate share of women with unmet need (Biddlecom, Casterline, and Perez 1997). Another widespread finding is that health concerns are a major ob- stacle to the adoption and continued use of contraception. (See Bongaarts and Bruce 1995; Casterline, al. 1999; Stash 1999.) Health concerns have been cited for dec- ades by family planning fieldworkers. Recent empirical research providesmore-rigorous confirmation of the powerful influence health concerns ex- ercise over contraceptive decisionmaking. From qualitative interviews con- ducted in diverse settings, it is clear that health concerns are strongly feltand are not simply a convenient excuse on the part of the women. Recent qualitative research also shows that health concerns are multidimensional, a fact often overlooked by researchers and even family planning programmanagers. Interviews in Egypt, Nepal, Pakistan, and Zambia reveal that fear of the health side effects of contraceptives dissuades women from using a method, not only because of aversion to the expected physical discomfort(and worse) but also because of the expected time and financial costs of managing the side effects, the potential loss of labor productivity, the possi- bility of interference with spousal sexual relations, and a sense that the sideeffects signify divine disapproval. Once the multidimensional nature of this cost of contraception is recognized, it becomes clear why health concerns present an imposing barrier to use. From the standpoint of the design of effective programs, what are we to make of these findings about the causes of unmet need? There is little solid evidence about what specific tactics programs can employ to reduce712 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsobstacles to contraception that result from social opposition and health con- cerns (so-called nonaccess barriers). In certain settings increased density of services and improvements in the quality of services are followed by sub- stantial increases in contraceptive use, and much of this increase is the re-sult of greater use among already-motivated women, that is, satisfaction of unmet need (on Bangladesh, see Koenig et al. 1992 and Cleland et al. 1994; for northern Ghana, see Debpuur et al. forthcoming). If access to serviceshas the same low ranking among the causes of unmet need in these set- tings as in the research just reviewed, then it follows that the program im- pact observed in these experimental studies must be due in large part to thereduction or elimination of nonaccess barriers to use. These nonaccess ef- fects of programs have long been recognized (Cleland and Wilson 1987; Phillips and Ross 1992; Cleland 1994) but to date have not been carefullymeasured. We need experimental research in which both the pre-test and the post-test incorporate a rigorous assessment of the causes of unmet need, of the sort carried out in the in-depth studies cited above, from which itwould be possible to determine the extent to which the intervention af- fected each of the causes. It is nevertheless clear that programs can be deliberately designed to attack nonaccess barriers. Consider health concerns about contraceptive use. A number of well-recognized programmatic strategies are available for over- coming health concerns that block the adoption and continued use of con-traception. These include careful counseling of women about likely side ef- fects at the time contraceptive supplies are obtained, periodic follow-up of adopters in which special attention is given to health side effects, and localavailability of a range of methods so that, when necessary, women can switch methods. Some of these strategies, in turn, depend on sound training of fieldworkers and the development of effective educational material. And,as noted above, health services that are more attentive to women's broader reproductive needs are likely to be more responsive to women's health con- cerns about contraception. Unmet need and population policy A persistent mistake during the past three decades has been to equate popu- lation policy with the singular aim of improving family planning services (i.e., through family planning programs) (Jain and Bruce 1994). There areof course important population issues worthy of concern other than high fertility. And fertility levels are certainly influenced by a host of social, cul- tural, and economic factors, as recognized at both the 1974 World Popula-tion Conference at Bucharest and the International Conference on Popula- tion at Mexico City in 1984 (United Nations 1974 and 1984). Despite this, many countries have pursued population policies virtually as if family plan-JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 713 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsning were the only thing that mattered. While most countries have articu- lated policies that acknowledge the importance of increasing female school- ing, reducing infant and child mortality, and empowering women, in most cases the population policies that were implemented consisted of little morethan the mounting of family planning programs. Only in the period since the International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo in 1994 has a deeper appreciation developed of the importance of these otherpolicy goals, both as indirect measures to reduce fertility and as desirable population policy aims in their own right (for an overview see Ashford and Makinson 1999). It has been argued, as we said above, that a focus on the prevention of unintended pregnancies maintains the emphasis in population policy on family planning programs and that, as a result, the broader social policyreforms called for at Cairo will continue to be neglected. Some even fear that governments might reinstate unethical and coercive approaches to fam- ily planning. 21 In our view, however, this line of argument ignores the dis- tinctive features of the unmet need concept. In joining contraceptive be- havior and fertility preferences, the unmet need concept also joins family planning and broader development approaches to population policy. This isso for two reasons. First, if policymakers accept the challenge of reducing unmet need, then they are forced to confront the causes of unmet need. The accumulating research, reviewed above, shows that social and culturalobstacles figure more prominently than simple access to services as causes of unmet need. By forcing policymakers and program managers to confront the question of why apparent demand is not expressed in contraceptive prac-tice, unmet need can encourage a more-balanced assessment of the full range of obstacles, ignoring neither access to services nor the nonaccess factors (Bongaarts and Bruce 1995). The second and more general means through which unmet need links family planning to broader development approaches is by keeping fertility pref- erences squarely in the picture. In so doing, it has the further virtue of retain-ing in the policy discourse the basic issue of individual versus collective goals (Demeny 1986). If unmet need were to be discarded as a guiding concept, the field might revert to almost exclusive reliance on the contraceptive prevalencerate and the total fertility rate as the key measures of success, irrespective of individual childbearing goals. Far better, if a broad view of population policy is to be sustained, is the fundamental distinction between the prevalence of non-use among those who want to avoid pregnancy and the prevalence of a desire to avoid pregnancy. An equivalent distinction is central to Bongaarts's decom- position of future population growth, in which unwanted fertility and wantedfertility are separable components of total fertility rather than being regarded as alternative sources of high fertility (Bongaarts 1994). Fertility reduction through the prevention of unintended pregnancies follows from the satisfac-714 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentstion of individual goals, whereas any further decline deemed in the collective interest must come about either through transformation of individual child- bearing aspirations or through various coercive means, the latter deemed un- acceptable in most societies. There is then considerable value in maintainingthese distinctions, which the concept of unmet need brings to the fore. Popula- tion policies are not in principle compelled to choose one or the other (reduc- tion in unmet need or in fertility desires). Rather they can and should addressboth components. 22 One further justification for retaining unmet need as a cornerstone of population policy has already been touched on but bears reemphasizing. Inmaking the reduction of unmet need a primary goal, population policies are insisting that helping individuals achieve their personal aspirations is a primary objective of public policy. Indeed, we argue that this is the mostwidely accepted rationale for the establishment of public policy (Sinding, Ross, and Rosenfield 1994; United Nations 1994). This contention does not address the more difficult question of which public policies are defensiblewhen the fulfillment of individual aspirations appears to run counter to col- lective interests (Demeny 1986; Lee 1990; MacKellar 1997). In considering population policies at the beginning of the twenty-first century, most de-veloping countries have the luxury of not having to grapple head on with this question, because in nearly all of them the elimination of unmet need would produce fertility outcomes that are consistent with generally agreeddefinitions of the public good. In more practical terms, unmet need results in unwanted pregnancies, which in turn more often than not lead to unwanted births, because inmost societies a large proportion of unwanted pregnancies are carried to term. Unwanted fertility remains a more substantial problem than is ac- knowledged by political leaders in many developing countries and by do-nor agencies around the world. As noted above, roughly one-fifth to one- quarter of births in the developing world are unwanted, with the number of pregnancies that are unwanted even higher. The impression persists inmany capitals that family planning should be placed well down the list of priorities for publicly provided services because demand for such services is low and because, in any case, investments that will stimulate demand forsmaller families must come first. This impression harks back to the time, before the extensive series of surveys that began with the WFS, when many social scientists assumed that large families were desired and were skepticalabout the extent of unsatisfied demand for fertility regulation. That many of these attitudes persist indicates how wide the gap can remain between new evidence and the premises that guide policymakers. Indeed, most of thecurrent generation of senior policy officials were students two or three decades ago and maintain an outdated view of fertility in developing countries. Beyond the question of whether and how much attention should be given to unmet need for family planning in designing population policies,JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 715 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthere are two concrete programmatic issues concerning unmet need. The first is, what accounts for unmet need? We argued earlier that a balanced understanding of the causes of unmet need is a prerequisite for developing effective programs to reduce it, and for this reason we advocate an institu-tionalization of local social science research on this topic. The temptation among program managers and policymakers is to perceive family planning programs as primarily a matter of improving access to services. In-depthresearch on reasons for nonuse can be a powerful antidote to this narrow- minded view of what programs can accomplish. This should not be a one- time undertaking: as fertility transition proceeds in each country, the rela-tive dominance of the various obstacles to contraceptive use can be expected to shift. A second issue is, how feasible is it for programs to target their efforts at individuals (women and men) with unmet need? While recom-mending such an approach would appear to follow naturally from the ar- guments in this article, in fact designing programs in this fashion is not likely to prove practical or cost-efficient, for two reasons. First, individuals moverapidly in and out of the unmet need state (Ross 1994; Robey, making the unmet need subgroup a moving target(El-Zeini forthcoming). Second, it is asking a great deal of health and fam- ily planning workers to monitor individuals' fertility preferences. 23 Rather than attempting to pinpoint women and men with unmet need, the more-effective programmatic strategy is to be well informed about the societal- specific causes of unmet need and, accordingly, develop interventions to overcome those obstacles. Notes This research was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the Hewlett Foundation. Comments on earlier drafts by John Bongaarts, Laila El-Zeini, Ronald Freedman, James McCarthy, and Charles Westoff are gratefully acknowledged. 1 Most of these in-depth studies were con- ducted under two multi-country projects on unmet need: one based at the Population Council, directed by John Casterline and funded primarily by the Rockefeller Founda- tion (studies in Ghana, Pakistan, and Zambia); and a second project based at the International Center for Research on Women, directed by Nancy Yinger and funded by USAID (studies in Guatemala, India, and Zambia). Among the more rigorous studies cited in this article that were outside the scope of those two projects are: Casterline, Perez, and Biddlecom (1997)in the Philippines; (1999) in Egypt; Jain (1999) in Peru; and Stash (1999) in Nepal. 2 The 1980 WFS Conference in London included in its program a paper by Palmore and Concepci\u00f3n on the relationship between fer- tility desires and contraceptive practice (Palmore and Concepci\u00f3n 1981). Moreover, several of the numerous analyses of WFS data were directed at this relationship, for example Ochoa (1982); Pullum, Immerwahr, and Cabigon (1984); and Johnson-Acs\u00e1di and Szykman 3 See also Brackett (1978). Apparently the term \"unmet need for family planning\" origi- nates with Stokes (1977). 4 The notion that achievement of indi- viduals' reproductive aspirations would also716 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentslargely satisfy societal goals hardly originated with the preparations for the ICPD, although it received renewed emphasis during this pe- riod. One precursor, usually neglected in in- ternational population discussions, is the work of the US Commission on Population and the American Future; see Westoff (1973). 5 As one quantitative indicator of this judgment, El-Zeini (forthcoming) shows that the number of documents in the population literature with \"unmet need\" in the title or ab- stract surged in the two years leading up to the Cairo conference, and fell off in the suc- ceeding years. 6 Even Pritchett (1994), one of the most outspoken critics of the concept of unmet need, acknowledges the validity of survey data on fertility desires. 7 In the studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (Mushingeh and Kurz 1998); com and Kaona 1998), however, a far lower fraction of the women and men classified as having unmet need expressed frustration with their inability to practice contraception or other deliberate means of fertility regulation. In this region, self-perception of unmet need appears to be rarer than elsewhere, despite comparable (or higher) survey estimates of the prevalence of unmet need. 8 A few empirical studies by social psy- chologists have examined the consistency be- tween fertility preferences and contraceptive behavior. See, for example, Jaccard et al. (1990). 9 These findings are reviewed at greater length below. 10 In addition to the argument described here, Pritchett questions the validity of the con- cept on other grounds, citing entirely differ- ent types of evidence. We consider these lines of attack in other sections of this article. 11 An equivalent exercise is carried out by Bongaarts (1993), who decomposes fertil- ity decline during the 1980s in 12 developing countries. He calculates that increased imple- mentation of preferences accounted for 66 per- cent of the observed fertility decline on aver- age. Several other single-country studies demonstrate that changes in factors associated with the demand for children\u2014such as school-ing, structure of the economy, and child sur- vival\u2014appear to account for most of the ob- served change in contraceptive use and/or fer- tility: for Indonesia in the 1980s, see Gertler and Molyneaux (1994); for Iran from the 1950s to the 1970s, see Raftery, Lewis, and Aghajanian (1995). However, these same fac- tors can also influence the implementation of preferences, thus these studies do not speak directly to the question of how much of the fertility change can be attributed solely to changes in fertility desires. In a study of Prussia in the late nineteenth century, Lee, Galloway, and Hammel (1994) conclude that while re- ductions in the demand for children account for the largest part of the fertility decline, \"readiness to contracept\" also makes a substan- tial contribution (accounting for one-sixth to one-third of the decline, under various speci- fications). In a less formal, more interpretative analysis of the countries of South Asia, Shah and Cleland (1993) argue that considerable un- satisfied demand for fertility regulation exists in these societies, and hence in the short term substantial fertility decline could occur with little or no change in fertility desires. 12 In a personal communication to the au- thors, Ronald Freedman calls Matlab \"a major landmark,\" undertaken in a setting deemed to be highly unfavorable to fertility decline, be- cause its proponents had ascertained through survey research that there was substantial \"la- tent demand.\" Freedman writes: \"In the course of the experiment it was established: (1) that there was unmet need; (2) that their efforts did not decrease desired fertility compared to controls; (3) that the program designed...was shown to be able to overcome...several kinds of barriers...; [and] (4) that it crystallized la- tent demand; that is, it changed the situation from latent demand with little use of contra- ception to an increasing contraceptive use and fertility decline.\" We have more to say below on Matlab and the Bangladesh experience. 13 In a similar vein, alternative algorithms for estimating unmet need based on the in- tention to use contraception run the risk of being untrue to the underlying concept (Becker 1999). Becker's definition restricts un- met need to those nonusers who want to avoid pregnancy and who intend to use contracep- tion within 12 months. He excludes those who want to avoid pregnancy but do not intend toJOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W. S INDING 717 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsuse contraceptives, a radical departure from the usual concept of unmet need (which, surpris- ingly, Becker does not justify as an effort to tie unmet need more closely to the demand for family planning). Interestingly, Westoff (forthcoming) has also proposed an alterna- tive algorithm for unmet need that depends on the intention to use. In contrast to Becker, and more consistent with the usual concept of unmet need, Westoff classifies as having unmet need those women not intending to use contraceptives despite a desire to avoid preg- nancy (other conditions must be met as well), whereas most women intending to use are ex- cluded from his unmet need category, under the assumption (confirmed by many empiri- cal studies) that they are likely to carry through with this intention. One of Westoff's aims in proposing a new algorithm is to achieve a bet- ter fit between unmet need and the demand for family planning. 14 The tabulations of DHS data in Ross, Stover, and Willard (1999) demonstrate, how- ever, that these quantities are typically nearly the same at the national level, because the number of non-intenders among those womenwith unmet need roughly equals the number of intenders among those without unmet need. 15 In this judgment we concur with West- off (forthcoming). One could, at the cost of greater complexity of language, refer to \"pref- erence-based unmet need for family planning,\" \"health-risk-based unmet need for family plan- ning,\" and so forth. 16 Exceptions are Biddlecom and Kaona (1998) and the ICRW studies in Guatemala and Zambia (Asturias de Barrios et al. 1998; Mushingeh and Kurz 1998). 17 How to treat less effective methods is admittedly a complex question. Many couples are, in fact, highly successful in avoiding preg- nancy through use of methods classified as less effective by medical criteria, because they are highly motivated to avoid becoming pregnant and are concerned about the health side ef- fects of the more effective methods. This can be the case with withdrawal, for example. Fur- ther, where safe and reliable induced abortion is available as a backup, users of less effective methods are at greater risk of unintended preg- nancies but possibly not unintended births, an important distinction that we discuss elsewherein the article. Rarely, however, is safe abor- tion readily available and inexpensive, and hence it is an empirical regularity that users of less effective methods experience higher rates of both unintended pregnancy and unintended births as compared to users of modern effec- tive methods. 18 These nine are Casterline, Perez, and Biddlecom (1997) for for Zambia; El Zanaty et al. (1999) for Egypt; Stash (1999) for Nepal; and three studies conducted under the ICRW project (Yinger 1998) for Gua- temala, India, and Zambia. 19 This section draws on the review of empirical research presented in United Nations (1999). 20 By no means is there unanimity on this point. See, for example, Ross's (1995) critique of Bongaarts and Bruce (1995). In the case of Pakistan, Shelton et al. (1999) have made the case, through an analysis of the impact of the expansion of family planning services in cer- tain communities, that lack of access to serv- ices is a major reason for unmet need in that country. 21 Few of these criticisms have been pub- lished in recent years, although Hartmann and Sen contributed op-ed articles along these lines at the time of the \"Cairo+5\" meetings at the Hague and at the UN in New York in Febru- ary and June 1999, respectively. Nonetheless, in numerous meetings and symposia in the post-Cairo years, these concerns have surfaced frequently. 22 A further strategy for fertility reduction is increased induced abortion. As has been stressed throughout this article, contraception is a means for preventing unintended pregnan- cies, thereby also preventing unintended births. Induced abortion is an alternative means for avoiding unintended births and must enter into policy deliberations, if for no other rea- son than the fact that a large fraction of preg- nancies are terminated by induced abortion, both safe and unsafe, legal and illegal (Alan Guttmacher Institute 1999). In some settings where it is acceptable on legal and moral grounds, induced abortion is the primary di- rect means of birth control (e.g., Eastern Eu-718 UNMET NEED FOR FAMILY PLANNING Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsReferences Adler, Nancy E., Susan M.

On medical grounds there are many reasons for preferring contraception to induced abortion, and there is considerable evidence that this medical judgment conforms with women's own preferences. However, it is equally clear that in many circumstances women will opt for induced abortion rather than bear an unwanted child. The availability of safe abortion for unwanted pregnancies, whether the result of contraceptive failure or nonuse of contraception, remains a crucial is- sue in reproductive health policy.23 But see Jain (1999) for practical sug- gestions along these lines. Ross (1994) and Robey, Ross, and Bhushan (1996) note that although individuals move in and out of the unmet need state, the demographic and socio- economic characteristics of persons with un- met need may be rather stable. This provides some basis for targeting, once research has es- tablished the dominant characteristics of per- sons with unmet need in a particular setting.JOHN B. C ASTERLINE / S TEVEN W.

Their alarm was followed by the growth in power and reach of an international population movement: an alliance of neo-Malthusians and birth controllers who attempted to alter sig-nificantly the reproductive behavior of millions of developing-world couples. The era ended, symbolically at least, with the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in 1994, which demoted popu-lation goals below those of attaining gender equity and improving the re- productive health of women in poor countries (Hodgson and Watkins 1997). By now most developing-world governments have adopted neo- Malthusian population policies, and they promote and distribute modern methods of family planning; many individuals in these countries say they themselves are, or would be, better off with fewer rather than more chil-dren; and many women are using modern methods of family planning to limit their family size (Bongaarts and Watkins 1996). As a consequence of small-family preferences and the use of contraception, fertility has declined,or has begun to decline, in most developing countries. Most writers who have attempted to summarize this era have taken a comprehensive approach. This article differs in its focus on a small geographi-cal area, in its privileging of cultural models of reproduction rather than individual behavior, and in its historical dimension. The focus is local be- cause I view widespread transformation in cultural models of reproductionas the aggregation of a multitude of changes in local communities. I will show, however, that local communities are profoundly influenced by pow- erful outside actors who change local circumstances, thus provoking localnetworks to reevaluate cultural models. I reach back to the colonial period because fundamental changes in perceptions about the best model of re- production occurred then.726 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThe local area is South Nyanza District,1 Nyanza Province, Kenya, an area on the shores of Lake Victoria that is predominantly inhabited by Luos. During the six decades between the mid-1930s and the mid-1990s, the lo- cal consideration of alternative cultural models was driven by uncertaintyabout the goals of reproduction and the best strategies through which to achieve them. When representatives of the international population move- ment arrived in Kenya in the early 1960s with their own cultural model ofreproduction, it seemed obvious to them that the country would be better off with lower fertility and that Kenyan families would be wealthier if they were smaller and thus if they used family planning to limit the number oftheir children. In rural Kenya, the route to riches was not so obvious. An example illustrates the problem of uncertainty. In the 1974 televi- sion documentary Maragoli , set in an area of Western Province near South Nyanza, a chief and his wife radiate satisfaction as they tell Joseph Ssessen- yonga, the interviewer, about the education that each of their many chil- dren achieved or married into, and display the gifts of money and clothingthat their well-off children sent to them. No doubt, the same stories and gifts were known to their friends, relatives, and neighbors. But which parts of the model of reproduction that the chief displayed should be followed bya poor villager\u2014the part that showed that many children are the way to wealth or the evidence that it is costly education that mat ters? Although uncertainty is masked in most sources of data, our interviews, conducted be-tween 1994 and 2000 as contraceptive use was rising rapidly, showed contin- ued uncertainty about the best model of reproduction. As late as the mid-1980s, Kenya appeared to some as an unlikely set- ting for a rapid reproductive transformation (Frank and McNicoll 1987; Mott and Mott 1980). In Nyanza, many of the practices considered by these and other analysts to be \"cultural barriers\" to fertility change were in place inthe 1970s and the 1980s, such as polygyny, communal landholding that did not disadvantage larger families, a highly stratified gender system, and ethnic competition (e.g., Ndisi 1974; Ocholla-Ayayo 1976; Suda 1991). Theseinstitutions are still present, and ethnic competition is, if anything, greater. 2 Nevertheless, the 1989 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS-I)showed that fertility had declined in Nyanza as well as nationally (Cross,Obunga, and Kizito 1991; Kenya, Republic of 1994), and Warren Robinson (1992) proclaimed that Kenya had entered the fertility transition. 3 The on- set of fertility decline appeared to have been quite abrupt. It appears much lessabrupt, however, if we ask about models of reproduction rather than behavior. I show that there were three distinct but temporally overlapping cul- tural models of reproduction between 1930 and the present. The first modelviews many children as the way to wealth. This \"large families are rich\" model was probably well established when Kenya became a British colony in 1920. Its dominance, however, came to be undermined as Kenya wasSUSAN COTTS WATKINS 727 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsincreasingly integrated into the imperial polity and economy. The changed circumstances consequent on British rule provoked the collective formula- tion of a second model, \"small families are progressive.\" This competing model, available for consideration around the time of Independence in 1963,retained the same goal of wealth but viewed a smaller family as a better strat- egy for achieving the progress that development was expected to bring in the new Kenya. Strikingly, however, even those who perceived small families tobe advantaged considered the deliberate control of fertility illicit. The third model augments the local \"small families are progressive\" model by including the de- liberate control of fertility using clinic-based methods of family planning. Both the \"large families are rich\" and the \"small families are progres- sive\" models were collectively formulated in response to local circumstances. The third model, however, was promoted first by the global networks ofthe international population movement and then by the Kenyan govern- ment itself. Initially, Kenyans perceived this new model as the model of the wazungu . Wazungu (plural) is a Kiswahili word for those who are both white and foreign and has connotations that suggest the wazungu were perceived ambivalently: a muzungu (singular) is: \"1) something wonderful, strange, startling or tricky; 2) a cunning person; 3) a gentleman; 4) knowledge orskill\" (The Watchman 1996). I describe below the domestication of the wazungu model of reproduction, as rural clinics began to routinely promote family planning and men and women in the villages of Nyanza started us-ing family planning and told others of their motivations and experiences, thus creating a local Luo model. Data This article uses archival records, surveys in the 1960s, a systematic review of the Nairobi press in the 1970s and 1980s, secondary literature, and quali- tative and quantitative interviews conducted in four sublocations in rural South Nyanza District between 1994 and 2000. The aim of the data collec-tion in the 1990s was to examine the role of social networks in reproduc- tive health, including family planning and AIDS. A brief description of the data collection procedures follows; a detailed description is available atwww.pop.upenn.edu/networks. The district had a population of 1,066,583 in the 1989 census (Kenya, Republic of 1996: 2), most of whom are Luos engaged in subsistence agri-culture supplemented by cash crops, some wage labor and petty trade, as well as remittances from family members working in cities. The four sublocations were chosen to maximize variety in the extent of interactionwith areas outside South Nyanza and according to the presence or absence of a community-based distribution program in which family planning meth- ods were distributed by local volunteers. All interviews were conducted in728 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthe local language, Luo. The personnel of the research team remained largely the same over all phases of the research, and consisted of principal investi- gators assisted by graduate students from the University of Pennsylvania, five Luo supervisors who were graduates of the University of Nairobi, dataentry personnel, and, for the household surveys, interviewer teams of ap- proximately 20 local high school graduates from each sublocation. The first set of qualitative interviews was conducted in 1994. Using a semistructured interview guide, the supervisors interviewed 40 married women of reproductive age and 40 men (the men were the women's hus- bands if the husbands were resident, although many were working else-where) and they conducted nine focus group discussions with women of reproductive age. The respondents for the semistructured interviews were selected systematically to ensure an even distribution around the main lo-cations of social interaction (e.g., the village centers). Although we attempted to select focus group participants systematically, in the event the chiefs in- fluenced their selection, and the participants were disproportionately womenwith higher levels of primary education or some secondary education, and disproportionately ever-users of family planning methods. The interviews were taped and then transcribed and translated into English by the supervi-sors; the audio quality was not sufficient to identify speakers. The supervi- sors were all fluent in English, and were asked to retain the colloquial speech forms of the respondents. The transcripts were typed and reviewed in thefield, which permitted clarifications. A subsample of the tapes were tran- scribed and translated independently to check for consistency. The tran- scripts of the interviews and focus groups were coded by the principal in-vestigators (Watkins and Rutenberg); they were also coded independently by two students who had not been involved in the data collection. In 1996- 97 the same supervisors conducted semistructured interviews and focusgroups with elderly women and men: seven men, eight women, and three focus groups. The elderly respondents were not selected systematically, but most were parents of the respondents in our household sample. Again, theinterviews were taped, transcribed, and translated. In addition, some inter- views were done on an ad hoc basis by the supervisors and by the principal investigators with a translator present. The household survey was longitudinal. The first wave was conducted in December 1994-January 1995, with re-interviews of the same respon- dents conducted at about the same time of year in 1996-97 and again inJanuary-February 2000. Villages were randomly selected in each sublocation; within each selected village, all women of reproductive age and their hus- bands who were currently present were interviewed (for an evaluation ofsample attrition, see Alderman et al. 2000). The sample characteristics closely match those for rural Nyanza Province interviewed in the 1993 Kenya De- mographic and Health Survey (Reynar 2000). The questionnaires wereSUSAN COTTS WATKINS 729 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentschecked daily by the supervisors and by Watkins and graduate students, and were immediately made machine-readable, thus providing several lay- ers of checks for data quality (for evaluations of several aspects of data qual- ity, see Weinreb 2000; Reynar 2000; and White and Watkins forthcoming). I follow a chronological order, discussing the models in each period and, for the first two models, how they were undermined and augmented by an alternative model. In the first section on the colonial period, I showthat the justifications for small families now offered by young Luo couples are not new: they could also have justified small families in the colonial period. In the second section, I use surveys conducted in the mid-1960s toshow that an indigenous small-family model was under consideration shortly after Independence, and then turn to the introduction of the wazungu model by the international population movement and its domestication amongurban elites. The third section draws on surveys and semistructured inter- views conducted in Nyanza in the 1990s to show how Luos are now evalu- ating models of reproduction in their social networks. In the last section, Idiscuss the relevance of this examination of a particular local area for theo- ries of fertility transition as well as for other international efforts to alter reproductive behavior. The relation of children to wealth in the colonial period Perceptions that large families are rich In semistructured interviews with elderly men and women in Nyanza, we asked why people in the past had so many children. A conversation withan elderly man, his wife, and his sister-in-law was typical of others. The patriarch explained: \"If you had many children wealth could come in great numbers in your home.\" Children brought social esteem\u2014\"you were some-one in the community\"\u2014but he emphasized the material wealth they were expected to bring. Children were the route to riches: \"If you had all sons and worked hard you'd be wealthy.\" We asked: \"If you had five boys and few girls, would you still want girls to get more wealth?\" \"Yes,\" answered his wife, \"you would pray hard for girls to get wealth. If you gave birth to girls you knewyou were wealthy already.\" The sister-in-law added, \"In the old days you got 15 or 20 cows in bride price for the girls, and that way the boys could marry. In the old days it was only through these cows that you could getwealth\" (interview, 1996). The elderly are well aware that younger married couples in their vil- lage are discussing the advisability of using modern family planning to limitthe number of their children. They are also well aware that the Govern-730 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsment of Kenya and wazungu promote smaller families and family planning, and perceived our research team as associated with these national and in- ternational efforts. As if to counter the program's neo-Malthusian posters depicting large families as hungry and poor, the elderly insisted that mate-rial conditions were not constrained during their childhood. Land and cows were abundant, and there was much food. When their children complained about the high costs of things that must be paid for with money, the elderlyresponded by saying that in their youth there was no need for money. They did not go to school; they never got sick or, if they did, they were cured by traditional medicine, paid for with a chicken; they used flour to powdertheir babies rather than the store-bought baby powder that their daugh- ters-in-law prefer. The elderly emphasized that in the old days people never complained about many children, that family planning is new and that it comesfrom outside Nyanza, as in this focus group of elderly women in one of our research sites, an island in Lake Victoria (female focus group participants, 1995): Moderator: In the past, how many children could people have? Response 1: You would just give birth. Response 2: You could just give birth to as many as you could, even if they were 10. Response 3: Even 12 or 15 or 20, those are your children. Response 4: Yes, that's right. Response 5: Where has this family planning come from? Famine and land shortage If we contrast the Arcadia described by the elderly with current conditions as they are perceived by young couples complaining about the high cost ofliving these days, it would appear that an idyllic past had been disturbed only recently, thus justifying the common analytic focus on recent social and economic characteristics to explain change (e.g., Brass and Jolly 1993).Yet archival records from the colonial period and secondary literature con- tradict the elderly's perceptions. Food may have often been abundant in Nyanza, but famines appear to have been frequent (Anderson 1984). At a meeting of the South Kavirondo 4 Local Native Council (LNC) on 22 May 1931, the District Commissionerreported that there was an infestation of locusts and that The Luo-Abasuba locations have suffered very heavy damage as regards their gramineous food crops. It is not too much to say that in most of these loca- tions they have been practically wiped out whilst as regards those that do remain there is every prospect of their being destroyed by flying swarms. Thesituation is most critical and as some of the Luo-Abasuba are already begin-SUSAN COTTS WATKINS 731 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsning to feel a shortage of food I do not see how a famine can be avoided. (Kenya, Colony and Protectorate 1931-37: Record 20) Famine did arrive, and in October in nearby Kisii district, the colonial gov- ernment made famine relief arrangements (ibid.: Record 90). MichaelWhisson, who conducted field research in Nyanza in 1961 and 1962, offers similar evidence of food shortages for a later period. Elders say that the land was more fertile in the past and produced better crops, but in many seasons there must have been difficulties in feeding the family,and force is given to this by the memories of the old men who tend to divide recent history into periods between and during famines. (Whisson 1964: 53) The 1965 annual report of the Ministry of Health reports that in Nyanza \"The drought added more grief to the 1961/62 flood victims as crops in their shambas , on which they had worked so hard, dried up completely. They had to remainon famine-relief food supplies\" (Kenya, Republic of n.d.: 12). Contrary to the collective memory of the elderly and the emphasis of analysts on land shortage as a stimulus for fertility decline, land may nothave been so abundant in the past. After Kenya became a colony, a stream of white settlers led the colonial government to displace many Kenyan farm- ers to Native Reserves, and by the 1930s the colonial government had cometo perceive the Reserves as overcrowded (Leys 1975; Kenya, Colony and Protectorate 1933: 349). Land pressures increased when customary law was codified in the 1950s, such that boundaries could no longer be adjustedaccording to changing family sizes (Shipton 1984). The population of nearby Central Nyanza was estimated to have approximately doubled between the 1920s and the 1960s (Whisson 1964; see also Molnos 1972). 5 The past of plenty now recalled by the elderly may never have existed, and\u2014if we can believe the accounts of colonial bureaucrats and other observ- ers at the time\u2014certainly did not exist when the elderly we interviewed werethemselves in their childbearing years. Memory is not only faulty but can be skillfully used to justify one's own past behavior and in arguments with one's children. Yet the perception that children were the way to wealth appears tohave been based on observational evidence. Although presumably many large families suffered from famine and inadequate land during the colonial period, it is likely that virtually all Luos who were perceived as relatively rich wereobserved to have many children, if for no other reason than that wealth was measured in cows, and in this polygamous society cows could be used to buy more wives who produced more children. It is local perceptions that go intothe creation of local cultural models, not the perceptions of outside analysts. The \"children are wealth\" model was compelling enough to guide behavior, and, perhaps because of its association with respected Luo elders, it still plays arole in community conversations.732 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsUndermining the traditional model of reproduction During the colonial period, participation in a monetary economy became necessary and desirable. The colonial government imposed taxes in order that Kenyans would have to work for the wazungu . More significant, per- haps, is that Nyanza became integrated into a colonial economy that of- fered attractive consumer goods. As Marion Levy noted, there are no people who fail to distinguish between being relatively better off and relatively worseoff materially (Levy 1972: 9). When we asked an old man whether he was better off now than when he was a child, he answered \"Yes,\" explaining that in the old days they slept on skins, but then \"their eyes opened andthey slept on blankets\" (interview, 1996). Another elderly man said that when he was growing up, \"you couldn't buy dresses [clothing] because dresses were not there, people only wore skins.... These things could onlybe bought when the wazungu came\" (interview, 1996). 6 Migrants to the urban areas returned to Nyanza in European attire with money and new goods (Odinga 1997), stimulating those who had remained at home to imag-ine the \"possible lives\" that were now available and to consider how they might be achieved (Appadurai 1990; see also Pigg 1992). Most of the paying jobs were as laborers on white settler farms or in the cities\u2014unstable employment with no educational requirements. But the British also wanted Africans as teachers, ministers, secretaries, clerks, inter- preters, messengers, nurses, orderlies, drivers, foremen, and soldiers (Chanai-wa 1994: 217). Education was a prerequisite for these desirable jobs, which offered relatively high and stable income. Western schooling was introduced by missionaries, with particular con- centration in Nyanza as well as Central Province (Ndege 1996: 67; see also Makau 1995). Although education's most important role in this story of changing reproductive models was as a strategy to achieve goals of wealth,education was perceived to offer more than that. It was associated with what is now called \"enlightenment\" and \"awareness,\" it permitted young people to challenge the traditional elites, and it provided \"a ladder to an altogetherdifferent world of increased financial reward and enhanced social status\" (Lonsdale 1968: 138; Wilson 1994: 205). The income and life style of the educated who became successful would have provided evidence to their neighbors of the returns to educating chil- dren. For example, at a meeting to discuss the annual budget of a Local Native Council in Nyanza, one of its members stated that \"Education wasthe great factor for advance in the District, and that if the vote was reduced, the District would go back\" (Kenya, Colony and Protectorate 1931-37; see also Ogot 1963). 7 When John D. Rockefeller 3rd visited Kenya a decade later, he wrote in his diary that a group of elite Kenyans had told him, \"The main problem facing the African today is how to get more education for their children. There is a demand for education among rural as well as ur-SUSAN COTTS WATKINS 733 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsban Africans\" (Rockefeller 1948). By the end of the colonial period, the Luos' desire to educate their children was apparently even more desperate: One of the most important recurrent items has been school fees, which have made increasing demands upon the workers outside the tribal area. Families reared to school age have increased and the pressure to have the childreneducated has likewise increased. Such expenditure does not end with feesbut includes clothes; boarding fees in some cases; pocket money for the olderchildren; prestige items (smart shoes, cosmetics for the bigger girls); trans-port to and from school; and books. These are big demands upon the income of the working man.... (Whisson 1964: 78) New ideas also accompanied the British. Dow, Kekovole, and Archer (1997) speculate that during the colonial period in Kenya Africans weredrawn not only into a modern economy but also into a new value constel- lation. In addition to the images of life in Britain displayed in schoolbooks (Rodney 1994: 210), there was informal education by advertisements innewspapers and on the radio, and by \"examples from life-styles of the Afri- can and settler bourgeoisie\" (Chanaiwa 1994: 220). In Nyanza, these new ideas were controversial, stimulating \"a six-decade long colloquy among allsorts of people about culture, markers, boundaries, core values, ethnicities\" (Cohen and Atieno Odhiambo 1989: 35). Observation of the wazungu during the colonial period may also have influenced the formulation of a small-family model. In the 1930s, Africans came into increasing contact with the machinery of central government, much of it British (Lonsdale 1968). Wazungu today are widely perceived to be rich, and the gap in material wealth between wazungu and the few edu- cated and employed Kenyans was no doubt even greater in the past. The wazungu were also perceived to have fewer children than the Kenyans. An interview in 1996 with Dr. Samson Mwathi, a cofounder of the Family Planning Association of Kenya, offers a glimpse of the ways in which interaction between Kenyans and wazungu might have contributed to the formulation of small-family models. When Dr. Mwathi was practicing in Nairobi in the early 1950s, railway workers came to him to ask about fertil- ity control. In a typescript of his memoirs he wrote: They [the men] would ask me, \"Dr. Mwathi, we know you are a clever person. Could you please advise us how we could have fewer children as we know Eu-ropeans just produce the number of children they require. What do they do tomanage this?\" Many people came from the Railway Lines in Nairobi; others came from some other areas in the town, others from Kabete, others from as far as Nyeri district. Since Europeans were concentrated in the large cities and in the White High- lands of Central Province, however, their reproductive patterns were far734 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsless visible to those in Nyanza. Luos in contact with the British may have assumed a correlation between their wealth and family size, but I doubt whether this contact was sufficient to challenge the traditional model or influence the formulation of a new one. The private family planning pro-gram of the Family Planning Association of Kenya was small, and I found no evidence that it reached South Nyanza. Thus, although European examples may have played a small role in the formulation of such patterns, the pri-mary provocations were widespread and profound changes in Nyanza itself. All of these changes\u2014new goods, employment, education, ideas\u2014under- mined the model of \"children are wealth\" and provoked the formulation of anew model of reproduction. David Parkin's fieldwork in the late 1960s shows the two models simultaneously at play among urban Luos. When the Luo talked politics with other Luos, they used the traditional model of reproduction; whenthey talked privately, they referred to an alternative, small-family model. The Luo emphasize that polygyny and large families continue to be politi- cally and economically important under urban conditions. But this empha- sis, verbally expressed in traditional terms, conflicts with an increasingly held view that monogamy and few children facilitate a heavier financial invest-ment in their education than is possible with a larger number. The \"custom-ary\" view of population expansion as the means of cultural self-perpetuationand political and economic survival is expressed in speeches at public meet- ings of Luos.... The contrary view, that personal and family success depends on monogamy, few children and their full education, is confined to the pri-vate and informal speech of friends and confidants. (Parkin 1978: 10, 11) Parkin's fieldwork occurred after the end of the colonial period, but it is likely that the new model had begun to be privately articulated before In-dependence and was largely indigenous. 8 As the \"many children\" strategy came to be undermined by the struc- tural changes and new ideas that accompanied Kenya's integration into aglobal economy and polity, uncertainty about the relation between chil- dren and wealth led to the formulation of a new, indigenous model of re- production, one that saw a small family as an alternative route to progress. The relation of children to wealth after Independence The evidence for the formulation of a small-family model of reproduction before Independence is sparse. Shortly afterward, however, a limited butquantitative comparison of the traditional model and the new small-family model becomes possible. Because the early surveys follow the undermining of the traditional model and because they precede significant local activityby the international population movement, they shed light on the questionSUSAN COTTS WATKINS 735 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentswhether an indigenous small-family model of the relation between chil- dren and wealth was available in rural Nyanza. Survey data from the 1960s In 1966, Donald Heisel conducted a survey that interviewed a sample of744 women of reproductive age living in rural areas dominated by six ofthe seven largest ethnic groups, including the Luo. The most sensitive indi- cator of changed perceptions that Heisel's survey provides is the proportion of women wanting no more children. If many children were perceived asthe route to wealth, as claimed by the elderly, there would be no reason to want to cease childbearing. Thirty percent among the survey's respondents said they wanted no more children. The proportion saying \"want no more\"rises rapidly for women with more than two children: 17 percent of those who had three children wanted no more, 28 percent of those with four children, and so on until 100 percent of those with 10+ children wanted nomore (Heisel 1968: 637). 9 These percentages suggest the onset of a pro- found cultural transformation. There was clearly collective uncertainty about large versus small fami- lies: 38 percent of Heisel's sample could find \"nothing good at all\" about large families, 11 percent could find \"nothing bad\" in large families, with the majority unsure. The largest problem perceived to accompany manychildren was economic strain (75 percent of the responses) (ibid.: 635). A survey conducted by Angela Molnos in 1965-66 included 2,648 pu- pils of 43 primary and secondary schools in the seventh to tenth grades. 10 The students presumably were unmarried; thus, what they said about fam- ily size must be based on observation of their married agemates' and par- ents' experiences rather than their own.11 In the present context Molnos's survey has two advantages over Heisel's: Molnos asks more questions about perceptions; and because her study was done in areas around Lake Victoria, it speaks more specifically to Luo perceptions. Students were asked to complete sentences such as \"A woman with only one child...\" or \"A man with many children....\" Molnos herself favored fertility decline in Kenya, and thus categorizes the responses as \"positive,\"\"ambivalent,\" or \"negative,\" giving examples. The positive reactions express the traditional model: children bring wealth to their parents. Clearly, there was collective uncertainty about family size in the community, consistentwith Heisel's survey. About half of the students completed the sentence \"A woman with many children\" positively and a fifth negatively. Male respondents perceived the burdens of children as largely eco- nomic, consistent with a household economy that gives men the responsi- bility of meeting needs that must be paid in cash. Nearly half of the respon- dents said that for fathers of many children education is difficult, there isnot enough food or money, and there is too much work (Molnos 1968:736 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contents142). The most frequent comments combined education and lack of money: he \"is suffering from where to get money to educate his children with\"; he \"is always poor because his money goes for paying school fees\"; and he \"cannot be rich enough to send all his children to school\" (ibid.: 140). Be-fore Luos entered a cash economy, the primary economic burdens on men were providing enough cattle to allow their sons to marry. By the mid- 1960s, their responsibilities had greatly increased. Mothers of many children were seen to be burdened by work that has both an economic and a noneconomic component. The mother of many chil- dren \"has nothing to dress them nor enough food to feed them,\" and she \"mustsee that they are well fed, or else some will begin stealing other people's food\" (ibid.: 135). In addition, she \"is dirty because she is in great work of keeping them.\" She \"has a hard time; they are always fighting and eating much foodand don't get satisfied\"; and she \"has a lot of trouble even if her husband is there. Men here don't play a good part in children's care\" (ibid.: 135-136). The mother of many children is described as reaching the end of her tether. She\"sometimes wishes that she had not given birth\"; and, even more vividly, she \"wants to kill them and some to sell them as [for? like?] a fish\" (ibid.). Perceptions that small families are progressive Molnos's survey provides evidence that as early as the mid-1960s some Luoshad come to perceive not only that many children were burdensome, but, more significantly, that a small family was progressive. A couple with fewchildren \"expects many things from their future\"; a man with few children \"is strong because his children are educated\" (Molnos 1968: 147). Urban life is clearly modern, progressive, and desirable (Williams 1973). The malerespondents add that towns offer satisfaction of desires for \"up-to-date in- formation,\" and the female respondents \"appreciate first of all the variety of amusements and human contacts\" (Molnos 1968: 79). 12 Yet despite the perceptions that many children were burdensome and that small families offered an alternative route to wealth, Molnos's respon- dents objected to deliberate control of family size within marriage, distin-guishing between couples who had a small family by happenstance and those who made a deliberate decision. Molnos compares responses to the sen- tence \"A couple who has three children...\" and the sentence \"A young mar-ried couple who decided not to have many children....\" Since both ques- tions refer to smaller families, it is reasonable to expect that the responses would be similar. 13 However, the means by which the goal of a small family was achieved appears to color the responses. If a small family just happened, 16 percent of respondents felt that educating them would be easy. But when a small family was achieved deliberately, only 2 percent began by sayingthat educating them would be easy. Similar discrepant responses are found for the categories easy,\" and \"rich.\" I interpretSUSAN 737 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthese discrepancies as indicating that deliberate control was felt to be illicit, so that the same objective\u2014a family smaller than \"many\"\u2014was interpreted differently according to the means by which it was achieved. Some respondents described people who deliberately limit their fam- ily size as \"foolish,\" \"stupid,\" \"unwise,\" or \"mentally unbalanced.\" Other responses have a moral tone: the couple was acting against custom, nature, or God. The moral nature of the transgression is also seen in responses thatdescribe the punishment of those who deliberately controlled fertility. The couple who chose few children \"died without having any child\"; \"God took back all their children\"; and, interesting in light of then-President JomoKenyatta's lack of support for birth control, the couple \"was one day pun- ished by the ruler of the country\" (Molnos 1968: 153-154). Although a few references speak directly to \"medicines,\" the examples given suggest thatfor most it is the deliberate choice that is illicit, rather than the means. 14 The small minority of respondents who explicitly approved of deliber- ate control described the planned family as modern, in keeping with theoptimism following Independence. In his Independence Day speech in De- cember 1965, Kenyatta celebrated the opportunities available to Kenyans after the end of British rule: \"For the man today who wants to travel or to move his produce, new roads are there. For a man who wants a farm, there is the settlement programme. For thefamily seeking education, there are new schools....\" (quoted in Lonsdale 1997: 12) The small family deliberately achieved is perceived as positioning its mem- bers to take advantage of the promised new opportunities. It is progres- sive\u2014the couple \"will be interesting in our new Kenya,\" and they \"are people who have a predilection for modern life\"; and it is urban\u2014the couple \"wentto live in a town.\" There are also hints of foreign examples in the com- ments about the planned family: one respondent wrote \"as they are edu- cated they have copied the English manners\" (Molnos 1968: 151). A 1974survey provides evidence of continued optimism: two-thirds of both urban and rural respondents said they expected their daughters as well as their sons to attend a university (Anker and Knowles 1982: 47). The international population movement comes to Kenya In the late 1950s, the wazungu model of deliberate family limitation began to be actively promoted by private family planning associations in Nairobi and Mombasa, subsequently amalgamated into the Family Planning Asso-ciation of Kenya and supported by the Pathfinder Fund, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, and other donors. Foreign activity increased after Independence, when a multitude of global actors arrived to offer thenew sovereign state advice on how to become wealthy through develop-738 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsment in such areas as land distribution, education, family law, and repro- duction (Watkins and Hodgson 1998; Grindle 1996; Leys 1975). Following a visit by a mission from the Population Council in 1965, the Kenyan government adopted (in 1967) the mission's recommenda-tions\u2014verbatim\u2014as its population policy (Watkins and Hodgson 1998). This policy was neo-Malthusian: it set targets for lower fertility and urged the deliberate control of fertility through a government family planning pro-gram. Yet although President Kenyatta's government adopted this wazungu model of reproduction, he did not support it, and for many years attempts to persuade Kenyans of the importance of using family planning to limitfamily size were made primarily by the Family Planning Association of Kenya and by wazungu . There were efforts to reinterpret family planning as Afri- can: for example, an Association supervisor told an audience in Kisumu (acity near South Nyanza) that \"Family Planning is not a new idea in our African Society\" (Oyoo 1980). Nonetheless, the public face of family plan- ning was foreign: whites were estimated to hand out about 80 percent ofclinic-based methods (Miller 1971). Elite responses to the wazungu model In the early 1970s David Radel conducted a survey of policymakers for the Ford Foundation.15 His comments about the sample selection indicate the sensitivity of the issue of foreign participation in Kenya's affairs. The Kenyan collaborators on the survey refused to include Europeans or Indians in thesample, on the grounds that \"to have included them would have been tan- tamount to admitting that nationals were not completely in control of the destiny of the country\" (Radel 1973: 168, fn 6). Among elites interviewed in Radel's survey, the term birth control was associated with the notion of compulsory limitation of births and with for- eigners. A civil servant said, \"Already they are suspicious that this is a foreign idea in order to limit the popu- lation growth of developing countries so that they do not become in the future athreat to the already developed countries.... [E]ven here in our own situation in this country you can see that the bigger the tribe, the stronger the tribe; the smaller the tribe, the weaker the tribe. Now you expand that in the world ofpolitics and the world of power, it is identical.\" (quoted in Radel 1973: 235) The perception that birth control was foreign is also evident in Nyanza. The Family Planning Association of Kenya area officer for Nyanza wrote in the 1971 annual report: In the years before 1971, Nyanza Province posed a discouraging opposition to the Family Planning movement. This was necessarily so because most ofthe educated lot were still recalling the rather dubious way in which theSUSAN COTTS WATKINS 739 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentscolonialists introduced the movement as African Population Limitation fol- lowing the 1st population census in the three territories of East Africa. A gen-eral feeling still prevailed that Family Planning was a white man's trick aimed at curbing the black man's population with a view to eventual subjugation. (Obuya-Deya 1971: 1) An evaluation by the Food and Agriculture Organization's Programme for Better Family Living interviewed local fieldworkers about their experiencespromoting family planning in several towns of Kenya, including Kericho, near South Nyanza District. The fieldworkers noted many instances of op- position to their teaching. Although the authors blamed the \"culture andreligion\" of the rural Kenyans, their report also states that the fieldworkers faced the counter-argument that family planning was a foreign idea (Krystall, Berger, and Maleche 1973). Despite its foreign provenance, family planning slowly became domes- ticated among urban elites\u2014that is, some came to perceive it as Kenyan. In another survey of elites conducted in the late 1970s, shortly after a WorldBank loan had begun to make family planning available in some govern- ment clinics, one-third of the respondents agreed that family planning was a foreign idea (Ndeti and Ndeti 1980: 89). Interestingly, however, over halfsaid the program was Kenyan because it was run by the government and because family planning was a traditional Kenya custom (ibid.: 87). One respondent answered that although family planning was introduced fromoutside, \"now it is a Kenyan idea because the Family Planning Association of Kenya is a Kenyan organization\" (ibid.: 88). It is unlikely that the wazungu model of reproduction came to be per- ceived as local and Luo as early as it came to be interpreted by urban elites as Kenyan. Interpreting the new model as local and Luo could only hap- pen, I believe, when family planning was adopted by Luo friends, relatives,and neighbors, people who could provide local examples and stories. There is no direct evidence of this process of domestication for the 1970s or 1980s. Moreover, although the Molnos survey shows that a small-family modelwas clearly available for consideration in Nyanza during the Kenyatta years, too few couples were practicing family planning to provide domestic stories for those considering the new model: in the 1977/78 Kenya World FertilitySurvey, only 1.6 percent of women in union in Nyanza used some method of birth control other than postpartum abstinence (Brass and Jolly 1993: 95). Rural Luos domesticate the wazungu model Old uncertainties in a new context In South Nyanza in the summer of 1994, we conducted semistructured in- terviews with men and women and focus group discussions with women740 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contents(the women were all of reproductive age). These data show current social interactions related to family planning. South Nyanza is still rural, the economy is primarily subsistence agriculture, and there are few of the sym- bols of modernization and progress, such as good roads and electricity. None-theless, the area is not isolated from global flows: for example, one man wore a T-shirt saying Bethany Beach, Delaware (a small US vacation re- sort), and in our research site on an island in Lake Victoria, village soccerfans with radios kept us informed of the World Cup scores. In order to understand the role of social interaction in reproductive behavior, we asked about conversations on family size and family planning.These conversations, both as recalled and as they occurred in focus groups, reprise some of the themes of earlier decades. But change has continued to occur, and the tune is somewhat different. Two themes that persist are the economic and noneconomic burdens of children. School fees loom large, but there are also medical fees and the costs of clothing, and the purchase of food when the harvest is insufficient.Women still complain about childbearing and rearing. Some talked about the inability to wear fashionable clothing if they were always pregnant or breastfeeding. Fashionable clothing is far more widely available now thanit was when the elderly were children, in large part because of the develop- ment of a vigorous market in secondhand clothing from the West (Hansen 1994). Although fashion may appear trivial compared to the male respon-sibilities for school fees, it is a way of expressing a sense of self, of personal and group identity, and as such it did not appear trivial to some women. More common were the complaints about taking care of children, such asone woman's remark that \"I didn't like the idea of this child is crying here, another one urinating there.\" As in the 1960s, women said that men do not \"play a good part in children's care.\" What differs from the 1960s is that the consideration of reproductive models now takes place in a climate of pessimism, unlike the optimism of the Kenyatta years that ended in 1978, and in a setting where family plan-ning is promoted and readily available. Economic hardship is not new: the Local Native Council was urging more funds for education during the Depression of the 1930s, which hitNyanza hard. But after World War II and continuing to the late 1970s, Kenya experienced a considerable increase in prosperity. 16 Subsequently, however, economic decline set in. Particularly important at the local level were theWorld Bank structural adjustment programs that introduced cost-sharing in education and health, thus placing a greater burden on parents (Kelley and Nobbe 1990), and inflation. Inflation appears to have made a particularly vivid mark, and the high prices of the present were often compared to what are recalled as the low prices of the past. Inflation averaged about 11 percent a year since the1970s, but had been much higher in the years immediately preceding ourSUSAN COTTS WATKINS 741 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsresearch.17 The high prices of today were often emphasized in informal con- versations that included desperate requests for help with school fees, but they were also emphasized when we asked people to compare their lives as children with their lives today. One morning in 1996 I sat in the kitchen of the guest house where we were staying and asked one of the cooks whether she thought her life was better now than when she was growing up (she is now about 45). She an-swered (in English) that it was better then, and explained: \"Life now is very high. When I was young a shilling and a half bought one big fish, but now a big fish is 100 shillings. And a big piece of meat was 1 shilling, now it is100.\" After getting her to compare what her household has now and what her childhood household offered, I pointed out that she and her husband have far more possessions than her family did when she was small, but sherefused to agree, insisting that \"Now things are so high.\" In other inter- views as well, despite persistent probing, people refused to agree that their lives were better today. The discrepancy between local perceptions and whatappears from the outside to be the case is striking. But as with the elderly's perception that children are a form of wealth, it is local perceptions that drive local reproductive models. The family planning program now offers a solution. Because President Kenyatta did not support the government's family planning policy, few serv- ices were offered through the Ministry of Health. By the time Daniel arapMoi succeeded Kenyatta in 1978, power differentials had altered. Moi's po- litical position was weak and the economic downturn had made foreign funds more important to the Kenyan government (Grindle 1996; Widner1992). In addition, the international population movement was far stron- ger than it had been when Kenyatta came to power, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had added social aims to their finan-cial functions (Watkins and Hodgson 1998; Bordo and James 2000; Brechin 1997; Escobar 1995). Moi began tentatively: addressing officials of the Family Planning Association of Kenya, he interpreted the foreign model as simplya version of African birth spacing customs, and urged parents to have only the number of children they could support ( Daily Nation 1979). The World Bank and the IMF flexed their muscles, threatening to withhold funds un-less the Kenyan government took a more active role in reducing popula- tion growth. Moi may also have been subject to social influence from global networks: he complained that \"Whenever I go to international conferences,people point out at me saying that 'that is the leader of the people with the highest population growth rate in the world'\" (quoted in Shaw 1983: 17; see also Meyer et al. 1997). Moi's verbal support for fertility reduction esca-lated. He spoke about the dangers of population growth and threatened to fire civil servants who had more than three children ( Daily Nation 1987). Although Moi's reiterated public support for population control and family planning appears to have been strongly influenced by outsiders, it742 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentshad three important consequences: it provoked public debate, energized donors, and galvanized support from the Ministry of Health. For several years following Moi's public commitment to smaller families and lower fer- tility, there were articles pro and con in the Kenyan press.18 In 1980, an article in the Weekly Review said that when Moi spoke out, politicians fol- lowed and the government adopted \"blunter terminology and tactics\" ( Weekly Review 1980: 13). The editors of the Weekly Review and the Daily Nation wrote in favor of the new efforts (Shaw 1983; Daily Nation 1984). Such statements provoked opposition, expressed publicly in articles and letters from readers arguing that family planning was not the solution to the population bomb(Gatara 1984), that the family planning program was not paying enough attention to Kenyan cultural values and was too dependent on foreign ex- perts, especially in policy formation and financing (Ikiara 1982), and thatKenyans were taking to \"blind borrowing of western development models which they impose on the people\" (Odegi-Owuondo 1984). This public de- bate probably stimulated private discussion, much as happened after theBradlaugh-Besant trial in late-eighteenth-century England (Caldwell 1999). After Moi supported family planning, donors responded energetically. Between 1972 and 1978, the US Agency for International Development spenton average $611,000 per year for family planning in Kenya; between 1979 and 1985, the average was $2,389,000, and from 1986 to 1992 it was $10,655,000 (Deborah Barrett, personal communication 1999; see alsoBarrett and Tsui 1999). In 1987 116 agencies were active in population and family planning in Nairobi, of which approximately 25 were donors and most of the rest were donor-funded (Krystall and Schneller 1987). 19 Relying largely on foreign funding, the Kenyan government developed a relatively aggressive (but not coercive) government family planning pro- gram, led by a galvanized Ministry of Health, and methods of family plan-ning gradually came to be widely known and accessible. \"Family planning talks\" for mothers waiting in the maternal and child health clinics and indi- vidual counseling on family planning became routine (Ndhlovu et al. 1996),even though the counselors themselves remained suspicious about some of the program's directives well after the shift in policy under Moi (Khasiani and Muganzi 1988). Clinic-based activities were supported by media cam-paigns and posters that promoted the wazungu model. Tushauriane , a radio program that promoted family planning, was said to be the most popular show in Kenya when it was aired between 1987 and 1989 (Population In-formation Program 1989: 22). By the 1980s family planning services were being distributed by Kenyans, not foreigners; the latter were behind the scenes providing tech-nical assistance and funding in Nairobi (World Bank 1992). Nonetheless, the foreign flavor of the programs may have provoked suspicion. The post- ers that I saw either in the clinics or in archives 20 were clearly foreign to Luo-speaking Nyanza: they were in English or Kiswahili (spoken by a mi-SUSAN COTTS WATKINS 743 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsnority of our respondents) and pictured generic Africans rather than iden- tifiable Luos.21 Tellingly, some respondents referred to modern methods by the English term \"family planning,\" usually shortened to \"family,\" or by the Kiswahili term panga uzazi. The posters are, however, adapted to the context of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the 1960s. They stress the burdens of many children, rather than the opportunities perceived by the respondents in Molnos's survey such as going \"to live in a town.\" The most striking difference between our study in the mid-1990s and that of Molnos in the mid-1960s is that almost all our respondents treated the decision to practice or not practice family planning as a legitimate choice,to be made on grounds other than morality. In our semistructured inter- views only a few men and women said that others (not themselves) be- lieved that family planning was against God's will or that a woman should\"finish all the eggs in her body,\" and a small proportion in the household survey gave a similar response. It may be, however, that there are lingering doubts about the licitness of family planning, expressed in guarded terms.For example, concerns about side effects sometimes evoke earlier objec- tions to deliberate control: stories of women who used family planning and gave birth to deformed children (Rutenberg and Watkins 1997). Considering the wazungu model By the mid-1990s, most of those we interviewed considered fertility con- trol a legitimate choice. What the decision should be, however, was still not obvious. The conversations about family size that our respondents reported were suffused with ambivalence about models of reproduction (Watkins,Rutenberg, and Green 1995; see also Bledsoe 1994). Ambivalence was particularly evident when we asked about respon- dents' expectations that their children would support them in old age. Par-ents thought it right for their children to support them when they are too old to care for themselves, but many were concerned that their children might only manage to support themselves; others knew of children wholeft the village and forgot about the old folks back home. Another major source of uncertainty about the wazungu model was mor- tality, which was perceived to be low among wazungu but high among Luos: The reason why we can't have few is the medical side. You have many and a few will die, so eventually you have a few. It is the wazungus who introduced family planning. This is because their children don't die. But ours keep on dying.... (male respondent, 1994) Declines in infant and child mortality occurred in Nyanza, although the rates have recently risen, probably because of the relatively high levels of HIV/ AIDS: some of our respondents commented \"there are so many diseases744 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthese days\" (Rutaremwa 1999; Kenya, Republic of 1998).22 The respondents in Molnos's survey three decades earlier, however, did not appear to per- ceive mortality declines either, and in our household survey in 1996-97 over 90 percent of both male and female respondents believed that chil-dren were more likely to die now than when they themselves were chil- dren, a time well before AIDS. Perhaps it is too difficult to perceive declines in infant and child mortality when observation shows more frequent infantand child funerals, a consequence of population growth (Montgomery 1998). In their ambivalence about family size, men and women evaluate al- ternative reproductive models, as the following illustrates: The famine was so severe that people who had many children found it very tough. There was a young boy who passed by where we were waiting to becollected to come here, so I imagined that people who have boys of that sizemust be finding it rough feeding them during the famine. Two kilograms offlour is nothing to them. Still, some people say that having many children isa good thing, especially when it comes to work like during the weeding. Large families are able to weed their farms within a short time. 23 (female focus group participant, 1994) As in many of the conversations described to us, more than one reproductive model is under consideration: less food to be bought versus faster weeding.The traditional model of many children as wealth may be expressed in a vari- ety of terms\u2014here it is agricultural production rather than the bridewealth emphasized by an earlier generation\u2014but it is still considered a reasonable op-tion. The small-family model is, however, no longer so closely associated with opportunities for progress, but rather with reduced economic burdens. By the mid-1990s, the optimism of the early Kenyatta years had largely evaporated. Although some associated few children with potential, for most the advantage of a small number of children is that they can be educated. Having \"enlightened\" children is still intrinsically desirable. Now, however,the high levels of unemployment even among those who finish secondary school and university mean that educated children are seen less as a route to progress than as the only conceivable way to avoid further impoverish-ment. The burdens of children are now contrasted not with small families achieved by happenstance but with small families achieved through the de- liberate and licit use of clinic-based methods of family planning. Domesticating the wazungu model in rural Nyanza Some of the terms of local Luo debates about models of reproduction are set outside\u2014sometimes far outside\u2014the local communities (McNicoll 1983). The prices of some goods are determined by national and international mar-SUSAN COTTS WATKINS 745 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentskets, whereas the prices of others, such as schooling and medical care, are set by the government and influenced by international agencies such as the IMF and World Bank (Kelley and Nobbe 1990). The local conversations do- mesticate the foreign by creating a common calculus of costs and benefits.They define the salient categories of costs and benefits and establish a weight- ing system; they also display publicly the arguments and evidence that are legitimate in the particular local context. The elements of the good life thatare jointly constructed are expressed in down-to-earth terms that reflect men's and women's domestic responsibilities and their visions of \"possible lives\": weeding, store-bought baby powder, daily meals, school fees, supportwhen they are old, a bit of peace and quiet without noisy children. Just as an elite urban respondent commented in the late 1970s that fam- ily planning was Kenyan because it was distributed by the Family PlanningAssociation of Kenya, the routinization of family planning talks in local mater- nal and child health clinics contributes to making family planning Luo. The nurses we met were Luo; they live in the communities and some are fromSouth Nyanza; they speak Luo and understand the local context. The clinics are important but not sufficient, however: a social distance between nurses and local women needs to be bridged, and their talks on family planning needto be reinterpreted within local networks (Rutenberg and Watkins 1997). By the mid-1990s, many women used, or had used, family planning and could provide stories of their own experience, or serve as the topic ofgossip by others. 24 Both men and women tell of individuals they know or have heard about who have used family planning, why they did so, and the consequences: for example, some are said to become healthy and plump,while others experience side effects because the white man's medicine did not \"rhyme with her blood\" (Watkins, Rutenberg, and Green 1995; Rutenberg and Watkins 1997; Watkins, Rutenberg and Wilkinson 1997).The most vivid stories justify women's decisions to use family planning (\"family\") secretly because their husbands do not approve: Some women want to tell their husbands, rather than ask first, but the hus- band might refuse. But, you see, it is the women who feel the burden, likewhen she is sick with the pregnancy, she is the one suffering, when the chil-dren disturb her, she is the one suffering. And when you tell the husband about \"family\" [in English] he cannot agree\u2014this forces women to go and do \"family\" secretly because she's the one feeling the burden. (female focus groupparticipant, 1994) Conversations about family planning are frequent: in the 1996-97 house- hold survey, 82 percent of women and 75 percent of men reported talking with someone about the topic, and approximately 50 percent of both menand women had done so in the past month.746 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThe interpretation of conversations in local networks as domesticating the wazungu model of family planning is supported by our household sur- veys, which show that the social distance between women and their con- versational partners is small (Watkins and Warriner 1999). Women talkabout family planning with others who are much like themselves, rather than those higher on the social scale. When respondents were asked why they selected these particular people to talk with about family planning,they shrugged, explaining \"these are people I see all the time,\" or \"these are the people I am close to,\" or \"these are women like me.\" The influence of these conversations may be even stronger when the network partnersare not only connected to the respondent but know each other and when the respondent believes her network partners practice family planning. The network partners we interviewed often contradicted the respondents' per-ceptions (White and Watkins forthcoming). Nonetheless, when peers are per- ceived not to practice family planning, the respondent is also unlikely to do so; when network partners who know each other are perceived to practice family planning, the respondent herself is likely to do so (Kohler, Behrman, and Watkins forthcoming). 25 Discussion and wider implications I have described three cultural models of reproduction under consideration by Luo men and women during the past six decades. The provenance of these models matters to this history. Two are perceived by Luos as local, the third is foreign\u2014although it is in the process of becoming Luo. The firstis a large-family model of children as the route to riches. It is described by Luos as traditional and is associated with a past of supposed abundance. Although this perception of abundance is contradicted by records from thecolonial period and the traditional model had already begun to be under- mined when the elderly who now defend it were themselves in their child- bearing years, the power of this model is demonstrated by the fact that it isstill in play in local conversations. The second is a small-family model for- mulated by Luos in response to the changes during the colonial period, par- ticularly the introduction of attractive consumer goods and desirable jobsthat required education. This small-family model was indigenous and was associated with the progress expected to accompany development. Although it was a model of a small family achieved by happenstance rather than choice,it paved the way for consideration of the third model, which adds the delib- erate limitation of family size through the use of clinic-based methods of contraception. This wazungu model was introduced and broadcast by the international population movement. The formulation of the Luo small-family model, the translation of the wazungu model of deliberate choice and clinic- based methods into local terms, and the diffusion of both models were keyfactors facilitating the increase, mea sured in surveys, in the proportion want-SUSAN COTTS WATKINS 747 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsing no more children and the proportion using family planning, and thus for the resulting recent declines in fertility. I have emphasized the decades of cultural activity that created and altered reproductive models. This cultural activity was provoked by outsideactors and conducted by local \"communication communities\" (see also Szreter 1993: 523). Fertility declines, if and when they occur, are almost invariably portrayed as resulting entirely from the agency of individual lo-cal actors: colonial governments and the World Bank are rarely seen, nor are gossip networks. 26 But in Kenya the small-family model and the wazungu model were influenced by powerful actors far from the shores of LakeVictoria and were formulated, altered, and evaluated in local networks. The colonizers of Kenya played a crucial role in stimulating uncertain- ties about the traditional model, for they changed the context in which re-productive decisions were made. They moved Kenyans into native reserves and imposed taxes, and they integrated Kenya into an imperial polity and economy that offered new forms of wealth and new strategies to achievethem. Wealth came to be measured not only by cattle and wives but also by new styles of clothing and baby powder; increasingly, Luos came to per- ceive that educating children who could work in the city would be a morepromising route to riches. Together, new visions of a good life and new strategies to achieve it undermined the model of \"children as wealth,\" lead- ing to the formulation of a \"small family is progressive\" model. The integration of Kenya into a global economy and polity surged af- ter Independence, bringing a new crowd of global actors scrambling to offer advice and funds. The good life for the country and its families was de-scribed by development experts, both international and national, in the lan- guage of modernization: roads, industries, education, and health care for all. The new image of modernity was spread widely by migrants and themedia, and the economic growth of the 1960s and 1970s must have made modernity appear attainable. For this story of change in reproductive models, the arrival of foreign- ers alarmed by population growth and ready to provide family planning methods was particularly significant. The international population move- ment propagated a new cultural model of reproduction, displayed in post-ers of well-dressed small families and squalid large ones that reiterated the indigenous \"small family is progressive\" model already under consideration. In the mid-1960s, international population leaders persuaded PresidentKenyatta to adopt a family planning policy but could not overcome his re- sistance to implementing it. Under President Moi, who succeeded Kenyatta in 1978, the balance of power changed. Moi was politically weaker and theeconomy had deteriorated; moreover, the population movement was stron- ger, and global financial actors were not only more powerful but also more committed to directing and supporting social change in developing coun-tries. Moi agreed to the conditions imposed by the World Bank and the748 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsIMF and he supported the wazungu model. Whatever Moi's personal beliefs about reproduction, as the head of an autocratic regime his publicly reiter- ated support energized donors, galvanized the Ministry of Health, and pro- voked intense debate in the press and, presumably, at home. Altering reproductive models does not appear to have occurred quickly: the seeds of the Luo small-family model are evident in Nyanza in the 1930s, but it was articulated only by a minority on surveys in the 1960s. Addingthe wazungu model to the previous two models was perhaps even more difficult. \"Cultural barriers,\" often mentioned by proponents of lower fer- tility and family planning, are invariably perceived to be exotic aspects oflocal cultures. From the perspective of Nyanza the cultural barrier was the exotic wazungu model. The foreign provenance of the wazungu model gave it power through its association with people perceived to be wealthy, but it also provoked suspicion: white foreigners were not only \"gentlemen\" but also \"strange, tricky.\" Not until the wazungu model was domesticated was it perceived by significant numbers of Luos as a possible guide for their own reproduction. The process of domestication was not so much individual as commu- nal, involving both Kenyan institutions and Luo social networks. The ac-tive promotion of family planning by the government was important. Fam- ily planning services, although largely funded behind the scenes by foreign donors, increasingly became an integral part of the daily routines of gov-ernment clinics. Today, Luo nurses and community-based distribution agents help to domesticate the wazungu model by promoting family planning serv- ices with a Luo face. They also engage in cultural activity by modifying andeven actively subverting the international guidelines adopted by the gov- ernment. Although this is often criticized as \"provider bias,\" the nurses and agents reinterpret the rules for distributing family planning to bring themin line with local norms (Kaler and Watkins 1999). An even more critical step in the domestication of the wazungu model is now occurring in local networks, as men and women in the villages ofSouth Nyanza observe friends, relatives, and neighbors practicing family planning, and as they gossip about other Luos they knew who had smaller (or larger) families. It may be that at an earlier stage of Nyanza's fertilitytransition informal networks were important for transmitting information about clinic-based methods and their availability. Now, however, the con- versations evaluate the \"children are wealth,\" \"small families are progres-sive,\" and wazungu models of reproduction in the context of local circum- stances and uncertainties. The networks permit those for whom the wazungu model is attractive to voice the arguments and evidence for the new modelof reproduction in local terms and to gauge the responses of their friends, relatives, and neighbors. The preceding history of alterations and emendations of cultural mod- els is specific to Nyanza, yet some of the themes have also been emphasizedSUSAN COTTS WATKINS 749 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsby others and some aspects may be generalizable to other places and other issues.27 It is likely that had Kenya not become a British colony, and had the international population movement not been active in Kenya, a similar succession of models would nevertheless have occurred in Nyanza: connec-tions across time and space construct \"what is imaginable and what is po- litically possible,\" whether a country was a colony or not (Cooper forth- coming). Countries that were never colonies are now integrated in a globaleconomy that offers attractive consumer goods and jobs that require edu- cation. Foreign advisers representing the international population move- ment were influential in the government's adoption of a population policy,but perhaps the influential Kenyans who studied abroad and returned to promote the wazungu model through the Family Planning Association of Kenya would have been equally successful. And other scenarios are pos-sible: local Luos might have come to perceive deliberate fertility control as licit, and might either have used their traditional methods of childspacing to stop childbearing or have learned of foreign methods through networksof students and workers that connect Kenya to other countries in Africa as well as the West. These are counterfactuals, however. After Independence Kenyans were not left to their own devices. Globalization is often defined by an increase in the range and density of networks (Giddens 1990; Robertson 1992). Flows of people, technologies, fi- nances, information, and ideologies will change the local context in places farfrom the centers of power, provoking reevaluation of cultural models (see, for example, Appadurai 1990; Hannerz 1997). Some of these flows are undirected, but greater globalization facilitates attempts to promote social change. It is un-likely that the attempts of global actors to alter the reproductive behavior of men and women in developing countries will cease. Absent marked changes in the global economy, power differentials between rich and poor countriesare likely to remain relevant, as they were for population control and family planning, and are now for the international reproductive health platform for- mulated at Cairo (Luke and Watkins 2000). Currently, international actors are engaged in propagating models of sexual behavior to control AIDS, and the interactions between these actors and the Luo community appear to be very similar to earlier interactionsaround reproductive models. In Nyanza AIDS, like family planning, was initially perceived to have been introduced by foreigners, perhaps with the same malicious intentions that were seen to motivate their promotion ofpopulation control. More significantly, models of prevention also come from outside. Global actors promote two wazungu models: chastity (for the un- married) and fidelity (for the married) or consistent use of condoms. Luoshave their own cultural models of sexual behavior, however, and there is local resistance to the adoption of these exotic\u2014and austere\u2014models; and again such resistance is labeled by experts as cultural barriers to behaviorchange.750 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThe preceding history of cultural change in Nyanza suggests, however, that it is helpful to think of culture as malleable rather than as a barrier, that the Luo models of sexual behavior will in fact change, and that the process of cultural change will be similar to that described for reproductivebehavior. In particular, it is likely that local networks will alter indigenous cultural models of sexual behavior and domesticate foreign ones. AIDS, once seen as an \"outside\" disease, is now being described in Uganda as \"this sick-ness of ours\" (quoted in Whyte 1997: 205), and in Nyanza we found Luos formulating local strategies for prevention (Watkins and Schatz forthcom- ing). Because the motivation to avoid AIDS may be even greater than themotivation to achieve progress through small families, the transformation of sexual models may occur more rapidly. Even so, the collective cultural process is likely to be similar to that which transformed the wazungu model of reproduction into a local Luo model.

Funding that permitted the collection of some of the data was provided by USAID's Evalua- tion Project, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health. Field super- visors and ethnographers and Ruth Waswa helped collect and interpret the data, as did colleagues Alan Ferguson and David Wilkinson and team members Laura Bernardi, Sam Clark, Nadra Franklin, Steven Green, Nancy Luke, Enid Schatz, and Alex Weinreb. 1 After our project began, South Nyanza District was divided into three districts: Suba, Karachuonyo, and Bay. Kawadghone, Obisa, Owich, and Wakula South. 2 However, change in these cultural pat- terns is difficult to measure. For example, gen- der relations may have changed, but no one referred to this in our interviews.3 In the 1978 World Fertility Survey the total fertility rate in Kenya was 8.2 and in Nyanza Province 8.1; 17 percent and 8 per- cent, respectively, of currently married women reported that they wanted no more children; and 8 percent and 9 percent, respectively, were using some method of family planning (Kenya, Republic of 1980). Subsequent Demographic and Health Surveys for Kenya and for Nyanza Province showed a steady decline in the total fertility rate and a steady increase in the pro- portion wanting no more children and prac- ticing family planning. According to the 1998 Demographic and Health Survey the total fer- tility rate for Kenya is 5.0 births per woman; for Nyanza the figure is 4.7. 4 South Kavirondo is the former name of a Luo-Abasuba area with approximately the same boundaries as South Nyanza District. Lo- cal Native Councils were instruments of Brit- ish indirect rule. 5 Whisson learned this from the District Commissioner at the time of his field research (Whisson, personal communication, 1999). 6 The term wazungu included former resi- dents of India and their descendants, who con- ducted much of the trade in rural areas. 7 The colonial bureaucrats recognized, and deferred to, the strength of popular interest in education. On 23 February 1932 the DistrictSUSAN COTTS WATKINS 751 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsCommissioner for South Nyanza wrote to the Provincial Commissioner, \"It is possible that the [Local Native] Council will object to cut- ting down any Education expenditure. In that case I take it nothing can be done, or at all events it would not be advisable to do any- thing in the matter\" (Kenya, Colony and Pro- tectorate 1931-37). 8 The undermining of the traditional model of reproduction and the formulation of a new model probably proceeded more rap- idly in urban than in rural areas, but urban and rural Luos were linked by visits back and forth (Ogot 1963; Parkin 1975; Goldenberg 1982). 9 Because cross- tabulations of women who \"want no more children\" by ethnic group, it may be that Luos in Nyanza were predominantly among those who, even at high parities, said they wanted more children. A decade later, the 1977/78 Kenya World Fertility Survey found that in Nyanza, of currently married fecund women aged 24-35 with six children, 8 percent wanted no more; and of those with eight children, 40 percent wanted no more. In Central Province (Kikuyuland) these figures were 22 percentand 69 percent, respectively, suggesting later changes in reproductive preferences among the Luos than among the Kikuyu that parallel the timing of the onset of fertility declines in the two groups (Kenya, Republic of 1980: A-365). 10 Molnos described her sampling, data collection, and coding procedures in great de- tail. At that time a relatively small proportion of children attended primary school, and an even smaller proportion continued to second- ary school. Molnos used a quota sample to try to include all types of schools within each area, but says that sometimes a particular kind of school did not exist (Molnos 1968: 42). While she believed her sample to be representative of children attending school, it obviously ruled out children from poor homes and children of \"'reactionary' families who resist modern edu- cation\" (ibid.: 43). The selection of specific schools is not described, but personal introduc- tions and convenience probably played a role in the choice. 11 Although it is likely that issues related to birth control were less salient to Molnos's students than to the older and married women in Heisel's survey, 73 percent of the studentswere aged 15 or older (Molnos 1968: 162). In 1977/78 the median female age at marriage nationally was 17.5, and 16.5 in Nyanza (Brass and Jolly 1993: 93); thus, the young women were approaching marriage, and surely had friends who were married. 12 Urban life appears to hold a persistent attraction: in the early 1990s, Alan Ferguson showed photographs of various locales in Kenya to teenagers, asking them where they would rather live. Overwhelmingly, the teen- agers chose not the pastoral pictures, but rather those of the slums of Nairobi (Ferguson, per- sonal communication). 13 The same respondents did not answer both questions. Molnos had four question- naires, distributed to each class in seating or- der. \"A couple who has three children...\" is on one questionnaire; \"A young married couple who decided not to have many chil- dren...\" is on another. Molnos reports that she analyzed the distribution of the four question- naires by sex and educational level and found no significant differences (Molnos 1968: 31). In addition, the wording differs: one question- naire defines a small family as three children, the other says \"decided not to have many,\" which could have evoked images of six or seven, as well as of three. 14 It is not clear whether \"medicines\" re- ferred to traditional or modern methods. There appears to have been less interest in birth spac- ing in Kenya than in some other sub-Saharan African countries (e.g., Malawi; see Zulu 1996); if Luos used traditional herbs for birth spac- ing, either there is a collective amnesia about them or respondents were unwilling to tell us. The main traditional method we heard about was postpartum abstinence. 15 Radel's elite sample included cabinet ministers and assistant ministers, MPs, senior civil servants, business executives, university professors, and media executives (Radel 1973: 164). 16 The postwar prosperity may have touched Nyanza less than some other prov- inces, and the Luos claim that they were dis- advantaged under the Kikuyu-favoring regime of Kenyatta and later under the Kalenjin-fa- voring regime of Moi (e.g., Ogot 1996). In an analysis of provincial-level economic statistics, Weinreb (2000) finds support for the Luos' per- ceptions. Increases in wage employment and752 MODELS OF REPRODUCTION IN NYANZA PROVINCE , K ENYA Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsper capita income were greater under Kenyatta (a Kikuyu) among the Kikuyu in Central Prov- ince and their political allies in Eastern Prov- ince than in the other provinces; and under Moi (a Kalenjin) these same indicators in- creased more in Rift Valley Province and West- ern Province, dominated respectively by the Kalenjin and their political allies the Luyha. See also Widner (1992) for the importance of eth- nicity in the political economy of Kenya. 17 The annual rate of inflation was 18 per- cent in 1990, 20 percent in 1991, 28 percent in 1992, and 46 percent in 1993 (Mwega, Mwangi, and Olewe-Ochilo 1994; Ndung'u 1997). 18 We went through all available volumes of the Weekly Review, Daily Nation, and The Stan- dard, with earlier dates more likely to be miss- ing. Based on the volumes to which we had access, there is an evident increase in articles on population and family planning after 1978, with particular activity in 1980-81 after the US Food and Drug Administration banned the injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera in the United States, and again after Kenya's Ses- sional Paper No. 4 of 1984 set out population policy guidelines. Interestingly, Moi's threatsto fire civil servants if they had too many chil- dren do not appear to have been taken seri- ously: I expected letters of outrage to follow in the Kenyan press, but found none. 19 I have no persuasive evidence that do- nor-funded activities had anywhere near the impact on reducing family size that might have been expected from the large sums spent on population programs. Perhaps the 116 agen- cies engaged in population activities in Nairobi in 1987 were simply spinning their wheels, or perhaps corruption siphoned off much of the money. But in considering the role of infor- mal debates about family size and family plan- ning in Nyanza in the mid-1990s, I think it likely that the activities of population agencies stimulated discussions in local networks that hastened the domestication of the deliberate control of fertility within marriage. 20 I am grateful to Eva Egensteiner for showing me the poster archives in the African collection of Northwestern University, for giv- ing me a set of her photos of the posters, and for her paper on \"Reproduction and mass me- dia\" (1997).21 English is learned in school, and Ki- swahili is learned on the streets. Of the women in our household survey in 1995-96, 42 per- cent reported that they spoke Kiswahili well enough to have a conversation, and 8 percent English. 22 Under-five mortality for Nyanza is es- timated to have been .328 in 1954, .221 in 1973, .168 in the decade preceding the 1993 KDHS, and .199 in 1998 (Brass and Jolly 1993: 37; Kenya, Republic of 1994: 86; 1998: 92). 23 This quotation illustrates a typical char- acteristic of responses to our questions about the advantages and disadvantages of small or large families: the speaker presents herself (or himself, in the male interviews) as favoring smaller numbers of children, while presenting opposing views as \"some people say.\" This marks a change from the Molnos survey. Al- though her respondents were students and thus reporting on what others said, it seems that by now respondents are distancing them- selves from negative views, perhaps because our survey was perceived to be promoting fam- ily planning; certainly, respondents expected that their community and they themselves might benefit from our research, e.g., that we might provide a new hospital or pay school fees (for a further discussion of this issue, see Miller, Zulu, and Watkins 2000). 24 The 1993 KDHS showed that 22 per- cent of currently married women in Nyanza Province were using family planning, and 11.3 percent in South Nyanza (Kenya, Republic of 1994: 43, 45). 25 It is difficult to evaluate quantitatively the impact of the domestication of the wazungu model on fertility behavior, although promis- ing research on social networks may eventu- ally permit us to describe this in and Watkins 2000. 26 Most demographic theorists pay little attention to outside actors, but the importance I give to the activities of representatives of the international population movement is consis- tent with the claims of family planning sup-SUSAN COTTS WATKINS 753 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsply-siders who publish in Studies in Family Plan- ning and International Family Planning Perspectives. 27 Some of the features of this history are not original. For example, the three Luo mod- els of reproduction bear a kinship to Ansley Coale's (1973) three preconditions for fertility decline (circumstances make fewer children more advantageous than many children, de- liberate control is licit, and means of control are available); and the shift from \"children are wealth\" to \"small families are progressive\" is not unlike the shift from \"quantity\" to \"qual- ity\" (Becker 1981). Similarly, the long process of change in models of reproduction fits well with John Caldwell's (1999) conclusion that children had become a net economic burden well before fertility declined in English-speak- ing countries. And the role I give to social in- teraction is consistent with the perspectives of others (e.g., Freedman and Takeshita 1969; and there are only a few general ex- planations for fertility decline, albeit many par- ticular versions of these explanations (e.g., van de Kaa 1996; Casterline 1999). On the other hand, some common analytic frameworks are difficult to reconcile with local Luo perceptions. The depiction of a sharp inflection point\u2014such as when the supply of children exceeds the demand (Easterlin and Crimmins 1985) or when the net flows of wealth reverse direc- tion (Caldwell 1976)\u2014is inconsistent with the uncertainty surrounding reproductive deci- sions in Nyanza and perhaps, in some cases, the absence of a decision (Fisher 2000). Theo- ries that emphasize mortality declines are not inconsistent with this history, but need to be reformulated so that they do not assume that the greater survival of children is actually per- ceived. Finally, the \"opportunity costs of women's time\" should not, in contexts such as rural Nyanza, be measured in terms of money. References Alderman, Harold et al. 2000.

Immediate causes are sought and generally centeraround issues of changing demand and supply. More specifically, the pro- ponents of the importance of changing demand stress the changing struc- tural conditions that alter the costs and benefits of children, while the \"sup-ply-siders\" give central importance to family planning programs which purportedly increase awareness and practice of contraception so that birth control becomes both desirable and possible. In recent years, these explanations have become enriched by another class of explanations that focus on the spread of positive attitudes toward controlled fertility and toward contraception. These attitudes may arisethrough means that are only tangentially related to changing economic en- vironments or to government population policy. In particular, they may develop through a process of diffusion of ideas from individuals already posi-tively inclined in this direction. Montgomery and Casterline (1998) provide a clear definition of such diffusion of attitudes in the context of social change: they refer to diffusion as \"a process in which individuals' decisions...areaffected by the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of others with whom they come in contact\" (p. 39). These \"others\" may be of different kinds\u2014peer groups, elites, family, friends, and so on\u2014and the contact may occur in a vari-ety of ways. Montgomery and Casterline (1998) postulate three principal mechanisms for these \"social effects\": social learning, social influence, and social norms. Several kinds of evidence support the validity of these diffusion theo- ries as partial explanations of fertility decline. 1 But most diffusion theories in demography have two features in common. First, they concentrate on762 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthe fact of diffusion itself, as an independent variable, amenable to inde- pendent manipulation and therefore a useful policy instrument. Second, they see diffusion as being concerned primarily with the spread of attitudes and beliefs regarding contraception and controlled fertility, with a conse-quent policy focus on family planning messages. In this article, we expand the concept and the relevance of diffusion on both these fronts. On the first point, the independence of the diffusionvariable, we suggest that diffusion does not take place in a vacuum: there are characteristics of both the \"diffusers\" and the \"diffusees\" (if one may coin these terms) that determine the nature, pace, and impact of the diffu-sion process. As Casterline (1999) writes, we are still far from understand- ing the conditions under which social effects can play a significant role. Sec- ond, one needs a more general definition of what is being diffused, if weare properly to understand the role of diffusion in fertility change. Our con- tention is that there is more to be learned from an understanding of the forces that promote the diffusion of a new ideology or worldview than fromfocusing on the ways in which specific attitudes to contraception are spread. To illustrate these two propositions, we examine the experience of the geographic area we call Greater Bengal. This is the Bengali-speaking regionencompassed by the country of Bangladesh and the state of West Bengal in India. The demographic transition of Bangladesh is of course one of the most intensely studied transitions in the contemporary world. Its fertilitydecline\u2014both in terms of the onset and the pace\u2014has seemed to defy stan- dard explanations except if formulated in often convoluted ways, and there is a large literature trying to understand how fertility has fallen so rapidlyin a country that apparently meets few of the standard preconditions for fertility decline: significant socioeconomic progress; major falls in mortal- ity; substantial changes in the status of women. Moreover, Bangladesh is apredominantly Muslim country, and the conventional understanding is that Islam is a conservative religion with especially conservative views on mat- ters of abortion and contraception. Given all this, it is not surprising thatthe literature has contained so much debate on whether the fertility de- cline is driven primarily by social change (e.g., Caldwell et al. 1999), the family planning program (e.g., Cleland et al. 1994), a rise in the status ofwomen (e.g., Schuller and Hashemi 1994), coercion (e.g., Hartmann 1995), or a change in the nature and a possible intensification of poverty (e.g., Adnan 1998). But note that all these debates frame the argument in imme diate cause- and-effect terms and have little interest, except in a very short-term sense, in the historical processes that may have led to their operation. Indeed, as Greenhalgh (1995) complains, ahistorical approaches are a striking feature of analyses of reproductive change in the developing world. West Bengal, in contrast, has not excited the demographic imagina- tion. It occupies an ambiguous geographical position in the popular north-south analytic dichotomy in studies of India, and it does not display theALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 763 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsstarkly extreme demographic regimes of, say, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. West Bengal is nevertheless interesting demographically. Calcutta, the capital of the state, began its fertility decline much earlier than the rest of India ac- cording to estimates by Mari Bhat (1996). Today, fertility levels in WestBengal are well below the national average for the country (see Table 1), and its levels of use of temporary methods of contraception, according to the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS), are the highest (Interna-tional Institute for Population Studies 1995a). These high levels of use of temporary methods are at least partly the result of unusually high levels of use of traditional methods of contraception. While one could argue thattraditional methods do not represent very effective contraceptive use, a counter-argument could be made that they nevertheless indicate intentions to delay or space births. These intentions are also indicated by NFHS resultswhich find that West Bengal has the highest level of contraceptive use among women with no living children (20 percent, as compared to 4 percent for all-India) and that, except for Delhi and Tripura, West Bengal has the low-est proportion of women for whom sterilization is the first method of con- traception ever used. In addition, while Muslims throughout India have lower levels of con- traceptive use than Hindus, the Muslims of West Bengal have the highest level of contraceptive use (43 percent) in the country (the all-India average is 28 percent)\u2014higher even than that of the Muslims of Kerala (38 per-cent). In other words, the Muslims of West Bengal are clearly different from their coreligionists in other parts of the country (on all this, see Ramesh, Gulati, and Retherford 1996). The most interesting demographic feature of West Bengal is that these differences from all-India averages exist despite a state government that has been quite indifferent to population policy: West Bengal has never had thekind of aggressive or even efficient family planning campaign or program that many other parts of India have embraced at various times.

In this article we rely on some of the resultant literature to support our contention that history and culture can combine to create an en-vironment that is more conducive to social change in some situations than in others, a conduciveness that can lead to significant reproductive change even in the absence of changes in the standard demand and supply factors associ-ated with reproductive control. The Bengali language is a crucial element in the spread of such conduciveness, and we suggest that a proper understand- ing of the fertility decline in Bangladesh therefore requires a joint study ofBangladesh and West Bengal. Such a study would probably yield lessons on fertility change in West Bengal as well, but we do not have a sufficient record of the details of fertility change in West Bengal from which to distill such les-sons. We thus use other markers of social change in West Bengal: its unique political situation (it is the only part of the world with a large population that has had an unbroken record of almost a quarter-century of elected Communist Party rule) and its remarkable success in fostering agrarian change in general and the adoption of agricultural innovations in particular. In our formulation, these markers of social change are analogous to the social change implied byfertility decline in Bangladesh. All these changes are in turn a concomitant of the diffusion of an ideology of openness to change and to innovative behavior that we posit is an important conditioning factor for fertility decline. Our central message is that the two Bengals (Bangladesh and West Bengal) have, for a combination of historical, cultural, and political rea- sons, long had a willingness to change that often ran counter to their socio-economic circumstances. This willingness to change began with the \"elites\" but spread to the general population for these same reasons. We hypoth- esize that this unique combination of historical, cultural, and political fac-tors in Greater Bengal has resulted in a unique form of Bengali \"modern- ism\" and Bengali nationalism. In turn, these phenomena have facilitated the transition to what may be called a secular society that is somewhat atodds with the general socioeconomic development of the region. As the literature on the European fertility transition illustrates, such a secular, \"lib- eral\" outlook can facilitate an openness to change and innovation whenthe opportunities for such change or innovation arise (e.g., Lesthaeghe and Wilson 1986). In other words, it is quite possible that the program and de- velopment factors that inform part of the debate on the determinants offertility change in Bangladesh would not have had similar effects in an- other environment. Indeed, one could also suggest that the very appearance of such fac- tors on the Bengal scene is an outcome of the modernization just described. That is, policymakers as well as politicians have themselves been more re- ceptive to the idea of radical programs. In this context an analogy may bedrawn between the programs of the Communist Party that has ruled WestALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 765 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsBengal and the programs of the government and the nongovernmental or- ganizations that dominate the policy scene in Bangladesh. As for Bengali nationalism, it has helped to do two things. First, it has increased the interaction between the two Bengals, and, given the politicaland religious divide between the two regions, it has thus exposed each re- gion to a wider world of ideas and behaviors than would have been pos- sible had the language-based interaction been confined within political bor-ders. Second, within each region, it has increased the interaction between the elites and the general population in a way that is less common in areas where socioeconomic differences are not attenuated by a similarly strongsense of cultural identity. It is therefore not surprising that governmental and nongovernmental programs have relied heavily on mass recruitment and have developed urban-rural links in a way that is less common in otherparts of South Asia. In the following sections, we elaborate on these issues. We first justify our concentration on the elites of Bengali society. We then describe the riseof Bengali modernism and Bengali nationalism among the elites in the two Bengals up to as well as after the 1947 partition of the subcontinent. The discussion relates the rise of a Westernized, but nevertheless nationalisticmiddle class in Bengal to the early and intense experience of colonialism combined with some elements of its own past. We then consider some of the ways in which the strong sense of Bengali identity in the two Bengalshas facilitated a continuous interaction between the elites of the two re- gions, so that they have strengthened and expanded the secular, liberal dis- course within each region. We also examine some of the ways in which astrong language identity has fostered the diffusion of ideas between the elites and the larger population within each region. That is, we look at some of the implications of Bengali modernism and Bengali nationalism for the in-clination and the ability of the elites to spread these new ideologies across socioeconomic boundaries within the two regions. 2 This permeability, we claim, must be a part of the explanation for the highly successful spread of two kindsof innovations\u2014agrarian change in West Bengal and contraceptive use in Bang- ladesh\u2014that have attracted much academic attention in recent years. Finally, we speculate on some of the larger implications of our analysis. The elites and reproductive change In this article we look at the special position historically of the elites of the two Bengals.3 The theoretical justification for this focus comes from the dif- fusion literature in sociology. In particular, we draw upon the part of thisliterature that discusses the notion of the most effective agents of social change. The reference here is to the diffusion of a new way of thinking, a new ideology, and not merely to allaying fears about new forms of behav-ior and the adoption of physical innovations (such as the adoption of new766 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsagricultural technology) in particular. The general conclusion from this dis- cussion seems to be that in the latter case, the experience of those who face similar environments of risk has much to offer. But in introducing one to and legitimizing a new worldview, accepted figures of authority have moreinfluence than friends and neighbors (on this, see also Granovetter 1973; Liu and Duff 1972; Basu and Sundar 1988). But the strength of influence exerted by these accepted figures of au- thority depends in turn on two factors: their own openness and commit- ment to change and innovations and their ability to transmit these attributes to the general population. Continuing to draw on the diffusion literature,one may presume that the modernization of the elites depends on the het- erogeneity of the world of ideas and experiences that they are exposed to. We contend that such heterogeneous exposure is facilitated by two thingsin Bengal: an early history of exposure to the larger world and the strong sense of language identity that links the elites on both sides of the political border and thus opens up to them a larger world of thought, policy, andprograms than if their sources of such information had been limited to their own countrymen. In turn, this pervasive sense of language identity makes it easier for them to transmit these new modes of thought to the generalpopulation than is the case in populations in which the gulf between elites and \"masses\" is unbridgeably dominated by the socioeconomic differences between the two groups. In our case, the language identity is able to over-come these other differences to some extent and therefore facilitate the mass mobilization that heralds mass social change. In the specific study of reproductive change, the focus on the elites is also empirically justified. First, it seems to be justified by the literature on historical as well as contemporary fertility transitions that suggests that the most- advantaged socioeconomic groups in a region are usually the first to adopt con-trolled fertility; they are what Livi-Bacci (1986) calls the \"forerunners of fertil- ity decline.\" Indeed, the demographic literature suggests that it is often this change in behavior among the elites that diffuses into the general populationthrough what Cleland and Wilson (1987) call \"social imitation.\" We contend that the elites of Bengal are and were a privileged group in this respect. Their potential for facilitating the spread of fertility declinethrough their own behavior in this area seems to have been greater than for comparable groups elsewhere. To begin with, it is striking that as early as the 1970s the city of Calcutta (the population of which may be treated asthe geographical elite of the greater Bengal region) had the lowest fertility in India. According to the estimates of Mari Bhat (1996), in 1974-80 the total fertility rate in Calcutta was 2.0, lower even than in Trivandrum (witha TFR of 2.5 at this time), the capital of the current low-fertility outlier among Indian states, Kerala. It would of course have been helpful to have these data broken down by some indicator of social class, since it is the elites of greater Bengal thatALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 767 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsare of concern here. The scattered evidence on this subject supports the assumption that the decline in elite fertility in Bengal began earlier and continues to be sharper than in other parts of India. A survey in three so- cioeconomically distinct parts of the city of Calcutta in 1947-49 found that,in the locality in which the population was largely upper-class and edu- cated, as many as 38 percent of married women reported having used some form of birth control, this figure being as high as 18 percent even for womenaged 40-44 at the time of the survey. That is, in this part of the city, signifi- cant levels of contraceptive use seem to have existed as far back as the 1930s and 1940s (Chandrasekaran and George 1962). More contemporary data, from the National Family Health Survey for example, suggest strongly that the elites (broadly measured here as women who have completed at least a high school education 4) of West Bengal to- day are more modern in their fertility behavior than the elites of the rest of India, including Kerala (although fertility levels in Kerala vary less by class). Table 2 lays out some statewise differentials in elite fertility in India; it isclear that in this group West Bengal leads the rest of the country, a lead that we suggest has historical roots. Even if one does not subscribe to diffusion theories of reproductive change, the attitudes and values of the elites remain a focus of interest be- cause these groups carry the greatest potential for social change in general and fertility change in particular. This potential derives from their ability to TABLE 2 Indicators of elite fertility in India: Selected states, 1990-92 Percent of current users of TFR of currently married contraception among womenwomen with a high school with a high school or higher State or higher educationaeducationb All-India 2.15 55 West Bengal 1.50 49 aVarious volumes of International Institute for Population Studies, National Family Health Survey 1992-93 , Bombay: IIPS, 1995. bRamesh, Gulati, and Retherford 1996.768 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsmold popular opinions and attitudes, including some of the rising material aspirations that may contribute to falling fertility (e.g., Casterline 1999; Sathar and Casterline 1998), and to legitimize new forms of behavior (in- cluding contraceptive practice). It also derives from their control of the poli-cies and programs that can be catalysts of change in poor societies. In other words, even a change in the structural circumstances of people\u2014in the fer- tility context, a change in the determinants of demand\u2014requires some formof policy, even if the policy is one of nonintervention. In particular, a society's elites are implicated in the growing literature on the role of governance in fertility declines (e.g., McNicoll 1997). Whileit is commonplace to discuss the role of family planning programs or other policies in reproductive change, this is not the same thing as exploring the macrolevel political economy of reproductive change. 5 A political economy perspective would need to endogenize government, would need to try (as discussed by Dixit 1996; Basu 2000) to understand the constraints and in- fluences on the formulators and implementers of policy. What we seek todo here therefore is to place the elites of a society in their historical and cultural context, so that their actions themselves are as much to be explained as the impact of their actions. 6 Barkat-e-Khuda et al. (1996) take one step toward endogenizing the relevant characteristics of Bangladeshi elites. They locate these elites (com- posed mainly of senior bureaucrats, in their analysis) in the larger postcolonialculture that was heavily informed by Malthusian arguments and by arguments for political intervention in public affairs. But they do not carry their endogenizing far enough. In particular, they do not grapple with elite differ- entials within South Asia. Given the common colonial history of the region and common (and, subsequent to 1971, similar) structures of elite training and formation in East and West Pakistan, one needs to explain how theelites of Bangladesh have turned out to be so much better able to foster social change. By focusing on neo-Malthusianism, these authors also do not depict the elites of Bangladesh as agents of social change in general, concen-trating rather on more narrowly defined population policies and family plan- ning programs\u2014factors that in our framework are but manifestations of a greater propensity to generate overall social change. We turn now to the history of theBengali-speaking world of which Bangladesh is a part. History, culture, and the growth of elite modernism in the two Bengals First we specify what we mean by Bengali modernism. While modernism is often used as a synonym for Westernization,7 that use still begs the ques- tion of what one means by Westernization. The term may refer to purely structural processes, such as changes in modes of production, or to qualita-ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 769 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentstive changes in worldviews and attitudes. On the latter, one may in turn think of Westernizaton as an adoption of Western forms of behavior and preferences. For example, in many parts of the developing world, Western- ization has included (some would say, consisted solely of) the wholesaleadoption of popular Western (or, increasingly, North American) culture. At a more abstruse level of imitation, Westernization would include an appre- ciation of and achievement of excellence in Western forms of civilization,in art or classical music for instance. This form of imitation is most evident in countries of the Far East and in some parts of the Middle East. Alternatively, one may see Westernization as the adoption of Western modes of thought without reference to the ultimate preferences and be- haviors in which these thought processes result. The Bengal experience sug- gests a form of Westernization that need not go hand in hand with the ob-vious adoption of Western modes of behavior. Instead, it involves the adoption of a secular philosophy that defines an approach to thought and behavior rather than the thought or behavior itself. In the present context,this secularism is manifested in two ways: in a separation of the religious and the political spheres of life, and in a willingness to question the old ways and to experiment with new forms of behavior even if these new modesare often merely altered versions of the old rather than imports originating from and developed in the West. It is this willingness to question, to debate things that have long been taken for granted, that probably defines the essence of modernism in our context. This willingness can come through formal education, but it can also arise from other shocks to the system\u2014wars, for example. 8 The moral acceptance of the idea of specific forms of contraception or even of fertility control in general is, in this formulation, but one manifestation of the will- ingness to consider alternatives. As Lesthaeghe (1983) discusses with refer-ence to the European experience, this kind of moral acceptability that ac- companied the processes of secularization must have been an important determinant of differentials in the pace of fertility decline that could not beexplained solely by changing structural factors. Secularization helped to bring the idea of fertility control, in the familiar words of Coale (1973), \"within the calculus of conscious choice.\" 9 As discussed below, it is this kind of secu- larization that took hold as Bengal modernized and that continues today in an allegiance to free thought and ideological radicalism that at times seems curiously misplaced. A combination of circumstances, including the historical accident of being the first major outpost of the British Empire in undivided India, led to a unique brand of \"nationalist modernization\" in Bengal, a moderniza-tion that sought to combine traditional forms of learning and culture with modern perspectives gleaned from Western styles of education and politicization of the elites. The result was what has been called the Bengal re-770 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsnaissance in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, leading to the some- what exaggerated statement by the social reformer Gopal Krishna Gokhale that \"what Bengal thinks today, the rest of India thinks tomorrow.\" Calcutta, the current capital of the Indian state of West Bengal, was the first administrative as well as economic capital of colonial India\u2014serv- ing as the administrative capital of the East India Company from 1757 to 1858 and then of the Indian part of the British Empire from 1858 to 1911.10 Thus, it is not surprising that it was also the first site for the spread of mod- ern knowledge and the spread of an ideology of modernization. This spread is best appreciated by mention of the growth of education and of the printmedia in Bengal in the nineteenth century. 11 To summarize briefly, modern education made its first appearance on the Indian subcontinent in Bengal; its subsequent growth, too, was fasterin this part of the region. For example, in 1901-02, there were 44 colleges (government and private) in Bengal, compared with 40 in Madras, 26 in the United Provinces, and 10 in Bombay. By 1918, Calcutta University, with27,000 students, was the largest university in the world. While much of this new education was elitist, restricted to the arts and humanities, and concerned with producing junior government officialsto run the day-to-day business of the colonial government, 12 it did have the less clearly anticipated effect of producing a class of thinkers who used their education to do more than simply teach the next generation of civil ser-vants or serve the government themselves. Bengal's educated elites were also distinct in not being almost exclu- sively Brahmin by caste. Indeed, they were not upper caste(see Wolpert 1994; Spear 1990; Marshall 1987)\u2014a factor that must have contributed to their greater enthusiasm for the new ideas that modern edu- cation encouraged. In Madras, on the other hand, higher education wasopen almost exclusively only to the Brahmin or otherwise conservative elites, their conservatism in fact being strengthened by perceived threats to their privileged status by a more egalitarian system of education. (For a descrip-tion of some of the debates on this subject in Madras Presidency, see Frykenberg 1986.) In Bombay Presidency similarly, the Marathi-speaking beneficiaries of the new higher education were almost exclusively Brah-min; the non-Marathi-speaking beneficiaries belonged almost entirely to an urban commercial middle class; and all groups came from backgrounds that were neither economically powerful nor rurally influential (Gumperz 1974). 13 The lessons learned under this new form of modern education in Ben- gal were of course subversively used to encourage an anticolonial stance;14 but this education also provided the impetus for the development of an intellectual tradition that was conscious of the need for change in and re- form of many aspects of Bengali life. What was usually advocated was a reappraisal of Bengal's own past to attune it more to indigenous realities,and not necessarily a rejection of this past. 15ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 771 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of ContentsThe growth of this tradition is best embodied in the formation of sev- eral literary and learned societies (see Sanyal 1980 for a compendium of the large number of such groups in the nineteenth century) such as the Society for the Acquisition of General Knowledge, founded in 1838, andthe Bengal Social Science Association, established in 1867, as well as the formation and high visibility of more radical groups such as the Young Bengal organization and the much more sustained and influential Brahmo Samaj.All these organizations and associations and key individuals actively dis- cussed and debated many of the venerable traditions of India. Questions related to women, caste, education, and work all became legitimate issuesof inquiry and redefinition. While this debate did not often lead to action or led to modest action at best, it did legitimize debate and dissent concerning such matters, and it served to move many of these questions from the do-mestic to the public domain (T. Sarkar 1997). The rapid growth of the print media also contributed to the general air of dissent, questioning, and introspection of this period. According to The Descriptive Catalogue of Bengali Works , published by the Irish missionary James Long in 1855 (cited in Roy 1995), at least 1,400 Bengali books and pam- phlets had been printed during the first 50 years of the nineteenth century.While many of these books were mythological or fictional (the latter too frequently of an \"amatory\" nature according to the local authorities), there was an increasing presence (especially after 1850) of biographies, transla-tions of English classics, and scientific discourses (Roy 1995). To give just two examples relevant in the present context, in 1878 Anandachandra Mitra published an Introduction to the Science of Politics , which grappled with many of the problems of governance that enter the current literature on the role of governance and civil society in demographic change (Chatterjee 1995). And Satishchandra Chakraborty's Character Formation of Children , published in 1912, deeply influenced the debate on the changing nature of the fam- ily, the correct upbringing of the model child, and the central role of the mother in this endeavor (Bose 1995). To the demographer, it may appear odd that most of these debates in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth related to matters of social and personal reform, with much less interest in larger economicforces as they impinged on society. 16 Thus there was, for example, little public interest in the winds of Malthusianism that earlier swept across Europe and later, albeit more slowly, across the Indian subcontinent. But this did notmean that population-related matters were not part of the intellectual and moral agenda of the elites. In fact, there was much public discussion on the new roles of women and the place of childbearing in these new roles. Onesalient caveat is called for, however. The new roles envisioned for women did not include independence from men; instead the intent was to educate and develop a new breed of wives and mothers who were better compan-ions to their husbands and better mothers to a new generation of disci-772 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsplined and healthy children. Both these abilities were naturally hampered by untrammeled childbearing, and there was much attempt, especially in the rapidly multiplying women's magazines and medical and marriage manu- als, to teach women how to control their fertility. It is here of incidental interest that most of this birth control informa- tion was wrong. For example, the most fertile period was routinely described as stretching from a few days before to a few days after (as well as includingthe duration of) the menstrual period. Intercourse was thus to be avoided during this time if a pregnancy was to be prevented (Borthwick 1984). What is significant, though, is that most of the reproductive advice was related tomeans of preventing rather than establishing a pregnancy; that is, this ad- vice was addressing the contraceptive needs of women. Prolonged breast- feeding was also commonly promoted as an effective contraceptive, inde- pendently of its value for the child. Additionally, there was a burgeoning of information on abortion, addressed not only to women socially proscribed from childbearing (such as prostitutes and widows), but also to marriedwomen. Guha (1996), for example, discusses a collection of folk remedies to induce abortion that was set to verse and easily available to married women in the early twentieth century. That abortion itself was frequently attempted was recorded by several medical practitioners from as early as the mid-nineteenth century. Indeed, the classic work on medical jurisprudence (N. Chevers, A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for Bengal and the North-Western Provinces , Calcutta, 1856; cited in Guha 1996), which was intended to \"contribute to the HISTORY OF CRIME IN INDIA,\" referred to the \"procuration of abortions\" as perti- nacious sensualists.\" from her massive survey of maternal mortality in Calcutta in 1936, Dr. Margaret I. Neal-Edwards reported that abortion wascommon in Bengal \"among all classes, communities and ages of women, married and single\" (cited in Guha 1996). Indeed by this time, abortion in Calcutta was publicly enough available for women to come seeking it fromas far away as Delhi (interview with Roy Edward King Nissen, born 1905, in the series Memories of the British in India, Oral Archives at the India Office, London, cited in Guha 1996). However, it should be added, it was the Hindu intelligentsia of Bengal that dominated the beginning of this growth in modern education and dis- course. 17 For example, in 1901 Hindus made up 94 percent of all students in liberal arts colleges, 96 percent in professional colleges, and 88 percent in high schools (Murshid 1995). Among Muslims, the Bengal elites were much less likely to owe allegiance to Bengal or to Bengali, and any socialand political discourses they engaged in were more likely to be conducted in Persian or Urdu. (For a detailed discussion of religious differences in trends in and attitudes toward education, see Ahmed 1996.) But once the Muslimintelligentsia began to view an English-language education more favorably,ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 773 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsa class of Bengali Muslim intellectuals soon developed that was committed to fostering social change in their community.18 Moreover, while the Muslim Bengali intelligentsia was slower to grow than its Hindu counterpart, it is also true that Bengali Muslim culture andsociety in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were and are very differ- ent from the societies and cultures of other Islamic regions. Ideas derived from Islamic history and thought were tempered by the local Bengali mi-lieu and by the strong Sufi underpinnings of Islam in Bengal (e.g., Haq 1975; Akter Banu 1992; Ahmed 1996; Roy 1983). As Murshid (1995) discusses in some detail, this fact led to a persistent tension between the religious andsecular perceptions of the Muslim intelligentsia in colonial Bengal. For ex- ample, the \"Faith Movement\" of the traditionalists of the 1920s was counter- balanced by the \"Movement for the Emancipation of the Intellect,\" whichargued vociferously for the exercise of personal freedom and the right to be selective in allegiance to the various faces of Islam. At least partly, this secular temperament was an outcome of or ran parallel to similar trends in BengaliHindu secularism, the leaders in the two groups having ties with one an- other (Murshid 1995). This intellectual tradition continued after the partition of India in 1947, with a consequent massive growth in the education and modernization of a new Bengali Muslim elite, drawn largely from the educated, upwardly mo- bile middle- ashraf (aristocracy). The teachers and students of Dhaka Uni- versity were important agents of change in this regard and came to embody the search for a secular Bengali identity that reexamined many of the sup- posedly Islamic (and hence by extrapolation non-Bengali) underpinningsof Pakistan within its post-1947 borders. For example, the journal New Val- ues, founded in 1949 by Sarwar Murshid, a teacher in the English depart- ment of the university, aimed to \"direct a searching inquiry into the rootsof our beliefs and attitudes and help remove some of the obstacles to intel- ligent action as a means to good life\" (vol. 1, no. 1, 1949). The journal en- couraged debate on all matters, with its own leaning being in the directionof a rational and secular society: \"A secular attitude to cultural values will, in our context, keep culture from egocentricity and exclusion and make it absorptive of outside in fluences\" (editorial in vol. 2, no. 1, 1950). In the con- text of religion, it emphasized adherence to the spirit of Islam rather than to the letter of Islamic law. Several other, individually small pieces of information create a picture of growing (though fluctuating) secularism and modernization among the Bengali Muslims of East Pakistan and then Bangladesh, a picture at odds with the more conservative Islam of the former West Pakistan and the MiddleEast, for example. Much of this had historical roots of course. Quite apart from the impact of education and general modernization was the fact that West Pakistan was dominated by the ashraf ideology, which accorded high status to ethnic descent and to more conservative values. The East Pakistan774 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsintelligentsia, on the other hand, was largely sprung from the ranks: it had strong rural roots and thus was more sympathetic to the syncretic culture of rural Bengal than to the purely Muslim culture of the ashraf . It is particularly significant that while political regimes in Bangladesh have played the Muslim card for political purposes, they have on the whole been half-hearted about the Islamization of the country. For example, while the secularism \"pillar\" was removed from the 1972 Constitution (to be re-placed with \"in the name of Allah, the merciful and the beneficient\" 19) and Islam is now officially the state religion, the government has thus far stopped short of declaring Bangladesh to be an Islamic state. And even the declara-tion of Islam as the state religion does not seem to have prevented any of the political parties in power from actively promoting various \"modern\" programs for social change\u2014in girls' education, women's employment, andfamily planning, to name only some. In any case, it appears that these con- stitutional changes were never derived from public demand; they were in- stead an attempt by individual leaders like Ziaur Rahman to legitimize theirown standing (Akter Banu 1992). Indeed, all accounts indicate that the local population in Bangladesh continues to practice a kind of \"religious secularism,\" in that individual re-ligiosity coexists with non-communalism (called dharma-nirapeksata in Bengali and as \"neutrality in religion\": see Siddique 1999; Akter Banu 1992) in interpersonal relations. This neutrality is also seen inthe large proportions of individuals who believe that individual religiosity is compatible with a secular political system (see, e.g., the survey results in Akter Banu 1992) and in the fact that the religious organization with thelargest public following is not a political party such as Jama'at-I-Islami but an apolitical one such as Tabligbad, which emphasizes personal but not public allegiance to Islam (Sikand 1999). The quantitative information that exists on this subject yields more interesting information. In an extensive rural and urban survey of religious attitudes, Akter Banu (1992) found that the large majority of respondentsfelt that the satisfaction they got from work was related to the physical needs it could satisfy and to the sense of personal achievement it conferred rather than to its being a religious obligation. Similarly, while seeking advice or helpon day-to-day matters, both rural and urban Bangladeshis were much more likely to report turning to peers or kin or to community leaders rather than to the local mullahs. And finally, the large majority were in favor of political lead-ers who were personally religious but secular in their political ideology. The growth of a Bengali language identity The colonial history of undivided Bengal is an important part of any at-tempt to understand Bengali modernism and Bengali nationalism, both ofwhich survived the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 and the subse-ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 775 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsquent formation of the state of Bangladesh in 1971. In this section we sum- marize this history and its implications for language nationalism. The distinguishing feature of Bengali language identity is that it is the primary form of identity of speakers of the language, usually supersedingother forms of group allegiance. 20 This distinction is important, for while a common language may increase the ease of communication between two groups, this ease may not translate into greater discourse if other, non-lan-guage-related barriers to communication\u2014such as religion or nationality\u2014 are paramount. Here the Bengal situation is different because it is not just a common language we are talking about. A strong sense of language iden-tity distinguishes the Bengali-speaking populations of the world, an iden- tity that at most normal times transcends a national or even a religious iden- tity. Thus the Bengali in West Bengal is often seen by his compatriots inother parts of the country as being a Bengali first and an Indian next, 21 while the Bangladeshi citizen has traditionally caused concern in the larger Muslim world for seeing himself as a Bengali first and a Muslim next. How and when did this strong sense of language identity emerge? His- torically, one needs to look at this question in two parts. The first is the development of Bengali identity in the undivided Bengal of colonial times;the second is the emergence of Bengali nationalism in East Pakistan that culminated in the creation and consequent sustenance of Bangladesh. Language identity in greater Bengal and later West Bengal Although the Bengali language itself has a long history (see Sen 1960), a conscious Bengali identity seems to have developed in the region only dur- ing colonialism and, many historians suggest, as a response to the colonial experience. We may note two strands of influence in the literature. Bothinfluences were more powerful in their effect in Bengal than in other parts of colonial India because Calcutta was the seat of colonial power up to 1911, at which time the administrative and political capital shifted to Delhi. First, the development of a self-identity was an inevitable result of the Western-style education that the bhadralok 22 in Bengal took to so naturally. While this education led to the kind of modernization of attitudes and val-ues discussed in the last section, it also soon led to the adoption of political ideas of self-government and freedom from foreign rule that this liberal edu- cation emphasized. Second, notions of self-identity and self-pride were developed as a di- rect reaction to the colonial representation of their subjects as uncivilized (that is, needing to be ruled), weak, effete, and deceitful. (All of these ad-jectives were used by colonial authorities at one time or another to define the Bengali in particular and the Indian subject in general; a vast literature on this subject and references to this literature can be found in, e.g., Moorhouse776 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table This representation naturally led not only to an opposition to the ruling colonial power but also to a reexamination and redefinition of the self. While these anticolonial attempts to define a new self focused broadly on a nationalism that was framed in terms of Indianness (and, frequently, Hinduness; see, e.g., Chowdhury 1998; Chatterji 1994), at a more local and immediate level it was expressed as a resurgence of Bengali identity. TheBengali language was of course the primary marker of such an identity, and allegiance to the Bengali language was emphasized in early attempts to mobilize anti-British sentiments. 23 Bengali nationalism and (perhaps more importantly) the advent of printing also led to such a phenomenal growth in publishing in Bengali (as discussed above) that it became progressively easier to emphasize Bengali identity. This invigorated identity was strong enough to continue to exist as a distinct entity after independence; it derived continuing strength from, and in turn led to the intellectual and cultural development of the Bengali re-gion, or, more accurately, Calcutta. This began with a thriving economy but was not fazed by the subsequently slow economic progress made by the region. As Moorhouse (1971) describes it, \"there are far more poets in thiscity [Calcutta] than there are novelists in Dublin\" (p. 190), and \"more pub- lishers in Calcutta, it is said, than in all the rest of India\" (p. 191). This is of course a highly stylized picture. It is also a picture that in recent times (and similarly to the situation described for contemporary Bang- ladesh below) is threatened and, more importantly, perceived to be seriously threatened, by global, national, and local \"non-Bengali\" forces that preventthe nurturing of the Bengali language in West Bengal. The very recent at- tempts to redress this perceived neglect by such symbolic gestures as changing the names of Calcutta and West Bengal to more Bengali versions, as well asmore substantive measures such as the establishment of a language com- mittee to strengthen the role of Bengali in education and culture, can, how- ever, also be read as indicators of the continuing importance and strengthof the Bengali identity. This is different from the sons-of-the-soil move- ments that fight for local rights in other parts of India: here language primacy is at stake, rather than economic or administrative rights for the locals. Language identity in Bangladesh The birth of Bangladesh was itself an outcome of a growing Bengali or\"Bangla\" identity, distinct from the larger Muslim identity that pitched EastBengal into Pakistan in the 1947 partition of the Indian subcontinent. The force of the language identity is best exemplified by the Language Move- ment, which began soon after 1947 to resist the imposition of Urdu as theofficial language of the erstwhile Pakistan. 24 The Language Movement be-ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 777 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentscame indelibly imprinted in Bangladeshi mass consciousness after the vio- lence of 21 February 1952 (21 February being celebrated ever since as Lan- guage Martyrs' Day)25 and eventually led to the establishment of Bengali as the official language of independent Bangladesh not just in conducting theaffairs of government but also as the medium of instruction in education and the vehicle of development of a Bangladeshi culture. Indeed, this as- sertion of a Bengali identity facilitated the aforementioned development ofsecularism among the Bangladeshi intelligentsia. That Bangladeshi culture is more Bengali than Islamic is evident in the many symbols of Bengaliness that have their origins in Hinduism ratherthan in Islam, but are seen today as being neither Hindu nor Muslim, merely Bengali (on this \"syncretic\" Islam of Bangladesh, see Roy 1983; Gardner 1998). The emphasis in matters of names, dress, music, the arts, and litera-ture is often on Bengali rather than Muslim roots, although a modest move- ment that seeks to reemphasize the Islamic element in Bangladeshi culture has long existed and has been growing recently. Language identity and the diffusion of modernization This article gives importance to language identity as an encourager of com- munication and to a common language as a facilitator of communication. We discuss two aspects of this encouraging and facilitating role of language. The first is that language, as a primary marker of self-identification, can encourage links between groups that are otherwise disparate. We hy- pothesize that the larger and more diverse the network within which a lan- guage is shared, the greater its potential to facilitate changes in norms andbehavior. On this count, the Bengali language is somewhat distinct: it is shared by groups that do not share political or religious boundaries, and it is associated in the minds of its speakers with a sense of identity that tendsto supersede other forms of group identity. As we discuss below, this has led to a continuous intellectual and sociocultural interaction between West Bengal and Bangladesh at several levels, direct and indirect. This interac-tion may have overcome some of the conventional barriers to fertility de- cline because it has led to a greater exposure to new ideas and a greater openness to change in the two regions. All this has been helped by histori-cal factors that gave the Bengal region a head start in modern education and in intellectual discourses that informed the worldviews of the elites. These worldviews are now being pressed into service to enable more rapidsocial change than has occurred in those parts of South Asia with a shorter history of intellectual and cultural exposure to the wider world. Second, the Bengali identity has greatly facilitated a diffusion of new ideas and attitudes from the elites to the general population within each778 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsregion. There is of course a third category of diffusion that is facilitated and encouraged by a common language and a strong language identity. This is the direct diffusion of ideas and knowledge between the general popula- tions of West Bengal and Bangladesh, not mediated through the elites. (Thiskind of diffusion is the subject of a spatial analysis in Amin, Basu, and Stephenson 2000.) Diffusion across political boundaries One of the two central hypotheses of this article is that the elites' own atti-tudes toward change in Bengal have been reinforced by the strong sense of Bengali identity that links them across political borders and thus increasesthe heterogeneity of their networks of interaction. There is much empirical evidence (albeit all qualitative) for this sustained and intense interaction between the elites of the two Bengals. Historically, of course, large-scale movements of the Bengali elites took place across political borders during and soon after the creation of Pakistan and then Bangladesh. On both sides they came with novel ideas and newattitudes, and it seems to be acknowledged that these cross-border move- ments brought with them a breath of fresh air. This migration-induced ex- posure to the winds of change has been considered particularly relevant forwomen's position in the two Bengals. For example, the writer and poet Nabaneeta Dev Sen has described great benefits for women's autonomy and attitudes in West Bengal of having educated Hindu women from East Ben-gal move there after 1947. Having left their security and possessions be- hind, these East Bengal women were perforce more bold and liberated than their native counterparts and provided many role models for educated WestBengal women. On the other side, many of the Muslim women who moved from West Bengal to East Bengal came with what one interview respon- dent in Bangladesh called their \"Calcutta education\" and \"Calcutta progres-siveness,\" which they soon put to use to stimulate social change for women in East Pakistan. 26 Today, at a political level, this cross-border interaction tends to fluctu- ate in intensity and warmth; there is often hostility to and suspicion of one another's motives. But at intellectual, cultural, and emotional levels, the two Bengals continue to share a long history of generally positive interac-tions. This is reflected in a constant coming and going of individuals be- tween the two regions, a disproportionate amount of space being given to one another in newspapers and magazines, and a frequent collaboration inthe production of art and in other cultural activities. 27 The binding force of \"Bengaliness\" is particularly evident in the diasporic populations of West Bengal and Bangladesh. Most parts of the world that havea significant resident South Asian population boast of at least one Bengali As-ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 779 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentssociation, membership in which hinges not on nationality or religion but on speaking Bengali and on sharing a common culture and sensibility.28 A review of the foremost Bengali literary and intellectual magazine, Desh, confirms this continuing interaction. The magazine is published from Calcutta, but in several ways it is more of a Bengali magazine at large, av- idly read and contributed to by the elites on both sides of the Bengal bor- der. And quite apart from the literary interaction is the strong literary nos-talgia: a large body of fiction and non fiction in which political boundaries are blurred and commonalties almost romanticized. (The most prominent recent novel in English on this theme of artificial boundaries between the two Bengalsis Amitav Ghosh's The Shadow Lines , published in 1988.) An important connecting role in this process of cross-national interac- tion must be assigned to the influence of the 1913 Nobel laureateRabindranath Tagore on the language, literature, and culture of Bengali so- ciety. Few individuals anywhere have left such a lasting legacy in so many areas of life. In particular, Tagore had definite views on what constitutesthe modern life and the relevance of Western notions of the state and soci- ety, views that continue to inform the debates on modernization in the two Bengals and that formed the opinions of the leaders for a large part of thetwentieth century. The Muslim poet and thinker Kazi Nazrul, writing mainly in the 1920s and 1930s, is also noteworthy in this respect. His pronounce- ments on religion, women, and related matters were far ahead of his time (see, e.g., Amin 1997), and his popularity as a poet helped greatly in the elites' acceptance of his views on these matters as well. But these individuals are even more important for the way they are claimed by both Bengals. They are not seen as Hindu or Muslim, Indian or Bangladeshi; instead they are seen as Bengalis on whom Bengalis on both sides of the border feel they have a legitimate claim. This double claimingof influential Bengali figures has been highlighted recently in the enthusi- astic praise received in both West Bengal and Bangladesh by Amartya Sen, the Nobel laureate in economics for 1998. Sen himself has been quick toacknowledge his intellectual and emotional ties to both Bengals; he also established an educational foundation that will fund projects in both India and Bangladesh. Diffusion within political boundaries By diffusion we refer here to what Lesthaeghe and Vanderhoeft (1998) call\"social permeability\": the degree to which the ideas and behaviors of highersocioeconomic groups are able to spread to the general population. Studies from other parts of the world and of other times also demonstrate the role of strong networks between the elites and the masses and in particular be-tween urban elites and the rural population in fostering modernization and780 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentssocial change, and, especially, fostering a faster pace of such change, whether in fertility decline or in some other facet of behavior. Rozman (1990), for example, contends that compared to China, Japanese society in the nine- teenth century was particularly well poised for modernization because ofthe constant circulation of its elites from the provincial towns to the capital. Both West Bengal and Bangladesh have long had the potential for un- usually strong interactions between the elites and the general population.In particular, there has been much scope for interaction between the urban elites and the rural population, an interaction that could be exploited to disseminate information, attitudes, and ideology and to effect change in gen-eral if this were in the interests of the elites. This scope for interaction has its origins both in historical factors and in the primary allegiance to a com- mon language. The historical reasons for this close urban-rural link are similar in the two regions. In West Bengal the original urban elites were drawn largely from individuals who already belonged to the landed rural aristocracy orelse used their newly generated urban wealth (wealth generated in the pro- cess of becoming merchants and bankers in a fast-growing Calcutta under the East India Company) to become large landowners or zamindars under the framework of the Permanent Settlement Act of 1793. In both cases, the newly educated Bengal elites thus tended to have strong rural connections. 29 Indeed, these connections usually included extended families left behind in the village (including, often, wives and children), leading to a pervasive sense of nostalgia for the village of origin. This nostalgia expressed itself in many ways. At the level of semantics it was evident in the way in which the urban elites of Bengal of the past (and often today's as well) refer differently to the city (or town) home and the village home: the former is the basha or temporary lodging, the latter is the bari or home (see, e.g., S. Sarkar 1997; Chatterji 1994; Chaudhuri 1968; Chakrabarty 1996). It expressed through regular visits to the vil- lages to collect rents but also to socialize and keep up family connections;and through the development of a literature and a poetry that eulogized the countryside. That this nostalgia and this interaction did not leave the general rural population unaffected by the changes taking place in the me-tropolis is suggested by the partition of Bengal in 1905. Ostensibly moti- vated by administrative considerations, it also had deeper roots in the threats perceived by Lord Curzon, Viceroy from 1898 to 1905, from an emergingmiddle-class nationalism in Bengal that he feared was being fueled by the close connections between Calcutta politicians and the East Bengal districts where many of them had their small-town or village homes (S. Sarkar 1997). 30 In what is today Bangladesh, the Bengali-speaking leadership that emerged after the creation of Pakistan had even stronger and more inti- mate rural roots than the leaders of West Bengal. The urban Muslim intelli-ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 781 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsgentsia that dominated the Calcutta of colonial India owed its primary alle- giance to Urdu as a language and as a source of its culture, while Bengali Muslim culture was considered an attribute of the lower-class Muslim peas- antry (see, e.g., Murshid 1995; Ahmed 1996). Most of these ashraf moved to West Pakistan at the time of the partition, and the new educated middle class that emerged and found a voice in East Pakistan consisted mainly of Bengali-speaking middle-level landholders who moved to Dhaka and otherurban centers. These migrants to the city maintained rural links in the same way as the Hindu bhadralok of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In more recent times, the independence movement, which reinforcedBangladeshi national identity, also strengthened the sense of commonality between the urban elites and the rural population and must be at least partly responsible for the rural zeal of the urban-based contemporary NGO move-ment in Bangladesh. In both West Bengal and Bangladesh these urban-rural links have been reinforced by the earlier movements to simplify the Bengali language amongthe Hindus and Muslims of greater Bengal. This simplification of the lan- guage, at least among the Hindus of colonial Bengal, got its impetus from the growth of the print media. 31 It also gained impetus from key individuals such as Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar (T. Sarkar 1997) and Rabindranath Tagore (Sen 1960), who were concerned about the elitist nature of the existing language and its inability to reach out to the general population. Amongthe Muslims in colonial Bengal, the simplification of the language was spurred by the new proselytizing efforts by Islamic leaders in the Bengal countryside (S. Sarkar 1997). This trend toward simplification meant that a common language be- tween urban and rural Bengalis (both Hindu and Muslim) was much more a truly common language than the earlier notional commonality in whichthe elite or educated Hindus and Muslims spoke a Bengali that was heavily Sanskritized or Persianized, respectively, while the nonliterate population spoke and understood colloquial, simpler versions of the language. 32 Indeed, the growth of the print media together with the simplification of the Bengali language has been another important factor in fostering links between the elites and the masses in the two Bengals. This fostering hasbeen possible in spite of slow increases in rural literacy, because a vital part of the success of printing rested on the way in which the ideas and stories on the printed page could be spread by the tradition of the literate few read-ing aloud to the illiterate many. Printing also reached a wider audience in- directly. For example, the advent of cheap and plentiful publishing democ- ratized new ideas and thoughts because it included a spurt in the writing ofliterature for public performance, moving plays from the exclusivity of the homes of rich patrons to the more accessible public theatres and halls that sprang up to accommodate this new surge of popular writing (S. Sarkar782 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contents1997). Needless to say, this new printed and performed literature was not all modern\u2014indeed, it often satirized the modern\u2014but it nevertheless meant that more and more people were being exposed to and learning to tolerate new modes of thought and behavior.33 These trends have persisted over time, and, on the whole, it is reason- able to say that social permeability in the two Bengals has been effective enough to counter more conservative forces opposed to radical change. InBangladesh in particular, it is striking how periodic attempts by conserva- tive religious forces to block the women-oriented or otherwise modern pro- grams of the government (in family planning, for example) have not stoppedtheir promotion by the mainstream governmental and nongovernmental agencies or their acceptance by the general population even though it is largely rural, nonliterate, and Muslim. 34 As for the social change that can be accelerated by such urban-rural interactions, quite apart from the demographic example of the family plan- ning program in Bangladesh, successful examples of mass mobilizationabound in both Bengals. In West Bengal, the most striking manifestation of such interaction is political. The nearly quarter-century rule in West Ben- gal of the Communist Party (Marxist) of India (CPM) is remarkable for theway in which its leaders are mainly Western-style and often Western-edu- cated city people (one scholar 35 refers to them as \"radical gentlemen\") while its mass base is rural and vast. Indeed, the CPM has very little mass supportin Calcutta or the larger urban areas (on the great rural penetration of the Communist Party in West Bengal, see Rogaly 1998); what it has been able to exploit effectively is the intimacy of the real and imagined urban-ruralrelationship in the state. A related example of successful interaction can be found in West Bengal's early and wholehearted adoption of the system of panchayati raj (a parallel structure of local government ) that India has adopted in principle since 1978, but that until recently only West Bengal seems to have adopted in practice (Webster 1992). And in Bangladesh, the mass mo- bilization programs of both the state and the nongovernmental sector (ofwhich BRAC, a development organization, and the Grameen Bank are two examples) represent that country's own brand of successful urban-rural in- teractions. Moreover, in both West Bengal and Bangladesh, the new agricultural technology adopted in rural areas has meant that West Bengal in recent years has seen the fastest growth in agricultural production in the country,while Bangladesh saw a massive rise in agricultural production in the 1980s (see Rogaly, Harriss-White, and Bose 1999; Ahmed, Haggblade, and Chowdhury 2000). This growth has occurred in contrasting policy environ ments in the two regions (a Communist Party focused on land reforms in West Bengal and a government focused on agricultural liberalization in Bangladesh), leav- ing researchers to decide which set of policies is more conducive to agricul-tural growth. But our analysis here suggests that perhaps more importantALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 783 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsthan the policies themselves are the implementation of policies and the cre- ation of an environment conducive to growth and change through the mass mobilization that characterizes the Bengal region. Extending this discussion to fertility control, one can more easily ex- plain the fertility decline that West Bengal has also experienced in spite of little official commitment to the family planning program, in contrast to the influential program in Bangladesh. One may also more confidently pre-dict that a greater official commitment to a family planning program in the state may result in greater success than in some other parts of India. As for the governmental and NGO success in spreading birth control in Bangla-desh, our analysis suggests it is not surprising that this diffusion process has not been as easy to duplicate in other parts of South Asia and the Middle East that share a common religion with Bangladesh but not a history ofearlier modernization. For example, as Amin and Lloyd (1998) describe in their comparative analysis, Bangladesh has been much better able than Egypt to withstand the rise of varieties of religious opposition to many of its mod-ernization efforts (at both the provider and the client level) without offi- cially suppressing or opposing these fundamentalist groups. Conclusions This article has sought to endogenize the agents of social change in order to improve understanding of some of the conditioning factors that facilitate fertility decline. It argues that looking solely at the immediate causes of re- productive change may distort our understanding of policy options by fail-ing to take into account the historical and cultural factors that affect not only the impact of policies and programs but the very existence and nature of these policies and programs. By presenting a joint study of Bangladesh and West Bengal, we have tried to demonstrate that historical and cultural factors are important influ- ences on reproductive change. While the role of historical processes in so-cial change has been neglected, the role of culture tends to be obscured in contemporary debates on this issue that often view cultural attributes merely within political boundaries. Thus in research on Bangladesh, for example,culture is defined in terms of the educational levels of Bangladeshi women or their autonomy in movement and decisionmaking. At other times, the nature of Islamic marriage and the family is treated as the key cultural at-tribute. The little change that these various indicators have exhibited over the years is taken to demonstrate the irrelevance of social and cultural change to the fertility decline that is occurring there. We have taken a different perspective on culture in this study. This perspective has two elements. On the one hand, cultural change is described in terms of changes in worldviews or ideologies as well as, to a lesser ex-tent, in norms about appropriate behavior. Such cultural change may be784 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsreflected in changes in some cultural attributes and not in others. For ex- ample, it is possible for a change in family-size norms (one kind of cultural attribute) to occur without change in women's autonomy in movement (an- other cultural attribute). That is, declining fertility may be seen as a pro-found cultural change in itself rather than as an outcome of other kinds of cultural change. Our second perspective on culture sees it as a facilitating variable: some cultural attributes of a population make it easier or harder for individuals to gain exposure to new ways of thinking and to respond positively to new ideas. Moreover, there is more to this facilitating aspect of culture thanwomen's education and the nature of the family. In particular, there is the strong impact of language (the Bengali language in this case), which often transcends the religious identity of a population (as witnessed most starklyin Bangladesh's independence movement) and which links the country with its Bengali counterpart in India (the state of West Bengal) in ways that few other cross-cultural interactions demonstrate. This continuous and intenseinteraction between Bangladesh and West Bengal and the strong sense of common identity conferred by the Bengali language are important sources of the diffusion of ideas and attitudes in both regions, so that the Bengaliculture as a whole is often more progressive and open to outside influences than either Hindu or Muslim culture in general. This observation could explain, for example, the conclusion by Dyson (1996) that the Bengali region of South Asia may have begun its fertility decline as early as 1960. It could also explain the convergence of fertility levels in Bangladesh and West Bengal 36 in spite of radically different poli- cies in the field, and, in contrast, the vast gulf in fertility levels between two other contiguous but politically separate areas that speak the same language: the Punjabi-speaking regions of India and Pakistan (see, e.g., Ramesh 1996).In the Punjab case, all indications are that the language identity is not strong enough to overcome the communication barriers imposed by religion and by political borders. In the Bengal case, the role of cross-border interactions isalso suggested by the commonality of fertility behavior in the districts along the border separating the two Bengals (Amin, Basu, and Stephenson 2000). We have proposed that the best diffusion channels are those that are both homogeneous and heterogeneous; the Bengal experience suggests that each kind has a role to play. Homogeneous cultural networks (a common language in this case) can facilitate the transmission of new modes of thoughtand behavior; this facilitating role of language has been used to at least partly explain the patterns exhibited by the European fertility transition as well as by some contemporary transitions (see, e.g., Montgomery and Casterline1998 and several chapters in Leete 1999). When the common language is also associated with a strong sense of loyalty to it, this ease of transmission is further facilitated because there is an urge to make it a vital means of com-ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 785 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsmunication between the elites and the masses: we have sought to demonstrate this point with examples of mass mobilizations by different entities in the two Bengals.37 On the other hand, socioeconomic and geographic heterogeneity in diffusion channels increases exposure to new ideas that are subsequently diffused; obviously one's immediate contacts have less that is new to tell us than do those who inhabit another, often larger world. The importance ofheterogeneous networks is becoming apparent in studies that document the role of global networks in contemporary fertility decline (see, in particular, Bongaarts and Watkins 1996) and in the literature on the role of elites infostering social change. Bengali-speaking elites or reference groups are thus important sources of transmission of new ideas among the general popula- tion. In addition, these groups have themselves been doubly blessed in thisrespect. On the one hand, they have the historical experience of early and intense exposure to the modern world in the ways described above; on the other hand, by occupying politically different spaces (that is, West Bengaland Bangladesh), they continue to have interaction with and exposure to a wider religious, political, and policy world than do Muslim populations in other parts of the Islamic world and Hindu populations in other parts ofIndia. The result, we suggest, is that the elites of Bangladesh and West Ben- gal display a greater intellectual and ideological progressiveness than their counterparts in these other regions, a progressiveness that has on occasionbeen communicated outward through the medium of a common language. These findings may also be seen as contributing to a process of reflec- tion on two matters. The first matter is methodological. While the policycommunity emphasizes national political boundaries with good reason, fo- cusing research and analysis on populations delineated by political bound- aries may obscure important insights. In an increasingly interconnectedworld it makes sense to look at \"outside\" influences on behavior (e.g., Bon- gaarts and Watkins 1996); our study suggests that such influences and in- teractions are not merely a feature of contemporary technology. They mayjust as well exist between otherwise closed, politically demarcated areas that have a shared history and culture. To that extent, we may be wrong if we assume that the Bangladesh-West Bengal case is unique. Our guess, how-ever, is that such a strong loyalty to a common language is rare. Thus, this kind of analysis needs to be strengthened through application to other parts of the world. The second matter on which this study may throw some light is the absence of comparable fertility change in many other parts of the world. While it might not be much help to the impatient policymaker to be toldthat some populations are quicker to respond to antinatalist policies than others, by endogenizing policymakers and aspects of governance we hope to add to our understanding of the larger historical and cultural constraints786 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentson policymakers themselves. The central conclusion in this context is that for diffusion to serve as an effective channel of social change, two conditions must be satisfied: the elites must be sufficiently advanced themselves as re- flected in the indicators of social change, and they must have strong channelsof interactions with the general population. Slower social change in Latin America in spite of a modern elite may be explained by the scantiness of this elite's interactions with the rural population; and slow change in sub-Saharan Africa in spite of strong networks of urban-rural interaction may be explained by the greater personal traditionalism of the elites (on both matters see Guzman 1994). In both regions, in short, there is only partialfulfillment of the two conditions necessary for change through diffusion. 38 Ours is not meant to be a deterministic model of social change; it leaves room for what may be called \"quakes,\" or sudden changes in a hithertoplacid environment. Political upheavals provide the most potent example of this and may be especially relevant to the experience of rapid fertility change in countries such as Vietnam. 39 While such quakes may contribute to a rapid transformation of society, our article suggests that historical pro- cesses may otherwise leave an imprint that shapes a society's predisposi- tions for a long time to come.

We merely assert that when theychoose to effect mass change, for the histori- cal and cultural reasons discussed here, the Bengali elites seem to be more successful than their counterparts elsewhere. As for their mo- tivations in trying to effect such change, these may usually be self-serving. In this article we use such words as \"elites,\" \"masses,\" \"liberal,\" and \"modern\" in a merely descriptive way, without any of the value judgments, positive or negative, that the terms also usually imply. 3 Because this article is concerned with the potential influence of the elites on fertility control, and because fertility change may be viewed as a move from traditional to more modern forms of behavior, the elites described here are those who have themselves acquired the knowledge and opinions that go to form a modern worldview or ideology and who are in turn in a position to affect the beliefs and behaviors of others. In this sense and in this context, the elites may be defined loosely as the modern intelligentsia of a society, the in- telligentsia in turn being defined, in the words of one of the most influential works on theALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 787 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentssubject, as those groups or individuals in a so- ciety \"whose special task it is to provide an in- terpretation of the world for that society\" (Mannheim 1936). To that extent we include more than the economic or political elites in our analysis. Indeed, there is much evidence not only that South Asian policy has tradition- ally been informed more by the intellectual than the political elites, but that the political elite has traditionally been drawn largely from the intellectual elites to begin with. 4 Although primary-level education in In- dia is highest in Kerala, college levels of edu- cation are highest in West Bengal; see, e.g., In- ternational Institute for Population Studies (1995b). 5 The micro level political economy of re- productive change in particular and demo- graphic change in general has, on the other hand, received much attention in recent years, especially with the growth of anthropological demography; indeed, this detailed attention to the household perspective has sometimes led to a neglect of the role of larger forces, includ- ing the state itself, in promoting change (see Basu 1997). 6 Nathanson (1996) makes a related point about some of the underlying social and po- litical processes that promote or hinder suc- cessful health policies. It is often not enough to know that certain technologies are effective against certain diseases. When and how the policies that incorporate these technologies are implemented requires an understanding of the larger sociopolitical context. 7 As Inkeles (1983) discusses, Westerniza- tion refers to the adoption of the cultural and intellectual attributes of the Western world as they evolved in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; at other times, individual modernity may well have been an attribute more com- mon in non-Western cultures. On this, see also Sen (2000). 8It is notable that the first signs of fertil- ity decline in the United States appeared in New England after the Revolutionary War (Ewbank 1991), with another noticeable drop after the Civil War (David and Sanderson 1987). 9 Lesthaeghe and Wilson (1986) refer to an interesting earlier work by Wolf (1912), which broached this idea of a change inWeltanschauung being involved in changing fer- tility behavior. Wolf's analysis suggested a re- lationship between birth rates and the percent- age of votes cast for the Socialist Party in Germany. This is an intriguing idea, of particu- lar relevance to the Indian states of Kerala and West Bengal, which must be the only parts of the world to have had democratically elected Communist Parties in power for long periods of time. Kerala is recognized as a demographic pioneer, and, as we suggest in this article, West Bengal too has some unique features condu- cive to fertility decline. 10 The East India Company, once it gained formal administrative control of its Indian ter- ritories, divided these into three Presidencies: Bengal, Bombay, and Madras. Beginning in 1773, overall authority was invested in the Governor-General, who operated from Ben- gal Presidency and whose authority extended to the Governors who administered Bombay and Madras Presidencies. Over time and even more so after the Crown took over, these ter- ritories were expanded, reorganized, and re- named, but Calcutta remained the seat of the central government until 1911. 11 S. Sarkar (1997) would add the impact of chakri , the employment of the newly edu- cated middle classes primarily in clerical posi- tions in the British government in Bengal and other parts of India. The mixed effects of this employment are particularly important for the middle rungs of the newly literate, who did not contribute to the renaissance in the same way as the upper middle classes composed of lawyers, doctors, and other professionals, but who nevertheless acquired and often unknow- ingly disseminated the new knowledge and ideas emanating from the latter. 12To quote from Thomas Macaulay's Minute on Education of 1835, this education was needed to create \"a class of persons Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in opin- ions, in morals and in intellect...who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern\" (cited in Clive 1973: 376). 13 In addition, the moral and philosophi- cal content of the Western educational sylla- bus in Bombay tended for a long time to in- spire a reform of the self (that is, of the newly educated individual) rather than of the larger society (McDonald 1966), something that was788 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentsat the root of the ideological content of the col- lege syllabus in Calcutta. 14 Indeed, the philosophical content of this education virtually begged to be used in this way (see, e.g., Bagchi 1991). That this is by no means a uniquely Bengal phenomenon is illustrated in Anderson (1991). 15 Nevertheless, a rejection of the past and of traditional beliefs was also an important component of many debates during the Ben- gal renaissance. Several writers have described the heated debates on atheism that took place in many of the literary societies of the day (see, e.g., Sanyal 1980). 16 From the beginning of the twentieth century, Malthusian arguments for reduced population growth were well entrenched and accepted by the elites of the Indian sub- continent. And while acceptance of such ar- guments explains the genesis of family plan- ning programs in this region (see, e.g., Robinson 1996; Khuda et al. 1996), it does not explain how these similarly planned and mo- tivated programs had such sharply different levels of success in various parts of South Asia. For example, the Malthusianism inculcated in the training of the bureaucracy that Khuda et al. mention as one factor in the fertility de- cline in Bangladesh was part of the training of the civil service in West Pakistan as well. 17 Indeed, it was only the upper-class (but not necessarily upper-caste) Hindu who ini- tially participated in this growth in modern- ization. Western-style education was expen- sive; when it was professional, it took many years; and its most popular subjects (literature and the humanities) were most consistent with the interests and aptitudes of a landed leisure class. For all these reasons, it often servedmerely to transform \"an aristocracy of wealth\" into an \"aristocracy of culture\" (Chatterji 1994). 18 As early as 1863, Abdul Latif, the most prominent Muslim public figure of Calcutta, started the Mahomedan Literary Society to \"imbue its members with a desire to interest themselves in western learning and progress, and to give them an opportunity for the culti- vation of social and intellectual intercourse with the best representatives of English and Hindoo society\" (Latif, cited in Sanyal 1980). Also around this Bengali Muslim \"intellectuals like Sayyid Ahmed Khanand Syed Ameer Ali, deeply influenced by Western ideas, began to give rational interpre- tations of the Koran and Hadith. They sought to differentiate between the 'fundamentals' and the 'accidentals' of Islam, and urged the adoption of the fundamentals as opposed to the ancillary aspects of their religion\" (Akter Banu 1992: 175). 19 In a major ideological turnaround, the \"socialism\" pillar, too, was replaced, with \"so- cial justice.\" 20 \"Bengali identity\" interchangeably in this \"nationalism\" in our analy- sis refers to \"identity\" without reference to \"statehood.\" That is, it does not follow that na- tionhood coincides with statehood. What we describe is a largely depoliticized concept of nationality, a \"renunciation of the idea that those who feel themselves to be a nation should necessarily constitute an independent state of their own\" (Prasad 1944). While Ben- gali nationalism did eventually lead to the cre- ation of Bangladesh, this nationalism in the first place was not tied to questions of nation- hood; its proponents were quite willing for it to exist within the larger political entity of Pa- kistan until its language identity was denied. 21 Perhaps this \"self-obsession\" (Chatterji 1994) is best illustrated by the Bengali word for those who belong to other parts of India. These individuals are described not as belonging, say, to Tamil Nadu, Punjab, or Kerala, but as abangali , that is, non-Bengali. In other words, there are the Bengalis, and there is everyone else. 22Bhadralok is the Bengali term for the edu- cated middle class, but actually means much more than this. It is the term used to describe the elites of Bengal by themselves and by knowledgeable outsiders, and its exact sense is best captured by a frequently quoted definition from Broomfield (1968), \"a socially privileged and consciously su- perior group, economically dependent upon landed rents and professional and clerical employ- ment\" (pp. 12-13). 23 For example, the members of the Soci- ety for the Promotion of National Pride were fined one paisa for every word of English that they used at their meetings (Chowdhury 1998). 24 The movement also grew out of a re- sistance to other tendencies toward Islamiza- tion of the government of West Pakistan\u2014in-ALAKA MALWADE BASU / S AJEDA AMIN 789 Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentscluding attempts to introduce the Persian script for writing Bengali in East Pakistan and the periodic ban on performances and broadcasts of the music and arts of Hindu Bengalis such as Rabindranath Tagore. 25 There was growing opposition in East Bengal to the determination of the rulers of erstwhile Pakistan to have only Urdu as the official national language. This opposition cul- minated on 21 February 1952 in a series of well-orchestrated strikes and demonstrations organized by the newly formed State Language Action Council of East Pakistan. A number of demonstrators were killed in the police firing that followed the strikes, which the central government had anticipated and sought to pre- vent by the imposition of a ban on processions and strikes. 26 Personal interview (1999) with Mrs. Chitra Bhattacharya, Member of Parliament and prominent women's activist, in Dhaka. 27 Indeed, this constant interaction was a matter of concern to the government of Pa- kistan before the independence of Bangladesh and led to futile attempts to ban the import of books, music, and films from West Bengal into East Pakistan in the 1960s. This ban probably did little more than fuel further the Language Movement that helped produce an indepen- dent Bangladesh. 28 These associations are usually quite ac- tive: the North American Bengali Association, for example, has a week-long conference (called the NABC by the initiated) every year, in which activities and events are organized that rely freely on expertise from both Bengals. 29 By contrast, in the Bombay and Ma- dras Presidencies, modern education was first taken up by groups that were predominantly urban, or, if they had begun life in the village, did not represent the more powerful or influ- ential elements of the village. 30 Less charitable explanations of the in- teractions between the Bengali bhadralok and the rural population have focused on this be- ing one way for the former to increase their power and patronage in colonial Bengal (see, e.g., Chowdhury 1998; Guha 1989). 31 It is interesting that the simplification of the Bengali language was originally moti- vated by the need to make the women of up-per-class families better helpmeets to their rap- idly modernizing husbands rather than to fos- ter interclass communication. The women of upper-class families could not at first be sent out to schools to be educated; their education therefore had to come from magazines that catered to them in their own simpler, more colloquial Bengali. As Peary Chand Mitra pointed out in the inaugural maga- zine, Masik Patra, in 1854: \"This magazine is published for ordinary people, particularly for women. All compositions will be written in a language in which we carry out our day to day conversations. If learned pandits wish to read this, they may do so, but this magazine is not for them.\" Indeed, in his Dialogues Intended to Facilitate the Acquiring of the Bengalee Language , a compendium of the customs and language of the different classes and castes of Bengal, published in 1801, the Orientalist William Carey classified women with the low castes for \"the vulgarity of their speech\" (Sangari and Vaid 1997). 32 The miscommunication possible be- tween different groups that ostensibly speak the same language can occur despite rising lit- eracy levels, thus greatly hampering develop- mental efforts that hinge on the transmission of new ideas or instructions. Gumperz (1957) describes, in the case of north India, the high levels of misunderstanding by villagers with more than five years of schooling of simple governmental pamphlets; for the illiterate, who depended on having these pamphlets read to them, the misunderstanding was even more complete. 33 T. Sarkar (1997) illustrates the diverse opinions to which the Bengal population has long been exposed by popular print and visual media. A local case of adultery and murder in the late nineteenth century was publicized and discussed at so many levels and with so many interpretations through newspapers, popular plays, novels, and paintings that it ended up doing two important things: (1) it democra- tized the debates because different categories of people were all exposed to the moral, legal, and political issues through these varied fo- rums; and (2) it exposed people to a variety of opinions on such issues\u2014the guilty party be- ing sometimes seen as the woman (for having an adulterous relationship), sometimes the husband (who murdered her), sometimes the790 CONDITIONING FACTORS FOR FERTILITY DECLINE IN BENGAL Click to return to Table of ContentsClick to return to Table of Contentspriest (with whom she had the adulterous re- lationship), sometimes the colonial state (which convicted the husband of murder), and sometimes the system of patriarchy (which forced young wives to visit their parents for respite and in this case exposed the wife to the priest's attentions). The main outcome of this widespread debate (and Sarkar stresses that her case is only illustrative) was that no notions or traditions were sacred; they could all be de- bated. 34 Indeed, it is striking just how limited the impact of conservative religious forces has been until recent years. Part of the resistance to the attempts of religious conservatives to forestall social changes may be attributed to their perceived role as collaborators in Pakistan's governance of East Pakistan before 1971. This factor undoubtedly helped President Ziaur Rahman to implement many programs\u2014 in the area of family planning and women's employment, for example\u2014that conservative religious leaders decried. But in addition, mass movements against religious fundamentalism seem to have emerged in response to a cul- ture of positive attitudes to modernization. To quote an otherwise pessimistic scholar on Bangladesh (Feldman 1998), the Jama'at-I- Islami (the primary conservative religious party) \"is continually challenged by an increas-ingly organized opposition, which has included a more vocal and organized women's move- ment that has successfully mobilized rural women.\" 35 Kamal Siddique (personal communi- cation, 1999). 36 But this convergence may not last as fertility decline in Bangladesh continues at a faster pace because of greater official commit- ment to the decline. 37 That this social permeability is impor- tant is also suggested by the continuing con- servatism of the lower-income Bangladeshi di- aspora, in the United Kingdom for example. Not having access to interaction with cultur- ally homogeneous reference groups, these im- migrants are often much slower to change than the rural populations they have left behind. 38 In the modern world, diffusion pro- cesses may of course also be promoted by less interpersonal means. The mass media and good transportation come immediately to mind as examples. 39 Political upheavals are, in one sense, analogous to language identity in that they give otherwise diverse populations what may be called a shared worldview.

M ONTGOMERY THE TOPIC of mortality risk perceptions has somehow failed to engage the interest of demographers. Perhaps this is because in demography, as in so- cial science more generally, the passage from socioeconomic change to in-dividual perceptions of change has been assumed to be immediate, or to involve lags of little consequence. If individual perceptions adjust quickly to changing empirical realities, such perceptions can justifiably be ignored.In the case of mortality decline in developing countries, however, there is good reason to believe that perceptions are likely to be diffuse, are quite possibly biased upward in relation to the empirical risks, and are probablyrather slow to adjust to declines in those risks. I base these propositions not on a large empirical literature in demog- raphy\u2014there is almost no literature of this kind to cite\u2014but on findingsfrom cognitive and social psychology, disciplines in which probability and risk assessment have been intensively studied. A sketch of the findings from their literatures is as follows. When laypersons attempt to understand mor-tality decline, they are apt to bring to the task a great variety of rules of thumb and heuristic standards of judgment (see, among others, McKenzie 1994; Mellers, and Coale Kahneman 1974). The layperson's understanding of probability and risk is imperfect at best, and is particularly so when the probabilities are changing or when a correct assessment requires fine discrimination amonglevels of risk. Individual perceptions and individual experience alone may not then suffice. Furthermore, social learning\u2014that is, learning from the experiences of family, peers, social network partners, and mass media\u2014may suffer from biases and uncertainties that are similar to those affecting individual perception. The usual perceptual difficulties are greatly amplified in the case of mortality by the fact that mortality decline is not fully exogenous. Rather,796 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentsin developing countries it involves a new set of social and political actors and institutions\u2014those constituting the modern health care system\u2014whose methods may not initially be accepted or judged to be clearly effective. Whether mortality decline is perceived is not just a matter of correct as-sessment of the external environment, but also a matter of how such new institutions establish credibility and win the trust of their clients. Biases and lags in mortality perception may have a number of im- plications for demographic behavior. The most immediate of these may be seen in the motivations for modern health care, in which perceptual lags may leave doubts about the net gains to be expected from such care. Theconcepts of perceived efficacy and personal agency are pertinent here. But mortality decline has also been regarded as an important mechanism in fertility decline, taking a leading role in the formulation of demographictransition theory by Notestein (1945). It may be that biases in the percep- tion of mortality decline, which cause the full extent of change to be screened from view, have much to do with delays in the response of fertil-ity. Lloyd and Ivanov (1988) wrote of a \"transition effect,\" by which mor- tality decline brings greater predictability to the external environment and enhances individual confidence and the sense of personal control. Thesedevelopments, in turn, may encourage a longer-term view of family-build- ing and thereby set the stage for adoption of fertility control. One can imag- ine situations in which the motivation of parents to invest in the schoolingof their children are also linked to perceived mortality risks. Lags and up- ward biases in mortality perception could therefore delay progress in both the quantity and quality dimensions of the fertility transition. In the first section to follow, I sketch the health decision environ- ment as it might be seen by a developing-country family, and single out the features of this environment that depend on perceptions. In the sec-ond section, drawing upon the rich literature in cognitive and social psy- chology, I stress the limits and potential biases that can distort probability perceptions and discuss how social learning\u2014learning from others\u2014caneither correct or amplify individual biases. The third section presses the argument further, linking it to aspects of both modern and traditional health care. The key question in this section is how perceptions and social defini-tions shape beliefs about the relative efficacy of modern health care as com- pared to the traditional alternatives. In the fourth section, I turn to the implications for fertility and in- vestments in human capital. The links of mortality to fertility include the aforementioned transition effect and the three mechanisms identified by Preston (1978)\u2014the insurance, replacement, and lactation-interruption ef-fects. Although the connection of mortality to fertility has been the subject of considerable research (see Preston 1978; Montgomery and Cohen 1998), the insurance and transition effects remain poorly understood, and I arguethat mortality perceptions are a central factor in these effects. As for hu-MARK R. M ONTGOMERY 797 Click to return to Table of Contentsman capital investments, I consider several pathways of influence through which perceived mortality decline might enhance motivations for invest- ment. In the concluding section, I offer suggestions for a new research agenda. The health decision environment The task of detecting lower mortality might seem trivial at first glance, butconsider the many social and perceptual issues that face families as they attempt to evaluate mortality risk. There is, first, the difficulty posed by multiple levels and actors. Mortality is partly the result of endogenous be-havior on the part of families, as they choose among various forms of health treatment and prevention. The risk level also depends on exogenous fac- tors that lie outside family control, such as state-initiated investments inwater supply and sanitation, the extension of modern health service deliv- ery, and the development of a modern private sector in health care. The second difficulty, which follows from the first, is that the parameters of thedecision environment are changing, as new ideas about health care are introduced and new behavioral options are made available. The resulting trends in mortality are thus the product of powerful exogenous forces andthe multiple endogenous responses to them. Owing to this mix of the exogenous and endogenous, families seek- ing evidence on mortality risk will probably draw their information from avariety of sources. For some families, perhaps, a general sketch of the situ- ation might suffice to summarize the risks. Others will require more infor- mation, seeking to understand what features of the changing health envi-ronment and what new options for health care yield demonstrably lower risks overall. For such families, the question of mortality decline is linked inextricably to changing information and transformed perceptions of mod-ern and traditional health care. In what follows, my central thesis is that it is far more difficult than one might suppose for families left to their own devices to perceive eventhe general outlines of mortality decline. The empirical facts will often be hidden from their view, obscured at least for a time by a number of per- ceptual barriers. For more accessible evidence, families may turn to theimmediately surrounding health and health care environment, which will present both modern and traditional features. They may be persuaded of mortality decline if they can see in this heterogeneous environment clearevidence of the efficacy of modern health care. In this way, perceptions of mortality decline may depend to a considerable extent on perceptions of the modern health system. To appreciate these issues, let us consider a family's perspective in more detail. Figure 1 depicts the situation that a family might face when one of its children falls ill. Three choice options are assumed to be avail-798 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentsable: do nothing and hope for the child's recovery; make use of traditional care, which entails costs ct; or seek modern medical treatment, with asso- ciated costs cm. The outcome of any of these choices is uncertain, and such uncertainty is expressed in the mortality probabilities pn, pt, and pm that are associated with the choice alternatives.1 A rational decisionmaker, upon surveying this range of costs and probabilities, would select the type of care offering the highest expected net benefit. For those who have adopted Western views about medical care, it might be taken as a given that pm < pt and pm < pn. That is, holding constant the severity of the child's illness, such decisionmakers would rate the pros-pects for survival as better if the child is given modern treatment rather than traditional or no treatment. But how widely shared are such Western- influenced views? Are they mainly the beliefs of the better educated? What heterogeneity in views exists? Even if modern health treatment is com- monly acknowledged to have a higher payoff than traditional care (in the sense that p m < pt, the perceived margin of difference in these probabilities might be regarded as slight. Furthermore, if high costs cm hinder access to modern care, this could reverse its net advantage over the traditional modes. Important determinants of such costs lie on the supply side, where short-ages of medicines and personnel can render the modern system's superior- ity largely hypothetical. When taken together, all these costs and probabili- ties determine the proportions of families choosing modern health treatment. The likelihood of obtaining modern treatment will vary over time in response to trends in the outcome probabilities, the associated costs, or both. FIGURE 1 Decision options for the parents of an ill child Child is illNo care Traditional care at cost ct Modern care at cost cmChild survivesChild survives Child survives Child diesChild dies Child dies1 - pn pn 1 - pt pt 1 - pm pmMARK R. M ONTGOMERY 799 Click to return to Table of ContentsFor example, as general living standards improve, the probabilities of re- covery from illness may rise, so that pn, pt, and pm all decline. These changes may be proportional, or, if the quality of modern treatment also improves, pm may decline by the greatest proportion. If such changes are mirrored in perceptions, they should increase the motivation to use modern treatment and lead to a greater overall decline in mortality than would otherwise have occurred. Likewise, program-driven improvements in access to mod-ern care will reduce c m and thereby increase the likelihood of modern care.2 Figure 2 extends consideration to the prevention of illness. Here, the child is assumed to be initially healthy, and the question is whether toinvest family resources c a in obtaining a vaccination against a particular cause of illness (\"Cause A\"). The issues are not specific to vaccines; they could be illustrated with any relatively new preventive behavior. The ex-pected net benefit of the vaccine will depend on the perceived incidence of this cause (as expressed in the probability p a that an unvaccinated child will contract the illness) and will also depend on lay understandings of theefficacy of vaccines. Figure 2 depicts a situation in which the vaccine is believed to be perfectly effective in preventing Cause A illnesses. Of course, this may not be the way that vaccines are actually viewed. Suppose it isdifficult to distinguish between the symptoms of Cause A and the symp- toms of other causes of illness. How, then, does a layperson come to know that the vaccine is perfectly effective? Under what circumstances do theassurances of modern health personnel become credible? Child is healthyNo preventive care Preventive care (Vaccine A) at cost c aChild is healthy Child is healthyChild is ill of cause A Child is ill ofother cause1 - pa - p o popa 1 - po poChild is ill of other causeFIGURE 2 Decision options for the parents of a healthy child800 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of ContentsThe family's motivation to adopt a new preventive behavior (here, a vaccination) will be derived, in part, from the consequences it would face if prevention fails. In this way, the costs of health treatment and the out- come probabilities that were sketched in Figure 1 would affect the per-ceived net benefits of the preventive vaccination option shown in Figure 2. If families behave as if they conceptually linked Figures 1 and 2, then their decisions about prevention would depend in a complicated fashionon a host of probabilities and costs. The image just invoked, of rational family decisionmakers assessing various health decision options, requires further elaboration. The costs andprobabilities of Figures 1 and 2 are properly viewed as subjective quanti- ties, having values that are dependent on the information available to the family and the way in which that information is processed. In no socioeco-nomic setting\u2014not even in the most highly developed of Western societ- ies\u2014will very many families have knowledge of disease incidence prob- abilities and mortality risks. In general, and particularly in poor developingcountries, such risks will be understood in terms of approximate compari- sons and subjective rankings or ranges. 3 A developing-country family thus faces a complex set of tasks in seek- ing to understand mortality risks. A correct assessment\u2014one that accords with the objective risks\u2014would seem to require unusual sophistication and powers of discrimination. Sorting through the risks would be difficultenough in an unchanging environment, but the task is rendered even more difficult by variation over time in the exogenous probabilities and costs. Mortality perceptions In this section, I argue that individual perceptions of mortality risk are not likely to track the improving empirical realities without an intervening pe- riod of upward bias and uncertainty. Remarkably little demographic re- search has considered the possibility of a gap or lag between the changingempirical risks of mortality, on the one hand, and the perception of these risks, on the other. Some gaps and lags in understanding are to be expected, of course, but the social circumstances associated with long lags and en-during biases in perception have not been studied. Although the demo- graphic literature has been largely silent on the matter, some insights can be gleaned from an extensive literature in cognitive and social psychologyon the issue of lay perceptions and understandings of risk and probability (for a review, see Montgomery 1998). This literature suggests that, if left to their own perceptual devices, individuals may be poorly equipped to comprehend the improvements in survival that are underway. The facts that are readily accessible to them will seem to support alternative interpretations, and considerable time canMARK R. M ONTGOMERY 801 Click to return to Table of Contentselapse before the downward trend in risk becomes fully apparent. One should therefore expect the initiation of mortality decline to be followed by an interim period during which the phenomenon is in doubt. Mortality decline will be dimly perceived by some but stoutly denied by others, andmost will be left uncertain. In many ways, the case of mortality decline exemplifies the percep- tual difficulties that confront laypeople in matters of probability and risk. 4 Some form of probabilistic thinking may well be required even to organize the relevant data. A lay counterpart to the concept of events (deaths) in relation to the population at risk seems to be needed, as well as a means ofgathering the numerators and denominators. It is not at all obvious how the layperson, situated in a rural village or living amidst the bustle of a developing-country city, would find himself equipped with such conceptsand information. Since mortality decline gives rise to more rapid natural increase, total deaths may increase even as the crude death rate decreases. This no doubt compounds the problem. A further difficulty is the natural tendency among laypeople to view death as the noteworthy event, with its logical complement, survival, at- tracting less attention. Psychologists would term survival a \"null event\"from the viewpoint of the layperson (Estes 1976; Nisbett and Ross 1980). As long as a child survives, nothing really seems to have happened, whereas a child's death is readily marked as an event. 5 Such perceptual biases are accentuated by the tendency, well documented in the psychological litera- ture, for negative events to exert a disproportionate influence on beliefs, with positive events appearing to have much less subjective impact (e.g.,Skowronski and Carlston 1989; Taylor 1991; Viscusi 1997). The literature also shows that, often, the layperson will attach too much weight to a small sample of immediate experience\u2014say, a few years'worth of births in his own village\u2014a tendency that can overwhelm the efforts of public health campaigns to convey the broader and more repre- sentative picture. Adding to these difficulties is what psychologists termthe \"primacy effect,\" by which events that occur early in a temporal se- quence appear to exert disproportionate influence over later beliefs. In the case of mortality experience, one might form one's first impressions of riskduring childhood or adolescence, these being relatively high-mortality pe- riods in an era of secularly declining mortality. This early experience may establish a durable perceptual frame that resists revision. One's own directexperience with risks, derived from a lower-mortality period, might prove insufficient to dislodge earlier beliefs. Another aspect of the problem is the need to separate average mor- tality risk from its variance (Slovic 1972). High-mortality environments of- ten exhibit considerable variability in mortality, with experience being punc- tuated by occasional episodes of famine, flood, and epidemic. Looking back802 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentson such experience, the layperson might find it difficult to discern the gen- eral downward trend in risk, with memory distracted by such vivid and catastrophic occurrences. The common theme in these observations\u2014necessarily offered tenta- tively, given the absence of demographic research\u2014is that individual per- ception alone is probably a poor device for detecting downward trends in mortality. Individuals cannot be expected to act as lay statisticians: theylack both the necessary information and the conceptual framework for or- ganizing it. If left to themselves, they would seem to be ill equipped to filter the signal from the surrounding noise. In time, of course, perceptions will come to be corrected and mortal- ity decline will come to be recognized. But if unaided individual percep- tion is as weak a discriminator as I have suggested, might the key to learn-ing be the information that individuals draw from their social interactions? Information can be gathered from interactions with family, discussions in peer groups and other social networks, and conversations with the better-educated; it can be distilled from media messages and from the modern health sector. All these can be regarded as avenues for social learning and diffusion (Montgomery and Casterline 1996), by which new ideas aboutmortality risks come to intermingle with the old. Learning from family Children growing up in high-mortality environments will inevitably know or hear of the deaths in infancy and childhood of their siblings and other relatives. Mothers, fathers, and elders may sometimes tell children of their own family histories, which unfolded in even higher-mortality eras. As chil-dren enter adulthood and begin to build their own families, much of the social knowledge they inherit would thus seem to exaggerate the current level of mortality risk. Counteracting this perception, however, is the possibility that with declining mortality, the parents of one generation will find themselves sur- prised by the number of their children who have survived, that is, sur-prised in relation to the smaller number they had somehow expected to survive. Parents may find their larger-than-anticipated families pressing against scarce resources such as land. Looking about them, they may ob-serve their peers also struggling to accommodate larger surviving families. When it can be set against some readily understandable denominator\u2014 such as arable land\u2014the fact of improved child survival may then clearlyimpress itself upon the older generation and become part of the social knowledge they bequeath to their own adult children. Social learning of this form would seem to require considerable time, during which the data are pieced together by the older generation, slowlyMARK R. M ONTGOMERY 803 Click to return to Table of Contentsunderstood, and the implications then imparted to the young. If this is in- deed the dominant form of social learning, it would imply very long lags\u2014 perhaps as much as a generation\u2014between the initial stages of mortality decline and the beginnings of a response in fertility or other demographicbehavior. The mechanism requires something akin to a comprehensible denominator, and the role suggested above for land might not apply to rural areas with substantial out-migration and might not have any obviouscounterpart in urban areas. Learning from social networks Networks of peers and other contemporaries may allow social learning to proceed at a faster pace. Just as with familial experience, however, it is difficult to say whether information drawn from social networks must nec- essarily reduce the upward biases of individual perceptions. Much dependson the nature of these networks and the variety of information possessed by network members. The notion of \"weak ties\" is pertinent here (Grano- vetter 1973). Consider an individual woman whose social network is homogeneous, being largely populated with her peers. Her network is then rather like a small population in which, over a short period, the stochastic nature ofbirths and deaths can give a misleading picture of the underlying prob- abilities. If her attention is selective, tending to focus on negative events, then instances of child death within the network will come readily to mind,will have the force of immediate example, and will seem to disprove the hypothesis of mortality decline. Moreover, in a high-mortality population, at least one woman in each network can be expected to know of a statisti-cally unusual case, such as a family that has lost all of its children. Her experience can be shared with her network partners, and if such atypical cases dominate perception, the propagation of information by networksmight further exaggerate individual bias. 6 As long as the perceptual biases described above are widely shared, and as long as individual network mem- bers possess no novel information that forces long-held beliefs to be reex-amined, the fact that individuals are linked to each other by networks need not bring perceptions any closer to the empirical realities. If social networks are heterogeneous, however, either in perceptual style or in information, then social interaction can serve as a corrective. Consider a case in which an uneducated woman is linked to a network partner who has some experience of primary school. Through schooling,this somewhat better-educated woman might have absorbed a few facts about health conditions and changes in survival. She could have learned to be more attentive to the messages about health and health care thatemanate from government and the media. 7 She might at least have been804 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentsexposed to the idea that mortality is controllable, a view that in itself would tend to heighten attention to information (Simons 1989). When shared with her network partners, the educated woman's example or experience might lead her partners toward a new way of thinking about their ownenvironments. Functioning in this way, heterogeneous networks, in which some members are connected to others who possess distinctive informa- tion, can assist in spreading new views of mortality risks and the emerginghealth care options. New conceptions of adult mortality risks may also be shaped by infor- mation exchange. Adult beliefs about risk may be much affected by theperceived incidence of premature death, whether resulting from maternal mortality, accident, or AIDS. In some developing-country settings (nota- bly, in West Africa), adult social networks can exhibit an extraordinarybreadth. 8 Such wide networks facilitate transmission of information about premature adult death, and this alone might cause the risks to be exagger- ated. Yet, wide networks may also offer weak links to better-educated orurban residents who have new ideas to share about improvements in health and declining mortality risks. Here, too, the net effects of social interaction are ambiguous and dependent on network structure and heterogeneity. Other social effects I have stressed the role of social learning in the transmission of informa- tion about risk, but some potentially important byproducts of social inter-action need not involve learning as such. Ewbank and Preston (1990) and Lindenbaum (1990), among others, have stressed the power of social ex- ample to spread new models of personal hygiene. In Lindenbaum's depic-tion of rural Bangladesh, better-educated women often adopt distinctive practices in their childrearing and discipline, in their treatment of food, and in the cleanliness and order they impose on home and courtyard. Theydo so not because they expect benefits to materialize in the form of better child survival\u2014there may be no perceived connection whatsoever\u2014but rather to establish a certain social distance between themselves and theother villagers. Nevertheless, if the better-educated women succeed in pre- senting themselves as models worthy of emulation, their example may en- courage new and beneficial forms of behavior. Perceptions of modern health care As I noted above, exogenous mortality decline can occur as the result ofeconomic development and the improvements it brings in individual in- comes and government investment in public health. Particularly in the early stages of development, however, such improvements are likely to be dis-MARK R. M ONTGOMERY 805 Click to return to Table of Contentstributed unevenly, with benefits conferred on some socioeconomic groups while others are left in isolation. Furthermore, although exogenous factors will remain important, deep declines in mortality almost surely require ac- cess to modern methods of disease prevention and cure. Access to thesemethods entails money, time, and social costs, so that if their use is to be widespread the benefits of modern methods must be commonly perceived to outweigh the costs. The perception-based motivations for modern health care use are therefore central to the endogenous aspects of mortality decline. In high-mortality, pretransitional societies, individuals engage in any number of preventive and curative health behaviors. The developmentsneeded to produce sustained mortality decline are, first, that these indi- vidual energies are redirected to the modern health system; and, second, that the modern system obtains the resources it needs to supply effectivehealth care. The two developments are, of course, closely related. In addi- tion, they are linked by potentially beneficial feedbacks. This discussion returns the focus to Figures 1 and 2, in which several factors involved in health decisionmaking were schematically presented. The concept that encompasses these figures is that of \"agency,\" a term that refers to the choice options available to a decisionmaker (e.g., the presenceof a vaccine option in Figure 2), the accessibility of these options (e.g., the costs c m in Figure 1), and the degree to which choices make a difference to outcomes (e.g., the differences among the mortality probabilities pm, pt, and pn of Figure 1). The concept of agency is central to much of the litera- ture on health decisionmaking, where it appears under various guises\u2014 internal locus of control (Higginbotham and Connor 1990; (Lundberg 1997, citing Antonovsky), and self- efficacy (Bandura 1988). It is an important feature of economic expected- utility models of health decisions and figures as well in the closely alliedhealth belief model (Becker et al. 1977) and the theory of reasoned action (see Vanlandingham et al. 1995). Conditional linkages to modern care In high-mortality societies the link between individual agency and use of modern health care can be weak or elusive, sometimes dependent on cir- cumstance and emerging only in certain stages of illness. Some illnessesfirst manifest themselves in a benign, everyday form that, even in pretransitional settings, allows considerable latitude for individual decision and experimentation. In the early stage of illness, modern health treat-ments can be employed along with various home or traditional remedies; the caretaker or afflicted individual is permitted some freedom in choosing among the options. If the illness progresses, however, understandings ofits root cause may also shift, and it may come to be recognized as the ex-806 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentspression of malevolent earthly or supernatural forces. Once the new inter- pretation is adopted, modern health treatments may be discarded as largely irrelevant. The locus of control may then pass from the individual to the wider social group, sometimes involving family elders and traditional heal-ers, who attempt to understand the full meaning of the illness and act ac- cordingly. Kirby (1997) describes the case of the Anufo of northern Ghana, whose vocabulary of illness distinguishes a \"cool\" or \"white\" stage of illness from a hotter or \"red\" stage and, as death approaches, a final \"black\" stage. These categories represent ways of ordering the interpretations of illness and al-low the Anufo to express their shared understandings of the causes and remedies that apply to a given stage. In the white stage of simple, everyday illness, individuals may experiment freely with Western and traditionalmedicines. But, as the illness worsens and enters the more serious red stage, Now everyone has a specific role to play and the entire process is orches- trated by the elders. Ill persons are no longer free to exercise their individual decisions in the matter, mothers are no longer free to take their children tothe clinic or to prepare amateur herbal treatments. All activities of self-help,characteristic of the pre-diagnostic [white] stage, cease. (Kirby 1997: 223) Although the transition from individual to collective action is not always so marked as in West Africa, a great number of societies show similar ten- dencies in classifying illnesses and tailoring responses.9 In many settings, illnesses such as neonatal tetanus and measles present symptoms that are immediately recognized as the expression of powerful external forces working against the child, its parents, or the community.Illnesses such as these will not naturally fall within the scope of the mod- ern health care system. In West Africa, a belief in \"spirit children\" (Feyisetan, Asa, and Ebigbola 1997) remains common: these are children who, be-cause of their circumstances of birth or distinctive early behavior, are un- derstood to be only tenuously linked to life and who may easily slip back into the other world. In other societies, such as in northeastern Brazil(Scheper-Hughes 1992), some children are thought to be born lacking suf- ficient will to survive. Through no one's fault, it is believed, they are un- likely to live and there is really nothing that can be done about it. These are situations in which social definitions limit the reach of modern health care. Extending the modern system's reach For the modern health care system to take a more prominent place in de- cisionmaking, it must first display its superior effectiveness in regard to either prevention of illness or cure, and the system must be organized toMARK R. M ONTGOMERY 807 Click to return to Table of Contentspermit access to care of adequate quality. How, then, does the modern sys- tem prove its effectiveness? To the layperson, what constitutes evidence? When is such evidence felt to be persuasive? Views of effectiveness are dependent on both individual and social experience, with each of these being filtered by perception. In health, the modern system proposes new causal explanations for illness and advances claims for new causal links between modern care and positive health out-comes. At least where treatment is concerned, one might think that a few rounds of exposure to the modern techniques would prove sufficient to sway any skeptics, leaving it incontrovertibly clear that the new methodswill improve survival. Yet, as discussed by McKenzie (1994) and Nisbett and Ross (1980), there are severe constraints on laypeople's abilities to detect such covariationin their immediate experience. The key concepts in covariation detection are those of \"distinctiveness,\" or the extent to which the outcome of inter- est is mainly observed in the presence of one cause, and \"consistency,\"which describes whether the outcome is always observed when the pro- posed cause is present. If such criteria are applied to health care, in which the link between treatment and response is necessarily probabilistic, theadvantages offered by the modern system may seem less than obvious. Af- ter all, sick children sometimes recover after being treated by a traditional healer, and not all children will thrive after receiving modern treatment.Potential users must learn to appreciate the higher recovery probabilities associated with use of modern care, a task that may call for finer powers of discrimination than they possess. Selectivity biases associated with the costsof access to modern care may further cloud the picture. When the modern system imposes high fees for its services or access is delayed by time and travel costs, children may not be brought to the clinic until their condi-tions are too far advanced for simple treatments\u2014or any modern care\u2014to be effective. Understandings of modern preventive health care, in which behavior and outcome are separated in time, may prove even more diffi-cult to achieve. Perceptual difficulties are especially likely if long-established health beliefs act so as to screen the proposed new relationship from view. In somesettings, the relative ineffectiveness of traditional health care may be well disguised, for as Nisbett and Ross write, ...objectively low or nonexistent covariations can be parlayed into massive perceived covariations through a priori theories and assumptions. ... ...Unexpected, true covariations can sometimes be detected, but they will be underestimated and are likely to be noticed only when the covariation is808 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentsvery strong, and the relevant data set excludes 'decoy' features that bring into play popular but incorrect theories. (1980: 97, 109) In a society with coherent and internally consistent traditional beliefs about the origins of illness, appropriate means of prevention, and routes to cure, modern health care may initially struggle to make a persuasive case (Cald- well, Reddy, and Caldwell 1983). The difficulties facing advocates of the modern system should not be exaggerated, however. Most societies have seen a good deal of inter-pen- etration of modern and traditional health systems (e.g., Pitts et al. 1996;Haddad et al. 1998). The layperson's understanding of health is often loosely organized, and in many settings individuals seem to adopt eclectic and im- provisatory approaches. Bierlich describes health decisions in northernGhana as follows: People make use of both local and Western medicines, without knowing or being committed to the technical or philosophical premises of one or the other medical system. People are generally uncertain about the cause and outcome of illness and often act in advance of evidence about its cause. Theirpractices are not homogeneous, but diverse or 'un-systematized,' and highlyinnovative. Their approach to treatment shows itself in their general readi-ness to experiment with all kinds of medicine, simultaneously or serially. Medicines, local and Western, are used in a trial-and-error manner. If one does not produce the desired result, another medicine is tried instead. 'Weare just trying,' people say. (1995: 505) Such fluidity is also noted by Ryan (1998) and Cantrelle and Locoh (1990), who mention the practice of double consultations for illnesses that mightbe seen to have either a natural or a spiritual cause. In settings such as these, the modern health care system can seize upon opportunities to associate its methods with the traditional vocabu-lary and understanding of health. Kirby (1997) notes that Western medi- cines can be associated with the \"white\" or \"cool\" initial stages of illness to encourage timely use. Vaccines can be described as strengthening the pro-tection already being provided by amulets (Findley 1990; Nichter 1995); injections can be likened to beneficial fluids in settings where good health is thought to require a balance of positive and negative fluids (Bastien 1995);and oral medications can be left unsweetened and bitter to underscore the point that they are powerful. Of course, the mapping of traditional labels onto modern methods will often prove to be imprecise (Gove and Pelto 1994). The consequences of such mis-mapping have been explored by Nichter (1990, 1995) in re- gard to community views of vaccination campaigns in South Asia. Nichter'sresearch illustrates the consequences stemming from folk labels that areMARK R. M ONTGOMERY 809 Click to return to Table of Contentstoo broad in relation to the specific protective powers of a given vaccine. Suppose that the local label covers a cluster of illnesses with similar symp- toms, with the vaccine being effective against only one illness in the clus- ter. This can lead to instances of apparent vaccine failure, which wouldundermine confidence in the vaccine's efficacy and cast doubt on the claims of health personnel. 10 The modern system may succeed in conveying the simple and general message that vaccines are good for health, but then failto clearly differentiate these vaccines. In consequence, the local popula- tion may come to believe that vaccines are all very much alike. Parents may lack motivation to comply with the full regimen for any one vaccineand may not grasp why they should keep track of the number of vaccina- tions of a particular type a child has received. This, too, can lead to cases of apparent vaccine failure. The matching of modern methods to folk concepts is therefore not a simple task. Fortunately, the widespread use of modern health care does not require the local population to discern the root causes of illness in thesame way as their Western-influenced health providers. Disparities in the understanding of causes are not necessarily inconsistent with use of the modern system (Feyisetan, Asa, and Ebigbola 1997; Cleland 1990; Raharjoand as Cleland (1990) argues, health-related be- havior is likely to change faster than underlying cultural beliefs about root causes. What matters is that the modern system is perceived to be effectiveand that it has the resources needed to deliver on its promises. Social and political agency As the modern health sector's potential advantages gradually become clari- fied, so, too, will many of that sector's limitations. Continuing shortages of medicine, high fees and long waits, the intermittent presence of key per- sonnel, the abusive or condescending treatment of patients\u2014all these willbe exposed as the population comes into increasing contact with clinics and hospitals. Having been persuaded of the theoretical superiority of West- ern medicines, people may nevertheless avoid the modern system becauseof its higher social and monetary costs. In successful transitions, this tension is eventually resolved with the emergence of new forms of social and political agency with respect to health.The concept of equity begins to be applied to the distribution of state-con- trolled health resources, and, with it, the definition of a right to press de- mands on the state for resource provision. Local, regional, and nationalpolitical networks may evolve and provide a forum for voicing such de- mands. Such new political dialogue can eventually succeed in redirecting governmental priorities and improving the quality of health systems. Whengroups succeed in drawing the attention of the state to their needs, this may further enhance the sense of individual agency on the part of their810 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentsmembers, generating a kind of beneficial feedback. A number of accounts, both historical and contemporary, have emphasized the importance of such social and political dynamics (Dye and Smith 1986; Caldwell 1986; Lindenbaum 1990; Ewbank Walle and van deWalle 1990; Preston and Haines 1991). The record of the United States from the late eighteenth to early twen- tieth centuries provides one case in point. Dye and Smith (1986), drawingtheir evidence from women's diaries, find in this period that the possibility of child death was an ever-present concern. Vinovskis (1991), using simi- lar materials, argues that mortality perceptions were likely to have beeninflated in relation to the empirical realities. He locates one source of this exaggeration in the influence of religious institutions and the social em- phasis attached to funerals. Yet, with mortality still high, and even before the advent of modern medicine in the last years of the nineteenth century, a shift in the scope of personal agency began. The key change was that, over the century, child-rearing responsibilities were increasingly assigned to mothers, rather than being distributed among various kin and caretakers as in the earlier era (Dye and Smith 1986). As mothers began to be entrusted with the task ofsafeguarding their children, and as good mothering began to be defined in these terms, the lack of any truly effective medical care led to tensions between the newly assigned social roles and the limited health care op-tions. Until the very end of the century, these socially defined obligations could not always be properly discharged; the result was mounting anxiety and a sense of frustrated personal agency. When the medical breakthroughs were finally made, women re- sponded in both personal and political terms (Dye and Smith 1986; Ewbank and Preston 1990; Preston and Haines 1991). In personal terms, they en-thusiastically adopted the new medical techniques of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and were attentive to and adhered to ad- vice. In the political sphere, activists channeled collective energies to thecreation of the Children's Bureau, supported local conferences and instruc- tion for young mothers and girls, and aided other government and public health institutions. Thanks to the prevailing levels of literacy, pamphletsand even newspapers helped to diffuse information. The foregoing account of the US experience illustrates more general themes that have been given little research attention by demographers.The American case raises the issue of perception of mortality risks, as against the empirical risks themselves. It underscores the distinction between high risks and risks that, although still high at the end of the nineteenth cen-tury, were increasingly believed to be controllable. The key role was played by new health care options that emerged at the dawn of the twentieth century, with support from new germ theories that gradually supplantedthe older notions based on miasmas, sewer gases, and the like. LiteracyMARK R. M ONTGOMERY 811 Click to return to Table of Contentshelped to spread the new ideas among women; but also important was the diffusion of information between public health practitioners, on the one side, and a sometimes reluctant medical profession, on the other (Preston and Haines 1991). The mix of personal, institutional, and political responsesis not unique to the United States\u2014Caldwell (1986) presents a similar ac- count of the factors involved in mortality decline in Kerala. Mortality decline and the quantity-quality transition Where both mortality and fertility have been high, to adopt a new strategy of family limitation is to embark on a risky course of innovation, one that will often lack clear social guidance and normative support. Few people insuch circumstances would be likely to experience criticism by adhering to the status quo. Potential innovators might be deterred by the prospect of child loss, even if they suspect that mortality rates are lower than theywere in the past. They might feel unable to proceed without additional confirmation of their views and may therefore delay until very sure of the lower risks. Such conservatism in risk-taking is predicted by a number of theories in psychology and economics. Experimental research on prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) seems to have uncovered a fundamentalasymmetry in how choices are made under risk It appears that decisionmakers often behave as if they are more fear-ful of potential losses than attracted by potential gains. In addition, at least according to some psychologists (Mellers, Schwartz, and Coale 1998), re- gret is felt more keenly following decisions to act rather than to accept thestatus quo. This literature suggests that the anticipation of regret is an un- der-appreciated factor in decisionmaking. If such findings can be extrapolated to the case at hand, they would suggest that new strategies of fertility limitation, insofar as they are moti- vated by lower mortality, should not be expected to appear on the heels of mortality decline. Potential innovators risk feeling regret should their newstrategy fail, and they may also face social sanctions and criticism from family elders and others who never saw the need to deviate from the status quo. To buttress their own positions and fend off such attacks, innovators mayneed incontrovertible evidence of lower mortality risks before they proceed. Fertility control: Transition and insurance effects In high-mortality, pretransitional societies, fertility decisionmaking is some- times described as being passive or even \"fatalistic.\" More accurately, per- haps, it can be seen as the result of a rational stance vis-\u00e0-vis an uncertain812 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of Contentsenvironment, in which the pervasiveness of uncertainty means that deci- sionmaking must be reactive and highly contingent. As child survival be- comes increasingly assured, a different form of decisionmaking is permit- ted to emerge, one that involves forward-looking strategies that play outover longer time horizons. Parents may then begin to entertain the possi- bility of influencing the size of their own families, instead of leaving such matters to chance or to higher powers. As the number of children beginsto assume importance as a decision option, so, too, do new forms of in- vestment in children that would have been dismissed previously as too risky. Lloyd and Ivanov (1988) have described this transition as a shift fromfamily-building by fate to family-building by design. As it becomes useful to consider controlling the number of children, the perceived level of mortality may then begin to exert influence on thedesired number. This is the essence of the insurance effect (Preston 1978; Wolpin 1998), which in its simplest form posits an inverse relationship be- tween the probability of child survival and the desired number of births.As the articles in Preston (1978) and Montgomery and Cohen (1998) show, it has proven difficult to test the insurance hypothesis. Some authors have taken the level of mortality in the community, variously defined, to be theempirical counterpart to mortality risks as they are perceived by individual decisionmakers. The discussion above suggests that the association between such empirical measures and the subjective risks may well be weak. If so,then alternative measures of perceptions may be required, a point to which I return in the concluding section. Capital investment Few economists now question the importance of human capital accumu- lation to economic development. Yet, it is difficult to isolate the role of mortality decline in promoting human capital investments. After all, thevast majority of child deaths occur among children who have not yet reached school age. How, then, can schooling investments be directly af- fected by mortality decline? As Preston (1980: 324-326) showed, the mor-tality risks facing children in adolescence and the early adult years are rela- tively low even in high-mortality environments. From the viewpoint of the child who is old enough to embark on a school career, improvementsin survivorship could have little effect on the private rate of return to school- ing. 11 The direct impact of mortality decline would therefore seem to be small. Several indirect links, however, warrant consideration. First, high- mortality settings are often characterized by high morbidity. Morbidity may be associated with delayed entry to school, interrupted attendance, and eroded abilities to learn (Behrman 1996; Alderman et al. 1997). All thesewill tend to reduce the payoffs to schooling and thereby reduce the moti-MARK R. M ONTGOMERY 813 Click to return to Table of Contentsvation for parents to invest in it. A second possibility is that if the insur- ance mechanism is operative, higher mortality risks will be associated with higher fertility, with the result that in a typical household more young siblings may be present who will need care. Child care and related house-hold responsibilities may then divert children's time and attention from school, particularly for girls, and this may undermine abilities to learn and lower the returns to further schooling. In this case, mortality decline\u2014if itis accompanied by some fertility decline\u2014could raise the net benefits of schooling. A third mechanism involves adult mortality. Environments with high infant and child mortality are also characterized by high adult mortality, and parents may well hold exaggerated views of adult mortality risks. Since it is parents, rather than children themselves, who finance human capitalinvestment in developing countries, the parental time horizons and per- ceptions of risk are key factors in determining whether the investments are made. In many developing countries, fathers take on much of the bur-den of paying school fees and associated charges. Particularly where sub- stantial age gaps separate husband and wife, the fathers of school-age chil- dren may often be of middle age themselves, entering a period in whichtheir risks of mortality are felt to be appreciable. They may well be reluc- tant to embark on ambitious programs of human capital investment in their children, given the possibility that the child's schooling might have to betruncated in the event of a parent's death. Even if a child's schooling can be completed, the time span during which the parents can expect to enjoy some returns will depend on adult mortality risks. Thus, when seen fromthe viewpoint of parents, perceived improvements in adult survivorship may considerably enhance the motivation for investing in children. Little is known about adult perceptions of older-age mortality risks, but in recent years a small literature has emerged exploring the issues in the United States. Two studies have examined the fit between the survival perceptions of the elderly and the actuarial risks as summarized in periodlife tables. Hurd and McGarry (1995) drew upon the innovative measures of mortality perceptions that are being collected in the Health and Retire- ment Study. In their investigation, considering a highly literate populationthat is well supplied with information from pension and insurance sys- tems, Hurd and McGarry found surprisingly good agreement between the subjective and objective measures. However, Mirowsky (1999), using less-refined questions from a different US survey, saw evidence of systematic differences between subjective expectations of years of life remaining and the actuarial counterparts. His results suggested that unexplained factorsassociated with race and socioeconomic status cause some groups to be unduly pessimistic about their survival prospects. Regrettably, no studies such as these seem to have been carried out in developing countries.814 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of ContentsMuch of the motivation for measuring old-age mortality perceptions in the Health and Retirement Study stemmed from a need to understand the determinants of financial savings. In developing countries, the expan- sion in parental time horizons brought about by lower adult mortality maywell encourage financial savings. Lee, Mason, and Miller (2000), consider- ing the case of Taiwan, show that the expected ratio of postretirement years to working years can increase greatly with mortality decline. This can sub-stantially enhance the motivations for private savings. Through routes such as these, recognition of lower child mortality and improved adult survivorship might increase the returns to investmentin both human and physical capital. The prospects for greater returns in these dimensions could undermine much of the rationale for continued high fertility. In traditional settings, an important role for children is toserve as a form of savings: they embody parental claims upon future trans- fers from family. If mortality decline is accompanied by the emergence of better-developed financial systems and improved payoffs to financial andhuman capital investment, educated children and monetized savings might come to be seen as more effective instruments than numbers of children alone. Conclusions: A new agenda A main theme in this discussion has been the need to appreciate the many perceptual difficulties and biases that hinder people's understandings of social change and retard their demographic responses. Poorly equipped as they are to sort through the issues, individuals will probably be slow torecognize improvements in child and adult survival, whether these are linked to exogenous developments or to the new opportunities presented by modern health care. Without some assistance\u2014from family, social net-works, the better-educated, and health programs and policies\u2014individuals will then be reluctant to disengage their energies from traditional forms of demographic behavior and to embark on risky courses of innovation. Al-though demographic research can offer no definitive proof, it is reasonable to think that the well-documented lags in the fertility response to mortal- ity decline have much to do with the role of these perceptions and beliefs.The essence of the familiar insurance effect can be found in the complex of individuals' beliefs about the nature of the external environment they face, their sense of agency and ability to control that environment, and theirunderstanding of the operation of cause and effect in health. A second theme is that mortality decline can set in motion a series of reinforcing responses, with the long-term result being that higher survi-vorship becomes associated with a lower net reproduction rate. Little is known about the full causal chain or the important demographic and eco- nomic mechanisms that could generate such beneficial feedbacks. I haveargued that both children's schooling and financial savings can be posi-MARK R. M ONTGOMERY 815 Click to return to Table of Contentstively influenced by mortality decline and that capital formation will have broader benefits for economic development. It is at least possible that such feedbacks serve to link mortality decline to economic growth. The discussion has taken mortality decline to be the dominant em- pirical phenomenon, but in some countries the prevalence of HIV infec- tion will soon bring a halt to further declines and may sharply increase both adult and child death rates. The sheer scale of the impending losses inparts of Africa and the inability of the modern health system to mount an effective response, when coupled with the personal shame and stigma that accompany the infection, will likely bring about a profound confusion inbeliefs. Individual time horizons, once lengthened by the prospect of lower mortality, will inevitably be pushed back toward the present; motivations for saving, schooling, and other future-oriented behavior may be seriouslyundermined. The current state of demographic research permits very few of the effects that I have described to be quantified. Standard survey-based mea-sures of perceptions will eventually be required, but these are probably not the tools to deploy first. Although the recent survey efforts in the United States appear promising (Hurd and McGarry 1995; Manski and Straub 2000;Mirowsky 1999), much work is required to devise appropriate measures for studies set in developing countries. Even semistructured individual in- terviews would need to be carefully crafted to accommodate local beliefs,vocabularies, and ways of thinking about probability and risk. In few set- tings will adults be able to articulate why they feel as they do about mor- tality risks; nor can they often trace for the interviewer's benefit the connec-tions they see between mortality risks and fertility or schooling decisions. Thus, even a program of qualitative investigation would be required to break new methodological ground. A systematic approach to these issues is well overdue.

This research was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. 1 Of course, the mortality probabilities pn, pt, and pm and the costs ct and cm will depend on the severity of the child's illness. The costs might have multiple dimensions, including travel time, monetary outlays, and various so- cial \"transactions costs\" that arise, for example, from the need to negotiate with a spouse or family decisionmaker about health outlays. 2 To integrate such factors, the mortality probabilities and costs could be representedwith a government policy index g and a time index t, yielding, for example, pm(g,t) for the modern care mortality probability and cm(g,t) for the cost of modern care. 3 There is a formal mechanism available\u2014 Bayesian analysis\u2014for taking such uncertainties into account. I have argued elsewhere (see Mont- gomery 1998) that to simply recast the deci- sion problem in Bayesian terms is inadequate. 4I present here only a sketch of the argu- ments; see Montgomery (1998) for more de- tail. 5 Lloyd and Ivanov (1988) note that as survivorship improves, the changing age pat-816 PERCEIVING MORTALITY DECLINE Click to return to Table of ContentsReferences Alderman, Harold, Jere R. school A longitudinal analysis,\" unpublished pa- per, World Bank.

What We Know About Health Transition: The Cultural,tern of risk helps to distinguish the relatively high-risk period of infancy from the post- infancy period in which survival is almost as- sured. In this way, as mortality decline pro- ceeds a dividing line emerges that helps to draw attention to the fact of survival, making it easier to recognize survival itself as a note- worthy event. 6 Although it might be thought that an averaging process would eliminate individual errors of observation when opinions are ex- changed in larger groups, studies of group dy- namics do not consistently support this con- tention. See Montgomery and Casterline (1996) and the references cited therein. 7 LeVine and colleagues (LeVine et al. 1994; Stuebing 1997) have argued that school- ing provides individuals with the cognitive skills they need to translate the \"decontextual- ized\" language of the formal health care sec- tor into terms that are meaningful to individual experience. 8 It can be argued (see National Research Council 1993: Chapter 4) that the long reach of networks in West Africa is itself the out- growth of a need for social mechanisms of in- surance and support, given the great uncer- tainties of the natural environment.9 See Bastien (1995) Bhuiya, Streatfield, and Meyer (1990) for Bangladesh; Bierlich (1995) and Gyapong et al.

(1996) for Thailand; and Sholkamy (1996) for Egypt. 10 Nichter (1995) notes that traditional healers often draw fine distinctions among sub- categories of illness and emphasize that their methods are effective against only some of these. The modern system might try to make the same distinctions and arguments to clarify its comparative advantage. 11 Private rates of return are typically on the order of 12-15 percent; see Montgomery, Arends-Kuenning, and Mete (2000) for a re- cent review. According to Preston's calcula- tions, mortality decline would increase the rate of return by about one percentage point in a typical case.MARK R.

Jean-Baptiste Moheau, the author of a treatise, published in 1778 under the title Recherches et consid\u00e9rations sur la population de la France , was an exception to this rule. He seems to have been an obscure bureaucrat, and left so few tracks in the record that his very existence was long in doubt. Today, however, the rough outlines of a biog-raphy have been traced. Moheau was born in 1745, and died in 1794; he was not thirty years old when he wrote the treatise. He made no other contribution to sci- ence, and appears to have been unwilling even to make simple corrections to his textwhen changes were requested by the 1780 German translator of the work. (There exists no translation in English.) He was the personal secretary of Montyon, the Intendant (the equivalent of a provincial governor, delegated by the central gov- ernment) of the g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 of La Rochelle on the Atlantic coast of France. There is still a controversy about Montyon's possible contribution to the work, but it appears that Montyon was not interested in population, that he was not even in residence inLa Rochelle, and that Moheau as his secretary was substituting for him, taking a special interest in the collection of population statistics that were requested by the royal administration. At the time of publication, the work attracted some attention, including an unfavorable critique by Condorcet, and had some admirers in Germany where it was compared to the work of S\u00fcssmilch, the great Prussian political arithmetician,whose own G\u00f6ttliche Ordnung (The Divine Order , first edition published in 1741) was unknown to the author or authors of the Recherches et consid\u00e9rations . Moheau's work was soon forgotten, however, until a 1912 re-edition. A moderncritical edition, annotated by Eric Vilquin, which contains a biographical essay by Ren\u00e9 LeM\u00e9e and a number of other contributions assessing the work and placing it in its historical context, was published in 1994 jointly by the Institut National822 ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of Contentsd'\u00c9tudes D\u00e9mographiques and Presses Universitaires de France. The excerpt printed below and the citations in this introduction are translations from the text as it ap- pears in that edition. The translation is by Etienne van de Walle. Page numbers also refer to the 1994 edition. Recherches et consid\u00e9rations sur la population de la France , in any event, is a remarkable achievement for its time and deserves an important place in the history of demography. The title could be roughly translated, today, as \"EmpiricalStudies on the Population of France, and Their Interpretation.\" Like John Graunt's 1662 Natural and Political Observations...made upon the Bills of Mortality , the work is characterized by a dual concern to present hard data and to use them tomake politically and socially relevant inferences. Moheau's book consists of two very different parts, however, and lexicographical analysis suggests that they were writ- ten by two authors. The first part (\"State of the Population\") is a demographic mono-graph, and one is struck by the similarities of the chapter titles to those that one would find in any demographic description of a national population today: - The means of investigating the population - An estimate of the population of France - Distribution by age and sex - Distribution by socioeconomic characteristics- Body size and strength - Fertility - Mortality- Migration - Is the population growing or decreasing? The main demographic contribution of the work is in the area of fertility. Moheau lists the topics himself: A multitude of interesting questions present themselves for our investigation. What is the fertility of women in France? One in how many women gives birth per year? What is the ratio of marriages to births, and what is the highest number of children per marriage? Isfertility the same in all provinces of France, in the cities and in the countryside, and in thevarious parts of Europe? Is the result roughly the same every year, or every month? Andfinally, which of the two sexes accounts for the most births? (p. 125) This is a remarkable list of questions, and Moheau was the first to raise them so comprehensively. (It is noteworthy that there was not even a word in English, at that time, to express the concept of fertility as an aggregate characteristic of popula-tions.) He distinguishes fertility from what we now call the birth rate, and marital fertility from overall fertility. He is interested in variability in space\u2014national and international, and urban and rural. He analyzes the seasonality of births. He alsoconcludes that fertility is constant over the years: \"Nature has arranged the fertility of women in such a way that each year gives approximately the same number ofJEAN-BAPTISTE MOHEAU 823 Click to return to Table of Contentsbirths\" (p. 134). The result of this constancy is that, in the absence of a census, the number of registered births provides the best estimate of the population size of a country. This view conflicts with the idea of fertility decline, and with potential de- population as expressed later in the volume and in the passage below. The second part of the book examines the causes of the progress or decay of the population. This is the part described by the word \" consid\u00e9rations \" in the title of the book. The author distinguishes between physical causes (climate, food, danger-ous occupations...) and political, social, or moral causes. Among the latter factors, he discusses the effects of law, government, religion, taxes, war, and the possession of colonies. The excerpt translated below is entitled \" Des moeurs \" (literally: \"Of Mo- res\"), by which Moheau means private morality in the areas of sexuality and repro- duction; this is not unlike the meaning adopted by Malthus when he speaks of \"moral restraint.\" The chapter deals mainly with four areas of sexual conduct: marital fi-delity, prostitution, breastfeeding, and nonmarital sex (which may occasion vene- real diseases). A specially noteworthy passage alludes to funestes secrets (fatal se- crets), an expression widely quoted by French demographers and often interpretedas a reference to the spread of contraception in marriage. In context, however, it would appear that Moheau had in mind the growing impact of various types of extramarital behavior\u2014fornication, prostitution, and adultery. But beyond offering a catalogue of individual behavior he considers reprehen- sible\u2014a sharp-eyed critical description of some aspects of contemporary French mo- res\u2014Moheau's central concern in these matters is with the consequences that affectthe strength of the State. Moral failings, he argues, lead to diminished fertility and damage the overall physical quality of the population; they are pernicious in the civil and political order. He notes the high economic costs of children and impliesthat economic calculus alone would result in failure to reproduce: \"logic and a cal- culating mind would not lead to the propagation of the species.\" Populousness of the State presupposes motivations that transcend material interest: it rests on the foun-dation of moral virtues. It is an acknowledged truth that there is no well-organized Empire with- out morality. But the proposition is equally true that, without morality, there can be no prospect of a numerous population. A nation endowed with morality, independent of religion, law, and even public opinion, possesses principles of justice, virtue, honesty, and generosity. These are the traits men must have to insure the populousnessof a State. If only material interests were at stake, in none of the orders, occupa- tions, or trades would the multiplication of children constitute an increaseof wealth. People have children because of a natural drive, and raise them out of love. But a reckoning of the burden they entail would demonstrate that, among the laboring classes, a child, before he is able to be useful, hascost much more than the wages of a grown and able man. In the other824 ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of Contentsclasses of society, children impose on their parents the burden of giving them an education and an establishment. When they are grown, they leave and sometimes cause them unhappiness through their disorderly conduct and their vices. Thus, logic and a calculating mind would not lead to thepropagation of the species. Motivations that transcend interest, the renun- ciation of wealth and luxury, and a sense of principled responsibility must exist to persuade one to assume this domestic burden. The love and obedi-ence of children must also offer a prospect of happiness for parents in their old age. These feelings and dispositions are the result of morality. Morality, in keeping man away from libertine behavior, is necessary to multiply the number of marriages. If things were arranged in such a way that a man could have sensual relations with a woman only by being married, the attraction for each of the sexes to such a union would be cer-tainly stronger and more active; there would be fewer persons who are celibate and fewer marriages where the spouses, in contravention to their vows and to the wishes of nature, would behave as if they were celibate. Asingle girl who abandons herself to a forbidden relation will not add to the population, because debauchery does not breed; and she spoils the chances of the honest girl who would have had a husband if the enticement oflibertinism had not taken him away from her. Let it not be assumed that illicit pairings will compensate the State. They are never as prolific as the unions approved by law and whose fruitscan see the light of day without dishonoring their author. We have seen earlier that the ratio of births to marriages exceeds four to one in France. This means that every married woman contributes more than four indi-viduals to the State and that, if one of them is less fertile, another will provide more. But what single girl or libertine widow has a similar ratio for the benefit of the State? Persons addicted to prostitution breed no chil-dren; they avoid them as an obstacle to their trade. Seduced single girls and widows who have renounced chastity have not always renounced feel- ings of shame, so they fear fertility as a testimony to their lost honor. Hence,out of two thousand single girls or widows who have illicit liaisons, there is not one who has two children. Moreover, great are the dangers to which these children are exposed! Before their birth, their mothers often have homicidal designs against them: pity their fate if their mothers are knowledgeable in the art of precocious murder. The secret birth of these children imposes precautions that may,and often do, threaten their survival. It is in vain that the law condemns to death the girl whose child has perished, if she had not declared her fault to a judge. In order to avoid shame, she confronts the danger, and sometimescommits the crime, and an overly rigorous law remains ineffective. These children, handed over to the care of strangers from the moment of their birth to the time when they can survive on their own, and deprived oftheir mother's care because she cannot visit them without betraying her-JEAN-BAPTISTE MOHEAU 825 Click to return to Table of Contentsself and deplores their birth more than their demise, are exposed to infi- nite dangers. Their mortality exceeds by far that of their age mates, and it can be estimated that illicit relations between the sexes do not yield a twen- tieth of the number of adults that are produced by those unions that arepublicly recognized and authorized by law. If libertinism enters marriages and corrupts them, these unions lose their security and their greatest appeal. Who would accept the burden of awife if another man shares her affection? When fatherhood becomes sus- pect and uncertain, what man would submit himself to the most forbid- ding of all taxations, that of supporting the needs of a large family? Whatever allurement, whatever semblance of skill and talent, what- ever ridiculous point of honor the easy mores of the nation and the cor- ruption of the times have associated with the seduction of women, it re-mains that anyone who disturbs the peace of a marriage engages in an action that is vicious and reprehensible in the moral order, and pernicious in the civil and political order. If one consults the men whom religion has assigned to be deposito- ries of the secrets of the hearts and of the foibles of mankind, or consults those whom a taste for the physical investigations that are important forthe welfare of the State has made into accurate observers of the mores of country people and paupers, they will tell you that rich women, for whom pleasure is the greatest interest and the sole occupation, are not the onlyones who regard the propagation of the species as a dupery of olden times; already the fatal secrets unknown to any animal but man have penetrated in the countryside: nature gets cheated even in the villages. If these licentious practices, if these homicidal tastes spread more, they will be no less fatal to the State than the plagues that devastated it in the past. It is time to stop this secret and terrible cause of depopulation that stealthilyundermines the nation; it might soon be too late to control it. To forestall these disasters, the only, the sole means is the restoration of morality. Even among virtuous women, there are many who are kept busy by their frivolous tastes, neglecting the duties that are a consequence of the married state. They believe that the example of others and custom justify this. But they are wrong, they betray their duties as citizens, as wives, andas mothers. To abandon a child to nursing by a stranger is a cruel and un- natural act, and if it were rare it would be considered an atrocity; the mul- tiplicity of the culprits does not diminish its perversity.* *It has been asserted that three children out of fifteen nursed by their mothers die, whereas among the same number entrusted to a wet nurse, five die. The latter estimate does not seem correct, and if it is the result of some actual observations, these must have been related to foundlings, who are often in a weakenedstate of health and whose poorly chosen wet nurses gave them care as inadequate as are their wages, so that the natural order of things was disturbed. In any case, it is certain that natural milk is most healthy, and that mercenary care cannot replace that of nature. Given that infanticide is a horrible crime, what opinion mustwe have toward a woman who risks committing it by abandoning her children? Although this type of murder sheds no blood and is not carried out by wielding a knife, what matter the means if the result is the same?826 ARCHIVES Click to return to Table of ContentsNature that was cheated avenges itself and inflicts a penalty; milk, which ought to be the nourishment of children, becomes, for the mothers who deprive them of it, an instrument of sickness and death. The children who have been banished from their mother's arms from the beginning of their lives, and have been removed from the sight of their parents to acquire knowledge rather than moral values, know only by hear- say who the authors of their being are. Soon they will be separated bytheir respective personal obligations, and the main relation that will re- main between them will be that of a creditor and a debtor. From such a disposition, from feelings so perverted, and from families so organized, nodevotion to the propagation of the species should be expected. Moreover, how many people are there in France from whom little help can be expected to add to the population? How many men are ener-vated by debauchery and prematurely aged in their youth? Their bodies are without strength, their souls are without desire at the very moment when the elementary fire of generation should be felt for the first time. It is not clear whether this class of men should be exhorted or forbid- den to breed. The greatest number of them is infected by this terrible dis- ease, which, thanks to the advances of medicine, is no longer deadly, butis still destructive of the human species by weakening its strengths and shortening the days of its life. And even if the children do not at birth carry the punishment for the fault of their parents, their breed is feebleand diminished and constitutes a bastardized generation, impoverished and degraded, and much inferior to the breed of men that is produced in the countryside.POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 26(4) (DECEMBER 2000) 827BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsVACLAV SMIL Feeding the World: A Challenge for the Twenty-First Century Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 2000. xxviii + 360 p. $32.95. Vaclav Smil's Feeding the World: A Challenge for the Twenty-First Century is one of the best new volumes on the world's food situation in some time. The book is a truereflection of its author\u2014broad, deep, and occasionally brash. It will prove usefulas a reference guide for informed laypersons and also as a text\u2014primary or supple-mental\u2014in world-food courses at the undergraduate or master's level. This vol-ume, read together with the biennial food reviews of the International Food PolicyResearch Institute, will take anyone interested in the world's food very far, very fast. Feeding the World is a sizable volume that covers the nature of current food problems; the scientific underpinnings of food production, including their envi-ronmental implications; a delineation of the various resource bases that serve ag-riculture; the basics of food consumption, diets, and nutrition; the role of animal products; an assessment of postharvest losses; and an analysis of China's futurecapacity to feed itself. Sprinkled liberally throughout the book are Smil's own viewson the world food scene and his views of the various authors who write about it.His perspective is shaped by the needs of developing countries and by the prob-lems of undernutrition. The book's greatest strength is Smil's capacity to pull together relevant mate- rials from the physical and social sciences in ways that both delineate the impor-tant questions and suggest sensible answers. The volume is informed geography atits best. Readers will appreciate especially Smil's systems approach to food issues\u2014from photosynthesis to ecosystem services, from production to consumption, andfrom traditional crops to aquaculture. Smil takes particular delight in skewering other writers in the field. He saves his most devastating comments for the pessimists, and his final chapter on feedingChina is, in some sense, a rebuttal to Lester Brown, with whom he has dueled foryears. On occasion, Smil is unfair in citing older, more extreme points of view ofauthors, rather than their more modulated recent views. (Even Malthus changedhis mind, although he too is rarely given credit by anyone for having done so.)Although Smil promises to attack the cornucopians as much as the catastrophists,he does not really do so, and his own view can be described as being reasonablyoptimistic. \"Rationalizing animal food production\" (Chapter 5) is a particularly useful con- tribution that moves questions about meat from the realm of moral imperatives tothe world of empirical relationships. His discussion of energy requirements is bal-anced, and he avoids the use of an energy theory of value in evaluating the worthof animal products. He also provides a very useful section on the food-securitydimensions of aquaculture\u2014an increasingly important source of food, but also asignificant source of demand for feed from both marine and terrestrial systems.828 PDR 26(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsAlthough Feeding the World is a very good book, it might have been even bet- ter. Smil's data are both recent and well assembled. In what should have been avolume filled with colorful charts and illustrations, there are instead only drabgraphics for which MIT Press must surely bear primary responsibility. This flaw ismore than just cosmetic, for it lessens considerably the value of the volume as areference. Readers will be disappointed that Smil is conspicuously quiet on the biotech- nology revolution and what it might do for food security in developing nations;indeed, this omission may be the most serious shortcoming of the book. Quiteclearly, modern biotechnology (for example, the use of molecular markers) is radi-cally altering the speed at which conventional plant breeding can be accomplished.Moreover, the ability to sequence, clone, and move genes across species opensgreat new horizons for dealing with the biotic and abiotic stresses that often pre-vail in regions containing large numbers of impoverished people. Given the con-troversies that now surround genetically modified organisms (GMOs), readers arethe poorer for not having Smil's judgments on how best to balance possible eco-system risks against the imperative of increased food production for many regionsof the world; on labeling issues and consumers' rights to know; and on appropri-ate regulatory systems for GMOs in poor countries. More generally, Feeding the World is a synthesis of Smil's prior research on food issues, rather than a vehicle for exploring new technologies and altered institutions. Smil spends less time on globalization issues than might have been expected. Another green revolution is called for by Smil, given his (sensible) assertion thatyields will have to grow by at least 2 percent annually to meet projected increasesin demand. On the other hand, the patenting of new germplasm technology and arestructuring of the global seed industry are likely to have negative effects on theability of the poorest developing countries to gain access to modern agriculturaltechnology. New provisos under international biosafety conventions are also likelyto interrupt the flow of genetic materials among countries. Issues of this sort aresimply not addressed by Smil. Global changes and their implications for agriculture are recurring themes of Feeding the World . Smil's discussion is consistently good on these topics; yet in sev- eral places readers will yearn for more details. The section on biodiversity repre-sents such a case. The 1992 Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) has significantlysnarled the transfer of agricultural-seed technologies. The CBD reaffirms nationalownership of genetic materials, but provides only a very muddled definition of avariety's \"distinctive properties.\" Numerous countries believe (almost alwayswrongly) that their varieties are worth genetic fortunes. Yet no principles are pro-vided in the CBD on how countries are to be compensated for various genes ortraits. This problem is illustrated well by the VEERY line of wheat, one of the mostpopular wheat varieties in the world. It is the product of 3,170 crosses involving51 parents from 26 countries\u2014an indication of both the scientific and administra-tive difficulties of applying the CBD to food crops. Since Smil is writing about \"theworld,\" details of this sort would have usefully added political-economy perspec-tives to his international assessments. Whether Smil has, in fact, produced a volume that provides an \"unprejudiced reality check\" (p. 21) may be in the eye of the beholder. But he has produced a read-BOOK REVIEWS PDR 26(4 )829 Click to return to Table of Contentsable, interesting, and useful volume that will certainly help to inform the discussion about feeding a world that seems likely to contain some 9 billion people by 2050. Stanford University WALTER P. F ALCON ROBERT WILLIAM FOGEL The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2000. 383 p. $25.00. In this book, economic historian Robert W. Fogel joins forces with those who seeAmerica turning from materialism to the pursuit of self-realization, \"the fullestdevelopment of the virtuous aspects of one's nature\" (p. 204, emphasis in origi- nal). Like two of his economist predecessors, John Stuart Mill and John MaynardKeynes, or contemporaries like political scientist Ronald Inglehart, all of whomhave envisaged a similar shift, Fogel believes that \"we are reaching saturation incommodities that once defined a high standard of living and quality of life\" (p.190). Unlike these other critics, however, Fogel does not see the shift from mate-rialism as a natural consequence of goods saturation. Rather, the genesis of theshift is, in his view, the latest in a succession of religious-political cycles in Ameri-can history, a \"Fourth Great Awakening,\" set off since 1960 by a \"[r]eturn to sen-suous religion and reassertion of experiential content of [the] Bible\" (p. 28), andepitomized by the Religious Right. This religious movement's political effects, whichFogel dates roughly from 1990 onward, include an \"[a]ttack on materialist cor-ruption; rise of prolife, profamily, and media reform movements; expansion of tax revolt; [and] attack onentitlements\" (p. 28). He sees this new religious-political cycle as leading to a newtype of egalitarianism, a more equal distribution of what he calls \"spiritual resources.\" These spiritual resources, or spiritual assets, which are vital to both economic success and the good life, are, according to Fogel, 15 in number. Here is a sampleof five: sense of purpose, strong family ethic, work ethic, capacity to resist the lureof hedonism, and self-esteem (pp. 205-207). No data are given on any of the spiri-tual assets, but Fogel identifies two groups as especially disadvantaged in regard tosuch resources, namely, children of single teenage mothers and the elderly (pp.207-214). Other sections of the population that are noted as disadvantaged in-clude \"blacks, Hispanics, the poor generally, and women\" (p. 223). Those advan-taged are not specified, but those among the rich who are \"preoccupied with sen-sual gratification are as likely to fail in self-realization as are the poor who sharethat preoccupation\" (p. 205). One suspects that the advantaged are those who arebetter educated, because Fogel places education at the heart of his policy agendato achieve a more equitable distribution of spiritual resources. But the content ofthe education he advocates is far more sweeping than the expansion of traditionalcareer-oriented higher education. It embraces, among other things, \"prenatal coun-seling; mentoring programs for deprived mothers, alienated youngsters, and theaged; . . . and the development of lifelong educational programs\" (p. 217).830 PDR 26(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsThis summary of Fogel's thesis does not do justice to the wealth of historical knowledge in the book. Fogel traces a succession of four overlapping religious-political cycles since 1730 that have, in his view, shaped the struggle for egalitari-anism in America. These cycles are attributed to massive technological changesthat outrun \"human capacity to cope with change\" (p. 40). A sizable segment ofthe book is devoted to documenting and elaborating on \"technophysio evolution,\"including biomedical advances, and the manner in which the dislocations associ-ated therewith have caused powerful religious and political protest movements.The nature and causes of the historical development of the \"egalitarian creed inAmerica\" are also discussed at length. The volume is buttressed by seven appen-dixes and about 40 pages of footnotes. Demographers will be especially interested in Fogel's presentation of a figure for the United States for 1710 through 1970 based on approximately quinquen-nial data of the mean final height of native-born white American males and theirlife expectancy at age ten (p. 141). Fogel puzzles over the apparent contradictionin the nineteenth century between the lack of improvement in these series andthe large increase in per capita income. On the basis of the height and life expect-ancy series he argues that the \"modernization of the nineteenth century was amixed blessing for those who lived through it\" (p. 142), and that the twentiethcentury was, in fact, the century of more rapid progress. It is true that the standard of living, broadly conceived, advanced more rapidly in the twentieth century than in the nineteenth. But the nineteenth-century puzzlethat bemuses Fogel is a construct largely of an incomplete model, in which healthand life expectancy are expected to vary simply with nutritional intake (proxiedby GDP per capita), rather than with the retention of nutrients (which is affectedby the incidence of disease) as well. The time-series change in stature and lifeexpectancy is, in fact, dominated by the prevalence of diseases that determine nu-tritional retention, and it is not until the advance of knowledge brings contagiousdiseases under control that a \"take-off\" occurs in stature and life expectancy. Fogel'sanalysis would benefit by distinguishing explicitly between the goods and servicescomponent of the standard of living (captured in GDP estimates) and the healthcomponent (reflected in Fogel's measures of stature and life expectancy). If thiswere done, then rapid advance in the goods and services component would befound to date from the early part of the nineteenth century, while rapid advancein the health component dates from the bacteriological revolution of the late nine-teenth century (Easterlin 2000). By focusing primarily on stature and life expect-ancy, Fogel is led to a view of the trend in the general standard of living in whichthe nineteenth century is unduly biased downward. Reactions to this volume, considered as a whole, are likely to vary widely. Some may wonder why no mention is made of secular antimaterialist reformgroups, such as the environmental movement. Quantitative social scientists willfind the narrow line tread by Fogel between moralizing and analyzing a far cryfrom the tenets of the new economic history, for his contributions to which Fogelwas awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in economics. The emphasis of the new eco-nomic history is on the rigorous application of economic theory and quantitativeanalysis to the interpretation of history. Fogel is noted especially for his innova-tive work in \"counterfactual history,\" but not much of this to be found in theBOOK REVIEWS PDR 26(4 )831 Click to return to Table of Contentsbook. Europeans may especially wonder whether one can speak in such a pre- dominantly American vein of the post-1800 evolution of egalitarianism. But, thenotion of a \"Fourth Great Awakening\" of the sort described by Fogel will no doubthave considerable appeal to those who would like to believe that the pursuit ofmaterial goals is on the wane. Personally, I think the bulk of the evidence is to thecontrary, and that modern economic growth engenders a self-perpetuating pur-suit of material gain that militates against the shift Fogel envisages.

This volume is a translation popolazione nella storia d'Europa , origi- nally written in Italian for the series The Making of Europe , a joint venture of five European publishers to make the volumes available in English, German, Italian,French, and Spanish. Although the work is subtitled A History , it is not a conventional history of population. Livi Bacci does not try to reconstruct and describe systematically de-velopments from century to century during the second millennium. His purposeis to investigate why events unfolded and the reason for the differences betweenregions. In other words, this is not a descriptive but a pragmatic history: a histori-cal review of the entangled relationships between environment, economy, culture,and population systems and trends. Thus it lays claim to readers with a more gen-eral interest rather than those concerned with European historical demography. The starting point of the study is the size of the European population, which, through alternating periods of growth, stagnation, and decline during the past mil-lennium, increased by a factor of 10 or 20. In Livi Bacci's view these demographictransformations were the result of a clash between the factors of constraints (cli-mate, space, land, settlement patterns, disease, energy, and food) and the factorsof choice (socially and culturally determined and tied to individual, family, andcollective demographic behaviors). In the first four chapters, the author surveys the historical evidence on the primary constraints in the high-mortality and low-growth old demographic re-gimes and describes how they worked. The chapter on space deals not only withland reclamation and the slow conquest of space, but also with migration, settle-ment, and urbanization. The following two chapters examine the prominent rolesof morbidity and mortality in old-regime societies, where life expectancy at birth832 PDR 26(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentswas typically between 25 and 35 years, reaching 40 only for short periods before the nineteenth century. Although hunger and famine had dire demographic con-sequences, the author concludes that the prevailing theories about relationshipsbetween food supply, nutritional level, morbidity, and mortality are not supportedby historical facts. The link between food and mortality appears minimal or evennonexistent in cases of historically important diseases such as plague, smallpox,and malaria. In accordance with its prominent role in historical context, mortality is treated in several chapters. In the chapter on microbes and disease, a plethora of epidem-ics and their consequences are described in detail, especially the plague that firstappeared in 1347 and caused such losses that by the mid-fifteenth century therewere at least one-third fewer Europeans than a century before. The analysis ex-tends to the variability of the relationship between microbes and humans and totheir mutual adaptation. One purpose of historical studies is to obtain lessons in-structive for today, and the history of infectious diseases, indeed, offers such les-sons. Epidemics such as the plague and the deadly \"sweating sickness\" in the firsthalf of the sixteenth century appeared and disappeared without a satisfactory ex-planation. At the dawn of the twentieth century a false security developed, withthe assumption that modern clinical research, medical practice, and vaccinationcould eliminate communicable diseases. Then came the influenza epidemic of 1918;old pathologies like tuberculosis, cholera, and malaria reappeared; and new patho-gens and sicknesses are still appearing such as HIV/AIDS, Lyme disease, ebola, andrecently the West Nile virus in the New York metropolitan area. The lesson is: donot hope that the fight against epidemics is ever over. By way of introduction to the great transformation that began in the nine- teenth century, Livi Bacci describes the old-regime demographic system, a \"com-bination of demographic behaviors governed by fairly stable rules and relation-ships\" by use of the measure of reproductivity, which includes survival to adulthood,migration, nuptiality, duration of marriage, and fertility (pp. 92ff). With an abun-dance of relevant data, he discusses the great transformation of these factors: theunprecedented growth in the length of life expectancy, the explosive increase inpopulation that made mass overseas migration possible, the abandonment of \"natu-ral fertility,\" the advent of birth control, the secular decline of fertility unstop-pable by population policy measures, and the changes in nuptiality and other de-mographic behaviors. The author considers this process of transformation not as a simple dependent relationship between demography and economics but as an interactive relation-ship. He also reviews cultural changes, medical and nutritional advances, and otherfactors connected with the transition and, finally, provides a succinct descriptionof the demographic situation at the end of the transition cycle. The maze of historical facts provides evidence both for and against the demo- graphic transition model, but ultimately the debate has failed to produce an expli-cative model that incorporates the many relevant factors. This is partly becausesuch a model should explain not only the decline of fertility but the whole processof transition including other demographic variables. The author may have writtenthe last word on this debate (p. 157): \"The process of fertility decline, for the mostBOOK REVIEWS PDR 26(4 )833 Click to return to Table of Contentspart, followed the geographical path of economic development and declining mor- tality, but with many deviations and exceptions attributable to culture and tradi-tion, religions and institutions, permanence and change, all of which can only beunderstood at local and specific levels of analysis.\" Acs\u00e1di Associates, Consultants in Demography GEORGE T.

N AM Living and Dying in the USA: Behavioral, Health, and Social Differentials of Adult Mortality New York: Academic Press, 2000. xx + 354 p. $69.95. Inequalities of health\u2014and commentary about them\u2014have a long history in de- mographic research. Until comparatively recently most studies of adult mortalityhad been carried out in what are now low-mortality countries. In other parts ofthe world the focus has been on differentials in infant and child mortality. Thisconcentration has been dictated by data availability rather than by choice. Manystudies have found significant links between such aspects of mortality as sex, age,and cause of death, on one hand, and environmental, social, and economic fac-tors, on the other. Analyses of these links are typically hampered by the inconsis-tency of information coming from two different sources of data: usually censusand death registration. The book under review avoids this problem. The authorsuse a unique data set created in the United States by matching the annual Na-tional Health Interview Survey (NHIS) with the Multiple Cause of Death files (MCD). The linked data set thus alleviates the problem of inconsistency between numera- tor and denominator encountered when two diverse data sources are used in mor-tality analysis. The NHIS includes annual information on the civilian noninstitutionalized population in roughly 49,000 households; it covers gender, age, ethnicity, maritalstatus, family size, income, education, and current occupation. Supplementary ques-tions, which vary from year to year, include such items as religious attendance,sources of income, and health-related behavior. The NHIS data from the surveysof 1986 to 1994 were successfully matched with the MCD surveys for 1986 to1995 for individuals aged 18 years and older; as a result the characteristics of theindividuals interviewed in 1986-94 who later died have been identified. Thematched NHIS-MCD data set makes it possible to employ multivariate analysis, inparticular discrete hazard modeling, in the study of differentials in adult mortality. The contents of the book are well structured, making it comparatively easy to follow the exposition of the authors' analyses. Following the introduction and achapter on data and methods, the results of the analysis are presented in threemain parts: demographic and sociocultural characteristics associated with mortal-ity; socioeconomic factors and occupational status; health-related behavior andhealth status. In the concluding chapter the authors bring together the results of834 PDR 26(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentstheir analyses in an attempt to provide orientation to further research and policy formulation. Within each chapter the authors start by presenting a descriptive tablethat shows, for most covariates, the percentage distribution of cases specific to sur-vival status; for continuously measured variables, the mean values specific to sur-vival status are shown. Most of the analyses in the book are built around discrete-time hazard models using different sets of covariates as explanatory variables. Many of the findings shed new light on mortality differentials in the adult population. Thus, the authors found that some US minority groups\u2014MexicanAmericans, Cubans, and other Hispanics\u2014appear to have lower odds of mortalitythan their social and economic circumstances would lead one to expect. Selectiv-ity of the migration process probably plays some role in this. Among the causes ofdeath, social pathologies (accidents, homicides, suicides, cirrhosis of the liver) rep-resent a comparatively high risk among Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, otherHispanics, and African Americans, but a low risk among Asian Americans. Thedifferences may be closely related to health behavior, in particular smoking anddietary practices. In recent years, sex-specific differences in cigarette smoking ap-pear to have narrowed the sex gap in longevity as young women in the UnitedStates are now taking up smoking in greater proportions than men, and older menare quitting. It is also of interest that the sex mortality gap varies across social andeconomic strata of the society. Men living in high-income families have only mod-erately higher mortality than their female counterparts. The NHIS data provide new opportunities to consider the complex interplay between such characteristics as family composition and religious attendance andmortality. Family composition was found in this study to be significantly associ-ated with mortality risk of individuals. The lowest level of mortality is experiencedby individuals who live with their spouses and two children. Other family con-figurations have higher, sometimes considerably higher mortality. One of the high-est risks is that of an adult child living with married parents and two siblings. Malessuffer much higher mortality than females in comparable family arrangements.And in some instances the magnitude of the association between religious atten-dance and mortality is as strong as that between sex or ethnicity and mortality. Asthe authors point out, religious attendance is related to health-promoting behav-ior, to emotional, social, and even financial support, to reduction of stress, and toimproved recovery from illness and surgery. Education has been demonstrated to be strongly inversely associated with mor- tality (in particular, parents' education is inversely associated with mortality oftheir children). This study confirms that even in a low-mortality country, the levelof education has a detectable effect on adult mortality; however, its effect is nulli-fied by controlling for income and employment status. The study also confirmswhat has been labeled \"the healthy worker effect\": those who work, even in me-nial jobs, have generally lower mortality than those not in the labor force. Self-reported assessment of health status and health-related behavior is sel- dom found in demographic studies of mortality in general and adult mortality inparticular. The authors were able to incorporate such data as were provided in theNHIS as covariates in their models. Those self-identified as having mental disor-ders were found to have double the risk of death of those who were free of suchdisorders. Those reporting drug or alcohol abuse also had a higher risk of death.BOOK REVIEWS PDR 26(4 )835 Click to return to Table of ContentsOne of the leading causes of death in these groups is suicide. In contrast, the study suggests that light drinking is associated with lower risk of death; this confirmsearlier findings that attributed the effect to improved food digestion and increasein cholesterol-reducing lipids. Not unexpectedly, cigarette smoking was found tobe the most life-threatening among the behavior variables in this study. The authors, prominent demographers, have made a valuable contribution to the knowledge of factors associated with inequality of death in modern America.Their book\u2014which has an extensive list of references and good author and sub-ject indexes\u2014will be a valuable guide not only for further research on the subjectbut also for orientation of health policies. Fellow, Academy of the Social LADO T. R UZICKA Sciences, Australia SHORT REVIEWS by Susan Greenhalgh, Geoffrey McNicoll, Michael P. Todaro NEIL J. D IAMANT Revolutionizing the Family: Politics, Love, and Divorce in Urban and Rural China, 1949-1968 Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000. xviii + 440 p. $55.00. In this contentious book, political scientist and China specialist Neil J. Diamant challenges some long-held orthodoxies of the field, especially of its feminist wing.Based on the research of (mostly women) scholars in the early 1980s, the consen-sus of the field has been that the divorce provisions of the revolutionary 1950Marriage Law failed to produce fundamental change in marriage and gender rela-tions because peasant patriarchs opposed this destabilizing change and the party-state, needing the patriarchs' political support, backed away from implementingthe law. In this dissertation-turned-book Diamant, now at Tel Aviv University,reports the results of his research into the Chinese archives on divorce from fourlocales during the 1950s and 1960s. He argues that it was rural men\u2014not wom-en\u2014who were the big losers in the divorce battles of the early 1950s, and thatmen's victimization has been overlooked because research on these topics has been836 PDR 26(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentsdominated by women (p. 327), and because feminist scholars, despite their es- pousal of feminist views, have missed rural women's active agency in taking ad-vantage of the law to press for divorce. In developing this argument, the authorpresents colorful cases of \"feisty\" peasant women who actively defied the socialorder and state law. One woman reportedly told her husband's parents: \"Even ifthis food was shit, I still wouldn't give it to you\" (p. 9). Diamant clearly relisheshis role as iconoclast, but his challenge to the feminist work misses its mark fortwo reasons. First, Diamant lumps all \"Western feminists\" together, ignoring thelast decade of feminist recasting of gender issues in China; second, he exaggeratesthe impact of divorce on gender inequality by neglecting the question of the long-term effects of divorce on the two parties (something that would have requiredadditional interviews to understand). Diamant's use of his archival materials isalso questionable, for he treats the stories in the documents as unproblematic re-flections of social facts, ignoring their constructed character. Despite these over-sights and oversimplifications, Diamant's study makes some valuable contributions.It offers fascinating thoughts about such topics as the legal and sexual cultures ofthe Chinese peasantry, the scattered nature of the Chinese party-state, the contin-gent character of the state's penetration of family life, and the ironies of promot-ing \"modern\" change in a \"traditional\" society. For one versed in the literature onrural China, the author's reinterpretations make for lively and provocative read-ing. Although intended primarily for an audience of China specialists, Revolutioniz- ing the Family suggests fresh ways of understanding the politics of marriage and divorce that could usefully inform the work of students of the family in othersocieties as well.

Disasters in 1999, according to this latest edition of the IFRC disasters report, killed80,404 persons, a number exceeded only once (in 1991, with 201,459 fatalities,most of them caused by a cyclone in Bangladesh) in the last decade. In the largest1999 disaster, some 30,000 died in Venezuelan floods. \"Non-natural\" disasters,encompassing industrial, transport, and miscellaneous accidents, are reported tohave taken 6,361 lives\u2014presumably excluding road traffic fatalities, which in theUS alone have been running at 40-50,000 a year. These figures record local andsometimes national tragedies, but in global terms they seem modest numbers amidan annual total of 50 million deaths (though 212,544,647 persons are said to havebeen \"affected by disasters\" in 1999). The 2000 report expands its territory andcasualties by discussing what it calls \"chronic public health crises\" and \"ongoingdisasters.\" Separate chapters, their authors identified in the front matter, give vividand disturbing on-the-ground accounts of the African AIDS epidemic, the decayof North Korea's public health system, the continuing physical and psychologicaleffects of the Chernobyl explosion, the \"humanitarian Klondike\" of Kosovo. Thestatistical side of the report is a series of tables based on data compiled by theBOOK REVIEWS PDR 26(4 )837 Click to return to Table of ContentsCentre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) at the Catholic Uni- versity of Louvain, the US Committee for Refugees, the World Food Program, andthe OECD Development Assistance Committee. While the report recognizes thatdisaster data are \"essentially soft and noisy,\" a firmer hand governing their pre-sentation would be useful. Some of the noise, like the meaningless digits, could bereadily eliminated. But how is one to interpret a statement such as \"natural disas-ters have quadrupled since the 1960s\"?

CHRISTIAN JOPPKE Immigration and the Nation-State: The United States, Germany, and Great Britain New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. $72.00; $22.95 (pbk.). As corporate-led globalization inexorably reduces and eventually eliminates the power of individual nation-states to regulate and control the flow of goods, serv-ices, and finance across their borders, the last remaining barrier to a fully inte-grated world economy is to be found in the realm of restricted labor mobility.While the literature on international migration has become voluminous, few studieshave examined the impact of immigration on sovereignty and citizenship, two ge-neric attributes of the nation-state. In these two areas, at least, nation-states, ac-cording to the author of this interesting and informative book, have proved re-markably resilient. By comparing the postwar politics of immigration control andimmigrant integration in the United States, Germany, and Britain, Joppke dem-onstrates how the policies of these three liberal states, which are characterized byvery different traditions of nationhood, have led to distinct experiences concern-ing immigration. For example, the United States, which was founded, settled, anddeveloped by immigrants to such an extent that the idea of the melting pot be-came an abiding myth of the nation-state, stands in sharp contrast to Germany, anation of distinct ethnicity defined by common blood rather than a common creed.As a result, while the history of the former was one of inclusion and assimilation,that of the latter took on a character of exclusion through high barriers for admit-ting new citizens. Britain seems to share elements of both countries: a civic creedbut, until recently, a reluctance to open its borders to immigrants, even many ofthose from its former colonies. This book examines these three cases in two sections. Part I is a standard ex- amination of immigration policy\u2014the determination of regulations for entry andresidence, the nature of border controls, and the role of human rights perspec-tives. A separate chapter describes the approaches of each of the three countries.The United States is described as once again opening itself to large-scale immigra-tion in a context in which a civil rights culture of nondiscrimination and interestgroup politics both play a pivotal role. Germany is characterized as a nation that,in spite of \"zero-immigration\" policies since 1973, has nevertheless decided throughjudicial decisions and human rights considerations to permit continued residencefor previously recruited guestworkers. Britain is described as being more effective838 PDR 26(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of Contentsthan Germany in implementing its zero-immigration policies because of the weaker legal and moral restraints on the executive branch of its government. In Part II, the author focuses on \"multicultural integration\" with emphasis on citizenship as a legal status and identity. Again using a comparative analysis ofhow each of the three countries has dealt with the diverse national origins of re-cent immigrants, Joppke notes a growing commonality\u2014the erosion of the idea ofassimilation and the growing respect for the unique cultural identities of immi-grants. Each of the chapters in Part II is infused with the common theme of howimmigration challenges the nation-state in the area of sovereignty and citizenship.The author concludes, nevertheless, that in both of these dimensions the nation-state has maintained its resiliency. The strength of this book lies in its comparative analysis and its defense of the concept of nation-state sovereignty in the context of an increasingly borderlessworld. Its weakness, in addition to a neglect of the critical economic componentsof immigration, is its ponderous and jargon-filled prose that often requires thereader to endure convoluted discussions of straightforward ideas and concepts.Nevertheless, the uniqueness of perspective and a wealth of comparative insightsmake this book a valuable addition to the recent literature on international migra-tion.

The Changing Population of China Oxford: Blackwell, 2000. xvi + 291 p. $64.95; $29.95 (pbk.). The last two decades of modernizing reform in China have produced not only a new demographic landscape, but also a new, internationally oriented generationof demographers to map its dimensions and socioeconomic ramifications. This bookbrings the work of that younger, mostly foreign-trained generation of scholars,described by Peng Xizhe as \"the backbone of China's demographic community\"(p. 9), to an international audience. The book's 20 chapters are short (averaging14 pages), fact-filled, and descriptive. As employees of state-run organizations, Chi-nese demographers are expected to devote their energies to facilitating the smoothcoordination of population growth with socioeconomic development. Reflectingthis mandate, the topics covered here fairly closely track the concerns of China'spolicymakers. The chapters can be loosely grouped into three clusters. A first setdocuments the remarkable changes in fertility and mortality that have occurredsince the mid-twentieth century and the policy changes that propelled China'srapid transition to a low-fertility, low-mortality demographic regime. A secondgroup of chapters charts the impact of these demographic transformations onChina's society and economy. Deng's famous command, \"let some get rich first tolead all to common wealth,\" has been widely followed, spawning not only enrich-ment but also growing inequalities throughout society. The contributors to thisbook chart such trends as the increase in urban-rural inequality, the rising sexratio at birth, and the growing gaps in health care and old-age support, and de-BOOK REVIEWS PDR 26(4 )839 Click to return to Table of Contentsscribe the efforts the government has taken to lessen them. A third set of chapters covers a broad swath of social and economic domains that are linked in some wayto the changing size and structure of the population: education, employment, ur-banization, migration, population distribution, ethnicity, the environment, andmore. Although the chapters provide useful quantitative overviews of their topics,the data presented are often less than robust and current. Such data gaps reflectthe near-impossibility of gathering accurate population information in the highlypoliticized context of China, in which underreporting and manipulation of thenumbers are now rampant. Some discussion of these data difficulties by those whoknow most about them would have been helpful. Another opportunity missedhere was to reflect theoretically on the causes and consequences of the changeswrought in China's population. Nevertheless, the volume's short, table-filled chap-ters and broad coverage make this book the best English-language overview ofpopulation trends and problems in China available today. The editors' decision tolimit the presentation of technical details should make this collection highly ac-cessible to a wide readership. Until the results of the 2000 census are available,this will be the definitive text on the social and economic dimensions of China'spopulation. Chapter-end references, index.\u2014S.G.

Demography without numbers, went a 1980s-vintage commentary on the state ofthe field, is waffle, an amiable kind of social natural history. The writers had inmind words, but a fortiori they might have included pictorial essays. This book is ahefty challenge to such a stricture: wholly without numbers and with a minimumof text but at the same time an eloquent portrayal and, in a way, an analyticalscrutiny of its (demographic) subject. Salgado's photographs convey the hard-edgedrealities of mass population displacement and of people's search for political andeconomic security in the contemporary world. He captures refugee shambles amidsocial disorganization and environmental decline in tropical and arid-zone Africa,the physically fragile but socially resilient migrant settlements on the fringes ofAsian and Latin American megacities, the bravado of the act of border-crossing\u2014singly and en masse, South to North and East to West, and the unglamorous reali-ties that greet many migrants who finally reach the New World and, increasingly,the Old. As with any research endeavor, what is uncovered bears the marks of theresearch instrument. In this case, a visible record of the migration experience, byits nature, underrepresents success: migrants who have blended furthest into thenew society are no longer in transition. And photography as a medium is better indealing with economic hardship than with the myriad family-level strains of theefforts and inevitable failures in cultural maintenance. The collection complementsSalgado's equally impressive earlier book, Workers: An Archaeology of the Industrial Age (1993).\u2014G.McN.840 PDR 26(4) BOOK REVIEWS Click to return to Table of ContentsUNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME Human Development Report 2000 New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. xiv + 290 p. $38.95; $22.95 (pbk.). The series of Human Development Report s (HDR) begun in 1990 have been at the forefront of the UN's slide away from being an instrument of member states quastates to being a prodder of national and international social change. HDR 2000 , organized around the theme of human rights and human development, goes fur-thest in this direction, setting out the agenda of a global human rights regime (withthe goal of \"all rights for all people in every country\") and on particular issuessingling out individual countries for praise or scolding. The rights in question arethose delineated in the now numerous UN conventions, ranging from the Univer-sal Declaration of 1948 to the Worst Form of Child Labour Convention of 1999.(Eight pages are devoted to listing the signatory status of each member state for 14major conventions.) The Report is concerned to deny that economic rights shouldhave precedence over civil and political rights. The perspective of human develop-ment\u2014that is, \"the process of enlarging people's choices by expanding humanfunctionings and capabilities\"\u2014is seen as bringing these two sets of rights togetherin the cause of \"empowering people in the fight against poverty.\" Past successes instrengthening national and international institutional supports for human rightsare detailed and a strategy for the future is proposed. An imbalance that perhapsresults from this promotional enthusiasm is that the Report rarely mentions du-ties\u2014and when they are mentioned it is not as individual responsibilities comple-menting rights but as what governments must do to expand the exercise of rights.For example, problems of negative externalities of individual behavior, familiarissues in discussions of reproductive rights or in considering human impact on thenatural environment (and on nonhumans), are ignored. The HDR, the reader is told, is not a statistical publication but rather is a sec- ondary user of data from other agencies in the UN system and from a range ofnongovernmental organizations. The distinction may escape many readers: HDR 2000 includes over a hundred pages of tables reproducing these data, which most users will probably take at face value with UNDP imprimatur\u2014though in doing sothey would be overestimating the signal-to-noise ratio. (For a criticism of someHDR statistical procedures see the review of HDR 1998 by Ian Castles in PDR 24, no. 4.) HDR 2000 does, however, present detailed technical notes and source refer- ences on the data. The distinctive feature of the HDR's statistics is the construction of summary country-level indexes on aspects of human development. These nowinclude, in addition to the much-used and much-criticized human developmentindex ( HDI), two and HPI-2 ), the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure ( GEM ). An in- dex proposed in HDR 2000 but not actually calculated is a \"human rights interna- tional accountability index,\" indicators for which would include a country's timelysubmission of treaty reports, its ratification of individual complaints proceduresunder particular treaties, and its \"adequate response to recommendations by treatybodies.\" Authorship of HDR 2000 is ascribed to a team of UNDP staff and consultants, led by Richard Jolly, which \"assume[s] full responsibility for the opinions expressedin the Report.\"\u2014G.McN.BOOK REVIEWS PDR 26(4 )841 Click to return to Table of ContentsUNITED NATIONS POPULATION DIVISION The World at Six Billion New York, 1999. vii + 63 p. This brief, reader-friendly publication summarizes information from current UN population estimates, the 1998 UN projections series, and the (separately pub-lished) long-range projections (to 2150). A table, sourced from the Population Di-vision, gives world populations for the years 0 (300 million), 1000 (310 million),1250 (400 million), 1500 (500 million), and at 50- or 10-year intervals from 1750to 2150. (The peak, a population \"just above 10 billion,\" is located beyond thisdistant horizon, around 2200.) The population forecast for 2150 is 9.75 billion,appreciably below the 11.5 billion anticipated for that year in the 1990 assessment(see PDR 18, no. 2, pp. 333-340). The absolute annual increments to the world's population have been dropping since the late 1980s, down from 86 million to thepresent 78 million. But the forecast pace of accumulation remains impressive: thelast billion was added in 12 years, the next is expected to come in 14 years, andthe one after that in 15 years. Other items culled from the report: The average life expectancy of the world's population is 65 years and the average total fertility rate is 2.7 children per woman.Over the next 50 years 64 countries are forecast to more than double in popula-tion, 32 to show declines.

WORLD BANK Can Africa Claim the 21st Century? Washington, DC: World Bank, 2000. xiv + 278 p. $30.00. Africa here means sub-Saharan Africa. The title question refers to the prospectsfor the region catching up in development: Can Africa \"reverse years of social andeconomic marginalization in an increasingly dynamic and competitive world, andso be well placed, after the early decades of the century, to take advantage of therest?\" According to this report, a collaborative effort by the World Bank, the Afri-can Development Bank, the UN Economic Commission for Africa, the Global Coa-lition for Africa, and the African Economic Research Consortium, the answer isyes. There is currently a window of development opportunity created by threesets of conditions: the expansion in political participation and (it is hoped) in gov-ernment accountability; the cessation of malign Cold War-based influences on for-eign assistance and development policy; and the promise of information technol-ogy and globalization. The agenda for success is set out in a few brisk chapters: improving governance, addressing poverty, investing in people, lowering infrastruc-ture barriers, spurring agriculture, diversifying exports, and reducing aid dependency. At first sight the report is a kind of WDR-Lite, an impression given by its wide margins to accommodate one-sentence summaries of the text and its many edify-ing miniature case-studies in boxes. But though brief, it is not anodyne. It is nu-anced and blunt on government performance (Mauritius\u2014African by propinquity\u2014is the principal exhibit of \"capable and effective governance\"; larger numbers ofcountries are grouped under \"state crisis and institutional decay\" and \"violent con-flict and state disintegration\"). It pushes privatization, removal of trade barriers (itspeaks of \"noxious cereal export bans\"), and participation in WTO rule-making. Itgives due policy attention to health (the AIDS catastrophe in particular) and topoverty and income inequality. Given the scope and auspices of the document, a somewhat notable feature of it is the triviality of its treatment of population concerns\u2014and the total absence ofpopulation policy, even family planning, in the agenda it puts forward. The popu-lation of sub-Saharan Africa, by current UN projections, is set to rise from 640million to 1.5 billion in the next 50 years, with fertility dropping to replacementlevel by that time. With a slightly slower rate of fertility decline (the high-variantscenario), there are an additional 300 million people in 2050. But the report merelyremarks that Africa's demographic transition is lagging behind the rest of the world,giving it an unfavorable age distribution for saving. Then it moves on to \"investingin people\" through better education and health. It would be hard to find a betterinstance of the penetration into agency thinking of the \"Cairo consensus,\" withfertility decline seen as a socially and economically incidental byproduct of thoseinvestments.\u2014G.McN.POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 26(4) (DECEMBER 2000) 843DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of ContentsGlobalization and Inequality: A Norwegian Report Is global inequality increasing? Some authoritative voices\u2014for example, from the United Na- tions Development Programme\u2014assert unequivocally that it is, and have carried popular beliefwith them. Others see a more nuanced and on balance a positive picture. Any attempt to answerthe question must grapple with many conceptual and measurement difficulties. These are notwholly eliminated even if the inequality in question is narrowed to that among the per capitaincomes of countries, ignoring intra-country differences in income. Disagreement about the empirical record has not impeded argument over causes. Glo- balization\u2014the expansion of trade, investment, and technology flows among states that ismaking for a more integrated world economy\u2014is invoked on both sides: seen by some asfurther marginalizing the world's poor, by others as offering a route out of poverty. Thestarkly different positions surface in the heated debates that have surrounded the WorldTrade Organization and the proposal for a Multilateral Agreement on Investment. The nature of trends in international inequality and the role in them of globalization are explored in a recent report issued by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Globalisation and Inequality: World Income Distribution and Living Standards, 1960- 1998 (October 2000), the summary from which is reproduced below. The report finds that global inequality between countries has decreased over the last four decades. Globalizationmay or may not have contributed to that outcome, but at least does not appear to workagainst it. In sum, \"not everything has turned out badly; in fact there has\u2014in spite of thesetbacks in some regions and in spite of population growth\u2014been considerable global progressduring the last decades.\" Given the chosen focus on inequality, there is little discussion in the report of that other dimension of global progress: changes in absolute income levels. But in assessing theimplications of development for human welfare, the issue of economic growth and its rela-tionship to globalization is clearly pertinent. Footnote 4 offers a passing glimpse of that di-mension, referring to changes in absolute poverty. The World Bank's World Development Report 2000/2001 estimates that the number of people in absolute poverty (living on less than $1 a day) changed little between 1987 and 1998: it went from 1.18 billion to 1.20billion. As the population grew, this meant a modest reduction in the proportion in absolutepoverty in the world population (excluding the rich countries): from 28.3 percent to 24.0percent. But in the East Asia and Pacific region\u2014a region characterized by both rapid over-all economic growth and increasing integration into the global economy\u2014the number ofpoor dropped from 418 million to 278 million during the same period, with the proportiondropping from 26.6 percent to 15.3 percent. The report was commissioned from the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI), and prepared by Arne Melchior, Kjetil Telle, and Henrik Wiig.

Has globalisation led to more inequality in the world economy? Does international trade and investment make the industrial countries richer, and the developing countries poorer? Such statements are frequently heard in the public debate on globalisation and international trade policy. In the debate about the World Trade Organisation (WTO), some critics main- tain that free trade causes inequality to rise.1 When the OECD tried to negotiate the Multi-lateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), some sceptics argued that international investment had a negative impact on developing countries. Attitudes concerning globalisation and inequal- ity thus play an important role in debates on international policy. In order to find out whether globalisation has led to more inequality, we should first find out whether inequality has increased or not. Next, we must analyse the causal links between globalisation and inequality. The extent of in-equality is obviously influenced by other forces than globalisation. This report answers the first question; i.e. on whether global inequality has increased or not, and sketches out possible links between globalisation and inequality. The main purpose of the report is to present a thorough examination of how inequality has developed over a long time period (1960-1998), compar- ing different measures and methods. The re- port summarises the main findings in Melchior et al. (2000), which contains (in Norwegian) a more detailed examination of the issues. An important source for those who main- tain that inequality has increased during the last decades is the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): In their Human Develop- ment Report (UNDP 1999, 3) they state that income inequality between rich and poor coun- tries has widened continuously towards the end of the 20th century. In our report, we argue that the UNDP applies an inappropriate mea- sure. With a more reasonable method, the con- clusion is that inequality between countries inthe world has been reduced since the mid-1960s. And even with the measure used by the UNDP, inequality across countries has decreased dur- ing parts of the 1990s . There is widespread agreement\u2014including the UNDP\u2014that if the purpose is to compare living standards in different countries, one should apply income figures that are adjusted for differences in purchasing power. In recent years, substantial effort has been made in or- der to provide such data. The data set used in the report includes such figures for 115 coun- tries for the period 1965-98. The analysis based on these data reveals that, with some minor variations, international income inequality has de- creased continuously from the last part of the 1960s until 199 7. This conclusion applies if we com- pare incomes in the countries comprising the richest and poorest quintile of the world popu- lation, and it applies when we use statistical measures of inequality, e.g. the Gini coeffi-cient. 2 What, then, is the basis for UNDP's state- ments on increased international inequality? In UNDP (1999), only a few scattered (and sparsely documented) figures are provided, based on income figures that are not adjusted for purchasing power differences. These figures show the ratio between the income of the quintile of the world population living in the richest countries, and the income of the quintile living in the poorest countries. According to UNDP (1999, 3 and 36), this ratio increased from 30:1 in 1960 to 60:1 in 1990 and 72:1 in 1997. In the Human Development Report 1998 (UNDP 1998), the ratio for 1995 was said to be 82:1. According to this, inequality decreased 1Some examples are mentioned in Dollar and Kraay (2000).DOCUMENTS 845 Click to return to Table of Contentsduring 1995-97. This was, however, not men- tioned in UNDP (1999)\u2014where globalisation and inequality was a main theme. As our own analysis based on similar figures for 1980-98 reveals, inequality increased during 1985-93 but fell during the period 1993-98. As noted above, such results are less relevant since\u2014for the purpose of analysing international inequal- ity\u2014one should use data that are adjusted for purchasing power differences. UNDP has defended its method by refer- ring to quality problems related to purchasing power-adjusted data, and with some less clear arguments telling that the dollar value of a county's income is more relevant for studying the marginalisation of poor countries in world trade and their power in international nego- tiations.3 There are certainly problems with purchasing power-adjusted income data, and they exist for fewer countries than those that are not adjusted for price differences. In spite of this, there is widespread agreement that ad- justed figures should be used when comparing international income differences. Such figures are also used by the UNDP when they construct their Human Development Index (HDI). Our results are in line with some other re- search contributions (that have analysed the development until ca. 1990). Research in the area suggests that international inequality in- creased until the 1960s, but this long-term trend was broken towards the end of the cen- tury. An important reason for this change has been growth in parts of Asia, and especially in China. If China is removed from our sample, the degree of international inequality has hardly changed over the period studied. China is a populous country, and it therefore has a considerable impact on the world average, as is reasonable. International measures of inequality will necessarily hide important differences between the regions of the world economy. While the newly industrialised countries in East andSouth East Asia have experienced enormous economic growth and partly caught up with the richer countries, Sub-Saharan Africa has stagnated\u2014especially after 1980. The collapse in Eastern Europe after 1980 has also been an economic tragedy in some countries. In spite of reduced international inequality, the gap be- tween rich and poor countries is still enor- mous.4 Our purpose is not to underestimate this gap, but to examine its development in an unbiased way, as a point of departure for dis- cussing how the gap may be reduced. In this context, it is encouraging that the trend to- wards more inequality until the 1960s has been reversed towards the end of the century. Our conclusion on international inequal- ity is based on a comparison across countries, and thus neglects inequality within countries. If we take inequality inside countries into ac- count, and calculate an index of global inequal- ity between person s, the results might be differ- ent. Some unpublished results of this type suggest that global inequality increased from 1988 until 1993. Such studies face consider- able challenges in terms of data and method- ology, and more research covering a longer time period is needed in order to obtain a reli- able assessment of trends over time. Other re- sults suggest that 80-90 per cent of global in- equality is captured by income differences across countries. For this reason, comparisons across countries make sense when measuring international inequality. Nevertheless, a possible objection to our analysis is that it gives a rosy picture since in- tra-country inequality is neglected. Research on inequality in countries reveals that rich coun- tries have less inequalit y. For changes over time, however, the examination in this report shows that the relationship between economic growth and inequality within countries is complex. From the 1970s until the 1990s, inequality in- creased in approximately half the 80 countries covered by the data, and decreased in the other half. There were fluctuations over time, with more inequality towards the end of the period. 3See UNDP (2000), Response to Mr. Castles' Room Document on Human Development Report 1999, accessible on www.undp.org. Here (page 5), wages and hotel prices in Geneva are even referredto as arguments for using income data that are notadjusted for purchasing power differences. This wouldcertainly be relevant for an analysis of negotiation ca-pacity in the WTO, but hardly for international com- parisons of welfare.4Problems of poverty are thus still huge. We do not present new results on this, but refer to available evidence. Results from the World Bank suggest thatthe number of poor people (living on less than onepurchasing power-adjusted dollar per day), was at thesame level in 1998 as in 1987, but with some reduc-tion after 1993.846 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of Contentsbe caused by global progress in medical tech- nology and knowledge about diseases. In the former Soviet Union and in Sub-Saharan Af- rica, some countries have experienced a reduc- tion in life expectancy after 1987, due to eco- nomic decline, conflicts or AIDS. On the whole, however, the trend during 1962-97 has been towards more global equality with respect to life ex- pectanc y. For education, substantial progress in school participation occurred between 1960 and 1995. While developing countries still lag consider- ably behind rich countries for higher education, the relative difference in combined school par- ticipation (primary, secondary and tertiary edu- cation) has been narrowed during the period. An exception to this trend is Sub-Saharan Af- rica after 1980, where combined school par- ticipation did not increase. Our analysis of edu- cation does not take into account quality differences in schooling, which are also impor- tant if we want to obtain a more precise pic- ture of the education gap between rich and poor countries. Life expectancy and school participation increase with the income of each country. To- gether with income and literacy, these variables enter into the calculation of the so-called Hu- man Development Index (HDI), reported an- nually by the UNDP. Calculations of such in- dexes over time (undertaken by the UNDP and other researchers) indicate that poor countries are catching up with the rich ones. In fact, the HDI provides a picture of trends in international in- equality that is even more positive than the one we have obtained based on income data alone . This, to- gether with our analysis of education and life expectancy, supports our conclusion concern- ing reduced global inequality during the last decades. It also indicates that the picture de- rived from purchasing power-adjusted income data is not \"too positive\". The analysis of income and living standards thus points in the same direction. Since income, life expectancy and education are also corre- lated, it is also the case that the HDI index it- self is strongly correlated with income. For 1997, variations in income statistically explain 84% of the variation in the HDI. We therefore conclude that the HDI makes us a little\u2014but not too much\u2014wiser. In order to draw atten- tion to the analysis of living standards, how- ever, the HDI has been a success.Except for Eastern Europe, where inequality has generally increased, there is considerable variation between countries within the same regions. Such variation is also present among rich as well as poor countries. Some results sug- gest that economic decline is more likely to cause increased inequality. It is in accordance with this hypothesis that inequality has in- creased in Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa after 1980. Research in the field also sug- gests that there is no simple link between eco- nomic growth and inequality; high-growth countries experience less inequality in some cases and more in other cases. This lack of a clear link between growth and inequality also reduces the risk that comparisons across coun- tries may give a biased picture of global inequal- ity. A recent World Bank study (Dollar and Kraay 2000) suggests that economic growth benefits the rich and the poor in each country to the same extent. Since measures of international inequality are strongly influenced by the development in China, it is of special interest whether growth in China has benefited the poor Chinese or not. Studies of this (World Bank 1997) reveal that economic growth in China has been particu- larly strong in urban areas and in the coastal regions, and this has contributed to more in- equality within China after 1978. In spite of this, inequality in China is still below the high levels of Latin America and Sub-Saharan Af- rica. Income growth in China has also benefited the poor; particularly during 1980-84 and 1990-95, there was substantial income growth also among poor Chines e. Due to this, the number of poor people in China in 1995 was 250 millions below what it would have been without in- come growth for the poor. Another possible objection to our conclu- sion on international inequality is that income is a too limited measure of living standards, and that other indicators of welfare should be taken into account. For this reason, the report exam- ines the development of other aspects of living standards, with focus particularly on life expect- ancy and education. Average world life expect- ancy increased from 55 years in 1962 to 67 years in 1997. The improvement was consid- erable for a number of poor countries. Part of the improvement can be attributed to economic growth, but a substantial part of the increase was unrelated to income changes, and couldDOCUMENTS 847 Click to return to Table of ContentsThe empirical analysis of the report thus indicates that during the last decades of the 20th century, international inequality has been reduced, while inequality within countries fol- lows a mixed pattern. The next question is then: How can these changes be explained by \"globalisation\"? The analysis falsifies simplified allegations about globalisation and inequality. On the other hand, the analysis does not al- low us to conclude that \"globalisation reduces inequality\". Such a statement would also be far too simple. Globalisation is a complex process where some mechanisms may contribute to greater equality, while others may promote more inequality. Furthermore, globalisation oc- curs simultaneously with other important phe- nomena that may affect the extent of inequal- ity, e.g. technological and political changes. In order to derive causal links, such other influ- ences have to be taken into account. An analy- sis of the causal links between globalisation and inequality is thus a large-scale project beyond the limits of this report. We sketch out possible links between globalisation and inequality as a framework for the interpretation of empirical facts, and as an indication of important issues for further research. The survey is based on theory as well as empirical research. In some cases, the theories are supported by empirical research; in many cases, however, research is still not able to give precise answers. Globalisation is a process with faster changes in the global division of labour. \"Low- cost imports\"\u2014especially from East and South East Asia\u2014have already replaced some of the OECD countries' own production of e.g. cloth- ing and electronics. The integration of poor and populous countries like China into the world economy pushes the process further: When China takes over larger shares of the world market for e.g. clothing, other Asian countries have to move into other industries, and the challenges are increased for other developing countries that want to enter this market. In- creased trade is a two-way process; when China sells clothing to rich countries, the rich coun- tries may sell more machinery to China. In- creased trade thus leads to restructuring within each country: While textile workers in the OECD lose their jobs, thousands of new textile workers are hired in China. While the machin- ery industry in the OECD grows, inefficient plants in China are closed. Trade may be to theadvantage of both rich and poor countries, but some groups inside each country may lose. Ac- cording to the theory, trade may reduce the income gap between rich and poor countries, while leading to more inequality within rich countries and less in poor countries. If the textile workers in the West get new jobs or they are educated to other professions, restructuring may take place without losers. In the West, however, it has been observed that the gap (in terms of income or unemployment) between skilled and unskilled workers has in- creased during the last two decades. Is globalisation the cause of this? Research in the field suggests that globalisation is partly to blame, but that an even more important rea- son for the gap is technological change that in- creases the demand for skilled labour in most industries. A substantial amount of research has been undertaken for the OECD, but surpris- ingly little on the impact on developing coun- tries. Furthermore, there is too little research that sheds light on how the entry of China (and gradually India) into the world economy may affect other developing countries. Research on the impact of globalisation on low-skilled workers in rich countries illustrates that globalisation occurs together with radical changes in technology that may reshape the world economy. Recent research on economic growth focuses particularly on innovation as a source of economic growth, and the spread of technology as an important determinant for the extent of inequality between countries. The development in electronics since 1960 illus- trates that while innovation has primarily taken place in rich countries, some poor countries have developed through copying technology, and gradually became major exporters. Globalisation increases the potential for the spread of technology through trade (especially imports of capital equipment) and international investment. The slicing up of the value added chain within multinational corporations allows poor countries to produce some of the goods with a limited technological base. Research in the area suggests that multinationals contrib- ute positively to the international diffusion of technology; but only under the precondition that the receiving country has a certain mini- mum standard in terms of education and tech- nology, or a certain \"absorptive capacity\" or \"social capacity\". An important issue is whether848 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of Contentsinformation and communication technology raises the threshold for poor countries. The spread of such technology so far reveals a con- siderable gap between rich and poor countries, but things change rapidly, and countries like India and Taiwan have already demonstrated that information technology is not reserved for the rich. The term \"social capacity\" in research on technology has relevance in other fields as well. If e.g. countries have too weak institutions to handle structural adjustment and social change, they may be losers in the global competition. Such \"institutional failure\" may be a part of the explanation of the weak development in Sub- Saharan Africa and parts of Eastern Europe af- ter 1980. Another possible explanation why some regions develop favourably while others stag- nate may be that both are part of a common process that creates winners and losers. Recent research on economic geography and growth tells us some such stories about globalisation creating agglomeration or \"industrial clusters\" in some places, and decline in other areas. Economies of scale of various kinds, or \"cumu- lative causation\" (good or bad circles), may lead to such asymmetries. So far, however, there is no empirical research that suggests e.g. that \"growth in Asia and stagnation in Africa are two sides of the same coin\". Research in the area has not confirmed that such a global link is present. A more plausible hypothesis is that agglomeration or regional integration in parts of the world economy may cause local \"dam- age\"; e.g. that regional integration may hurt surrounding countries that do not participate. More research is needed in order to confirm whether this is true\u2014or theoretical speculation only. For inequality within countries, the public sector is important. In the debate on globalisa- tion, some critics have warned that global com- petition may erode the tax base and lead to a \"race to the bottom\" that undermines public welfare policy. The literature in the field shows, however, that internationalisation in the West has been accompanied by a continuous expan-sion of the public sector, and that open econo- mies have a larger public sector than closed ones. Research also suggests that public income has been maintained, and that the state's room of manoeuvre for redistributive policies has not been substantially reduced. Public expenditure that is directly related to the production sys- tem (education, infrastructure etc.) is better for growth than pure redistribution. In spite of this, it is not necessarily true that competition leads to cuts in welfare expenditure: Some research- ers have argued that globalisation may create more demand for redistribution and lead to an expansion of public expenditures. Concerning state income, some reallocation has taken place from capital taxation to taxation of labour. In- creased international capital mobility is a pos- sible explanation of this. It would be pure guesswork if\u2014based on our result about reduced global inequality\u2014we concluded that \"globalisation leads to more equality\". In order to draw such conclusions, more specific analyses are needed. We hope to be able to undertake such research in the fu- ture. References Dollar, D. and Kraay, A.

The recent United Nations report on \"replacement migration\" (see the Documentssection in the June 2000 PDR) highlighted the issue through illustrative calculations show- ing the size of immigrant streams that would be needed for achieving specified demographictargets in selected low-fertility countries, given continuation of present fertility and mortalitytrends. For example, the UN report suggested that in Italy\u2014which has one of the lowestfertility rates in the world\u2014maintaining a constant population over time would require anet influx of some 12.6 million immigrants during the next 50 years, and maintaining aconstant labor force-age population (ages 15-64) would require a net inflow of 18.6 mil-lion. Yet immigration policy in Western Europe has become increasingly restrictive duringthe last quarter-century, and the official policy stance that regulating immigration is strictlywithin the domain of a country's sovereign right has been assiduously maintained. (Inter-national treaty obligations qualify that right in the case of bona fide asylum seekers; how-ever, the definition of that category is also subject to the discretion of the receiving countries.)Thus, although within the European Union national borders are open to EU citizens, thepower of regulating immigration from outside the EU is retained by the individual countriesrather than subject to EU-wide decisions. Suggestions coming from the developing countriesto follow up the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development with anintergovernmental conference on international migration and development were set aside bythe potential immigrant-receiving countries as overly contentious. A statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Lamberto Dini, delivered at the 55th General Assembly of the United Nations, 13 September 2000, may be a sign of anotable shift in official approaches to immigration policy by at least one EU member state.The statement, in a departure from the practice of touching lightly upon a wide range ofissues in international affairs, typical in high-level ministerial speeches given at that UNforum, is devoted essentially to a single topic: international migration. It characterizes mi-gration \"between or within continents\" as an international problem and advocates \"coordi-nated and integrated\" instruments in seeking a solution. It suggests that \"today, with a de-clining birth rate and an aging population, Europe needs a strategy that embraces the complexprocess of integrating people from different regions of the world.\" The rules for internationalmigration, the statement claims, should be set in a global framework, such as provided bythe United Nations. In the \"age of globalization,\" \"a solidarity pact is needed to find the bestand most effective way of balancing the supply and demand of labor.\" With the omission ofopening and closing ceremonial passages and a brief comment on the problem of debt relief,the statement is reproduced below.850 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of Contents2001 will be the United Nations Year for Dia- logue among Civilizations. By unanimously adopting the relevant Resolution in its 53rd Session, the General Assembly demonstrated its great sensitivity and attention to the pro- found structural changes underway in our national societies. It thereby sent a strong sig- nal on a number of themes that the Secre- tary-General has put forth in his report on the role of the Organization in the 21st cen- tury. These themes cannot fail to include the new face of international migration, whose gravest aspects include illegal immigration and the trampling of human dignity. Dialogue among civilizations should not be addressed in the abstract, academically. It demands real contact, a bond between indi- viduals and peoples. To ensure that these contacts, this bond, do not mutate into ten- sions and strife, the community of states must try to understand and manage migratory phenomena. We must work together to pre- vent migration flows from plunging into chaos, a chaos for which the human person ultimately has to pay the highest price. Migration needs to be governed by fixed transparent rules. The source, the rationale of these rules is the United Nations, to which the San Francisco Charter entrusts the fundamen- tal role, \"To achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an eco- nomic, social, cultural and humanitarian char- acter.\" I submit to you that today migration between or within continents has become an international problem with an economic, so- cial, cultural and humanitarian character. Any solution to the problems connected with migration must come to terms with the globalization process. Globalization has reduced distance and time. To an unprecedented degree it has linked countries at opposite ends of the Earth. There are even those who speak, per- haps not wrongly, of \"the end of geography.\" The paradox facing us stems from the real difficulties of globalization extending not only to the economy, finance and information but also to the movements of peoples. Most of these difficulties can be ascribed to the com- plex transition of many advanced countries to multi-ethnic and multicultural societies. Human beings are not commodities. When individuals move, they preserve their roots, their specificity and their experience,even when they come into permanent con- tact with societies different from their own. Hence the need for mutual tolerance, to safe- guard our respective customs and traditions. The growing dimensions of migration have widened the gap between individual government's management capabilities and the individual person's ability to move, which is heavily influenced by progress in commu- nications. All too often this gap is filled by organized crime, by ruthless criminals who in some cases traffic in human beings, in what amounts to a modern form of slavery. We need to ask how we can safeguard freedom while impeding slavery; how we can prevent global economic development from sparking social tensions; how we can ensure that the growing contact between different civilizations will produce dialogue rather than intolerance. It will take a strong, determined commitment from all of us to draft rules that, if applied, can have a positive impact on in- ternational migration flows, to the benefit of both home and host countries. Improving millions of human lives is the fundamental challenge of development: We need a clear, explicit and effective commit- ment to eradicate poverty. We must realize that in a globalized world, migration can gradually impoverish areas that are already economically and socially disadvantaged. . . . The fears that immigration sometimes generates should not lead industrialized countries to build new walls and fences. Such fears reject contact with diversity and make some feel as if they were strangers in their own country. A Europe built on fear, for ex- ample, would ultimately cast immigrants as the imaginary enemy, as a race apart. Any effort to overcome such negative stereotyp- ing should be applauded, such as the Confer- ence on Racism, scheduled for 2001 in Pretoria. The European Union has a great capac- ity to take in people, and already has large immigrant communities. But only now is it developing a common approach to immigra- tion. The EU's strategy relies on cooperation with other countries, since the issue cannot be addressed solely through border patrolsDOCUMENTS 851 Click to return to Table of Contentsand tougher repression of illegal immigration, regardless of the cost. For many years Europe did not have to worry about the long-term consequences of immigration. But today, with a declining birth rate and an aging population, Europe needs a strategy that embraces the complex process of integrating people from different regions of the world. Then there is the tragic, heinous traffick- ing in human beings. As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated before this Assem- bly yesterday, we must put a stop to this traf- ficking, a stop to boats being cast into the sea, filled with sadness and desperation, driven by hopes in a promised land. The pictures of these illegal crossings have become unbearable. They epitomize a state of affairs governed by the black market, where there is an overabundance of illegal labor. This new form of piracy would be impossible if those involved knew that they could not count on collusion, safe havens, and all too often, impunity. For example, the Mediterranean Sea, around which great civilizations have pros- pered, is being crossed by people who pay ruthless exploiters and sometimes become their victims. In many cases, illegal immi- grants find it hard to gain access to the rule- of-law society, and end up being treated as commodities. Immigration has various causes: poverty, ethnic and religious strife, the repression of totalitarian regimes, and the demands of more affluent economies. Today, as never before, immigration is driven by broadcast images that often distort honest hopes for a better life. Moreover, it has reached unprec- edented proportions. In fact, since the early Eighties the number of countries that receive immigrants has risen from 39 to 67, while the number of countries of emigration has risen from 29 to 55. We would be fooling our- selves to think that a phenomenon of such pro- portions could be brought under control solely through bilateral agreements. The European Union has made coopera- tion between national governments a prior- ity since the European Council of October 1999. But recent experience points to the need for an approach on which only the United Nations can confer the indispensable character of universality.Italy has much to share in this regard. Until a few decades ago, large sections of our population were forced to seek work in dis- tant lands with different languages and tra- ditions. Their lives were often marked by hardship, want and family separation. This chapter of social history had points of light and of darkness, but on the whole it was a source of great moral and spiritual wealth. Starting in the early Seventies Italy be- came a land of immigration, although it could not yet provide full employment for all of its people. As a land of both emigration and im- migration, Italy is well situated to address in a constructive manner global migration today. Italian domestic law is based on the principle of \"soft integration,\" designed to provide per- manent residents with an opportunity that does not force them to renounce the rich heritage of their native cultures. It is on these grounds that, here before the General Assembly, I urge the United Na- tions to raise the awareness of the commu- nity of states and introduce appropriate in- struments. Three instruments deserve to be coordinated and integrated. First: assistance to the developing coun- tries. Assistance in preventing and quelling the tensions that, at least in part, give rise to migration flows, as well as assistance in eas- ing the integration of their economies with those of the more advanced countries. As we all know, this is a priority that the United Nations is pursuing through various commit- tees and an enhanced role of UNDP. We must strive to improve the instruments already available to us, responding to the visionary proposals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Second: as a deterrent to illegal entry, stricter and more consistent law enforcement. Success depends on effective cooperation be- tween the countries of origin, the countries of transit, and the countries of arrival. Such efforts should also aim to prevent the spread of pockets of illegality and organized crime by promoting greater stability, moral author- ity and control in fledgling democracies. This would be invaluable to securing the support of public opinion in industrialized countries for cooperation policies. Third: management of migration so that it is a source of stability and wealth, to the benefit of all. For this to happen, migration852 DOCUMENTS Click to return to Table of Contentsmust take place legally. If everyone complies with the law, immigrants will be welcomed in their host countries and become fully in- tegrated into society. These three guidelines must be set within a global framework. There are plenty of or- ganizations that deal with migration at the international level. Yet while they provide praiseworthy services, their sectorial nature means that they cannot have the kind of overall vision that only effective coordination can guarantee.A solidarity pact is needed to find the best and most effective way of balancing the sup- ply and demand of labor, while fully respect- ing the diversity of the people concerned. The greatest challenge in the age of globalization is to design new forms of cooperation between governments that will enable each to see that their interests are reflected in international policy decisions. The United Nations continues to be the most natural forum for adopting such decisions and ensuring their implementation.POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 26(4) (DECEMBER 2000) 853ABSTRACTS Click to return to Table of ContentsPopulation and Resources: An Exploration of Reproductive andEnvironmental Externalities PARTHA DASGUPTA This article identifies four types of social ex- ternalities associated with fertility behavior. Three are shown to be pronatalist in their effects. These three are exemplified by theway theories of economic growth treat fer- tility and natural resources, the way popu- lation growth and economic stress in poorcountries are seen by environmental and re- source economists, and the way develop- ment economists accommodate environ-mental stress in their analysis of poverty. It is shown that the fourth type of externality, in which children are regarded as an end inthemselves, can even provide an invidious link between fertility decisions and the use of the local natural-resource base amongpoor rural households in poor countries. The fourth type is used to develop a theory of fertility transitions in the contemporaryworld; the theory views such transitions as disequilibrium phenomena. Unmet Need for Family Planning in Developing Countries andImplications for Population Policy JOHN B. C ASTERLINE STEVEN W. S INDING Unmet need for family planning has been a core concept in international population dis- course for several decades. This article re-views the history of unmet need and the de- velopment of increasingly refined methods of its empirical measurement and delineatesthe main questions that have been raised about unmet need during the past decade, some of which concern the validity of theconcept and others its role in policy debates. The discussion draws heavily on empirical research conducted during the 1990s, muchof it localized, in-depth studies combiningquantitative and qualitative methodologies. Of the causes of unmet need other thanthose related to access to services, three emerge as especially salient: lack of neces- sary knowledge about contraceptive meth-ods, social opposition to their use, and health concerns about possible side effects. The ar- ticle argues that the concept of unmet needfor family planning, by joining together con- traceptive behavior and fertility preferences, encourages an integration of family planningprograms and broader development ap- proaches to population policy. By focusing on the fulfillment of individual aspirations,unmet need remains a defensible rationale for the formulation of population policy and a sensible guide to the design of family plan-ning programs. Local and Foreign Models of Reproduction in Nyanza Province,Kenya SUSAN COTTS WATKINS This article uses colonial archival records, surveys conducted in the 1960s, and surveys and focus group discussions in the 1990s todescribe three distinct but temporally over- lapping cultural models of reproduction in a rural community in Kenya between the1930s and the present. The first model, \"large families are rich,\" was slowly undermined by developments brought about by the integra-tion of Kenya into the British empire. This provoked the collective formulation of a sec- ond local model, \"small families are progres-sive,\" which retained the same goal of wealth but viewed a smaller family as a better strat- egy for achieving it. The third model, intro-duced by the global networks of the inter- national population movement in the 1960s, augmented the second model with the de-liberate control of fertility using clinic-pro- vided methods of family planning. By the 1990s this global model had begun to be do-mesticated as local clinics routinely promoted family planning and as men and women in854 ABSTRACTS / F RENCH Click to return to Table of ContentsNyanza began to use family planning and to tell others of their motivations and experi- ences. Conditioning Factors for Fertility Decline in Bengal: History, Language Identity, and Openness to Innovations ALAKA MALWADE BASU SAJEDA AMIN This article argues that looking solely for the immediate causes of reproductive changemay distort our understanding of policy op- tions by failing to take into account the his- torical and cultural factors that affect notonly the impact of policies and programs but their very nature and existence. The article examines the historical origins and spread of\"modern\" ideas in Bangladesh and the state of West Bengal in India. It concludes that a colonial history in which education andmodernization processes took hold very early among the elites in the larger Bengal region was paradoxically accompanied by a strongallegiance to the Bengali language. This strong sense of language identity has facili- tated and reinforced the diffusion of mod-ern ideas both within and between the two Bengali-speaking regions. Thus, to under- stand the fertility decline in Bangladesh, forexample, one needs to look also at cultural boundaries. In this case, the cultural com- monality through language facilitates thespread of new ideas across the two Bengals. In turn, the strong sense of language iden-tity has facilitated mass mobilization more easily and intensely within the two Bengals. Shaped by these processes, Bangladesh andWest Bengal today are more amenable to so- cial change than many other parts of South Asia and the Middle East. Perceiving Mortality Decline MARK R. M ONTGOMERY In the demographic literature on developingcountries, studies of mortality perceptions are conspicuous by their absence. Perhaps it has been assumed that when mortality de-clines, the decline will be quickly recognized by individuals and will then influence their demographic decisions. The possibility ofsubstantial lags and biases in risk perception, which cause individual perceptions to di- verge from the changing empirical realities,has not been much considered. Yet studies in cognitive and social psychology indicate that individual mortality perceptions arelikely to be diffuse and may well be biased upward in relation to the declining empiri- cal risks. If individuals are poorly equippedto recognize mortality decline, so too may be social groups\u2014social learning will not necessarily correct individual misapprehen-sions. This note discusses the perceptual limi- tations that may delay recognition of mor- tality decline and examines the implicationsfor demographic behavior in three areas: modern health care, fertility control, and children's schooling.
