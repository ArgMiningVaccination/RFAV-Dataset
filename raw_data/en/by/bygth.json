How To Stop Sugar Cravings: Tips To Use Right Now How To Stop Sugar Cravings: Long-Term Tips When To Talk To a Healthcare Provider Sugar is one of the most widely consumed ingredients and for a good reason. It makes things taste sweeter and more appealing to our tastebuds. Plus, sugar is added to many packaged foods and beverages, and we may be unaware we're consuming so much of it. With this constant exposure, it's no wonder why craving sweets is a common experience. But is it all due to personal habits and our culture's influence, or is something else going on? This article covers possible reasons you may crave sugar, how to combat sugar cravings, and suggestions for what to eat instead that can help satisfy a sweet tooth. tk What Causes Sugar Cravings? Sugar is deeply ingrained in our food system and our daily lives. Sometimes it feels like we have no choice but to eat it, given how many foods, beverages, and snack items it's added to. Or, you may crave sweets more than you'd like. Let's look at some of the top reasons you might crave sugar. Conditioning By repeating our everyday habits, we condition our brains and bodies to do things regularly. For instance, your morning routine might consist of getting out of bed, stretching, taking supplements, and making coffee. You've probably been doing things repeatedly for so long that you don't think much about your actions. The same can go for the foods and drinks you consume. If you regularly fuel yourself with foods high in added sugar, you might eat sugar on autopilot. Consider the types of foods that make up your diet. Have you become used to eating and drinking things high in added sugar? Undereating We live in a culture that can be hyper-focused on calories, weight, and body image. There's a lot of societal pressure to restrict what we're eating. As a result, many people feel pressured to undereat or only eat certain types of foods. Not only does this take the enjoyment out of eating, but it's an unhealthy practice that can set you up for disordered eating and malnutrition. Fueling your body inadequately will leave you feeling dissatisfied and undernourished. It's common to experience cravings, particularly for higher-calorie foods rich in added sugar and fat, as your body attempts to regain any body mass it has lost. This is a survival mechanism your body employs in preparation for not being fed regularly or adequately. Artificial Sweeteners Artificial sweeteners were created to provide sweetness without the caloric addition of sugar. They can either be low or no-calorie. You'll find artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, and stevia in packets on restaurant tables, in the baking aisle at the grocery store, and used as ingredients in packaged low-calorie diet products. Many people like that artificial sweeteners allow them to eat some of their favorite sweeter foods without consuming the same calories as the non-diet version. Artificial sweeteners are 180 to 13,000 times sweeter than table sugar. Research suggests that regularly consuming artificial sweeteners can have an addictive effect by changing the balance of your gut bacteria, leading to feeling less satisfied with food. They are also associated with overeating and unintentional weight gain. Stress Have you ever gone through a bad breakup or lost your job and felt the urge to eat ice cream right out of the carton? If so, you're not alone. A common response to feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or otherwise emotional is to find comfort in food. Comfort foods for stress could be sweet or savory, depending on your preferences. But they are commonly high in added sugar, strengthening the association of sugar as a stress reducer for our brain. This can further promote sugar cravings in times of stress. One study found that excessive sugar consumption may impact the brain in a way that makes people under stress more vulnerable to ongoing sugar cravings. Sleep Being sleep-deprived can promote sugar cravings, impacting the brain's dopamine-activated reward pathways. So when you're dragging from lack of sleep, your brain may be more likely to tell you to find quick ways to feel better, like a sugar rush. Studies have also found that diets high in saturated fat, added sugar, and low in fiber have been associated with poor sleep. So if you're not sleeping well, craving sugar, and then eating sugary foods, it could perpetuate the problem. Period Cravings Approaching the start of your period and craving all the chocolate? It's common for women to crave sweets and other sugary carbs as part of their menstrual cycle due to hormone fluctuations. Research suggests that the increase in estrogen and progesterone leading up to your period is responsible for sugar cravings. Cravings tend to start 7-10 days before your period starts, and then they begin to wane. Additionally, when you eat sugary, comforting foods, your brain releases the chemical messenger serotonin. Serotonin is associated with feelings of happiness, which may be especially beneficial when you're starting your period and feeling crummy. Sugar Addiction Some studies have found parallels between how the brain responds to addictive drugs and how it responds to consuming sugar. Sugar activates the brain's reward system, which triggers us to crave more. Ultimately, this can create a disconnection between our behavior (cravings) and actual caloric needs, potentially leading to sugar addiction and overeating. In one study, the authors conclude that there is strong evidence that sugar addiction is real. They also state that sugar addiction should be considered a natural part of human evolution and survival when food is hard to find. What Is Sugar Withdrawal? Can You Rewire Your Cravings? While there's something to be said about retraining your palate, resisting all of your sugar cravings all at once may promote more of them\u2014at least in the short term. Evidence suggests that, in the long run, learning to resist your sugar cravings can help recondition your sugary habits. In the meantime, finding a happy medium that allows some sweets as part of an overall nutrient-rich diet may help make the transition easier. After all, food wasn't just meant to nourish the body; it was also meant to bring us joy. If we can find a healthy way to do that, there shouldn't be any shame or guilt in indulging in the foods we enjoy. How To Stop Sugar Cravings: Tips To Use Right Now Reducing and eventually stopping sugar cravings can take time. Here are some ways to begin retraining your palate and rewiring your brain. Don't go \"cold turkey\": While this approach may work for some, allow yourself to enjoy some small treats rather than completely removing everything you want all at once. Eliminating sugar from your diet \"cold turkey\" may trigger sugar withdrawal. Combine foods: Sometimes, combinations can offer healthy foods with a bit of sweetness that can soothe a craving. For instance, try dipping apples or strawberries in chocolate or eating a handful of walnuts with chocolate chips and raisins. Read food labels: If one of your biggest obstacles is not knowing how much added sugar you eat, reading labels instantly creates awareness. You may be surprised that foods labeled \"natural\" or \"healthy\" are laden with added sugar. Get your mind off it: Sometimes, we crave sugar out of sheer boredom. Take a quick walk or exercise and see how you feel when you return. Drink some water: We often misinterpret our need for hydration as a desire to eat. Try drinking some water to see if it helps reduce your sugar craving. Nap instead: Feeling tired and lazy? This can be an optimal time for a sugar craving to arise. Instead, take an afternoon nap and recharge. Make a swap: Rather than your go-to sugary treat, try something else that can help satisfy a craving. For instance, try a healthier alternative, like fruit, dark chocolate, or homemade trail mix. Eat regularly: Skipping meals can set you up for more cravings as your body goes into survival mode. Continue to eat regular meals, as this can help keep you satisfied. How to Reduce Sugar Intake How To Stop Sugar Cravings: Long-Term Tips Another approach is to find ways to stop sugar cravings before they start. These might include: Skip artificial sweeteners: Leaning on ultra-sweet artificial sweeteners can potentially worsen cravings for real sugar.Reward yourself: Choose a non-food item rather than rewarding yourself with sugary treats when you reach certain milestones in your life. For instance, you could take yourself to the movies or buy a pair of headphones you've been wanting. This can help retrain your brain to look forward to these things versus sugar.Slow down: Diet culture can be loud and distracting. Try to practice mindfulness, focusing on what you're eating and listening to your own body as much as possible,Get support: Habits are hard to change, especially on our own. If you live with someone or have a friend who struggles with similar sugar cravings, take on this change together. Accountability buddies can be instrumental in your progress.Try multiple strategies: There's rarely a quick fix for anything we want to change. Something may work for a little while but then prove to be unsuccessful. Don't be afraid to pivot and try something new or a combination of approaches until you find something that works for you.Go easy on yourself: Getting a handle on sugar cravings is not easy. Be patient with yourself as you see which approaches work\u2014and which don't. Try not to feel shame or guilt associated with sugar cravings, as they are very common and involve many factors. 6 Ways To Cut Back on Your Added Sugar Intake When To Talk To a Healthcare Provider Sugar cravings are normal on their own and don't indicate an underlying health problem. However, if you're concerned about your sugar consumption and how it's impacting your health, speak with a healthcare provider. If you're struggling with disordered eating or otherwise experiencing challenges practicing healthy eating habits, a combination of a registered dietitian and mental health therapist can help. Summary Several things can contribute to sugar cravings, from stress to conditioning to undereating. If you're concerned about sugar cravings, the first step is to identify what factors are at play in your life. Then, plan to address them, including stress management, therapy, sleep regimen improvement, and eating more regularly. Try not to feel guilty about sugar cravings\u2014we all have them. 12 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
