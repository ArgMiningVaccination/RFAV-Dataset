We use various ingredients such as soy wax, pure essential oils, crystals and dried flowers or herbs to make these gentle creations that soothe, calm and uplift. Many candles and wax melts give off lots of unpleasant chemicals when burnt or melted. Some are harmful and not at all good for us. Also some are found to contain animal products! Neither of which we want in our homes. Our creations are from natural products and intentionally kind and chemical free with the addition of pure essential oils, flowers and crystals they can actually help us and not harm us as they basically are from nature. All of our candles and wax melts are hand poured and make beautiful natural gifts for yourself or others. Our candles come in clear reusable glass jars and measure 65mm in height and 50mm in width. They have an average burning time 15 hours. All of our products are cruelty free and vegan friendly. "}
