The screening provides risk markers for diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and obesity. Often through these screenings, individuals with critical risk are identified and referred to their private physician for follow-up testing. For all others, the testing serves to determine risk levels and reinforce the need for regular preventive exams. Biometric Blood Test (fasting or non-fasting) The fasting test includes total cholesterol, HDL (good cholesterol), LDL (bad cholesterol), glucose, triglycerides, and a heart disease risk ratio. The non- fasting blood test eliminates the LDL and Triglycerides since these are affected by food consumption. Result health counseling is provided at the time of testing. Approximately 15 to 20 minutes is needed to complete the screening. Biometric Add-ons: A1c Diabetes screening can be incorporated for individuals found to have high-glucose readings. This screening provides a snapshot of blood glucose levels over the past 3-months without the need for fasting. Biometrics Data Management Encourage employees to get their annual preventive exam. HFC provides forms for the doctor to complete and incorporates the data collected from those onsite to provide a complete risk analysis of the population. LabCorp Biometric Screening If you have employees scattered throughout the US or employees in the field, consider HFC's LabCorp voucher program for biometric screenings. Employees obtain a voucher and can schedule an appointment at any lab throughout the US to receive the biometric screening. HFC will incorporate the results with the screening data collected on-site. Bone Density According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation (www.nof.org), approximately 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, and another 44 million have low bone density, placing them at increased risk. While osteoporosis is common among white women, men and women of all races can have the disease. Also, while the condition is more common in older people, it can strike at any age. Ultrasound assesses the bone density of the heel bone. DermaScan Skin Damage Assessment According to the American Academy of Dermatology (www.aad.org) Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States. It is estimated that approximately 9,500 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with skin cancer every day. HFC's DermaScan screenings provide a visualization (with UV Black Light) into the deeper layers of the skin where damage resides. As a glimpse into the future, participants can see the damage working its way to the surface of the skin. Staff provides education on preventive skin care. Health Risk Assessment Often combined with biometric screenings, a Personal Health Risk Assessment (HRA) enables individuals to obtain information on their general health risks. Individuals are given a score out of 100, reflecting their risk profile. The lower their score, the higher their risk. The company gets an aggregate view of the reported risks. Available as a paper version or accessible online. Hearing Screening Hearing loss can be so insidious often those experiencing it are the last to know! A licensed audiologist conducts HFC's onsite audiology service. Basic or full audiological screenings are available. Lung Fit Test Lung fitness is measured by one's ability to move air both in force and volume in and out of the lungs. Smoking and chronic lung disease will limit air exchange. This screening is an excellent eye-opener for smokers as it will show them their lung age compared to non-smokers. Great to pair with the Kick-it! Smoking Cessation station. Vision Screening Do you have a keen eye? Put your vision to the test. Near and far vision is measured. Corrective wear can also be assessed. 9 888.684.6064 / www.tryhfc.comhealth screenings to detect risk, prevent or prolong the onset of illness and disease health screenings to detect risk, prevent or prolong the onset of illness and disease 10 888.684.6064 / www.tryhfc.com A Better You: Life & Health Coaching You know where you want to go, but you might need some directions to get there.

HFC is a Certified Woman-Owned Business Entity dedicated to the prevention of disease through early detection, education, and support services to foster positive lifestyle change. HFC uses only the highest standard of health professionals (Registered Nurses, Registered Dietitians) to deliver most of its services. These professionals provide immediate results and explain the results directly to the recipients of services. HFC has served thousands of employer groups and hundreds of thousands of employees and, in many cases, has saved lives with the detection of acute conditions (high blood pressure, high blood sugar, skin cancer). HFC's clientele consists of Fortune 500 companies across the U.S., employers of all sizes, and major insurance companies such as Aetna, Cigna, Oxford, and UnitedHealthcare, among others. HFC's efficient and time-tested delivery systems enable it to offer low minimums and responsiveness to serve small and large employers, often with short notice. Thank you for considering HFC to assist you with your wellness efforts. Having graduated from high school with training to become a Licensed Practical Nurse, I was one of the lucky ones who knew my calling early in life. I went on to become an RN and complete my Master's training combining nursing, psychology, and exercise science. My years working in a critical care hospital setting provided invaluable insight into the power of prevention in avoiding illness. In 1985, I stepped away from the stability of a hospital job to bring my passion for prevention to people before they succumbed to illness. HFC was born, and I am proud to say still going strong! As a woman-owned business entity, we pride ourselves on our caring, flexible approach to wellness. Our services have evolved over the years to meet the changing wellness landscape. HFC has a big company reach with a small company touch! Order one service, or allow us to build a comprehensive suite of wellness services to optimize the health of your employees. It is our goal to provide education and services aimed at reducing risk, enhancing health and life experience, and drive employees to seek regular preventive care. We look forward to bringing our expertise to your employees. Be Well, Kathy Freeman, RN, MS, Ed PresidentAbout Health Fitness Concepts Letter from the "}
