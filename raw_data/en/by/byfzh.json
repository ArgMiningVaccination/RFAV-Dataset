WADE , ) Plaintiff ) v. ) Civil Action No. ) MEMORANDUM OPINIO N CAROLYN W. COLVIN, ) of ) Social Security, ) By: PAMELA MEADE SARGENT Defendant ) United States Magistrate Judge I. Background and Standard of Review Plaintiff, Shirley F. Wade , (\"Wade \"), filed this action challenging the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, (\"Commissioner\"), denying her claims for disability insurance benefits, (\"DIB\"), and supplemental security income, (\"SSI\"), under the Social Security Act, as amended, (\"Act\"), 42 U.S.C .A. \u00a7\u00a7 423 and 1381 et seq. (West 2011 & West 2012). Jurisdiction of this court is pursuant to 42 U .S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and 1383(c)(3). This case is before the undersigned magistrate judge upon transfer by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1 ). The cour t's review in this case is limited to determining if the factual findings of the Commissioner are supported by substantial evidence and were reached through application of the correct legal standards. See Coffman v. Bowen, 829 F.2d 514, 517 (4 th Cir. 1987) . Substantial evidence has been defined as \"evidence which a reasoning mind would accept as sufficient to support a particular conclusion. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\" Laws v. Celebrezze, 368 F.2d 640, 642 -2- (4th Cir. 1966). \"'If there is evidence to justify a refusal to direct a verdict were the case before a jury, then there is \"substantial evidence.\"'\" Hays v. Sullivan, 907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting Laws , 368 F.2d a t 642). The record shows that Wade protectively filed her applications for SSI and DIB on February 3, 2010 , alleging disability as of December 2, 2009 , due to lung problems, female problems, back problems and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (\"COPD\") . (Record , (\"R.\"), at 59, 181 -82, 188- 94, 211 .) The claims were denied initially and upon reconsideration. (R. at 99-101, 106- 08, 113 -15, 119, 120 - 22, 124- 29, 131 -33.) Wade then requested a hearing before an administrative law judge, (\"ALJ\") . (R. at 134 .) A hearing was held on March 26 , 2012 , at which Wade was represented by counsel. (R. at 31 -58.) By decision dated June 6, 2012, the ALJ denied Wade's claim s. (R. at 16- 25.) The ALJ found that Wade met the disability insured status requirements of the Act for DIB purposes through June 30, 2013 . (R. at 18.) The ALJ found that Wade had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since December 2 , 2009 , the alleged onset date . (R. at 18.) The ALJ found that the medical evidence established that Wade had severe impairments, namely degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine , COPD, right shoulder tear, depression and anxiety , but the ALJ found that Wade did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled one of the liste d impairments in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, S ubpart P, Appendix 1. (R. at 18-19.) The ALJ found that Wade had the residual functional capacity to perform simple, routine, repetitive, light work ,1 1 Light work involves lifting items weighing up to 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of items weighing up to 10 pounds. If s omeone can perform light work, s he also can perform sedentary work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b), 416.967( b) (2013). that required her to -3- only occasionally climb ladders, ropes, scaffolds, ramps or stairs, occasionally stoop, kneel, crouch or crawl and reach overhead with her right upper extremity , that did not require concentrated exposure to extreme cold, heat, humidity and irritants such as fumes, gases, odors, dust or poorly ventila ted areas and that required only occasional interact ion with the public and co-workers. (R. at 20.) The ALJ found that Wade was able to perform her past relevant work as an assembler/auto manufacturer . (R. at 23.) In addition, based on Wade's age, education, work h istory and residual functional capacity and the testimony of a vocational expert, the ALJ found that a significant number of jobs existed that Wade could perform , including jobs as a merchandise marker, a checker or warehouse checker and an office mail cle rk. (R. at 24.) Thus , the ALJ concluded that Wade was not under a disability as defined by the Act and was not eligible for DIB or SSI benefits. (R. at 24-25.) See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520( f), (g), 416.920( f), (g) (201 3). After the ALJ issued his decision, Wade pursued her administrative appeals, (R. at 10), but the Appeals Council denied her request for review. (R. at 1 -3.) Wade then filed this action seeking review of the ALJ's unfavorable decision, which now stands as the Commissioner's final decision. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.981, 416.1481 (201 3). This case is before this court on Wade's motion for summary judgment filed October 28, 2013, and the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment filed February 14 , 2014. II. Facts Wade was born in 19 58, (R. at 59, 181, 188), which , at the time of the ALJ's decision, classified her as a \"person closely approaching advanced age \" under 20 -4- C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1563( d), 416.963( d). Wade has a high school education and vocational training as a certified nurse's assistant. (R. at 212.) She has past work experience as a home attendant, a nurse's aide , a machine operator and an assembler . (R. at 213.) Wade testified at her hearing that she had attempted suicide twice by medication overdose. (R. at 40.) She stated that she was receiving treatment from Scott County Behavioral Health on a monthly basis. (R. at 41.) Wade stated that, despite taking medication, she still experienced panic attacks. (R. at 41.) Vocational expert, Mark Heilman , testified at Wade's hearing. (R. at 49- 57.) Heilman stated that Wade's past work as a nurse's aide, machine operator, home attendant and residential tech were medium ,2 2 Medium work involves lifting items weighing up to 50 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of items weighing up to 25 pounds. If an individual can do medium work, s he also can do sedentary and light work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(c), 416.967(c) (2013 ). semi -skilled work, that her job as an assembler was light, unskilled work and her jobs as a checker and marker were medium, unskilled. (R. at 52-53.) The ALJ asked Heilman to consider a hypothetical individual who could perform simple, routine, repetitive light work, who could only occasionally climb ladders, ropes, scaffolds, ramps and stairs, who could occasionally stoop, kne el, crouch and crawl, who could occasionally engage in overhead reaching with the right upper extremity, who should avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold and heat, humidity and irritants, such as fumes, odors, dusts, gases and poorly ventilated areas, who had no postural limitations and who could perform tasks requir ing only occasional interaction with the public and co-worker s. (R. at 5 3-54.) Heilman testified that such an individual could perform Wade's past work as a window parts assembler . (R. at 5 4.) Heilman also identified jobs that existed in significant numbers at the light, unskilled level -5- that such an individual could perform , including jobs as a marker or merchandise marker, a checker or warehouse checker and an office mail clerk. (R. at 5 4-55.) Heilman stated that there would be no jobs available that the individual could perform should the individual miss three or more days of work per month, be off ta sk 20 to 25 percent of the work day or had marked limitations in his abilities to maintain attention and concentration, to be reliable and to complete a normal workday or work week. (R. at 5 5-57.) In rendering his decision, the ALJ reviewed records Dr. John Sadler, M.D., a state agency physician; Dr. Michael Hartman, M.D., a state agency physician; Wellmont Holston Valley Medical Center; Mountain Region Family Medicine ; Dr. Robert Rosser, M.D.; Dr. Nazia I. Shehzad, M.D.; University of Virginia Hospital; and Frontier Health.

Dr. Sadler found that Wade could frequently crouch. (R. at 64.) No manipulative, visual or communicative limitations were noted. (R. at 64.) Dr. Sadler found that Wade should avoid concentrated exposure to temperature extremes, humidity and work hazards, including moving machinery -8- and heights. (R. at 64- 65.) He also found that Wade should avoid moderate exposure to fumes, odors, d usts, gases and poor ventilation. (R. at 65.) On November 2, 2010, Dr. Michael Hartman, M.D., a state agency physician, found that Wade had the residual functional capacity to perform light work. (R. at 75 -77.) He found that Wade could occasionally climb ladders, ropes and scaffolds, stoop and crawl. (R. at 75 -76.) No manipulative, visual or communicative limitations were noted. (R. at 76.)

Wade was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia and nicotine dependence. (R. at 444.) Wade's then- current Global Assessment of Functioning score, (\"GAF\"), 4 was assessed at 45.5 4 The GAF scale ranges from zero to 100 and \"[c]onsider[s] psychological, social, and occupational functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health -illness.\" DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS FOURTH EDITION , (\"DSM -IV\"), 32 (American Psychiatric Association 1994).

(R. at 440.) On December 5 A GAF score of 41- 50 indicates that the individual has \" [s]erious symptoms ... OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioni ng....\" See DSM -IV at 32. -9- 21, 2010, Wade reported that she was doing well and that the medication was helping with her mood.

On April 14, 2011, Wade reported doing well, stating that she had been working in the yard. (R. at 431.) She exhibited a euthymic mood and congruent affect. (R. at 431.) On December 10, 2010, Wade saw Dr. Nazia I. Shehzad, M.D., to establish a treatment relationship for complaints of depression, sleep disturbance, short- term memory problems and back pain. (R. at 382 -86.) Examination revealed that Wade was alert, oriented and depressed looking. (R. at 383.)

(R. at 410.) Dr. Shehzad did not attribute Wade's disability to a mental or physical impairment. (R. at 410.) On another form titled, \"Phy sician's Certification of Handicapped Status,\" Dr. Shehzad indicated that Wade's impairments were of such nature that her ability to live independently could be improved by more suitable housing conditions. (R. at 411.) Dr. Shehzad did not attribute Wade's disability to a mental or physical impairment. (R. at 411.) Dr. Shehzad notes lists no restrictions on Wade's work-related abilities. On September 2 2, 2011, when Wade was in the midst of divorce proceedings and relocating, she took an overdose of Fioricet, but denied attempting suicide. (R. at 426, 510- 12.)

Shehzad referred Wade to a pain management specialist. (R. at 497.) On August 22, 2012, Sabrina Mitchell, F.N .P., a family nurse practitioner who worked with Dr. Shehzad, completed an assessment indicating that Wade could lift and carry items weighing up to 10 pounds. (Plaintiff's Brief In Support -12- Of Motion For Summary Judgment, (\"Plaintiff's Brief\"), Docket Item No. 11, Att. I.) She reported that Wade could stand and/or walk a total of 30 minutes to one hour at a time and that she could do so for up to 3 0 minutes without interruption. (Plaintiff's Brief, Docket Item No. 11, Att. I.) Mitchell reported that Wade could sit two to three hours in an eight- hour workday and that she could do so for 30 minutes to one hour without interruption. (Plaintiff's Brief, Docket Item No. 11, Att. I.) Mitchell opined that Wade could occasionally balance and never climb, stoop, kneel, crouch or crawl. (Plaintiff's Brief, Docket Item No. 11, Att. I.) She opined that Wade's abilities to reach, to handle, to feel and to push an d pull were affected by her impairments. (Plaintiff's Brief, Docket Item No. 11, Att. I.) Mitchell found that Wade was restricted from working around heights, moving machinery, temperature extremes, chemicals, dust, fumes, humidity and vibration. (Plaintif f's Brief, Docket Item No. 11, Att. I.) On February 14, 2012, Wade was seen by Dr. Thomas G. Sutton, M.D., at the Pain Management Center of the University of Virginia Health System. (R. at 516-20.) An MRI of Wade's right shoulder confirmed that she had moderate focal tendinopathy of the anterior infraspinatus, tendinosis and a superior labral tear. (R. at 521.) Wade reported that her depression and anxiety were somewhat better controlled since she started taking medication. (R. at 516.) Wade reported that her back pain was slightly better with Lortab and worsened with activity, particularly bending over and upon leaning. (R. at 516.) Dr. Sutton noted that Wade's headaches were well -controlled. (R. at 516.) Wade had some lumbar spine tenderness, negative Pat rick's test, 6 6 Patrick's test is a test in which the sacroiliac joint is stressed, used to determine the presence of sacroiliac disease. See STEDMAN 'S MEDICAL DICTIONARY , (\"Stedman's\"), 613 (1995). a slow but normal gait, full strength except for nearly full strength in her left hip flexion, intact sensation in all extremities and -13- reduced active range of motion in her right shoulder. (R. at 518.) Dr. Sutton ordered a denervation procedure and recommended only NSAIDS for Wade's back pain and arthritis. (R. at 518 -19.) III. Analysis The Commissioner uses a five -step process in evaluating DIB and SSI claims. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920 (201 3). See also , 461 U.S. 458, 460- 62 (1983); Hall v. Harris , 658 F.2d 260, 264 -65 (4th Cir. 1981). This process requires the Commissioner to consider, in order, whether a claimant 1) is working; 2) has a severe impairment; 3) has an impairment that meets or equals the requirements of a listed impairment; 4) can return to her past relevant work; and 5) if not, whether s he can perform other work. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. If the Commissioner finds conclusively that a claimant is or is not disabled at any point in this process, review does not proceed to the next step. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), 416.920(a) (201 3). Under this analysis, a claimant has the initial burden of showing that she is unable to return to her past relevant work because of her impairments. Once the claimant establishes a prima facie case of disability, the burden shifts to the Commissioner. To satisfy this burden, the Commissioner must then establish that the claimant has the residual functional capacity, considering the claim ant's age, education, work experience and impairments, to perform alternative jobs that exist in the national economy. See 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A), F.2d 866, 868- 69 Cir. 1983); Hall, 658 F.2d at 264 -65; Wilson v. Califano, 617 F.2d 1050, 1053 (4th Cir. 1980). -14- In her brief, Wade argues that the ALJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence . (Plaintiff's Brief at 10-14.) Wade argues that the ALJ erred by giving the opinions of Drs. Sadler and Hartman greater weight. (Plaintiff's Brief at 10 -14.) Wade also argues that the Appeals Council erred by failing to address new and material evidence. (Plaintiff's Brief at 14- 18.) As stated above, the court's function in this case is limited to determining whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support the ALJ's findings. This court must not weigh the evidence, as this court lacks authority to substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner, provided her decisi on is sup ported by substantial evidence. See Hays , 907 F.2d at 1456 . In determining whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner's decision, the court also must consider whether the ALJ analyzed all of the relevant evidence and whether the ALJ sufficiently explained his findings and his rationale in crediting evid ence. See Sterling Smokeless Coal Co. v. Akers, 131 F.3d 438, 439- 40 (4 th Cir. 1997). Wade argues that the ALJ erred by giving the opinions of Drs. Sadler and Hartman greater weight. (Plaintiff's Brief at 10- 14.) Both Dr. Hartman and Dr. Sadler opined th at Wade had the residual functional capacity to perform light work with certain postural and environmental limitations. (R. at 63-65, 75 -77.) The ALJ found their opinions to be consistent with, and well -supported by , the medical evidence of record. (R. at 22.) A medical opinion is entitled to greater weight when it is supported by relevant evidence, \"particularly medical signs and laboratory findings,\" and when it is consistent with the \"record as whole.\" See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c)(2) -(4), 416.927(c)(2) -(4) (2013). A medical opinion from an acceptable treating source is given \"controlling\" weight only when it is \"well-supported\" by \"medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic findings\" -15- and when it is \"not inconsistent\" with the other \"substantial\" evi dence , 416.927(c)(2) . The ALJ found that Wade had the residual functional capacity to perform light work with certain postural and environmental limitations. (R. at 20.) Dr. Shehzad completed a Physician's Certification of Disability indicating that Wade was disabled from all substantial gainful activity due to a disability that could be improved by more suitable housing conditions. (R. at 410.) Dr. Shehzad did not attribute Wade's di sability to a mental or physical impairment. (R. at 410.) On another form titled, \"Physician's Certification of Handicapped Status,\" Dr. Shehzad indicated that Wade's impairments were of such nature that her ability to live independently could be improved by more suitable housing conditions. (R. at 411.) Again, Dr. Shehzad did not attribute Wade's disability to a mental or physical impairment. (R. at 411.) Dr. Shehzad's notes list no restrictions on Wade's work-related abilities. In fact, c linical tests showed no acute chest abnormalities, and Wade's COPD and emphysema did well with medication. (R. at 29 2, 295, 302, 323 , 326, 334, 350, 355, 368 -69, 372, 377-78.) MRI tests confirmed Wade had arthritis, but examination generally showed that she had norm al or mildly reduced range of motion, negative straight leg raising tests and a normal gait. (R. at 293, 295, 332 - 33, 372, 378, 383, 516, 518- 19.) Wade's pain management specialist conducted a denervation procedure and then recommended only NSAIDS for her back pain and arthritis . (R. at 518 -19.) Wade also reported that her headaches were well- controlled with medication. (R. at 378, 518 -19.) Antidepressant medications significantly improved Wade's depressive symptoms and she repeatedly reported that she was doing well. (R. at 33 3, 431, 433- 37, 488-89, 516 .) \"If a symptom can -16- be reasonably controlled by medication or treatment, it is not disabling.\" Gross v. Heckler, 785 F.2d 1163, 1166 (4th Cir. 1986). Based on this, I find that the ALJ properly weigh ed the medical evidence. Wade also argues that the Appeals Council erred by failing to address new and material evidence from Sabrina Mitchell, a family nurse practitioner. (Plaintiff's Brief at 14- 18.) The Appeals Council did consider this evidence in declining to review the ALJ' s decision. (R. at 1-3.) That being the case, this court also must consider this evidence in determining whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ's decision. See Wilkin s v. Sec'y of Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 953 F.2d 93, 96 (4 th Cir. 1991). The Appeals Council found that Mitchell's assessment did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ's decision. (R. at 1.) Based on my review of Mitchell's assessment and of the medical evidence of record, I agree. As noted above, Wade's physical examinations generally showed that she had normal range of motion, nega tive straight leg raising tests and a normal gait. (R. at 293, 295, 332-33, 372, 378, 383, 516, 518-19.) In fact, other than the state agency physicians, none of Wade's treating physicians placed any limitations on her work-related abilities. It is for al l of these reasons that I find that substantial evidence supports the ALJ's findings when considering the whole record, including the assessment from Mitchell . Thus, I find that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner's decision to deny benefits. An appropriate order will be entered.
