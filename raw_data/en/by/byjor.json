The number of Alabamians admitted to a hospital due to COVID increased nearly 50% in just one week, from 216 weekly hospital admissions in the second week of August to 318 hospital admissions in the third week of August, according to [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker) (CDC) data. That's an increase of 134% from mid-July, when the state recorded 136 hospital admissions that week. The average number of patients hospitalized in Alabama also increased 18% in one week. It rose from a 7-day average of 195 hospitalizations in mid-August to averaging 230 hospitalizations a week later. In mid-July, there were less than 100 Alabamians hospitalized due to COVID.

In the fall of 2021, up to [3,000 people were hospitalized each day](https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2021/12/22/covid-alabama-coronavirus-cases-hospitals-schools-omicron-variant/8998336002/) for COVID. Danne Howard, deputy director of the Alabama Hospital Association, said the recent increase did not put the same kind of stress on hospitals that earlier phases of the virus did. \"One thing is, it's not the same as the Delta variant and the virus originally where folks were on life support and ventilators,\" Howard said. The virus has killed [over 22,000 people](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_deaths-total) in the state since the first Alabama COVID case was confirmed on March 13, 2020. While hospitals continue to face a workforce shortage, an issue that the COVID pandemic highlighted, Howard said hospitals have been able to handle the increased COVID hospitalizations because the current wave seems to be less severe than past waves. \"We don't need to make light of the surge that's going on and the increased numbers right now, but we're not at a capacity issue right now that is worrisome,\" she said. Compared to a peak in hospital admissions in January 2022, current numbers are down 89% in Alabama. Hospitalizations are also down 92% from that time. John Matson, spokesperson for the Alabama Nursing Home Association, also said that nursing homes aren't as strained as they were during previous waves. Because nursing homes have federal COVID testing guidelines, he said they have able to stay on top of it. \"But we have not heard any nursing homes report to us that they're having trouble covering shifts or having enough caregivers on hand to meet the needs of the residents and patients, and that's a good thing,\" Matson said. In the second week of August, nursing homes in Alabama recorded 188 COVID cases, according to [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data) (CMS) data, a 32% increase from 142 cases the week prior. Matson also said that the current wave has not stressed nursing homes as previous waves have, but that he is seeing more nursing homes implement masking policies now. \"Talking to our members, more are masking now then were a month two months ago, and just trying to be cautious, practice common sense again,\" he said. Laura Hart, executive director of the Alabama State Nurse Association, said in an interview Tuesday that she spoke to a nurse from central Alabama that morning. The nurse currently works for a hospital that is considering a mandatory masking policy. \"She's the first person I've talked to who's brought it up to me,\" Hart said. \"It's institution specific how they apply the guidelines and so they may not be all mandatory masking at this time.\" Dr. Wes Stubblefield, the district medical officer at Alabama Department of Public Health, said in a text message that ADPH will continue to provide the bivalent COVID vaccine upon request, and that they were pre-purchased by the federal government and will remain free and available until a new, updated vaccine is available in the fall. He said they are predicting a release in September or October. About [8% of Alabamians are up-to-date](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-states-jurisdictions) on their COVID vaccines, meaning they received the bivalent COVID booster, according to the CDC. The national average is about 17%. Once the updated vaccine is released in the fall, \"the bivalent vaccine will no longer be authorized and the new vaccine will be distributed in the commercial market much like the flu vaccine,\" Stubblefield said. The updated vaccine is expected to cost [$110 to $130 per dose](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-department-asks-reasonable-prices-updated-covid-shots-2023-07-13/#:~:text=While%20Moderna%20and%20Pfizer%20have,a%20dose%20for%20their%20vaccines.), according to Reuters, but Stubblefield said that will depend on the individual's insurance and vaccine coverage. For uninsured and underinsured individuals, health departments will provide free vaccines through a federal [Bridge Access Program](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-hhs-announces-hhs-bridge-access-program-covid-19-vaccines-treatments-maintain-access-covid-19-care-uninsured.html). Underinsured persons may have health insurance, but the insurance does not include any vaccines, covers only selected vaccines or does not provide first-dollar coverage for vaccines.
