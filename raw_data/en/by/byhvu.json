Verywell / Sabrina Jiang Aches and pains can get in the way of living your best life and doing workouts and every day tasks. Pain relief creams can temporarily quell inflammation or reduce pain when applied directly to the skin. \"Not all pain is the same,\" said Susan Bard, MD, a dermatologist at Vive Dermatology, explaining that different pain relievers meet different needs. Some help reduce inflammation while others are more suitable for open wounds like cuts and scrapes. You'll want to pay close attention to the active and other ingredients used in the product. Look carefully at the ingredients in pain relief creams, including any fragrances, especially if you have sensitivities or allergies. We reviewed the creams in our roundup based on their active ingredients, whether or not they contain natural ingredients and scents, and how they feel; if they're greasy or sticky, or if they feel cool or warm. We also had a physical therapist from our Review Board review the contents of this article for accuracy regarding the efficacy of ingredients and how to avoid unwanted side effects. Here are the best pain relief creams on the market, based on your needs.

This potency allows the cream to deliver an intense cooling sensation, which then makes the skin feel warm as it wears off. The cream also contains a salicylate called methyl salicylate, so you can expect a little extra pain relief from this formula. Price at time of publication: $9 What are salicylates? Salicylates are NSAIDs\u2014non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\u2014that quell pain and inflammation. But you want to exercise caution when using them.

Remember: It is possible to overdo it with salicylates, so exercise caution when using a salicylate-based pain relief cream and carefully follow the product instructions. Price at time of publication: $7 Best with Lidocaine Aspercreme Pain Relieving Creme With Lidocaine Amazon View On Amazon View On Walmart View On Herbspro.com Pros Effectively numbs to relieve pain Feels like a lotion No menthol scent Cons Bottle is difficult to open Each application requires a lot of product Most pain relief creams will only relieve your pain, but this Aspercreme formula includes lidocaine, which actually numbs it. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that blocks nerves' abilities to send pain signals to your brain. This ingredient makes the cream a particularly effective pain reliever. Similar to salicylates, you can overuse lidocaine, so be mindful when using products containing it and carefully read the instructions on their labels. Price at time of publication: $10 Final Verdict Penetrex's Therapy Cream (view at Amazon) is loaded with natural ingredients that soothe pain effectively. And since the anti-inflammatory cream is non-greasy and non-staining, you can apply it without worrying about making a mess. It's also suitable for sensitive skin, unlike creams that rely on counterirritants. What to Look for in a Pain Relief Cream Active Ingredients Different pain relief creams rely on different active ingredients to get the job done. Be sure to select a pain relief cream that suits your specific type of pain. And exercise caution with salicylate- or lidocaine-based creams, as it is possible to overuse these pain-relieving agents. Natural Ingredients \"Try to stay as natural as possible,\" said Dr. Jaliman. Natural ingredients can help you minimize the risk of irritation, especially if you have allergies or sensitive skin. Fragrance \"As with any topical product you apply to the skin, be cautious in using products that have fragrances,\" said Dr. Zeichner. Fragrances may cause skin irritation, especially for people with sensitive skin. Frequently Asked Questions How do pain relief creams work? Pain relief creams tend to work in one of four ways. Anti-inflammatory pain relief creams use soothing ingredients like arnica to reduce swelling. Meanwhile, counterirritating pain relief creams draw on ingredients like menthol and camphor to cool the skin.Some pain relief creams use salicylates, a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to block a key enzyme in the inflammation process. And other pain relief creams numb the skin with a local anesthetic called lidocaine. Can I use pain relief cream while pregnant? You can use pain relief creams powered by lidocaine safely so long as you follow the directions on the product label.Scientific studies have yet to confirm whether camphor is safe for use during pregnancy, so it's best to be cautious and avoid pain relief creams that feature it.There are no human studies to determine whether menthol is truly safe during pregnancy, but the risk is considered low when the menthol concentration in a pain relief cream is low. If you want to use a methol-powered pain relief cream, consult with your doctor first.While oral arnica consumption is problematic during pregnancy, topical use is generally recognized as safe. However, if you have concerns, consult with your doctor before using these types of pain relief creams.Lastly, you should avoid NSAID-based pain relief creams during your third trimester. Methyl salicylate, a common active ingredient in these products, is absorbed into the body via the skin and can cause harm to the baby and complications during delivery. Why Trust Verywell Fit?
