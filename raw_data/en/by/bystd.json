What is meant by having a \"scientific\" understanding of health and medicine versus other ways of knowing? 2. Compare and contrast the following adjective s as applied to medicine: alternative, complementary, i ntegrative, holistic, natural, regular, unconventional, and traditional . What does each adjective tell us about the origins, applications, and scope of these medicines? What do they tell us about bias in the dominant medical system? 3. What were the earliest types of books to be printed in the American colonies during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? Why do you suppose these books were selected for popular publication? 4.

Chapter 4 \u2014CAM in Community 1. Give examples of which kinds of therapeutic modalities labeled as complementary/alternative could be offered in mainstream medi cal set tings, and which could not be. 2. Describe some models of new practice settings that could authentically \"integrate\" CAM mod alities into mainstream medical practice . 3. Discuss the pros and cons of \"integrating\" CAM therapeutic modalities into the mainstre am healthcare system vs. accessing them as independent resources in the community . 4. Outline approaches to expanding the role of community and social workers in a broader model of health and healing beyond the parameters of what is defined as the existing healthcare system .

What did Carl Jung mean by having the words carved over his doorway, \"summoned or unsummoned, G -d will be there\"? 5. In the 1970s, why was Zen (Chinese) practice seen as more mature than Hi ndu psychedelic practice? 6. Emerson and Thoreau were both captivated by Eastern modes of thought and practice, although each had a different intellectual enterprise \u2014Emerson to understand and express universal principles, and Thoreau to deepen his direct expe rience of the world in moment -by-moment particulars. Discuss the tensions between these complementary orientations and how they have continued to be important in the development of the practice of integrative medicine. Note: Also see Chapter 31 contrasting different orientations for studying ethnomedicine: early British social anthropology for finding general rules for organization of medical systems as social institutions, versus early American cultural anthropology for documenting aspects of ethnomedicine unique to beliefs and behaviors of each cultural group. 7. The US occupation of Japan immediately after World War II brought opportunities for many Western medical professionals, as well as non -professionals, to observe a paradigmatically different approach to treatment of medical and psychological disorders. What would it have been like for a physician from that era to encounter for the first time such basic Eastern insights as (1) the paradox of turning toward rather than away from symptoms for relief and ( 2) the insistence on the non -dualistic nature of the body and the mind? 8. There are three broad , chronological strokes for the ways that Eastern thought, particularly Buddhist thought, has come into contemporary culture (a) during the 1950s in an intellectu al and aesthetic focus on Zen and sudden enlightenment, (b) during the 1960s and 1970s in an ecstatic and experiential focus on Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist practice and iconography, and (c) in the 1980s and onward in an embodied focus on the psychological i nsight and gradual awakening of Theravada (Insight) Buddhism. All three are still evident in the culture at large. How does each shape the reception of CAM and integrative medicine? 9. Don Cupitt's suggestion that one's own life is now the \"privileged religio us object\" for many people today is suggested from his study of current idiomatic expressions \u2014 such as \"get a life!\" Do you see such a shift taking place?

Name three health benefits associated with regular religious participation . 4. Until the 20th century, physicians were seen as having a \"sacerdotal\" or priestly role in society and f or the patient in addition to whatever knowledge and skills they brought for the practice of medicine.

Today we are seeing an increasing degree of cooperation between practitioners of different b ackgrounds, as well as an increasing awareness of the need for preventative medicine, in both the individual and the public health setting. What role could/should naturopathic medicine play in guiding preventative policy? 5. In working in collaboration with other health care practitioners? 6. In providing individualized care? 7. We are also seeing significant overlap of the education as well as the modalities used by practitioners of different backgrounds. For example, some naturopaths now have very extensive pre scription drug authority, and some \"regular\" medical doctors receive extensive training in nutrition and functional medicine. What, if anything, do you believe clearly defines the difference between naturopathic doctors and other health care practitioners? 8. Many therapies used by naturopathic as well as allopathic doctors are lacking a solid research foundation.

Chinese medicine in the United States, and in the West in general, has predominantly transformed the idea of qi into a metaphysical entity as opposed to a complex and evanescent substance that travels throughout the body accompanied by bloo d and spirit in classic Chinese medicine. Why do you think practitioners in the West are apparently more comfortable with the idea of qi as \"energy\"? 7. Reflect on the Chinese medical tradition and the concept of holism. In what way, if any, is this medical s ystem holistic? In your opinion, is it any more or less holistic than biomedicine? Why? [see also Chapter 30] 8.

Chapter 33 \u2014Classical Acupun cture 1. How is conceptualizing qi as energy a useful way to understand the traditional Chinese paradigm, or does it obscure potentially broader meanings? 2. Very often, acupuncture concepts such as the loca tion at which needles are applied or the channels described in traditional theory are referred to using the expression \"point \" or the term \"meridian, \" respectively. Both point and meridian express the idea of arbitrary , fixed locations in space. Do you think these terms can adequately capture what the Chinese were trying to express with the words xue (\"hole\") and jing luo (\"channels and networks\"). Why or why not? 3. Contemporary western n europhysiological perspectives on acupunc ture can be said to either expand the usefulness of acupuncture or limit our understanding of this complex system. What arguments could be made for either position? 4. Based on the discussion of channel categories and pathways, do you think that acupuncture needling at non -indicated sites could be an effective placebo control for an acupuncture treatment? Why or why not? 5. It can be said that Chinese medicine views the body as a landscape or a micro -climate , or \"garden .\" Please discuss this idea from the perspective of the channels and networks.

Many traditional healing systems have a complex blend of natural, spiritual, scientific, an d supernatural theories about health and healing. How would you describe this blend of ideas and practices for Curanderismo? 5. The most important credentials for curanderos come from community acceptance and the belief that curanderos have a \"gift\" for heali ng that is not from formal classes or institutional degrees. How does the difference between the credentials of curanderos and those of physicians and nurses have an impact on their healing practices? On their acceptance and effectiveness? 6. Curanderismo has three areas of healing theory and practice: the material level ( nivel material ), the spiritual level ( nivel spiritual ), and the mental or psychic level ( nivel mental ).
