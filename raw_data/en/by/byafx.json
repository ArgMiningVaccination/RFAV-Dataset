Frye Co-chair: John S. Markowitz Major: Pharmaceutical Sciences As the popularity of herbal dietary supplements has increased, more and more multi -herb combination products have appeared on the dietary supplement market. Since the oral bioavailability of many phytochemicals is low, various dosage forms, such as nanoemulsion formulations and phosphatidylcholine- complexed softgel formulations, are being developed to im prove the bioavailability of bioactive constituents. However, there is scant clinical research on the e ffect of formulation on the bioavailability of bioconstituents in multi -herb supplements in human subjects . In the current study, we compared the bioavailability between two milk thistle - containing dietary supplements, Product B , a standard powder -filled capsule and IsaGenesis , a softgel formulation, by evaluating silybin A and silybin B as surrogate markers for differences in absorption and bioavailabili ty. For this randomized, crossover PK study, 12 healthy study participants consumed a single- dose serving (2 capsules) of each supplement separated by a washout period of at least one- week. Serial blood samples were obtained at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 h time points and analyzed by Liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS ). 12 Both formulations exhibited rapid absorption and elimination of silybin A and silybin B. However, the absorption, as indicated by mean C max values and mean plas ma AUC, were significantly higher for the IsaGenesis formulation. Relative to powder -filled Product B, the IsaGenesis softgel formulation demonstrated 365% and 450% higher mean C max, for silybin A and silybin B, respectively. On average, T max was reached at least 1 h earlier with IsaGenesis relative to Product B for both silybin A and silybin B. Our findings indicate that the IsaGenesis softgel formulation provides markedly higher absorption and bioavailability of silybin A and silybin B in comparison with the powder - filled capsule formulation, Product B. 13 CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION Dietary Supplements In the \"Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) \" of 1994, a dietary supplement represents a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more dietary ingredients [1]. DSHEA not only provides regulations for dietary supplements, but also officially defines dietary ingredients as shown in Table 1- 1. Over the past 15 years, dietary supplement use has grown steadily in the United States and across the globe [2]. Herbal supplement sales accounted for nearly 20% of the total dietary supplement sales in the U.S., and annual retail sales of these products in the U.S. exceeded $7 billion in 2016 [3] . In developed countries, herbal supplement or herbal medicine is generally referred to as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) . New CAM products are not required to undergo formal review like conventional drugs regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [4, 5] . Accordingly, many herbal supplements lack rigorous scientific evaluation relative to their safety and effectiveness. Though CAM is regulated as food, consumers often regard herbal supplements as medications for disease prevention and healthy aging [6] . For reasons including desire for wellness, fitness, and disease prevention, as well as the perception that natural alternatives are safer than conventional drugs, a substantial number of individuals turn to herbal supplements. As the popular ity of herbal dietary supplements has increased, many more multi - herb combination products have appeared on the dietary supplement market. But herbal supplements usually differ in content of phytoconstituents from batch to batch and 14 between different manuf acturers. In addition, even with standardized active constituents, there may be differences in other components, leading to variations in bioactivit y and bioavailability in humans [7] . A multi- herb supplement is a complex mixture , and it cannot be assumed that individual components within a multi -herb supplement will exert exactly the same effect(s) as they do in single- herb supplements . In 2007, the Final Rule for Current Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements issued by the FDA provides standards to ensure the identity, purity, quality, strength, and composition of dietary supplements, but it does not address minimum requirements for quality and the inherent safety of the ingredients contained in dietary products. Since dietary supplements or CAM products are regulated as food, there is no guarantee that manufacturers regist er their commercial herbal products before marketing [8, 9]. However, most of the evidence of positive effects of dietary phytochemicals is inferred from in vitro models and most of the assessments of bioactive constituents are conducted in single- herb supplements [10- 14]. The bioavailability of many phytochemicals is low after oral administration, therefore, different dosage forms, such as nanoemulsion formulations and phos phatidylcholine- complexed softgel formulations, are being bioavailability of bioactive constituents [15, 16] . To date, there is scant clinical research on the effect of different formulations on the bioavailability of phytoconstituents in multi - herb supplements in humans . Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the influence of formulation on the bioavailability of individual component in a multi -herb suppl ement. 15 Bioactivities of Milk Thistle in IsaGenesis and Product B In the current study, a softgel formulation, IsaGenesis , and a standard dry , powder -filled formulation, Product B , are investigated to determine the impact of the formulation on the bioavailability of bioactive constituents in these multi -herb supplements. IsaGenesis and Product B both contain milk thistle extract as the main ingredient , and both are mixtures of herbal extracts, vitamins and amino acids purported to promote healthy aging and r educe oxidative damage. Besides milk thistle, other herbal ingredients , such as green tea, horny goat weed, turmeric, and ashwagandha, are incorporated into these two multi -herb dietary supplements (Table 1- 2). The milk thistle fruit has been utilized to t reat liver and gallbladder disorders since ancient times [17]. The crude extract obtained from crushed seeds of the plant Silybum marianum , is termed silymarin, and contains a complex of bioactive constituents, including approximately 70% silymarin flavonolignans A and silybin B; Figure 1- 1) is the predominant and the most active constituent of silymarin. Silybin possesses diverse bioactivities: hepatoprotection, antioxidant, chemopreventive and neuroprotective effects , and it has been advocated for the treatment of alcohol - associated liver diseases [19- 21]. In animal experiments , silybin has been reported to prevent the oxidative toxicities of alcohol, acetaminophen, and phalloidin [22] . These findings imply that silybin, the predominant active constituent of silymarin , is a potent liver protectant and an effective antioxidant in therapeutic applications. Given the 16 chemical complexity of milk thistle extracts, Kroll , et al. addressed the importance of proper nomenclature [23] . In this study, silybin represents two A and silybin B while silibinin a roughly 1:1 ratio of silybin A and silybin B. Since less than 50% of orally administrated silym arin (based on silybin) was absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract due to its poor solubility in water and oil , the oral bioavailability of sili binin ( nearly 1:1 ratio of silybin A and silybin B) was reportedly only 0.73% in rat s [24-26]. Conspicuous PK variability of silymarin among clinical trial outcomes has been reported, and low oral bioavailability of silymarin likely leads to the inconsistency in clinical outcomes. Consequently, the oral bioavailabilit y of milk thistle -containing formulations is mostly considered limited and highly variable [27- 29]. Regarding low bioavailability of silybin , there possible causes: low solubility, low permeability, ext ensive phase II metabolism , and rapid excretion [30] . Thus, methods to enhance the bioavailability of silybin have been pursued as the popularity of herbal dietary supplements has increased. These methods to increase silybin bioavailability include . Since the ingredients contained in IsaGenesis and Product B have known antioxidant properties, it is possible that these two plant -based supplements could decrease oxidative stress and increase catalase concentrations in human subjects . Catalase is the first identified antioxidant enzyme involv ed in cell defense against oxidative damage by hydrogen peroxide ( H 2O2) and is the oldest known enzyme to control cellular r edox homeostasis [33]. 17 Sweazea et al. led a double- blind, placebo- controlled study to assess whether the plant -based nutraceutical (Product B) can improve antioxidant status in healthy subjects after 12 weeks [34] . Although markers of glucose and lipid regulation and most biomarkers for antioxidant capacity were not significant ly different , plasma catalase levels were significantly augmented in the treatment group (+6.1 nmol/min/mL) as compared to the control group ( -10.3 Methods to Improve Silybin Bioavailability Phytosomes Since most bioactive constituents of plants are poorly absorbed and have limited permeability , the clinical utility of these constituents is severely restrict ed [35]. A phytosome is a biocompatible complex technology incorporating phytoconstituents or standardized herbal extracts into phospholipids [36] . It has been observed that complexation with phospholipid, mainly phosphotidylcholine, can significantly improve the absorption and bioavailability of phytoconstituents [37] . Phytosomes serve as an effective drug delivery system for enhancing therapeutic index and also can represent a potent targeting agent to transport the encapsulated bioactive compounds to specific sites for improving drug development. This phospholipid complex technique can also be applied for conventional dosage forms and is generally known as a pharmacosome [37]. Because a phytosome possesses some advantages including enhanced absorption, improved stability, and a lower therapeutic dose, it s use has been a noteworthy trend in newer drug delivery system s for bioconstituents and plant extracts [22]. Silybin and phosphatidylcholine (PC) could form a 1:2 molecular complex - Siliphos \u00ae, and the phytosme form 4.6- times more non- phytosomal 18 silymarin in healthy subjects [31] . Another study conducted in rats by Morazzoni et al. found that the bioavailability of silybin phytosome was 10- times greater than that of silybin alone, probably due to the effect of PC facilitating silybin movement across the GI mucosa [38]. Moreover, after oral administration of sily bin phytosome in cholecystectomy patients, the mean area under the curve (AUC) for silybin phytosome was over 4- fold greater for non- phytosomal silybin [39] . Yan-yu et al. a PK study in rats to compare the PK characteristics and oral bioavailability of were C max 126.72 and 104.29 T max 0-inf 235.81 ng/mL/h, respectively. -phospholipid complex, the oral bioavailability of phytosomal silybin in rats was much better than that of silybin- N-methylglucamine because of the improvement of the lipophilicity of silybin phytosome. These results indicate that silybin combined with phospholipids may augment the oral bioavailability of silybin and improve its delivery into the liver. Softgel Technology Savio et al. performed a randomized, single- dose, cross -over study on silybin bioavailability in a hard shell capsule and a sof tgel capsule in which silybin was mixed in ratio with phosphatidylcholine [32] After subjec ts consumed a softgel capsule, the PK analysis showed that the mean values of C max and AUC last increased more than two- fold in comparison to a hard shell capsule. The outcomes demonstrated that the soft gelatin capsule could improve the bioavailability of silybin, probably because an oily medium formulated softgel capsule worked as a physiological carrier to help silybin cross the intestinal wall. 19 Nanoparticles Micronization and nanonization are two approaches to increase drug bioavailability by increasing surface area. Particle size could be reduced to 2- 5 \u00b5m in micronization; whereas, nanonization is the process of minimizing the particle size to 10-1000 nm [16, 41] . Using nanonization, poorly soluble compounds could be made into nanoparticles for increasing the dissolution rate and solubility. Due to the bioavailability - improving ability of nanoparticles, they have been applied in the treatment of different diseases. Zhang et al. prepared silibinin -solid lipid nano particles (SLNs) by using stearic acid (biodegradable lipid) and Brij -78 (surfactant) for slow release of silibinin . The in vitro release results indicated that there was almost no drug release from their SLNs in three days and that the SLNs with stearic acid and Brij -78 may possess extended- release ability to avoid drug loss on delivering silibinin to the target ed liver cell [42] . Jun et al. studied the influence of SLNs on the oral bioavailability of silymarin (based on silybin ) in rats. Using three different particle sizes (150, 500, and 1000 nm) to evaluate the impact of particle size on oral absorption, they found that the oral bioavailability of the smallest SLNs (150 nm) was significantly higher than the other SLNs. The AUC of 150 nm SLNs was 2.1- and 2.5- times larger than that of 500 and 1000 nm SLNs, respectively [43] . They also investigated the biodis tribution of two kinds of SLNs prepared by a hot and cold homogenization method. Based on the outcomes from in vitro release experiments, they chose SLNs produced by cold homogenization (cold -SLNs) for further biodistribution studies in mice. Compared with the milled silymarin powder suspension, the relative bioavailability of cold- SLNs was 2.8 -fold higher. Apart from the kidneys, the exposure of cold- SLNs was higher in other organs 20 than that of the suspension. These results showed that silymarin prepared as SLNs can enhance the oral bioavailability of silymarin (based on silybin) and might be a promising drug delivery system for silymarin [44] . Nanosuspensions Nanotechnology, such as nanosuspensions, has been to increase the solubility of poorly soluble phytochemicals. Nanosuspensions are defined as sub- micron colloidal dispersion systems which consist of pur e drug particles and surfactants or stabilizers with a mean particle size between 10 and 1000 nm [45, 46] . Compared with 100% drug loading [47]. Nanosuspensions demonstrate several benefits, including dissolution velocity improvement, particle size reduction, and various administration routes [48] . Since poor solubility and low oral bioavailability are the main obstacles with the application of silybin, nanosuspensions have been used to address these problems in a few studies. Zheng et al. evaluated the in vitro antitumor effect of a silybin nanosuspension on human prostatic carcinoma PC -3 cell line compared with silybin solution formulation [49]. Though silybin nanosuspension did not change the mechanism of silybin- induced apoptosis, findings from this study indicated that silybin nanosuspension exerted higher inhibition rates to PC -3 cells in comparison to silybin solution at the same concentration. This phenomenon may be attributed to the silybin nanosuspension adhering to the mucus layer to prolong biological activit y and facilitating silybin transfer across the epithelial cells. Wang et al. performed in vitro and in vivo studies on the influence of silybin nanosuspensions [50, 51] . They found that nanosuspensions had a significant impact on drug transport across the Caco- 2 cell monolayer and the enhanced permeability was 21 due to the increased dissolution rate. After oral administration of silybin nanosuspensions in beagles, the in vivo results showed that the silybin suspensions significantly improved silybin's bioavailability in comparison to the powdered formulations. Furthermore, they investigated the influence of particle size (637 \u00b1 9.4 nm vs. 132 \u00b1 4.8 nm) on the in vivo distribution and hepatoprotection. After intravenous administration, the larger particle size was favorably targeted at liver and spleen. After intravenous or oral administration, the silybin nanosuspensions demonstrated significant hepatoprotective effects by lowering the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and total bilirubin. When compared to the carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) treated c ontrol group, hepatoprotective effects of the two silybin nanosuspensions were confirmed by histopathological examination. These outcomes suggested that the silybin nanosuspension could be used to improve the therapeutic efficacy and drug target delivery of the silybin, and that silybin nanosuspensions with smaller particle size exhibited a higher potential to increase oral bioavailability of silybin. Nanoemulsions An emulsion is a dispersion system constructed of oil phase, water phase, and surfactants ; the droplet size of the emulsion affects its target distribution [52] . Generally, a nanoemulsion represents a droplet size from 10 to 100 nm [53] . Due to low oral bioavailability of silymarin on silybin) , incorporation of silymarin (based on silybin) into a nanoemulsion formulation administered orally was employed to enhance its solubility, oral bioavailability and therapeutic effects. A nanoemulsion could be regarded as a sustained release formulation because the bioactive compound is wrapped in the inner phase and avoids direct contact with the body [54] . Incorporati on 22 of herbal medicines into a nanoemulsion will not only sustain the effect of drugs and increase the stability of herbal constituents, it may also enhance the penetrability of drugs to the skin or mucous membranes for topical administration. Parveen et al. evaluated the hepatoprotection of the nanoemulsion formulation silymarin against [55] . Through biochemical parameters and histopathological properties, such as ALT, AST and liver histopathology, hepatoprotective activity was assessed in Wistar rats. As compared to standard silymarin, the nanoemulsion- treated rats demonstrated significant increase in total albumin, globulin, and glutathione in tissues and decreased pyruvate transaminase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and tissue lipid peroxides. The findings indicated that a nanoemulsion formulation of silymarin- treated rats reversed liver toxicity induced by CCl 4 more effectively as compared to standard silymarin- treated rats. Though a nanoemulsion formulation of silymarin appeared to be a promising way to improve the effectiveness of silymarin in hepatoprotection, the PK properties of silybin within the nanoemulsion formulation were not addressed in the study. Liposomes Liposomes are self -assembled, spherical particles featuring a lipid characterized by ies [56]. Since polar lipids construct liposomal bilayers, hydrophilic drugs are aggregated in the water section and lipophilic compounds are entrapped in the lipid section. Therefore, hydrophilic or lipophilic compounds can be encapsulated into liposomes without changing their chem ical structures. Given the unique characters, liposomes are able to boost the bioactivities of drugs by augmenting compound solubility, enhancing bioavailability, and increasing intracellular uptake [57, . As a drug delivery system, liposomes are physiologically 23 inert because of the natural phospholipid composition and able to enhance the therapeutic index and safety of incorporated drugs by maintaining drug concentrations for a long period and by carrying them t o the target site. Maheshwari et al. used the ethanol injection method to make liposomal vesicles of silibinin [59]. The liposomal systems were investigated for hepatoprotective activity in mice against CCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity. The results of the in vivo studies showed 55.6% hepatoprotection by silibinin content , plain liposomes can demonstrate hepatoprotective effects. Yan-yu et al. compared the oral bioavailability and PK parameters silymarin proliposome with silybin within silymarin proliposome silymarin were C max 472.62 and T 0-inf 2606.21 and 697 ng/mL/h, respectively. Based on the results, this research demonstrated that silymarin proliposome improved the oral bioavailability of silybin and increased GI absorption of silybin in comparison to plain silymarin. 24 Table 1- 1.

Structures of silybin A and silybin B 27 CHAPTER 2 HYPOTH ESIS Existing Problem in Herbal Supplements Though herbal supplement use has been an emerging trend over the last several decades, there are few studies conducted in multi -herb supplements at this time [61, 62]. Soare et al. performed a randomized, single- blind controlled trial to evaluate the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of consumption of 10 di etary supplements each day over 6 months. The clinical study showed that endothelial function, blood pressure, insulin and inflammatory cytokines in healthy subjects are not influenced after a 6- month use of these supplements. The l ow oral bioavailability of phytochemicals contained in these dietary supplements might be a likely explanation for the lack of therapeutic effects. Since many bioactive phytochemicals demonstrate relatively low oral bioavailability, numerous biopharmaceutical approaches, including complexation with phospholipids and nanotechnology -based drug delivery systems , have been employed to enhance the bioavailability of bioactive phytochemicals contained in dietary supplements. Research Hypothesis Owing to low oral bioavailability of many bioactive phytochemicals, softgel formulations are considered promising dosage forms to enhance bioavailability of poorly soluble phytochemicals. A softgel formulation, IsaGenesis , and a standard dry - powdered formulation, Product B , have been chosen for the present study. We hypothesized that the softgel formulation, IsaGenesis , can augment the bioavailability of the selected bioactive constituents, silybin A and silybin B. 28 Objective Since milk thistle extract is the most predominant ingredient in these two formulations chosen for study, and since silybin A and silybin B are the most abundant flavonolignans of milk thistle extract, the two silybin diastereomers have been chosen as surrogate PK biomarkers for elucidating differences in bioavailability with the respective formulations. The purpose of this study is to test our hypothesis by evaluating the relative bioavailability of silybin A and silybin B with the respective formulations in healthy study participants . Methods and Materials Supplements and Chemi cals Two milk thistle -containing oral dosage forms, Product B (Lot #041403615) and IsaGenesis (Lot #025400816), were provided by the study sponsor (Isagenix International, LLC). Product B containing 125 mg milk thistle extract/capsule (80% silymarin) was m anufactured by Arizona Nutritional Supplements (Chandler, AZ), whereas IsaGenesis containing 160 mg milk thistle extract/softgel capsule (55% silymarin) was manufactured at Best Formulations (City of Industry, CA). Compared with the powder -filled Product B , a notable pharmaceutical difference in IsaGenesis is the incorporation of flaxseed oil and phosphatidylcholine to enhance the absorption and bioavailability of phytochemicals. Authentic analytical reference standards of silybin A and silybin B were purchased from Phytolab GmbH & Co. (Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany). Naringenin, the analytical internal standard (IS), was obtained from SAFC Supply Solutions (St. Louis, MO). Liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC -MS) grade ammonium and methyl tert -butyl ether (MTBE) were all purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Preparation of S tock Solutions, Calibrator Standards, and Q uality Control Samples Stock solutions of silybin A, silybin B and the IS naringenin were prepared i n methanol at concentrations of 1 mg/mL and were used to prepare calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples. All stock and working solutions were stored at - 20\u00b0C until use. Calibrator solutions were prepared by adding the desired amount of work ing solutions to 180 \u00b5L of blank human plasma. The calibrator concentrations were 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 80, and 100 ng/mL plasma for silybin A and silybin B. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was considered to be the lowest calibration standard concentrat ion. QC samples were similarly prepared at concentrations of 1 (LLOQ), 3, 15, and 75 ng/mL. All calibration standards and QCs were stored at - 20\u00b0C until use. Calibration standards over the concentration range of 1- 100 ng/mL were analyzed in duplicate for t hree runs. The standards were considered acceptable if both the precision, expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV), and the accuracy, present ed as the percent relative error (RE), were within \u00b1 15%. The LLOQ was acceptable if the CV and RE were within \u00b1 20%. Study Participants Twelve healthy participants (6 male and 6 female) were recruited in the study. Each participant granted written IRB-approved informed consent and underwent a health assessment. The inclusion criteria were healthy nonsmokers wit hin the age interval of 18 and 50 years, as well as body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 28 kg/m 2. All participants were required to have no clinically significant diseases or history 30 of a medical condition. To avoid pregnancy during the entire protocol, female subjects were required to have negative urine pregnancy test before enrollment and during study participation. No prescription or over -the-counter medications, and no botanical, nutritional supplements (vitamins and energy drinks) were allowed duri ng study participation. Supplement Administration Two study visits were scheduled and conducted at the UF Clinical Research Center (CRC). The washout period was at least 7 days between the two visits (Figure 2-1). Based on the randomization sequence, parti cipants were administrated two capsules of Product B or two capsules of IsaGenesis with 240 mL water at room temperature. Depending on product labeling, two capsules represent a recommended serving of the two respective formulations. After administration of each formulation, participants remained fasting for an additional 4 hours to minimize any food effect on absorption. On both study visits, subjects were provided the same meal to minimize any potential food influence on these multi -herb supplements. Samp le Collection and Processing Blood samples were collected via indwelling venous catheters and a total of nine blood samples wer e obtained over an 8- hour period. Blood collection occurred immediately prior to formulation administration (0 h) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hrs. All samples were drawn in heparinized tubes (BD Vacutainer) and stored on ice until centrifugation at 4\u00b0C. Because the stability of phytoconstituents varies within biological matrices, the samples were not kept on ice for longer than 15 minutes before centrifugation. Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation of blood samples. The resulting plasma was acidified with 10 \u00b5L of 1M acetic acid/mL plasma as a 31 preservative, transferred to labeled storage tubes , and frozen immediately at -70\u00b0C until LC-MS/MS analysis. Analytical Methods Analysis of Silybin A and Silybin B from Oral Dosage Forms A comparison of silybin A and silybin B content of the two respective formulations was performed before the PK study. The content of two capsules (1 serving) of each formulation was weighed, placed into a 10 m L volumetric flask, and dissolved in pure analytical grade methanol. A 1 m L aliquot of the resulting solution was removed and further diluted to an appropriate concentration suitable for LC -MS/MS analysis. Analysis of Silybin A and Silybin B from Human Plasma A high -performance liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric assay was utilized in our laboratory for simultaneously analyzing the free (nonconjugated) flavonolignans: silybin A and silybin B. This method was mainly based on our previously published method for simultaneously detecting flavonolignans in human plasma [29, 63]. In short, 200 \u00b5L of plasma, 100 ng/m L naringenin and 2 m L of MTBE we re added. The samples were shaken at 200 cycles/min for 10 min and then centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at room temperature. The organic phase was then transferred to clean glass tubes. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40\u00b0C, and the remaining residue was reconstituted with 100 \u00b5L of mobile phase, 20 \u00b5L of which were injected for analysis. The LC -MS/MS system consisted of a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and an Applied Biosystems -Sciex API 3000 quadrupole mass spectrometer (Foster City, CA, USA). The analytical column was Phenomenex Luna 5\u00b5 32 C18 column (100A 250 mm x 2 mm, 5 m, Torrance, CA) and C 18 guard column (4 mm x 20 mm, SecurityGuard, Torrance, CA). The mobile phase was 50% methanol and 50% water containing 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium acetate and delivered at a flow rate of 0.25 m L/min. The MS was operated in negative ion mode using turbo electrospray ionization. In the multiple reaction monitoring mode, the following transitions were monitored: M/Z: 481.2125.0 for silybin A and silybin B, and M/Z: 271.1151.0 for naringenin (internal standard) in this method. Measurement of individual silymarin constituents (i.e. , silybin A and silybin B) was achieved by using the following parameters: curtain gas, 8 psi; nebulizer gas (gas 1), 12 psi; CAD gas, 6 psi; TurboIonSpray (IS) voltage, - 4500 V; entrance potential, - 10 V; collision cell exit potential, -6 V; declustering potential, - 80 V; collision energy, m/z: 481.2>125 and 26 eV for m/z: 271.1>151.0; source temperature, 400 \u00b0C; and dwell time, 200 ms. Data was analyzed by AB Sciex Analyst software, version 1.4.2 (AB Sciex, Toronto, Canada). Representative ion chromatograms of IsaGenesis and Product B from the study sponsor (Isagenix International, LLC) and one well -known milk thistle extract Legalon \u00ae (Madaus, GH) are shown in Figure 2- 2. Pharmacokinetic Analy sis Plasma concentrations of silybin A and silybin B were determined in 12 healthy participants completing the entire protocol of a single dose, randomized crossover clinical trial. The PK parameter s for silybin A and silybin B were estimated by a non- compartmental analysis using WinNonlin 6.1 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). The maximum plasma concentration (C max) and time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) were obtained directly from the plasma concentration- time data. According to the linear trapezoidal rule, the area under the plasma concentration- time curve from time 0 33 to infinity (AUC inf) and AUC from time 0 to the last detectable concentration (AUC last) were estimated. The terminal elimination rate constant ( z) was calculated by linear least -squar es regression of the terminal portion of the plasma concentration time curve, and the elimination half -life (t 1/2) was then estimated using the formula t 1/2 = 0.693/ z. Regarding relative bioavailability, the following calculation: relative bioavailabilit y (F) = (AUC /Dose) IsaGenesis / (AUC last /Dose) Product B *100%, was used to estimate relative bioavailability between these two formulations. Statistical Analysis For this crossover trial, G*Power software 3.1 was used for a sample size calculation [64]. Based a two- tailed paired t -test with alpha level of 0.05, in order to detect an effect size of 1 with 80% power, a total sample size of 10 is needed. Therefore, our sample size (twelve particpants) would provide enough power to identify effect sizes that are smaller than one in PK parameter differences between Product B and IsaGenesis. Results are presented as median and interquartile range for T max and mean \u00b1 SD for other PK parameters. To evaluate potential differences in peak and systemic exposure of silybin diastereomers, paired sample t -test is applied to assess the log- transformed C max and AUC last of silybin A and silybin B after oral administration of either Product B or IsaGenesis. S tatistical analysis was performed by SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC) and a P-value 0.05 is considered statistically significant. 34 Figure 2-1.

The range of concentrations was selecte d based on anticipated concentrations of analytes in human plasma within the two study visits. The correlation coefficients (r2) from three independent experiments were 0.99 for silybin A and silybin B. Precision and Accuracy The intra- and inter -run precision (CV, %) and accuracy (RE, %) assessed for silybin A and silybin B are shown in Table 3- 1. The estimated precision and accuracy met the acceptance criteria for silybin A and silybin B. Formulation Analysis The results of Product B and IsaGenesis caps ule analysis are shown in Table 3- 2. These values were used to correct overall silybin exposure to the research participants. In Table 3 -2, both formulations contain roughly equivalent amounts of silybin A and silybin B. Study Participants Twelve healthy s ubjects (six males and six females) completed the entire protocol, and the mean age and weight of these participants is 24.1 \u00b1 3.7 years and 67.9 \u00b1 11.6 kg (mean \u00b1 SD), respectively. All participants tolerated the two formulations well; n one of them experi enced any unanticipated adverse events during the entire clinical trial. 37 Pharmacokinetic Analysis After a single oral dose of either Product B or IsaGenesis, the PK results showed that the two surrogate markers, silybin A and silybin B, were rapidly absorbed and eliminated. The corresponding PK parameter estimate s of silybin A and silybin B evaluated in this study are presented in Table 3- 3. Figures 3- 1 and 3- 2 depict mean plasma concentrations versus time profiles after oral administration of silybin A and silybin B, respectively; mean plasma concentrations versus time profiles of silybin (silybin A and silybin B) are presented in Figure 3- 3. Because the total amounts of silybin A and silybin B are unequal in Product B and IsaGenesis, a dose correction was made by multiplying by a factor of 0.88 (176/200 based on different silymarin exposure per serving) to compare directly data with IsaGenesis to the powdered formulation- Product B (Table 1- 2). This adjustment was made assuming the absorption and disposition of silybin A and silybin B are linear. To provide further comparison between the two respective formulations, the mean plasma concentrations versus time profiles after dose adjustment of IsaGenesis are presented in Figures 3- 1 to 3- 3. Over the 8 -hour blood -sampling period, the silybin A and silybin B PK profiles differed markedly between IsaGenesis and Product B, as depicted in Figures 3- 1 and 3- 2. The IsaGenesis softgel formulation displayed a more rapid rise in plasma concentration and achieved higher peak concentrations (C max) of silybin A and silybin B over the first 6- hour period in comparison with Product B. Furthermore, IsaGenesis manifested an earlier median time to maximum plasma concentration (T max). For silybin A and silybin B, the T max values pr esented in Table 3- 3 were 2 h for the IsaGenesis softgel formulation versus 3 h for the Product B formulation. Although the content of 38 silybin is similar, the softgel formulation resulted in a 365% and 450% larger C max, for silybin A and silybin B, respect ively, when compared with the Product B formulation. Additionally, the dose- normaliz ed Cmax for silybin respectively for IsaGenes is versus Product B. The values of relative bioavailability (F) shown in Table 3- 3 demonstrate that absorption was higher with IsaGenesis compared with Product B by 284% for silybin A and 334% for silybin B. Regarding inter -individual differences and variability in concentration- time curves, Figures 3- 4 through 3- 7 are box plots exemplifying the discrepancy in these two formulations in connection with dose- normalized AUC last and C max of both silybin isomers. The minimum, first quartile, median, third quarti le, and maximum values of AUC last per dose and C max per dose are shown in these box plots. Regarding intra- individual differences, our study design did not permit an evaluation because each volunteer received each formulation only once. Notably, participants who demonstrated lower overall absorption and lower concentrations of silybin A and silybin B did so with the two respective formulations indicating some physiologic differences in gastrointestinal tract rather than formulation issues [65, 66] . In view of reported gender differences i n silybin A and silybin B pharmacokinetics , we found no statistically significant difference in C max and AUC last of silybin A and silybin B between male and female participants in th is study ( P > 0.05; Table 3- 4). However, gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of silybin A and silybin B cannot be determined or excluded given the limited sample size and large inter - individual variability in the present study. 39 Table 3- 1.

This information is important to discover whether promising in vitro findings are likely to be achieved in vivo based on relative exposure. In other words, the putati ve bioconstituents must be sufficiently penetrated or delivered to their target site of biological activity. To date, a comprehensive evaluation of biodisposition is lacking for most dietary supplements and relatively little clinical PK research has been c onducted. In view of the fact that significant PK differences among many milk thistle- containing supplements have been reported, it is essential to perform a comparative PK study before marketing. Additionally, the bioavailability of most oral formulations is usually considered low and highly inconsistent [29] . Major reasons for the poor bioavailability of silymarin constituents include low aqueous solubility, extensive pre- systemic metabolism, and poor permeability across intestinal cells. In order to compare the pharmacokinetics of two multi -herb dietary supplement formulations, a single- dose crossover PK study was completed. Based on the randomization sequence, participants were administered either two capsules of Product B or two softgel capsules of IsaGenesis on alternate clinic visits. In the present study, two flavonolignans of silymarin, silybin A and silybin B, served as surrogate PK biomarkers for characterizing the absorption and relative bioavailability of these two formulations. As with previous clinical PK studies on silybin, the peak concentration (C max) and systemic exposure (AUC inf) were significantly higher for silybin A compared 51 with silybin B [27, 29] . The observed variability results from the known stereoselective metabolism of silybin isomers with faster metabolism of silybin B [67] . The PK evaluation suggested that on average, silybin A and silybin B were rapidly absorbed and eliminated with the two respective formulations. The absorption of silybin A and silybin B was greater with IsaGenesis compared with Product B. Indeed, after dose normalization of silybin A and silybin B, the IsaGenesis formulation exhibited 365% and 450% higher mean C max values, respectively, compared with the Product B formulation. Moreover, the C max values of IsaGenesis for silybin A fitted the range of values from our previous investigation on a well characterized silymarin formulation [29] . Regarding Tmax, both silybin A and silybin B achieved the C max at least 1 hour earlier with IsaGenesis compared with Product B (Table 3- 3). The estimated t 1/2 of silybin A and silybin B appeared to differ between the two formulations; both silybin A and silybin B have a shorter t 1/2 with the IsaGenesis formulation compared with the Product B formulation (Table 3- 3), the reasons for which are unclear . Although the systemic concentrations of silybin A and silybin B a chieved after oral administration are relatively low compared to the in vitro concentrations typically used to assess biological activities, there remains the possibility that these silybins may exhibit their bioactivities at relatively low systemic concentrations. Additionally, inter -subject PK differences were observed with both formulations. In view of box plots in Figures 3- 4 to 3- 7, there seems to be a greater amount of inter - individual variability in the silybins with the IsaGenesis formulation. There are a few limitations to the current study. First, the respective milk thistle- containing supplements were not single herbal extract formulations because they 52 included multiple herbal constituents from different plant sources. Secondly, there is no potent ial effect of concomitant drugs on the results because of exclusion criteria for participants. Thirdly, the two dosage forms did not contain the same amounts of silymarin content (silybin A and silybin B) as well as other botanical extracts. But, the uneven amounts of silybin A and silybin B administered in IsaGenesis and Product B were normalized by dose for PK comparisons. Regarding the pharmacokinetics of the silybins administered as part of a multi - herb supplement in humans, there is scant research at this time and the possible influence of other included bioconstituents on the disposition of silybin A and silybin B is still an open question. The potential of synergistic or competitive effects on absorption and metabolism among various bioconstituents administered as part of multi -herb formulation versus the administration of a single extract or extract component from a natural product has been documented [61, 68, 69] . Concerning silybin A and silybin B systemic exposure, the IsaGenesis formulation obviously improved the absorption of the two silybin isomers, however, it must be emphasized that these findings cannot simply be projected to other constituents incorporated into these multi -herb supplements without di rectly assaying plasma for representative bioactive constituents. In the present study, flaxseed oil and phosphatidylcholine were excipients of IsaGenesis but not Product B. As an n- 3 fatty acid source, flaxseed oil was a potential diluent for the fat -soluble bioconstituents but was not included with the particular intention to improve bioavailability. With respect to the phosphatidylcholine content, the IsaGenesis softgel formulation was not the same as a silybin- phosphatidylcholine complex for some primar y silymarin formulations used in previous studies [70] . 53 However, recognizing the plenitude of phosphatidylcholine in cellular membranes and the established role of phospholipids as excipients for different pharmaceutical applications including as emulsifiers and solubilizers, its inclusion through a micro- coating manufacturing process may enhance the absorption of li pophilic bioconstituents [30]. Although IsaGenesis appeared to provide greater overall exposure to silybin A and silybin B, whether this resulted from phosphatidylcholine inclusion remains speculative at this time and requires further study. Comprehensivel y, the IsaGenesis softgel formulation showed greater overall systemic exposure to silybin A and silybin B compared with the Product B formulation. Further study is needed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of other phytoconstituents (e.g., withaferin A, withanolide A, bacopaside I, and icariin) in IsaGenesis and to investigate the potential herb- drug interactions of taking a multi -herb supplement in healthy subjects. 54 LIST OF REFERENCES [1] A.L.
