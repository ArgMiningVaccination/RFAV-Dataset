Frankincense has been used for 1000's of years to keep temples pure and It has been burned for more than 2000 years, mainly used during times of worship, to help us feel closer to our faith (and therefore our inner strength). Obtaining Frankincense Essential Oil Frankincense essential oil comes from the Boswellia Carterii tree, which is native to Somalia and regions of Pakistan. It is characterised by its thin, peeling bark, tangled branches and clustered leaves. This small and elegant ancient tree is carefully 'bled' (The resin is collected from small cuts made in the bark of the tree and then steam distilled to produce frankincense essential oil) to produce high quantities of resin which is then treated and processed to obtain the woody and aromatic Frankincense oil. This is a small and elegant tree indigenous to the Middle East and highly prized in Israel for its resin, which is burned in religious ceremonies. Frankincense Essential Oil Spiritual History First written about in Biblical times, Frankincense essential oil was the element that was gifted to Christ when he was born. In the Old Testament, Frankincense is mentioned often, being burned during religious ceremonies. The idea was (and still is) that the sweet smoke gathers the prayers of the people and takes them up to heaven in a sweet-smelling cloud to make them more acceptable to God! Frankincense essential oil has such calming and historically spiritual properties that it is often used in meditation to aid people in their practice. Whether in culture or religion, Frankincense oil is considered to provide the most powerful communication link between humans and gods. In Egyptian royalty, Frankincense oil was so precious, that in 1500 BC, Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt organised an expedition to the country of Punt (now Somalia) to research it. Interestingly, the word 'Frankincense' originated from the old French translation of 'franc encens', which means 'quality incense'. Just one Boswellia tree can produce a few pounds of resin each year, and can keep producing resin for hundreds of years. Frankincense Essential Oil Properties for the Skin With powerful anti-inflammatory properties, Frankincense essential oil is an effective natural remedy to calm the complexion. For irritated or damaged skin, the oil restores the epidermis and calms affected areas. For sunburn, rosacea or breakouts, this healing element soothes and nourishes the skin.

The oil can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles by toning and lifting the epidermis and leaving the skin looking fresh.
