One of these is the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP), which deals with two fo- cal issues . The first focus is the effects on increased UV radiation on human health, ani- mals, plants, biogeochemistry, air quali ty, and materials . The second focus is on inter- actions between UV radiation and global climate change and how these may affect hu- mans and the environment . When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes re- sulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously believed . As a result of this, human health and environmental issues will be longer -lasting and more regionally variable. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces a detailed report every four years; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 20 15 (Photochem . Photobiol . Sci., 2015, 14, 1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter Progress Report s of the relevant scientific findings . The most rec ent of these was for 2015 ( Photochem. Photobiol. Sci ., 201 6, 15, 141-147). The present Progress Report for 2016 assesses some of the highlights and new insights with regard to the interactive na- ture of the direct and indirect effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and cli- mate change . The report is detailed Quadrennial Assessment will be made availa- ble in 20 18. ____ _______________________________ _____________________________ ___ \u00a7 List of contributing authors in alphabetical order: Anthony Andrady, Pieter J .

Page 5 of 72 Dedication This Progress Report is dedicated to the memory of Prof essor Jan van der Leun, founding co -chair in 1987 , and member of the UNEP Environ- mental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) , and contributor to the section on human health. In 1971 , through attending a dedicated meeting of the National Academy of Sciences , Jan became involved in assessing the im- pact of a looming threat of a thinning ozone layer. He quantified the effect on skin cancer, became a renowned expert on the subject and conducted important research on the dose -effect in UV carcinogenesis to improve his assessments. We will remember Jan for his untiring dedication also to other health impacts as well as well as int eractions with climate change and in communicating the broad scientific basis for protect ing the strato- spheric ozone layer. For the EEAP, his enduring legacy lies in the remark- able contribution he made in communicating the importance to policymak- ers, scientists, and the public of phasing out the substances that were de- pleting the ozone layer and consequently leading to increasing UV radia- tion. H e indeed had a particular talent for emphasising and linking the sci- entific and political implications of protecting the ozone layer. He has left lasting and warm memories of his presence and leadership; we will keep these memories of a collegial diplomat and personal frie nd as we carry on his good work . Jan Cornelis van der Leun, June 14, 1928 -July 6 2016 He was a man among st men, we shall not see his like again.

However, variability due to natural causes, such as vol- canic eruptions, precludes similar conclusions for later months when the UV radiation is higher and of greater biological relevance . Ozone de- pleting substances have been controlled by the Montreal Pr otocol. Therefore increases in Antarctic ozone318 and decreases in UV radiation are expected in response to this historic agreement. Volcanic eruptions episodically interfere with recovery. For example, in 2015, close to record high levels of UV radia- tion were observed at the South Pole later in the spri ng (Fig. 1), which were partly caused by en- hanced ozone losses due to the eruption of the Calbuco volcano in Chile. 1.2 As concentrations of ozone depleting sub- stances (ODS) de- crease over the next decades, greenhouse gases (GHGs) will be- come the dominant drive r of changes in stratospheric ozone . UV radiation will de- crease in the middle and high latitudes rela- tive to the historical pe- riod 1955 -1975 but the direction of change in the tropics depends on the emission scenario. Model simulations have quantified chan ges of ozone and UV radiation for the period of 2075 -2095 relative to the historical period of 1955 -1975 under differ- ent emissions scenarios56. This study suggests that stratospheric ozone will increase substantially above its pre ozone 'hole' levels (also known as \"super recovery\") at all latitudes, if emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) aRepresentative are greenhous e gas concentration (not emissions) trajecto- ries adopted by the IPCC for its fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. The pathways are used for climate modeling and research. They describe four possible climate futures, all of which are consid- ered possible d epending on how much greenhouse gases are emitted for the years to come. The four RCPs, RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5, are named after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre -industrial values (+2.6, +4.5, +6.0, and +8.5 W m-2, respec- tively). Fig. 1. Daily maximum UV Index measured at the South Pole in 2015 (red line) compared with the average (white line) and the lowest and highest values (grey shading) of observations performed between 1990 and 2014. Meas- urements between the second half of October 2015 to mid - December 2015 were close to the upper limit of historical observations. These large values can be attributed to the deep ozone 'hole ' of 2015, which was well centered over the South Pole. The figure is adapted from378 and updated with data from November and December 2015. Page 7 of 72 RCP8.5.162) Consequently, the UV Index (UVI) would decrease substantially at all latitudes. The decreases of UVI at Northern mid -latitudes would range between ca 5 and ca 15%, with the largest decreases expected in the winter months, thus further limiting UV radiation available for production of vitamin D during winter (see section 2) . Decreases at Southern mid -latitudes are some- what smaller. In the tropics, the decreases would be smallest and range be- tween 0 and 7%. These projections are greatly dependent on the emission scenario. For example, if actual emissions of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O co uld be ag- gressively reduced to the RCP2.6 scenario, UV I would increase by up to 5% at all latitudes, except in the spring at high latitudes. In the Arctic spring, de- creases of up to 5% are predicted, while in the Antarctic spring the remaining halocarbons continue to deplete polar ozone and increase surface UV expo- sure by up to 20%. Note that these projections only considered changes in ozone and did not take into account changes in clouds, aerosols or surface al- bedo. According to Bais et al.22, changes in UV radiation due to these factors are expected to be of similar magnitude to those related to changes in ozone. In another study,229 simulations with a chemistry -climate model forced by three different emissions scenarios (RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) suggest that total ozone columns in the tropics will be lower by the end of the 21st century compared to the 1960s in all scenarios with the largest decrease in the RCP6.0 scenario. For the RCP6.0 scenario the concomitant increase in DNA -weighted UV irrad iance reaches 15% in specific tropical regions (e.g. , in South America, south ern Asia and over large parts of the Pacific Ocean). 1.3 There is increased confidence that stratospheric ozone depletion is a major driver of climate change in the Southern Hemispher e. For the first time, a climate model that included interactive chemistry to describe the evo- lution of stratospheric ozone has been used to assess the influences of the depletion of ozone in the Antarctic ozone 'hole' on the Southern Ocean circu- lation and Antarctic sea ice.198 This model predicts stronger cooling of the lower stratosphere and accelerated circumpolar westerly winds in Antarctica during November -January than models with prescribed chemistry that have been used in the past. The stronger trends in surface wind -stress predicted by this model result in larger increases of the Southern Ocean meridional over- turning circulation, leading to year -round stronger ocean warming near the surface and enhanced decreases in Antarctic sea ice, which is consistent with previous studies discussed in a previous assessment344. The results of the model have been verified by comparison with historical observations of sea ice extent over the 1990 -2010 period. Ozone depletion in Antarctica was shown to explain more than h alf of the ob- served long -term changes in austral subtropical precipitation between 1979 and 2013, while increasing GHGs have a weaker role.21 This finding emerged from a statistical modelling approach (maximum covariance analysis) that was used to quantify the relative contribution of different climate forcings, including ozone depletion, changes in the sea surface temperature o f the equatorial Pa- cific, and increasing GHGs. 1.4 Stratospheric ozone depletion and increasing greenhouse gases cause changes in the tropical atmospheric circulation , resulting in a poleward Page 8 of 72 shift of the boundaries of climatic zones. A modelling study has sho wn that the observed poleward expansion of the Hadleyb circulation is caused mainly by anthropogenic forcings, such as increasing GHGs and stratospheric ozone depletion, rather than by natural forcings.332 It was found that the effect of ozone depletion is dominant in the austral spring and summer for the southern cell, but less intense for the northern cell in the boreal spring. The continued expansion of the Hadley cell expected by the unabated increase of GHGs will be slowed down by ozone recovery. This modification of the Hadley cell will modify the boundaries of the climatic zones, leading to expansion of subtropi- cal dry zones to higher latitudes, an d affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (see sections 3 and 4). 1.5 The Montreal Protocol has been beneficial not only for stratospheric ozone and surface UV radiation, but also in mitigati ng the adverse ef- fects of intensifying tropical cyclones . Most ozone-depleting substances (ODS) controlled by the Montreal Protocol also are greenhouse gases and therefore the decrease in their concentrations in the atmosphere since the late 1990s379 have prevented additional warming of the sea surface, w hich is an important factor in determining the intensity of tropical cyclones. A modeling study267 has shown that, without the Montreal Protocol, the intensity of tropical cyclones would have been three times as large by the year 2065. Cyclone -in- duced damage rises rapidly with increasing cyclone intensity, and global eco- nomic sav ings due to implementation of the Montreal Protocol will likely be in the range of tens to hundreds of billions of US dollars.251 1.6 In the last two decades , changes in solar UV radiation in northern mid- latitudes have been mainly controlled by clouds and aerosols rather than by ozone. A study of a 20 -year record (1994 -2014) o f spectrally re- solved UV irradiance in Thessaloniki, Greece ,113 revealed increases in annual mean UV irradiance of 2 -6% per decade. In the summer, the increases are larger (7 -9% per decade) and are caused mainly by decreasing cloudiness. During the last decade of the record (since the mid -2000s) UV -B and UV -A ir- radiance have been stable, or slightly de creasing due mainly to effects of aer- osols and clouds, which masked the effects of the very small changes in ozone. Ozone effects are mainly manifested in the short -term (year -to-year) variability of UV irradiance. These results are consistent with results for other locations discussed previously.344 1.7 Satellite -derived estimates of UV irradiance offer high spatial coverage and are increasingly used for informing the public (e.g., via mobile phone applications). However, these estimates are often positively or negatively biased compared to ground -based measurements particularly in the presence of clouds, high concentrations of aerosols, and snow or ice. Estimates of UV irradiance from satellites are derived by combining measurements of reflected radiation with model calculations. Their accuracy is therefore often limited by incomplete information of the model input parame- ters, such as aerosols, clouds and, at some locations, surface reflectivity. Irra- diance estimates are generally less accurate for UV -B than UV -A regions of b The Hadley circulation is a large -scale atmospheric convection cell in which air rises at the equator and sinks at medium latitudes, typically at about 30\u00b0 Northern or S outhern latitudes. Page 9 of 72 the spectrum. For example, the irradiance inferred from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard NASA's Aura satellite exceeded clear -sky ground - based measurements at Thessaloniki, Greece, by up to 14% at 305 nm and up to 10% at 310 nm. I n contrast, at 324 nm and 380 nm, the OMI data under- estimated the UV irradiance by less than 5%.399 These wavelength -dependent biases indicate that the spectral absorption and scattering properties of a ero- sols may not be correctly addressed by the satellite data processor. At the Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP), located in a pristine mountainous re- gion of southeast France, UV data from OMI and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME -2) overesti mate the clear -sky noon -time UV Index (UVI) by 6% and 2%, respectively. At Saint -Denis (SDR), located on La R\u00e9union Is- land in the Indian Ocean, both OMI and GOME -2 observations are biased high by 4% relative to ground -based observations. These small biases gener- ally increase for all -sky conditions and are 9% at OHP and 11% at SDR.51 The results of the above studies are only recent examples; differences between satellite and gro und-based instruments can be smaller or larger at other loca- tions .344 Recent field experiments indicated that when soot, volcanic sand, and glacial silt are deposited on snow surfaces, they sink within minutes into the snow. For reflected radiation measure d by satellite radiometers at nadir viewing di- rections (i.e., vertically below the satellite) the surface appears darker, but for larger viewing angles it appears brighter, almost as for natural snow.263 These discrep ancies in the estimated reflectivity may affect the accuracy of satellite - derived spectral irradiance data over snow -covered regions. Ground -based measurements of UV radiation therefore continue to be valuable. 1.8 Calculations of risk -benefit thresholds from exposure to UV radiation may require revision. Risk-benefit assessments from exposures to UV radia- tion are usually based on the action spectra for erythema (sun -burning) and producti on of vitamin D .227 As has been noted in recent reports,22, 252 the cur- rently -used CIE action spectrum for production of pre-vitamin D 3 in human skin47 may not be correct and may also change as a function of exposure. A recent paper discussing chemical modelling of the com plex reaction pathways involved in skin chemistry predicts an initial action spectrum that is similar to the CIE action spectrum, but is displaced to shorter wavelengths.354 Such a displacement would be more consistent with the observation that little vitamin D is produced at latitudes poleward of 40\u00b0 in winter.369 Further, this work pro- vides evidence that the shape of the vitamin D action spectrum c hanges as a function of exposure to UV radiation and will become negative at wavelengths between 315 and 330 nm after exposures of only a few SEDc. A negative ac- tion spectrum means that vitamin D is destroyed rather than produced after absorption of photon s in this wavelength range. If true, this would have im- portant implications for people who are confined indoors behind glass win- dows, which transmit only UV -A, but not UV -B radiation. The study by van Dijk et al.354 also highlighted large differences i n the absolute amounts of vitamin c SED or Standard Erythemal Dose equals 100 J m-2 of erythemally -weighted UV radiation, which quantifies the effect of UV radiation in the development of sunburn. Page 10 of 72 D derived by the various action spectra for vitamin D that are currently pro- posed in the literature. 2 Ozone, ultraviolet radiation and health: an assessment of the latest research 2.1 Exposure to UV radiation has both risks and benefits for human health. For any individual, there is likely to be an optimal level of exposure, but this is highly variable and difficult to define. There are both direct and indirect effects on health. Direct adverse effects include skin cancers, cataract, and reactiva- tion of so me viral infections. The best defined direct benefit is the synthesis of vitamin D. Indirect effects include those resulting from changes in food quality (see section 3) and disinfection of surface waters used for drinki ng (see sec- tion 4 ). 2.2 Warmer temperatu res in the future will alter how much time people spend outdoors. Greater time spent outdoors may increase exposure to UV radiation and change the balance of risks and benefits for human health. A recent Australian study showed that as the ambient temperat ure in- creased, people living in warmer climates tended to spend less time outdoors, while those living in cooler climates spent more time outdoors.388 Depending on whether effective sun protection is used, increasing time outdoors in- creases exposure to both UV -A and UV -B radiation. Research on the health risks of stratospheric ozone depletion has focused on UV -B radiation as the cause of DNA damage and skin cancers. New research suggests that UV -A irradiation inhibits the repair of DNA d amage through a number of path- ways,55, 175, 238 and fosters local invasion of tumour cells.97, 173 These pro- cesses, togethe r with immune suppression caused by both UV -A and UV -B radiation82, are likely to enhance the development and spread of skin cancers. During the course of the 21st century, predicted changes in ambient UV radia- tion resulting from latitude -dependent variations in stratospheric ozone and climate -induced changes in clouds will alter the balance of risks and benefits for human health. For example, under a global warming future, the relationship between ambient UV radiati on and incidence of skin cancer389 will be modified because of climate -associated changes in sun exposure behaviour. 2.3 The overall incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma and non -mela- noma skin cancer (now called keratinocyte cancer) continues to in- crease in most countries for which data are availab le, but is decreasing in several countries in younger age groups. Skin cancer is the most com- mon cancer in many regions where the population is predominantly fair - skinned. Changes in incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) vary between countries or regions. Incidence has increased in all age groups in Nordic and northern European countries (for example, by over 4% per year in Denmark from 1985 to 2012), with particularly steep increases in the elderly (70+ years).34, 124, 130, 149, 152, 257, 323, 353 In southern European countri es, overall incidence of CMM has also increased,8, 80, 266, 269 but in some regions (for ex- ample, Catalonia) is stable (30 -34 year old 's) or has decreased (20 -29 year olds) in younger age groups.269 This pattern of increasing overall incidence but decreasing incidence in younger age groups (<20 years) is also apparent Page 11 of 72 in the USA and New Zealand.60, 311, 371 In Australia, after taking account of the changing population structure toward an older population (i.e., age -stand ard- ised rates), overall incidence of CMM has decreased by 0.7% per year since 2005.371 Incidence of CMM has also decreased (by 3% per year) in Israel,310 but has increased in Iran.277 In South Africans with fair skin, incidence of CMM is hig h and increasing.211 Keratinocyte mous cell carcinomas (SCC). These arise from the most common cells in the epidermis of the skin, called keratinocytes (Fig. 2). Age -standardised inci- dence rates of KC are continuing to rise around the world.1, 13, 59, 289, 293, 310 In- creases may be greater in women than in men.13, 59, 293 In some locations, such as Canada1 and northern California,13 the rates are stabilising in younger cohorts. Reductions in skin can- cer incidence in younger age groups are probably due to a com- bination of effective sun protection programs and a more indoors life- style. However, the in- fluence of increasing numbers of darker skinned migrants, who are at lower risk, to countries with high skin cancer incidence, can- not be discounted.269 Persistent increas ing in- cidence in older age groups likely reflects high sun exposure in earlier life. It is concern- ing that the new data available for northern Europe show that incidence of CMM and KC in all age groups is continuing to increase. 2.4 Due to its high incidence, skin cancer and particularly keratinocyte can- cer, result in a considerable economic burden. The lifetime cost of the 15,000 new cases of skin cancer diagnosed in New South Wales (NSW), Aus- tralia, in 2010 was estimated to be AUD 536 million (ca USD 400 million at current exchange rates) or AUD 3514 per incident case (ca USD 2 500); direct costs for management of the skin cancer accounted for 72% of this total.91 Alt- hough the cost per CMM was much higher than the cost per KC (AUD 44,279 vs 2459; ca USD 34,000 vs 1,800), KC accounted for 68% of total costs due to its higher incidence. In South Africa the cost per lesion was much lower than in Australia (ca USD 150) but skin cancer still constituted a significant Fig. 2.

The horny layer consists of dead keratinocytes that are shed and replaced from below. Page 12 of 72 economic burden, with an estimated annual cost of USD 15.7 million.125 Costs are also high in countries where skin cancer incidence is lower. In the USA, the average number of adults treated for skin cancer was 4.9 million in 2007 - 2011 (an increase from 3.4 million in 2002 -2006), at an annual total cost of USD 8.1 billion (up from 3.6 billion in 2002 -2006). This 126% increase is much greater than the increase of 25% seen for all other cancers over the same time period.137 Models suggest that investment in skin cancer prevention campaigns, particu- larly in areas where there is an extremely high incidence, have an economic benefit. An analysis of the NSW situation found a cost -to-benefit ratio of 3.85, indicating that for every $1 invested in prevention there would be an economic return of $3.85.92 2.5 Skin cancer is be coming recognised by a range of countries as an occu- pational disease. Implications include a responsibility by workplaces to provide adequate sun protection and the possibility that workers can claim compensation for their skin cancer. In a pooled analysis of data from Brazil and Italy, occupational sun exposure was associated with a marked in- crease in risk of CMM.112 Other studies show a link with KCs but not CMM.339 Outdoor workers are typically exposed to a dose of UV radiation that is 2 -3 times higher than that of indoor workers who spend less time outdoors. There is an associated increase in KCs; for example, in one study, outdoor workers had a 43% higher risk of BCC and a two -fold higher risk of SCC than the gen- eral population.167 In a study in Northern Greece, farmers not only developed more BCC s than workers in other occupations, but these occurred at a younger age and were 6 times more likely to be of an aggressive subtype.9 Several studies have shown increased incidence of CMM in airline pi lots and cabin crew. In a recent meta -analysis of these studies, there was a two -fold increased risk among pilots.300 However, the similar increased risk among cabin crew suggests that this is unlikely to be an effect of UV radiation enter- ing the cockpit, and other ex planations, such as travel to sunny locations, need to be considered. 2.6 Sunscreen provides effective protection against sunburn and may de- crease UV -induced skin cancers. Research shows that sunscreen provides protection from DNA damage and sunburn following exposure to UV radiation (reviewed in309), see Fig. 3. This suggests that sunscreens should protect against skin cancer. Regular use of sunscreen was associated with a lower number of nevi (moles) , a marker of melanoma risk, in children in one study from Catalonia, Spain,234 but a higher prevalence of multiple nevi (>50) was found in adults in a large study from Finland.315 The greater number of nevi in adults is likely due to increased sunburns and sunbathing vacations among sunscreen users, as shown in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study.119 However, among sunscreen users, those who used a sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 15 or higher at least once were less likely to de- velop CMM than those consistently usin g sunscreen with an SPF of <15. The study reported that incidence of CMM could be reduced by 18% with regular use of sunscreen of SPF15 by women aged 40 -75 years.119 Indeed, the only randomised trial test ing sunscreen use for the prevention of skin cancer showed that daily sunscreen use reduced the risk of SCC and melanoma.126, Page 13 of 72 127 On the basis of the results from this study, it was estimated that regular use of sunscreen in Australia could pre vent around 9% of SCC (n=14,190 tu- mours in 2008) and 14% of CMM (n=1730 tumours).256 However, a recent systematic review highlighted some limitations of this trial and observed that there was, as yet, insufficient high quality evidence to conclusively show that use of sunscreen prevented skin cancers.298 2.7 Despite strong public health programs providing guidance about sun protection in many countries and research showing high levels of knowledge and a positive attitude toward sun protection, compliance re- mains low, and risky sun exp osure behaviour and a preference for a tan are common. Teenagers are particularly resistant to messages to protect their skin against the sun. Qualitative research suggests that the desire for a tan outweighs concerns about future risks of photoageing and skin cancer.96 In Hungary, 74% of 12 -19 year old 's had experienced at least one serious sunburn, 5% purposely sunbathed daily, and 10% did no t use any form of sun protection.118 In Ireland, which has the highest incidence of CMM in Europe, nearly 50% of a sample of Cork university students r eported deliberate tan- ning in the previous summer.111 Parents use sun protection measures more commonly for their children than for themselves.235 A systematic review of the evidence showed that a high proportion of people diagnosed with CMM re- ported subsequ ent sunbathing (up to two -thirds at least once since diagnosis), sunburns (60% at least once in a 3 -year period) and indoor tanning (up to a quarter of survivors) and did not practice skin self -examination.240 In children of CMM survivors, 28% had been sunburnt at least once in the previous 6 months.340 Sun exposure in childhood may be particularly important to later life risk of CMM and BCC. Health gains through decreasing incidence of these cancers in younger age group s that are currently being seen in many coun- tries (see section 2.3) are likely to be reversed without continued investment in sun protection programs targeting sun exposure in childhood, adolescence, and high -risk groups. 2.8 Immunosuppression following solid organ or stem cell transplantation greatly increases the risk of all forms of skin cancer, particularly squa- mous cell carcinoma . There was a nearly 8 -fold increase in KC and a two - fold increase in invasive CMM following heart transplantation.308 CMM and lip cancers were more common in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell trans- plantations compared to the general population.286, 348 The location of the skin cancers points to UV radiation as the primary cause, coupled with drug -in- duced post -transplantation immunosuppression121 and effects on repair of DNA damage.191 2.9 UV-induced immune suppression has both positive and negative conse- quences for a range of diseases, including autoimmune disease and re- activation of viruses. Exposu re to UV radiation results in suppression of im- mune responses that may have beneficial effects for disorders such as for au- toimmune disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis) and allergy, but cause harm through allowing the development of skin cancer and reactivat ion of viral in- fections. A recent study from Perth, Western Australia, reported that the num- ber of cases of shingles (caused by reactivation of herpes zoster) notified to the register of infectious diseases increased with increasing ambient levels of Page 14 of 72 UV ra diation.186 This confirms similar findings published previously, from Po- land,398 Korea171 and Taiwan.386 Another human herpes virus, HHV8, is nec- essary, but not sufficient cause of Kaposi sarcoma. In a cohort of American male veterans infected with HIV (prior to the availability of antiretroviral ther- apy) the risk of Kaposi s arcoma was increased in men with a diagnosis of KC (a marker of high exposure to UV radiation) and in those living at locations with high ambient UV radiation.57 The net benefit or harm of UV -induced i m- mune suppression is not yet clear; further studies, particularly around the size of any benefits for autoimmune and allergic diseases, will better define the balance of risks and benefits. 2.10 Exposure of the eye to sunlight has both adverse and beneficial ef fects on the eye. A gradient of increasing incidence of conjunctival melanomas with closer location to the Equator, and the presence of mutations with a UV- signature in these tumours, strongly suggest that UV radiation is a major cause.285 Melanomas of the eye are rare and conjunctival melanoma ac- counts for only 5% of The more co mmon uveal mela- noma that involves structures deeper in the eye is unlikely to be directly UV - induced.140 Cataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. In developed countries , cataract surgery is widely accessible so that cataract -related vision loss is un- common.237 Nevertheless, socio -economic and, to some extent, geographical (e.g., urban vs rural) differences in access to effective surgery can lead to dis- parities in cataract -associated loss of vision.237 Cataract is a major contributor to vision loss in Africa.211 Exposure to UV radiation is a major cause of cata- ract, especially cortical and posterior sub -capsular cataract. In a recent study, there was a much higher prevalence of cataract, particularly cortical cataract, and with a younger age of onset, in a high altitude (higher UV -B radiation), compared to a low altitude, region of China.397 Furthermore, there was a posi- tive correlation between cataract disability -adjusted life years and levels of ambient erythemal (sunburning) UV radiation in China.404 Myopia (short -sightedness) affects over 80% of young adults in many East and Southeast Asian countries. In other countries , there has been a rapid in- crease in the prevalence of the condition, with around half of young adults in the USA and Europe now affected.89 Several studies have found that children who spend more time outdoors have a lower risk of developing myopia. In re- search recently reported, two large trials in China involving primary school children (aged 6 -11 years) showed that interventions over 1 -3 years to in- crease the t ime spent outdoors while at school were associated with a signifi- cant reduction in the incidence of myopia.146, 166 It is not yet clear what ele- ment of \"time outdoors\" provides the protective effect. Several studies show an increased risk of myopia in association with vitamin D deficiency.335, 395 Al- ternatively, exposure to UV radiation or the shorter wavelengths (blue) of visi- ble light (at the much higher level experienced outdoors compared to indoors) may protect against the development of myopia by slowing the axial growth of the eye.278 Childhood exposure may be particularly important for both the Page 15 of 72 risks and be nefits; health messages should encourage children to have regu- lar time outdoors, but also protect the eyes from high levels of UV radiation using hats, shade and sunglasses. 2.11 Exposure to UV radiation may have benefits through both vitamin D and non-vitamin D pathways, but any benefits will need to be balanced against the known risks. The commonly accepted marker of vitamin D sta- tus is the concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in serum or plasma . In 2011, after a comprehensive systematic review of th e literature, the United States Institute of Medicine concluded that a 25(OH)D concentra- tion of 50 nmol/L is sufficient to optimise the bone health of most people. They further concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a causal association between low 25(OH)D concentration and non -bone health outcomes.161 While some groups argue for a higher cut -off for sufficient concentrations of 25(OH)D,153 a recent study showed that a 25(OH)D con centration of ca 30 nmol/L was sufficient to optimise bone mineral density and a range of markers of muscle strength and function in middle -aged women.385 Recent exposure to UV radiation is commonly a major determinant of 25(OH)D concentration,181 although a recent systematic review showed that , in regions with negligible exposure to UV radiation , it is possible for adults to maintain 25(OH)D levels >50nmol/L for several months. The authors specu- lated that this could have been due to preceding exposure to UV radiation and storage of vitamin D and then delayed release during periods of low ambient UV radiation.282 Nevertheless, while the serum or plasma 25(OH)D concentra- tion is a marker of vitamin D status, in many regions it is equally a marker of recent exposure to UV radiation. To separate out a specific causal effect of vitamin D on a health outcome, vitamin D supplementation studies are re- quired. New evidence suggests a possible causal association between high vitamin D status and reduced risk and/or severity of asthma. Low maternal 25(OH)D concentration was associated with an incre ased risk of wheeze in the off- spring105 and, in a meta -analysis, low concentrations of 25(OH)D in early childhood were associated with an increased risk of pe rsistent asthma (com- paring lowest vs highest category reported in each study).154 A meta -analysis found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the rate of asthma exacerba- tions requiring hospitalisation or treatment with systemic corticosteroids.222 These results indicate a specific beneficial effect of vitamin D, but do not pro- vide guidance about the optimal concentration of 25(OH)D to reduce risk or severity of asthma. Exposure to the sun may h ave effects that are not mediated by vitamin D.210 A recent study showed that irradiation with UV -A reduced blood pressure tem- porarily, possibly through release of nitric oxide stores in the skin (reviewed in384). In a study in southern Sweden, adults reporting a habit of intentional sun exposure had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non -can- cer/non -CVD death than those who avoided sun exposure.206 Compared to the highest sun exposure group, life expectanc y in sun -avoiders was reduced by 0.6 -2.1 years; avoidance of sun exposure was a risk factor for death of Page 16 of 72 similar magnitude to smoking in this study.206 Whether this association can be attributed to vitamin D, other UV -induced pathways, or differences in unmeas- ured lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise) between people with high and low sun exposure, cannot be determined. The weight of risk vs benefit for sun exposure depends on the size of the ef- fect and the pr oportion that can be attributed to low/high exposure to UV radi- ation as well as the total burden of UV -related health outcomes. While there is some confidence in the burden of disease that can be attributed to overexpo- sure to UV radiation,256 the range of diseases caused by low sun expo sure and the size of any potential risks are unclear. 2.12 The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies around the world, with some evidence that it is related to latitude. It is difficult to compare the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency between countries or over time due to the historical inaccuracy and imprecision in the measurement of concentrations of 25(OH)D in blood. The development of standardised protocols and rigorous quality assurance schemes are now improving measurement and these have been used in several national health surveys (see Fig. 4 ). The overall preva- lence of vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) across a range of European coun- tries was 40%, with 13% moderately to severely vitamin D -deficient (<30 nmol/L).64 In the United States, standardised concentrations of 25(OH)D from the Na- tional Health and Nutrition Surveys (NHANES) show no change in the mean value from 1998 to 2006 but an increase of 5 nmol/L from 2007 to 2010 which is partly due to vitamin D supplementation. The prevalence of vitamin D defi- ciency (<50 nmol/L) 30% from in 2009 -2010. Less than 7% had moderate to severe vitam in D deficiency.303 In the Australian Na- tional Health Survey, 24% of Australian adults had concentrations of 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L and 7% <30 nmol/L.18 There was some evidence of a latitude gra- dient, although this is likely to be somewhat masked by more vitamin D sup- plementation in states with lower ambient UV radiation (10% in the most southern state compared with 2% in the most northerly state).18 Studies from other areas have not used standardised measurements and thus need to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, t here is evidence of wide- spread deficiency in many parts of the world .260 Dark -skinned migrants to de- veloped countries commonly have a high prevalence of vitamin D defi- ciency.18, 220 Page 17 of 72 Figure 1. Distribution map of the proportion of population who have A), vitamin D defi- ciency (<50 nmol/L) and B), severe vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/L), with restriction to population -based samples and a vitamin D assay that is standardised to the Vitamin D Standardisation Program. Page 18 of 72 2.13 Maximising vitamin D status while minimising DNA damage during sun ex- posure can be achieved by several exposures per week to low doses of UV radiation. A study from New Zealand showed that the greatest increase in levels of 25(OH)D in serum over 8 weeks oc curred with sun exposure (measured using personal UV sensors) equivalent to less than half of a sunburning dose to the whole body each week.307 Higher exposures resulted in only small additional in- creases. However, a recent study showed that there was a high level of individ- ual variability in the achieved 25(OH)D concentration for a given dose of UV irra- diation.83 In Manchester , UK (53\u00b0 North), repeated doses of UV radiation suffi- cient to increase 25(OH)D levels from 36 to 54 nmol/L in people with fair skin did result in DNA damage to skin cells, but this was at least partially cleared by natu- ral repair processes by 24 hours after the las t exposure. The level of DNA dam- age at the completion of the 6 -week course of irradiation in the Manchester study was similar to that caused by a single exposure, suggesting DNA damage does not accumulate following exposure to repeated non -sunburning doses of UV radi- ation.104 Recent research shows that there are many mutations in cancer -related genes in the sun -exposed skin of older adults - a comparable mutation load to that of many internal cancers (e.g. , breast, uterus). However, these exist largely without causing clinical disease, due to efficient DNA repair and containment pro- cesses.221 Concentrations of 25(OH)D are increased in proportion to the amount of skin ex- posed to the sun,181 particularly at lower levels of UV -B irradiation.43 These re- sults sugge st that regular, low exposures to UV radiation can increase/maintain 25(OH)D levels while minimising DNA damage. While sunscreens can be de- signed that maximise UV -B transmission for vitamin D production and provide ex- cellent protection from UV -A irradiatio n,184 greater DNA damage also will result from the increased UV -B transmission so use of these sunscreens is not cur- rently advised. 3 Potential effects of current and future changes in strato- spheric ozone, UV radiation and accelerated climate change on terrestrial ecosystems 3.1 Large ozone -driven changes in cli mate in the Southern Hemisphere have occurred over the past 3 -4 decades and these climate changes are continu- ing to influence ecosystems in a variety of ways. Ozone depletion has played a major role in driving changes in temperature across certain parts of Antarctica and has also been implicated in changes in precipitation patterns across the Southern Hemisphere and into Asia46, 288 (see also section 1). Consistent with ozone -driven changes in temperature, plant growth rates and c arbon storage in moss beds have increased over the past several decades at various locations on the Antarctic Peninsula and nearby islands.292 The seasonality of prec ipitation along with the magnitude of diurnal changes in temperature are the dominant factors influencing the distribution of high elevation woodlands of Polylepis Page 19 of 72 tarapacana (Rosaceae), a species of high conservation value in the South Ameri- can Altiplano. Models predict that , by the end of this century , there will be signifi- cant (up to 56%) reduction in the potential habitat of this species due to in- creases in aridity . These findings add to the increasing evidence indicating per- vasive and far -reaching effe cts of ozone -driven climate change on terrestrial eco- systems . 3.2 The increasing pressures of multiple environmental stress factors together with changes in plant exposure to UV radiation continue to highlight the potential interactions of the different stressors. The balance between initia- tion of severe stress reactions and stimulation of normal regulatory pathways for growth and development has significant implications for plant growth and plant yield.46 Severe stress may occur from exposure of plant s to increased UV radia- tion together with environmental conditions such as climate extremes of tempera- ture and drought. Although m echanisms differ, generation of potentially damag- ing reactive oxygen species (ROS, viz., hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, su- peroxide radicals, and singlet oxygen) is a shared consequence of all these stressors , including ground level ozone. With incre ased ROS, there may be in- creased damage and reduced plant vigour.81, 151, 216, 236 The effectiveness of anti- oxidant defense systems that aid in removing ROS is dependent not only on the level of stress but als o on crop cultivar.70 Likewise, selection of certain crop breeding lines with greater antioxidant capacity188 can improve the tolerance of agricultural crops to UV radiation, especially in areas of high UV radiation and other stressful conditions. 3.3 Research in the ways in which p lants sense an d respond to UV radiation using multiple molecular mechanisms, has increased our fundamental un- derstanding of the impacts of UV radiation and other stressors. Studies of plant perception of UV radiation show that , although many plant regulatory re- sponses to UV -B radiation can be effected through the specific UV -B photorecep- tor (UVR8 ), other photoreceptors are also likely to be involved in the wide range of plant response to multiple environmental conditions.39, 226, 236 Exposure to UV - B radiation causes changes that affect plant growth and development , which are mediated by UVR8 or other mechanisms . These processes include metabolic changes, regulation of plant development, and plant acclimation and stress toler- ance to UV radiation40, 343, 396, 402 and responses to other stressors such as plant pathogens.86 The clarification of the molecular mechanisms by which plants per- ceive and respond to UV radiation enhances our ability to increase crop yield and control pests through management and breeding practices.26 3.4 Certain male and female plants of the same species respond differently to elevated UV -B radiation with potential consequences for changes in popu- lation composition and diversity. The response of many dioeciousd trees and shrubs to enhanced UV -B radiation depend s on whether they are male or female. In some species , males are more sensitive, in others , sensi tivity is more pro- nounced in females. For example, in white mulberry, Morus alba , female plants d Having m ale and female reproductive organs in separate individuals . Page 20 of 72 show more negative effects in their morphology, physiology, biomass allocation and leaf structure than do males under enhanced UV -B radiation . This is likely due to the greater requirement of female plants for resource s for reproductive de- velopment.69 Enhanced UV -B radiation tends to decrease biomass and leaf thick- ness in male plants of the dark leaved willow ( Salix myrsinifolia ), which, along with the UV -induced increase in leaf phenolics in females, suggests that the fe- males have greater tolerance to UV -B radiation compared to males.274 In a field trial with European aspen, Populus tremula, the female plants exhibited higher emission rates of volatile compounds (e.g., isoprene ), an indication of stress response. In addition, there was greater compositional variability in their emiss ions under UV -B radiation than that in male plants.218 UV-B radiation also increases production of tremulacin, a n herbivore defense -compo und that is abun- dant in aspen seedlings.42 Concentration of this compound was increased by 4 and 11% under ambient and elevated temperature, respectively, but only in fe- male seedlings, which grew taller than males.273 This change in chemistry may increase fitness of female s to resist herbivores when exposed to enhanced levels of UV -B radiation. Howev er, in some instances, male plants show a greater toler- ance to increased UV -B radiation than do females, as evidenced in another pop- lar, Populus cathayana .391 The varying tolerance to UV -B radiation by male and female plants has implica- tions for their population distribution and competitiveness with other species, which may alter plant di versity depending on whether male or female plants show greater or lesser tolerance to high levels of UV -B radiation. 3.5 The distribution of plants is being altered by climate change such that the plants are being exposed to a unique set of environmental cond itions to- gether with UV radiation. Studies examining the response of plants along natu- ral gradients of UV radiation are providing new insights into the mechanisms by which migrating species may acclimate or evolve to these changes in UV radia- tion. Many pl ant species are spreading to higher elevations and/or latitudes in re- sponse to climate change and this movement is expected to continue well into the future .163 Some evidence suggests that intro duced species display higher mi- gration potentials than native species, at least along elevation gradients.380 Whether there are diff erences in UV acclimation or adaptation potentials between native vs introduced species is unknown, although a study by Wang et al.362 indi- cates differences in UV sensit ivity between introduced tree ( Triadica sebifera ). However , in this case, introduced populations were more sensitive to UV -B radiation than native populations. It is generally accepted that plant species or populations which have evolved in environments differing in exposure to UV radiation (e.g., high vs low elevations; high vs low latitudes) often exhibit differential sensitivities to UV radiation, alt- Page 21 of 72 hough the mechanisms responsible for these differences are not fully under- stood. Certain studies have shown that UV -screening within a species varies along elevation gradients (e.g., ref.295). A study by Wang et al.364 on high vs low elevation populations and species of rockcress ( Arabidopsis ) further suggests that this differential sensitivity to UV radiation is due, in part, to population differ- ences in DNA damage and repair. Interactive effects of factors related to climate change may influence tolerance to UV radiation along elevation gradients, since increasi ng temperature can also reduce the levels of UV -absorbing compounds (e.g., ref.321). 3.6 Many plants can sense and respond to rapid (minutes to hours) fluctua- tions in UV radiation in ways that enhance their levels of UV protection . These changes have implications for the timing of plant defense and the use of UV radiation to improve food plant quality and vigour in controlled environments. In nature, plants experience substantial variation in exposure to UV radiation over time scales ranging from seconds to days as a result of seasonal and diur- nal rhythms in solar elevation,22 shifting cloud cover,103 and gaps in plan t cano- pies.148 Whereas considerable attention has been given to understanding plant responses to changes in average UV radiation conditions that occur as a result of ozone depletion ( refs 41, 46 and references therein), far less is known about re- sponses of plants to rapid fluctuations under solar UV radiation. There is increasing evidence that plants can adjust their UV screening levels (Fig. 5 A ) over a growing season (e.g., ref. 247), from one day to the next,328 over the course of a single day,28 and in response to rapid changes in cloud cover.30 A recent survey of 37 species growing in differen t locations has shown that the di- urnal adjustment in UV screening is widespread among plants, although it varies substantially among species ( Fig. 5 B).29 The changes in UV screening over the day are rapid (within minutes), reversible, and are linked to changes in the levels and types of UV sunscreens (flavonoids and related phenol ics30). How plants achieve these rapid adjustments in UV radi- ation protection is not entirely clear, since the induction and accumulation of UV - absorbing compounds and resultant changes in UV screening typically occur over time frames (days) tha t are considerably longer than these rapid changes.368 Plants are known to exhibit diurnal changes in gene expression, me- tabolites and the activities of key enzymes involved in the synthesis of UV -ab- sorbing compounds155, 178, 331 but whether a linkage exists between these mole c- ular changes and rapid adjustments in UV -screening is unknown. Page 22 of 72 The finding that plants can adjust their UV sunscreens over the day has im- portant implications for the timing of plant responses to other abiotic and biotic stresses (e.g., drought and herbivory) that can vary in severity over the course of a day, (e.g., ref.122), and which often employ similar suites of secondary com- pounds for both defense and UV radiation p rotection.26 The existence of a tem- porally dynamic UV protection system in plants also has practical co nsequences for how plant UV radiation research is conducted170 and the culturing of plants in controlled environments when UV -B (and UV -A) radiation from artificial sources is employed to enhance food plant quality and vigour.305, 367 3.7 The combination of UV radiation and constraints from climate change, such as drought and increasing temperatures, have the potential to change crop yield and food quality. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and high temperatures have an accelerating effect on ripening of some crops, which can result in an imbalance between certain plant pigments (anthocyanins) and sugar content, leading to a reduction in anthocyanins.224 In grape berries, where anthocyanins confer colour, taste, and also function as antioxidant s and in UV-protecti on,284 there are indications that UV radiation stimulates production of anthocyanin, which improves the anthocyanin to sugar ratios.224 The extent of these effects will likely be variable and dependent on location, type of plant crop, Fig. 5. The location of UV sunscreens in plant leaves and the diurnal changes in UV sun- screen protection. A. shows a cross -section of a leaf of a typical broad -leaved plant illustrat- ing the arrangement of major cells and tissues and the location of UV sunscreens (flavonoid pigments) in epidermal tissue.

Page 23 of 72 capacity for acclimation, duration of th e stress conditions, and the influence of the interacting factors with ambient levels of solar UV radiation.88, 314, 326, 368 3.8 Effects of increasing carbon dioxide may ameliorate potentially negative combined effects of UV -B radiation and drought. A recent study found that el- evated leve ls of CO 2 could have a beneficial effect on response of plants to drought.330 Carbon dioxide and water vapour exchange occurs through plant openings, the stomata, and studies find that UV -B radiation causes stomata to close (e.g., r efs 145, 245, 338). However, several s tudies also show that UV -B radia- tion stimulates the opening of stomata, (e.g., refs 99, 165). At the same time, an in- teractive effect can occur between drought and UV -B radiation (e.g., ref.93), while elevated CO 2 may ameliorate observed negative effects from both UV -B radiation and drought.372 In contrast, UV -B radiation may counteract the accelerating effect of carbon dioxide on ripening of crops such as grape berries,223 which, for certain crop quality traits, is seen as a positive effect of UV-B radiation. Simultaneous, naturally occurring environmental factors increase the challenge of reliably predicting the overall impact of changes by UV -B radiation on natural ecosystems or agricultural, horticult ural, or silvicultural productivity. 4 Interactive effects of UV radiation and climate change on aquatic ecosystems New data on the effects of radiation on aquatic ecosystems and how the se sys- tems respond to extreme events demonstrate the important role of UV radiation for food security and ecosystem services , including altering water quality, fishery productivity, effects of contaminants such as microplastics and synthetic sun- screens, and the potential for solar disinfection of parasites and pathogens. 4.1 Incre ases in terrestrial dissolved organic matter are decreasing exposure to UV radiation in many aquatic ecosystems . This widespread phenomenon known as \"browning\" is orders of magnitude more important in regulating exposure to UV radiation than are changes in stratospheric ozone, and is altering the structure and function of inland and coastal aquatic ecosys- tems in fundamental ways . Browning has reduced the UV-transparency of many inland waters in North America and Europe because the dissolved organic matter ( DOM) selectively absorbs shorter UV wavelengths of sunlight ( Fig. 6 ). Browning is caused primarily by recovery from anthropogenic acidification related to clean air legislation in the 1990s combined with increases in annual precipita- tion related to climate change. Recovery from acid deposition increases the solu- bility of DOM in soil by reducing the ionic strength of solutions, thus reducing the Page 24 of 72 coagulation of DOM.231 The implications for U V ex- posure have now been demonstrated using a unique data set on brown- ing in two lakes in north- eastern Pennsylvania, USA, where the depth to which 1% of subsurface UV radiation penetrates has decreased by as much as five -fold (from over 10 m to about 2 m, Fig. 7 ),375 far exceeding the effects of ozone depletion. In addi- tion to reducing transpar- ency of inland and coastal marine waters to UV radiation , browning alters carbon cycling (see section 5), decreases water transparency to visible light, and is associated with increases in strati- fication that deprive bottom water layers of oxygen and make them a poor habitat for fish and other aquatic organisms.375 Effects of browning on fish and their zoo- plankton food can be negative,36, 109, 375 neutral287 or positive109, 176 depending on the depth and initial DOM concentration of the sys- tem.375 Thus, browning is an im- portant consideration for commer- cial fisheries. While reduction in exposure to UV radiation is not the only effect of browning, experimental evidence suggest s that this reduction is likely to play an important role in the spatial and temporal distribution of zoo- plankton, which are the key link in aquatic systems between phytoplankton and fish (see sections 4.4 to 4.7). Further insights into how other browning -related ef- fects on aquatic ecosystems (e.g., acidity, visible radiation, nutrients) alter food web and ecosystem responses to UV radiation will be enhanced where research uses a multiple stressor approach rather than studying single stresses. Recent evide nce shows that browning is now a widespread phenomenon in lakes and near -shore marine environments. Browning in high latitude lakes is linked to increasing vegetation, longer growing season, and thawing of permafrost that is Fig. 6. Similar to ozone in the atmosphere, dissolved or- ganic matter (DOM) in aquatic ecosystems selectively ab- sorbs UV radiation. The selectivity of absorption by DOM is not as strong as that of ozone, but stronger than that by smoke from wildfires. Adapted from Williamson et al. 2016.374 Fig. 7 .

If this gap can be filled, it would help clarify the role of UV radiation in these changing conditions in aquatic ecosystems. Also, the impli- cations for water quality, fishery productivity, and the potential for solar disinfec- tion of parasites and pa thogens important for food security and human health would become clearer. 4.2 Extreme weather alters exposure to UV radiation in aquatic ecosystems . The Earth is becoming warmer and wetter, and both temperature and pre- cipitation components of climate change can alter the transparency of inland waters to UV radiation .374 Drought can increase transparency of water (see sect ion 5.4) , while sus- tained heavy precipitation or extreme storm events can reduce water trans- parency to UV radiation and visible light ( Fig. 8 ). In California, patterns of increasing drought have been associ- ated with increases in the transparency to UV radiation of Lake Tahoe as well as increases in the severity and fre- quency of wildfires.374 Smoke from wildfires can reduce incident UV radia- tion by 8 -10%,265 or more, and reduce the ratio of UV radiation : visible light (PAR, photosynthetically active radiation, 400 -700 nm) by almost half ( Fig. 9 ).374 This stimulates a shallower distribution of zooplankton g razers in highly transpar- ent lakes influenced by smoke, with important consequences for aquatic food webs and ecosystem services (see sections 4.7 to 4.12 ). Several studies have investigated the effects of extreme precipitation events on water clarity more generally.142, 143, 325 Although they do not report changes in UV-transparency, the important role of DOM in regulating water transpare ncy, as well as the selective absorption of UV radiation by DOM, makes it likely that these broader changes observed in water clarity are also paralleled by changes Fig. 8 . Transparency of water to UV radia- tion and visible light decreases substantially following storm event periods with higher precipitation, but increases following perio ds of low precipitation during a similar time of year. Data are from Lake Giles, Pennsylva- nia, USA.

A critical knowledge gap is the lack of good data on the UV-transparency of aquatic ecosystems. 4.3 Climate -induced changes in glaci- ers, ice cover, and vertical water circulation are altering exposure to UV radiation in aquatic ecosys- tems by increasing the seasonal exposure of organisms to UV radi- ation and altering the vertical dis- tribution of these organisms. The physical state of water - ice vs liquid and how it moves horizontally and vertically - affect s the exposure of organisms to UV radiation. Conse- quently, the extent of adverse effects of UV radiation in aquatic ecosys- tems will vary . Accelerated climate change is reducing the duration of ice cover in inland and coastal wa- ters,217 thereby increasing seasonal exposure to solar UV radiation and visible light (Fig. 10 ).160 Glacial re- treat is increasing inputs of melt -wa- ter discharge and glacial particles into downstream lakes, reducing the penetra- tion of UV radiation.290, 319 Most aquatic organisms are plankton, passively carried by the water. Exposure of plankton to UV radiation partly depends on how deep and quickly they are circu- lated vertically near the sur- face of the water where UV radiation is highest. This cir- culation determines whether an organism receives a few minutes, several hours or no UV radiatio n each day. Cli- mate change and the effects of ozone depletion on at- mospheric circulation are ex- pected to have regionally variable effects on the depth of ocean mixing48 and ocean circulation (see section 1 .3 and ref . 288), which will either increase or decrease Fig. 9 . The ratio of incident UV: visible light at Lake Tahoe decreased by almost half during the 2013 Rim Fire in California. These changes in incident UV: visible light can alter the vertical distribu tion of zooplankton in the lake (Urmy et al. 2016).346 Adapted from Williamson et al. 2016.374 4080120160200 210 230 250 270 290Incident UV:visible light ratio Day of year2009-2012 average 2013 Rim Fire Fig. 10 .

Page 27 of 72 UV exposure of plankton. In the Southern hemisphere, shifts in the latitudinal po- sition of atmospheric circulation cells due to ozone depletion over the South pole also change the position of ocean currents with consequences for distribution of marine species distributions and sub tidal marine communities. Cetina-Heredia et al.66 reported that recent intensi fication of the East Australia Current (EAC) influ- enced the dispersal patterns of eastern rock lobster, such that this species range was ultimately shifted southward by ca 270 km. The predicted incursions of warm, nutrient -poor water from the EAC along eas tern Tasmania have also in- creased in strength, duration, and frequency of the incursions which has contrib- uted to regional declines in the extent of giant kelp beds, marked changes in the distribution of nearshore fish, and allowed northern warmer -water sp ecies to col- onise Tasmanian coastal waters.168 Declines in growth rates in Brazilian corals since the 1970s have been linked to increasing temperatures of the sea surface, which were correlated with ozone depletion.102 4.4 Anthropogenic activity is causing water temperature, dissolved carbon di- oxide, nutrient loading, and stratification to all increase in aquatic ecosys- tems. The interactive effects of these changes can either w orsen or ameliorate the negative effects of UV radiation on bacteria, phytoplankton (small suspended algae) and seaweed (e.g., kelp). Recent studies of the interactions between the effects of climate change and those of UV radiation in aquatic organisms co nfirm and extend previous results over the last decade.138, 344 High temperatures of wa- ter usually enhance the ability of organisms to repair UV radiation damage, t hus reducing negative effects as long as the increase in temperature does not put an organism near its upper tolerance limit.276, 356, 382 On the other hand, increased thermal stratification in lakes291, 374 is reducing nutrient supply to phytoplankton; as is already known for the open ocean,48 this usually increases sensitivity of phytoplankton to UV radiation.35 Less straightforward are the interactive effects of increased CO 2 and associated acidification of seawater,68, 201 and nutrient load- ing (e.g. , from urban and agricultural runoff), which can either worsen or amelio- rate effects of UV radiation on phytoplankton and bacteria depending on the con- ditions and species involved.63, 95, 357 These new studies add to an emerging un- derstanding that the effects of UV radiat ion interact with multiple anthropogenic changes in the aquatic environment and these changes affect how phytoplankton and bacteria acquire and store essential elements (C, N, P). These organismal responses can result in an increase or decrease in sensitiv ity to UV radiation through changes in the capacity for repair and photoprotection. Similarly, after acclimation, low UV radiation, typical of the Arctic, can have little effect on en- demic seaweeds (kelps) under normal conditions, but can actually increase kelp growth under CO 2 enrichment.123 4.5 New evidence suggests that , despite the presence of UV protective mecha- nisms, tropical zooplankton as well as mid -latitude fish , amphibians, and aquatic insects are sensitive to the negative effects of UV radiation with po- tential implications for fish stocks. Zooplankton are key components of the diet of juvenile fish and have been shown to be sensitive to UV radiation. Even in Page 28 of 72 tropical regions with naturally high UV radiation such as the Red Sea,3 where or- ganisms are expected to be more tolerant to UV radiation, they display high UV sensitivity. Furthermore, Won et al.381 demonstrated that zooplankton exposed to UV radiation in laboratory experiments allocate energy to DNA repair at the cost of growth and reproductio n. New information has added to our understanding of how the negative effects of UV radiation on zooplankton can be counteracted by increasing concentrations of UV defense compounds such as carotenoids, melanin, and mycosporine -like amino acids.160, 248, 249, 304 Mycosporine -like amino acids can be transferred through the food web from phytoplankton t o zooplankton,160 thus conferring toler- ance to UV radiation to the latter organisms. Adequate vitamin D 3 in the phyto- plankton food source also enhances UV -tolerance of certain zooplankton.76 Fur- thermore, several zooplankton species can sense and escape UV radiation by migrating to deeper waters.100, 139 This migration t ransports nutrients and carbon vertically within the water column and changes nutrient availability for phyto- plankton as well as the availability of zooplankton as food for fish. Evidence continues to accumulate that UV radiation is a direct stress facto r for fish, amphibians, and their aquatic insect food resources. For example, juveniles of a common reef fish show elevated respiration and lower feeding rates when exposed to UV radiation under laboratory conditions.350 However, at times the UV radiation can confer resistance to anthropogenic environmental stressors. For instance, exposure to UV radi ation increases the resistance of spotted salaman- ders to a formulated herbicide containing glyphosate .197 Under laboratory condi- tions, aquatic insects such as damselfly larvae increase their UV -protective mela- nin content but display impaired growth under UV radiation,85 although enhanced melanin production in these larvae was also associated with a reduced immune response in adults.85 These responses of zooplankton and aquatic insects - criti- cal components in aquatic f ood webs - to UV radiation may be important for the growth, survival, and reproduction of fish and amphibians, including commercially important species. In some instances, exposure to UV radiation increases toler- ance to contaminants, although the mechanism s for this still need to be eluci- dated. 4.6 The response of organisms such as fish, zooplankton, and other crusta- ceans, to UV radiation is influenced by multiple environmental factors. Re- cent studies considering interactive effects between UV radiation and other stressors of environmental change have shown new responses in both inverte- brates and vertebrates. The effects depend on the species, and the magnitude of the stressors, their timing and type. Earlier ice -off (ice thaw) has been observed in many lakes and in the ocean217 and this will expose plankton to higher UV ra- diation stress in spring. Calanus, the most important group of zooplankton to sup- port North Atlantic fisheries, accumulate s photoprotective compounds from their diet in synchrony with the breaking up of the ice (ice -out)160 but it is not known if they can change the timi ng of this UV protection if the ice -off continues to be ear- lier in the future. In other systems, pigments that could protect zooplankton from Page 29 of 72 UV radiation make them more susceptible to fish predation due to these pig- ments increasing their visibility to the se visual predators. A trade -off between UV - protection and risk of being consumed leads to the extent of pigmentation being reduced in the presence of fish odour within two weeks.54 Although the mecha- nism by which this happens is not known, it may involve changes in either the production or accumul ation of pigments of different types.54 4.7 Tolerance of predators to UV radiation as well as the nut rient content of foods can change the response of organisms in aquatic food webs to UV radiation. The geographic distribution of UV -sensitive predatory invertebrates in lakes expands when increased DOM provides a refuge from damage by UV radi- ation. Consequently, the resulting increased predation by these more protected invertebrates leads to elimination of populations of their main prey, fairy shrimp.205 This demonstrates the key role of transparency of water to UV radia- tion for predators and their prey. In coastal marine systems, higher quality food with more nutrients can increase tolerance of amphipods (shrimp -like crustaceans) to UV radia tion.349 It has also been demonstrated that amphipods obtain UV -absorbing compounds from their macroalgae (seaweed s) food, when exposed to UV radiation.351 Reductions in exposure to UV radiation and the nutrient content of food can thus alter the fun- damental nature of consumer -resource interactions and lead to the reduction or elimination of key invertebrate species in aquatic ecosyst ems. 4.8 Changes in UV radiation can alter the behaviour of keystone zooplankton species. Solar UV radiation is an important behavioural cue in many aquatic or- ganisms for orientation, communication, and mate -selection.376 Zooplankton ex- hibit stron g behavioural responses to UV radiation that can have profound eco- logical consequences because they are perhaps the most abundant animals on Earth. They also play a fundamental role in water quality by consuming algae, and are the single most important foo d component for juvenile fish. The strong behavioural responses to UV radiation may thus alter aquatic food webs and fish- ery productivity. Two recent in situ studies demonstrated distinct behavioural avoidance of natural solar UV radiation in highly transp arent lakes.110, 195 Daytime depth distribution was not related to visible light, thermal structure, or the pres- ence of fish, but instead deepened with increased tran sparency to UV radiation and depth of food resources.110 In another recent study that examined the behav- ioural response of nine species of freshwater calanoid copepods (one of the most abundant types of zoopl ankton in lakes and oceans) from 15 populations, these copepods displayed not only the anticipated avoidance of the damaging UV radi- ation in natural sunlight, but also attraction.258 Attraction was predominant in ani- mals from more UV -transparent systems, suggesting that UV radiation is used as a cue for habitat selection, potentially allowing these copepods to utilize food re- sources in surface waters and avoid overlap with less UV -tolerant competitors or predators.258 Instantaneous UV -avoidance may also be species -specific where some species seek refuge in deeper waters when exposed to UV radiation, whereas other species have little or no behavioural response to UV radiation.139 Page 30 of 72 These less behaviourally responsive groups likely rely o n other adaptations to avoid damage from UV radiation.139 Furthermore, a recent study has demon- strated that stomatopod crustaceans (mantis shrimp) have selective UV filters in their eyes allowing them to utilize UV photoreceptors in well -lit surface waters.44 Smoke from drought -related wildfires and biomass burning as well as increase d input of UV -absorbing DOM may reduce underwater exposure to UV radiation (see sections 4.1 and 4.2), leading to a shallower depth distribution of zooplank- ton in highly transparent lakes.346 These observations are consistent with the proposition that transparency regulates the relative importance of UV radiation vs visual predation risk as factors driving vertical migration of zooplankton in lakes.373 Hence, even though UV radiation is harmful to zooplankton and other invertebrates if exposure is high, UV radiation is also a natural environmental cue affecting orientati on and vertical distribution in clear -water systems. In addition to changes in quality of water, the critical importance of zooplankton in aquatic food webs means that these changes in behaviour in response to UV radiation have important implications for f ishery productivity. Responses to UV radiation alter the depth distribution of zooplankton and thus their vertical overlap in the water column with their algal food resources as well as fish predators. 4.9 New models of productivity of phytoplankton enable estimates of inhibitory effects of UV radiation at an oceanic scale. Initial e stimates of productivity for the Pacific Ocean are about 20% lower than predictions that ignore inhi- bition by UV and visible radiation . Decades of studies ha ve demonstrated that near-surface inhibition of phytoplankton photosynthesis by ambient UV radiation and, to some extent, excessive visible radiation, occurs in most marine and freshwater systems.141, 241 New research is providing critical information that is needed to generalise these observations to ocean -scale models in order to esti- mate the importance of the effects of UV radiation on the oceanic carbon budget. Particularly important are the new descri ptions of the effectiveness of specific wavelengths for inhibition by UV radiation of the key primary producers in open ocean systems, using Biological Weighting Functions (BWFs) . These primary producers are the smallest planktonic algae, called picophytop lankton.242, 243 Based on these BW Fs, an initial study found that model estimates of total pri- mary productivity in the Pacific Ocean (including the whole water column) are ca 20% lower than estimates that ignore inhibition effects.243 Predictions show the strongest inhibition by UV-A and visible radiation in the near -surface zone where UV-B radiation is present, thus model estimates of the absolute effects of even an \"ozone -hole\" scale enhancement of UV -B radiation are minimal (<2% through- out the water column).244 Global estimates of the distribution of phytoplankton in aquatic environments will also be improved by better monitoring through satellite remote sensing,200 which will be augmented by the new Sentinel 3 mission in which a triad of platforms will be launched over a four -year period (2016 -2020). Taken together, these ad- vances will improve our ability to estimate how marine productivity is affected, at Page 31 of 72 present a nd in the future, by the interaction between ocean environmental condi- tions (such as temperature, mixing depth, ocean acidification, pollutants, and transparency) and UV radiation sensitivity of phytoplankton. 4.10 Warmer water temperatures and decreasing trans parency of water to UV ra- diation are increasing suitable habitat s for many waterborne pathogens . Consequently, this may increase or decrease their infectivity , with implications for human health . Many waterborne pathogens and parasites such as Cholera, Giar- dia, and Cryptosporidium cause severe gastrointestinal and other health prob- lems, but infectivity is generally reduced when pathogens are exposed to solar UV radiation (both UV -B and UV -A radiation.98). Increased water temperature23, 254 and decreased transparency to UV radiation - both due to accelerated climate change377 (see also 4.1 and 4.2), are increasing the infection potential and amount of habitat available for these pathogens and parasites. However, reduc- tions in trans parency to UV radiation caused by DOM or other dissolved and par- ticulate substances may lead to an increase in mosquito -borne diseases such as malaria and Zika . Aquatic mosquito larvae ( Aedes aegypti ) can be controlled by certain fungi, but these fungi are themselves sensitive to UV -B radiation.194 Therefore, the effectiveness of these fungal control agents will likely increase in environments with reduced UV radiation transparency.294 4.11 Compounds in sunscreens used by humans to reduce damage by UV radia- tion are contaminants of growing concern that have many detrimental im- pacts on aquatic ecosyst ems. Like many pharmaceuticals and personal care products, substantial quantities of sunscreen compounds enter aquatic ecosys- tems around the planet.179 These c ompounds are found in areas with large hu- man populations and frequent beach use as well as remote regions such as the Arctic.12, 50, 342 Sunscreens also are found in urine of humans 116 and can be pre- sent in high concentrations in wastewater effluent, but can be removed via exist- ing treatment practices and exposure to solar UV radiation in surface waters.204, 341 UV radiation -induced degradation can be faster in freshwater ecosystems than in marine ecosystems due to higher concentra tions of natural sensitisers in lake water, possibly reactive nitrogen compounds , which speed up degradation in freshwaters.187 Anthropogenic sunscreen compounds have been detected in many aquatic or- ganisms such as mussels and fish.299 Some of these compounds can transfer from mother to offspring in aquatic mammals such as Amazon river dolphins6 and can bioaccumulate in aquatic food webs.193 These compounds have a wide range of negative ecological effects.297 For example, some compounds, such as the common UV sunscreen compound, oxybenzone, are endocrine disruptors in both vertebrates and invertebrates .259 Laboratory experiments with these com- pounds have shown that, at concentratio ns higher than those in the natural envi- ronment , the sex ratio of freshwater fish can be skewed .182 Other compounds are toxic to phytoplankton such as diatoms115 and midges259 and can facilitate Page 32 of 72 bleaching of coral.342 Thus, widespread application of synthetic sunscreens to re- duce damage by UV radiation could be having many unintended negative effects in aquatic ecosystems. 4.12 Degradation of plastic debris by UV radiation increases the concentration of microplastics in the environment, with potential ly substantial negative ecological consequences. Microplastics, which are commonly defined as plas- tic particles smaller than 5 mm in size, are a contaminant of growing environmen- tal concern.334 Exposure to UV radiation contributes to fragmentation of plastic debris in the environment, thereby generating microplastic fragments and contrib- uting to their degradation (see section 7.8) . This UV -induced fragmentation in- creases with warming temperature.94 Climate change and UV radiation therefore may interact to stimul ate increasing quantities of microplastic fragments, espe- cially in eastern Asia and the tropics where future increases in UV radiation are projected (see section 1). Studies show that microplastics are already wide- spread in both inland183 and marine aquatic ecosystems.213 Microplastics may have major detrimental environmental impacts on aquatic eco- systems through the release of toxic compounds or by inhibiti on of biological pro- cesses following ingestion. Exposure to UV radiation contributes to the release into the oceans of tox ic compounds from plastics including bisphenol A, phthalates, citrates, and Irgafos\u00ae 168 phosphate .327 Many passive filter-feeders , such as mussels , ingest microplastics.53, 352, 370 Howeve r, little is known about the ecological impacts of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems beyond single species or laboratory studies.19, 370 4.13 UV radiation and dissolved organic matter influence the types and quanti- ties of toxic byproducts formed during chlorine disinfection of drinking wa- ter. Disinfection byproducts are regulated by many governments because, at high concentrations, they are hazardous to human and animal health and can cause cancer.283 Exposure to solar UV radiation of water prior to treatment can reduce formation of disinfection byproducts.387 DOM that strongly absorbs UV ra- diation produces more disinfection byproducts.20, 202, 262 Furthermore, concentra- tions of disinfection byproducts can be high in reclaimed water because re- claimed water often contains more DOM compared wi th non -reclaimed water.157 UV radiation also breaks down contaminants such as the commonly prescribed Page 33 of 72 diabetes drug metformin,271 which forms potentially harmful disinfection byprod- ucts in water treatment11 and ends up in many aquatic ecosystems.49 5 Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on biogeochemical cycles in the environment 5.1 Climate change affects UV -induce d biogeochemical cycles. The term \"bioge- ochemical cycles\" refers to chemical and/or biological transformations of natural and man -made substances (e.g., carbon, halogen compounds, and contami- nants) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Biogeochemistry als o includes the transfer of substances across environmental boundaries. Figure 11 shows sche- matically how interactions between solar UV radiation and climate change affect processes or flows within and between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A key aspec t of this conceptual framework is movement of natural organic compounds from terrestrial to aquatic ecosys- tems. This trans- fer is enhanced by heavy precipi- tation events (e.g., storms ) and permafrost thawing, and may be reduced by droughts (Fig. 11). Increas ed frequency of heavy precipita- tion events, thawing of per- mafrost soils, and droughts are likely caused by anthropogenic climate change. Droughts enable wild-fires, which , in turn , increase the likelihood of per- mafrost soils. Im- portant implica- tions of thawing of the permafrost include release Fig. 11. Interactive effects of solar UV radiation and climate change on processes and flows within and between terrestrial and aquatic eco- systems. The processes or flows indicated by arrows are discussed in section s 5.2 -5.5 and 5.7. Key to symbols: Black arrows indicate link- ages between environmental factors: + shows an increase in a pro- cess or flow, - a decrease in a process or f low. Dashed arrows indicate direct effects of solar UV radiation on decomposer organisms. Grey ar- rows indicate the flow of carbon within ecosystems. Blue arrows indi- cate the flow of carbon from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. Green arrows refer to the p rocess of \"priming\" (see sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.5).

Page 34 of 72 of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) into the atmosphere (see section 5.5) and land erosion as the permafrost melts. 5.2 Solar radiation, including UV radiation, increases the rate of breakdown of dead plant material, and may be an important regulator of carbon storage in most terrestrial ecosystems, even where litter is exposed to sunlight dur- ing only a small fraction of th e year. An understanding of the extent to which solar radiation drives the breakdown (decomposition) of dead plant material (known as plant litter) is essential for quantifying how ongoing changes in solar radiation (see section 1.2) influence carbon stora ge and cycling in terrestrial eco- systems. Decomposition of plant litter via UV -induced processes has been shown to occur in arid -land ecosystems.17, 280 However, new studies suggest that exposure to solar radiation can stimulate the breakdown of plant litter in a range of ecosystem and plant litter types.16, 84, 117 For example, Mediterranean grass- land experiments , where UV24, 117, 203 or total solar radiation has been selectively filtered out 120, 393 have shown that exposure to sunlight stimulates microbial ac- tivity in plant litter (discussed in section 5.3) . In addition, breakdown of plant litter is substantially reduced when UV radiation is reduced due to changes in vegeta- tion cover from tree planting,10 or when plant litter mixes with soil.28, 150 The de- composition of plant litter is not only affected by solar radiation but also by other environmental factors such as water availability, and varies with time on annual, seasonal or even daily time frames.84, 120, 280 5.3 In terrestrial ecosystems, exposure to solar radiation, including UV radia- tion but particularly blue -green light, alters the chemical composition of dead plant material in ways that accelerate its breakdown by decomposer organisms. The decomposition of pl ant litter is a critical process for nutrient cy- cling and carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. Exposure to solar radiation can substantially increase the rate of subsequent breakdown of plant litter by de- composer organisms. Recent research has demonst rated that this \"priming\" ef- fect (see Fig. 11 ) results from solar radiation breaking down lignin, which makes sugars more available for microbial degradation.15, 16 Additionally, it is also now clear that stimulation of the breakdown o f plant litter results from exposure to both UV radiation and particularly blue -green radiation.15, 16 While the effective- ness of this process, and the relative effects of UV and visible wavelengths vary among plant species,16 the identification of the mechanism is an important step forward in our understanding of how solar radiation influences carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystem s. 5.4 Droughts and wildfires interact with solar UV radiation to affect carbon cy- cling. Evidence is accumulating that the intensity and frequency of droughts is increasing in some parts of the Earth as a result of climate change.147 In the Southern Hemisphere, droughts are additionally caused by the interactive effects of depletion of Antarctic stratospheric ozone and climate change288 (see section 1.3). Droughts and wildfires interact with UV -induced carbon cycling in various ways. For example, droughts may reduce the flux of coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) into inland and coastal waters, which results in increased trans- parency of water bo dies to solar UV radiation374 (see section 4.2). Page 35 of 72 Wildfires are important sources of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, to the atmosphere.101, 345 A new study301 has shown that boreal forest fires can transform soil organic matter (SOM) into compounds with greater UV - absorbing capability, compared to the pre -fire SOM, particularly at high fire tem- perature (> 600 -700 oC).301 This enhancement in UV-absorption by SOM may in- crease the fraction of SOM that is subject to UV -induced decomposition in water- sheds impacted by wildfires.366 Hence wildfires can be direct and indirect sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere, where the indirect source is due to the transformation of SOM into compounds with a higher UV-absorption.366 Furthermore, wildfires enhance the likelihood that permafrost soils will thaw and collapse.52 For exam- ple, up to 0.5 m of thaw settlement was observed after recent fires in Alaska , causing impoundment of water and further thawing of permafrost52 (see section 5.5). 5.5 Solar UV radiation increases the b iological availability of terrestrial dis- solved organic matter from thawing permafrost soils. Permafrost soils store approximately twice as much carbon than is presently contained in the atmos- phere.72 Global warming results in the thawing of permafrost soils and the re- lease of terrestrial dissolved organic matter (tDOM ) into surface waters, where it is subjected to UV -induced and biological degradation to produc e CO 2.79, 131, 329, 365 Owing to its high photoreactivity, tDOM from recent thawing of permafrost soils readily undergoes UV -induced degradation.78, 365 Exposure to solar UV radi- ation generally decreases the photoreactivity of permafrost tDOM but increases its bioavailability.77, 329 After exposure to solar UV radiation, Arctic permafrost tDOM was found to be >40% more labile to bacteria, compared with the same tDOM kept in the dark.77 An exponential increase in biotic tDOM degradation over time following permafrost thawing has been observed in Arctic surface wa- ters306 and is due to the UV -induced production of bioa vailable compounds from tDOM.77 Therefore, the increase in the bioavailability of tDOM by solar UV radia- tion (\"priming\") enhances the release of CO 2 from aquatic ecosystems (see Fig. ), similar to the effects of priming in terrestrial ecosystems (see also section 5.3). 5.6 Climate change enhances the UV -induced and biological production of pre- cursors of reactive species that p articipate in stratospheric ozone deple- tion. A new study363 has shown that low -lying tidal freshwater swamps may be important sources of chloroform 3) and bromoform (CHBr 3) to the atmos- phere. The reason is that sea -level rise and saltwater intrusion due to climate change bring halide ions (e.g., chloride ions (Cl-)) inland, where they react with tDOM in UV -induced processes to produce halocarbons.363 Thus climate change could enhance the UV -induced production and emissions of halocarbons that participate in stra tospheric ozone depletion . Such an effect would represent a positive feedback on solar UV radiation. Climate change may also affect the biological production of halocarbons in aquatic ecosystems.208, 324, 333 The biological formation of short -lived bromocar- Page 36 of 72 bons such as bromoform (CHBr 3) in seawater involves phytoplankton and dis- solved organic matter (DOM).208 The rate of formation of CHBr 3 was reported to depend on the chemical composition of DOM;208 humic acid facilitated the biolog- ical \"Browning\" of coastal and estuarine environments374 (see section 4.1) could enhance the biological production of short -lived bromo- carbons. Tegtmeier and coworkers333 estimat ed that, ozone depletion potential (ODP) -weighted emissions of CHBr 3 from the global ocean amount to 9% of ODP -weighted anthropogenic emissions of all long -lived ozone -depleting halocarbons. 5.7 Changes in solar UV radiation, whatever their cause (e.g., ozone super -re- covery or not) will affect how much carbon dioxide is taken up or released by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but the sign and magnitude cannot currently be defined. Some scenarios predict super -recovery of stratospheric ozone in t he extratropical parts of the Earth in the second half of this century, which would result in substantial decreases in solar UV -B radiation56 (see section 1.2). As a consequence, rates and the extent of UV -induced processes would de- crease and this decrease would have multiple effects across various areas, in- cluding biogeochemical cycles, but also air quality and health. For example, re- duced rates of UV -induced degradation of natural organic matter would result in less production of CO 2 in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. At present, the con- sequences of possible future changes in solar UV radiation for biogeochemical cycles can only be described in a qualitative way. 5.8 Stratospheric ozone super -recovery could lead to increased concentrations of terrestrially derived particulate organic matter in the ocean by reducing its UV-induced conversion to dissolved organic matter. Some of the plant - derived material coming from terrestrial ecosystems is transported to the ocean as terrestrially derived particulate organic matter (tPOM ) where most of it will be consumed by organisms but some will sink into the sediments or break down into DOM. Current research has indicated that light -induced conversion of tPOM to DOM (photodissolution) is primarily driven by the UV -B part of solar radiation that is sensitive to changes in atmospheric ozone207, 233, 302, 320 (see Fig. 11 ). Lower rates of UV -B-induced transformation of tPOM to DOM would lead to increased participation of tPOM in other aquatic processes including uptake into aquatic food webs and the transfer of tPOM into bottom sediments. The net result could be increased carbon storage in bottom sediments with reduced release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 5.9 The rates and nature of UV -induced biogeochemical cycling of chemical and biological contaminants may undergo changes by the latter part of the 21st century. The photodegradation of contaminants in aquatic ecosystems in- volves both direct and sensitised photoreactions.228 Possible future reductions in UV irradiance due to ozone recovery and reduced penetration of UV radiation into aquatic environments would result in increased persistence of contaminants associated mainly with decreased direct photo degradation rates. Direct photo- degradation results from the absorption of solar radiation by the contaminant it- Page 37 of 72 self. For many organic contaminants , such as pesticides and \"emerging chemi- cals\", e.g., pharmaceuticals, direct photodegradation is caused primarily by the shortest wavelength component of sunlight in the UV -B range (280 -315 nm). Sensitised photodegradation is initiated through light absorpt ion by another sub- stance in the system with the contaminant, such as CDOM in aquatic environ- ments,31, 233 which s hort-lived reactive transients that react with the contaminants.71, 185, 199, 212, 215, 230, 360 Recent developments in remote sensing techniques and surface measurements are providing new insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of the transients (e.g., hydrogen peroxide and superox- ide),268 as well as additional information on the spatial and temporal distribution of CDOM in aquatic ecosystems.177, 209, 255, 316, 403 Enhanced terrestrial runoff due to more frequent heavy precipitation events could resul t in increased concentra- tions of CDOM concentrations and reduced penetration of UV radiation into sur- face waters. Taking this climate -change effect together with potential super -re- covery of stratospheric ozone,56 one can speculate that the overall effect might be a shift from direct to indirect UV -induced transformations of chemical and bio- logical contaminants. 6 Interactive e ffects of solar UV radiation and climate change on tropospheric air quality and composition 6.1 Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is the main degradation product of HCFCs, HFCs, and HFOs in the atmosphere. A recent review confirms that amounts of TFA from these halocarbons are small relative to other sources and there- fore currently unlikely to pose a risk to humans and the environment. Few new studies on TFA have been published since the review by Solomon et al.317 In a study conducted in Beijing, China, between 2013 and 2014, mean measured concentrations of TFA in the atmosphere were reported to be 1.5\u00b10.2 ng m-3, mainly in the gaseous phase (1.4\u00b10.2 ng with little in the particulate phase (0.06\u00b10.008 ng m-3).135 The mean concentration in air is four -millio n times less than an occupational standard for protective action of 0.6 mg/m3 from the US De- partment of Energy PAC Database,347 suggesting that atmospheric concentra- tions pose minimal risk to humans. TFA is considered very stable in the environment; it is not degraded by the main atmospheric oxidants, the hydroxyl radicals (OH). However, it can be degraded under laboratory condi tions. A study has shown that TFA can be photolysed in water in the presence of electrolysed sulfuric acid (S 2O82-), UV radiation and visi- ble light (220 -460 nm).156 This process may have some utility in an industrial set- ting. Electrolysed sulfuric acid does not occur in nature and the reaction is only efficient under very acidic conditions -also not normally seen in nature -so that this reaction is of little relevance to the fate of TFA in the environment. 6.2 Several common compounds are currently being discussed as alternative refrigerants. The negative impacts of their uses on air quality are expected to be small, but do not appear to have been evaluated recently. These so - Page 38 of 72 called \"natural\" refrigerants include ammon ia, hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide, and are being considered as replacements for HFCs. Ammonia has long been used as a commercial refrigerant. Exposure to high concentrations has detri- mental impacts on human health. In the atmosphere, ammonia participate s in the formation of aerosols, thus affecting air quality but also contributing to climate cooling through scattering of solar radiation.313 Some model estimates of concen- trations of atmospheric ammonia are less than observed values by fa ctors of 2 -4, indicating that the sources and sinks of ammonia are not well known.32 Neverthe- less, full replacement of halocarbons by ammonia would still constitute a negligi- ble fraction (<1%) of cu rrent global ammonia emissions. Due to its toxicity, am- monia probably will not be used except in large -scale facilities279 where it cur- rently accounts for ca 15% of total refrigerant Short chain hydro- carbons (e.g. , propane and n-butane) are also being proposed as refrigerants, and could have some minor impacts on air quality ,355 although this does not ap- pear to have been recently re -assessed. Carbon dioxide has been used for many years as a refrigerant and has few consequences for air quality, but engineering challenges have limited its widespr ead use. 6.3 The recovery of stratospheric ozone is expected to reduce UV radiation in the troposphere outside of the tropics, decreasing ground -level ozone in cities but increasing it in rural areas. UV-B radiation is a significant driver in the generation of ozone at ground level, particularly in polluted environments, leading to a small but not insignificant dependence of air quality on stratospheric ozone.216 As a result, increases in stratospheric ozone will slow the production and destruction of ozone at ground level. Larger concentrations of ozone in rural areas will be detrimental to agriculture and natural ecosystems, while smaller concentrations in urban areas are expected to be less damaging to human health. Model calculations400 have suggested that UV -driven ozone destruction will be slower in rural areas, tending to increase its concentrations. In contrast, concentrations of urban ozone are expected to decrease due t o slower produc- tion in a lower -UV environment (see Fig. 12 ). However, this expectation is based on older models that did not have sufficient spatial resolution for confident as- sessment. Many other factors are equally or more important in determining ambi- ent concentrations of ozone. These include changes in emission of ozone precur- sors (nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds), and climate -driven changes in temperature, humidity, and stratospheric -tropospheric circulation.27, 219 As a result, the net effect of reductions in UV radiation and these other factors on ground level ozone remains uncertain, and a challenge for management of air quality. These changes in ground -level ozone may be exacerbated in the future if strato- spheric ozone amounts exceed pre -ozone depletion levels (\"super -recovery\"), as expected for middle and high latitudes under some representative emissions sce- narios.56 For example, at Northern Hemisphere mid -latitudes, the super -recovery could double rural ozone increments relative to those estimated by Zhang et al.400 for the \"normal\" rec overy to pre -ozone depletion levels. Over the tropics, small reductions in stratospheric ozone are expected, with only minor effects on ground level ozone.56 Under some proposed geo -engineering schemes , even Page 39 of 72 larger stratospheric ozone values would be expected at mid -latitudes, and could lead to additional increases (up to 5%) in global ground -level ozone,253 with po- tentially significant impacts on air quality. 6.4 Evidence linking po or air quality to adverse health effects on humans and the environment continues to mount, but the effects of individual pollutants remain difficult to discern because they frequently occur together. Because changes in stratospheric ozone will have small b ut potentially significant impacts on air quality at ground level,216, this has implications for human and environmen- tal health. A recent WHO Global Burden of Disease assessment for outdoor air pollution383 concludes that approximately 3 million premature deaths occurred globally in 2012 due to poor outdoor air quality. Other studies have arrived at similar estimates of mortality based on summing inferred effects of particulate matter (e.g., from industrial combustion processes, dust, fires) and ozone.196 However, there is difficulty in separating the effects of particulate matter and ozone because they generally co-occur.14, 58, 216 The combined impacts of air pollution and rising temperature are receiving in- creased a ttention. Epidemiologic studies of the 2003 European heat wave have ascribed a significant fraction of observed mortality to air pollution.108, 128, 322 Fig. 12. Schematic illustration of the evolution of ground -level ozone in urban air and its outflow, as a function of distance from emission sources. Dashed curve gives the refer- ence using current UV radiation, while the solid curve is for decreased UV radiation ex- pected upon recovery of stratospheric ozone. The green hatched area shows the result- ant decrease in urban ozone, while the red hatched area shows the increase in regional (background) ozone. Page 40 of 72 A rec ent clinical trial has directly investigated this interaction and found that sim- ultaneous experimental exposure to higher ozone and higher temperature was associated with a constellation of physiological responses indicative of slower dissolution of blood clots.172 Additional clinical trials are needed to further eluci- date these mechanisms in anticipation of future changes in both climate and air quality. 7 Materials damage due to solar UV radiation and temper- ature Exposure to solar UV radiation has adve rse effects on materials. Outdoor service lifetimes of materials are influenced if not determined by the rates of degradation through weathering. Increased exposure to UV radiation at some geographical locations coupled with rising ambient temperatures due to climate change , accel- erate the rates of degradation of materials. The consequent decrease in service life can be countered by stabilisation technologies in the case of plastics, and surface coating or treatment for wood products. Here we assess the rec ent ad- vances in understanding of the mechanism s of UV radiation -induced degradation that would help the development of stabilisers or coatings in commonly used plastics, wood, and textile materials. 7.1 Surface yellowing of wood on exposure to UV radiation is correlated with the extent of chemical modification, allowing simpler monitoring of oxida- tion rates in wood using yellowing measurements. Yellowing of wood45, 74, 296 and -red ative of solar UV -induced oxidative degradation of wood. These changes are more pronounced during initial stages of exposure45, 336, 405 and are localised in a thin surface layer of wood405 and bamboo.180 The fractional crystallinity of cellulose in bamboo increases during photodegrada- tion as the amorphous cellulose fraction is preferentially degraded.180 Monitoring the progress of the photooxidative reactions is critical in the development of pro- tective c oatings for wood62. However, the spectroscopic methods used are tedi- ous. The rate of yellowing was shown to be well correlated with changes due to oxidation as visualized by infra -red and novel hyperspectral imaging for photo- degradation o f chestnut wood under simulated solar UV radiation.45 A similar cor- relation was also reported between the residual lignin content and tensile strength during natural weathering of fir -wood.405 If generally applicable, such correlations allow easier, non -invasive measurements ( particularly yellowness in- dex) to be used to assess the progress of oxidative changes in the wood. 7.2 The effects of higher ambient temperatures and other factors on the ser- vice life of wood and plastics outdoors can now be better estimated. Out- door service life of common plastics such as polyethylene4, 392 and polypropyl- ene225 is determined primarily by dose of solar UV radiation and temperature of the sample . Relationships that estimate the increased weathering of these at Page 41 of 72 higher ambient temperatures are commonly available .25, 272 However, a relation- ship that also includes the intensity of solar UV irradiation, sample temperature, and the partial pressure of oxygen was recently reported and validated for poly- propylene (PP).214 This approach allows for a more re liable estimation of service life of PP. Similar effects hold fo r wood species such as wood of Norway spruce,136 as well as beech wood.337. The discoloration of beech wood at 20 -60 h of exposure to solar UV radiation was greater at 100% humidity than at 0%.337 As weathered wood and wood -plastic composites are more susceptible to subsequent biodeg- radation by decaying fungi outdoors,65, weathering promotes further degradation in these materials. This has implications for protection against UV -induced weathering of wood at locations of high ambient humidity coupled with high tem- peratures. 7.3 Heat treat ment of wood to control degradation by UV radiation shows mixed results with the majority of studies indicating no advantage in terms of UV stability. Industrial heat treatment of wood (at 180 -240\u00b0C) is claimed to stabilise the wood against solar UV radiation and weathering.7 Heat treatment of woods can yield a stable hydrophobic surface with improved resistance to de- cay.61 However, heat treatment of poplar, black locust246 and other varieties of wood190, 390 showed no such improvement in UV stability. Even where light -in- duced discolouration was controlled by this treatment, spectroscopic data still show ed marked degradation due to heat treatment.73 The presence of different types of extractives261, 312 in wood might account for the variability in results; ex- tractives are organic compounds in wood that can be extracted with solvents. Variables affecting the level of UV stability delivered by thermal treatment of wood must be further studie d before it can find widespread commercial use in outdoor applications . 7.4 Both b ulk chemical modifications and surface coatings effectively control solar UV -induced degradation of wood. Bulk modification of rubber wood with isopropenyl acetate to enhance their durability and hydrophobicity also improve their solar UV stability.239 In laboratory exposures to simulated solar UV radiation, the wood showed photobleaching instead of yellowing after 250 h of accelerated weathering, while the unt reated control yellowed deeply. Copper ethanolamine surface coating164 used to stabilise Ja panese larch wood against degradation by solar UV radiation can also be effective as a UV -protective primer as found for Southern pine wood.401 However, copper compounds are well known to leach out during use158 with potential environmental impacts. Conventional UV stabilisers used in surface varnishes that are effective in softwood and bright har dwood products do not prevent bleaching of dark woods (rosewood, ebony, mahogany, or black walnut) or heat -treated wood exposed to UV radiation.261 Better stabilis- ers that can control photodamage of dark wood need to be developed. 7.5 Lignin used as a filler in polypropylene acts as a stabili ser against degrada- tion by solar -simulated UV radiation . Lignin, a natural, complex organic poly- Page 42 of 72 mer, making up a large part of woody plant tissue, is also a byproduct of the pa- per industry, and is being used to increase stabilisation of materials because of its antioxidant properties. For example, l ignin filler is generally known to contrib- ute antioxidant properties in polyethylene and polypropylene (PP).114, 129 Com- pared to powdered wood, poplar -derived lignin is a superior UV stabiliser and an- tioxidant.264 The elastic modulus of composites filled with wood powder was re- duced by ca 30% when exposed to laboratory -accelerated weathering for 960 h, while no change (or even a slight increase) was obtained in lignin -filled PP under the same conditions. Use of wood -derived lignin as opposed to powdered wood in wood -plastic composites shows promise provided economic feasibility in large - scale manufacturing can be demonstrated. 7.6 Nanoparticles and nanofillers are increasingly used as effective solar UV stabili sers in materials. Nanofillers can act as UV stabilisers in plastics, wood144, 250 and in textile fibres.2 In spruce wood, for instance, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoplates generated in situ using a precursor absorbed into the wood , reduced total colour change by 75% compared to untreated wood after exposure to UV radiation for 102 h .134 A similar effect was found with nano -ZnO in poplar wo od,90 composites of beech wood and polyethylene275, and nanotitania in bamboo and polyethylene composite.275 These technologies are still at the research stage. Alt- hough they show promise as effective UV rad iation stabilising technologies, fur- ther development is needed before their practical importance can be assessed. Nanoparticles work similarly in protecting textile fibres. Recent laboratory studies have demonstrated the potential of surface treating text ile fibres with nanoparti- cles for improving their solar UV radiation stability. Nanoparticles of zinc oxide used with cotton,2, 189 nylon,281 and aramids361 show Nanoparticles of tita- nia 174, graphene,37 and gold 394 have also been explored for surface protection of fibres from UV radiation. For instance, cotton fibres , functionalised with ZnO and carbon nanotube nanocomposites at a level of 22 % by weight increased the UV protection factor (UPF) of cotton from 6 to 40.38 Treatments used in these studies have not been scaled up to allow assessment of their product ion in commercial processes. Also, their economic feasibility needs to be studied before they can be recommended for potential large -scale use. 7.7 Solar thermal collectors made of polycarbonate plastic have lower environ- mental impacts compared to conventiona l collectors made of glass and metal . However, they have shorter service lifetimes because of premature loss of optical and other properties on exposure to solar UV radiation. Solar thermal col- lectors made of plastic can be a practical and cost -effective t echnology for pro- duction of electricity.75 An all -polycarbonate collector in an aluminium frame weighs only a third of a conventional metal/glass collector but has been shown to be 8-15% lower in efficiency. However, it is lower in cost and the life cycle energy used in its manufacture is recovered in only 3.8 years of operation as opposed to 8.3 years for conventional collectors.67 A serious drawback of polycarbonate5 or polypropylene359 used in collectors is their loss of optical and other properties on Page 43 of 72 weathering. The service life of plastic encapsulants in conventional photovoltaic modules is also determined by weathering -related changes.169 Advances in stabi- lisation that improve the lifespan of plastics used in solar energy applications will help advance this clean energy technology. 7.8 Generation of micro - and nanoplastics in the marine environment is accel- erated by UV radiation as well as high temperatures. Combined effects of so- lar UV radiation and high temperatures cause plastic debris in the ocean environ- ment to break -up into micro - and nanoscale particles.192 These microplastics are present in oceans270 as well as freshwater bodies183 and they concentrate persis- tent polar chemicals in sea water and, via ingestion, provide a credible pathway of these chemicals into the marine food chain. (352 and section 4.12) Physiological effects of ing estion of these particles on a range of marine organisms have been reported.94, 370 Since generation of microplastics is a UV radiation -initiated frag- mentatio n process, better UV -stabilisation of plastic products, especially packag- ing products, will help slow down the rate of production of particles in the environ- ment.
