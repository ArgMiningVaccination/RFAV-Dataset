Thanks for sharing your story with us Laura. So, let's start at the beginning and we can move on from there. I have always had an expanded consciousness that allows me to be aware of and interact with subtle realities, energy, other people's states of being, and Spirit. If I had been born into an indigenous culture, I probably would have been handed over to the local Shaman for training. But, I found and followed my own meandering path to become a practitioner of various healing modalities to support my community on the Seacoast of New Hampshire. In the beginning, my mom brought me to a Spiritualist church hoping to find some answers and structure for the beyond. There, I was taught healthy boundaries with energy, like mediumship and psychic abilities. I learned Reiki. I went on to become a massage therapist and built a thriving practice in the Boston area and then later in Portsmouth, NH. By 2015, I had been practicing various healing and bodywork modalities for 20 years when I visited Peru for vacation. The tour included a trip to the Amazon Rainforest and traditional shamanic ceremony with the Ashaninka tribe. They hold the longest history of use of medicinal trees of the jungle. They also use ayahuasca, the visionary medicine of all of South and Central American shamans. While I was visiting, there was a patient who came to the jungle because his adrenals had failed and nothing in Western medicine had been able to bring him health. He ended up slipping on the rocks by a waterfall and suffered some serious injuries. He fell head first onto his chin, giving himself whiplash and some massive wounds on his chin and forearms. I watched as the shamans, with no stitches, used plant medicine and tape to close wounds in a matter of hours. And, these were deep wounds, where you could see the bone. Then, the shamans watched as I gave the man Craniosacral Therapy to address his whiplash. That day, they invited me to study plant medicine and shamanism with them. I have been visiting the tribe twice a year since, learning from a 200,000-year-old tradition that quite frankly, has a far better track record of healing than our allopathic care has ever had. On a regular basis, I see terminal cancer, autoimmune disease, hormone imbalance, anxiety and depression, addiction, abuse, toxicity, heart disease, and more be addressed and cured. Most people come to the jungle as a last resort, when everything else has failed. I have learned that for me, it's the first place to go. Overall, has it been relatively smooth? If not, what were some of the struggles along the way? I tell my clients that I get to cheat at life. I have always had spirit guides whispering in my ear. I have never been steered wrong along with my path. That is what it feels like to be in complete flow with your higher self and to be on your soul's path. Don't get me wrong, I have suffered. I've had pain, illness, and heartache. Five years ago, it was strongly suggested by guidance that I become vegan to keep my body clean. It took me years before I didn't crave cheese. And then came eliminating sugar and gluten... talk about suffering!... just kidding! But, I have been able to pull back the curtain and take a glimpse at the big picture. What are the gifts I have received by experiencing this suffering, pain or illness? Because if it's happening it is certainly in divine order and for my highest good. To be in healing work, you have to trust that there is not a single moment that is not meant to happen and that everything is absolutely perfect, for yourself and for everyone else on this planet. That is true freedom and the key to leaving victimhood behind. One of the biggest patterns I've had to clear was that of being seen for who I am and completely accepting myself as is. I would never had participated in an interview like this before this pattern was healed. I was still fearful of talking about energy and spirit. In the 80's and 90's, this stuff was not ok, and the judgment was pretty harsh. Alright - so let's talk business. Tell us about Seacoast Healing - what should we know? At Seacoast Healing, most of my time is spent with clients in individual sessions for healing. I see people who are sick, in pain, depressed and anxious. I also see people searching for meaning in life, who crave direction and want to find their soul's purpose. I've been seeing many more children than ever before. Parents are recognizing sensitivities in their little ones and they need subtle body support too. We address all aspects of a person; physical, mental, emotional and spiritual states. Once a week, we also hold group healing sessions. These allow more immediate energetic help for people. They are reminiscent of the traditional ceremonies held in the Amazon, wherein a short amount of time a tremendous amount of healing can occur. Workshops and classes are being developed. There is so much inspired wisdom from the indigenous tribes in South America, and that is what I am most excited to share with our community. Last fall we built a maloca. The maloca is the shamanic building in Peru where healing, ceremony and gathering happen. It was very clear that my office in Downtown Portsmouth would no longer hold the frequency needed to support the client's healing journeys. So, listening to spirit, we started to search for a new professional home. It happened to be in my backyard. Last October, with the help of clients, neighbors and friends, we erected our maloca; a 500 square foot yurt. This has been a game changer for the quality of sacred space held on a continuous basis for everyone who visits us, whether for healing, workshop or community gathering. Any shoutouts? Who else deserves credit in this story - who has played a meaningful role? Truth be told, the only thing I have to do is stay clean, clear and healthy. I have to do my own spiritual work. I have to walk the talk. All the hard work is done by each and every client and by the universal energies of healing, the spirits. I have had human teachers inspire me along the way for sure, but true clarity comes from listening to the subtle information of guidance. Meditate, meditate, is built on recommendations from the community; it's how we uncover hidden gems, so if you know someone who deserves recognition please let us "}
