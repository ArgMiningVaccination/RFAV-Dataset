Department of Botany, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria *E-mail of the corresponding author: safeadeniyi@yahoo.com Abstract The use of traditional medicine as alternative or c omplimentary therapy is gaining prominence in prima ry health care worldwide. This is because of the efficacy in the management of mild, chronic seemingly incurable ailments/diseases. Though the publicity is on the i ncrease from country to country in the world, howev er, one cannot conclude that the information has reached al l classes of people. This study therefore investiga ted identification, knowledge and consumption practice of herbal medicine among the hearing-impaired. The study adopted survey research design. A total of 50 stude nts with hearing impairment were selected from diff erent locations in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Traditiona l medicinal inventory was used to collect data with reliabilities of 0.72, 0.80 and 0.67 respectively based on percep tion, knowledge and consumption practices. Two rese arch questions were answered and two hypotheses tested. Result revealed wrong perception and low knowledge of traditional/alternative therapy. Also, there was no significant difference in the identification and c onsumption practice and no significant influence of religion o n consumption practice among the respondents. Based on the results, it is recommended that proper education sh ould be given to students with hearing impairment a bout traditional medicine.

Introduction Traditional medicine has remained the most affordab le and easily accessible source of treatment in pri mary health care system of poor communities where altern ative therapy is the major means of medical treatme nt in such communities (Yingar & Yewhalaw, 2007). The pot ency of such alternative medicine in African tradit ional communities cannot be over-emphasised. Over the cen turies, the indigenous people of the world have dev eloped sophisticated social systems and their traditional healers, through oral tradition and empirical means , have acquired and compiled knowledge regarding the use o f medicinal plants which has been disseminated from generation to generation (Abel & Busia, 2005). This has helped the continued survival of traditional/a lternative therapy. In the recent time, herbal medicine has received wo rldwide acclaim since medicinal plants continue to play crucial role in health care delivery system in urba n, semi-urban and rural communities. According to A zaizeh et al (2003) reported that about 80% of the world popu lation depend on traditional medicine for their hea lth care. This corroborated the findings of scholars that med icinal plants have helped in the management of mild , chronic or seemingly incurable ailments/diseases, and sever al ethnobotanical studies have been conducted to do cument traditional medical practices, plants used, method of preparation as well as the mode of administratio n et al , 1990). According to Principe (1991), in the developed coun tries, about 25% of the medical drugs are based on plants Journal of Education and Practice www.iiste.org ISSN 2222-1735 (Paper) ISSN 2222-288X (Online) V ol.6, No.15, 144 and their derivatives. In Nigeria, ethnomedical sch olars in the past and even now have made contributi ons to the development of the traditional medical system (Idu et al., 2009). This has led to recent awareness and clamour to start adopting this alternative medicinal therapy t o complement the conventional treatment that have b een widely reported to have serious adverse effect despite its positive effects on human health. Although at different regimina or dosages, herbal p reparations have been used for and by all age group s and sexes. The extent of acceptance and use of herbal c oncoction may depend on the individuals state of mi nd, level of awareness, medical challenges and religious beli efs. However, among people of the same religion, sex or otherwise, challenges in one or more domains of lif e may also be a critical factor. While previous research focus has documented the use of herbal or tradition al medicine by non-special needs subjects, report of use by spe cial needs especially among individuals with hearin g impairment be it within the school age or above are scarce in Nigeria. WHO (2011) reported that about 360 million people around the world live with disabling hearing loss out of which 32 million are children between age 0-15 years. Though, there has not been valid do cument reporting the exact number of people with he aring impairment in Africa and especially in Nigeria, it is wise to reason that the larger percentage will c ome from Africa because of poverty index, illiteracy and lac k of basic medical care coupled with unhygienic sta te of our communities. While people without disabilities are well informed about the latest in their environment, people with disabilities especially, the hearing impaired suffers double jeo pardy because of their condition. Information rarel y or inaccurately gets to them. This is because our soci ety has not imbibed inclusion strategy or culture. This study therefore was aimed at investigating the identification, knowledge and consumption practice s of herbal medicine among students with hearing impairm ent in secondary school in Ibadan Southwestern Nige ria with the aim of forming basis for counselling and a dvocacy. 2. Research Questions and Hypotheses Research Question 1: How do students with hearing impairment perceive he rbal medicinal plants? Research Question 2: What is the level of knowledge of students with hea ring impairment about alternative medicine? Hypothesis 1: There is no significant difference in identificati on practice of herbal medicine between male and female students with hearing impairment. Hypothesis 2: There is no significant influence of religion on c onsumption practice among students with hearing impairment. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1 Plant Materials Medicinal plants used in the management of common a ilments such as malaria, diabetes, ulcer, cholera, cough, asthma, typhoid, pile, headache and worm infection were collected fresh for display before the partici pants for the purpose of identification. The plants were iden tified by botanists who specialised in plant taxono my. They were Dr D.O. Aworinde and Mrs. S.M. Erinoso. Collection of samples of the plants used was done e arly in the morning and were preserved to maintain their freshness before the actual display before the part icipants. 4. Research Design The study employed survey research design of ex-pos t facto because the study only investigated existin g variables. 4.1 Population The population for the study were students with hea ring impairment in senior secondary schools in Ibad an, Oyo State. Journal of Education and Practice www.iiste.org ISSN 2222-1735 (Paper) ISSN 2222-288X (Online) V ol.6, No.15, 2015 145 4.2 Sample A total of 50 students with hearing impairment were purposively selected from senior secondary school three (SSS3) in Methodist High School, Bodija, Ijokodo Hi gh School and HLA, Agodi in Ibadan, Nigeria. They w ere purposively selected based on their availability an d expectation that they were matured and knowledgea ble enough to participate in such research. 4.3 Instruments Traditional medicine/alternative therapy inventory was designed to collect data. The instrument was designed by group of researchers that carried out this study. T his was divided into four sections, namely: Section s A, B, C and D. Section A was on the demography of the respo ndents, while B was based on the perception of some plant for food, medicine or for both designed in four sca les. Section B was designed in form of test to be a ble to determine their knowledge of medicinal plants while C was designed to gather information about consump tion pattern and practices among students with hearing i mpairments. The reliabilities of the instrument in Section B, C and D were 0.72, 0.80, and 0.67 respectively usin g cronbach alpha. 4.4 Data Collection The samples of medicinal plants gathered were initi ally displayed to aid the participants common knowl edge of some these plants found in their community. Thereaf ter, the researchers distributed the instruments am ong the participants with further explanation wherever occa sion called for such because of their peculiarity. The responses were later collected and properly checked to ensure accurate response to the items in the qu estionnaire. 4.5 Data Analysis The data collected were collated, coded and analyse d using simple percentage, frequency count and mean to answer research questions. Hypotheses were tested u sing t-test and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. 5. Result The analysis of the biographical data showed that m ajority .of the respondents (60.0%) were females. O nly 40.0% of them were males. On their ages, 56.0% of t he respondents were between 16 and 20 years. 40.0% were between 10 and 15 years old, while only 4.0% were b etween 20 and 25 years. The analysis of their relig ion showed that 48.0% were Christians, 50.0% were Musli ms while 2.0% do not belong to the two religions. Analysis of their ethnicity showed that 14.0% were Hausas, 12.0% were Igbos, 72.0% were Yorubas while 2.0% belonged to the group of others who do not bel ong to any of the three tribes. On their Nationalit y, 94.0% were Nigerians while 6.0% were non Nigerians. Research Question One: How do people with hearing i mpairment perceive herbal medicinal plants? Table 1: Perceptions of the hearing Impaired about Herbal Medicinal Plants Item Good as food Good as medicine Good for both Not good for both Bitter leaf pawpaw, guava leaf, scent leaf, almond tree leaf 29(58,0) Garlic bulb, bitter cola pineapple fruit 14(28.0) 25 (50.0) 9(18.0) (44.0) 8(16.0) 6(12.0) leaf 11(22.0) 29(58.0) bitter leaf, 24(48.0) 13(26.0) 5(10.0) 6(12.0) Percentages in parenthesis 2222-1735 (Paper) ISSN 2222-288X (Online) V ol.6, No.15, 2015 146 Table 1 above shows the responses of the hearing im paired on their perceptions about herbal plants pro vided. Majority of them (more than 40.0% in each case) agr eed that the plants listed as items 1,2,3.4,5,6, 10 and 12 are good for food: while majority of them (more than 50 .0% in each case) agreed that the plants listed as items 7,8.9 and 11 are good as medicine. Conclusively, in the o pinion of the respondents they agreed that the foll owing plants are good as food: i. Bitter leaf, pawpaw, guava leaf, scent leaf, almond tree leaf ii. Cat's eyes leaf, Bitter kola leaf iii. Sugarcane stem bark, watermelon, unripe plantain iv. Garlic bulb, ginger rhizome, scent leaf, pawpaw lea f v. Waterleaf, Ethiopian pepper vi. Locust bean seed, scent leaf vii. Lime fruit juice viii. Scent leaf, bitter leaf, alligator pepper seed On the other hand, they agreed that the following p lants are good as medicine i. Garlic bulb, bitter cola seed, ginger rhizome, pawp aw seed, pineapple fruit ii. Lemon grass leaf, cat's eye leaf, mango leaf iii. Lemon grass leaf, moringa leaf, neem leaf, bitter l eaf iv. Sorghum leaf, bitter leaf Research Question Two: What is the level of knowled ge of students with hearing impairment about alternative medicine? Table 2: Level of knowledge of students about alter native medicine No of Participants Mean Standard Deviation Maximum Minimum Range 50 2.18 1.240 4 0 4 Table 2 above shows the level of knowledge of stude nts with hearing impairment about alternative medic ine. Knowledge was measured with an achievement test wit h maximum score of 10. A mean of 2.18 out of a maximum score of 10, coupled with a maximum score o f 4 showed that the level of knowledge of students on alternative medicine is very low. Hypothesis One: There is no significant difference in identification and consumption practice of herba l medicine between male and female students with hear ing impairment Table 3: T-test Analysis of identification of herb al medicine Gender N Mean S.D. T Df p-value Remark Male 30 Not significant Table 3 presents the t-test comparison of the score s of male and female students with hearing impairme nt identification of herbal medicine. The t-test compa rison showed that the mean difference in identifica tion of herbal medicine between male and female students wi th hearing impairment is not statistically signific ant (T- calculated = 0.725, df = 48, P > 0.05). We therefor e accept the null hypothesis. It therefore follows that from the Journal of Education and Practice www.iiste.org ISSN 2222-1735 (Paper) ISSN 2222-288X (Online) V ol.6, No.15, 2015 147 sample of the study, the mean identification of mal e students (Mean = 30.05, Standard Deviation 3.940) is higher than that of their female counterparts (Mean - 29.3 0, Standard Deviation = 3.334). But since the diffe rence is not statistically significant, we cannot generalise the result. Table 4: T-test Analysis of consumption practice of herbal medicine Gender N Mean S.D. T Df p-value Remark Male 30 26.93 - Not significant Table 4 presents the t-test comparison of the score s of male and female students with hearing impairme nt consumption practice of herbal medicine. The t-test comparison showed that the mean difference in cons umption practice of herbal medicine between male and female students with hearing impairment is not statistica lly significant (T-calculated -= 1.599, df = 48, P > 0. 05). We therefore accept the null hypothesis. It th erefore follows that from the sample of the study. The mean consumption practice of male students (Mean = 28.4 0. Standard Deviation = 3.202) is higher than that of their female counterparts (Mean = 26.93. Standard D eviation = 3.162). But since the difference is not statistic ally significant, we cannot generalise the result. Hypothesis Two: There is no significant influence o f religion on consumption practice among students with hearing impairment. Table 5: The relationship between Religion and Con sumption Practice (N = 50) Religion Consumption Practice Religion moment correlation (PPMC) nt was calculated for the relationship between reli gion and consumption practice among students with hearing im pairment. A weak negative correlation that was not significant at 0.05 level of probability (r = -0.03 5, p > 0.05). Therefore religion had a weak negativ e relationship which is not significant with consumption practice of herbal medicine among students with hearing impa irment. The non significant relationship implies that the i nfluence is not generalisable. 6. Discussion The result of research question 1 revealed that stu dents with hearing impairment perceived that many of the items of specimens of traditional medicinal plants used for the research were ordinary food. This demo nstrated that majority of the respondents did not know that the specimens are good as medicine and food. The ou tcome is suggestive that there is poor awareness of this tra ditional/alternative therapy among the hearing impa ired. This is contrary to what happens in the western world as bo th people with and without disabilities are well in formed of the latest in their environment. For instance, Stei n (2004) noted that in developed countries such as United States, majority of people (55%) combine alternativ e treatment with conventional medicine. The outcome of research question 1 was contrary to WHO submission that about 80% of the world people depend on tradit ional medicine for primary health care needs as reported by (Azaizeh, et al., 2003). Research question 2 revealed that the participants used (students with hearing impairment) have low kn owledge of the alternative medicine. Obviously, students wi th hearing impairment are familiar with those medic inal plants common in their environment however, the kno wledge that they can serve as medicine to cure some common ailment was very poor. Of concern to people with hearing impairment in Nigeria is the poor know ledge of some benefiting information. Though this group o f people had been active consumer of these local pl ants at whatever rate and measurement which sometimes would have been detrimental to their health or improve t heir health status but lack of knowledge of their uses i s not good when it comes to using traditional medic ine as complementary to orthodox. For instance, Seidman an d Babu (2003) reported that there is growing shift to alternative forms of therapy as many patients are s howing dissatisfaction with conventional medical ca re because of serious side effects of many orthodox medication s. Polarito (2012) also reported a number of nutrie nt supplement derived from medicinal plants are being studied and applied to mitigate cellular and molecu lar Journal of Education and Practice www.iiste.org ISSN 2222-1735 (Paper) ISSN 2222-288X (Online) V ol.6, No.15, 2015 148 damage that leads to hearing loss. Hence, having th e knowledge of the usefulness of some medicinal pla nts could be advantageous for individuals with and without di sabilities. The result of hypothesis 1 revealed no significant difference in the identification and consumption pr actices of herbal medicine among male and female students with hearing impairment that participated in the study. This is so because two groups are affected with similar con dition. They are virtually cut away from the langua ge rich environment which make vital information of what ha ppens around them elusive. This lack of information affects all domains of their lives. The impact of t his lack of information is of the major reasons why children with hearing impairment were disproportionately des cribed as underachiever as described Oyler, et al ( 1987) and cited by Kippler, et al -(2013). The result of hypothesis 2 revealed that there is n o significant influence of religion on consumption practice among students with hearing impairment. The Pearson product moment correlation revealed weak relations hip which is indication that whatever religion the part icipant practice, it has not demonstrated any serio us influence on them. Therefore, the major influence is educatio n and information which will help them to know the benefit of these medicinal plants which ordinarily they con sume as common food. 7. Conclusion The growing trend in health care delivery is the us e of traditional medicine as alternative or complem entary interactive approach to treat variety of health rel ated challenges. In rural and sub-urban area, tradi tional medicine has remained the most affordable and accessible sou rce of treatments which makes the survey of knowled ge, perception and consumption practices among people w ith hearing impairment necessary. The outcome of th e study revealed that this group of people demonstrat ed negative perception and poor knowledge toward th is complementary approach to conventional medicine. Th is therefore should serve as an eye opener to all stakeholders in the field of education and caregive rs of people with hearing difficulty that there is still a lot to be done in order to make society develop holistically in all areas of our lives. 8. Recommendations In view of the outcome of this study, it is therefo re recommended that: awareness should be created among students with hea ring impairment on the new trend of healthcare delivery which employs traditional medicine derived from plants common in our communities; proper education should be given to students with h earing impairment about traditional medicine which is now alternative or complementary in approach for treating some common ailment and life threatening diseases; traditional medicine and medicinal plants study sho uld be introduced into the curriculum right from primary school to acquaint school age children with identification and usage of these plants; and more advocacy should be done by government, non-gov ernmental organisations and individuals to make society realise the plight of people with disa bilities generally.
