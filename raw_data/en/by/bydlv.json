Cardiff, the Welsh capital, is the first city outside of London to use this technology, following a study published in April that claims Cardiff drivers spend on average 11 minutes finding a space to park, which is longer than in any other major UK city. The technology works by sending an infra-red signal from a sensor recessed in the road. If the beam bounces back because a car is parked, the data is picked up by another sensor mounted on a nearby lamppost. All of the data is relayed to a central server that updates an online app in real time, showing parking spaces as being full or empty.The council said that if the pilot areas, across a number of locations in and around the centre of Cardiff, are successful, it would look at extending the scheme. It is hoped the system will cut down on both congestion and carbon emissions. www.smartparking.comAirbus finalises $26.6bn plane deal with Indian airline IndiGo European aerospace group confirms its single-largest order with the sale of 250 A320neo planes, the wings of which will be made at North Wales plant The wings for the Airbus A320 planes will be made at Broughton in North Wales, before being sent on to aircraft production lines in Hamburg, Toulouse or China.

Glacial earthquakes have increased seven-fold in the last two decades and have been migrating north, suggesting an increase in rates of mass loss from the ice sheet through calving. This new insight into glacier behaviour should enable scientists to measure glacier calving remotely and will improve the reliability of models that predict future sea-level rises in a warming climate. Researchers from Swansea, Newcastle and Sheffield Universities installed a robust wireless network of Global Positioning System (GPS) devices on the chaotic surface of Helheim, one of the largest glaciers in south-east Greenland, in order to measure velocity and displacement of the glacier surface. Backward-moving glacier helps scientists explain glacial earthquakes With US collaborators from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the University of Michigan and Emory University, earthquake data from the Global Seismographic Network and scaled-down models in water tanks were used to explain the unexpected movements of the glacier in the minutes surrounding the calving events. Understanding this glacier behaviour and the associated glacial earthquakes is a crucial step towards measuring calving events and their contribution to sea-level change. This tool has the potential to provide unprecedented, global and near real-time estimates of iceberg loss from the ice sheet. www.swansea.ac.ukwww.abm.wales.nhs.ukRadical plans for a \u00a3600m transformation of hospital services in south-west Wales have been revealed. The project, known as Arch, is a collaboration between Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, Hywel Dda University Health Board and Swansea University. Spanning six local authority areas and serving one million people, the project includes plans for Swansea's Morriston Hospital to double in size and become a regional centre for specialist treatments, with an acute hub to house the emergency department, acute GP unit, acute medical unit and a GP out-of-hours service covering Swansea and Neath Port Talbot.\"It breaks free from an outdated healthcare system designed more than 50 years ago and replaces it with an accessible one specifically planned for today's needs, in purpose-built or refurbished accommodation. \" Sian Harrop-Griffiths Director of Strategy ABMU Health Board The city's other hospital, Singleton, would be a centre of excellence for a broad range of diagnostic, rehabilitation and treatment services - including both urgent and planned care.

The new CHERISH-DE Centre - or Challenging Human Environments and Research Impact for a Sustainable and Healthy Digital Economy - has received a Government funding boost through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), with further investment from industrial and research partners. Led by Professor Matt Jones, head of the College of Science, the centre will explore how to deliver digital innovations that help people relate and respond to the rapidly expanding technological world, with a focus on health and social care, resource-constrained communities, heritage, and cybersecurity and cyberterrorism. \"From this trial we expect to gain a significant understanding of how self-healing capabilities can be incorporated into concrete structures and how these structures will perform within real life conditions. As the first trial of its kind, it demonstrates how Costain and the Materials for Life team are bringing state of the art innovation into UK infrastructure\". Oliver T eall Costain Civil Engineer and PhD student \"This investment, in excess of \u00a37M, will ensure that Swansea's strengths can be mobilised to help position the UK as a world leader in digital economy innovation. \" Professor Richard B Davies Vice-Chancellor Swansea UniversityA section of the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales will, this September, host the UK's first ever trial of a self-healing concrete structure. The principal contractor for the scheme, Costain, will be hosting the trial, and the material is being developed through the Materials for Life research project. The research, funded by EPSRC, is led by Cardiff University who, along with Bath and Cambridge Universities, have been carrying out laboratory tests on self-healing concrete for the past two years. As explained in a feature article of Advances issue 70, self-healing concrete makes use of shape memory polymers, microcapsules, microorganisms and flow networks to heal its own cracks. Since then, the university researchers have up-scaled their experiments and combined the techniques in different ways to maximise the healing efficiency of the concrete. The ultimate aim is to develop more environmentally sustainable concrete structures with reduced whole life costs. The trial will involve the construction of several full-scale concrete panels, which will be artificially damaged and monitored while exposed to outdoor conditions. www.swansea.ac.ukThe project will combine the expertise of researchers from social science, computer science, economics, medicine, arts and humanities, and law. The project's major partners include the BBC, the DVLA, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU), Microsoft, IBM and, critically for the economy, a broad and deep network of small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs). These include Leadin, a Finnish company attracted to Swansea by the opportunities of growing the regional technolgy cluster. 7 advances advances advances walesNEWS NEWS7 Issue 77/Autumn 2015Fossil forest gets national recognition and protection A fossil forest in Brymbo, near Wrexham, which pre-dates dinosaurs, has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by Natural Resources Wales. Covering an area nearly half the size of a football pitch, the site contains a variety of 300 million year old fossilised plants and trees. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) says it is a world-class site for plant fossils. The fossils were first revealed in 2004 on the former iron and steel works site in Brymbo. They are the In August 2015, following an exhaustive decade of research and testing on three full-scale prototypes, the first commercial lagoon using Wavegarden\u00ae technology has opened its door to the public. Located in the lee of the Snowdonia mountains next to the village of Dolgarrog, Surf Snowdonia has transformed a derelict aluminium works into an innovative surf facility. The surfing lagoon measures 300 metres by 120 metres, equivalent in size to three football pitches long and two wide. The \u00a312m facility provides the World-first Wavegarden\u00ae opens in Surf Snowdonia, North Wales opportunity for visitors to ride ocean-like waves tailored for surfers of all ability levels. Perfect waves ranging between 0.7m and 2m high, with a lengthy surfing experience of 16 seconds per wave, are consistently generated in a safe and natural environment. The facility produces waves by pulling a hydraulic snowplough-like wedge along under the water. The wedge travels 180m in 19 seconds under a central pier, before being sent back the other way, to produce waves in opposite directions. Transforming the derelict site into the new facility involved the removal of eighteen tanker-loads of heavy metals and hydrocarbons. Around 25,000 remains of plants that grew in hot, humid conditions near the equator - and include 20 fossilised giant clubmosses, which look like massive tree stumps. Plans to establish an excavation and visitor centre on the site are being led by Brymbo Heritage Group, who will ensure the right conditions are set up to study and display these fragile fossils. Some of the best and rarest fossils have been removed and are being conserved in the National Museum of Wales. They will be returned to Brymbo for public display, once a suitable building is ready.www.surfsnowdonia.co.uk www.nationalresources.walescubic metres of other materials were removed from the old foundations, crushed and re-used. The new facility is estimated to create over 60 direct jobs, and sustain around 100 other jobs in the supply chain. The owners are expecting in excess of 75,000 visitors per year. It is illegal to remove fossils or damage a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\"This joint venture with Cardiff University is a key step in creating the world's first compound semiconductor cluster, spanning the complete technology readiness level scale from basic research to full scale production. Our goal is to build this cluster into one of global significance and scale, leading to widespread economic benefits for the region, and providing a broad range of compound semiconductor technologies to support the rapid growth of the key enabling technologies agendas, in Europe and throughout the rest of the world.

Fish, birds, mammals, insects and other invertebrates display different personalities. This means that they vary consistently in their behavioural responses, for example being bold or shy, but if animals show 'fixed' personalities, what happens when the environment changes? To answer part of this question, researchers from Swansea University have been exploring the link between behaviour and physiology.Spineless personalities New research from Swansea University has revealed that individual differences in physiology are linked to risk-taking behaviour in marine shore crabs. ver the past decade, there has been growing interest in understanding 'animal personality', where individual animals consistently differ in their behaviour over time and contexts.OWhile vertebrate animal personalities are often underpinned by consistent individual differences in physiological traits, known as 'coping styles', whether this is also true for invertebrates has been unclear. The aim of the research from Dr Ines F\u00fcrtbauer and Swansea University's Department of Biosciences was to address this question in a marine invertebrate, the shore crab (Carcinus maenas). The research project explored individual differences in behaviour and physiology of shore crabs, measuring the crabs' consistency in behaviour by filming them in a test tank. From the video footage, Dr F\u00fcrtbauer was able to extract the extent of exploration of the environment in the tank, how much time was spent immobile, and how much time was spent near shelter. The time spent near shelter was indicative of risk-taking behaviour, i.e. if an individual hides more it is assumed to be more risk averse. The crabs showed consistent individual differences in exploration, time spent immobile, and time spent near shelter. In addition to this work, Dr F\u00fcrtbauer collected haemolymph (which is analogous to blood in vertebrates) and measured its density on a weekly basis. Crab haemolymph density was highly consistent across six weeks. This indicates that individuals vary consistently in their physiology. Furthermore, haemolymph density was linked to the crabs' risk propensity, meaning that crabs with higher haemolymph density spent more time hiding near shelter. This research provides the first evidence of 'coping styles' in an invertebrate. The next step for the researchers is to investigate the sources of individual variation in haemolymph density to discover which proteins underlie the variation.'Coping styles', are correlated suites of behaviour and physiology, and provide a useful concept for understanding how individuals deal with changes in the environment. For example, in many vertebrates, we find reactive and proactive coping styles. Reactive individuals can be characterised by high physiological stress and immobility. Proactive individuals, in contrast, can be characterised by low physiological stress and high locomotor activity. advances advances advances walesBIOTECHNOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY 10Spineless personalities \"Both metabolism and immunology have been linked to variation in personality in vertebrates but can be difficult to study. Invertebrates, in general, provide several advantages over vertebrates and, together with my findings, offer great potential for studying the physiological underpinnings of animal personality. \" Dr F\u00fcrtbauer Department of Biosciences Swansea UniversityIn crustaceans, haemolymph density is directly proportional to blood protein concentrations, meaning that the more proteins in the blood, the higher its density. Haemolymph protein concentrations are often used as an indicator of physiological condition.In crustaceans, 70-95% of total haemolymph protein is haemocyanin, the oxygen transport molecule in crustaceans and many other invertebrates. The remaining proteins include various antimicrobials, such as proteins associated with immune defence, suggesting a link between the crabs' personality and their metabolism and immunology.

The team takes advantage of an insight known as the Cotton Mouton magneto-optic effect, discovered by French scientists - Messrs. Cotton and Mouton - at the turn of the 20th century, allowing them to develop an innovative healthcare tool that can be used for the diagnosis of sepsis and malaria. The CMD tool works by creating a 'lighthouse' effect.

Bthe same direction. If the field is then rotated, the particles rotate with it. The Cotton Mouton effect occurs when light is passed through this cloud of rotating particles creating a 'lighthouse' effect, as it only passes through the cloud of particles when they are facing in the same direction as the light source. When the particles are pointing perpendicular to the light source, the light is obscured. When conducted on a nano scale, with tiny rods suspended in a blood sample from a patient, certain proteins from the blood bind to the sides of these rods, slowing down their rotation. This in turn affects the rate at which the light shines through the sample. By measuring the light that shines through when these rods are in a blood sample, the identification and diagnosis of sepsis can take place. Although the team's initial focus is on sepsis, the platform nature of this technology means that it is broadly applicable across a range of sectors. The team at CMD is looking to explore opportunities with collaborative partners to deliver solutions to sectors outside of healthcare over the next 18 months.\"Supported by Innovate UK funding, we are now transforming our innovative malaria diagnostic system into an exciting, multi-analyte sensing platform.

Professor Les Baillie from Cardiff University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences led the microbiology aspects of the project. For thousands of years, honey has been used to treat sore throats, wounds and infections, due to compounds present in the honey that kill bacteria. These properties are the result of a range of factors including the phytochemicals donated by the plants. The contribution of these phytochemicals to the overall antibacterial activity of a particular honey depends on the properties of the plants visited by the bees. For example, Manuka honey from New Zealand is produced when bees forage on the Manuka bush (Leptospermum scoparium), a plant that produces a compound with potent antibacterial properties. The search to identify other antibacterial phytochemicals has led to the screening of honey produced by bees that have fed on plants from a variety of UK habitats. \"Our plan was to employ bees as private investigators and to send them out to interview every flowering plant in the country. During each visit, they collect a forensic material in the form of nectar containing phytochemicals - some of which may be antibacterial - and pollen which holds the DNA fingerprint of the plant,\" Dr Hawkins explained.cientists from Cardiff University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences and the National Botanic Garden of Wales have been working together to identify plant-derived drugs which could be used to treat antibiotic resistant hospital pathogens. Numerous species of bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics over the past few decades, so there is an increasing need to prevent and control the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistance in hospitals. Dr Hawkins and the team took the antibacterial analysis of 250 samples of honey and DNA barcoded 20 of these. They were successful in using bees as a natural drug discovery tool. Compounds were present in honey found in the back garden of a beekeeper from Tywyn in Gwynedd that can kill microorganisms and combat MRSA. By breaking the DNA code, the team could find out which plants the bees are using to create the honey. The top 20 plants in antibacterial honey have been identified, along with other novel drugs that are currently in the process of analysis. Using the knowledge from this project, it is possible to create a special honey by leading bees to plants with strong antibacterial elements. Dr Baillie and his team are now trying to put these plants in as many places as possible for the bees to feed upon. They plan to use a grass meadow on the rooftop of St David's 2 shopping centre in Cardiff, where they can place beehives, to see if bees will produce honey with antibacterial properties. They are also engaging with the community in Grangetown in Cardiff and hope to find a new use for a disused bowling green by creating a new habitat for bees there, too. advances advances advances walesMEDICINE MEDICINE 14 15Profile Product Antibacterial properties in plants and honey Applications Development of novel and natural antibiotics Contact Professor Les BaillieProfessor in MicrobiologySchool of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences College of Biomedical and Life Sciences Cardiff UniversityRedwood BuildingKing Edward VII University's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences worked with Julian Rees from Pollen8 Cymru to expand the reach of the project, and organised a large science exhibition in the Science and Technology Pavilion at the 2014 National Eisteddfod of Wales in Llanelli.

They hope their work will lead to the development of new tests to show the status of AKI in patients, so doctors can monitor them accordingly. AKI can occur as a result of an operation, infection or severe illness inducing 'shock' to the kidneys, causing them to suddenly stop working properly. With the potential to become a life-threatening problem within hours, early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial. The severity of the condition can range from minor loss of kidney function to complete kidney failure, and 50-60% of people who develop the condition die as a result. This figure has not changed in the last four decades. Existing tests for AKI include monitoring a patient's urine output and measuring the amount of toxins building up in their blood stream as a result of kidney failure. Both show that the kidneys are not working properly but will not indicate a problem immediately. However, a newly discovered group of molecules called microRNAs could help to predict the progression of AKI with a much faster test. MicroRNAs constitute a class of non-coding RNAs that play key roles in the regulation of gene expression. Previous data have shown that the levels of these molecules change in AKI, and the team will investigate this further. During the study the team will collect urine samples from patients with AKI and evaluate the ability of microRNA levels to predict what subsequently happens to that individual. Different levels of microRNAs could indicate how likely a patient is to recover from the condition, or how likely it is that their condition will deteriorate.cientists at Cardiff University in South Wales are investigating whether the urine of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) could give previously hidden clues to how their condition will progress, and show how likely they are to recover from their illness.

The study found that a biomarker of clot microstructure and clot formation was the only way to identify a significant difference between patients with or without VTE. The 'abnormal' clot microstructures in the VTE patients suggest either the presence of a procoagulant state that has not been detected by other markers, or an inadequate response to anticoagulant therapy. Furthermore, elevated values of the biomarker were found in first time patients who later developed a secondary event, indicating that this biomarker may identify those at risk of recurrence. team at the Haemostasis Biomedical Research Unit (HBRU) at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, South Wales, has developed new biomarkers of clot microstructure, which show promising results in terms of diagnosing and monitoring disease and treatment.

When testing how effective the smell or perfume function was as an insect repellent, the team found that the smells repelled insects in all but one case. In this case a reversal of behaviour - an attractant - was observed, which may be harnessed to develop a trap-and-kill device in the future. Until now, progress in recreating smells has been extremely slow due to the volatile and chemically unstable nature of smell molecules. A breakthrough in the rational design of smells, this study offers an innovative way to recreate scent by using a novel technique to produce smells with different and potentially superior properties to the original. \"By using alternative substrates for the enzymes involved in the ligand biosynthesis (biosynthesis of the smell) we can create the appropriate chemical space to reproduce, with a different molecular structure, the activity of the original smell,\" said Professor John Pickett, FRS, Rothamsted Research.

An area of particular importance and concern with many behavioural addictions is the relationship between excessive engagement in an activity and high levels of impulsive behaviour, which has also been suggested as a potential concern in relation to IAD. Professor Phil Reed from Swansea University collaborated with Professor Roberto Truzoli and Michela Romano from the University of Milan, and Dr Lisa A. Osborne from ABMU in a study to explore the impact of Internet exposure on the impulsivity of individuals who reported high or low levels of problematic Internet behaviours. During the study, levels of problematic Internet use in 60 individuals, with an average age of 24, were measured using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). esearchers at Swansea, Milan and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU)have conducted research revealing that individuals demonstrating a problematic use of the Internet become more impulsive after exposure. Patterns of behaviour described as 'impulsive' are associated with deficits in decision-making, and can be associated with problematic behaviours, such as gambling.likelihood of making 'impulsive choices', and reducing their 'self-controlled' choices. This is the first time that research data has shown, experimentally, the changes in behaviour choice as a result of exposure to the Internet. The key finding, that exposure to the Internet induced those with higher levels of problematic Internet use to display greater levels of impulsivity, not only establishes a link between IAD and other behavioural addictions, but also has implications for the understanding of the subsequent development of other IAD-related behaviours as a clinical phenomenon. The behavioural acts that are encompassed by IAD, such as increasing amounts of exposure to the Internet over time, may also serve to increase the likelihood of further impulsive behaviours which, in turn, have been shown to predict further Internet usage, producing a 'circle of addiction' to the Internet. In recent years, the Internet has dramatically altered the world largely for the better. However, this study raises awareness of the possible dangers of using such a powerful tool carelessly. Participants were exposed to a choice assessment, in which they could choose between a small immediately delivered outcome (impulsive), a medium-sized outcome with a medium delay (optimal), and a larger longer-delayed outcome (self- controlled). They were given 15 minutes access to the Internet, during which most participants chose to visit social media sites. They were then presented with the choice test again. After Internet exposure, higher-problem users displayed greater impulsivity than before they used the Internet, indicated by a move from self-controlled to impulsive choices, suggesting that individuals reporting Internet-related problems become more impulsive after exposure to the Internet.

Headed by Professor Nigel Copner, Chair of Optoelectronics, its core competence is the use of semi- conductor light sources in the fields of life science, digital media, telecommunications and metrology. Transmitting digital information to homes and offices involves a complex package of advanced technologies. Increasing demands on the global delivery of high-performance network- based applications, such as cloud computing and high definition video-on-demand, means meeting the requirements for bandwidth is a continual challenge for industry. Profile Product All-Optical Wavelength Conversion Applications Transmitting digital communication Contact Dr Yongkang Gong LecturerWireless and Optoelectronics Research and Innovation Centre (WORIC)Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Science University of South Wales, J Block Laser in the delivery of digital information is optical fibre, which enables information to travel over longer distances at lower cost and higher bandwidth. Sending information over long distances is usually straightforward. However, when the optical fibre reaches the edge of a city, network operators need to separate and route the information to numerous locations within the metropolitan network. Although a message may be transmitted on a long-haul fibre at one wavelength, the metro network needs to use different wavelengths to route data to the right address. Wavelength conversion is achieved by converting an optical signal to an electronic signal (O/E), and then back to an optical signal (E/O), before re-transmitting it on a new wavelength. This approach suffers from high power consumption and creates an 'electronic bottleneck' in high-speed networks. Due to the critical need to develop the next generation of all-optical networks with higher capacity and more powerful signal processing capability, researchers at WORIC have worked to create a solution. The new developments will enable the key functionality required for delivery of high-performance network-based applications and support next generation all-optical networks, representing a 'step change' for the telecommunications industry and its users. Based on a novel physical effect, this new phenomenon, named \"spoof four-wave fixing\", was discovered and theoretically and experimentally verified by researchers at WORIC. The benefits of the technology are that it can provide format-transparency and high-speed broadband range wavelength conversion without the need for conversion into an electronic signal. This will allow for better efficiencies and services for internet users. The technology can be used for telecommunications and other applications where dynamic wavelength tunability is essential, such as high-performance network-based applications. It can also be used for next generation all-optical networks, and for spectroscopy, metrology and sensing. The team is currently seeking more cooperation and funding to refine this technology to meet industry requirements. \"This proposed technology is based on modulating a nonlinear grating with a dynamic grating induced by pump and signal lasers. It does not require phase matching and thus allows broader range wavelength conversion than existing technology based on four-wave mixing. \" Dr Yongkang Gong Wireless and Optoelectronics Research and Innovation Centre (WORIC) University of South Wales advances advances advances walesOPTO-ELECTRONICS OPTO-ELECTRONICS 2424SPowered by nature Greenscreen - The self-cleaning screen that requires no electrical power amatrix, a wastewater management company based in Swansea, has developed an innovative water pumping system that cleans itself during an emergency event without the requirement of electrical power. With no running costs and a low carbon footprint, the Greenscreen offers a maintenance free operation. Usually during an emergency spill event, such as exceptionally heavy rainfall or an electrical power failure, overflow screens prevent solids or rags going into watercourses. The current static screens will achieve their objective, but must be manually cleaned once they have become blocked. The Greenscreen idea arose when Samatrix was called to several sites to investigate why rags were flowing into the river. Upon investigating these pumping stations, it was noted that the screens were blocked; causing an overspill that carried the rags with it. As a solution, the Greenscreen was developed with a screen face that is swept clean as soon as the open area of the screen is significantly reduced. The outflow is then restored to its maximum. This is repeated every time the screen becomes clogged until the end of the event; when the screen will give itself one final clean in preparation for the next time it is required.

Requiring no electrical connection, the system has a low carbon footprint compared to an electrically powered screen. Samatrix plans to develop a range of screens that are self-powered to operate in a number of different applications. They plan to open a new facility in Wales to develop and manufacture the equipment in the future.\"Greenscreen is an innovative solution for all types of screened overflows. It has a low carbon manufacturing footprint and is powered by nature, making it the perfect choice for the environment and the cost-conscious alike. \" Samuel Munn Managing Director Samatrix Surfing the wavesadvances advances advances walesOPTO-ELECTRONICS OPTO-ELECTRONICS 25advances advances advances walesENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENT Issue 77/Autumn 2015EThe greener house effect UK's first 'smart' energy positive house xperts from Cardiff University in South Wales have designed and built the UK's first purpose-built, low-cost energy smart house, which is capable of exporting more energy to the national electricity grid than it uses. The house, designed by Professor Phil Jones and his team based at the Welsh School of Architecture, has been built as a prototype to meet tough new targets for zero-carbon housing set by UK Government. Designed and constructed as part of the Wales Low Carbon Research Institute's (LCRI) SOLCER project, and supported by SPECIFIC at Swansea University, its unique design combines, for the first time, reduced energy demand, renewable energy supply and energy storage to create an energy positive house.\"Buildings that can generate, store and release their own renewable energy could be a game-changer. The SOLCER House is intentionally built with the best off-the-shelf, affordable technologies, so it proves what's possible even now - and there's plenty more technology in the pipeline. \" Kevin Bygate Chief Executive SPECIFICProfessor Jones, who heads the SOLCER House project, explains, \"The UK Government, and governments across the world, have set future targets for achieving zero-carbon housing. This means that as an academic community we have to rise to that challenge and come up with innovative new ways to build houses of the future. Through this project, we have risen to this challenge and used the latest design and technology to build a smart energy positive house. This is the first house in the UK that has been purposely built, using a systems approach, to be carbon positive.\" Zero-carbon energy performance involves a combination of reduced energy demand and renewable energy supply, using the electricity grid to import and export energy. The design of the SOLCER House follows the 'Buildings as Power Stations' concept developed by the SPECIFIC Innovation and Knowledge Centre and is unique in that it uses a number of technologies and design approaches developed by the LCRI's Low Carbon Buildings Research Programme. In order to drastically reduce energy demands, the house was built with high levels of thermal insulation, reducing air leakage, and uses an innovative energy efficient design which includes low carbon cement, structural insulated panels (SIPS), external insulated render, transpired solar collectors and low emissivity double glazed aluminium clad timber frame windows and doors. The south-facing roof is comprised of glazed solar photovoltaic panels, fully integrated into the design of the building, allowing the roof space below to be naturally lit. This has been designed to reduce the cost of bolting on solar panels to a standard roof. The house's energy systems combine solar generation and battery storage to power its combined heating, ventilation, hot water system and its electrical power systems that include appliances, LED lighting and a heat pump. A 'Transpired Solar Collector' preheats the ventilation air, which is topped up from a thermal water store.advances advances advances walesENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENT 26Profile Product Energy positive house Applications Exporting more energy to the national electricity grid than it uses Contact Professor Phil JonesChair of Architectural Science Welsh School of Architecture Cardiff UniversityBute Building King Edward \"Now the house has been built, our key task is to ensure that all of the measures that we have put in place are monitored to maintain the most energy efficient use. We will use this information to inform future projects, with the aim that Wales remains at the heart of the development of a zero-carbon housing future. The building demonstrates our leading edge low carbon supply, storage and demand technologies at a domestic scale which Heating, ventilation and hot water: The house has mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR). Warm air from the transpired solar collector goes to the 450W heat pump in winter, where it preheats ventilation air. Heat from the exhaust air warms the domestic hot water supply.Key elements of the house: Foundations: Incorporate Cenin's low carbon cement to minimise embodied energy (the energy required to create the house).Structure/walls: Use of 194mm Structural insulated panels (SIPS) 150mm is standard. U-value (a measure of heat loss) is just 0.14 for these panels. External wall render minimises risk of thermal bridging and brings overall wall U-value to 0.13. The house also features BASF Neopor insulation material.Roof: The asymmetrical roof with a larger south-facing pitch, allowing for 40m 2 of photovoltaic panels integrated into clear glazing. The panels, made by GB-Sol which is based in nearby Pontypridd, provide 4.3kWp of energy. Batteries: The 20m2 north facing roof section houses 6 lightweight lithium ion batteries, from Victron Energy, with a total 6.9kW/hr capability. Transpired solar collector: The upper level of the south facing elevation incorporates a 17m2 transpired solar collector. A double metal skin, its outer layer having tiny perforations that allow heat from the sun to be captured in the cavity between the two layers. The warm air is then drawn into the ventilation system and distributed into the building. Appliances: All of the domestic appliances are A+ rated.Lighting: LED lighting is fitted throughout. Windows: The house uses aluminium clad timber windows incorporating Pilkington energiKare TM energy efficient ENER GY CONSTR UCTION In order to minimise the energy demand, the house was built with high levels of thermal insulation carbon cement, structural insulated panels (SIPS), external insulated rende r, transpired solar air collectors (TSC) and low emissivity double glazed aluminium clad timber frame windows and doors. The integrative approach to construction uses the renewable energy systems as south facing roof is the 4.3kWp PV panel system. This reduces costs and improves aesthetics, avoiding the 'bolt-on ' approach often associated with renewable energy systems. The aim of the design was to reduce the embodied energy in the building construction, as well as reducing the operating energy over its lifetime use.ENERGY POSITIVE The predicted energy performance is 70% autonomous, with a 1.75 grid export-to-input energy ratio. LOW COST Estimated cost of the house is \u00a31,000m2, compared with social housing benchmark of \u00a3800 - \u00a31,0000m2. LOW CARBONThe embodied CO 2 of the house materials is 340 kgCO2/m2, compared with standard house benchmark of around 500 kgCO2/m2.
