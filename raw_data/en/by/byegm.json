If fed too slowly (over too much time), hydrolysis degradate can form in crystallizer feed. -Batch will contain some level of residual water (thermodynamics) -No rejection of hydrolysis degradate seen in crystallization (prior knowledge/experience) Process Constraints -Factory process can control well within +/ - 10\u00baC. 70\u00baC is easily the worst case temperature -The batch must be held hot during the entire feed time (~ 10 hours), including time for batch heat up and time for operators to safely start up the crystallization. A total hold time of 24 hours at temperature is the worst case. \u00a9 ICH, November 2010 ICH Quality Implementation Working Group - Integrated Implementa tion Training Workshop slide 26Case Study Experimental Plan - Hydrolysis Degradation (contd.) Univariate experiments justified -Only upper end of ranges need to be tested, as first principles dictates this is worst case for degradation rate -Lower water content, temperature and hold times will not increase hydrolytic degradation -Upper end of range for batch temperature and hold time can be set based on capabilities of a typical factory -Therefore, only the water content of the batch needs to be varied to establish the design space Experimental Setup -Set maximum batch temperature (70\u00baC) -Set maximum batch feed time (include heat up time, hold time, etc.) = 24 hours -Vary residual water level -Monitor degradation rate with criteria for success = max 0.3% degradate (qualified limit)14 \u00a9 ICH, Q-IWG: Case study, Nov. 2010 \u00a9 ICH, November 2010 ICH Quality Implementation Working Group - Integrated Implementa tion Training Workshop slide 27Case Study Experimental Data Hydrolysis Degradation 0.00%0.10%0.20%0.30%0.40%0.50%0.60% 01 0 2 0 3 0 Time Degradate (LCAP)2.0% water 1.0% Max Temp: 70\u00baC Max Feed Time = 24 hrMax Water content = 1.0% At these conditions, degradate level remains below qualified limit of 0.3% 0.52% by KF titration) \u00a9 ICH, November 2010 ICH Quality Implementation Working Group - Integrated Implementa tion Training Workshop slide 28Case Study Particle Size Distribution Control - Process History Changes in formulation drive changes in API process Ph I and II trials performed with API-excipient mixture filled in hard gelatin capsules (liquid filled capsules = LFC) First API Deliveries -Simpler Crystallization Process -No PSD control; crystal agglomeration observed, but acceptable for LFC formulation Ph III trials performed with tablets, requiring small PSD for processing and dissolution 15 \u00a9 ICH, Q-IWG: Case study, Nov. 2010 \u00a9 ICH, November 2010 ICH Quality Implementation Working Group - Integrated Implementa tion Training Workshop slide 29Case Study Particle Size Distribution Control - Process History (contd.)
