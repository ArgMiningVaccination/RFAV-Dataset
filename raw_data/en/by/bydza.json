Rudnick, Jr., Thomas More College Because elder abuse victims, abusers, and stakeholders often seek help from trusted faith-based entities, clergy need to be adequately prepared with appropriate intervention responses, concept awareness and knowledge concerning elder abuse and neglect as an emerging health and social crisis (University of Kentucky, 2007). This presentation is based on a study that explored issues related to the general research question: \"What is the perceived level of elder abuse and neglect awareness, knowledge and intervention preferences among Protestant clergy in Kentucky? Survey responses were paired to examine relationships between demographic characteristics and the facets measured--awareness, knowledge intervention preferences, and perceived severity of elder abuse and neglect. Overall, clergy were generally not aware of their responsibilities and lacked detailed knowledge about elder abuse and neglect. Recommended areas for future research linked to awareness, knowledge, intervention responses and perceived severity are provided.
