Your tissues, cells and organs work together to identify \"invaders,\" or antigens \u2014 substances that don't belong in your body, such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, chemicals or allergens \u2014 and your immune system responds by creating antibodies and cells that attack, weaken or destroy these antigens. Continue reading to learn how you can enhance and strengthen your immune system as part of a [healthier lifestyle](https://www.carecredit.com/well-u/health-wellness/healthy-lifestyle-makeover/). 1. Eat a Healthy, Balanced Diet Support your immune system with the [nutrients](https://www.carecredit.com/well-u/health-wellness/nutrition-tips/) it needs for optimal function by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, whole grains and low-fat milk products. Limit saturated fats, cholesterol, salt and refined sugar.1 Consider these key nutrients found in a variety of familiar foods: - Beta-carotene is an antioxidant that the body converts to vitamin A, which is necessary for healthy skin, eye health and mucous membranes. Carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, cantaloupe, tomatoes, bell peppers and squash are rich sources of beta-carotene.2 - Vitamin C is necessary for collagen synthesis, a key component of connective tissue that plays a role in wound healing. Citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruit, kiwifruit, as well as berries and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and brussels sprouts are excellent sources of vitamin C.3 - Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is critical to maintaining healthy bones. Salmon, swordfish, tuna, liver and egg yolks are natural sources of vitamin D, while dairy and plant milks or cereals fortified with vitamin D are also excellent sources.4 - Zinc is a trace mineral that plays a large role in creating DNA, cell growth, healing tissue damage and building proteins. Shellfish, beef, poultry, pork, legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains are good sources of zinc.5 Healthy eating on a budget takes a little planning, but consider these strategies the next time you head to the grocery store for ways to save:6 - Only buy fresh foods in quantities you know will be eaten within one week to help prevent food waste. - Look for frozen fruits and vegetables, which have the same nutritional value as fresh produce but are less perishable. - Buy produce that's in season for the best taste, as well as cost savings. - Avoid preportioned snack packs. Though convenient, these items often have added salt, sugar and fat. Instead, buy fresh produce, seeds, nuts or dried fruits and preportion them yourself. 2. Exercise Regularly It's no surprise that experts recommend regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for short- and long-term health benefits. Regular exercise can improve sleep, reduce anxiety and [lower blood pressure](https://www.carecredit.com/well-u/health-wellness/ways-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/).7 Consistent physical activity also plays a role in reducing the risk of developing chronic diseases such as dementia, depression, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. In addition, regular exercise has been shown to lower the risk of certain types of cancers, including breast, bladder, colon, lung, stomach and kidney.7 The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) (CDC) recommends that most adults between the ages of 18 to 64 get 150 minutes of moderate activity per week and two days per week of activities that strengthen muscles. The CDC recommends the same amount of activity for adults over 65, in addition to activities that improve balance, like standing on one foot.8 You don't need a gym membership or expensive equipment to move your body. A brisk 30-minute walk, biking, jogging, swimming or light hiking five days a week will get your blood pumping. Simple strength-training routines that use your own body weight (think squats, lunges and push-ups) can be found online and modified for your fitness level. 3. Get Enough Sleep The right amount of quality sleep is essential to maintaining a healthy immune system. The rapid eye movement (REM) cycle of sleep is particularly restorative, as the body uses this period to repair cells, remove toxins and destress. Some research suggests that chronically disrupted sleep contributes to increased memory loss, instances of mood disorders and possibly higher rates of heart disease and cancer.9 Most adults should aim for seven to nine hours of sleep each night, while children may need eight to 14 hours, depending on age.9 Create good sleep habits by avoiding alcohol, caffeine and screens before bedtime. Aim to get to bed and rise at approximately the same time every day, including weekends.9 Optimize the conditions for restful sleep, making adjustments to the light and temperature of your bedroom as needed. Use a humidifier daily if the air where you sleep is particularly dry to help keep nasal passages in good condition. 4. Manage Stress The mind-body connection has long been researched and documented to demonstrate how chronic stress can have a negative effect on your body's immune system. Cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by your adrenal glands that helps the body regulate stress and suppress inflammation, manage blood sugar and blood pressure and helps your body's metabolism run efficiently. Chronic, unmanaged stress can lead to repetitive cycles of elevated levels of cortisol flooding the body and disrupting normal function.10 [Actively managing stress](https://www.carecredit.com/well-u/health-wellness/how-to-relieve-stress/) is essential to maintaining a healthy immune system, and finding the right activities to reduce your stress is key; activities that lower stress for some people may actually increase it for others. Stress-reducing activities may include the routine practice of meditation, mindful breathing, journaling, exercise, yoga or tai-chi. Making time for hobbies or other interests can reduce stress, as can maintaining social connections with family and friends. Pets can be wonderful stress reducers for some people, and time spent with a four-legged friend has been shown to lower stress reactions for many people.11 5. Stay Hydrated Dehydration can negatively impact your overall health, as it can cause headaches and mood swings; affect kidney, liver and heart functions; and impair your digestion and ability to focus.12 Generally, most adults should hydrate enough daily so that their urine is pale yellow, drinking when they feel thirsty and stopping when they feel their thirst has been quenched. Pay attention to thirst signals and replenish fluids if exercising or outside in a hot climate. Older adults may need to sip water more frequently throughout the day to stay hydrated, even if they're not feeling thirsty, as the body's thirst signals are often diminished for many of us as we age.12 Water is a great option for hydrating, as it's calorie-free and readily available. If you find plain water too boring, try boosting the flavor with fresh slices of lemon, lime, berries, cucumbers or herbs. Herbal teas enhanced with lemon or ginger, and fruits and vegetables with high water content (such as melons) can also be hydrating, but be careful of fruit juices and sweetened teas, as the sugar content can be high.12 6. Use Supplements for Extra Support A balanced diet provides the vitamins and nutrients needed for a healthy immune system, but for those with dietary restrictions or other health challenges, additional supplements may help address vitamin deficiencies. Talk with your doctor about testing first to determine if you have a vitamin deficiency that can be addressed with supplements. Vitamins essential for a healthy immune system include vitamins C and D as well as zinc, as outlined above. In addition, supplements for folic acid, iron and vitamins A and E are commonly prescribed to address deficiencies.13 If your doctor has given their approval to add supplements to your diet, you have money-saving options available to keep costs budget-friendly:13 - Choose a multivitamin that can replace taking individual supplements. - Shop online with big box stores or vitamin retailers for the best prices and shipping options. Participating in a vitamin subscription program often yields the most affordable pricing. - If your doctor has written a prescription for a particular supplement \u2014 for example, a vitamin D megadose \u2014 check to see if your health insurance covers it. - Investigate the generic options available. - Buy vitamins in bulk for optimal savings. With proper storage, most vitamins have a relatively long shelf life. 7. Maintain a Healthy Weight Carrying excess weight creates added stress on the body and can impair its immune functions, potentially reducing the effectiveness of a number of vaccines, including those for tetanus, influenza and hepatitis B.1 Effective weight management often encompasses more than diet and exercise. While a healthy diet and regular exercise are important for weight loss, so too are combining the habits mentioned above, including managing stress, getting enough sleep and staying hydrated.1 Read Related: [Average Cost of Common Weight Loss Programs and Procedures](https://www.carecredit.com/well-u/health-wellness/weight-loss-program-average-cost/) 8. Eliminate Tobacco and Limit Alcohol There's no question that quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your overall health that might save your life. While lung cancer is the top cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. among both men and women, those with lung disease are also more prone to respiratory infections, COVID-19, influenza and chronic conditions like asthma and COPD.9 If you've tried quitting in the past, you're not alone \u2014 the average smoker tries to quit six times before finding success. Talk to your doctor about smoking cessation programs, including therapies or medications that could increase your chance of quitting successfully by 40%.9 Likewise, chronic intake of excessive alcohol also puts your immune system at risk, making it less able to combat inflammation and infection and deteriorating the intestinal microbiome's ability to fight disease. Current guidelines for adults suggest drinking in moderation, which equates to two drinks or less per day for men and one drink or less per day for women.14 9. Practice Good Hygiene Studies have shown time and again that practicing good personal hygiene habits is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and others from spreading infectious diseases like cold, flu, staph infections and COVID-19.15 Simple hygiene habits you can practice include frequent handwashing; covering your nose and mouth with a tissue or the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze; disinfecting door knobs, countertops and other high-touch items like mobile phones and keys; and opening windows to encourage the flow of fresh air.15 Wash your hands: - After using the bathroom - Before and after preparing food - After changing diapers or cleaning up other bodily fluids - After handling animals, pets or pet feces - After blowing your nose, sneezing or coughing into your hands - Before and after dressing a wound - After touching trash or other dirty surfaces Proper handwashing technique includes:15 - Wetting your hands with warm water - Covering all surfaces, including between the fingers, with soap - Washing your hands for at least 20 seconds (or sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice) - Using a nail brush if possible - Rinsing with clean water 10. Stay Up to Date on Vaccinations Only about 1 in 5 U.S. adults is up to date on their vaccines, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable illnesses, disease, hospitalizations and even death.16 Talk with your doctor about which vaccines are recommended for you. In addition to an annual influenza vaccine, you may need vaccine updates to prevent tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis A and B, shingles, pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease and human papillomavirus.16 In the U.S., private health insurance providers as well as all Health Insurance Marketplace plans must cover certain vaccines without charging a copay or coinsurance when the vaccines are provided by an in-network provider.17 In addition, certain vaccines are covered under Medicare, Medicaid and military health insurance under TRICARE. Most U.S. states offer low or no-cost vaccine programs \u2014 check with your state for eligibility requirements and availability.17 Building and maintaining a strong immune system is not a one-size-fits-all process, but a series of holistic habits that include a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep, managing stress, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol, eliminating smoking and staying up to date on your recommended vaccinations. You can start making small changes to strengthen your immune system today to increase your likelihood of better health outcomes in the future.
