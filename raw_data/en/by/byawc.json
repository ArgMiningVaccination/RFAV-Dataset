However, the severity of the procedure varies. Some of these procedures involve only the removal of the prepuce, a fold of skin surrounding the clitoris that is often referred to as the clitoral hood. Others may involve the removal of the clitoris, labia minora, the inner skin folds of the vulva, or labia majora, the outer skin folds of the vulva. The specific procedure performed can vary depending on cultural practices and geographical regions. The table below identifies the first three types of female genital mutilation based on which parts of a ||untouched ||untouched | |II (Excision) ||may be partially or totally removed ||may be partially or totally removed ||removed ||may be removed | |III (Infibulation) ||may be partially or totally removed ||may be partially or totally removed ||removed or sewed together ||removed or sewed together | Infibulation is the most severe form of FGM, which involves narrowing the vaginal opening, often along with removing the clitoris, by stitching together the labia majora or labia minora. This vaginal opening is later deinfibulated through sexual intercourse or cutting to facilitate sex or childbirth. Type IV, the last category of female genital mutilation, encompasses all other harmful procedures performed on female genitalia for non-medical purposes. This includes practices such as pricking, piercing, cauterization, scraping, or any other form of genital alteration that do not fall under the previous three types. Medical Clitorectomy In addition to the harmful cultural practices of female genital mutilation, medical professionals may consider or perform clitoridectomies in cases of health issues or abnormalities. For example: - Clitoral Malignancy: Clitoral cancer is a rare cancer affecting the clitoris. In cases where the cancer is localized and has not spread to other tissues, surgical removal of the clitoris may be necessary for cancer treatment. - Severe Clitoral or Labial Trauma: In cases of severe trauma or injury to the clitoris or labia, surgical intervention may be required. This could involve partial or total removal of the clitoris as part of the reconstructive or repair procedure. - Intersex Conditions: Intersexuality refers to various conditions where an individual's physical sex characteristics do not align with typical male or female anatomy. In some cases, where there are significant concerns about the health or well-being of the individual, clitoridectomy may be considered as part of a broader surgical management plan. - Congenital Issues or Anomalies: Certain rare congenital abnormalities or developmental issues affecting the clitoris may require surgical intervention. In such cases, clitoridectomy may be performed as a part of a corrective procedure to address the specific concern. - Cosmetic Surgery: There are occasions where people have opted to have their genitals altered by choice. For example, phalloplasty is a procedure in which female genitals are changed from their original state to a state resembling male genitals. There are also cases of women undergoing labiaplasty to increase or decrease the size of their labia. Female Circumcision Risks and Complications Risks and complications associated with female circumcision can arise from any type of procedure, and they can manifest as immediate or long-term complications. - Immediate Risks and Complications - Immediate risks occur at the time of a procedure and can include: - Psychological trauma - Severe pain during the procedure - Excessive bleeding (hemorrhage) - Infection at the site of the procedure - Damage to nearby tissues or organs - Shock due to pain and trauma - Wound healing problems - Urinary problems, including difficulty in passing urine - Tetanus or other bacterial infections - Death as a result of severe bleeding, infection, or other complications - Decrease in pleasure with the removal of the clitoral gland - Long-term Risks and Complications - Long-term risks or complications can arise a short or long time after a procedure and can include: - Chronic pain in the genital area - Urinary problems, including recurrent infections - Development of cysts or abscesses - Formation of scar tissue (keloids) - Menstrual problems, such as irregular periods or difficulty in menstrual flow - Sexual dysfunction and decreased sexual pleasure - Psychological trauma, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Obstetric complications during childbirth, including prolonged labor, perineal tears, and increased risk of maternal and infant mortality - Difficulties with urination and sexual intercourse - Increased risk of pelvic infections and reproductive tract infections Clitorectomy: Cultural and Social Influences Clitoridectomies and their practices are influenced by various cultural and social factors. These practices are not confined to specific religious, geographical, or social contexts. FGM is influenced by geographical distribution, and numerous cultural groups practice it in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and some immigrant communities in Western countries. Countries with high prevalence include Somalia, Guinea, Djibouti, Egypt, Sudan, Mali, and others. The United States historically performed clitoridectomies during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some physicians promoted the procedure, believing it could prevent or cure various medical and psychological conditions, including hysteria, epilepsy, and mental disorders. In 1996, the first law referring to FGM was enacted, which made it a federal crime to knowingly perform, attempt to perform, or conspire to perform FGM on anyone under 18 years within the jurisdiction of the United States. FGM is deeply rooted in specific cultural beliefs, social norms, and traditional practices. It is often seen as a rite of passage, a way to control female sexuality, ensure virginity, preserve family honor, and maintain community cohesion. Moreover, in some societies, it is associated with religious or spiritual beliefs, although no significant religious texts endorse or require the practice. Furthermore, some communities may hold misconceptions about the health benefits of FGM, such as improved hygiene, reduced promiscuity, or enhanced fertility. Human Rights Issues Clitoridectomies are widely recognized as severe violations of human rights. One primary reason for this is the presence of various immediate and long-term health concerns. Other key reasons include: - Violation of Bodily Integrity and Autonomy: FGM can violate a person's fundamental right to bodily integrity and autonomy, as it is often performed on young girls and women who cannot give informed consent or exercise control over their bodies. - Discrimination and Gender Inequality: In many societies, FGM is deeply rooted in gender inequality and discrimination and reflects the subjugation of women and girls, perpetuating harmful gender norms and practices that undermine their rights, freedom, and equality. The World Health Organization (WHO) has taken a clear stance against all types of FGM, highlighting its harmful consequences and explicitly advising that health professionals should not perform FGM. The organization strongly condemns the practice and emphasizes that there are no health benefits. Instead, it poses significant risks to physical and mental health, violating the principle of medical ethics. Lesson Summary A clitoridectomy, also known as female genital mutilation or female circumcision, is a procedure in which part or all of a women's clitoris, a sensitive organ located at the top of the vulva. There are four main types of female genital mutilation which can involve the removal of the prepuce, the skin covering the clitoris, and part or all of the clitoris, the labia minora, the inner skin folds of the vulva, or the labia majora, the outer skin folds of the vulva. FGM can also involve narrowing the vagina by sewing the labia minora or majora together. Medical clitoridectomies are rarely considered but may be conducted in certain circumstances. These circumstances may include cancer, trauma, congenital issues, cosmetic surgery, and intersex conditions, where an individual's physical sex characteristics do not align with typical male or female anatomy. FGM can be influenced by various factors, such as geographical location, religious or spiritual beliefs, and cultural traditions. However, critics maintain that this practice violates human rights as it often violates bodily integrity and autonomy. Moreover, FGM perpetuates harmful gender norms and practices which undermine female rights, freedom, and equality. Moreover, all female genital circumcisions can hold a risk of immediate and long-term risks. These risks can include psychological trauma, pain, bleeding, and infection. "}
