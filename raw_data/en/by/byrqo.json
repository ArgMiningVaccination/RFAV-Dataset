The transmission of bloodborne pathogens or other microbial pathogens to practitioners and patients in acupuncture practices due to unsafe practices is unacceptable. Acupuncture practitioners and office personnel are at risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C viru s (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although this risk has lessened due to CNT procedures in the last 10 years,(1) exposures to such pathogens can occur through needlesticks or cuts from other sharp instruments contaminated with an infected patient's blood, or t hrough contact of the eye, nose, mouth, or skin with a patient's blood. The vast majority of blood to blood contacts resulting from healthcare procedures do not result in infection. (2) Of the b loodborne pathogens, HBV is the most likely to be passed by needlestick exposure.(2) HBV infection is usually preventable through a vaccine series. The only sure method of preventing HIV and HCV is abstinence from activities that involve the exchange of potentially infected body f luids. In the health care workplace, accidental contact with potentially contaminated blood or body fluids may be unavoidable. However, strict observance of standard precautions can prevent infe ction from exposure, including bloodborne pathogens such as HBV, HCV, and HIV. (3) Personal protective equipment (PPE) as defined by t he federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is \"specialized clothing or e quipment, worn by an employee for protection against infectious materials.\"(4) Gloves are the most common type of PPE used in healthcare settings.(4) Most patient care activitie s that involve mucus membranes, blood or OPIM require the use of a single pair of nonsterile gloves made of either nitrile or vinyl. (5) Gloves protect the healthcare worker against contac t with infectious materials. Gloves do not prevent needlestick injuries. (6, 7) Once contaminated, gloves can become a means for sp reading infectious materials. Gloves must be changed between patient visits and handwashing m ust be performed immediately after removing gloves. (8) Gloves need to be used by acupuncturists when blood or OPIM is expected to be present during a healthcare procedure. (8, 9, 10) There are no stud ies of glove use in the acupuncture setting. However, acupuncture needle insertion is similar to injection practices so guidelines for injections and vaccine administration can be used t o formulate guidelines for the practice of acupuncture. 2 Occupational Safety and Health Administration regul ations do not require gloves to be worn when administering vaccines unless the person admin istering the vaccine is likely to come into contact with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on the hands. (4, 11) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), r outine intradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular injection administration does not req uire the use of gloves if the health worker's skin is intact. (12) The Centers for Disease Contro l (CDC) similarly recommends glove use only when anticipating direct contact with blood or body fluids, mucous membranes, nonintact skin and other potentially infectious material.(13) It d oes not recommend the use of gloves routinely for injections. (7) Acupuncture needle insertion is similar to a subcut aneous or intramuscular vaccine or medication needle insertion. Since bleeding occurs only rarely during needle insertion, gloves are not needed for acupuncture needle insertion. This interpretation was echoed in a letter from OSH A to an inquiry of May 11, 2005, from the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs rega rding the use of gloves for acupuncture: \"According to the WHO, the needle penetration used f or acupuncture is described to be similar to a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. In ge neral, OSHA does not consider it necessary to use gloves when giving subcutaneous or intramusc ular injections as long as bleeding that could result in hand contact with blood or OPIM is not anticipated. The same would be true with acupuncture procedures as long as contact with bloo d is not anticipated .\"(14) Gloves Required during Needle Insertion: A very few needling point locations do require glov e use due to their location on or near mucous membranes. These include Ren 1 (huiyin), 2, Du 1 (c hangqian), jinjin and yuye (M-HN-20). Gloves must be worn if the health worker's skin is NOT intact (e.g. through eczema, or cracked or dry skin, or an open lesion on the hands). (12) Gloves must be worn if the skin of the patient being needled is similarly not intact. Glove Use for Needle Removal: The risk of bleeding during most acupuncture needle removal is less than 4%. (15) There is generally no need for gloves during needle removal. Surveillance of immunization adverse events similarly does not report bleeding as being observed regularly. (16) However, OSHA states that \" If an employee is required to clean and dress the a cupuncture sites following the extraction of the needles and any ble eding is anticipated, then gloves must be worn when doing so. \" (14) This reinforces the need to wear gloves when the patient's skin in the area where acupuncture is being applied is not intact. Glove Use for Other Procedures: The practices acupuncturists utilize that do requir e glove use include bleeding techniques and wet cupping techniques. Since expelling blood is p art of the therapeutic process for these practices, gloves must be worn. CONCLUSIONS: 3 The evidence suggests that both the practitioner's hands and the patient's skin at the acupuncture point need to be clean prior to adminis tration of a needle. Glove use is not needed for routine needle insertio n or removal. Glove use is required for acupuncture when needling areas of non-intact skin, or mucus membranes. Glove use is required when performing procedures th at involve the expression of blood, such as bleeding techniques and wet cupping. Proper hand hygiene includes handwashing upon remov al of gloves.
