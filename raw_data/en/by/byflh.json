There's a chance that your immune system is not strong enough. People with low immunity tend to fall ill more often than others. With fast-paced lifestyles, an increase in pollution and new infections and viruses threatening your wellbeing, the need for a strong immune system is now a priority. The immune system is a complex unit and can be strengthened with the help of certain vitamins and natural Ayurvedic herbs. When consumed daily, these vitamins and supplements can keep diseases away or help your body fight them better. Let's find out what they are. Highlights: How Does Immune System Works In Our Body? Your immune system is a complex network of cells and organs that help your body to fight any foreign invasion. The immune system is tuned to recognize and immediately respond to viruses, bacteria, germs and toxins to keep you healthy. Everyone is born with an Innate Immune System. As you grow, your body is exposed to other, unknown foreign objects. These new invasions develop your Adaptive Immune System. Both [innate and adaptive immune systems](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/innate-and-adaptive-immunity-difference) work hand in hand to remove microbes from your body. To understand what can aid your immune system to work better, let us first look at what it is made up of: 1. Physical Barriers Your skin is the largest physical barrier that covers your entire body and protects it from various foreign invasions. It includes mucous membranes that cover your mouth, respiratory tract, intestines and urinary tract. Physical barriers are part of the innate immunity that you were born with. 2. Humoral Immunity and Cell Mediated Immunity These are the two types of immunity functions performed by your adaptive immune system. Simply put, humoral immunity or that involving body fluids, removes antigens with the help of antibodies that circulate in the body fluids. ell mediated immunity fights pathogens mainly with the help of T-lymphocyte cells. How Does Each Part Of The Immune System Work? A. WBC or White Blood Cells WBCs keep circulating throughout your body to locate the existence of microbes. B. Antibodies Antibodies are proteins that target antigens in order to remove them from your body. C. The Complement Cascade The Complement Cascade aids the antibodies in destroying microbes. D. Spleen The spleen is a lymphatic organ that filters your blood by removing old red blood cells and microbes. E. Thymus The Thymus is a tiny organ in your body which produces T cells that are very important in the adaptive immune system to fight new microbes that enter your body. F. Bone Marrow Your WBCs are produced in the bone marrow along with red blood cells and platelets that help in clotting your blood. Can Vitamins & Supplements Help Boost Your Immune System? According to medical experts, vitamins [ [1](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/eat-these-foods-to-boost-your-immune-system/)] and supplements play an important role in promoting your body's defence system and aiding its immune response to pathogens. According to research, a drop in vitamin levels can directly affect the body's immune activities. Vitamins A, B, C, D and E help in the formation of white blood cells and antibodies. B-complex vitamins and vitamins A, D and E foster the development of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Inadequate supply of vitamins can weaken the body's ability to fight pathogens, thus making you vulnerable to viruses, bacteria and other infections. Our busy lives often make it difficult to include [all the necessary foods in our daily diet](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/ayurvedic-foods-that-boost-immunity). The body's nutrition requirement however needs to be fulfilled for the immune system and other organs to function properly. This is where supplements can help. Frequent consumption of antibiotics especially for cold and fever is harmful for your immune system as it kills both good and bad bacteria in your gut. Most fevers and colds are anyway caused by viruses which cannot be killed through antibiotics. What Vitamins Boost The Immune System? 1. Vitamin A Vitamin A is a key component that strengthens the body's immune response to pathogens. According to research, Vitamin A also helps in the production of white blood cells that protect the body against germs. Apart from WBC formation, it also aids in the multiplication of lymphocytes, when your body deals with infections. Vitamin A is known to improve gut health, which plays a very important role in your body's combined immune response. As per case studies, Vitamin A supplements helped children who were suffering from intestinal diseases. Sources of Vitamin A Vitamin A can be derived from both plant and animal sources. Colourful vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, squash, mangoes, sweet potato and kale are good sources. Best animal sources for Vitamin A include liver (lamb), fish oil, salmon, mackerel and tuna. Dairy products such as cheese and butter also contain some amounts of Vitamin A. Amount To Consume 900 micrograms of Vitamin A for men and 700 mcg for women is considered the amount required to meet an adult's daily need. 2. Vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 plays a key role in regulating the amount of homocysteine (a type of amino acid) in your blood. An increase in homocysteine can lead to various heart conditions. Vitamin B6 improves immune response, promotes antibody creation and the proliferation of lymphocytes when the body is under a pathogen attack. Sources of Vitamin B6 Best sources of Vitamin B6 are cereals, rice, onions, potatoes, meat, liver and fish. Amount To Consume The recommended amount of Vitamin B6 is 1.3 mg per day for adults. 3. Vitamin B9 Studies indicate that a deficiency of Vitamin B9 or Folic Acid [ [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1887065/)] can affect how efficiently your body reacts to a microbe invasion. Folic acid is important for the production of blood cells, which also affects the body's immune system. Sources of Vitamin B9 Green leafy vegetables are great sources of Vitamin B9.

Vitamin C Vitamin C or Ascorbic Acid is an irreplaceable vitamin that actively [boosts your immune system](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-boost-your-immune-system). It plays an important role in lymphocyte multiplication during an infection. It also helps in the migration of Neutrophils (a type of WBC that fights pathogens) to the site of infection. Low vitamin C levels affect your body's immune response and reduces its ability to fight microbes.

When the body is back to its normal conditions, the level of Vitamin C is restored. Stable Vitamin C levels can help your body easily fight pathogens that cause cold, cough and fever related symptoms. Sources of Vitamin C Indian gooseberry, spinach, broccoli, green peas, citrus fruits, and kiwi are good sources.

Vitamin D is also associated with antibody-formation that helps your immune system combat a foreign invasion. Sources of Vitamin D The natural source of Vitamin D is sunlight. Other food sources include milk, yogurt, cheese, fish, cod liver oil, eggs, and orange juice. Amount To Consume 15 mcg of Vitamin D is the recommended dose to be consumed daily. 7. Vitamin E Vitamin E aids in the proliferation of T-lymphocytes, which help your body to fight infections. Vitamin E also helps remove free radicals from the cells of your body tissues.
