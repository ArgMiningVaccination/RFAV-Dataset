Key times to consider testing: - If you have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), test right away. - If you were exposed to COVID-19 and do not have symptoms, wait at least 5 full days after your exposure before testing. If you test too early, you may be more likely to get an inaccurate result. [Check this page for more information about what to do if you've been exposed and follow isolation guidelines from the CDC.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/if-you-were-exposed.html) - If you are in certain high-risk settings, you may need to test as part of a screening testing program. - Consider testing before contact with someone at high risk for severe COVID-19, especially if COVID levels are moderate or high in your community. COVID testing is becoming part of the traditional health care system and may be covered by health insurance. COVID tests are available from many healthcare providers, including doctor's offices, urgent cares, and pharmacies.
