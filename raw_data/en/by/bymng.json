I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Yvette Berry MLA, as the Minister for the Prevention of Domestic and Family Violence, and of the Coordinator -General of Family Safety, J o Wood, whose office transitioned to the Community Services Directorate on 1 July 2017. The directorate continued to partner with the Coordinator-General on a range of initiatives to improve responses to family violence. In July 2017, the directorate launched its Workforce Strategy 2017 -19 (the Strategy), which aims to ensure a workforce that is engaged, enabled and empowered to achieve the directorate's strategic goals and operational imperatives into the future. The focus of the Strategy is for the direct orate to be seen as an employer of choice, to be achieved through driving best practice in contemporary and responsive workforce management systems. During the reporting period, as part of the Strategy, the directorate commenced work towards becoming a Whi te Ribbon Accredited Workplace. This work is being strongly supported by staff and we are well towards gaining accreditation in the 2018- 19. The directorate also established the Office of Chief Operating Officer in February 2018, and the Chief Operating Officer position, which supports our 'One JACS, One Corporate' approach. This approach complements the Workforce Strategy to provide a more strategic and coordinated level of services in support of our priorities. As part of this work, we combined our Capital Works, Infrastructure and ICT teams to provide better alignment of service delivery. I am also proud of the work within the directorate to promote our core values of respect, integrity, collaboration and innovation. I am absolutely committed to promoting the diversity of our workforce, as we continue our commitment to celebrate an inclusive culture where all staff are treated with respect and fairness. This commitment has been supported in during the reporting period through the continued implementation o f: the JACS Inclusion Statement 2016- 2019 - which sets the foundation on which the directorate will progress its efforts to build an inclusive workplace culture.

Students learnt about careers in the justice sector and learnt about difference job pathways. Business units promoted the directorate as an employer of choice at a number of events. The directorate participated in CareersXpo 2017 to raise awareness of career opportunities in the directorate and the service and support available to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in the ACT. Staff and volunteers from the four services of ESA participated in the CareersXpo. This included: the ACTF&R Kanbi (Ngunnawal word for \"Fire\") fire pumper that features artwork by a local Indigenous artist ACTSES volunteers spoke to event attendees to promote becoming an ACTSES volunteer. To support and develop our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees, the directorate: continued participation in the network for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees, through the Murranga Murranga ACTPS Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employee Network supported participation in the 6th Indigenous Women's Leadership Summit, National Aboriginal Wellbeing and nationally accredited conflict mediation training provided coaching and mentoring opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff encouraged participat ion in leadership and management programs by allocating places for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees encouraged all staff to have a current performance and development plan which consists of a learning and development plan and career developm ent plan. Directorate staff also participated in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Cultural Awareness training. Operational staff from ACT Corrective Services are required to attend this training as part of their induction program. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 27 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Many of these achievements ec ho targets identified in the Inclusion Statement 2016 -19 which sets the foundation to progress efforts to build an inclusive workplace culture. Community-based Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Programs and Projects Providing an Accessible Justice System Galambany Court Galambany Court has existed as part of the ACT Magistrates Court jurisdiction since 2004. Galambany Court recognises the ongoing disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the criminal justice system and seeks to address offending behaviour within a culturally sensitive framework. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Panel Members assist in the sentencing process by making culturally appropriate recommendations to the presiding Magistrate. in 2017 -18 amendments to the Magistrates Court Act were made establishing the Children's Circle Sentencing Court. The new court is called Warrumbul Court, which is the Ngunnawal word for 'youth'. Outward B ound 'Skills for Life' Program In late 2016 -17, Outward Bound Australia was engaged to deliver a further 'Skills for Life' program that will provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander defendants with a culturally appropriate sentencing option. The progr am targets women and men aged 18 to 25 years and aims to build resilience, self- awareness, self -confidence, teamwork skills and leadership qualities through gender- specific camps. A cultural program has been integrated throughout the high impact adventure therapy course to strengthen cultural knowledge and connection while developing key interpersonal skills. The program was extended in June 2018 for a further 6 month period in order to facilitate more opportunities for eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to attend with camps planned for September and November 2018. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Experience Court Reports - Ngattai As part of the program of work under the Justice Reform Strategy, the Government commissioned Legal Aid ACT to design a framework for the creation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Experience Court Reports which has been finalised in June 2017 . Based on the Canadian Gladue style reports, the aim is to provide the courts with pre-sentence information ab out an offender's community, family and personal circumstances and the impact of the cultural, social and historical issues confronted by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Restorative Justice Indigenous Guidance Partners The Restorative Justice Unit (RJU) has two full-time identified Indigenous Guidance Partners (IGP) who support Indigenous youth and adults involved in restorative justice referrals. The IGP is often the first point of contact for an Indigenous RJU client, building rapport and trust in the process and the convenor. The IGPs support Indigenous participants and their respective communities of care after referrals are received, and before, during and after conferences. The IGPs also liaise with police, courts, correctional and community-based agencies to provide information, encourage referrals and to connect clients with other relevant support services. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 28 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The RJU is trialling an Indigenous Convenor role. are the 'guardians' of the RJ process a nd make decisions about the suitability of participants and the matter as a whole to proceed. It is important that the RJU has Indigenous people filling roles that enhance a sense of empowerment in process and outcomes which will in turn inspire trust and engagement with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community. Restorative Justi ce Aboriginal and Torres Strai t Islander involvement - Young People In 2017 -18, 11 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people were referred to restorative justice by ACT Policing. This represents a drop of 45% from the 2016-17 financial year. All of these were referred for less-serious matters and as a diversion from court. A further 10 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people were referred by the Childrens' Court. Of these 21 young people, two were found eligible and suitable to proceed to conference, and two other young Indigenous offenders participated in conferences this financial year who were referred the previous year. Reasons for matters not being found suitable are particular to the circumstances of each case and may include a required victim participant declining to be involved. Reasons why young Indigenous young people did not participate included 'failed to attend appointments'(5), 'disputes responsibility'(1), 'declines to participate'(3) or 'was unable to be contacted'(7). Four agreements were formed in conferences in 2017-18, one conference agreement formed in 2016 -17 extended into 2017 -18. Of these, one agreement was complied with, three conferences were deemed satisfying without a formal agreement and one agreement was not complied with, resulting in a compliance rate of 80% for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people referred in 2017 -2018. Restorative Justice Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Involvement - Adults A total of 25 adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander offenders were referred in 2017-18. Four referrals included serious offences and one of those serious offences was addressed in a successful conference. Four adult Indigenous offenders referred in 2017-18 for less serious offences participated in conferences. Of these, one agreement is still being monitored and in the three other matters the conference itself satisfied participant's needs. Legal Assistance Services Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT) The ACT Government provides funding to the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) (NSW/ACT) to ensure that the local community has access to, and receives, much needed services. The ALS assists Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men, women and children through representation in court, advice and information, outreach support, referrals and access to brokerage funds. The Government has funded an additional duty lawyer since 2015-16, and has an interim funding arrangement in place for the community justice programs Front Up, Interview Friends, Galambany Court Support and Extended Throughcare . The ALS also receives Australian Government funding. Women's Legal Centre ACT The Women's Legal Centre ACT and Region receives ongoing funding to deliver the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Access to Justice Program. The program continues to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women with access to culturally ap propriate case management Justice and Community Safety Directorate 29 Annual Report 2017 -2018 support for a range of law and justice matters including domestic and family violence, care and protection, family law and employment discrimination. Supporting a Safe and Resilient Community New Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander justice service delivery model Legislation, Policy and Programs continued to work in partnership with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body (ATSIEB) throughout 2017- 18 to develop a justice service delivery model. An options paper was circulated following a community forum to seek the views of the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community on the preferred option for the new model. ALS (NSW/ACT) has been contracted to provide services. The current contract with ALS to deliver the services expires on 31 December 2018, while a rigorous procurement process for the new contract is undertaken in the latter half of 2018. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Partnership 2015 -18 The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Partnership (the Partnership) demonstrates the ACT Government's commitment to improving law and justice services and outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the ACT. The Partnership takes a targeted approach to addressing the over -representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the ACT criminal justice system and includes detailed actions, measures, and areas of accountability. The Partnership consists of a total of 21 actions areas with 38 key measures that, in some instances, are jointly addressed by lead agencies bringing the total number of reportable action items to 79. On 3 April 2018 it was agreed by the ACT ATSIEB that 42 reportable action items could be closed as they had either been completed or been considered to be consistently on track over the term of the Partnership. The object of this decision was to allow reporting agencies to focus on those remaining 37 action items that still required work and attention. By the end of the 2017- 2018 financial year: 16 action items were considered to be on track 13 actions were considered to be stalled as they were not progressing in line with the agreed timeframe, and eight action items were considered to be stopped as they had stalled considerably or were not likely t o be delivered in the life of the partnership. Justice Reinvestment and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Justice Reinvestment aims to reduce crime, enhance public safety and strengthen communities by developing a smarter, more cost -effective approach to criminal justice. During 2017-18 two trials focused exclusively on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community - the Yarrabi Bamirr Trial and the Ngur rambai Bail Support Trial. Yarrabi Bamirr Trial Yarrabi Bamirr (meaning Walk Tall in the Ngunnawal language) was officially launched at Winnunga Aboriginal Health and Community Services in April 2017. It involves using a family-centric model of Justice and Community Safety Directorate 30 Annual Report 2017 -2018 service support with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families to improve life outcomes and reduce or prevent contact with the criminal justice system. Yarrabi Bamirr is designed to address complex needs using a comprehensive approach that is co- designed with the client and their family. A range of agencies work collaboratively to support the issues clients are facing. This involves intensive support that, over time, builds the clients own capacity to navigate the issues they face and self-manage their affairs. As of June 2018, there are three Aboriginal services delivering this trial - Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services, Aboriginal Legal Service NSW/ACT, and Mulleun Mur a (meaning Eagle in Ngunnawal and based at the Women's Legal Service). In addition to the program funded through Winnunga, the Justice Reinvestment team commenced negotiations with ACTCS in May 2017 to explore how to integrate the Yarrabi Bamirr methodology into the Throughcare support given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people leaving prison. This resulted in two family-centric service delivery models. The Australian National University is conducting an independent evaluation of the Winnunga element of the trial which is expected to be available in the second half of 2018. Ngurrambai - Bail Support Trial Ngurrambai (meaning 'perceive - I see, I hear, I understand' in Ngunnawal) is the ACT's seco nd Justice Reinvestment trial. It is a two year trial, designed to reduce the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on remand, and time spent on remand. The program, launched by the Aboriginal Legal Service ACT/NSW on 7 December 2017, supports compliance with bail orders and provides much needed assistance to navigate the justice and social service systems. Through tailored bail support plans, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are provided assistance to secure appropriate housing and are referred to programs and services relevant to their needs and circumstances. Support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the AMC NAIDOC Family Day ACTCS holds a Family Day event annually as part of the NAIDOC Week celebrations. It provides the opportunity for detainees in the AMC and their families to come together to mark NAIDOC Week and is an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander culture. The event was an invitation only event and attracted the inclusion of 70 detainees and 84 adults and 44 children on the day. Activities at the July 2017 celebration included face painting for children, live music delivered by a band of detainee musicians and traditional Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dancing by men and women detainees. The NAIDOC National Committee selects the theme for the event each year. The 2017 theme titled 'Our Languages Matter' aimed to emphasise and celebrate the unique and essential role that Indigenous languages play in both cultural identity, linking people to their land and water, and in the transmission of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, spirituality and rites, through story and song. The ev ent received positive feedback from detainees, their families, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community service providers, and the ACT ATSIEB. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 31 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Art Programs and Initiatives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees have the opportunity to engage in art production in a number of ways. They may attend formal art classes run by AMC Education, attend the Indigenous Traditional Culture Healing Yarning (ITCHY) Arts program and they also have the opportunity to purchase art supplies through buy -ups and create artwork from within their cells. Detainees also have the opportunity to exhibit and sell their artwork through the annual NAIDOC Community Art Exhibition. ITCHY Arts Program The ITCHY Arts Program continued during 2017- 18 coordinated by Gugan Gulwan Youth Aboriginal Corporation. The program focuses on art and music and provides Indigenous detainees an opportunity to meet in a safe, culturally appropriate environment, creating a sense of belonging and pride in participation. The object of participation is to assist in rehabilitation and to encourage detainees to engage in other services both within custody and in the community to enhance community reintegration. NAIDOC Community Art Exhibition Since 2013, the Community Services Directorate has partnered with ACTCS as part of NAIDOC celebrations to exhibit and sell detainee and offender artwork within its gallery in Narrabundah over a three week period. This partnership is due to continue in 2018 with a four week exhibition spanning July and including extended Saturday public viewing. Rehabilitation Programs Culture and Land Management Program The Culture and Land Management (CALM) Program (the Program) is a full time, holistic education/employment based program offered at the AMC that integrates many aspects of traditional Indigenous culture including art, dance, music, languages, kinship, weaving, family history, horticulture, construction, conservation and land management. While the significant learning aspects of the course centre around horticulture, conservation and land management, the underlying intention is to develop language, literacy and numeracy foundation skills which have been embedded into the Program. CALM is delivered in collaboration with Greening Australia, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service and the Aboriginal Natural Resource Management Facilitator for the Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate. At the heart of the Program is a Certificate II in Foundation Skills for Work and Vocational Pathways. This Certificate has Vocational Education (VET) horticulture units as an elective skill set that detainees complete. The Program has been in operation since 2014 with components being extended, broadened and enhanced over time. In 2016-17, 36 (24 men and 12 women) detainees participated in the program. In 2016 -17, one detainee who fully completed the program has now moved to the Transitional Release Cottage at the AMC, and recently accompanied the CALM facilitator and members of Greening Australia, rangers from ACT Parks and Wildlife, and other local cultural individuals on a native plant seed collecting field trip in ACT bushland. Looking ahead, ACTCS is working to strengthen and improve the Program in the coming year and is considering introducing new components, including a native seed bank and a native grasslands restoration project to provide the opportunity for new learning activities. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 32 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The Progra m was recognised at the 2017 ACT NAIDOC Week Awards, being awarded the 2017 Caring for Country Award. Elders and Community Leaders Visitation Program This Elders and Community Leaders Visitation Program was strengthened and refreshed in 2016. It provides cultural connection and strengthening through formal monthly visits to the AMC by local Community Elders and other Community leaders. Additional special visits also occur on an identified needs basis. Dhunlung Yarra Indigenous Counsellor Serv ice Fortnightly counselling is provided by the Dhunlung Yarra Service to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees. This is a dedicated Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander therapeutic service staffed by Aboriginal professionals within Relationships Australia Canberra and Region, with detainee specific therapy also available on a needs basis. Indigenous Pastoral Care Culturally relevant pastoral care under a specific Indigenous chapel service has been made available to detainees every three weeks. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 33 Annual Report 2017 -2018 B.2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - OUTPUT 1.1 POLICY ADVICE AND JUSTICE PROGRAMS OUTPUT DESCRIPTION The Legislation, Policy and Programs (LPP) unit provides high quality policy, legislation, ministerial support and advice to portfolio Ministers, Cabinet and other agencies on justice and community safety matters. LPP also administers innovative justice and crime prevention programs (including the Restorative Justice Program) across the government and the community. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 1 - PROMOTE AND PROTECT RIGHTS AND INTERESTS LPP plays an important role in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ACT citizens. LPP also assesses all ACT Government legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) . Inspector of Correction al Services The early work to deliver on the Government's commitment to create an Inspector of Correctional Services undertaken in 2016-17 was finalised by LPP in 2017- 18. The Inspector of Correctional Services Act 2017 (ACT) established a new oversight mechanism and independent statutory authority, called the Inspector of Correctional Services, to oversee and critically examine the operations of the adult and youth correctional system with a preventative focus. The Inspector 's role is to: undertake inspections of correctional centres and services every two years against a review framework review critical incidents to ensure policies, procedures and legislation promote best practice undertake the review o f a particular issue in the youth or adult corrections environment referred by the responsible Minister or DirectorGeneral, to ensure policies, procedures and legislation promote best practice be able to conduct an unannounced visit in accordance with the role provide independent reports to the ACT Legislative Assembly, and if appropriate and practicable, consult with people, or use staff, suitable to the cultural background or vulnerability of any detainee involved in a matter being examined or reviewed. This includes if a review or critical incident relates to an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander detainee, female detainee, detainee with disability or detainee from a culturally or linguistically diverse background. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 34 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 3 ACT' s First Inspector of Corre ctional Services Neil McAllister The passing of the legislation, followed by the appointment of the ACT's first Inspector of Correctional Services, was the culmination of a significant program of work designed to improve the treatment and care of detainees in custody. Mr Neil McAllister commenced his role as ACT's first Inspector of Correctional Services on 14 March 2018 for a term of five years. Charter of Rights for Victims In the Parliamentary Agreement for the 9th Legislative Assembly for the ACT, the Government committed to introducing a Charter of Rights for Victims of Crime (the Charter) in the ACT. The Charter aims to recognise the centralit y of victims within the criminal justice system, ensure victims receive reliable and consistent treatment and enhance justice system and victim support agency accountability. LPP is supporting the Victims Advisory Board to advise the Minister for Justice, Consumer Affairs and Road Safety on what a Charter would look like and how it could be implemented in the ACT. During the year an options paper formed the basis of community consultations and LPP will continue to work closely with key government stakeholders to develop the recommended model. Legislative Amendments During 2017 18, LPP assisted the Government in the development, explanation and implementation of legislation relevant to the promotion and protection of rights. Notable examples include: Implemen tation of the Freedom of Information Act 2016 o In 2017 18, LPP continued to assist the cross government Freedom of Implementation Working Group in preparing for commencement of the Freed om of Information Act 2016 (FOI Act) on 1 January 2018. LPP's continuin g role included providing general guidance about the anticipated operation of particular provisions to ACT and preparation of subordinate legislation. Officers supported the Attorney General in considering and enacting a regulation to define the heads of 'territory authorities' and 'territory instrumentalities' for the purposes of the FOI Act. This regulation provided clarity to public sector bodies and corporations Justice and Community Safety Directorate 35 Annual Report 2017 -2018 established under a territory law, such as the Cultural Facilities Corporation and the University of Canberra, about who is responsible for appointing decision - makers under the FOI Act. LPP also prepared and submitted a revised fees determination to the Attorney -General for consideration and signature, to t ake account of new restrictions on calculating fees for access to Government information. Review of oversight resources o Recommendation 15 of the Review into the system level responses to family violence in the ACT was that 'a review should be undertaken to determine whether the oversight resources of the Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner and the resources to respond in the Community Services Directorate are sufficient to ensure oversight mechanisms are workin g effectively'. LPP undertook a tender process to select an independent reviewer, and managed the contract. Spring Green Consulting was the successful tenderer, who engaged with a range of stakeholders and provided a review report. At the end of the financial year, that report was being prepared for distribution. Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture o In anticipation of the Australian Government ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OPCAT) in December 2017, LPP engaged internal business units and ACT Policing to inform arrangements for the protocol's implementation. As a result of these discussions, LPP supported the Minister for Just ice, Consumer Affairs and Road Safety's consideration and introduction of the Monitoring of Places of Detention (Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture) Bill 2017 , which was passed in February 2018. This legislation provides a legal framework for staff to assist the United Nations Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture when visiting ACT places of detention, including in relation to access to facilities, interviewees and requested information. At the end of the financial year, LPP is continui ng to liaise with jurisdictions and the Commonwealth Ombudsman in its newly established role as National Preventive Mechanism Coordinator to prepare for implementation, including the establishment of a National Preventive Mechanism component for the ACT, b y December 2021. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2 - PROVIDE AN ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE SYSTEM LPP assists the Government to improve access to justice for the ACT community through legislation and policy aimed at supporting and shaping the ACT's civil and criminal justice systems. LPP also prepares data for public release about criminal justice and justice services. National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse In 2017 -18, LPP led the ACT's contribution to the development of the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (the Scheme). The Scheme is in response to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The ACT procured Finity Consulting in 2017 to scope the potential for applications related to abuse which occurred in ACT institutions. Finity Consulting estimated that the ACT would generate 830 Justice and Community Safety Directorate 36 Annual Report 2017 -2018 redress applications in a national scheme that would include private institutions. It was estimated that 226 of these applications would relate to ACT Government institutions. The Intergovernmental Agreement on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse was signed on 1 May 2018 and the ACT Government has declared that all ACT Government institutions will be participating in the Scheme. In the lead up to the 1 July 2018 launch of the Scheme, LPP initiated and continues to chair a whole of government implementation group that is working to put in place processes which will ensure that ACT Directorates respond effectively to applications which involve abuse which occurred in organisations for which they are, or were, responsible. A position will be established to coordinate the provision of information by ACT Government agencies, in response to applications made under the Scheme. LPP continues to work closely with the Commonwealth Department of Social Services which is administering the receipt of applications to the Scheme. Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse On 15 June 2018, the ACT Government announced its response to all the recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, including its Criminal Justice Report which made 85 criminal justice recommendations. Those recommendations propose legislative and non- legislative reform s across the criminal justice system to better prevent and protect children from child sexual abuse, as well to improve access to justice for victims. The recommendations include new offences for the protection of children from abuse, changes to sentencing processes and evidence laws, and the improvement of measures designed to mitigate trauma in child sexual abuse proceedings - including the introduction of an intermediaries scheme. A Child Abuse Royal Commission: Criminal Justice Reform Team was established in 2017-18 and progressed a number of the 85 criminal justice recommendations in the Crimes (Legislation Amendment) Bill 2017 (No 2) which was passed by the Legislative Assembly on 20 February 2018. The amendments: Made existing offences for persistent child sexual abuse more effective, better reflecting how child sexual abuse is experienced and remembered Changed to the way child sexual abuse offenders are sentenced by preventing an offender's 'good character' from being considered if that 'good character' enabled them to commit the offence Made two new grooming offences criminalising non -electronic grooming of a child, as well as grooming of people other than a child (e.g. parents). LPP supported ACT Government consultation with the community and key st akeholders in the first half of 2018, on additional criminal justice criminal justice reforms. LPP has used the outcome of this consultation and consultation with the Sexual Assault Reform Program to develop reforms for inclusion in legislation in 2018- 19. Legal Assistance Services In 2017 -18, the directorate continued to facilitate service planning for the legal assistance sector as required under the National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services (NPA). LPP Justice and Community Safety Directorate 37 Annual Report 2017 -2018 administers this function on behalf of the ACT Government and represents the directorate as chair of the ACT Legal Assistance Forum. The National Partnership Agreement on Legal Assistance Services 2015-2020 (NPA) is an agreement between the Commonwealth, States and Territories which sets out arrangements for the delivery of Commonwealth funded legal services by Legal Aid Commissions and Community Legal Centres. The objective of the NPA is a national legal assistance sector that is integrated, efficient and effective, focused on improving access to justice for disadvantaged people and maximising service delivery within available resources. The NPA requires a review to be completed approximately 18 months prior to the expiration of the NPA on 30 June 2020. This review is currently underway and will assess the effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness of the NPA as a mechanism for achieving its objective and outcomes within available resources and identify best practice and opportunities for improvement. The review is being conducted by an independent assessor, supported by a Steering Committee (comprised of representatives of the parties to the NPA, being the Commonwealth, States and Territories) and an Advisory Group (comprised of representatives from the legal assistance sector). The directorate represents the ACT Government on the Steering Committee and to date has been involved in the Steering Committee's management of the preliminary stages of the Review, including developing terms of reference and choosing an independent assessor to conduct the review from a tender process. The outcomes of the review will help inform future funding arrangements for legal assistance services from 1 July 2020. Justice and Community Safety Legislation Amendment Bills The Justice and Community Safety Legislation Amendment Bill program allows the government to make changes to directorate portfolio legislation that do not amount to major changes to existing policy. Two Justice and Community Safety Legislation Amendment Bills were passed by the Legislative Assembly in 2017 -18. These Bills included amendments to the ACT's Family Violence Act 2016 to ensure that there is no gap in a court's ability to recognise interstate family violence orders in the ACT or have orders declared as recognised orders in the ACT and recognised interstate. The Bills also included corrections to drafting inconsistencies and helped to better align the ACT with a number of different national standards. Drug and Alcohol Court The Government is committed to establishing a Drug and Alcohol Court in the Territory which will take a problem-solving approach aimed at reducing recidivism and improving the health and well- being of offenders. LPP has continued to progress the program of work to design and plan the Drug and Alcohol Court. This includes: supporting the Supreme Court to develop proposals to Government for a suitable model; working with the University of New South Wales to develop an evaluation framework and program logic; and working with government and non- government organisations to id entify and plan all aspects of the court. Disability Justice Strategy During 2017 -18 work was progressed on developing a Disability Justice Strategy for the ACT (the Strategy). When finalised, the Strategy will seek to ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to the law and equal treatment before the law. Working in partnership with the Office for Disability, Community Services Directorate, LPP undertook research into the issues affecting people Justice and Community Safety Directorate 38 Annual Report 2017 -2018 with disability, began stakeholder and public consultation and sponsored a Law Week event on disability justice with respected expert Professor Eileen Baldry, Victims of Crime Commissioner Heidi Yates and Ms Jeanette Purkis, a women with lived experience of disability and the justice system. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Partnership 2015 - 2018 The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Justice Partnership demonstrates the ACT Government's commitment to improving law and justice services and outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the ACT. More information can be found in section B.1 Organisational Overview. Restorative Justice 'A victim's right to restorative justice is a new robust global policy position which is growing in support today'. The ACT's voluntary Restorat ive Justice (RJ) Scheme promotes a voice for people affected by crime alongside the more formal criminal justice system. Eligible and suitable victims, offenders and their communities of care are supported to communicate, either face- to-face or by indirect means with the help of a trained restorative justice facilitator. The purpose of this program is to promote citizen empowerment in a non-adversarial justice process and promote understanding, empathy and reparation for victims of crime. Those responsible get the opportunity to explain their actions, reflect on their behaviour at the time and since, respond to victims needs and actively make amends. Sometimes, where appropriate, tasks are agreed to be performed by those who have caused harm and are related not only to making amends but also to what they can do to support their own development and community re-integration. These tasks form RJ Agreements which are signed by informed and consenting main participants and their supporters. Tasks must be reasonable, constructive and within the capacity of the individual to achieve. They often include financial reparation, apologies, counselling, or community volunteer work. Participation in RJ involves the informed consent of offenders and victims. Declining to participate carries no risk or penalty for either party. The ACT RJ Scheme has moved through phase one (2005 -16) where it only received referrals for less serious offences committed by juvenile offenders to the current phase two (February 2016) including adul t offenders and more serious offences for both juveniles and adults. The final phase (phase three) is expected to commence later in 2018 and will allow sexual offences and family violence offences to be eligible for referral. The Restorative Justice Unit (RJU) team has worked hard to collaborate with relevant ACT stakeholders working in these fields and to access appropriate training and development to prepare staff for responding to the needs of victim-survivors and offenders in this more complex and risk laden area. Entering phase three will complete the roll out of all phases of the Scheme. Referrals ACT Policing and the ACT Courts and Tribunal remained the strongest providers of restorative justice opportunities in 2017 -18. In 2017 -18, the RJU received a total of 260 referrals, the same number of referrals received in 2016-17. These referrals involved 555 offences, down 3% from the 573 offences referred in 2016 -17, 280 offenders, representing a 6% decrease from the 297 off enders referred in 2016 -17 and 476 victims, representing a 6% decrease from the 504 victims referred in 2016- 17. A total of 159 adults and 121 young offenders were referred to RJ in 2017- 18. Of the offences referred, 494 were less serious in terms of maximum potential penalties, while 61 were serious offences. Serious offences are those attracting a maximum imprisonment period of more than 10 years for a personal offence and more than 14 years for other offences. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 39 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 4 Referrals Received by Referred Entities Conferences Statistics related to conferences in 2017- 18 include conferences for offences that were referred in 2016 -17 (28 referrals received in 2016-17 went to conferences in 2017-18). RJU found 81 matters (28+53) matters eligible and suitable to proceed to conference (74 (46+28) of these referrals were finalised and seven were still actively being monitored in agreement stage). 50 referrals from the 2017 -18 FY were still under assessment. 157 referrals received in 2017- 18 were declared not suitable or not eligible, (compared to 141 referrals in 2016- 17). Of these 157 matters, 16 were found ineligible for multiple reasons, including: the ineligibility of commonwealth offences (includes offences such as trespass on Commonwealth premises); phase 3 offences being referred such as family violence offences which are not yet eligible and double referrals from ACT Policing and the Childrens ' Court. Conferences in 2017-18 included 53 young offenders, 35 adults and 102 victims. Sixty seven of these conferences were face- to-face and 17 were indirect (that is, through convenors at a distance, by sound recording, video or written). Total conferences decreased 29% compared to 2016 -17. The decrease in matters proceeding to conference may be partially attributable to a rising proportion of adult offender to young offender matters (from 43% to 57% in 2016 -17 to 57% to 43% in 2017 -18). Adult matters proceed to conference far less readily than juvenile matters which may reflect attitudes among the community (and victims) that adult offenders are set in their ways, do not deserve a victim's time or represent a larger personal threat to a victim. Another possible reason for a reduction in conferences in 2017-18 is the previously mentioned proportion of ineligible referrals (6%) and a higher rate of participants 58 offenders and 83 victims did not progress past the suitability phase (total of 141) compared with 43 offenders and 61 victims in the 2016 -17 financial year. Finally, matters referred by the judiciary and then sentenced prior to conferences taking place or agreements being completed can result in the loss of significant incentive for offenders and alleged offenders to follow through on their obligations to victims. Data will be kept in the next financial year to shine a stronger light on outcome variation according to continued Court oversight of RJ matters to point of completion. Restorative Justice Agreements and compliance In 2017 -18, 117 Restorative Justice Agreements were formed. Of these, seven are being monitored, 60 were complied with, 16 were not complied with and 30 conferences held satisfied the victim's needs. Four agreements reached in 2017-18 were substantially complied with. Excluding the agreements still being monitored, this has resulted in an average compliance rate of 85% for the financial year and 89% since 2005. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 40 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Survey Questionnaires After RJ conferences occur, follow-up surveys which gauge the experience of offenders, victims and supporting participants are administered by an independent agency. The survey response rate for 2017 -18 was 81%. The overall satisfaction rate of 98% in 2017-18 means that the RJU has met its key performance indicator target of 97%. Case study of adult victim - Offender conference held in the AMC This scenario involves on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person ('Jeff', in his 30's) and victims ('Paul' and 'James' both in their early 30's) at the AMC late in 2017. Jeff and co -offenders were involved in a destructive after-hours invasion of a lo cal store, leaving the owner and manager (Paul and James) and other staff of this family business significantly affected and financially impacted. They expressed concerns for their staff's future safety. Jeff was feeling bad about what he'd done. The store was in his local area and the staff had on many occasions showed kindness and generosity to him and his family with gifts of produce. Jeff had started taking Ice with his mates and then ended up involved in this reckless act. Throughout the preparation ph ase with the RJ convenor, Jeff was well supported by his AMC Case Manager and the RJU's Indigenous Guidance Partner (IGP). The IGP was later able to connect Jeff to an appropriate Indigenous support service to address issues affecting him, and his partner's tenuous situation in the community. Paul and James were initially angry and sceptical. They had some strong ideas about the kind of person Jeff was and were not confident that the conference process would be worth thei r while. Jeff was sure that Paul and James would judge him badly and would probably not accept his explanations and apology. At the conference, Jeff took full responsibility for his actions, explaining what he'd done and how he'd got involved in antisocial associations and offending activity. Jeff listened as Paul and James spoke about the impacts of the incident and the collective fear now present in the store, especially for the female workers. Jeff found a way to articulate and express his deep shame aro und having violating the friendly people at his local store. Importantly, Jeff was able to reassure Paul and James that a co-offender was no longer at large in the community and that their store was not likely to be targeted in future. Paul and James felt relieved and lighter. The AMC Case Manager was able to provide Paul and James some perspective on the progress that Jeff had made in his engagement with rehabilitation programs while in the AMC. Toward the end of the conference, the three men talked about fatherhood, its responsibilities and opportunities. While Paul and James were not fathers yet, they had been shocked to learn Jeff was a 'dad'. As involved uncles, they both saw themselves as fathers in the future and expressed their hope for Jeff's positi ve future with his son. Although Paul and James did not require any particular task of Jeff through a formal RJ Agreement process, they extended an invitation for Jeff to bring his son to their family store to say hello, once he was released and making his way again in the community. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 41 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Legislative Amendments The Courts and Other Justice Legislation Act 2018 (No 1) introduced a range of amendments to create further improvements and efficiencies in the administration of ACT court and tribunal structures and processes, and the operation of the ACT justice and coronial systems. o In particular, the Act modernised the process of empanelling juries, strengthened the jury summons enforcement process, revised the oath and affirmation process, and provided for better support for jurors with a disability, or who have English as a second language, so that they have equal opportunity to take part in this important public services o The Act made a number of changes to support the efficient finalisation of coronial inquests by a llowing the Coroner to more easily obtain medical records, delegate people to establish coronial investigation scenes and perform non -invasive examinations where appropriate. These changes will enhance the ability of the Coroner's Court to sensitively and quickly gather the evidence they need to establish the cause of death and identify matters of public safety, so the family can have the closure they need after the unexpected death of a loved one o The Act provided a wider role for the Associate Judge by vesting in them a jurisdiction that is equivalent to that of a single judge, other than to hear trials on indictment or matters before the Court of Appeal. Amendments to the Evidence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1991 clarify the process for ACT courts to ta ke evidence and submissions using audio-visual links or audio links with other places (including places outside Australia) in ACT proceedings. This will increase the ability of proceedings to be progressed efficiently. The Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill 2017 was introduced into the ACT Legislative Assembly on 14 September 2017 and passed on 24 October 2017. o This Bill amended the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 to improve consumer protections for users of commercial guarantees as an alternative to a rental bond. The Bill amended the Act to require a commercial guarantee to be registered with the Commissioner for Fair Trading, with the process and criteria for registration to be prescribed by regulation. The amendments also provided for delayed commenceme nt of the provisions relating to the registration process. This suspended the use of commercial guarantee products in the ACT until an appropriate regulatory regime could be developed o The Bill also updated the Act to support electronic lodgement of rental bonds and remove the requirements for signatures on rental bond lodgement forms. The Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill 2018 was introduced into the ACT Legislative Assembly on 10 May 2018 and passed on 5 June 2018. o This Bill made two significant amendme nts to the Residential Tenancies Act. The Bill provided an improved framework for residential tenancy agreements by creating greater certainty for vulnerable Canberrans by replacing conditional termination and possession orders (CTPOs) with payment orders. Unlike CTPOs, payment orders do not automatically end a tenancy if a tenant fails to pay rent. The amendments also provided a clear structure for lessors and tenants to manage rental arrears. The Bill also extended the delay on the use of commercial guara ntees as an alternative to a rental bond to give the Government further opportunity to consider the legal policy implications and conduct further stakeholder consultation. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 42 Annual Report 2017 -2018 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3 - PROVIDE EFFECTIVE REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT LPP supports the effective regulation and enforcement of legislation governing the regulatory functions of the ACT Government. This includes preparing policy frameworks and legislation, performing legislative reviews to ensure that the regulatory functions of Government are efficient and appropriate, and promoting integrity by addressing the risks associated with regulated industries. LPP assists the ACT Government's involvement in national discussions about legislative and policy frameworks by supporting Ministerial attendance at national forums including Councils for Attorneys-General, Ministers for Police and Emergency Management and the Transport and Infrastructure Council. Motorcycle lane filtering trial evaluation The two -year motorcycle lane filtering trial ended on 31 January 2017. Lane filtering continues to be allowed in the ACT pending the outcome of an evaluation of the trial. The evaluation will be based on a before and after study of accident data and community awareness of the rules relating to lane filtering. The evaluation will be finalised in 2018- 19. Graduated Licensing Scheme review Young, less experienced drivers are more vulnerable to being involved in a serious road crash. In the ACT, 15 young drivers were killed on our roads between 2006 and 2017. The re is also an over - representation of these drivers in serious injury crashes, with many of those sustaining life changing injuries. The current ACT Graduated Licensing Scheme (GLS) has limited staged restrictions on learner and provisional drivers such as zero blood alcohol, and restrictions on towing capacity. The proposed reform of the ACT's GLS involves a staged approach to driver licensing with restrictions and sanctions that are reduced as experience is gained. Evidence supports this approach in addressing major crash factors such as age, inexperience and risk taking. A public consultation was held via the YourSay website during April and May 2018, with more than 4000 responses. The purpose of the survey was to inform the timing of reforms, consider the appropriate staging of restrictions, whether they should apply to P1 or P2 drivers and for how long, and the development, design and application of any exemptions to minimise hardship o n members of our community. Interlock Program Evaluation The ACT's Alcohol Interlock Program (Interlock Program) commenced in 2014. Its primary purpose is to reduce the road safety risk posed by drink drivers to themselves and other road users by preventing the driver from starting, or continuing to operate, a vehicle fitted with an interlock device if the driver has a specified blood concentration of alcohol present in his or her breath. In August 2016, LPP engaged the Monash University Accident Research Centre to undertake an evaluation of the ACT Interlock Program. The evaluation will provide a mechanism for identifying the extent to which the design, establishment and operation of the Interlock Program reflects best Justice and Community Safety Directorate 43 Annual Report 2017 -2018 practice strategies in similar programs elsewhere, including eligibility criteria. It will also provide an assessment of whether the program has helped change attitudes to drinking and driving and investigate any barriers to uptake and completion of the program. The evaluation is due to be published later this year. Legislative Amendments During 2017 -18, LPP assisted the Government in the development, explanation and implementation of legislation relevant to providing effective regulation and enforcement. Examples include: The Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Amendment Regulation 2017 (No 1) ) to introduce 10 year driver licences and allow for driver licence photographs to be used for other ACT Government registration and licence types. These amended improved customer service, reduced red tape a nd supported Access Canberra to introduce online renewal of driver licences The Road Transport Reform (Light Rail) Legislation Amendment Act 2017 , passed in August 2017, supports the operation of light rail within the road environment of the ACT by integrating light rail vehicles within the ACT's compulsory third party insurance scheme. The Act included additional amendments to the Criminal Code 2002 to make it an offence to take a light rail vehicle, a bus or heavy vehicle without consent The Road Transpor t Reform (Light Rail) Legislation Amendment Act 2018 , passed in May 2018, focused on regulating the operation of the light rail as a public passenger service and provides the foundation for the delivery of light rail passenger services. The Act addressed matters such as ticketing and conduct and behaviour of passengers and persons engaging with the light rail service. The Act also takes the first steps in regulatory reform to create a seamless customer experience across the Territory's public transport netw ork The Road Transport (Road Rules) Regulation 2017 (the road rules regulation) commenced on 30 April 2018. This regulation applies the requirements of the Australian Road Rules (ARRs) and any local variations to them including provisions providing for \"another law of the jurisdiction\" in a single local regulation rather than adopting them by reference as had previously been the case. The road rules regulation adopts all nationally agreed packages of ARR amendments up to and including package 11 The Road Transport Legislation Amendment Regulation 2018 (No 1) , most of which commenced on 1 July 2018, provides for the abolition of registration labels for most heavy vehicles as agreed by the Transport and Infrastructure Council. It also provides for the national ly developed Load Restraint Guide for Light Vehicles 2018, published by the National Transport Commission to apply to light vehicles carrying loads. It also provides for the repeal of the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 ( Cwth) which will be complete on 1 July 2019. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 4 - SUPPORT A SAFE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITY LPP contributes to the safety of the ACT community by providing the framework for an effective and continuously improving justice system. It provides legislative and policy advice on issues including corrections and sentencing, drugs and firearms regulation, child sex offenders, and liquor, racing and gaming. LPP examines and analyses crime indicators to measure the success of legislative and policy approaches to criminal justice issues. In addition, it administers Government programs and strategies targeting road safety awareness, high-density housing and safety, home safety and property crime reduction. LPP also supports the Government's commitment to community safety by developing justice reinvestment approaches and assisting to set performance measures for ACT Policing through the Purchase Agreement for policing services in the ACT. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 44 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Justice Reinvestment LPP continued to progress the Justice Reinvestment (JR) Strategy throughout 2017 -18. Justice Reinvestment is about developing a smarter, more cost-effective approach to improving criminal justice outcomes by reducing crime, improving public safety and strengthening communities. Over 2017 -18 a number of JR projects, developed through extensive consultation and data gathering, have been delivered or are continuing to be progressed. These include: progressing and evaluating the Yarrabi Bamirr - JR Family Tr ial commencement of the Ngurrambai- Bail Support Trial completion of phase 1 analysis of the ACT Justice Services and Programs Map completion of a foundational ACT Justice System costing model completion of two ACT Justice and Human Services data snapshots continued progress on Evaluations - under the JR Framework development of an options paper on financial pathways of reinvestment development of a two day JR and Reducing Recidivism Forum and managing and promoting the High Density Housing Program. A JR Strategy, developed over the last four years, supports the commitment in the 9th Parliamentary Agreement to reduce recidivism by 25% by 2025. LPP will continue to work across government and with the community sector to use the ACT JR approach to underpin a plan to reduce recidivism. The Strategy is expected to be available in the second half of 2018. High Density Housing Safety and Security Program The High Density Housing Community and Safety Program (the Program), operating since 2008, is a collaborative ef fort between the directorate, ACT Housing, ACT Health, ACT Policing and delivered by Reclink Australia Inc. The Program is recognised as a practical example of placed-based justice reinvestment in action, reduces contact with the criminal justice system, increases community safety and builds community connectedness. The Australian Institute Criminology (AIC) publically released it's an evaluation of the Program in May 2018. The AIC's evaluation concluded that the Program met its objectives, effectively demonstrating the benefits of implementing community development approaches and facilitating access to services that reduce or prevent crime in public housing areas. In particular, the evaluation demonstrated the program's effectiveness in: reducing the occurr ence of violent crime by 50% reducing the occurrence of property crime by 60% reducing the occurrence of disturbance incidents by 49% reducing crime by a realised saving of police time to government of at least $0.42 to $0.51 for every $1 invested increasing the level of social cohesion among residents The ACT Government is exploring the expansion of the program to another public housing site in the ACT. It provided funding in 2018-19 to extend and expand the program at public housing sites in the ACT. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 45 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Yarr abi Bamirr - Justice Reinvestment Bamirr (meaning 'walk tall' in the Ngunnawal language) was officially launched at Winnunga Aboriginal Health and Community Services in April 2017. More information can be found in Section B.1 Organisational Overview. Ngurrambai - Bail Support Trial The Bail Support Trial, Ngurrambai (meaning 'perceive - I see, I hear, I understand' in Ngunnawal), was launched with the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS) on 7 December 2017. More information can be found in Section B.1 Organisational Overview. ACT Justice Services and Programs Map The ACT Justice Services and Programs Map aimed to create an evidence base of government and community sector programs and services that support people (adults and juveniles) who have contact, or are at risk of having contact, with the ACT criminal justice system (including victims of crime and perpetrators of crime). Nous Group Consultancy provided a first phase analysis of 56 government and community programs. ACT Justice and Human Services System data snapshots The two data snapshots are a key part of the evidence base for the ACT Justice Reinvestment Strategy. They provide local data to local people so they can develop local solutions that change people's contact with the justice system. The first data snapshot is about all ACT citizens. The second specifically presents data about ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The development of the ACT data snapshots provided an opportunity for representatives across the community, government and academic sectors to consider what data provides an insight into the experience of vulnerable ACT citizens. It is anticipated that the snapshots will be finalised in 2018. ACT Justice System Costing model The ACT Justice System Cost Model is also part of the ACT specific evidence base under the Justice Reinvestment Strategy. It is an innovative system-wide app roach to costing the ACT's justice system from the point of apprehension to detention. The Cost Model can demonstrate the impact of a change in one part of the system and how that flows through and impacts another part of the justice system. The Cost Model supports evidenced based decision making by: assisting to understand the costs associated with the ACT adult and youth justice system, and understanding the potential impacts of policy, program, and operational decisions within the justice system on the c ost effectiveness of service delivery and broader crime prevention outcomes for the community. A function of the Cost Model is to project costs into the future to 2025-26. This will help to inform the development of a plan to reduce recidivism by 25% by 20 25. Reducing Recidivism by 25% by 2025 The Justice Reinvestment Strategy is now being transitioned to an approach which will underpin the commitment in the 9th Parliamentary Agreement to reduce recidivism by 25% by 2025. A Literature Review to inform the plan for reducing recidivism will be released in the 2018- 19 financial year. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 46 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Liquor policy After several years of review and liquor policy reform, the focus for LPP and the industry in 2017- 18 has moved to implementation. Access Canberra and industry are adapting to these red tape reduction and community safety regulatory changes. Through the Justice and Community Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2017 (No.3) , the membership provisions of the Liquor Advisory Board in the Liquor Ac t 2010 were amended. These changes comprised the membership category of representing ClubsACT being broadened to representing club licensees and the Australian Hotels Association (ACT branch) broadened to representing on-licensees. An additional stakeholde r representing the late night economy was also included in the Liquor Advisory Board membership. LPP continued to participate in the CBR NightCrew Steering Committee which oversaw the trial, delivered by St John Ambulance, which supports vulnerable people in Canberra City's nightlife precinct to stay safe on Friday and Saturday nights between 10pm - 4am. In the 2018 -19 Budget, the Government extended and expanded the trial for a further four years, including Thursday nights, and provided for two staff identifying as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, based on the impact the trial has had supporting people out in the city. Gaming policy During the 2017 -18 financial year, consistent with commitments in the Parliamentary Agreement for the 9th Legislative Assembly for the ACT , LPP has been continuing to review and develop policy aiming to reduce harm from gaming. Achievements in this space include the implementation of the Gaming Machine (Cash Facilities) Amendment Act 2017 , which restricts EFTPOS cash withdrawals in clubs to $200 per transaction, with all stages of the transaction requiring human interaction with a trained staff member, and the passage of Casino and Other Gaming Legislation Amendment Act 2018. That Act establishes independent Casino Advisory Panels to provide advice to the Minister on a range of key decisions about the casino, provides that strict harm minimisation measures for casino gaming machines cannot be circumvented, and establishes the requirements for any Social Impact Assessment undertaken by the casino licensee. LPP facilitated a number of round table discussions with a wide range of stakeholders to explore how harm reduction measures could be effectively developed in the Territory. The views of these stakeholders will be considered in the development of future policy reform. LPP also managed the Government's community clubs grants which were made available to small and medium clubs and club groups with a gross gaming machine revenue of under $4 million per annum. LPP developed the Gaming Machine Amendment Act 2017 , which improves the community's access to Social Impact Assessments, and provides support to small and medium clubs and club groups through a 50% gaming machine taxation rebate and reduced administrative burden through quart erly tax returns and payments. LPP also undertook a significant project to establish, through the Casino (Electronic Gaming) Act 2017, the legislative framework for the introduction of electronic gaming products in the casino, subject to a redevelopment of the casino and the establishment of a casino precinct. This framework is proponent-neutral and applies to the current Aquis Entertainment redevelopment proposal or any future proposal. The framework includes strong harm minimisation requirements, includin g a $2 maximum bet limit and mandatory pre-commitment for casino gaming machines, and the requirement for a centralised monitoring system. Some of LPP's other work relating to gaming policy included: Justice and Community Safety Directorate 47 Annual Report 2017 -2018 policy development to reduce the number of gaming machin e authorisations in the ACT to 4,000 by June 2020, including Secretariat support for the Club Industry Diversification Support Analysis ongoing contributions to whole -of-government work in considering Aquis Entertainment's redevelopment proposal for Casino Canberra, and participation in a National Taskforce on illegal offshore wagering. Racing policy The Parliamentary Agreement for the 9th Legislative Assembly for the ACT includes a commitment to end Government funding for greyhound racing at the expiry of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the ACT's thoroughbred and harness racing clubs, and take active steps to transition to end the operation of greyhound racing in the ACT. During the year the ACT became the first jurisdiction in Australia to prohibit the racing and trialling of greyhounds in response to the documented and acknowledged animal welfare failures in the greyhound racing industry in NSW. The directorate contributed to the development of the necessary legislative reforms to give effect to this ban, which included the Racing (Greyhounds) Amendment Act 2017 and the Domestic Animals (Racing Greyhounds) Amendment Act 2017 . Following signing of a new five year MOU with the ACT's thoroughbred and harness racing clubs, LPP has established and provided secretariat support for the Joint Racing Industry and Government Committee, which has a focus on the development and sustainability of racing in the ACT. ACT Road Safety Strategy 2011 -2020 LPP is responsible for coordinating, monitoring and reporting on the ACT Road Safety Strategy 2011 -20 (the Strategy) and its supporting action plans that provide the policy framework for addressing road safety issues in the ACT. The Strategy is based on the Vision Zero philosophy and the Safe Syste ms approach, where efforts must be made to design, construct and manage the road transport system in a way that when road users make mistakes, their mistakes do not result in death or serious injury. The goals of the Strategy are to contribute to a national reduction of at least 30% in the annual number of fatalities and serious injuries by 2020, develop a community that shares the responsibility for road safety and develop an approach to road safety that involves all stakeholders working together to improve road safety. In 2017 -18, LPP delivered a number of initiatives to support the Strategy including: an ACT Road Safety Forum focusing on ways to achieve 'Vision Zero' in the ACT through a 'safe systems' approach to road network planning , design and maintenance a social media campaign on the requirement to report, and how to report, all crashes in the ACT, including the distribution of flyers via electronic registration renewal notices a joint partnership and campaign with the Australian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) to raise awareness and provide information about the safety benefits of newer cars to young and older drivers a new instalment of the Share the Road campaign to raise public awareness and educate road users on how to better share the road with buses the annual ACT Road Safety Fund grants program promoting National Road Safety Week in partnership with ACT ESA, ACT Policing and the Canberra Raiders. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 48 Annual Report 2017 -2018 LPP developed the ACT Road Safety Report Card (the Report) which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly in February 2018. The report included performance data and information on key programs and other initiatives delivered or developed in 2017-18. One of the strategic indicators included in this report is the number of road deaths per 100,000 population. The graph below compares ACT figures with national figures to the end of December 2017, showing that while the ACT performs quite well when compared to other jurisdictions, there is still some work to be done to achieve Vision Zero. Figure 5 Annual number of road fatalities per 100,000 populations Source: Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (December 2017). The annual number of road fatalities per 100,000 population allows jurisdictions to compare the road safety performance of their state and territory and is used at the national level to monitor road safety performance. National Road Safety Week 2018 National Road Safety Week (NRSW) is held annually in May to promote safer driving and raise awareness of road safety. The campaign is an initiative of Safer Australian Roads and Highways (SARAH) which was established by Mr Peter Frazer after his daughter was killed in a road crash on the Hume Highway in February 2012. The theme this year focused on protecting every life. In 2017 -18, the directorate coordinated a partnership to promote NRSW with the Transport Canberra and City Services (TCCS) Directorate, ESA, ACT Policing and the Canberra Raiders. the directorate organ ised Canberra International Airport, the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House, the National Carillion, Kings Avenue overpass, Questacon, Ian Potter Foundation Technology Learning Centre and the Royal Australian Mint to be illuminated yell ow at night for the week TCCS provided four NRSW themed bus backs on ACTION Buses and promoted the week on its social media channels the directorate organised a match day partnership with the Canberra Raiders on Saturday 5 May at GIO Stadium, with NRSW having all naming rights for that match. This included all Raiders coaching staff and mascots wearing yellow lapel pins on match day, and all TV, radio and social media promotion of the week for seven days prior to the game. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 49 Annual Report 2017 -2018 A photo shoot with Canberra Raider s, ACT Policing and ESA staff for use on bus backs and social media. ACT Policing organised a display of emergency vehicles in partnership with ESA in the forecourt of GIO Stadium prior to the Canberra Raiders match. All ACT Policing, ACTION Buses and ESA operational staff wore yellow lapel pins, and all operational vehicles attached a yellow ribbon. Figure 6 National Road Safety Week 2018 National Road Safety Week Figure 7 National Road Safety Week 2018 National Road Safety Week Justice and Community Safety Directorate 50 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ACT Road Safety Fund grants program The ACT Road Safety Fund (the Fund) was established to support the ACT Road Safety Strategy by funding projects and initiatives relating to road safety research and education and road trauma prevention. The Fund is resourced by the road safety contribution levied on ACT vehicle registrations. The contribution of $2.50 per vehicle generates approximately $700,000 each year. The Road Safety Fund Advisory Board (the Board) was appointed in 2015 to provide advice to the Road Safety Minister about the application of the fund, including the delivery of a road safety grants program. The Board is a non-statutory body, comprising an ACT Government executive as chair, nominees of ACT Comprehensive Third Party insurers and road user representatives and road safety experts. In December 2017, the Road Safety Minister announced the recipients of the second round of the ACT Road Safety Fund grants program. The fund provided funding of $380,000 to seven innovativ e projects across the areas of research, training, education and awareness programs. The successful ACT Road Safety Fund Community Grant recipients for 2017 were: the Centre for Automotive Safety Research (The University of Adelaide) the University of Melb ourne the Traffic Management Association of Australia Road Safety Education Limited Stay Upright Rider Training Kidsafe ACT the Aboriginal Legal Service. Legislative Amendments During 2017 -18, LPP assisted the Government in the development, explanation and implementation of legislation relevant to providing an effective and continuously improving justice system. Examples include: The Crimes (Fortification Removal) Amendment Act 2018 introduced changes to provide the Chief Police Officer with the power to apply to the Magistrates Court for an order that the occupier of a premises remove fortifications on the premises. It also prohibits the establishment of fortifications on certain premises The Crimes (Police Powers and Firearms Offence) Amendment Act 2017 introduced statutory crime scene powers to allow police officers to preserve evidence in a timely manner at crime scenes both in public and private places while taking the least restrictive approach to limiting a person's right to privacy. It also created a new offence of 'drive by shooting' which deals with people shooting at a building, including a home, whether form a car or otherwise. The offence is punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment The Crimes (Food or Drink Spiking) Amendment Act 2017 crea ted new offences to criminalise and deter food or drink spiking. These offences are punishable by a maximum of five years imprisonment, fines of up to $75,000, or both The Crimes (Intimate Image Abuse) Amendment Act 2017 commenced on 30 August 2017. The Ac t amended the Crimes Act 1900 to criminalise the distribution of intimate images without consent and threats to capture or distribute intimate images. The Act includes a separate offence with an increased penalty for sharing intimate images of children and young people under 16 years to third Justice and Community Safety Directorate 51 Annual Report 2017 -2018 parties. The new offences cover scenarios that have largely emerged due to advances in technology The Firearms and Prohibited Weapons Legislation Amendment Act 2018 commenced in phases on 1 March 2018 and 1 April 2018. The Act made a range of amendments to improve the operations of firearms and prohibited weapons legislation. The amendments include: o clarifying that a firearms instructor can lawfully use a firearm belonging to a friend or relative of the student while demonstrating to that student the proper and safe use of a firearm o allowing the Firearms Registrar to withhold the reasons for refusing to issue a firearms licence where to do so would reveal security sensitive information o allowing the Firearms Registrar to issue a category C composite entity licence to the owner or operator of a zoo, for the management of animals o allowing the registrar to issue a permit authorising the use of suppressors under certain prescribed circumstances o prohibiting possession of an article with a blade or spike that is disguised as an article that does not look like a weapon, for example a credit card knife o providing that a centre -file rifle magazine (other than a self -loading rifle magazine) with a capacity of more than 10 rounds is a prohibited article o providing a new definition of body armour to align with the national definition used for customs purposes, and o Inserting an additional description of a prohibited blended weapon. The remaining provisions relating to storage of firearms commenced on 1 September 2018. The Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 2018 commenced operation on 2 March 2018. The Act made amendments to a number of pieces of criminal law legislation to address issues that had been highlighted as requiring law reform and implemented a number of recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in its final Criminal Justice Report published on 14 August 2017. The amendments include: o enabling repeated but largely indistinguishable occasions of child sexual abuse to be charged effectively by amending section 56 of the Crimes Act 1900 (Crimes Act) so that the unlawful sexual relationship, rather than individual sexual acts, constitutes the actus reus for the offence of maintaining a sexual relationship with a young person or a person under special care. This aligned with a recommendation made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (Royal Commission) o creating two new grooming offences in the Crimes A ct to criminalise the non - electronic grooming of a child and grooming of persons other than a child, in accordance with two recommendations made by the Royal Commission o excluding good character as a mitigating factor in sentencing for child sexual abuse offences where that good character 'enabled' the offending behaviour o ensuring that an offender cannot be concurrently subject to a good behaviour order and a parole order to resolve potential constitutional uncertainty and practical difficulties between two parts of a combination sentence running simultaneously, with one administered by the judicial branch of government and one administered by the executive branch o extending the jurisdiction of the Childrens ' Court to allow circle sentencing to occur for Abori ginal and Torres Strait Islander children and creating a new court called the Warrumbul Court (Childrens' Court Sentencing Court). This gives the Justice and Community Safety Directorate 52 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community an opportunity to work collaboratively with the ACT criminal justice system to address over representation issues and offending behaviour, and o clarifying that a person can commit the offence of incitement if the person urges another person to aid, abet, counsel, procure, be knowingly concerned i n or a party to, the commission of an offence by someone else; to clarify that a person may be found guilty of incitement whether or not the offence incited was actually committed. This was required to address an issue identified by the High Court of Austr alia and closes the gap on the ability to prosecute crimes where the instigator takes care to distance himself or herself from the criminal activity, as well as crimes proposed at the top levels of criminal organisations utilising more sophisticated means.

To safeguard the interests of the Territory as a whole, the ACTGS requires a unique breadth of technical legal expertise to support municipal, state and federal administration. The ACTGS provides legal advice and representation to the ACT Government across the full spectrum of government, commercial, litigation and administrative law matters through its three operational sections of: government law - advice on systems of government and all government functions and responsibilities and litigation regarding administrative law and regulatory functions property and commercial - commercial matters, procurement, land and property civil litigation - civil and commercial claims against the Territory. Together with the Office of the Solic itor-General, the operational sections of the ACTGS support the Attorney-General as the first Law Officer of the Territory by ensuring that the Government has high- quality legal and related services that protect the Territory's interests. The Law Officers (General) Legal Services Directions 2012 (t he Legal Services Directions) sets out the manner in which Territory legal work must be performed and includes the obligation to act as a model litigant more particularly set out in the Law Officers (Model Litigant) Guidelines 2010.

Justice and Community Safety Directorate 55 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Public and Constitutional Law ACTGS continued to provide advice to the Attorney-General and Territory agencies on a wide range of public and constitutional law matters. These areas of law often involve essential aspects with implications for government which can have enduring and/or broader ranging implications which extend beyond the interests of a particular directorate. The ACTGS represented either the Territory, Territory entities or the Attorney-General in a number of significant cases including: In late 2017, cases were commenced in the Supreme Court and the Federal Court by the Canberra Greyhound Racing Club (the Club) challenging the Territory's decision to ban greyhound racing in the ACT. The orders sought are to compel the Planning and Land Authority to issue the Club a new lease in relation to the land for its racing track. The application was refused on discretionary grounds at first instance ( Canberra Greyhound Racing Club Inc v Planning and Land Authority of the ACT [2018] ACTSC per Murrell C J) and is now before the ACT Court of Appeal. In the Federal Court, the Club seeks damages for breach of its lease and declarations that certain Territory laws are invalid on the basis they acquire property from the Club other than on just terms A matter w hich was commenced in 2013 involving a citizen that had been sentenced to periodic detention in 2008 and then placed in full -time detention in 2009 was concluded during the year. In 2013, the ACT Supreme Court set aside the Sentence Administration Board 's 2008 decision to cancel the citizen's periodic detention. The Board's decision had resulted in the citizen's full -time detention. In view of the Board's decision having been set aside, the citizen made a claim for fals e imprisonment and human right breaches for the time served in full -time detention. The Court found that he was falsely imprisoned, but that no cause of action was available for compensation under the Human Rights Act 2004 . The Supreme Court awarded the ci tizen nominal damages of $1. The Supreme Court found that even if the citizen been given the opportunity to decide whether or not to attend the Board's 2008 hearing and had he chosen to attend, there was nothing he could have said that would have led to an outcome other than the Board deciding to cancel his periodic detention and his subsequent full -time detention. An application for leave to appeal out of time has been made. Human Rights The ACTGS provided legal advice and representation to agencies on the interpretation and application of the Human Rights Act 2004 (HR Act). The HR Act expresses a number of rights drawn from international rights instruments, including the right to privacy of the home, the right to humane treatment when deprived of liberty, the right to equality, the right to fair trial and the rights regarding unlawful imprisonment and wrongful conviction. It applies those rights to the interpretation of Territory laws, to the exercise of powers and functions by Territory public authorities and, in those respects, to the conduct of legal proceedings in the Territory. The ACTGS continues to advise the Attorney-General in relation to notices given under section 34 of the HR Act of matters in the Supreme Court to which the Territory is not a party, but which involve the application of the HR Act or which may involve the making of a declaration of incompatibility under the HR Act. The Attorney-General has a right to intervene in any such proceeding under section 35 of the HR Act. The ACTGS assists the Attorney-General to discharge his role under the HR Act not only by formal intervention in the proceeding but also by promoting a proper articulation of human rights matters by the moving party and by assisting the responding party to address those matters in their submissions. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 56 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Issues under the HR Act arise in a range of areas including detainees, discrimination, mental health and housing.

The Solicitor -General appears in proceedings on the Attor ney-General's behalf and for the Territory in the Supreme Court and High Court. Where required, he also appears and advises on a wide range of matters including constitutional, human rights, public law and other sensitive litigation. This includes briefing the Attorney -General on notices served under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) (Judiciary Act). Section 78B of the Judiciary Act requires parties in court proceedings raising constitutional issues to give the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth, States and self-governing Territories a notice of the constitutional issues (s 78B notice). Each Attorney-General then makes a decision whether to intervene in the proceedings under s 78A of the Judiciary Act. During the year, numerous s 78B notices were considered and the Attorney- General intervened in only one matter. The Solicitor -General also represents the Attorney-General in legal proceedings in which he intervenes to make submissions on points of law under s 27 of the C ourt Procedures Act 2004 and s 35 of the Human Rights Act 2004, and has represented the Territory and Minister in judicial review proceedings. The Attorney -General intervened in a commercial dispute involving Denham Constructions Pty Ltd v Islamic Republic of Pakistan in the ACT Supreme Court in order to ensure proper arguments were put, first, in relation to the application of the Building and Construction Industry (Security of Payment) Act 2009 on National Land in the ACT on which Pakistan's High Commission is located and, secondly, upon the accepted field of operation of s 52(i) of the Commonwealth Constitution , which provides the Commonwealth Parliament with exclusive powers over the seat of government. The ACT Supreme Court found in favour of the conventional arguments advanced by the A CT Attorney - General in relation to both issues, with no departure from settled principle. In early 2017, the Attorney-General intervened in ACT Court of Appeal proceedings involving the application of Territory laws on Aboriginal land in the Jervis Bay Territory. The matter arises from a landlord and tenant dispute, which the tenant has asked the ACAT to resolve in its residential Justice and Community Safety Directorate 61 Annual Report 2017 -2018 tenancies jurisdiction. In 2015, the ACAT determined it has jurisdiction in relation to the dispute. The landlord subsequently argued unsuccessfully in the Supreme Court and then successfully in the ACT Court of Appeal that the Territory's residential tenancies law does not apply to the dispute. In early 2018, the High Court granted the tenant special leave to appeal. The Attorney -General is a party to the High Court appeal and supports the position that the Territory's residential tenancies law is applicable to the dispute between the other parties. The Attorney -General also intervened in novel proceedings presently be fore the Supreme Court seeking a review of a Coroner's findings under s 93 of the Coroners Act 1997. The Solicitor -General continues to participate in meetings of the Special Committee of Solicitors- General (the Committee) which reports to the Standing Council on Law and Justice (formerly the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General). The Committee meets regularly to review current constitutional cases across all Australian jurisdictions and consider issues referred to it or which arise and warrant consideration by the Committee on its own motion. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 62 Annual Report 2017 -2018 B.2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - OUTPUT 1.3 PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL'S OFFICE Output Description The Parliamentary Counsel's Office (PCO ) is responsible for the provision of high quality and timely legislative dr afting and publishing services for ACT legislation and maintenance of the ACT legislation register. Strategic Objectives Priorities and Performance The PCO contributes to the directorate's strategic objectives by virtue of its supporting role. However, more broadly the PCO 's objectives are to draft and publish legislation for the Government in accordance with its legislation program and for individual members of the Legislative Assembly and the courts , ensuring that: ACT laws give effect to their intended policy objectives, and assist in compliance and efficient administration ACT laws are legally, including constitutionally, valid, and can withstand vigorous scrutiny ACT laws are clear and simple, reflecting best-practice drafting ACT laws form a cohesive statute book of the highest standard new ACT legislation and other legislative material (for example, bills and explanatory statements) are notified efficiently on the ACT legislation register ACT legislation, as originally made and as in force from time to time, is readily accessible, particularly on the ACT legislation register comprehensive ACT legislative material and information are readily accessible, particularly on the ACT legislation register.

In 2017 -18, the PC O also prepared a number of bills on instruction from private members of the Legislative Assembly, with 9 bills presented in the Assembly. In 2017 -18, PCO also prepared a number of bills on instruction from private members of the Legislative Assembly, with the following 9 bills being presented in the Assembly: Crimes (Invasion of Privacy) Amendment Bill 2017 Crimes (Criminal Organisation Control) Amendment Bill 2017 Government Procurement (Financial Integrity) Amendment Bill 2017 Domestic Animals (Dangerous Dogs) Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 Health (Improving Abortion Access) Amendment Bill 2018 Crimes (Consent) Amendment Bill 2018 Magistrates Court (Retirement Age of Magistrates) Amendment Bill 2018 Anti-corruption and Integrity Commission Bill 2018. Technical Amendments Program The PCO continues to maintain the technical amendments program which provides for amendments that are minor or technical, and non-controversial, to be dealt with through a regular program of Justice and Community Safety Directorate 64 Annual Report 2017 -2018 statute law amendment bills. The program enables minor amendments that would not justify separate bills to be dealt with in an efficient and timely way. It also serves the important purpose of improving the overall quality of the ACT statute book by keeping our laws up- to-date and easy to find, read and understand. In 2017 -18, a statute law amendment bill was presented to the Assembly in August 2017. Training In 2017, the PCO released two new guides about ACT legislation: ACT Legislation: Legislati on Basics This guide sets out the basics about ACT legislation, for example, where the ACT derives its lawmaking power, what laws apply in the ACT and what are the different kinds of ACT legislation. ACT Legislation \u2014Reading Legislation This guide explains how to navigate, read and understand ACT legislation. It describes the typical structure of ACT legislation, explains common provisions and identifies interpretation principles and aids. The guides are available on the PCO website www.pco.act.gov.au . The PCO has revised its training program to ACT public servants about understanding ACT legislation to accompany the guides, called 'Caught in the Act'. In the 2017 -18 financial year, the PC O conducted seven regular training sessions for ACT public servants, two sessions for graduates and a tailored session for the Road Transport Authority. In total, the PCO delivered training to approximately 150 public servants during 2017- 18. Republications The PCO follows a strict point- in-time publishing policy so that an up- to-date, authorised version of each amended Act or subordinate law is republished on the day the amendment commences. The PCO places high importance on the currency of republications made available to users on the ACT legislation register . During 2017 -18, new versions of amended legislation were made available to users on the day the versions became effective in the form of 425 s eparate republications. Notifications Under the Legislation Act 2001 , the making of all ACT Acts, subordinate laws, disallowable instruments, notifiable instruments, approved forms and commencement notices must be electronically notified and an authorised version of the text of the law or instrument published on the ACT legislation register. The PCO notified 1,236 newly -made Acts, subordinate laws and other instruments (including explanatory statements) during 20 17-18. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 65 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ACT Legislation Register During 2017 -18, the ACT legislation register website usage remained consistent with last year. The number of hits and requests on the website (hits that successfully retrieve content) have remained in the same range as last year. Figure 8 ACT Legislation Register Usage ACT Legislation Register Replacement Project During 2017 -18, the PCO continued a project to provide for the replacement of the ACT legisla tion register and its supporting systems. The register and website systems are more than 15 years old, and are a sophisticated set of interrelated systems that support the drafting, notification, republication and repeal of ACT legislation. The project will ensure critical services provided by this system continue to be provided and that the technology platform used to deliver these services is sustainable. In addition, a range of features will align the register with user needs including modern search capabilities, compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, the ability for users to subscribe to alerts when content changes and compatibility with mobile devices. The project is divided into three phases with expected completion in 2019- 20. This financial year PCO focussed on development and implementation of the new legislation register website and its internal database. Various process efficiencies will be realised for PCO staff maintaining the website as well as improved functionality for website users. Next financial year PCO will develop and implement the subscription service on the new website. Backcapture The PCO continues to add superseded point- in-time republications of ACT Acts and subordinate laws to the ACT legislation register. During 2017-18, the PCO added 38 backcapture republications to the register. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 66 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Office Performance \u2014 Client Satisfaction The PCO conducted three client satisfaction surveys in April 2018 \u2014a legislation register survey, a notification service survey and a legislative drafting service survey \u2014targeting its main client groups. Overall, 89% of clients were satisfied with the legislative drafting and publishing services provided by the PCO. The main outcomes for each survey are outlined below: ACT Legislation Register Survey 86% of respondents rated the overall service provided by the register as excellent/good respondents commented that they liked how easy it is to navigate the register, that it is very user friendly and always up- to-date many respondents would like an alert service for new legislation and changes to legislation. Figure 9 ACT Legislation Register Survey Results Notification Service Survey 100% of respondents rated the overall notifications service provided by the PCO as excellent/good 100% of respondents rated the timeliness of the PCO 's notification services as excellent/good 100% of respondents ind icated they have an excellent/good working relationship with PCO staff.

Justice and Community Safety Directorate 67 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The results of the surveys, including the comments and suggestions, will help inform priorities for development and improvement in the coming financial year. The PCO will also continue to work hard to preserve the important things that survey respondents have identified as highly valued in our working relationships and service. Office Performance - Timeliness The PCO exceeded its performance targets for timely work in 2017- 18. The PCO's timeliness performance indicators measure the timeliness of legislative drafting and publication services.

Strategic Objectives Priorities and Performance Strategic Objective 2 - Safe Community An effective criminal justice system underpins the safety of the community. Although neither the directorate nor the ACT Government can control all of the factors that impact on community safety, effectiveness can be measured by examining the level of crime against people and property and whether the justice system deals with offenders in a way that reduces the risk of further offending. ACTCS is an integral part of the criminal justice system. ACTCS' invol vement with an offender commences once the court has made an order around custody or supervision. The diagram below provides a basic overview of an offender's interaction with ACTCS. It does not provide visibility of the administrative or operational processes associated with offender management. Figure 10 Offender Pathway Justice and Community Safety Directorate 73 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Functional Overview The Executive Director of ACTCS manages all executive functions of the agency, incorporating both operational and corporate areas. Operationally, the Executive Director is assisted by two General Managers: the General Manager, Custodial Operations, responsible for the AMC and the Court Transport Unit (CTU) the General Manager Community Corrections and Release Planning, responsible for Communit y Corrections, Programs and Reintegration and Sentence Management. The corporate areas enable the organisation in its service delivery through the provision of functions associated with workforce development and training, policy and ministerial support ser vices, compliance and assurance, and financial management. ACTCS also works closely with other functions of the directorate on whole of directorate and whole of government matters. During the year, the Executive Director undertook a functional re-alignment which resulted in the creation of a number of senior management positions focused on service delivery and enhancing ACTCS' capability these positions include the Head of Sentence Management Head of Programs and Reintegration Head of Accommodation at the A MC Head of Security at the AMC Manager Intelligence and Integrity In addition, during 2018-19 ACTCS will also welcome a newly appointed Deputy General Manger Custodial Operations. Achievements ACTCS delivered on a range of key priorities during 2017- 18: developed the ACT Corrective Services Strategic Plan 2017- 2019 (Resetting the Foundations) implemented an executive and senior management structure to delivery on key priorities set out in the Strategic Plan developed the ACTCS Rehabilitation Framework which is expected to be published during the first half of 2018 -19 relocated the female detainees into new accommodation to meet the increase in the number of female detainees continued to build strong working relationships with key stakeholders such as ACT Health, ACT Policing and Winnunga Nimmityjah. Some of these achievements are described in more detail throughout this section. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 74 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Strengthening Foundations Rehabilitation Framework The newly developed Rehabilitation Framework (the Framework) provides the theoretical foundation to support the sentence management continuum and related programs across Custodial Operations and Community Corrections. The Framework is based on the Risk Need Responsivity model (RNR) and the Therapeutic Jurisprudence (TJ) model. The RNR model addresses community safety by managing risk factors for re-offending. This includes employing cognitive behavioural and cognitive social learning strategies to address risks and encourage and reinforce pro-social behaviour. The TJ model highlights th e importance of correctional staff engaging offenders in ways that are perceived to be fair, encourage respect for the justice system and the law, and that promote rehabilitation. This combined approach ensures risk management and community safety objectiv es are met, while at the same time upholding the human rights of detainees and offenders. The model will underpin detainee/offender sentence plans. Under the new Framework, rehabilitative programs and activities will be delivered and adapted to accommodate a range of learning styles, as well as being responsive to multiple and complex needs including gender, cultural, language, mental health and disability needs. Figure 11 New Framework Policies, Procedures and Intranet In 2017 -18, a project commenced reviewing and updating AMC policies and operating procedures, including Executive Director and General Manager Instructions. Policies and operating procedures are being updated according to priorities and risk and will reflect best practice for corrections in the ACT. Numerous reviews have been conducted on various areas of ACTCS, leading to a large number of recommendations, many have required amendments to existing policy or the development of new policy to maintain the focus on cont inuous improvement. All approved policies and operating procedures (and associated documents) are communicated to staff by the Executive Director, with the documents stored and available to staff on the ACTCS SharePoint website. Policies and operating procedures made under the Corrections Management Act 2007 are notifiable instruments and will be available to the public on the ACT Legislation Register; however, due to operational security some are restricted and are not available to the public. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 75 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Enhancing Intelligence and Security Capability In 2017 -18, The ACT Government provided budget funding to enhance the intelligence capacity of ACTCS and the security and good order of the AMC. In light of this funding, ACTCS established the Intelligence and Integrity Unit, strengthening its overarching intelligence capability. A key focus of the unit is enhancing the intelligence gathering and analytical capacity across the Agency, with a robust intelligence framework contributing to the safety of the community, staff, detainees and clients. With the establishment of this capability, ACTCS is better positioned to proactively identify and respond to strategic and operational risks, ensuring all areas of the Agency are intelligence-informed and risk-based. A holistic approach to intelligence management, supporting both Custodial Operations and Community Corrections, complements physical and dynamic security processes and is integral in identifying emerging issues or trends across the Agency. A Head of Security has been engaged at the AMC since December 2017. The Head of Security has overseen the formation of a security team at the AMC integrating the existing functions of Intelligence and the Canine Unit, creating a more robust response to, and support for, dynamic security practice and the embedding of security processes at the AMC. ACTCS is enhancing its operations at the AMC through the development of an Emergency Management Framework, Security Operations Model and Security Strategy. These frameworks will provide governance around emergency management, barrier management, and procedural and dynamic security practices. First National Corrections Day On 19 January 2018, ACTCS celebrated National Corrections Day for the first time. National Corrections Day is an important initiative that started in NSW last year and was adopted in 2018 by all jurisdictions across Australia and New Zealand. National Corrections Day formally recognises the valuable contribution ACTCS staff make to the wider ACT Community. This year the families of all ACTCS staff and key partners were invited to attend the AMC for an afternoon celebration that included lunch, games and tours of the centre. This was an excellent opportunity for our families and community to learn about our unique facility and the work that goes on behind the scenes. The Minister for Corrections also attended and opened the proceedings following the 'Welcome to Country' delivered by Aunty Violet. The day was a great success with approximately 150 people attending. The facility tour was popular, providing an opportunity for people to gain a greater insight into how the centre is run and the many services that are provided both in custody and in the community to rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders. The event was extremely positive, with efforts from all business units of ACTCS. It was a true example of the strong teamwork that is the foundation of our work. We look forward to continuing the celebration in 2019, and recognising the efforts of our employees and showcase the unique and skilled work throughout the year. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 76 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Alexander Maconochie Centre The AMC became operational in 2009 and is the ACT's primary adult correctional centre. The AMC caters for the full-time custody of male and female, remand and sentenced detainees of all security classifications in a secure and safe environment. The AMC is a campus-style correctional centre comprising of freestanding buildings both within and outside of the perimeter fence, occupying a total area of approximately 60 hectares. The area within the perimeter is divided into precincts or zones, with both remand and sentenced detainee accommodation of two types - cottage units and cells. In the cottages, detainees are able to participate fully in the running of their unit, including meal preparation and laundry. The internal perimeter also houses the Hume Health Centre, women's accommodation and the Management Unit. The Transitional Release Centre and staff training facility and amenities are outside the perimeter fence. The core focus for the AMC Senior Management Team has been continual improvement in line with the ACTCS Strategic Plan. Average daily detainee numbers Average daily numbers have risen from 342 in 2014- 15, 402 in 2015 -16, 445 in 2016 -17 and 474 in 2017 -18. The AMC reached a population peak of 507 detainees on 19 and 25 June 2018. In late 2017, the number of female detainees increased beyond the capacity of the Women's Cottages and therefore the women detainees were relocated to the Special Care Centre (SCC). Work continues to review and install additional beds across the centre with a number of areas being identified for additional beds. ACTCS is continuing to look at various strategies to address the increasing detainee population in consultation with Government.

There was also an increase of detainees returning to corrective services. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 78 Annual Report 2017 -2018 There was a decrease in the number of offenders discharged from community corrections orders returning to either custody or community service. The tables below provide the rates of return for detainees and offenders. It needs to be recognised that the data provided is based on two years earlier than the current reporting period, therefore allowing detainees and offenders two full years in which to return. This is consistent with Report on Government Services reporting. While there are many drivers for recidivism including access to health, housing and employment, as well as police and court practice, the Extended Throughcare Program (the Program) continues to work with detainees to address their reintegration needs. Following a review of the Program in 2017, changes were made to the eligibility criteria for the Program in April 2018. These changes have allowed ACTCS to appropriately target clients who are in most need of support by setting a lower eligibility point for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander clients and extending the program to male and female remand and sentenced detainees. Further information on the Extended Throughcare program can be found in this report. Table 14 ACT detainees released who returned to prison under sentence within two years (as a percentage).

The demand for accommodation for women, either remanded in custody or serving custodial sentences, has steadily increased since the AMC was opened. On 28 November 2017, ACTCS relocated female detainees from the Women's Cottage, to the SCC. Extensive consultation was undertaken with detainees, their families, the ACT Human Rights Commissioner, the ACT Health Services Commissioner, the Community and Public Sector Union and other key stakeholders prior to the move to ensure that the move was a success. 9 Includes a prison sentence or a community corrections order 10 Offender recidivism refers to persons whose earlier offence resulted in them being sentenced to a community-based order. 11 Includes a prison sentence or a community corrections order Justice and Community Safety Directorate 79 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The relocation has significantly increased the ability for female detainees to access programs and services and has seen a full structured day created ensuring that there are enhanced opportunities for work, education, recreation and programs, as well as enhancing access to critical services such as health. ACTCS has introduced a number of new programs for women, including the Pathways from Prison, Circle of Security, PEACE Education, Exploring Being Your Own Boss, Community Service and Life Skills, Yurbay Workshops and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Yarning Circle. The proximity of the new accommodation to the bakery has enabled furthe r employment opportunities for the women with dedicated positions and shifts specifically for female detainees. In addition, ACTCS has partnered with Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service in the provision of health and wellbeing programs for women. ACTCS also established the Women's Care team comprising of the Women and Children Services Coordinator, the Women's Case Manager and two Program Facilitators to assist all women with preparation, implementation and monitoring of their rehabilitation plans. Feasibility Study of AMC Accommodation In responding to Recommendation 6 of the Moss Review, ACTCS commissioned a feasibility study to identify, prioritise and inform future correctional requirements in a staged, cost effective manner. The study covers t he AMC Centre Logic referred to in the Government Response to the Moss Review, in addition to providing high level conceptual architectural drawings, quantity surveyor costings of options, functional design briefs and a capital works plan and procurement strategy. The feasibility study was completed in early 2018 and is being considered by Government. Enhanced Security at the AMC Contraband ACTCS employs a range of security measures to prevent the introduction of contraband, including physical barriers, closed circuit television surveillance, intelligence led interventions, searches of people and their belongings entering the AMC and patrols by Corrections Officers and the K9 unit. ACTCS also works closely with ACT Policing in support of preventing the introduction of drugs and other contraband into the AMC. Corrections Officers executed a number of both planned and random searches at the AMC during 2017 -18. The number of area searches conducted was 2,572, resulting in 5,418 searches of individual locations. Of the 5,418 individual location searches, 4,807 resulted in no contraband being located. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 80 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 12 Seized items and primary sub categories of contraband items during 2017- 2018 Figure 13 Searches and contraband items seized during 2017 -2018 New Member of the K9 Unit - AMC Uno is a four year old Labrador, Passive Alert Detection (PAD) dog, who has been operating at the AMC since mid -2017. Uno was originally sourced from the AFP after his search speed was deemed too 'slow' compared to other dogs on the course for explosive detection work, he was however assessed as perfect for the thorough and systematic search quality required for narcotic detection in a prison environment. Uno, along with his handler, attended a 14 week PAD narcotic detection course with the Victorian Corrections Safety and Emergency Services Group from Barwon, Geelong, where he not only learned to detect a variety of specific narcotic substances in a variety of different search types and locations, but graduated at the top of a class of ten other PAD dogs. Uno currently performs many different search functions at the AMC including searches of people (including detainees, visitors and staff), vehicles, property, areas and cells. He has been involved in several successful target search operations and plays a key role in attempting to ensure the safety and security of the AMC. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 81 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 14 K9 Unit Labrador Uno with his handler Detainee Health and Wellbeing New Model of Care for Detainees, Health Building Expans ion and Refurbishment In 2016, the Moss Review made a recommendation that Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Service be integrated into the provision of health care at the AMC, in order to introduc e its holistic model of care to Indigenous detainees. Winnunga's model of care proposes to integrate social and emotional wellbeing with clinical service provisions by a community controlled Aboriginal health service. The ACT Government announced funding i n the 2017 -18 Budget to commence implementation of the recommendations coming out of the Moss Review. This included funding to introduce the a new model of care at the AMC and increased capacity of health service delivery space within the Hume Health Centre, associated office accommodation and staff amenities areas. This project will create temporary office accommodation for both Winnunga and ACT Health staff and reconfigure the current Hume Health Centre to increase service delivery space for detainees. The Health Building expansion and refurbishment project is expected to be completed in 2019. A working group was established during the reporting period comprising of ACT Health, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service and ACTCS focused on developing the new model of care for detainees at the AMC. In addition, as part of the women's move ACTCS partnered with Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services to deliver health and wellbeing programs to female detainees. Collaboration with ACT Health During the reporting period, ACTCS and ACT Health worked collaboratively to deliver the agreed recommendations following the Moss Review and enhance the services delivered to detainees at the AMC. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 82 Annual Report 2017 -2018 In August 2017, the Directors-General of JACS and ACT Health signed an arrangement for the delivery of health services for detainees (the arrangement). The arrangement recognises that there are certain shared responsibilities in the management of correctional centres and a shared commitment to ensuring, as f ar as practicable, that: detainee access to suitable health services and health facilities, and a standard of health care equivalent to that available to other people in the ACT, and conditions in detention promote the health and wellbeing of detainees, and detainees are not exposed to risks of infection. In October 2017, an Information Sharing Schedule to the Arrangement was also signed. ACTCS has worked in strong collaboration with ACT Health to transfer suicide and self-harm risk assessment to ACT Health as well strengthening information sharing, policies and procedures, cross-agency collaboration and staff supports. AMC Drug and Blood Borne Virus Strategy The AMC Drug and BBV Strategy (strategy) is being developed to address health harms associated with alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and the transmission of blood borne viruses at the AMC. The strategy will specifically focus on harm minimisation in a correctional setting, including activities to support demand reduction, supply reduction and harm reduct ion. This strategy is being developed and implemented by the JACS and ACT Health directorates to support a collaborative jurisdictional approach. It will align with the National Drug Strategy 2017 - 2026 and ACT drug policy frameworks, including the forthcoming ACT Drug Strategy Action Plan. Prison Industries In 2017 -18, Industries and Facilities staff have worked towards consolidating existing service and industry detainee employment in addition to implementing new initiatives. This has resulted in the Detainee Employment Program continuing to meet the demand. The Detainee Employment Program also works closely with the Education Program to ensure that detainees undertake the mandatory education and training pre-requisites prior to commencing employment. This includes bodily spills, BBV awareness and white card (workplace, health and safety) training. There may also be other education and training requirements depending on the nature of the employment. The table below demonstrates the positive growth to service industries within the facility over the last four year period (under Report on Government Services definitions). Figure 15 Employment rate Justice and Community Safety Directorate 83 Annual Report 2017 -2018 New Initiatives Bakery The Head Baker appointment was finalised in August 2017. The AMC B akery has initially focused on employing female detainees with up to eight full time detainee employment positions available. With the appointment of a second Bakery Supervisor in May 2018, the emphasis is now on expanding infrastructure, equipment and ope rations to two shifts to undertake bakery production in- house (production of bread products alone will exceed 125,000 rolls and 42,000 bread loaves annually). This will assist in making the AMC more sustainable and reduce operating cost in the longer term. It is anticipated that the second shift of eight detainees will be drawn from a cohort of male detainees with complex needs. This category of detainee is historically problematic to place in employment due to the nature of their offences in addition to their security classification. This will provide them with the opportunity to engage in additional meaningful employment opportunities. Figure 16 AMC Bakery Head Chef Darrell Morton with female detainees Recycling The Recycling Emp loyment Program commenced in July 2017. It employs eight detainees who undertake a range of socially responsible roles separating waste streams within the AMC. The facility separates waste into 23 waste streams. The Recycling Employment Program was established to: be compliant with the AMC's biodiversity goals 'All waste awaiting removal from the facility should be secure from access by native wildlife, and by feral animals such as cats and foxes ' be suitable for correctional centre security have adequate capacity (to cater for current and future detainee and staffing numbers) to maximise purposeful activity for detainees within the facility include vocational training and employment pathways Justice and Community Safety Directorate 84 Annual Report 2017 -2018 to cater for detainees with low language, literacy and numeracy sk ills to support the ACT Government's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and waste management strategy to minimise business unit expenditure to support a repurposing principle where waste materials re -enter the economy by being reused or recycled rather than being disposed of in landfill. In its first year, the recycling area has diverted an impressive 81,943kg of waste from landfill. During the financial year, the Recycling Employment Program was nominated for the Business Sustainability Awards managed by Actsmart and the ACT Head of Service Awards as part of the innovation category. Figure 17 AMC Recycling Facility Male detainees sorting recycling Metal Fabrication ACTCS is currently developing a workshop for detainees to undertake previously outsourced sheet metal and welding repairs, upgrades and fabrication work in-house. The workshop is located in the AMC Industries building and will operate under the supervision and guidance of AMC Industries and Maintenance staff. The workshop will double as a service industry, offering employment to suitably skilled detainees and an environment for detainees wishing to upskill or enter an engineering or construction trade post release. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 85 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 18 AMC workshop Prison to Work In his February 2016 Closing the Gap address, the then Prime Minister announced that the disproportionally high incarceration rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be considered in work led by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Employment. In December 2016, Council of Australian Governements (COAG) agreed to create positive pathways to employment from prison for all adult Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander offenders and to continue consultations with Indigenous communities and organisations in the development of action plans, to drive positive, sustainable change. The Commonwealth Prison to Work report (the Report) was later released by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPM&C) and the ACT Government is responding to its findings through its own 'Prison to Work' action plan. ACTCS has been liaising with DPM&C on suitable pilot programs in the ACT that may be funded as part of the Prison to Work project. Current discussions with DPM& C have been in relation to a proposal from the 'Worldview Foundation' who have put forward their own 'Wellbeing & Employment Readiness' program which contains a focus on disadvantaged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the ACT. The Worldview program offers a holistic wellbeing, mentoring and employment program that intends to offer training to selected detainees pre-release in preparation for employment and further training on release, initially within their ICT Asset Disposal Service. This program is intended to link with ACTCS Extended Throughcare Program. The Worldview proposal also has scope for expansion enabling employment within their native food and glass recycling projects, supported with transitional housing options for participants. The ACT welcomes the Commonwealth's engagement on the issue of employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees upon release as flagged in the Report. Employment is a key protective factor in addressing offending behaviour and provides an opportunity to make a Justice and Community Safety Directorate 86 Annual Report 2017 -2018 fundamental difference to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander offenders and their families. The ACT will work with the Commonwealth Government on initiatives that can provide better employment outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. ACTCS has been advised that the Commonwealth Government has funded Worldview's proposal and will continue working with Worldview on implementing the pilot. Detainee Education a nd Training ACT continues to deliver high levels of detainee education and training. Education enrolment levels have been maintained through 2015 -16, and 2016 -17 at levels previously reported, almost double the national average at approximately 70%. This level of engagement has been maintained despite an increasing detainee population, the complexity of maintaining security classification separation in the AMC and an increased turnover in detainees being admitted and released. The AMC continues to offer more than 20 Vocational Education and Training (VET) skills sets and general education units. These include units in the Foundation Skills Training Package that embed literacy and numeracy in VET courses as well as direct delivery of the Foundation Skills Tra ining Package competencies. Completion of a Foundation Skills (Australian Core Skills Framework) assessment is required before a detainee can enrol in a VET course. Once assessed, detainees are enrolled in one of three appropriate Foundation Skills Certificates as well as the VET skill sets. AMC Education and Training is in the process of expanding its choice of Vocational Training electives by partnering with other registered training organisations that have additional scope. As in previous years, the priority in delivering embedded literacy and numeracy skills within the Foundation Skills Training Package, continued either as core or elective VET units, is difficult to breakdown as individual training plans differ dependent upon the elective VET skillset s tream selected. The number of competencies for 2017-18 was similar to previous years. Table 16 Total number of competencies Total number of competencies VET Certificates Statements of Attainment 742 174 592 In regard to university distance education, the number of detainees enrolled and participating fluctuated widely in 2017 -18. Table 17 Detainees enrolled at university Number of detainees enrolled Semester 1 Number of detainees completing Semester 1 26 5 At the commencement of Semester 1 of 2018, 26 detainees were enrolled in forms of higher education ranging from the Tertiary Preparation Programs to PhD studies. This included four women and five indigenous detainees. Detainees exiting from the AMC, withdrawing their enrolment and not completing the requirements of the unit impacted on the number of detainees that completed Semester 1. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 87 Annual Report 2017 -2018 BBV Awareness education continued to be delivered as a mandatory requirement during education induction and is mandatory f or obtaining detainee employment. Recreational and cultural art and music courses continued to be facilitated and supported on a number of cultural days including NAIDOC week and Waitangi Day (New Zealand Day). Further information on both cultural days can be found later in this report. Family Connection Regular contact with family and friends is critical to the rehabilitation of detainees and can assist with strengthening family relationships and successful reintegration into the community u pon exiting the AMC. Each year ACTCS facilitates thousands of visits to detainees in the AMC. The visits schedule provides for two one hour visits per week for each detainee, allocated by accommodation area and aims to give every detainee fair and equitable access to visits.

ACTCS has engaged Shine for Kids, a non-Government organisation, for the provision of family services at the AMC. The services provides consist of the: Prison Invisits Program - the program provides a variety or arts, craft and diversionary activities for children when visiting their parent at the AMC Story Time Program - the program enables parents in custody to strengthen their bond with their children, take a role in their child's education while possibly improving their own literacy levels. The detained parent reads a children's story and it is recorded onto a CD or Hallmark recordable book. The books or CDs are forwarded onto the child so that they can read the book while listening to their parent's voice reading the story Child/Parent Activity Days - activities days are run during the ACT school holiday period at the AMC and attempt to provide an environment in which a child and parent can interact through activities that can be done together for example, creating art and playing games Children's Supported Transport Services - this service aims to transport children safely to the AMC to assist children re -establish and/or maintain positive relationships with their parent(s)/carer(s) while they are in custody. ACTCS has partnered with West Belconnen Family Centre to deliver Circle of Security Parenting Programs at the AMC. Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander - cultural activities With approximately 21.7% of the detainee population identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander in 2017-18, ACTCS recognises that culturally appropriate activities and events are critical elements to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees to succeed in rehabilitation. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 88 Annual Report 2017 -2018 In making key decisions around detainee welfare, specific consideration is given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and kinship; one example of this would be in considering relationship when considering a detainee's attendance at funerals or other significant events. More information is included within B.1. Organisational Overview. NAIDOC Family Day ACTCS holds a Family Day event annually as part of the NAIDOC Week celebrations. More information is included within B.1 Organisational Overview. New Zealand Day For the first time in 2017 -18, ACTCS held a family day event on Waitangi Day, the national day of New Zealand. The day provided the opportunity for detainees in the AMC and their families to come together to mark New Zealand Day and provided an opportunity to acknowledge and commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and the history of the day itself. Families were invited to watch two performances - the Waiata-ringa and Waitangi Haka and share a lunch of traditional Maori food. Twelve male detainees performed although not all identified as Polynesian. There were approximately 48 visitors on the day. Art Programs and Initiatives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander detainees have the opportunity to engage in art production in a number of ways. More infor mation is available in B.1 Organisational Overview. Court Transport Unit The Court Transport Unit (CTU) is located within the ACT court precinct in Canberra City. CTU is responsible for maintaining the secure custody of adults and juveniles who may have been either remanded or sentenced to and from their secure locations to attend court appearances. CTU staff also provide inductions and perform transport risk assessments. Sentence Administration The Sentence Administration team ensures that offenders are held in custody in accordance with court orders/warrants by maintaining up -to-date sentence calculations for offenders serving custodial sentences. The area also facilitates the transfer of prison sentences, parole orders and community -based sentences. Transfers of Community Based Sentences The transfer of community based sentences between jurisdictions remains the subject of cross-jurisdictional discussions and development of model legislation. A draft framework exists between NSW and the ACT pending the completion of ongoing work across all jurisdictions to resolve a national approach to the transfer of community based sentenced. However, variation in community- based sentences (including combination sentencing) across jurisdictions has slowed the development of this framework. A cross-jurisdictional working group on legislation continues to progress this framework.

Applications are made only when an offender is seeking to permanently transfer from one jurisdiction to another. Approval for an interstate transfer may be given by a receiving jurisdiction, prior to the granting of parole, in order that the sending jurisd iction's parole authority may be fully informed of an offender's post -release plans before making a release decision. Once registered in the receiving state or territory, the parole order becomes an order of that jurisdiction and is subject to the receivin g state or territory's laws. Table 21 ACT parole orders transferred interstate (includes matters pending in one financial year that were finalised in the next financial year) 2013 -14 2014 -15 2015 -16 2016 -17 2017 -18 NSW 4 5 9 6 6 Other jurisdictions 0 3 0 3 2 Total 4 8 9 9 8 Justice and Community Safety Directorate 90 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Table 22 Interstate parole orders transferred into the ACT (includes matters pending in one financial year that were finalised in the next financial year) 2013 -14 2014 -15 2015 -16 2016-17 2017 -18 NSW 14 7 22 12 19 Other jurisdictions 1 1 1 2 2 Total 15 8 23 14 21 Transfer of prison sentences The Crimes (Sentence Administration) Act 2005 provides a framework for detainees to apply and serve their sentences in correctional centres in states or territories, other than that in which they were convicted. The two areas for consideration of an application for transfer are 'welfare' reasons or 'trial' reasons. A transfer for trial purposes may be considered where the detainee needs to deal with matters in another state or territory according to law. Requests for transfer for either welfare or trial reasons are subject to agreement by relevant Ministers in respective states and territories and must be considered within the parameters of the relevant legislation. In 2017 -18, one request to a transfer prison sentence into the ACT on welfare grounds was finalised, and one application to transfer out of the ACT was received. Victims Register ACTCS maintains the ACT Victims Register (the Register) in accordance with the Crimes (Sentence Administration) Act 2005 (the Act). The Register records the names and contact details of victims who have asked to be registered in order to receive information about an offender who is subject to a custodial or co mmunity -based sentence. The ACTCS Victim Liaison Officer (VLO) maintains the Register and engages with victims who wish to become registered. The VLO provides registered victims with the necessary information and support to make submission/s to the Sentenc e Administration Board regarding the impact that an offender's parole is likely to have on them. The VLO is able to provide basic support to victims of crime and provides referrals to external agencies when required. T his includes referrals to Victims Support ACT and other community support services. Provisions in the Act allow for the disclosure of offender information to a registered victim. At the end of the 2017-18 financial year there were 140 victims registered on the ACT Victims Register. Of these, 48 requested placement on the register during the reporting period. This compares with 34 in 2016- 17, 36 in 2015 -16 and 10 in 2014 -15. Community Corrections and Release Planning Community Corrections and Release Plannin g is responsible for supervising offenders on court orders and for the monitoring of compliance with court-imposed conditions. Supervision is focused on reducing the offender's assessed criminogenic risk. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 91 Annual Report 2017 -2018 This function primarily operates from 249 London Ci rcuit, Canberra City. ACTCS also partners with Winnunga Nimmityjah Health and Community Services to provide a community based reporting hub for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander offenders on Community Based Orders. This is located at Winnunga's premise s in Narrabundah.

ICOs are available as an alternative to full time imprisonment for eligible offenders serving short sentences (generally up to two years, or in exceptional circumstances up to four years). With the consent of the offender, ICOs allow suitable offenders to serve their sentence of imprisonment in the community under the supervision of ACTCS. An ICO features supervision which is very intensive and significantly greater than what offenders on other types of community orders are subject to. This includes more frequent appointments, more frequent drug testing, field visits to the home and workplace and curfew provisions. The ICO is also designed to provide greater incentive for an offender to address their offending behaviour through attendance at rehabilitation programs. Prior to the court making an ICO, an offender is subject to an assessment conducted by Community Corrections. On 30 June 2018, there were 69 offenders serving an ICO. Community Corrections and Release Planning completed 248 ICO Assessment Reports at the request of ACT Courts and Tribunal. There is a suite of sanctions for offenders who fail to meet the conditions including the issuing of a warning, imposing a short-term period of imprisonment of either three or seven days and cancellation of the order and imprisonment for the balance of the sentence. These sanctions are administered by the Sentence Administration Board. 12 ACTCS has changed the calculation method to comply with national counting methods for persons serving community correction orders in 2014- 15. This is reflected in the reduction of total average number of offenders supervised by Community Corrections. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 92 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Community Service Orders The Community Service Work Unit sits within Community Corrections and Release Planning and administers Good Behaviour Orders that have a community service work condition - a reparative and rehabilitative sentencing option. Offenders who are subject to such orders may be required to perform up to 500 hours of community service. Offenders participate on work crews which cur rently operate four days per week and undertake projects at various outdoor locations which counts toward their community service hours. Additionally, offenders are sometimes placed directly at agencies (with not-for- profit organisations), or are engaged in the Myna Bird Cage Project, operated by ACTCS. Table 24 Community Service Work Order 2014 -15 2015 -16 2016 -17 2017 -18 Total number of Offenders with Community Service Work Orders 381 359 372 369 Total Hours Ordered 26,469 22,521 22,141 27,333 The estimated relative value to the community of work performed during 2017- 18 was approximately $696,644. This is an increase of 23.4%, or approximately $132,330, from 2016- 17, which was $564,314. This is due the increase in the number of hours worked during the financial year. Rehabilitation of Offenders Custodial and Community Correctional Programs ACTCS has continued to provide high quality criminogenic, psycho-educational programs, and wellbeing programs in the AMC and the community, for both male and female offenders. These programs include: Adult Sex Offender Program Adult Sex Offender Maintenance Program Cognitive Self Change Domestic Abuse Program First Steps Alcohol and Drug Course First Steps to Anger Management Program Seasons for Growth Sex Offenders with Learning and/or Intellectual Disabilities Program Sober Driver Program Violence Intervention Program. ACTCS has also worked jointly with external providers in delivering: Solaris Therapeutic Community Program Harm Minimisation Justice and Community Safety Directorate 93 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program Coordination of Alcoholics Anonymous Meetings Alcohol and Drug Services Individual AOD counselling Circle of Security Program Parents as Teachers Program Self-Management and Recovery Training Program Pathways from Prison Coming Home Program Culture and Land Management Program Indigenous Traditional Cultural Healing Yarning Arts Program Winnunga Social Well-Being Program Winnunga No More Boondah Program Elde rs and Community Leaders Visitation Program Peace Education Program Legal Literacy Workshops Being a Man and a Dad Shine for Kids. Domestic Abuse Program The Domestic Abuse Program (DAP) is a 20 session rehabilitative group intervention program run by ACTCS for domestic violence perpetrators subject to community-based or custodial sentences who are assessed as being of medium risk of reoffending or higher. The DAP was first offered in 2015. The DAP draws on a gendered understanding of violence and abuse within relationships and addresses these issues from the perspective of power and control. The DAP explores links between behaviours, thoughts and feelings in relation to offending with a clear focus on accountability and assisting them to gaining insight and skills to engage in nonviolent , non-abusive and respectful relationships. Supporting and enabling the conduct of this program is the individual case management of this group of offenders, both before and after the group program. Three DAPs were conducted in the community, and three were delivered in the AMC during the 2017 -18 financial year. ACTCS has sought to ensure management of domestic violence offenders is consistent with emerging national standards for perpetrator programs. Consistent with these standards we seek to promote the safety and protection of victims and children by offering support provided by the Domestic Violence Crisis Service and other community agencies. The management of the DAP is overseen by a Reference Group that is linked with the Family Violence Intervention Program Coordinating Committee. The purpose of this oversight is to ensure collaboration in the management of higher risk domestic and family violence offenders. Corrections Psychological and Support Services Corrections Psychological and Support Services (CPSS) provides support and therapeutic interventions to detainees at the AMC. This includes psychological assessment and intervention for detainees with mild - moderate mental illness, care coordination for detainees with complex needs, Justice and Community Safety Directorate 94 Annual Report 2017 -2018 facilitation of the Peer Mentor Program, facilitation of criminogenic and wellbeing programs, and advice on operational matters inclu ding segregation reviews and behaviour support planning. The responsibility for detainee suicide and self-harm assessment and treatment was transitioned from CPSS to ACT Health Forensic Mental Health Services (FMHS) on 16 April 2018. The future role of CPSS is ongoing to ensure that their resources are used to maximum effect across the AMC. CPSS is comprised of one team leader, who holds qualifications in psychology (clinical). The team leader oversees two full -time ongoing social workers, one full- time con tracted social worker, one full-time ongoing occupational therapist, one full -time contracted occupational therapist, and one part-time ongoing psychologist (forensic). Throughout 2017 -18, in line with the arrangement between the Directors-General of Justi ce and Community Safety and ACT Health for the Delivery of Health Services for Detainees, CPSS continued to build positive and proactive relationships with ACT Health particularly FMHS. Extended Throughcare The Extended Throughcare Program continued to provide support to those leaving the AMC and had substantial program developments during the year. Table 25 Total releases to Throughcare Total release to Throughcare 2014 -15 2015 -16 2016 -17 2017 -18 Male 209 270 344 331 Female 44 75 76 123 Total 253 345 420 454 ACTCS implemented a criteria change for the Extended Throughcare in April 2018 to an eligibility model based on an individual's length of time in custody in response to the findings of the 2017 evaluation of Extended Throughcare conducted by researchers at the Social Policy Research Centre (University of New South Wales) and also stakeholder feedback. This was in recognition that the longer someone has been out of the community, the harder it is to reintegrate into the community, and the more support is likely to be needed. The previous criteria required men to be under sentence, whereas the new criteria is open both to those held on remand and under sentence. Women, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men are promoted under the new eligibility criteria. This is with the aim of addressing the particular challenges facing both of these cohorts upon release, and as part of addressing the over- representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people within the criminal justice system. As part of the Extended Throughcare Program, a procurement process for a new outreach provider was completed in the reporting year, with CatholicCare Canberra and Goulburn selected to deliver services for participants. This service provides an intensive support outreach package to clients referred by ACTCS, and is designed to provide short term support to some Throughcare clients post custody. The outreach program has a two tiered service design, with clients able to access two or four weeks outreach support, according to their level of need. The service can be accessed by those on a planned release from custody or to Throughcare clients referred from the community imme diately post release. Throughcare clients not referred to this service may work with a number of other partner organisations, or receive support directly from ACTCS staff. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 95 Annual Report 2017 -2018 In addition, the program is now working with the directorate's Yarrabi Bamirr Program. Yarrabi Bamirr aims to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program participants and their families, in partnership with other government agencies and community organisations. This initiative is a trial working with a small number of clients. The Extended Throughcare Program was shortlisted as a finalist in the Institute of Public Administration Australia Public Sector Innovation awards, in the category of Citizen-Centred Innovation. ACTCS representatives attended a pitch event in June 2018. Enhancing Capability Correctional Officer Recruitment As at 30 June 2018, there were 233 correctional officers (including casual correctional officers). In 2017, ACTCS conducted a bulk recruitment process for correctional officers and attracted over 300 applicants. Of these 17 new recruits (12 male and five females) were selected to complete the ten- week training course and all graduated in November 2017. Community Corrections Officer Recruitment In June 2017, ACTCS engaged in one recruitment process for Community Correction Officers, formerly titled Probation and Parole officers. This process attracted nearly 56 applicants and was finalised in October 2017. As at 30 June 2018, there were 36 Community Correction Officers, with recruitment continuing in the 2018- 19 financial year. Attracting and retaining women in Corrections ACTCS continued to attract women to the workforce during 2017-18. Strategies used as part of the marketing campaign during the correctional officer recruitment drive, emphasised opportunities for women to join the Agency. Nine females applied for positions of corrective officers in the custodial officer recruitment drive in 2017. Of these, five were appointed including two Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. In addition, leadership training and opportunities to act in higher positions have been provided to women within the Agency to enhance career development. Employing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people ACTCS continued to attract Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander candidates to correctional positions, as a result of a successful recruitment round the previous year. As at 30 June 2018, there were 26 employees who identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and the Agency has nine identified positions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This is approximately 6.21 percent of ACTCS' overall workforce. Increasing Public Awareness ACTCS held two separate public information sessions during the year to create a wider pool of potential applicants and facilitate a greater understanding of custodial roles. These were advertised across various types of media, including electronic media. These campaigns were designed to raise public awareness of the responsibilities of ACTCS, how custodial roles are carried out, and to diminish negative stereotyping which sometimes accompanies corrective services activities. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 96 Annual Report 2017 -2018 During the public information sessions, potential applicants were encouraged to ask questions of current custodial staff and other subject experts on specific topics about working in corrections. ACTCS has been conducting public information sessions over the past three year as a strategy to improve public awareness and build diversity in our workforce by encouraging greater involvement from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from culturally and linguistically diverse background and women. This strategy seems to be working as evidenced by the increased number of applications from women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in particular. Training and Development Custodial Mandatory Training Training for correctional officers is delivered according to a schedule of training modules identified through a needs analysis and prioritised according to the Correctional Officers Enterprise Agreement, legislative, government, operational and policy requirements and agreed to by the ACTCS Executive. Custodial Mandatory Training (CMT) is scheduled to occur one half- day weekly throughout the year and all available officers attend each mandatory session. In 2017 -18, correctional officers undertook over 650 CMT modules. These modules included Fire Awareness; Policies and Procedures; Suicide and Self Harm Awareness; Use of Force; Master Control Room (MC R) which includes 16 competencies including control of cameras and monitors; Radicalisation and Extremism Awareness Program (REAP); and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Refresher training. Other full day training included Breathing Apparatus training delivered by ACT ESA for 28 corrections officers; and the full First Aid qualification for 130 corrections officers. Three new training programs were introduced this financial year: REAP, Master Control Room (MCR), and Use of Force & Situational Awareness Refresher. REAP: The Training and Development Unit (TDU) has utilised materials provided by the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department and assimilated them into the ACT context. The Attorney General's Department is seeking to have REAP rolled out across all Corrective Services jurisdictions across Australia. The first REAP session in the ACT was delivered during CMT in June 2018. MCR: As a result of the Moss Review ACTCS increased competence was identified, the TDU developed MCR training which has been delivered in two blocks: Theory, block one is delivered in a classroom setting and is a three hour theoretical component which aims to revise and update knowledge of procedures and protocols, including changes within the MCR. In November 2017, a compliance module of this training was developed and delivered to supervisors and CO2s. Practical, block two is on -the- job training. The TDU has been coordinating, delivering and supporting supervisors to deliver this training for officers based on an assessment of t heir training priority and identified training needs. Use of Force and Situational Awareness: This module trains custodial officers in the safe use of equipment and techniques. It focuses on Use of Force legislation, principles and situational response to force. The practical scenario component emphasises the decision- making processes around when, how and what type of de-escalation is appropriate. The module includes the required 'annual assessment of competency' for the technical application of equipment s uch as handcuffs. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 97 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Work Placements: Traineeships, Graduates, Work Experience, Interns ACTCS has supported employees with a range of workplace opportunities. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Traineeship Program ACTCS hosted a trainee as part of this agency initiative. The trainee was placed in three business units and provided with the opportunity to complete a Certificate III in Business Administration. The trainee, who excelled in her studies, was one of five finalists shortlisted for the NAIDOC Awards, and was also one of six finalists shortlisted for the category of ACT Australian (Apprentice) Trainee of the Year Awards 2017. ACTPS Graduate program Two graduates completed a number of rotations in ACTCS and in other Directorates; one was based in Community Corrections on completion of the program and the other is still undertaking the program. Work Experience and Support Program One participant of this ACT Government program was placed in the Business Systems team. The program offers four weeks of formal office skills training and eight weeks of practical work experience in an ACTPS workplace which is designed to help Canberrans from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to enter the workforce. Placements ACTCS accommodated five intern psychologist placements at 100 hours each based at Community Corrections (4) and Programs (1). In addition, two counselling students were based at the AMC for a placement period of 140 hours each. Training and Development Activities The TDU continued to coordinate and deliver a broad range of professional development activities for all ACTCS employees. These include mandatory training prescribed by the directorate, ACTPS training and other operational and/or job specific training. Nine week Custodi al Recruit Training (CRT) Program for 17 newly recruited Correctional Officers incorporating mandatory, operational and knowledge-based modules. Delivery of over 25 Security Awareness sessions for more than 250 contractors, employees and professional visit ors to the AMC. Two ACTCS employees successfully completed the Public Sector Management Program (PSMP) and were awarded a Graduate Certificate in Business (Public Sector Management) from the Queensland University of Technology. The PSMP is an intensive and demanding program delivered over a 15 month period and focuses on developing management skills in the business of government. Conferences Custodial and Community Corrections and Release Planning staff were supported to attend a range of conferences addressing operationally relevant topics and to support staff development and ACTCS strategic priorities including: Mental Health Symposium Australian Correctional Leadership Program Justice and Community Safety Directorate 98 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Menslink Breakfast Indigenous Justice Workshop Strangulation and Intervention Program Restorative Practice Forum with International Experts Sentencing Conference PACCOA (Probation & Community Corrections Officers Association) Conference , and Women in Leadership Summit. Information Management and ICT Improvements Corrective Services Information Management Solution (CSIMS) Project In July 2016, the Territory entered into a contract with Canadian-based company, Abilis Solutions, to provide and manage a new offender-management system, known as CORIS\u00ae for ACTCS. Abilis is contracted to imp lement the system by mid-2019 and to provide ongoing hosting and support. ACTCS and the Abilis team have been systematically working to configure CORIS\u00ae in accordance with the requirements of the Offender Lifecycle Model. By early August 2018, Abilis will deliver the sandbox version of CORIS \u00ae to ACTCS for testing and feedback. The CSIMS project team will undertake vigorous testing to ensure that CORIS\u00ae automates and supports ACTCS' operational procedures adequately. Upgrade of ACTCS Radios In 2017 -18, ACTCS commenced the program of work to replace the existing analogue radio communication infrastructure in use at the AMC with a new digital radio communication system using the Territory Radio Network (TRN). The TRN provides a w hole of government radio communication system that is used by a number of other ACT Government agencies. This system will provide greater security and interoperability between various agencies. As a part of this project, ACTCS has completed the upgrade of radio systems used by the CTU vehicles for detainee escorts to and from various locations such as the AMC, the courts, hospitals, and interstate transfers. This has enabled better radio communication capability and coverage for correctional officers undertaking these escort duties. ACTCS has also completed TRN infrastructure implementation and testing at the AMC which will support the portable radios used within AMC. Using the whole of government contract set up with Harris Communication (Australia) Pty Ltd, ACTCS has procured the portable radios and related accessories as well as support and maintenance services. Work is continuing with Harris to define and implement the detailed radio profile requirement to meet operational communication requirements for the AMC as well as the CTU. The project is well on track to deliver the fully featured TRN based radio system for whole of ACTCS by the end of 2018. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 99 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Reviews and External Scrutiny Response to Moss Review Following the death in custody of Mr Steven Freeman, the Minister for Corrections announced on 2 June 2016 a review into his care and supervision at the AMC. Mr Philip Moss AM led this review and publicly released the Moss Review on 10 November 2016. The Government responded to the Moss Review on 16 February 2017 agreeing, or agreeing in principle, to eight of the nine recommendations. The Government noted a ninth recommendation relating to the Health Services Commissioner. Since the Government released its response to the Moss Review, the ACT Government has taken significant steps to improve the well-being and safety of people in the AMC. Implementation of the recommendations was led by an Inter-Directorate Project team reporting to a high -level oversight Steering Committee. The Steering Committee is independently chaired by Mr Russell Taylor AM, who was appointed by the Minister for Corrections to lead this work and to report directly to him on the implementation of the recommendations. The Steering Committee comprises the Directors-General of JACS, ACT Health and the Community Services Directorate together with representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, including a representative from the ATSIEB, CEO of Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services and a representative from the Aboriginal Legal Service. The Steering Committee is playing a crucial role in giving reassurance that the Inter-Directorate Project Team is meeting community expectations about the desired outcomes for each of the recommendations. The Minister for Corrections provided an update against all the recommendations through a Ministerial Statement to the Legislative Assembly in February 2018. Significant progress has been made against all the recommendations. The Chair of the Steering Committee is anticipated to provide a final report to the Minister in the first quarter of 2018- 19. Inspector of Correctional Services Effective and independent oversight is important to build and maintain public confidence in the ACT's corrections system . Establishing an Inspector of Correctional Services was a commitment of government, in response to Recommendation 8 of the Moss Review. In June 2018, the Inspector began a review of the management and care of remand- only detainees under Section 17(1)(b) of the Inspector of Correctional Services Act 2017. ACTCS looks forward to working closely with the Inspector of Correctional Services in accordance with the Act. Official Visitors Official Visitors are appointed to undertake independent inspections of adult correctional facilities in the ACT and take complaints from detainees under the Official Visitor Act 2012 . On 17 December 2017, the Minister for Justice, Consumer Affairs and Road Safety appointed Mr Shannon Pickles and Ms Denise Brasser as Corrections Official Visitors for a three year term. Ms Tracey Whetnall continued as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Official Visitor. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 100 Annual Report 2017 -2018 During the year, the Official Visitors regularly attended the AMC, as well as the CTU cells at the ACT Courts precinct. They met with detainees to hear their concerns and liaised with ACTCS staff to discuss any issues. As a result, the Official Visitors have made 20 recommendations around the operations of the AMC. ACTCS has addressed 14 of the 20 recommendation. The remaining six were made in the Official Visitors' April - June 2018 Quarterly Report and will be addressed early in 2018 - 19. Official Visitors are obliged to provide regular written reports directly to the Minister for Corrections, detailing the number and types of complaints including remedial action. The Mental Health Official Visitor, Ms Sue Connor, is also able to visit detainees in receipt of mental health treatment and care in a correctional centre. Indigen ous Official Visitor Annual Report - Tracy Whetnall I have been the Indigenous Official Visitor since 2011 and continue to enjoy the role and the opportunity to visit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women in Canberra's prison. During financial year 2017-18 I visited detainees at the AMC on 91 occasions. Complaints raised by detainees have been about lack of opportunities to go to rehab and accommodation on release. The lack of Indigenous Case Managers and new Case Managers is frustrating detainees not knowing who they need to speak to. Throughcare seems to be improving if key staff interact with detainees at least six weeks before release, when this is done detainees leave feeling more reassured. Other complaints by detainees range from not being aware of or told about programs available to them, and that those programs may assist in their parole applications, or reintegration into the community. The detainees enjoy when the Indigenous elders do their regular visits but at one time only certain detainees got to meet and speak with them. Lately however the staff having been walking around the AMC with the elders which is slowly removing this concern, as the detainees look forward to these visits. Yarning groups for both male and female detainees have commenced and these seem to be good and the detainees are enjoying these. Even though numbers of Indigenous detainees has risen many detainees advise me that they are Indigenous and not down on the list and therefore not recognised, so this in turn confuses our statistics. Maybe an audit needs to be done, with key agencies, to finally identify the correct numbers of Indigenous detainees. Some Indigenous organisations visit the AMC regularly, but detainees will complain not seeing them or having the oppo rtunity to speak to them. The AMC is getting better each year with approving and arranging escorts to funerals and to see family members in hospital. Most issues that I have raised over the year are being dealt with by Corrections staff to the best of their abilities. Since the departure of Mr Rushton it's still confusing who to speak to when needing issues dealt with. Official Visitors Annual Report - Shannon Pickles and Denise Brasser The last year has seen significant change in both the Official Visitor program and the nature of the AMC. At short notice, the prior Corrections Official Visitor ended her term due to taking up a position Justice and Community Safety Directorate 101 Annual Report 2017 -2018 with the Sentence Administration Board. A temporary six month replacement was found in Shannon Pickles an existing Official Visitor for Mental Health. During this interim period the responsibility for induction and training of the Official Visitor was placed on ACTCS and AMC staff which created confusion. In December 2017 the term of Shan non Pickles was made permanent for a full three year term and an additional Official Visitor Corrections was appointed in Denise Brasser for three years. During the year a large scale review of the entire Official Visitor scheme was undertaken and some of the practical feedback around difficulties in responsibility for recruitment, induction and training were provided. It is expected the recommendations of this review will come into effect over the next 12 months which may lead to significant change in the functioning and oversight of the Official Visitor scheme. These changes in the Official Visitor staffing were mirrored in having the General Manager position within the ACTCS structure change, and the long term Deputy General Manager of the AMC retire. This has however proven to be an excellent opportunity to refresh and renew relationships between AMC management and the Official Visitor's, and many positive discussions have occurred to this effect. Table 26 Official Visitor Visits Number AMC CTU Other Total Official Visits 89 6 17 112 It is noted that whilst the number of visits to the AMC did not significantly increase (70 to 89) the number of complaints rose from 236 to 368. Primary reasons for this could be considered detainees taking advantage of fresh/new faces to raise old/ongoing issues, the increasing number of detainees, and also increased usage of the email system for complaints. An average of 1- 2 email complaints per week were received over the year. The most common type of complaints related to finance (external money transfers not occurring in time for buyup), maintenance (urgent matters not being addressed in a timely fashion), health (waiting times significantly delayed), and probation and parole (reports not being accurate, inability to access housing causing denial of release). A cause of concern over the year has been another jump in detainee numbers from 450 to over 500 at the time of this report. Increasing number impacts not only concern of overcrowding, but deman d on basic infrastructure such as computers, toilets, bathrooms, and kitchens. Flow on effects to waiting times/access to health, and increased levels of lock downs due to association challenges and staffing demand. Without a specific plan of action to either reduce the level of new detainees coming in to the AMC, or concrete plans put in place to expand accommodation and support facilities numbers will inevitably continue to rise, tempers of detainees heighten, and access to basic and regular services falter. It is recognised part of this problem is a significant lack of exit options for detainees, either those on remand with nowhere appropriate to be bailed to, or those seeking to be released on parole with nowhere appropriate to be paroled to. Many detainees report they do not even bother applying for parole if they know they have nowhere they can stay. A significant change this year occurred with the transfer of all of the women to the special care unit building and a spill and fill from other blocks/cottages to back fill the gaps. This move was necessary as the number of women detainees has raised at an unexpected rate and inappropriate Justice and Community Safety Directorate 102 Annual Report 2017 -2018 accommodation was being sourced in the old management unit. This move was managed extremely well with a minimum of disru ption for the unit (in fact the OV received feedback from a number of detainees how impressed they were how smooth the day went). However there has been a large amount of ongoing complaints from the women that were moved, primarily as their living conditio ns without question are nowhere near as nice as their former quarters. It should be noted that the transparency and communication from AMC staff and management with the OV's has been excellent. Complaints raised are nearly always investigated and responded to in a prompt and reasonable way, and responsibility is always taken if issues are identified and action promptly taken. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 103 Annual Report 2017 -2018 B.2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - OUTPUT 3.1 COURTS AND TRIBUNAL Output Description The ACT Courts and Tribunal (ACTCT) is responsible for the provision of high quality support to judicial officers and tribunal members in the Supreme Court, Magistrates Court and ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT ) and high quality services to the public using the courts and tribunal. Strategic Objectives Priorities and Performance During 2017 -18 the ACTCT continued to focus on the following priorities: the new court facilities project the development of the new ICT integrated courts management system strengthening the administration of the courts and tribunal, including implementation of the International Framework for Courts Excellence and the Australasian Framework for Tribunal Excellence, and improving access to the courts and tribunal. These priorities increase the efficiency, effectiveness and timeliness of court and tribunal operations. Appointments and retirements Figure 19 Justice Hilary Penfold's Ceremonial Sitting Associate Justice Verity McWilliam , Justice Hilary Penfold and Chief Justice Helen Murrell During the reporting year the Supreme Court had the following changes: Justice Hilary Penfold retired as a Judge of the Supreme Court on 23 March 2018, and Justice Chrissa Loukas-Karlsson commenced as a Judge of the Supreme Court on 26 March 2018. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 104 Annual Report 2017 -2018 During t he reporting year, Acting Judges Walmsley, Robinson and Ashford were appointed from 1 July 2017 and ending 30 June 2018. Justice Charlesworth of the Federal Court of Australia was appointed as an Additional Judge of the Supreme Court on 14 November 2017. During the reporting year Special Magistrates Margaret Hunter and Ken Cush were reappointed until 31 December 2018. During the reporting year, the following ACAT appointments were made: Ms Theresa Warwick as an Ordinary Member for the period 21 July 2017 - 31 December 2022 Ms Moira Murray as an Ordinary Member for the period 21 July 2017 - 20 January 2018 Mr Stephen Lancken as an Ordinary Member for the period 3 January 2018 - 31 December 2022 Mr Dominic Mulligan as an Ordinary Member for the period 3 January 2018 - 31 December 2022 Ms Elizabeth Trickett as an Ordinary Member for the period 3 January 2018 - 31 December 2022 Dr Katherine Lubbe as a Senior Member for the period 13 June 2018 - 12 June 2023, and Dr Peter Norrie as a Senior Member for the period 13 June 2018 - 12 June 2023. Disposition times in the courts and ACAT The ACTCT has supported initiatives by the Supreme Court, Magistrates Court and ACAT to deal with matters in a reasonably expeditious manner having regard to the nature and complexity of each case. Information about the median times to finalise cases in each jurisdiction is set out in the section on strategic objectives in this annual report. Further information about the performance of the courts and ACAT are included in the annual review for each court and ACAT. Eastman Proceedings 2017 -18 A large number of pre-trial issues were heard and determined during the reporting year with the last matter finalised on 1 June 2018. Acting Justice Kellam made over 30 rulings, often with extensive written reasons, in relation to pre-trial applications dealing with substantial and complex legal issues. Most of the rulings are the subject of non-publication orders pending the finalisation of the trial. On 5 June 2018, a jury of 16 was empanelled from a panel of approximately 480 people. The trial commenced with the opening by the prosecution on 18 June 2018. The trial is estimated to run for six months. ICT Integrated Case Management System The ACTCT is implementing a new case management system known as the ICMS. The ICMS is a more efficient business system which will improve service delivery to the judiciary, tribunal members and court and tribunal users and will provide a platform for a number of online services, such as electronic lodgement of court and tribunal documents. The ICMS system is being rolled out in three stages. The first stage was successfully implemented in the ACAT in December 2015. Stage 2 focused on the civil jurisdiction and was successfully implemented in September 2016. The third and final stage deals with the criminal jurisdiction, online Justice and Community Safety Directorate 105 Annual Report 2017 -2018 services such as a criminal portal and electronic lodgement facility, and interfaces with key justice and other agencies. The final stage is due for release and staged uptake from late 2018. New Court Facilities In December 2015, the Territory entered into an agreement with Juris Partnership, comprising Laing O'Rourke, Macquarie Capital and their partners, to deliver a new $165 million justice precinct for the Australian Capital Territory. The ACT Courts project in the centre of Canberra is the Territory's first public -private partnership. The project will create a combined courts facility for the ACT which will support operational efficiencies while respecting the jurisdictional separation between the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court. The Supreme Court will be located within a new four-storey building to be constructed along Vernon Circle. It will also occupy parts of the existing Supreme Court building following its refurbishment during 2018 -19. Works commenced on the new building in 2016 and are progressing with stage one due for completion during the second half of 2018. This stage will deliver six new courtrooms for the Supreme Court, new library accommodation, jury facilities, remote witness suites, new registry and new public entrance. The second stage (which includes the refurbishment of the existing Supreme Court building) is due for completion in 2019. When the project is finished the ACT will have modern court facilities that expand capacity for trials and alternative dispute resolution processes, improve jury and vulnerable witness facilities, enhance the custodial areas and support the use of courtroom technologies. Frameworks for court and tribunal excellence Work continued during the year on implementation of the frameworks for courts and tribunal excellence. Each court conducted internal surveys to help identify and prioritise areas for improvement, including the use of technology in the conduct of court proceedings. A survey of each court's users is being planned for early 2019. Review of performance indicators During the year the ACTCT worked with the heads of jurisdiction to review the strategic and accountability indicators for the courts and ACAT. The ACTCT had a large number of indicators, most of which duplicated the measures set out in the annual Report on Government Services. The changes will streamline and improve the usability of the indicators. The strategic indicators measuring the median time from lodgement to finalisation of matters will be replaced with the International Framework for Courts Excellence global measure for on- time case processing. This will measure the percentage of cases resolved or finalised within established timeframes. The timeframes have been set having regard to the performance against the proposed measures over the last four years and in some categories are ambitious. The 22 accountability indicators have been reduced to nine indicators relating to the cost per finalised matter in each court and the case clearance rate for each court and ACAT. These indicators are likely to be of the most interest to the public. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 106 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Library review The ACTCT engaged a consultant to review the Russell Fox Library which manages the library collection, provides legal research and information services, manages public information through websites and social media and delivers a range of other library services. The review considered: the functions to be performed by modern court libraries, including the management of the collection, support to the Judiciary and tribunal members, educational activities, the use of social media and other functions the needs of the judiciary, members, practitioners and self-represented litigants; usage of services now and in the future management, governance and staffing structures for the Library necessary capabilities, work level standards and training for the staff of the Library administrative systems to prioritise activities, track workload and report on performance; business continuity arrangements opportunities for synergies or improved collaboration with other law libraries, particularly in relation to specialisation and mutual borrowing rights for collections. The report was delivered in late June and the ACTCT will consider the recommendations in 2018- 19. Development of a Drug and Alcohol Court During the year the ACTCT continued to engage with the project for the development of a Drug and Alcohol Court. The engagement was primarily through the Supreme Court Working Group. Work will continue during 2018 -19. Legislative reforms During the year, a range of legislative amendments commenced which affect the courts and ACAT . The largest reforms a rose from the Courts and Other Justice Legislation Amendment Act 2018 ('the Amendment Act') and the Residential Tenancies Legislation Amendment Act 2016 . The Amendment Act included amendments which increased the compensation limit for ACAT 's energy and water complaints jurisdiction to $25,000, clarified ACAT's powers and simplified appointment of health practitioner members. The Amendment Act also included amendments to the Coroners Act 1997 in relation to obtaining medical records, authorising routine non-invasive ancillary examinations, allowing a deputy coroner to authorise the release of a body and simplifying the process for authorising a person to assist in any examination. The Amendment Act included substantial reforms to the Juries Act 1 967 including changes to the list of people who may be disqualified, exempt or able to claim exemption from jury duty and to provide for reasonable support for jurors with a disability or with an insufficient understanding of the English language. The amendments to the Juries Act 1967 also allow for streamlined enforcement processes when people fail to attend for jury service. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 107 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The Residential Tenancies Legislation Amendment Act 2016 (the Act) included a range of residential tenancy reforms which affected th e ACAT. In particular, the Act included changes regarding the resolution of tenancies in situations involving family violence. Business Continuity During the year the ACTCT updated its business continuity plan and undertook a desktop test to assess its preparedness for dealing with events that might disrupt court or tribunal operations. Bevington workflow review A workflow review into the business processes of the bail office and protection unit was undertaken by Bevington Group. The review identified and mapped the time spent on over 1500 activities. It made a range of recommendations for improving the operation of these registry areas including redesigning forms to ensure all necessary information is captured in a clear and consistent manner, updating the checklists for key processes, moving to electronic data capture as close to source as possible, improving information for court users, and strengthening relationships with key stakeholders. Website redevelopment During the reporting year the ACTCT worked on the redevelopment of the Supreme Court, Magistrates Court and ACAT websites. The aim of the projects is to create websites that assist court and tribunal users to better access information and services relating to each court and ACAT. The new websites are expected to go live during 2018- 19. The ACAT website redesign is being undertaken by Shared Services ICT (SSICT) which has worked with ACAT staff to analyse the structure, accessibility and usability of the current website, and make recommendations about areas for change and improvement. The project identified common problems experienced by regular users of the website and how their needs could be better met. The architecture and design for the new ACAT website has been finalised and the updating of content continues. The court websites are being redeveloped to make them more intuitive and usable and to support new online service and information exchange options. A draft information architecture has been prepared and work is underway on updating the content for each website. Improved communication channels for court and tribunal users The ACTCT continued to improve its communication channels for court and ACAT users. During the reporting period, SMS notifications were introduced in the energy and water jurisdiction of ACAT to remind parties of upcoming hearings. It was also introduced in the Sheriff's Office to provide up to date information for jurors. Both initiatives have seen positive resul ts and the use of SMS will be expanded to other areas of the courts and ACAT in 2018- 19. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 108 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Jury Management The current ICT jury management system is over 15 years old and is used to support the processes for selecting jurors, managing juror payments and related matters. As the system has limited functionality and is no longer supported, arrangements are underway for it to be replaced. Following an unsuccessful attempt to procure a new jury management system from another Australian jurisdiction, other options were investigated and a new business case for a replacement system has been approved by Government with procurement to proceed in 2018- 19. Access to courts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people During the financial year the ACT Courts Cultural Diversity Committee endorsed the ACTCT 2017/18 Action Plan on Access to Courts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander People in the ACT. In addition, the Supreme Court adopted a Strategic Plan to Facilitate Access to the Court for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People in the ACT. Flowing from these plans, information on external legal and support services was developed for distribution from the court registry counters and court web sites. The judges and magistrates participated in a cultural competency development session on 18 October 2017 with Professor Sherwood from Sydney University. The judiciary also met with local Indigenous representatives throughout the year to keep abreast of issues affecting the local community. The Supreme Court, in partnership with the Education Directorate, held a Justice Careers Expo for Years nine - 12 students on 17 May 2018. Almost 50 students participated in the event which included a tour of the Supreme Court and meetings with judges, prosecutors, lawyers, correc tive services officers, sheriff assistants and a range of career advisors. A morning tea was followed by mock trials where students undertook a range of court roles. Supporting people with disabilities During the year information was developed for people with disabilities and a new role of Courts and Tribunal Assistance Officer was established to provide support for people with a disability who require further information or reasonable adjustments to access or use court and tribunal facilities. The new courts building has been designed to reflect contemporary design practice for people with a disability. Further information about the new building can be found at www.actlawcourtsproject.com.au. Supporting the culturally and linguistically diverse community Consultation with the culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) community is planned for 2018- 19 to obtain feedback from the community on how to improve access for family violence matters before the courts. The ACT Government's additional funding for interpreters for family violence matters has supported court staff to be proactive in helping CALD people to access the courts in this important area. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 109 Annual Report 2017 -2018 B.2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - OUTPUT 4.1 EMERGENCY SERVICES Output Description The ACT Emergency Services Agency (ESA) is responsible for the following emergency management strategies in supporting the ACT community: Prevention and Mitigation : Emergency prevention and mitigation measures are aimed to decrease or eliminate impacts on the ACT community and environment Preparedness: Emergency preparedness measures ensure that, in the event of emergency, communities, resources, and services can manage the impact Response: Response strategies and services are in place to control, and reduce consequences of emergencies Recovery: Recovery strategies are aimed to return the ACT community and ESA to a state of preparedness after an emergency situation.

This included: continuing to implement the ESA Strategic Reform Agenda (SRA) progressing the ACTAS Blueprint for Change progressing the Women in Emergency Services (WIES) Strategy progressing the SURP and ICT upgrades. Incident and Response Reporting For any single incident, multiple emergency phone calls may be received and ESA vehicles and staff may respond from across the services to ensure the best outcome. From 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018, ESA managed 64,031 incidents, an increase from 63,011 incidents in 2016- 17. These incidents included: 1,061 fire incidents; this number includes structure, vegetation and other fire types 52,426 medical incidents; this number includes ambulance and aero -medical incidents but excludes medical assists at fire, storm and rescue incidents to avoid duplicate reporting 1,147 rescue incidents; this number includes road rescues and search incidents 1,141 storm and flood incidents 8,256 other incidents; these included hazardous materials (Hazmat) and false alarms. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 111 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ESA Commissioner's Office Under the Emergencies Act 2004 , the ESA Commissioner has responsibility for the overall strategic direction and management of the emergency services, as well as for community education and improving community preparedness for emergencies. The Commissioner's Office manages lia ison and coordination within the ESA, as well as between the directorate, the Minister's Office and key stakeholders. ESA Commissioner Dominic Lane is the Commissioner of the ACT ESA, and brings with him 33 years of operational experience ranging from fire-fighter through to Commissioner, as well as 11 years in senior executive leadership and strategic management. His current role covers a wide portfolio including the strategic direction and management of all of the emergency services including the ACTAS, the ACTF&R, the ACTRFS and the ACTSES. Dominic was awarded the Australian Fire Service Medal in 2004 and the National Medal in 2005. Volunteer Charter The Volunteer Charter recognises and supports the role of volunteers within the ESA. In 2017, the Commissioner's Office liaised with volunteer organisations to update the ESA Volunteer Charter to closely align it with the ACT Volunteering Statement and ACT Public Service values and behaviours. It was signed by the Chief Minister, Minister for Police and Emergency Services, ESA Commissioner, ACT Volunteer Brigades Association, ACT SES Volunteers Association, Mapping and Planning Support Group, Community Fire Unit Consultative Committee and ACT Fire Brigade Historical Society. Figure 21 Volunteer charter Signing of the ESA Volunteer Charter Justice and Community Safety Directorate 112 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Emergency Media and Broadcasting Services The Emergency Media and Broadcasting Services section manages the delivery of news alerts, updates and warnings to the ACT community via the Single Point of Truth (SPOT) application during emergencies, proactively manages media opportunities and enquiries on behalf of the agency, and operates the ESA Facebook page and ESA Twitter platform. The ESA issued 292 news alerts, updates and warnings via the SPOT application in the 2017- 18 financial year. Examples of this include public safety advice and information during: A heavy rain event that impacted the ACT from 25 -26 February 2018. A total of ten news alerts were issued via SPOT to keep the community informed of, road closures due to flooding, how to receive emergency assistance, as well as general safety advice. During this event, hundreds of requests for help were received via 132 500 A Total Fire Ban in the ACT on 18 March 2018 which coincided with severe win ds that carried a dust storm into the ACT from Victoria. During this event, a hazard reduction burn on Potters Hill escaped containment lines and public information disseminated via SPOT kept the community informed of bushfire operations until the fire was extinguished on 20 March 2018. A total of 13 news alerts were issued about this event A gas main rupture that closed the intersection of Northbourne Avenue and Wakefield Avenue during peak hour traffic on 15 February 2018. Traffic diversions communicated via SPOT included visual maps to encourage the public to avoid the area while emergency services made the affected area safe. Six news alerts were issued about this event. An archive of news alerts can be viewed via http://esa.act.gov.au/community- information/publications/news-alert-archive/ . ESA Emergency Media executed a total of 46 proactive media opportunities during the 2017- 18 financial year via media launch and/or a media release. Initiatives communicated to the media included seasonal weather safety messages and reminders, the opening of new emergency service facilities, training and emergency preparedness exercises, recruitment, volunteer and staff recognition and awards, vehicle and equipment upgrades or replacements and general safety advice. The ESA's social media accounts, Facebook and Twitter, mirror the news alerts and also host feature style content to connect and interact with the community on a more personal level. The ESA Facebook page has more than 20,000 followers. A Facebook post about a fire in Beard on 17 June 2018, which included multiple photos, achieved the highest reach of 70,000 for the 2017- 18 financial year.

In November 2017 the ESA Commissioner established a specialised Internal Communications function to enhance engagement with staff and volunteer members. This was, in part, in response to feedback from staff and volunteers and the need to have a dedicated resource to communicate internally about major projects being delivered under the ESA Strategic Reform Agenda such as the ComCen Reform Project. The key objectives of the function is to improve the way internal communications are delivered to ESA staff and volunteers and to increase the amount and variety of internal communications products published. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 115 Annual Report 2017 -2018 This included the commencement of a trial of a new internal communications app, ESA Workforce Connect. The app was developed following the ESA's participation in the ACT Government's Digital Canberra Challenge competition. The competition facilitated engagement between ACT Government agencies and local business to find solutions to digital challenges. The ESA and Three72 Digital won Round Four of the challenge and went on to collaborate on the ESA Workforce Connect app. The new function has also seen the creation of an Internal Communications Working Group, a Manager, Internal Communications position and the creation of a new monthly digital publication, THE SNAPSHOT . Internal Communications Statistics ESA activities, milestones and achievements are reported daily to staff and volunteers across multiple digital platforms to accommodate the 24/7 shift patterns of our diverse workforce. Fresh content is published on the ESA intranet home page (for staff) and posted on the ESA Workforce Connect mobile phone app (for staff and volunteers). This included 62 videos published on the ESA Intranet home page between December 2017 and 30 June 2018. These videos were v iewed a total of 33,742 views.

Strategic Reform Agenda Strategic Objectives, Priorities and Performance An important component of the ESA Strategic Plan 2015-2020 is to provide effective and cohesive management of the organisation with a focus on changing priorities. The Strategic Reform Agenda (SRA) was formally launched by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services on 15 April 2015 and was established to deliver an integrated response to several reviews which impact the ESA and its service delivery. This outcome is being delivered by the SRA Program. Strategic Reform Agenda Program The SRA Program was announced formally in June 2016 with the key aim of implementing the SRA. The objective of the SRA is to ensure the ESA continues to provide the highest standards of Justice and Community Safety Directorate 116 Annual Report 2017 -2018 emergency services to the community through cohes ive operations, a collaborative management team and a unified Executive. Six reform projects were brought together under the SRA Program to progress this vision: Blueprint for Change: to enhance the professionalisation of the ACTAS workforce to provide a greater range of services and meet growing demand Women In Emergency Services (WIES) Strategy: the first step towards a diverse and inclusive workforce with the capacity to operate in a changing environment, whilst better reflecting the communities we serve Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Trunk Radio Networking (TRN): improved modern communications and dispatch technology enables our people to more effectively deliver their services ComCen Reform: a single communications centre meeting the needs of four op erational emergency services in the midst of variable demand levels to improve our services to the community Strategic Bushfire Management Plan (SBMP): achieving the complementary strategies by delivering the 71 actions of the SMPB. (Further information on the SBMP can be found under section O.1) Station Upgrade and Relocation Program (SURP): modern sustainable stations with amenities for a diverse workforce, and to improve our delivery of services to the community , by improved response times. The program coordinates, directs and oversees these projects, with a focus on the realisation of outcomes and benefits. It ensures that effective risk management is in place to deliver achievement of benefits related to the ES A's strategic priorities. The SRA Program, as identified in the original vision for the SRA, also enables another aspect of the directorate's strategic plan to be achieved - Accountability. The stated aim is \"to improve service delivery to the government of the day and the community through the continued monitoring of our performance against expectations\". It further states that \"We will be open and transparent in our transactions and delivery of all services and programs\". Programs are a significant commitment by any organisation and, in order to operate well, require the commitment and discipline of all the ESA staff and managers. The SRA Program enables the ESA's six reform projects to work as a coherent whole, adding value and consistency in delivery of the changes. This assists with benefit delivery and helps to break down the 'silos' which have so often been the cause of inefficiencies within the ESA. One of the most important added values of the SRA Program is the provision of overarching governance to the six projects, ensuring that the ESA fully meets the accountability defined in the JACS Strategic Plan 2017 -2019 . Benefits from the SRA program have been grouped in tranches for delivery. The first tranche of program benefits spanned from the launch of the program to 30 November 2017. Tranche 2 commenced 21 February 2018 and is scheduled for completion on 30 November 2018. This tranche will deliver further capabilities and benefits for the ESA and ACT community. Key benefits realised in Tranche 1 (1 Jun e 2016 - 30 November 2017) through to the first half of Tranche 2 (1 December to present) are outlined in the SRA project updates that follow. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 117 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Blueprint for Change The Blueprint for Change project will continue to deliver a variety of products to support an d enhance ACTAS' professionalisation and address workforce concerns around trust, conflict resolution and leadership. This work is a key priority for the ESA, which is committed to progressing actions collaboratively with staff and industrial representatives. The Transport Workers Union (TWU), representing ACTAS staff, has signed a joint accord with the ESA and ACTAS to collaborate and work proactively towards realising the objectives of the project. The objectives of the Blueprint for Change Implementation Project are to finalise the implementation of the Blueprint for Change report recommendations and to implement the highest priority and most strategically significant changes brought forward from staff consultation and engagement. Robust governance is provided by the Blueprint Oversight Committee, which is independently chaired by Mr. David Place from the South Australian Ambulance Service, who reports directly to the Minister on progress. Delivery of the 23 products of the Implementation Project progressed significantly in 2017- 18 with the following key initiatives completed: Mental Health and Wellbeing Plan Leadership Framework and ambulance recruitment guidance material Respectful Workplace and Difficult Conversations training Psychological First Aid tra ining Introduction of flexible work arrangements for part time work Implementation of an innovative Peer Support Program for ACT Ambulance. During 2018 -19, the following key activities and products are scheduled to be delivered: ACTAS Staff Development and Performance Framework Support for National Paramedic Registration transition Conflict resolutions guidance material. The project will also focus on operationalising the Leadership Framework by linking it to Personal Achievement and Development Plan's (PAD Ps), Leadership Training and Support, Staff Development and Performance and Talent Identification and Development initiatives. Development work is continuing on a series of Modernised Management and Service Delivery initiatives. The ultimate object of the project is to deeply embed professionalism as a cultural standard in ACTAS and equip the service to address challenges adaptively as they arise. The Blueprint for Change Implementation Project is expected to be finalised in 2019- 20. ComCen Reform The Communications Centre (ComCen) Project 9the Project) is implementing a \"One ComCen\" model for the ACT ESA Triple Zero (E000) Communications Centre, where, regardless of the type of emergency (e.g., medical emergency, bushfire, house fire, motor vehicle accident, storm), a call taker in the ComCen will have the capability to action the call. Under the current system, the ACTAS call taking function is undertaken by civilian call takers, while the ACTF&R call taking function is undertaken by trained fire fighters. Under the proposed reform, the ESA ComCen will transition to professional Emergency Triple Zero (E000) call- takers and Justice and Community Safety Directorate 118 Annual Report 2017 -2018 dispatchers for all types of calls, trained to national accreditation standards. This will allow qualified firefighters from the ComCen to return to frontline operations. The Project is being delivered in consultation with front line staff and industrial bodies including the United Firefighters Union (UFU) and the TWU. In order to deliver the project, the following key activities will be un dertaken: Recruitment of additional civilian call taking and dispatch staff, along with supporting quality assurance and training staff Redeployment of ComCen firefighters to operational duties, placed as appropriate with the newly recruited and qualified call taker/dispatch personnel Review and enhancement of nationally accredited training and development programs. Operational transition to the \"one ComCen\" model. The budget for the delivery of the Project is approximately $6.616m over four years, for the recruitment of additional civilian call takers and dispatchers to allow for the release of Fire and Rescue ComCen staff. A Workplace Consultation Committee has been established to manage the issues around the transfer of call taking functions to civilian call takers, with a strong focus on the impact of that transfer on firefighters. A Working Group with representatives from all services has been established to discuss and advise the Project Board on the various areas that will require attention and development in the gradual transition to the civilian call taker /dispatch model. An intake for additional call takers was conducted in April 2018, with those personnel due to complete their training early in the new financial year. A call for applications for a second intake was published in May 2018, with two intakes forecast for financial year 2018- 19. Station Upgrade and Relocation Program The ESA's Station Upgrade and Relocation Program (SURP) is about improving community safety for Canberrans whilst the city expands and the population grows. Strategically locating ESA stations to better service the needs and expectations of the community allows the ESA to continue to deliver high safety outcomes for the ACT. The current station upgrade program has been underw ay since November 2011 following a review of station locations in 2010. The priorities for the SURP were updated and confirmed by Government in April 2018. The revised priorities were informed by due diligence and feasibility studies, and response modelling supported by data analysis to identify optimal locations to ensure the maintenance of response times within targets. The SURP also supported the delivery of Personal Privacy and Dignity Upgrades (PPDU) and infrastructure upgrades during the reporting period as outlined in the following: Business Continuity Communications Centre and Non-Emergency Patient Transport In the 2017 -18 Budget, the Government announced funding for a replacement ESA Business Continuity Communications Centre (BC ComCen) and relocation of ACTAS Non- Emergency Patient Transport crews (NEPT). The relocation of the BC ComCen from Curtin to a refurbished facility in Hume is expected to be completed in 2018- 19. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 119 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Construction for the relocation of the NEPT from Curtin to a refurbished facility in Kambah was completed in June 2018 and crews will be operational in the second half of 2018. Majura SES Upgrade This upgrade, which includes a PPDU, plumbing and sewerage upgrades and asbestos remediation, started in May 2018. These works are expected to be complete in 2019- 20. Personal Privacy and Dignity Upgrade In support of the Women in Emergency Services (WIES) strategy the SURP program funded Personal Privacy and Dignity Upgrades (PPDU) at the ACTSES Majura, ACTRFS Guises Creek and the ACTRFS Molonglo units. These works provide facilities that support the changing demographic profile of the ESA through provision of equitable and appropriate facilities for female members including major renovations to change room areas. The upgrading of the ACTSES Majura Unit project has addressed immediate Personal Privacy and Dignity issues. A temporary toilet facility has been installed as well as some asbestos removal and remediation. An investigation into what is required to upgrade the Majura SES unit to a fit for purpose facility is currently underway. The infrastructure upgrade at the ACTRFS Guises Creek Unit included Personal Privacy and Dignity works as well as provision of an access toilet and the expansion of the multipurpose stand up and training room. The infrastructure upgrade at the Molonglo RFS Station included Personal Privacy and Dignity works that included toilets, locker rooms and expansion of the training room. The capacity of the appliance parking area was also increased to cater for additional vehicles if required. SouthCare Helicopter Base Toll Helicopters (NSW) Pty Ltd commenced operations in Canberra in April 2017. The SouthCare Helicopter Base houses the rostered flight teams that provide aeromedical services. An extensive refurbishment of the SouthCare Helicopter Base at Hume was completed in June 2018. Work included widening of the existing taxiway, a new helicopter landing strip and an extension to the hangar to make the Hume base fit- for-purpose for the new AW139 helicopter. Operational areas, including accommodation and catering facilities at the base, were also completely refurbished. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Upgrades The SURP successfully rolled out the ACT Government Wi-Fi network to all ACTF&R, ACTAS, ACTRFS and ACTSES stations, improving operational functionality and member amenity across the ESA. Tuggeranong SES Station The Government provided $2.756 million in capital funding over two financial years to construct a new station for the Tuggeranong ACTSES Unit at Calwell. The new purpose built station was officially opened in March 2018 replacing the ACTSES facility in Kambah. The facility was officially opened by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Mr Mick Gentleman MLA on 2 March 2018. A community open day was held at the site on 3 March 2018. It features environmentally sustainable design elements and training and operational areas which will help retain existing volunteer members and attract new ones. It is strategically located in the Canberra's south to meet the needs of the community now and well into the future. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 120 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 26 ACTSES Tuggeranong SES Strategic Bushfire Management Plan A Strategic Bushfire Management Plan (SBMP) is a requirement of the Emergencies Act 2004 . The SBMP is the overarching document that directs all levels of bushfire planning throughout the ACT. The SBMP Version 3 provides the strategic framework for government agencies with a responsibility for bushfire response and management (including the ESA, ACTRFS, ACTF&R, land managers and other ACT government agencies that support the community and emergency services) and underpins continuous improvement in bushfire management outcomes in the ACT. It is made up of 12 objectives and 72 recommendations. The SBMP defines the strategies by which the Commissioner and Chief Officers implement their roles and responsibilities. It also recognises the commitment and importance of other government agencies, community service organisations and local media and the role they have in land and bushfire management. The accomplishments of the SBMP during the 2017-18 financial year are contained in Annexure O of this report. Territory Radio Network Reform and Website Hosting Territory Radio Network (TRN) Upgrade Phase 2 and 3 The ESA has undertaken major upgrades at all of its Territory Radio Network sites, known as TRN- Phase 2. This included the expansion and replacement of site repeaters, antennas and backup power (UPS). To protect this investment, the ESA also took the opportunity to address power, cooling and safety issues at each site. The ESA commenced its program to replace its radio terminals in January 2017, known as TRN - Phase 3. Levering off the regional partnership with NSW Telecommunication Authority, the ESA identified the opportunity to engage all of Government Radio users and establish an all of Government contract for the supply and maintenance of portable radios. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 121 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Over 18 months the ESA consulted with all ESA services and other Government radio users, Including ACT Health, TSSC, Parks, ACTCS and Community services. The ESA conducted extensive trials of three pre-qualified radios and issued a public tender in September 2017. Following commercial negations, Harris was successful in their bid to supply the ESA and all of Government radio users. During 18- 19 FY of the radio project, the ESA will seek tender responses for suitably qualified vendors to replace all mobile (fixed installation) radios. To ensure the ESA front line responders are best placed to continue their outstanding service to the ACT community, the project team in consultation with the ESA services considered industry trends, improvement of radio technology, necessary encrypted systems and practical applications to ESA and other government radio user requirements. Achievements during 2017-1 8 include: All of Government Contract for the supply of Portable Radios All of Government approach to TRN expansion and integration Highly available GRN backhaul Reduced Telecommunication costs Figure 27 Bulls Head Tower Bulls He ad Tower Justice and Community Safety Directorate 122 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 28 Mt Tennant Tower Mt. Tennent Tower Website Hosting The ESA identified its website hosting and content management system project is a key initiative/project to be undertaken as part of the Strategic Reform Age nda. The project incorporates the review, redevelopment and redesign of the ESA website in order to improve its website experience for end users. Key areas of focus are: Content, Accessibility, Navigation and Design, Incident Mapping, Social Media, Analytics and Apps. In April 2018, Adelphi digital was selected as the preferred contractor to redevelop and redesign the ESA website. Phase 1 involved research of the user experience and was completed in June 2018. A research report on findings and recommendations has been provided. Phase 2, design of the new website commenced in July 2018. Women in Emergency Services Strategy The Women in Emergency Services Strategy (the Strategy) is intended to provide a pathway to a diverse and inclusive workplace across the ESA, enhancing the capability of the agency to be effective in a changing environment. The objective of the strategy, which was launched by the then Minister for Police and Emergency Services in November 2015, is to recruit more women into emergency services in the ACT, as well as supporting more women into leadership roles. During 2017 -18, a program for gender bias and stereotyping awareness training, kno wn as 'Insight' was developed and delivered to all managers within ESA. The program commenced November 2017 and concluded in May 2018. In July 2017 a significant step/commitment was made by the Commissioner who became an AFAC Male Champion of Change. The objective of the AFAC Charter for Male Champions of Change is to advance gender equity, inclusive cultures and achieve significant and sustainable improvements in the representation of women in their workplaces, including senior leadership positions, amongs t a paid and volunteer workforce. The ESA continues to progress towards achieving 50:50 recruitment in ACTF&R and the 2018 recruitment round resulted in a female success rate of 22 percent with four new female firefighters graduating. Continued focus in targeted recruitment methodology is expected to continue our Justice and Community Safety Directorate 123 Annual Report 2017 -2018 transformation towards this target. A legal challenge to ACTF&R's gender balanced target for 50:50 recruitment processes was dismissed by the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal in 2017. A key objective of the WIES strategy is to promote more women into leadership roles and the new Chief Officer of the ACT SES, Ms Georgeina Whelan took up her position during 2017- 18. Also of note this financial year is the development of a draft ACTF&R Pregnancy and Safe Work Policy and factsheet and progress towards a co-design workshop on flexible work arrangements. ACT Ambulance Service The ACTAS has a broad range of responsibilities under the Emergencies Act 2004 . The ACTAS is responsible for providing emergenc y, non -emergency and aero -medical ambulance services to the ACT community in addition to supporting the other emergency services in the delivery of their responsibilities. The ACTAS delivers these services from eight ambulance stations and the ComCen on a 24/7 basis, as well as from ESA Headquarters, ESA Training Centre and the SouthCare Helicopter facility at Hume. Under nationally agreed indicators, the ACTAS measures Priority 1 (E000) response times against 8 minutes or less (50 th percentile) and 15 minu tes or less (90th percentile). In 2017 -18, the ACTAS achieved an average response time of 9.1 minutes against the 50th percentile and 14.7 minutes against the 90th percentile. The less than target response times are attributed to the increased demand for ambulance services in 2017- 18. ACTAS Chief Officer Jon Quiggin retired from the role of Chief Officer in August 2017 after 14 months of service. The new Chief Officer, Howard Wren, was appointed to the role in November of 2017 following a national selection process. Prior to this appointment, he had been the Education Manager for ACTAS for over 20 years. Service Delivery The ACTAS continues to review operational performance to inform decisions on resource allocation (numbers and station location) to best mee t operational demand. The ACTAS maintains a record of each call received by the ComCen. Some incidents may be managed over the phone, with no ACTAS site response; some incidents will have multiple vehicles respond on site. In 2017-18, the ACTAS managed 52,426 incidents involving 53,345 responses by operational crews. Details of the ACTAS 2017-18 operational activity is provided in the below table. Table 29 ACTAS Operational Activity 2016 -17 2017 -18 Incident Type Incidents Responses Incidents Responses Medical (includes aeromedical) 49,875 50,383 52,426 Incidents 52,084 52,412 54,552 Community Safety Directorate 124 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 29 ACTAS ACT Ambulance Service ACTAS Capability The ACTAS conducted recruitment activities for emergency operations and non-emergency patient transport to fill positions that were vacant due to attrition. These recruitment activities assisted ACTAS to manage increasing demand for ambulance services. In addition, the ACT Government announced funding to support increased recruitment of frontline paramedic staff and vehicles. Funding for additional recruitment of frontline paramedics was announced in the 2017 -18 mid -year appropriation on 23 Decem ber 2017. This included eight extra paramedics to support leave provisions, and a further fifteen paramedics to come on line during 2018 -19. The eight extra paramedics have been employed, and offers of appointment have been made to another 15 applicants. Procurement of associated ambulance vehicles has also commenced. Following a successful trial and additional funding support from the ACT Government, ACTAS is introducing powered stretchers across the fleet. This introduction has commenced as part of the replacement of five emergency ambulances under the ESA vehicle replacement program, which replaces older vehicles on a scheduled basis in order to maintain a highly functional and safe fleet of vehicles. The remaining ambulance fleet will be progressively equipped with the new stretchers until early 2020. This initiative is expected to provide on-going workplace safety benefits, with a significant reduction in the requirement for ACTAS staff members to undertake repetitive loading and unloading of stretchers. SouthCare Helicopter The SouthCare helicopter aero -medical retrieval service is a joint venture funded by the ACT and NSW Governments, which provides aero-medical retrieval and rescue services to the ACT and surrounding region of south -east NSW. Funding for the service is provided on a joint basis with NSW, Justice and Community Safety Directorate 125 Annual Report 2017 -2018 with 90% of funding being provided by the NSW Government and the remaining 10% provided by the ACT Government. During 2017 -18, this life -saving aero-medical retrieval service flew 476 missions, which included inter-hospital retrieval, search and rescue, and pre-hospital primary taskings. In addition, 114 road retrievals were undertaken by the rostered flight team. Figure 30 Flight Crew Flight Crew To meet the requirements for t he new helicopter the hangar and base facilities have undergone a major review and upgrade. The new facilities provide the best environment to ensure safety and team work of the flight crew. Figure 31 Helibase Toll Helicopter at Helibase 2017-18 Highlights in ACTAS Joint Mass Casualty Exercise ACTAS and ACTSES conducted a joint mass casualty exercise at Exhibition Park in Canberra (EPIC) in June 2018. As part of the Territory- wide Emergency Management multi -agency preparedness pla ns, this exercise was designed to test some of the arrangements under the ACT Mass Casualty Plan. It also assessed internal procedures and interaction between ACTAS and ACTSES. In particular, the Justice and Community Safety Directorate 126 Annual Report 2017 -2018 exercise tested the integration of the innovative Ambulance Support Volunteer program developed within the ACTSES. This program utilises SES volunteers who have undertaken ACTAS specific familiarisation training to more appropriately support ambulance operations at a multiple patient incident. Other mass casualty exercises are planned for the future and will look to expand on the scenario to include other agencies. Figure 32 Joint Mass Casualty Exercise Mass Casualty Exercise ACTAS Leadership Framework A priority outcome from the Blueprint for Change program has been the development of a Leadership Framework for all ACTAS staff members. Within the framework, capabilities and expectations of all ACTAS employees, regardless of position or level, are clearly outlined in straightforward terms. Elements of the framework have already been utilised as part of the recruitment process for new staff. The implementation of all aspects of the Leadership Framework will continue to roll out during 2018 -19. Research In 2017 -18, ACTAS continued its research program, which aims to deliver high quality research that improves outcomes for our patients. ACTAS collaborated with world-class research organisations including the Australian National University (ANU), University of Canberra and Deakin University. This year, ACTAS research was published in national and international journals and presented at conferences. This work included cutting-edge research on pain management, sedation, detection of sepsis, and medical management of mass gatherings. ACTAS is able to provide professional research supervision to a limited number of undergraduate and postgraduate students from institutions such as the ANU and the University of Adelaide. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 127 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The General Manager of Quality, Safety and Risk Management is also providing on-site support for two doctoral candidates from ESA. The two candidates are studying issues related to pharmacological management of agitated patients, and aspects of paramedic diagnostic decision- making processes. ACT Fire and Rescue Under the Emergencies Act 2 004, ACTF&R is responsible for fire response in the built up area, rescue (road accident, vertical, confined space, trench, urban search and rescue), and chemical, biological, radiological hazardous materials incidents across the Territory. ACTF&R also performs emergency medical response in support of ACTAS. ACTF&R has responsibilities for fire safety of the built environment, fire investigation, and supports the other emergency services. ACTF&R delivers 24/7 services from nine stations and ESA ComCen, its Technical and Operational Support Section, ESA Training Centre and ESA Headquarters. ACTF&R also manages the Community Fire Unit (CFU) program, which consists of 50 units located in the urban bushland interface and includes approximately 850 volunteers. These residents are trained and equipped by ACTF&R to prepare and protect their properties in the event of bushfires, increasing the capability of fire crews deployed by ACTF&R and the ACTRFS. ACTF&R Chief Officer Mr Mark Brown ASFM has been the Chief Officer ACTF&R since July 2015. Chief Officer Brown has an extensive fire service background in areas including operations, training and capability development and prior to his appointment with ACTF&R he held the rank of Assistant Commissioner with Fire and Resc ue NSW. Service Delivery In 2017 -18, ACTF&R managed 10,597 incidents involving 21,385 responses by operational crews. Details of ACTF&R 2017-18 operational activity is provided in the below table: Table 30 ACT Fire and Rescue Operat ional Activity 2016 -17 2017 -18 Incident Type Incidents Responses Incidents Responses Fires Structure fires 271 1,395 260 1,247 Mobile property fires (vehicles) 264 448 291 490 Landscape fires, bush and grass 173 511 157 399 Other fires 253 558 256 502 Total Fires 961 2,912 964 2638 Other emergencies and incidents Hazardous conditions 501 1,131 430 1,019 Justice and Community Safety Directorate 128 Annual Report 2017 -2018 2016 -17 2017 -18 Severe weather & natural disasters 560 650 389 468 System initiated false 7,904 15,318 Non -fire rescue calls (including Road accident rescue operations 1,182 2,817 1,135 2,641 Medical assists 298 399 355 475 Other rescue (includes animal rescue) 179 247 239 313 Tota l Non -fire rescue calls (including road rescue) Figure 33 ACTF&R ACT Fire & Rescue There were over 3,492 automatic fire alarms (AFAs) connected and monitored in the ACT as of 30 June 2018. AFAs provide vital early warning to occupants and automatic notification to ACTF&R in higher risk premises such as multi-storey buildings, hospitals, shopping centres, schools, universities, nursing homes and government infrastructure. The total number of AFAs-initiated calls received by ACTF&R in 2017-18 was 5,517 (a decrease from 6,068 in 2016 -17), the vast majority of which were to premises where the subsequent investigation found there was no fire. The ACT rate of AFA calls is similar to other like jurisdictions. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 129 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ACTF&R Capability Operational Capability The Operational Capability section provides direct support to ACTF&R operations through the management of equipment and specialist capabilities such as breathing apparatus, uniforms and personal protective clothing, hazardous materials response, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response, technical rescue and interstate and international rescue deployment. Maintaining this capability is achieved by effective collaboration with support areas of the ESA and by working closely with other agencies. Operational Capability also develops long term strategies to ensure ACTF&R capability is maintained and remains appropriate for future needs. The section also provides advice, support and liaison roles to assist in managing the ACTF&R fleet, facilities, workplace health and safety and the ACTF&R requirements with support from the ESA ComCen. Figure 34 ACTF&R South Tuggeranong ACTF& R Vehicles Community Fire Units ACTF&R manages the Community Fire Unit (CFU) program, which consists of 50 units located in the urban bushland interface with approximately 850 volunteers. These residents are trained and equippe d by ACTF&R, thereby increasing the capability of fire crews deployed by ACTF&R and the ACTRFS. During 2017-18, ACTF&R introduced an on-line eLearning package for new CFU members and updated the hand-held radios used by CFUs. CFU members also participated in the Canberra Bushfire Ready campaign, doorknocking and talking to residents living in the bushfire prone area. 2017-18 Highlights in ACTF&R Major Multi -Agency Exercise ACTF&R coordinated a major multi-agency exercise on 18 June 2018 to test ACT plans to respond to a major structural collapse to test its response and Urban Search and Rescue capabilities. The exercise involved deploying specialised ACTF&R personnel to a mock collapse of a multi-storey car park, followed by the integration of interstate and overseas Urban Search and Rescue teams into the ACT Justice and Community Safety Directorate 130 Annual Report 2017 -2018 response. The deployment of these resources was managed by an incident management team working from ESA Headquarters. Women in Emergency Services Strategy As part of o ur commitment to the ESA's Women in Emergency Services Strategy, ACTF&R continues to focus on attracting more female firefighters as part of its 2017-18 recruitment campaign. This time 25% of the candidates selected were women and ACTF&R also recruited two Indigenous firefighters as part of the Indigenous Fire and Rescue Employment Strategy. Community Fire Unit Saturday CFU Saturday was held on 14 October 2017, and provided an opportunity for CFU volunteers to engage with their local communities, educating them about bushfire preparedness, as well as recruiting new members. Pialligo Estate Fire A major fire severely damaged the Pialligo Estate restaurant in October 2017. ACTF&R units were assisted by the ACTRFS. Darren Wal l Fun Run The Annual Darren Wall Fun Run was held by ACTF&R on 19 April 2018 around Lake Burley Griffin. This year the money raised was for Soldier On. ACT Rural Fire Service The primary function of the ACTRFS is to deliver services to protect and preserve life, property and the environment from fires in rural areas as directed in the Emergencies Act 2004 . The ACTRFS volunteers and staff operate out of eight brigade stations, ACT Parks and Conservation Service (PCS) facilities, Hume ACTRFS Helibase and the ESA Headquarters at Fairbairn. The ACTRFS is managed by the Chief Officer and 11 staff and is supported by 391 volunteer firefighters. The ACTRFS also has a close collaborative working relationship with ACTF&R, ACT Parks and Conservation Service (PCS) NSW Rural Fire Service (NSWRFS) and NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service (NSWP&WS) in combatting fires in and around the ACT region. ACTRFS Chief Officer Mr Joe Murphy has been the ACTRFS Chief Officer since June 2016 and is responsible for the general management and control of the rural fire service, matters relating to the professional and technical expertise of the rural fire service, operational planning for fire response in rural areas, including fire preparedness and contro l, and fire response in rural areas. Previous to this role, Mr Murphy was the manager of the ACT ESA Communications Centre and a senior firefighter with ACTF&R, an SES volunteer and a manager in a number of roles. Service Delivery In 2017 -18, the ACTRFS had 348 incidents involving 1,133 responses by members. Details of ACTRFS 2017 -18 operational activity is provided in the below table. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 131 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Table 31 ACTRFS Operational Activity 2016 -17 2017 -18 Incident Type Incidents Responses Incidents Responses Grass and bush fires 82 511 62 285 Smoke investigations 8 20 3 6 Vehicle fire 31 45 35 37 Motor vehicle accident 19 20 7 6 Storm/flood (assisting ACTSES) 378 424 116 159 Structure fires 3 5 3 5 Hazard reductions 29 216 25 325 Other fires/i ncidents 81 332 97 310 Total Incidents 631 1,436 348 1,133 Figure 35 ACTRFS ACTRFS at the Corin Fire ACTRFS Capability Response occurs from the eight volunteer stations (Guises Creek, Gungahlin, Hall, Jerrabomberra, Molonglo, R ivers, Southern and Tidbinbilla). ACTPCS have seven parks depots, and from mobile locations where crews are undertaking mitigation or area familiarisation activities. These locations provide for short response distances across urban and rural interface are as of Canberra. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 132 Annual Report 2017 -2018 In support of our crews and vehicles, there are 11 ACTRFS headquarters staff, fire weather analysts, media liaison officers, remote area firefighters, mapping specialists, communication specialists and a wider logistical and support capability that supports our crews in the field. To assist in the early detection of fires, the ACT has four fire towers that are staffed on days of high fire danger. Theses towers are located strategically around the ACT at One Tree Hill (North) Kowen Forest (Ea st), Mount Tennent (South) and Mount Coree (West). Table 32 ACTRFS Capability Brigade Members Number of Members Male Female Volunteers 391 320 71 Headquarters Staff 12 7 5 Total (including PCS) 597 472 125 ACTRFS undertook two in depth reviews of its volunteer membership within the 2017- 18. Prompted by the finalisation of the roll out of Working with Vulnerable People (WWVP) with the service, as well as a safety audit of all fire fighter helmets, the audits identified a large number of volunteer members who had resigned from the service or who were no longer active members. These volunteer members had departed over the proceeding four years but had not notified the service of their change in circumstance. The review outcome has resulted in a reduction of the total volunteer membership of the Service to a number that provides a more accurate reflection of the volunteer membership. With a total of 597 paid and volunteer members the RFS is well placed to protect the ACT community. Targeted recruitment campaigns will commence in 2018-19 to further enhance this capability. ACTRFS Firefighting Capabilities Table 33 ACTRFS Firefighting Capabilities Capability Details Remote Area Firefighting Team(RAFT) RAFT is dry firefighting in remote locations where vehicles cannot access and access is made via either walking or helicopter insertion. This capability allows very remote fires to be tackled, when conditions allow, using non water firefighting techniques. RAFT personnel from the ACT have been deployed across NSW and internationally to Canada to the 2017 British Columbia fires. Appliances with Compressed Air Firefighting Foam Systems (CAFS) The ACTRFS has six (6) CAFS units located around the territory. CAFS provides ACTRFS with the capability to extend water supply, by mixing with foam, smothering fires with a foam layer or putting down lines of foam to mitigate fire spread. The ACTRFS CAFS have also been used at landfill and rubbish fires in the ACT. Appliances and Heavy Tanker The ACTRFS maintains a fleet of light, medium and heavy tankers located at the eight (8) brigades. In support of this response fleet there are a bulk water carrier, command/support vehicles, quick fill/pump trailers, a retardant batching trai ler, a forklift and a tractor for the helicopter dolly. Aerial Firefighting Capability For the height of the ACT bushfire season the ACTRFS contracts two (2) helicopters, a small and a medium. Both helicopters are dual purpose with the small operating as an observation platform or water bombing and the medium as RAFT insertion or Justice and Community Safety Directorate 133 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Capability Details water bombing. The medium helicopter is contracted in partnership with NSWRFS. The aircraft are available to attend fires regionally in NSW. The aircraft are contracted via the Na tional Aerial Firefighting Centre. During and outside the contract period the ACT has access to additional aircraft via the NSWRFS State Air Desk. Plant for Firefighting Plant (dozers, graders, etc.) is available on contract during the declared bushfire season. Plant is typically used to construct fire breaks or access trails for tankers. Incident Management Capability The ESA conducted two half day Incident Management Exercises (IMX) in December 2017. The exercises prepared the ESA for the 2017- 18 fire s eason and targeted operations in bushfire and grassfire incidents. The exercise included multiple ACT response services and multiple affected jurisdictions, the exercises specifically tested cross jurisdictional incident management arrangements, communicat ions between the Operational, Tactical and Strategic Levels, and the establishment of multi -service, pre -formed Incident Management Teams (IMTs). The exercises also tested the effectiveness of the dissemination of information, warnings and advice, within Government and to the public utilising existing systems. In early 2018, ESA Training delivered a pilot program for an all hazards agency wide training and assessment pathway for ESA staff and volunteers, enabling certification to the national unit of competency for 'Control a Level 3 Incident'. A level three incident is characterised by degrees of complexity that may require the establishment of significant resources and structure for the effective management of the situation. Control refers to the overall d irection of emergency management activities at an incident. Authority for control is established in legislation or in an emergency plan and carries with it the responsibility for tasking other organisations in accordance with the needs of the situation. Implementation of Farm FireWise Plans A key prevention and mitigation initiative overseen by the ACTRFS is the Farm FireWise program. This continued across the Territory engaging leaseholders in developing bushfire mitigation and response measures as part of their lease agreements. The completion of Farm FireWise by the landholder is a requirement of the Emergencies Act 2004 and also to obtaining a Land Management Agreement with ACTPCS. More information is available in section O.1 Bushfire Risk Management. 2017 -18 Bushfire Season Under section 119 of the Emergencies Act 2004 , the ACT bushfire season commences each year on 1 October and runs through until 31 March. The Commissioner may declare a different date to be the beginning or end of a particular bushfire season if weather conditions warrant. The 2017- 2018 fire season started with predictions of very severe and dangerous conditions for the ACT community and surrounding areas. ACT experienced a dry winter and very little rain in the lead up to the season start on 1 October 2017. In the 2017 -18 bushfire season, two days of extreme fire danger resulted in Total Fire Ban (TOBAN) Declarations, on 14 February 2018 and 18 March 2018. On both TOBAN days the ACTRFS activated a preformed Incident Management Team, (IMT) consisting of members from ACTRFS, ACTF&R, ACTSES, ESA Risk and Planning and the ACTPCS. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 134 Annual Report 2017 -2018 During elevated fire danger periods our frontline firefighters were on a higher level of response at stations and aviation resources were on immediate deployment readiness. Throughout the season, the ACTRFS received twice daily weather forecast from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), these forecasts in consultation with ESA Risk and Planning assisted the ACTRFS in determining the fire danger rating and standby readiness for the ACT. During the 2017 -18 season, the ACTRFS declared the following number of fire danger ratings: Table 34 Fire Danger Ratings Fire Danger Rating Number of Declarations Low-moderate 111 High 65 Very high 30 Severe 2 Extreme 0 Catastrophic 0 Fires in the ACT In the 2017 -18 bushfire season incident numbers within the ACT were low despite the dry conditions. There were a total of 167 bush and grass classified fires in 2017-18. With the cl ose proximity of members to stations, quick response and the ability for the RFS and ACTF&R to deploy many vehicles, the majority of the fires in the ACT were kept to under 1 Hectare in size. A number of local fires of interest were: Table 35 Local fires Location Details Corin Dam 24th December 2018 Holt Grassfire on 14th February 2018 Brindabella Road Grassfire on 3rd February 2018 Power line Road - South of Piccadilly 7th February 2018 Bruce Ridge Four fires (all less than 1ha ) (The four fires also assisted the RFS in a course being conducted the week following these fires. ACTRFS hosted 9 AFP, 2 ACTF&R and 1 ACTRFS personnel who were trained in 'Determine origin and cause of wildfire'. All 12 participants were taken to the 4 locations on Bruce Ridge and assessed on their investigation skills.) Potters Hill Potter Hills was a hazard reduction burn that broke containment lines on the 18 March 2018 which was declared a TOBAN.

Simpson's Hill, Chisholm Grass fire on 2nd April 2018 2017-18 Highlights in ACTRFS Hazard Reduction ACTRFS assisted ACTPCS with their annual hazard reduction program. This included participating in Bushfire Operational Plan (BOP) cultural-ecological burns where traditional burning methods are used to introduce fire into the landscape. A Cultural-Ecological burn is designed and implemented for a specific purpose or purposes. A primary purpose of any such burn is cultural renewal. Outcomes that may be achieved that compliment this outcome include (but are not limited to): Renewal of native vegetation Safeguarding culturally significant sites Hazard reduction Maintaining the health of groundwater sources and water catchment areas. Cultural- Ecological burns and generally known as 'cool burns'. They are generally of low -intensity and severity. Cultural burns take place within a traditional seasonal calendar indicated by certain native flora and fauna species. Burns are generally lit from multiple ignition points, often without the use of accelerants (drip -torches) and 'creep' or 'trickle' throu gh the surface, near -surface and elevated fuel layers with very little to no crown scorching (under 10% when lit in a forested area). In addition, the ACTRFS participated in hazard reduction burns on behalf of the National Capital Authority and ecological research burns located in several locations within the Parliamentary Triangle, ACT. ACT and NSW Memorandum of Understanding and Mutual Aid Agreement ACTRFS hosted cross-border briefings with staff, and senior volunteers from NSWRFS and NSW Office of Environment and Heritage to maintain the Memorandum of Understanding and Mutual Aid Agreement. Community Engagement ACTRFS maintained involvement in community engagement initiatives including the 2018 Royal Canberra Show and attendance at various school and community fetes. Emergency Services Open Day ACTRFS coordinated the Emergency Services Open Day at the ESA Headquarters, Fairbairn, on Sunday 29 October 2017. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 136 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Pre-season Briefings ACTRFS hosted the pre-season briefing on 26 September 2017 and also attended the NSWRFS pre- season briefing to ensure continued integration for fire management at a District, Regional and State level. Canberra Bushfire Ready Campaign ACTRFS coordinated the delivery of the Canberra Bushfire Ready (CBR) Campaign in the ACT in 2017-18 wi th ESA volunteers and staff participating in door knocking events and community meetings. Figure 36 CBR Bushfire Ready CBR Bushfire Ready Banner Justice and Community Safety Directorate 137 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 37 ACTRFS doork nocking for CBR Bush fire Ready ACT State Emergency Service The ACTSES is established under Section 56 of the Emergencies Act 2004 and has a broad range of legislative responsibilities. The primary function of the ACTSES is to undertake planning and respons e operations for storms and floods and to support other emergency services. The ACTSES is a predominantly volunteer emergency service organisation which gives assistance to the community during emergencies and engages with the community on a regular basis in order to provide public education on emergency matters, and to attract volunteer members. As of 30 June 2018, there were 325 ACTSES volunteers who provide emergency response to the community. The diversity of ACTSES volunteers and the experience of their career and life balance, greatly enhances the capability of the service. Of these, 295 are considered 'active' members able to respond as requested 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 138 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 38 ACTSES ACTSES Volunteer respondi ng to call for assistance ACTSES Chief Officer In October 2017, Brigadier Georgeina Whelan AM, CSC and Bar was appointed as Chief Officer of the ACTSES, the first permanent female member of the ESA Executive. Georgeina is a highly respected senior executiv e, with over 30 years' experience in senior leadership and executive roles in the Australian Defence Force. Since her appointment, Ms Whelan has provided strong and well regarded leadership and is making a positive impact producing excellent results. Addit ionally, Ms Whelan recently qualified as a Level 3 Incident Controller and has capably led a number of Incident Management Teams as Chief Officer, ACTSES. Service Delivery During the 2017 -2018 reporting period, the ACTSES received 1,417 requests through the SES request line (ph 132 500) for assistance related to storm and flood damage. ACTSES was supported by ACTF&R, ACTRFS and TCCS field teams in responding to and mediating a number of these requests for assistance. During the reporting year 2017-2018 ACTSES established four Incident Management Teams to control larger storm and flood incidents that required a multi-agency response. The two most significant events resulted in 201 requests for assistance following a storm impact in January 2018, and flash flooding operations resulting in 279 request for assistance in February 2018. The ACTSES provides continued support to ACT Policing, other emergency services and other ACT Government departments with specialist capability such as lighting towers, flood boats, urban search teams and vehicle recoveries. During operations the ACTSES volunteers provide specialist communications support across the emergency service sector. ACTSES volunteers also provide a range of support and assistance to ACT Ambulance Service. In the 2017 -2018 period the ACTSES deployed the field hospital and the mass-casualty incident trailer during operations and in support of four major mass gathering community events. ACTSES volunteers also provided support to ACTAS accessing and retrieving an injured bushwalker in rural ACT. Additionally, ACTSES undertook 36 support to operations activities some of which occurred over a number of days.

In line with the concept of 'volunteering for life', in 2017 the ACTSES established an additional volunteer group from the existing cohort to support the service across the areas of preparation, planning and response. The new group comprises of: Peer Support Team - to provide welfare support and assistance Community Education Team - to plan, prepare and inform the vo lunteers, the community and partners in understanding risk and the relevance of taking action before, during and after the emergency events Moulage Team - to provide support to realistic training scenarios for all emergency services agencies both local and national Operations Support Team - highly skilled and experienced operators who provide coaching, guidance and mentoring to the ACTSES Unit leadership and who lead operational training and leadership development The volunteers are managed by eight employe d staff, each with multiple portfolios to ensure that our personnel are well trained, equipped and supported for operational duty. The ACTSES maintains a number of specialist roles and equipment on behalf of the ESA in support of the broader emergency services sector. Flood and Storm Planning and Capability The ACTSES is responsible for two key sub-plans of the ACT Emergency Plan: the ACT Storm Plan; and the ACT Flood Plan. These plans are supported by the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NSW SES for joint training and operations, the standard operating procedures and policies to give guidance for volunteers and staff during decision making, and Operational Aide Memoirs (OAM) to outline the procedures for operational process and duties. The ACTSES has the capacity to respond to flood and storm Requests for Assistance (RFAs). The volunteers maintain their competence in core skills such as Undertake Storm and Water Operations, to ensure they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to safely and appropriately provide temporary repairs. A number of members are also competent in supplementary skills such as chainsaw operations and first aid. An effective storm operational response calls for a holistic approach from across the whole of ACT Government. ACTSES uses the skills and experience of ACTF&R, ACTRFS and TCCS teams to conduct temporary repairs. The SES hotline is managed by both ESA ComCen and Access Canberra. With the Justice and Community Safety Directorate 141 Annual Report 2017 -2018 continual improvement of ICT capabilities the management of RFAs will become a more streamlined process. The ACTSES has specialist flood equipment on hand to respond to different flooding types in the ACT. This includes: 20 x portable pumps; 1 x high capacity pump (6000 litre per minute); and 240m of portable flood barriers for water dive rsion or capture. Additionally ACTRFS quick fill pumps may be utilised to assist with minor flooding. The ESA Resource Centre maintains 1000 sandbags ready for deployment and there is approximately 600 sandbags ready for use across the ACTSES Units. All ACTSES Units are trained and equipped to conduct land based flood rescue. This includes every vehicle having two throw bags and two life jackets, with training conducted regularly. Additionally the ACTSES maintains two flood rescue boats with trained and end orsed members across various Units. The boat crews predominately provide assistance to community water based events, support the ACT Water Police in community events, in operations for search, safety and rescue purposes, and provide assistance to ACTRFS for hazard reduction burns around Lake Burley Griffin. Search - Land, Air, Water In support of ACT Policing, land search is the second biggest request for assistance for the ACTSES volunteers after flood and storm. Volunteers maintain their search and navigation skills through specific training. Additionally volunteers are required to maintain a moderate or arduous fitness level for the majority of land search requests. The search capability is further supported by both air and water. The ACTSES has a small t eam of air observers who train with Australian Maritime Safety Authority to maintain their skills for searching over long periods of time as self-rescue. 2017-18 Highlights in ACTSES ACTSES Representation at the National Disaster Rescue Challenge Seven mem bers of the Gungahlin SES Unit, represented the ACTSES at the National Disaster Rescue Challenge held in Hobart, November 2017. The team were challenged in six different storm, flood and land search scenarios typically encountered by an SES volunteer. The spirit of the challenge saw the team network with members representing other jurisdictions to learn new techniques and share ideas. The ACTSES representative team was awarded 4 th place. New Facility in Tuggeranong In March 2018, the Tuggeranong SES Unit facility was officially opened by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services. The Tuggeranong SES Unit, based in Calwell, was built as part of the ESA Station Upgrade and Relocation Program, which improves community safety for Canberra's residents whilst the city expands and the population grows.

The rapport established with other jurisdictions in all types of emergencies will assist the ACT in seeking support when faced with any major emergencies of its own in future. The experience and lessons learnt from these deployments also helps to ensure our own capability is well tested and prepared. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 143 Annual Report 2017 -2018 In July and August 2017, the Canadian Inter-agency Forest Fire Centre requested Australian assistance in response to an escalating bushfire situation in British Columbia. ACT personnel from the ACTRFS, ACTPCS, and ACTF&R, provided assistance as part of an Australian deployment. At any one point a maximum of 41 ACT personnel were deployed to Canada, with ACT personnel making up 22 per cent of the entire Australian deployment. The Canadians were very grateful for the assistance from Australian firefighters. Australian personnel were also welcomed by those affected in what was a long, personal and destructive fire season Rural Fire Support Crews from the ACTRFS supported interstate colleagues during the season on multiple occasions. ACTRFS supported other jurisdictions in various skill sets for example: resource management, ground crews, Remote Area Firefighting Team (RAFT), aviation and IMT roles. This season the ACTRFS assisted cross border agencies with the following incidents: Table 38 Incidents Location Details Nerrig a Road 20th and 21st January 2018 Long Gully Road, Bannaby 23rd - 27th January 2018 NSWRFS State Strategic Planning Unit NSWRFS assembled the State Strategic Planning Unit at NSWRFS HQ Homebush, Sydney on 25 January 2018 to determine state-wide sharing of finite resources for the many fires in NSW.

Justice and Community Safety Directorate 150 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ACT Fire & Rescue The Firefighter Training and Development section is responsible for the delivery of training, particularly in relation to skills acquisition, as well as officer development programs. ACTF&R provides specialist skills training, with training meeting the requirements for the awarding of nationally -recognised qualifications under the Public Safety Training Package. In addition to on-shift training activities, ACTF&R personnel undertook 92,887 hours of face- to-face training during the 2017 -18 reporting period; this included the delivery of a recruit college and a Station Officer Development Program and Commander Development Program. During 2017 -18, the Firefighter Training and Development section was responsible for training 26 new firefighters in the ACT, 17 from a community-based recruitment, who undertook 20 weeks of training, and nine from a lateral recruitment initiative, who undertook an eight week induction and orientation program. In addition to these programs, the Firefighter Training and Development section also delivered development programs for selected officers to be promoted to Station Officer and Commander ranks. ACT Ambulance Service The ACTAS continues to deliver training and education to support vocational qualifications, the induction of tertiary qualified graduate paramedics and comprehensive in- service programs. During the year, ACTAS has successfully delivered vocational training programs for two intakes of call-takers, ACTAS continues to deliver training and education to support vocational qualifications, the induction of tertiary qualified graduate paramedics and comprehensive in-service programs. During the year, ACTAS has successfully delivered vocational training programs for two intakes of call-takers, two intakes of graduate paramedics, one program for paramedics who have laterally transferred from other Ambulance Services and delivered in-service training and education for in excess of 250. Other activities include the provision and facilitation of inter-service training for ACTF&R (Stage 1, 2 and 3 rescue triaging and support to Recruit College 39) and the Australian Federal Police (remote area care), the training and assessment of five intensive care paramedics, support to undergraduate and post graduate university students and ten professional development days for employees returning to work from extended absence. ACT Rural Fire Service ACTRFS training programs are conducted at brigade, service, agency and sector levels to deliver effective, efficient and safe operations within community-based and station activities. In addition to courses that ACTRFS runs to build and maintain core firefighting capabilities (including Basic Firefighter, Advanced Firefighter, Crew Leader, Incident Management Team (IMT) functional positions, Divisional Commander, Village firefighter, chainsaw operator and 4WD) a new course in Icon (ACT/NSW bushfire incident management system has been introduced. The successful training of ACTRFS volunteers occurs due to the generosity of ACTRFS members who provide their time, expertise and enthu siasm on evenings and weekends. ACT State Emergency Service Training is a core activity for maintenance of skills, and optimising capacity and capability of the service to respond to storm and flood. In 2017- 2018 , the ACTSES continued to refine the trainin g program to ensure a continuous cycle of improvement and innovation. A collaborative training model was introduced which saw Units establish a cycle of collective training in order to spread the training Justice and Community Safety Directorate 151 Annual Report 2017 -2018 load, introduce variety and ensure maintenance of national competencies across the whole of the ACTSES. Figure 46 ACTSES ACTSES Field Hospital Training (supporting ACTAS) Recruitment ACTAS Recruitment During the reporting period, ACTAS recruited 40 additional staff across a variety of disciplines. New staff included Graduate Paramedics, Non-Emergency Patient Transport staff, Emergency E000 Call Takers and a cohort of trained lateral paramedics. Government funding will deliver additional frontline staff in the next reporting period. ACTF&R Recruitment In the 2017 -18 ACT Budget, the Government funded an ACTF&R recruitment program - Recruit College 39. Recruit College 39 resulted in an additional 17 firefighters on duty in June 2018 including two IFARES recruits and four women recruit s. The recruitment program actively encourages female participation in line with the Women in Emergency Services Strategy and promotes opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to join ACTF&R as firefighters. Funding for a further recruit college was announced in the 2018-19 ACT Budget. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 152 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ACTRFS Recruitment The ACTRFS continued its program of recruitment in the 2017-18 financial year. In September 2017, the ACTRFS trained 33 new members, with a further 21 new members trained in March 2018. Volunteer recruitment remains a core activity, with recruit training for more new members planned for September 2018. ACTSES Volunteer Recruitment Training new members is vital for the sustainment of the ACTSES and to continue to build capacity and capability in support of the community. In the 2017-2018 period, the revised format of the Recruit College enabled 63 new Recruits to be trained and placed across the seven ACTSES Units. This intake of new members of which 46% was female was the single largest recruitment undertaken by the ACTSES. The Recruit training program was conducted centrally, with the current members playing a significant role in training the new recruits within the collaborative training framework. Up on completion of the Recruit College program, the new recruits received training in the skills required to support the ACT Community in flood and storm response and in support of other emergency services. Staff Welfare From February 2017, the establishment of the ESA Manager Welfare Programs continues to provide a dedicated person to build on the work undertaken in the ACTAS Blueprint for Change and to develop staff wellbeing and welfare programs for all staff and volunteers in ESA. During the reporting period, the Manager Welfare Programs has developed and facilitated the first ACTAS Peer Support Training, resulting in 13 Peer Support Officers (PSOs) being available for ACTAS since May 2018. Further cohorts of Peers Support Officers will be trained for ACTAS and ACTSES by December 2018. Working with beyondblue , all Services in ESA have participated in the voluntary National Survey on Mental Health and Wellbeing of Police and Emergency Service Personnel, with the aim of the survey being to explore the effecti veness of mental health programs in our workplaces and make improvements. ESA is expecting the outcome of this survey in October 2018. Peer Support Officers As part of the on-going Blueprint for Change program within ACTAS, the first group of PSOs were com missioned in May 2018. This program equips selected staff members from all parts of the organisation to provide initial support to colleagues to assist with the challenging situations faced by ACTAS personnel. Early indications are that the program is greatly valued and utilised extensively. A second group of peer support officers will be trained in August 2018. Risk and Planning The Risk and Planning Business unit was established in 2016 under the Strategic Reform Agenda (SRA). Risk and Planning brings together key service delivery areas supporting frontline services including Emergency Management, Risk, Spatial and Digital services, ComCen, Community Resilience (Fire Safety) and ICT. The individual areas work collaboratively to provide specialist support to the directorate, ESA Commissioner, the four operational emergency services and external agencies working together to protect the community Justice and Community Safety Directorate 153 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Director, Risk and Planning David Foot ASM commenced as the Director, Risk and Planning in early 2016 after his appointment was announced on 4 November 2015. Mr Foot brings significant experience to the position with over 30 years of executive and operational experience in emergency services. 2017- 18 Highlights ESA Risk and Planning undertook a range of activities in 2017-18 to support ESA's operational preparedness and response capabilities. Highlights are outlined below. ComCen Achievements in 2017 -18 included: On 1 July 2017, Risk and Planning assumed responsibility for the E000 ComCen function, this was the first major step towards a One ComCen model for the ESA Completion of major upgrades at all ESA Trunk Radio Networking sites. These works have included the expansion and replacement of site repeaters, antennas and backup power (UPS) Awarding of the tender for Stage 1 of TRN II, and engagement of Harris Communications to supply portable radio terminals on a whole of government approach. This followed an 18 month consultation with all ESA services and other Government radio users, including ACT Health, TSSC, Parks, Corrections and Community services. Recruitment of new staff to the ESA Communications Centre team including the new ESA ComCen Manager Mr Jeff Butler, new call takers, and the inter -agency team with members recruited from ACTF&R and ACTAS. Spatial and Digital Services The Spatial and Digital Services team provides ESA with a specialist capability which incorporates the collection and analysis of data from a number of sources which is then used to deliver real time operational information, intelligence and capability development to support front line services and the wider community. Specialist areas include the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system, mobile applications such as the Common Operations Picture (COP), web and conten t management services, mapping and Geographic Information Services (GIS). Achievements during 2017- 18 included: Development and awarding of the Website Hosting and Content Management Tender, which incorporates the supporting ICT architecture and upgrading of websites including ESA, ACTCS, ACTCT, the ACT Government Solicitor and the Eastman Enquiry Refinement of mobile ready technology platforms to collect, consolidate and report on Rapid Damage Impact Assessments and Combustible Cladding Design and construction of the 'flood study information portal' (FSIP), a whole of government one stop shop for all custodians of flooding information. The FSIP brings together modelling data, dam safety plans, flood plans, development flood reports and community education materials into a single portal. FSIP is also the new home for all flood committees and working groups to record and monitor actions and meeting documents Development of electronic architecture supporting the commissioning of Electronic Fire Danger signage in the community Justice and Community Safety Directorate 154 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The update and validation of all key mapping layers used in the ESA's computer aided dispatch system. Community Resilience Every year, the ACT faces the impacts that bushfires, floods, storms and other hazards have on the community. As per the National Strategy for Disaster Resilience's resilience- based approach, the Community Resilience section, which includes specialist ACTF&R staff, provided high level support to the ACT community during the 2017-18 reporting period, including: Review of 191 Development Applications Provision of specialist advice both within ESA and across Government in a range of areas including Events Management, Liquid Fuels legislation, Waste Management and Recycling, Climate Change Adaptation Working Group, Greenfield and Special Fire Protection Developments Provision of nine dedicated programs for Mapping Volunteers aimed at enhancing their knowledge when utilised for bushfire and missing persons searches provision of specialist support from ESA MAPS Volunteers on 14 occasions including: o 10 Search & Rescue operations o Two bushfire events, and o Two inclement weather pre -emptive Incident Management Team (IMT) standbys. Provision of Bushfire Prone Area Mapping results to inform Canberra Bush fire Ready Campaign community doorknock. Risk and Planning presented the body of work undertaken to develop AutoBAL to the 2017 AFAC Conference in Sydney. AutoBAL incorporates the use of LIDAR to 'map' a range of factors that are used to calculate Bushfire Attack Levels e.g. proximity of structure to vegetation, type of vegetation (grass/forest/woodland), slope and distances. Community Engagement ACT Ambulance Service Extreme heat preparedness In 2017 -18, as the lead agency responsible for the Extreme Heat Plan, the ACTAS continued to provide information to increase awareness of extreme heat health risks and avoiding heat stress. The effects of heatwave is the second highest identified risk in the 2017 Territory Wide Risk Assessment . Events such as the ESA Open Day, the Canberra Show and the SES Open Day were some of the community platforms used to increase community knowledge and awareness. The Extreme Heat fact sheet and Emergency Medical Information forms are available on the ESA website. The ACTAS participated in a range of additional health and community events or programs, such as the Special Children's Christmas Party, the ACT Health Party Program, the ACT Careers Expo and school and community group visits by ACTAS Officers in their own time. Patient Experience Each year the ACTAS participates in a national survey with all other Australian ambulance services seeking feedback from patients, or the carers of patients, who have been provided with emergency treatment and transport in the two months preceding the survey. Key objectives of the survey are to Justice and Community Safety Directorate 155 Annual Report 2017 -2018 benchmark perceived service quality and customer experience levels across all state and territory ambulance services. During 2018, 1300 surveys were sent out to randomly selected patients. The survey results are collated nationally and the outcomes are published after the end of the financial year. In the 2017 survey the ACTAS achieved an overall patient satisfaction of 97%. Overall satisfaction for all Australian services was also 97%. This was a decrease from 98% in 2016 for both the ACTAS and nationally. International Restart a Heart Day Restart a Heart Day is an international Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillators (AED) awareness campaign that was initiated in Europe and is held on 16 October each year. The campaign aims to improve bystander participation in early CPR and defibrillation through the use of face- to-face education and social media. In support of the international campaig n the Council of Ambulance Authorities (Australia and New Zealand) received support from 10 Australian and New Zealand Ambulance Services to participate in the 2017 campaign. It was a national collaboration with the aim to improve out of hospital cardiac a rrest outcomes throughout Australia and New Zealand. Following a launch at the ACT ESA Training Centre at Hume, ACTAS, Australian Catholic University and St John Ambulance staff taught CPR and provided AED training or awareness to 840 students and staff across 7 primary and 2 secondary schools in the ACT. The ACTAS web-site, a national web-site, ESA Twitter and Facebook were used to promote the event and provide educational material more broadly. ACT Fire & Rescue Community Fire Unit Saturday Community Fire Unit Saturday, which was conducted on 15 October 2017, is a program delivered by ACTF&R CFU volunteers and staff members annually. The program, which is delivered in CFU local areas and adjacent shopping centres, is designed to help educate the Canberra community on a number of topics, including the dangers of bushfire and the preparatory steps ACT citizens can take to help protect their properties from bushfire such as: reduction in flammable overgrowth general tidiness of yards in the urban interface zon es protective measures to limit the impact of fire and ember attack the presence and role of the local CFUs in their neighbourhoods. CFUs not only assist to protect interface properties in specific higher risk areas but are a valuable educational resource due to their training and association with ACTF&R. Fire Safety Education Campaign In 2017 -18, ACTF&R successfully delivered the annual Fire Safety Education Campaign (Fire Ed) to over 5,700 kindergarten students in ACT schools. The aim of the Fire Ed Program is to provide students with fun, practical and essential information on fire safety and what to do if a fire starts. ACTF&R starts teaching fire safety to children from a young age to ensure that children and their families are safe at home. Students are educated in a 45- minute lesson delivered by front- line firefighters. The session highlights the importance of: Justice and Community Safety Directorate 156 Annual Report 2017 -2018 knowing how to call Emergency Triple Zero (000) 'Stop, Drop and Roll' to extinguish burning clothing 'Getting Down Low' when smoke is inside a home showing students they do not need to be afraid of firefighters in full personal protective gear. The lesson gives ACT students a chance to sit in a fire truck and see the equipment used to save lives. ACTF&R annually invites all kindergarten classes in the ACT to take part in Fire Ed. Figure 47 Fire Safety Education Campaign ACTF&R with a class ACT Rural Fire Service ACTRFS takes the lead on the ESA Open Day 2017 ACT Emergency Services Open Day, held on Sunday 29 October 2017, was an extremely successful event enjoyed by over 5,000 visitors. This was the first time the event has been held at the ACT Emergency Services Agency (ESA) Headquarters in Fairbairn. Hosting the Open Day at this site allowed the ESA to showcase a whole range of emergency management activities. ESA volunteers and staff are very proud of their roles, and spoke passionately about the work they perform. The event was also an opportunity for the community to meet the people who keep them safe, and for the community to learn about how they can take care of what matters during an emergency. ESA provided tours of facilities, allowing the public into the Incident Management Room, Emergency Coordination Centre, Planning Room, Media Room, and the ESA Workshop. These tours proved to be extremely popular, as was all the equipment on display, and the skills demonstrations by ESA volunteers and staff. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 157 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 48 ESA Open Day ESA Open Day CBR Bushfire Ready Community Education Campaign To support building the resilience of Canberra households in the Bushfire Prone Area, the Canberra Bushfire Ready doorknock campaign was developed in 2014, and has been implemented every bushfire season since. It involves the delivery of a targeted message by emerge ncy service volunteers and staff to Canberrans living near the urban bush interface to prepare their homes, property and families to respond to bushfires and natural disasters. The CBR Bushfire Ready campaign in 2017-18 highlighted the positive influence of delivering community education in an integrated and coordinated approach. With a focus on reaching out to older Canberrans and their carers as well as the general community, this season's doorknock campaign reached a total 1000 residences across 25 suburbs as well as the rural communities of Tharwa, Uriarra and Hall. This has encouraged the ACT community to take greater responsibility for their safety by acting on information, advice and other cues provided before an emergency. ACT State Emergency Service In 2017 -18, ACTSES completed 102 Community Engagement events. Of these events 25 were targeted educational visits conducted at Schools, Scouts Groups and with the Cultural and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) Community. These interactive presentations and displays are tailored to suit the particular group needs. The presentation also focus on delivering information about the ACTSES, ESA and how to best utilise the emergency numbers 132 500 and Triple- Zero. Other key areas of focus include building community resilience through preparing our community to respond before, during and after a flood. The ACTSES volunteers participated in a range of community events including Skyfire, ANZAC Day, New Year's Eve and a range of ACT Government supported events. During the se activities the volunteers undertake a range of roles such as assisting with car park marshalling, communications support and in assisting ACTAS at large community events. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 158 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Legacy Gutter Cleaning The annual Legacy Gutter Cleaning Campaign in August and September 2017, saw 58 individual homes attended to by the ACTSES volunteers supporting the legacy widows. Volunteers visit each home and help the widow to prepare their homes for the wet weather, heat and other natural hazards. Volunteers provided support through cleaning gutters, trimming hazardous trees and providing education on what to do before, during and after a storm and how to use the emergency service numbers. This campaign continues to build a strong partnership between ACTSES and Legacy House Can berra and helps support vulnerable Canberrans. National Disaster Rescue Challenge The ACTSES Gungahlin Unit represented the ACT in the biennial National Disaster Rescue Challenge, held in Hobart, Tasmania in November 2017. The team participated in a range of challenging scenarios in storm, flood, search and navigation activities testing their basic skills and lateral thinking. The challenge gives the ACT the opportunity to collaborate and interact with teams from across Australia to consolidate learnings and techniques and to gain confidence for interstate taskforces. The ACT team placed a respectable 4th place, with the larger states and territories of NSW, South Australia and the Northern Territory on the winners' podium. The next challenge in 2019 will be held in NSW. StormSafe Campaign In September 2017, the ACTSES conducted the annual StormSafe campaign and season launch. The campaign was delivered through five displays at local Bunnings Stores interacting with the public and providing advice on home preparation and maintenance. Additionally the StormSafe campaign utilised various social media platforms including interactive videos with the launch of the 'StormSafe Tips with Twisty' videos. Throughout the month long campaign, the videos were viewed over 2 000 times through social media with a total reach of 12,945 people and more than 4500 people were spoken to face to face at the displays. Figure 49 ACTSES SES StormS afe Launch Justice and Community Safety Directorate 159 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Security and Emergency Management Branch The Security and Emergency Management Branch (SEMB) provides and coordinates whole of government strategic policy and program advice to strengthen ACT public safety and better position the ACT to prevent, plan, respond and recover from security and emergency risks and incidents. With a focus on public safety and whole- of-government coordination and collaboration, the SEMB's key portfolio responsibilities include: Supporting the Government and Ministers in relation to national and local security and emergency management policy matters Supporting the effective and efficient operation of the ACT's strategic security and emergency management committees including the Security and Emergency Management Cabinet (SEMC), Security and Emergency Management Senior Officials Group (SEMSOG), Countering Violent Extremism Steering Committee (CVE -SC) and the Security and Emergency Management Policy Group (SEMPG) Supporting ACT officials a t peak security and emergency management policy bodies including the Australia- New Zealand Counter -Terrorism Committee (ANZCTC) and the Australia -New Zealand Emergency Management Committee (ANZEMC) Supporting SEMSOG to deliver their statutory responsibilities during times of emergency in the ACT Contributing to the national develop of policies and programs through representation on a high number of national committees and working groups Enhancing and maintaining the ACT's Public Safety CCTV Network to enabl e ACT Policing to better investigate crime and the ACT Government to deliver safe and well managed events Implementing the National Living Safe Together Program to counter violent extremism Enhancing the ACT's critical infrastructure. Structure The SEMB includes 10 staff. The Branch Head of SEMB is the Senior Director who reports to the Deputy Director-General, Community Safety. 2017-18 saw a temporary change in the Branch Head that provided the opportunity for additional recruitment into the branch and a r eassessment of priorities. The Senior Director contributes to the development of national security and emergency management policy through membership of the Critical Infrastructure Advisory Council, National Countering Violent Extremism Sub-Committee and the Transport Security Committee. The Senior Director is also the Senior Advisor to the ACT Government member on ANZCTC. The Senior Director is also a member of SEMSOG, and chairs SEMPG and the ACT's CCTV Working Group. Key Achievements The SEMB has progressed a wide range of policy initiatives and programs in the key areas of public safety, security, risk identification and disaster resilience, legislative reform, critical infrastructure and emergency preparedness. Key achievements for this reporting period include: providing briefings for Senior Officials and the Chief Minister who attended the special counter - terrorism meeting of the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in October 2017 Justice and Community Safety Directorate 160 Annual Report 2017 -2018 working in close partnership with ACT Policing and ACT Government crowded place owners and operators, developed a plan that saw the successful implementation of Australia's Strategy for Protecting Crowded Places from Terrorism implementing reforms to the work of SEMSOG and SEMPG including the establishment SEMSOG Strategic Activities and a Risk Register to strengthen future direction and risk management contributing to the Australian Government review of PartIII AAA of the Defence Act 1903 to enable a more streamlined approach to the use of the Australian Defence Forces by states and territories contributing to the National effort to establish a Public Safety Mobile Broadband (PSMB) capability Contributing to the Australian Government preparation of the Security of Critical Infrastructur e Act 2018 to better protect Australia's critical infrastructure. contributing to the reforms by the Australian Government of Australia's Natural Disaster Funding Arrangements, and progressed the preparation of three ACT claims, one of which has been paid and closed commencing a trial of solar powered CCTV to better support the ACT Government's needs for CCTV where the requirement is temporary, or no infrastructure is available reviewing and updating the ACT Territory Wide Risk Assessment to provide a strategic understand of the natural hazard risks faced by the ACT completing a community engagement project in relation to counter violent extremism to better understand ways the ACT Government could continue to build a community that is socially cohesive, safe and aware hosting the 2018 National Transport Security Committee establishing a Protective Security Portfolio Intranet site that provides access to information on the Protective Security Policy Framework and supporting documentation to all ACT Public Servants delivering an enhanced program of travel security and threat assessment briefings to stakeholders across the ACT Government , and managing the extension to the National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience that saw a combined ACT Government -Australian Government investment in 13 additional projects in the ACT that builds natural disaster resilience. National and ACT Committee Engagement and Participation A significant responsibility of SEMB is to brief and support ACT Government officials who represent the ACT at a wide range of national security and emergency management committees. In 2017 -18, SEMB briefed and supported ACT Ministers and Government offici als who attended the following key national meetings: the special counter- terrorism meet ing of COAG four ANZCTC meetings three ANZEMC meetings, and two Critical Infrastructure Advisory Council Meetings. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 161 Annual Report 2017 -2018 In addition, SEMB prepares meeting papers and provides secretariat support to several security and emergency management committees. In 2017 -18, SEMB briefed and supported ACT Government officials who attended the following meetings in 2018- 19: three SEMC meetings four SEMSOG meetings four SEMPG meetings, a nd three Countering Violent Extremism Steering Committee meetings. Public Safety Closed Circuit Television SEMB is responsible for the management and enhancement of the ACT's P ublic Saf ety CCTV Network (the Network). The Network consists of an interconnection of ACT Government owned CCTV systems located at public venues and open spaces including the Canberra City, GIO Stadium, Manuka Oval, EPIC, Kingston and Manuka Shopping Precincts and the Jolimont Bus Station. Live and recorded footage is available for the system to ACT Police to support crime reduction and investigation, and the ACT Government to support safe and well managed events. 2017 -18 saw the completion of the program funded in 2016 -17 to upgrade the Network. These upgrades included the upgrade of analogue CCTV cameras to high-definition digital, the installation of a new model for CCTV network video recorders that improves efficiency and reduces duplication. This project has seen an enhancement of ACT Policing to investigate crime through the availability of greater coverage and higher quality CCTV images. The SEMB commenced a trial of using solar powered CCTV units to provide a CCTV capability where the CCTV need is only temporary of no fixated infrastructure is available. Solar powered CCTV units have been installed at the National Arboretum Canberra to enhance the security of car parking locations, and units were installed on a temporary basis at Floriade and Christmas in Gleb e Park to enhance crowded place safety and the situational awareness of event manager. Implementing of Australia's Strategy for Protecting Crowded Places from Terrorism SEMB lead the implementation for ACT Government of Australia's Strategy for Protecting Crowded Places from Terrorism (the 'Strategy') that was launched by the Prime Minister in August 2017. The implementation has involved working closely with ACT Policing and ACT Government directorates to use the tools in the strategy to assess the ACT crowded places and determine what physical security measures may be required. SEMB develop the ACT Government Crowded Place Implementation Plan to provide a whole -of-government approach to the implementation of the Strategy. Territory Wide Risk Assessment 2017 The Territory Wide Risk Assessment (TWRA) 2017 is the ACT's strategic level analysis of the natural hazards and other emergency risks facing the ACT. The TWRA 2017 builds on the previous TWRA, this time placing a greater emphasis on understanding how emergencies may impact the community. SEMB led the development and publication of the TWRA in 2017-18 which was endorsed by SEMSOG. The TWRA 2017 is publicly available at http://esa.act.gov.au/community- information/publications/ Justice and Community Safety Directorate 162 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ACT Drill Style Exercise Program The SEMB administers and coordinates funding allocated to the ACT under the ANZCTC's drill style exercise fund. Funding received by the ACT for 2017-18 supported a wide range of single and multi- agency/directorate drills and training exercises that practice counter- terrorism capabilities. These drills and exercises included practicing and developing th e ACT's decontamination and urban search and rescue capabilities, practicing mass casualty incident preparedness and response, practicing the ACT's evacuation and recovery centre activation and establishment procedures, as well as exercising and enhancing the ACT's major event management and crowded place public safety capabilities. Critical Infrastructure Resilience Arrangements In 2017 -18 the SEMB strengthened the ACT's understanding of critical infrastructure by completing the Critical Infrastructure Arrangements (CIRA) project. The CIRA project has reviewed and updated of all critical infrastructure information held by the ACT, including the mapping of interdependencies. The SEMB also contributed to the development of the Security of Critical Infrastruct ure Act 2018 by the Australian Government. Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) The SEMB is responsible for the development and delivery of policies and programs in the ACT that promote social cohesion and counter violent extremism. This work is coordinated by SEMB through the ACT CVE -SC. In the 2017 -18, SEMB was an active participant in several National committees and working groups that progress CVE policy in relation to fixated threat, mental health, returning foreign fighters and prisoners. CVE training to over 25 internal and external stakeholders to educate and inform their approach to emerging trends and issues in CVE. To better understand the requirement for CVE awareness raising, the SEMB applied for and received $45,000 in Commonwealth to progress a CVE community engagement project. This project resulted in the consultation with more than 60 stakeholders across the ACT Government, community service providers, State, Territory, and Commonwealth Governments and CVE r esearchers on the most appropriate and effective means to educate and raise CVE awareness in the ACT. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 163 Annual Report 2017 -2018 B.2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - STRATEGIC INDICATORS AND OBJECTIVES Strategic Objective 1 - Accessible Justice System Strategic Indicator 1: Justice System Completion Rates The ACT justice system seeks to ensure fairness to all persons involved. A fair justice system is accessible, deals with matters in a reasonably expeditious manner and is one in which all persons involved conduct themselves in a way that prom otes, protects and respects rights. Table 40 Justice system completion rates Success Strategic Indicator 2013 - 14 Result 2014 - 15 Result 2015 -16 Result 2016 -17 Result 2017 -18 Result Timely completion of civil cases in the courts Medi an number of days to finalise civil cases from time of lodgement Magistrates Court 13 N/A 47 32 43 36 Supreme Court 14 N/A 365 365 291 308 Coroners Court N/A 83 75 95 92 Timely completion of criminal cases in the courts Median number of days to finali se criminal cases from time of lodgement Magistrates Court N/A 85 81 91 70 Supreme Court 15 N/A 211 285 266 254 Timely completion of ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT) cases Median number of days to finalise ACAT cas es from time of lodgement 16 N/A 49 57 48 63 13 The target for 'median number of days to finalise civil cases from time of lodgement in the ACT Magistrates Court' was 50 days and the result was 36 days. This is a positive result and was due to the increased use of mediation and more rigorous case management to resolve matters earlier. These figures exclude Children and Coroners Court matters from calculating the median. 14 The target for 'median number of days to finalise civil cases from time of lodgement in the ACT Supreme Court' was 365 days and the result was 308 days. This is a positive result and was du e to the earlier disposition of matters as a result of referral of all cases to mediation, greater case management and the introduction of central civil listing. 15 The target for 'median number of days to finalise criminal cases from time of lodgement in t he Supreme Court' was 200 days and the result was 254 days. The outcome exceeds the target due to the Supreme Court focussing on the finalisation of older criminal matters. 16 The target for 'median days to finalise ACAT cases from time of lodg ement' was 50 days and the result was 63 days. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 164 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Strategic Objective 2 - Safe Community Strategic Indicator 2: Crime Related Community Safety An effective criminal justice system underpins the safety of the community. Although neither the directorate or the AC T Government can control all of the factors that impact on community safety, effectiveness can be measured by examining the level of crime against people and property and whether the justice system deals with offenders in a way that reduces the risk of further offending. Table 41 Crime related community safety Success Strategic Indicator 2013 - 14 Result 2014 - 15 Result 2015 - 16 Result 2016 - 17 Result 2017 - 18 Result Reduction in level of crime Percentage change17and number of known and re ported criminal offences: people who felt 'safe' or 'very safe': at home by themselves during the night Refer to A 92.7% 92.6% 90.6% 92.6% walking by themselves in their neighbourhood during the night Refer to B 58.4% 57.1% 56.1% 59.1% by themselves travelling on public transport during the night Refer to B 32.9% 31.9% 32.4% 40.0% Escapes/ abscondments from custody Number of or abscondments per 100 detainees 0 0 0.25 0.4520 0 17 Change refers to the change from the previous financial year. 18 The increase in offences against the person can be attributed in part to the current focus on family and domestic violence and the increased confidence people have in reporting family and domestic violence incidents to police. 19 Perceptions of safety indicators are drawn from the National Survey of Community Satisfaction with Policing, a selfreporting survey conducted by the Social Research Centre. The sample size and landline based methodology may limit how representative the results are of the ACT population as a whole. 20 In September 2017, two detainees escaped from the Alexander Maconochie Centre. The result is based on the yearly daily avera ge number of detainees in secure custody.

Strategic Objective 5 - Promotion and Protection of Rights and Interests Strategic Indicator 5: Awareness and Compliance with Human Rights and Interests The ACT Human Rights Commission, now including the Public Advocate of the ACT and Victim Support ACT, protects the rights of vulnerable members of the community. The Commission provides community engagement, information, support and/or advice in relation to the roles and functions of their Commissioners, including how members of the community can access and protect their rights. Additionally, as required under the Human Rights Act 2004 , the directorate seeks to ensure that all legislation is compatible with human rights.

Under its contract with the Commission it was required to distribute 500 information brochures on victims' rights. The results prior to 2016-17 reflect that contractual requirement. In September 2016 the Commission assumed management of the VS ACT Volunteer Program. The 2016-17 result reflects the change. The Commission conducts a range of activities to raise awareness of victims' rights and these will be captured as a measure in future reports. 23 The higher than target 2017-18 est imated outcome in relation to the number of community members made aware of their rights in the area of responsibility for victim support is attributed to a change in how the strategic indicator is measured.

The directorate will generally not accept High and Extreme risk levels; however, circumstances may mean that some High and Extreme risks are necessarily accepted by the Director-General and the Senior Management Committee (SMC) due to no practical treatment option being available to avoid, transfer or reduce the risk to a lower level and the opportunities, benefits or situation sufficiently outweighs and justifies the risk The directorate is currently reviewing its Risk Management Plan in line with the ACT Insurance Authority's (ACTIA) review of the Whole of Government Risk Management Framework. JACS' current Risk Management Plan provides the necessary foundations and guidance on risk management processes throughout the directorate and ensures a consistent, efficient and effective approach to identifying and managing risk. Our risk management processes currently comply with AS/ NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk Management \u2014Principles and Guidelines and will be updated during 2018- 19 to comply with ISO 31000:2018 - Risk Management Standard. Risk Management Statement Risk management in the directorate supports the ACT Government's commitment to 'managing risk to meet its fiscal, social and environmental responsibilities'. Risk is inherent in all directorate functions; the elimination or avoidance of all risk is not practical or appropriate. A strategic systematic approach to ris k management, aligned with organisational objectives and strategies, will enable sound judgements and decision making and cost effective use of resources and will maximise potential opportunities while minimising adverse consequences. Sound risk management principles are integrated into all aspects of the directorate's work to identify and mitigate risks, while fostering a culture of innovation, continuous improvement and high performance. The key objectives of the directorate's risk management framework ar e: > consistent, confident and accountable planning and decision making > identifying and taking opportunities to improve performance but also avoiding or reducing the risk of something going wrong > anticipating future risks and recognising external facto rs that may impact the organisation > effective allocation of resources > sound stakeholder confidence and trust > compliance with relevant legislation and governance requirements > an appropriate balance between the cost of managing risk and the anticipat ed benefits , and Justice and Community Safety Directorate 185 Annual Report 2017 -2018 > a clear understanding by all staff of their roles, responsibilities and authorities for managing risk. The directorate will generally not accept High or Extreme risk levels. However, circumstances may mean that some High and Extreme risks are necessarily accepted by the Director-General and the Strategic Management Committee due to no practical treatment option being available to avoid, transfer or reduce the risk to a lower level and the opportunities, benefits or situation sufficiently outweighs and justifies the risk. Having noted that overall position, it is inappropriate to: > threaten the health and safety of the directorate's staff, customers or stakeholders > breach the directorate's legislative obligations, including the ACT Publi c Sector Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics > damage the interests or reputation of the ACT Government or the directorate > damage the directorate's credibility with the government, the Legislative Assembly, the ACT community or other key stakeholders > incur a significant financial loss or other liability to the ACT Government or the directorate, and > accept any form of fraud or integrity breach. All risks are to be treated, monitored and escalated in accordance with the directorate's Risk Management Plan and managed to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. Risk Registers The directorate has and business unit risk registers which itemise risks at the strategic, business and operational levels, and also identify the directorate's fraud risk exposure. The risk registers are reviewed and refined regularly. The process for identifying risks has matured considerably over the past few years, with greater understanding being developed by the directorate in the value of risk management to the organisation. During 2017 -18, JACS formally reported on strategic risk to the SMC. The strategic and business unit risk registers are also presented to the Audit and Performance Committee (APIC) on a regular basis. Both APIC and SMC identify action items to be undertaken to enhance the risk management program. This is a process of continuous improvement and maturity of risk management capability. The APIC Chair reports to the Director-General on the directorate's governance, risk and internal control environment after each APIC meeting. Business unit heads are routinely required to present to APIC on the identification of risk, as well as the way in which risks are controlled by the business unit in practice. Risk Awareness and Training Further investment has been made by the directorate in supporting staff to attend relevant ACTIA risk management training programs which are aimed at assisting teams to develop and continue to refine their risk registers. During the 2017-18 financial year, three directorate staff at tended Introduction to Risk Management training provided by ACTIA, and workshops were held with a further 33 staff and executives to undertake environmental scans and validate the effectiveness of the controls and treatments included in a range of risk registers. In 2018-19, the directorate will continue to engage with ACTIA to further develop the directorate's risk maturity. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 186 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Additionally in 2017 -18, 93 directorate staff attended five project management and governance training courses, each of which included a risk management and awareness component.

Internal audits and reviews may cover any of the programs and activities of the directorate, together with associated entities as provided for in relevant business agreements, Memoranda of Understanding or contracts, and may be conducted by the directorate's Internal Audit staff or by an external contractor. The directorate's responsibility under the Financial Management Act 1996 includes the maintenance of an APIC to consider governance structures as outlined in the ACT Government's Internal Audit Framework . Audit Performance and Improvement Committee The Audit and Performance Improvement Committee (APIC) is a key part of the governance arrangements of the directorate, with particular emphasis being placed on better practices, continuous improvement, internal control mechanisms, risk management strategies, internal audit and ethical behaviour and integrity. The APIC does not replace or duplicate any established management responsibilities, accountabilities or delegations and, through the Chair, provides independent advice and reports directly to the Director-General. The APIC Charter was reviewed during 2017-18, resulting in a new Terms of Reference being established in its place for implementation during 2018- 19. The APIC oversees the development and implementation of the three-year strategic internal audit plan and the 12-month audit work plan. Both plans use a risk-based methodology to id entify areas of strategic and operational risk. As part of the annual audit program, ten audits and reviews were presented to APIC for consideration in 2017 -18: JACS Assurance Map Procurement Audit AMC Detainee Trust Account Fraud Risk Assessment Review of Security of Ambulance Medication Kits HP Records Manager 8 Access Controls Review Warrant Procedural Review Accountability Indicators Review Justice and Community Safety Directorate 188 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Statement of Performance Recommendations Review Human Rights Commission, Public Trustee and Guardian and 12 Moore Street Business Continuity Tests, and Bushfire Preparedness Risk Assessment. Field work was in progress for a further two audits, both of which are expected to be presented to APIC in September 2018. These audits are as follows: ACT Courts and Tribunal Tra vel Entitlements , and Security and Emergency Management Branch Grant Management.

The plan provides the framework for raising awareness of, and reducing and managing instances of fraud and corruption in the directorate. The directorate maintains a SharePoint register which captures fraud risks at the strategic, business, and operational level, which is reported to the APIC on a regular basis. Fraud Awareness Training The directorate continues to increase staff awareness in relation to ethics, integrity, and fraud and corruption prevention through staff training and development. Fraud and ethics training is mandatory for all directorate staff. In 2017 -18, the directorate conducted five programmed sessions, which suppo rted the attendance of 71 staff.

The directorate also continued to contribute to the ACT Women's Action Plan focusing on ways to increase female representation at all levels in the organisation. This work is driven by the directorate's workforce Executive Champion for Women, ESA Commissioner, Dominic Lane. The directorate celebrated 2018 International Women's Day with a range of events including: A presentation by Sally Moyle (CEO of Care Australia) and Nipuni Wijewickrama (Co -founder of social enterprise GGs Flowers) providing an international and ACT perspective on 'Leave no Woman Behind' Brigadier Natasha Fox (Australian Defence Force) spoke to ESA staff on the topic 'blazing a trail to the top in the military', and ACTCS staff participation in a morning tea provided by the male staff of 2CA. We continue to develop our women who participated in a range of leadership programs including: ANZSOG Executive Master of Public Administration IPAA Future Leaders Program IPAA Mentoring Program Public Sector Management Program Women in Leadership Summit Justice and Community Safety Directorate 201 Annual Report 2017 -2018 YWCA She Leads Diploma of Leadership and Management, and Australian Institute of Policy Management - Balance: Women Leaders in Public Safety Program. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) To continue to ensure that the directorate mirrors the community we serve, and also to create safe places for an inclusive working environment, in 2017-18 the directorate undertook the Aids Action Council and the A Gender Agenda education and training on LGBTIQ awareness and inclusivity. The basic training program covered a wide range of topics and encouraged individuals to contemplate their own level of awareness and workplace inclusiveness. The directorate will continue to explore further developmental opportunities through our Inclusion Statement 2016 -2019 and further work with the current workforce Executive Champion, Commissioner for Disability, Health and Community Services, Karen Toohey. Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) Staff As at 27 June 2018, the directorate had 170 employees (9.1% of the workforce) who identify as being from a culturally and linguistically diverse background. As part of valuing workplace diversity and inclusion the directorate provides ongoing contribution to the ACT Multicultural Framework 2015- 2020. This framework provides a clear focus to work with the CALD community and provides avenues for employment and career development. The directorate participates in the whole of government Work Experience and Support Program (WESP). The directorate continues to celebrate days of cultural significance. Of particular note was the 2018 Harmony Day celebrations. These included: Tensin Phuntosho, a Canberra -based film maker from Bhutun, screened his film A Yak Herder's Son, which provided insights into Bhutanese culture. This event was comb ined with a multicultural lunch, and ACTCS conducted a Harmony Day luncheon with money raised ($211.85) donated to the Canberra Refugee Support. Chief Operating Officer Moira Crowhurst is the directorate's appointed Executive Champion for the CALD workforce. Ageing The directorate has a diverse workforce with 44% of our workforce over the age of 45 and 17% over the age of 55. This rep resents a significant workforce challenge to manage across a range of issues including succession planning, knowledge transfer, transition to retirement and supporting employees through their career. The Executive Champion for this section of our workforce is ACT Government Solicitor General Manager Lana Junakovic.

The directorate has developed policies and programs to promote ecologically ESD considerations in decision-making processes, as required by the Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act 2010 and the Environment Protection Act 1997. The directorate: participates in the ACT Government's carbon neutral implementation committee and reports on sustainable initiatives developed a sustainabilit y management plan (SMP) 2018 -20 which identifies objectives, improvement targets and sustainability initiatives, and has a Sustainability Manager within the corporate division to provide guidance, leadership and coordination to the directorate to achieve identified environmental targets. The directorate's SMP 2018-20 is aligned to the ACT carbon neutral government (CNG) framework, and provides a roadmap for JACS to transition to zero greenhouse emissions. The SMP seeks to: drive value for money energy supply and water upgrades with a return on investment over the life of the infrastructure at high usage and emitting sites embed sustainability principles into all aspects of our business, including new build/expansion of sites harness the CNG fund to deliver energy efficiency opportunities commence coordinated planning for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure , and accredit sites under the ACT Government's Actsmart waste recycling program. The directorate will continue to undertake a range of energy efficiency works to implement ESD measures across the property p ortfolio of the directorate through: targeted energy audits to understand energy usage and to inform potential opportunities and energy efficiency projects upgrades to building management systems, heating ventilation and air conditioning systems, and power factor correction at high energy use sites installation and expansion of solar panels and solar hot water systems at selected sites, and incorporate sustainable solutions for all new facilities. Sustainability initiatives that have been taken to improve ESD outcomes are as follows: Energy monitoring of energy performance of our facilities using the enterprise sustainability platform (ESP) dedicated funding for energy efficiency works through the better infrastructure fund (BIF) appropriated annually and di stributed across selected sites within the property portfolio of the directorate Justice and Community Safety Directorate 209 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Gungahlin, Joint Emergency Services Centre (JESC) installation of light -emitting diode (LED) lighting, upgrade of the building management system, improved lighting controls, i nstallat ion of light sensing technology ACTESA Training Centre heating and ventilation improvements and building management system upgrade, and ACTRFS Jerrabomberra external lighting upgrade.

It is based on actual historical data and is a retrospective adjustment of the original 0.525 factor used for 2016 - 17 annual reporting. A factor of 0.455 kilogram (kg) CO2 -e CO2 -e / megawatt hour (MWh) has been used to calculate electricity emissions for the 2017-18 period 30 The directorate has conducted a rationalisation of the existing waste arrangements. This has led to a reduction in the number of bins, bin sizes and frequen cy of bin pick-ups for all required waste services (waste to landfill, paper and cardboard, secure destruction and co-mingled waste). This rationalisation has led to a significant decrease in both waste to land fill, paper and cardboard and an increase in co-mingled waste. 31 Co-mingled waste reported at AMC includes both co-mingled (mixed plastics, glass / cartons and metals) and paper/cardboard recycled material. A co-mingled recycling compactor is used on site at AMC. Shredded paper is put into a worm farm for organic material recycling. 32 The directorate has conducted a rationalisation of the existing waste arrangements.

deliver successful capital works outcomes during 2017- 18 which has strengthened its ability to support the provision of services to the ACT community. The directorate's Capital Works and Infrastructure Branch amalgamated with the directorate's ICT Programs and Project Delivery Branch in late 2017. This amalgamation has combined the planning, procurement, contract and project management expertise and enhanced project delivery capacity within the directorate. To further strengthen project delivery, capability and ca pacity, The directorate embedded a project manager with ACT Policing (ACTP). This officer will work in conjunction with ACTP to manage and deliver better infrastructure fund (BIF) works and capital project initiatives. The directorate has worked in conjunction with Infrastructure, Finance and Capital Works (IFCW) of the Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD) to complete a number of capital upgrades to directorate-owned facilities. Works were undertaken for various agencies including ACTP, ACT Emergency Services Agency (ESA), ACT Corrective Services (ACTCS) and the ACT Courts and Tribunal (ACTCT). Works included but were not limited to: delivery of a new Stat e Emergency Service unit in Tuggeranong (Calwell) continuation of the New Courts Facilities Project continuation and completion of the privacy and dignity project at Fyshwick Fire and Rescue Station , and delivery of the privacy and dignity project at Guises Creek Rural Fire Service Facility. Case Study: New Tuggeranong State Emergency Service unit in Calwell The ESA unveiled its first new purpose-built ACT State Emergency Service (ACTSES) unit in more than four decades when the Tuggeranong unit in Calwell i n March 2018. The state of the art Tuggeranong unit, built under the ESA's station upgrade and relocation program (SURP), satisfies the need for a modern, fit for purpose building for SES operations and volunteers in southern Canberra. It is the first purpose-built facility for the ACTSES since the current Woden SES unit in Phillip was built in 1975. The unit was constructed as part of the ESA's SURP strategy to optimise the ACT's emergency response facilities for the protection of the ACT community now and into the future. More than $2.5 million was allocated over two year in the ACT's 2016 -17 Budget to construct the fit for purpose facility, which will not only help retain volunteers but also attract new ones and provide an important community service to s outhern Canberra. The Tuggeranong unit has many design features to make it more environmentally sustainable including hydronic in-slab heating and cooling, rainwater tanks, solar electricity and hot water and community meeting rooms that can be booked and used by approved groups free of charge. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 320 Annual Report 2017 -2018 In keeping with the ESA's commitment to building emergency facilities in strategic locations, the Tuggeranong unit is on Johnson Drive which will help reduce response times due to its location on a main arterial road. SURP strives to improve the positioning of new stations and upgrading existing facilities to more efficiently and effectively respond to the current and future needs of the community. This is achieved through detailed studies focusing on the ideal placement of emergency service facilities. These studies identify where emergency services should be located to provide optimum coverage to the ACT community well into the future. Figure 51 Figure New Tuggeranong State Emergency Service Unit ACTSES Tuggeranong Improved functionality and design for new stations, like the Tuggeranong unit, will help to maximise the efficiency of emergency services operations and their ability to respond to the growing and changing needs of the Canberra co mmunity. Case Study: New Courts Facilities In December 2015, the Territory entered into an agreement with Juris Partnership, comprising Laing O'Rourke, Macquarie Capital and their partners, to deliver a new $165 million justice precinct for the Australian Capital Territory. The new courts facilities project in the centre of Canberra is the Territory's first public -private partnership. The project will create a combined law courts facility for the ACT which will maximise operational efficiencies while still respecting the jurisdictional separation between the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court. The new Supreme Court will be located within a four storey building constructed along Vernon Circle and will also occupy parts of the existing Supreme Court building following its reconfiguration. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 321 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Work commenced on the new building in 2016 and stage one works are due for completion in September 2018. The second stage works, the refurbishment of the existing Supreme Court, are forecast for completion in 2019.

The directorate has worked closely with CMTEDD to develop a procurement training program for staff at all levels. These programs are aimed to raise staff awareness and to assis t staff in making empowered and informed decisions whilst conducting procurement activities on behalf of the Territory. The directorate has developed a procurement, contract management and assurance framework. This framework assists with instructing directorate staff regarding the various pieces of legislation covering procurement, contract management and assurance measures and also includes the directorate's internal procurement policies and procedures. This framework is a living document and is regularly checked and updated to ensure that the information contained within is update and consistent with overall government policy. During the 2017 -18 financial year, the directorate procurement activities were focused on delivering strategic objectives of the di rectorate particularly in the delivery of capital works and other services. The directorate continues to ensure that prior to the engagement of all building contractors, contractors hold a current industrial relations and employment (IRE) certificate compliant with the ACT Government's compliance with industrial relations and employment strategy. Social Procurement As an advocate of the Government's commitment to social procurement, the directorate facilitated and implemented several community based services and initiatives during this financial year period.

VICTIMS OF CRIME Introduction The Annual Reports (Government Agencies) Notice 2017 requires reporting on the following: the number of applications made during the financial year particulars of awards of financial assistance made in respect of those applications brief descriptions of the facts and circumstances of each award made during the financial year any other particulars relating to the operation of the Act considered appropriate. In previous years reporting has provided information to be gathered regarding occupation of the victims. The directorate does not consider this is relevant information to the operation of the scheme and has concerns that in some circumstances may lead to the identification of victims. The directorate has therefore, determined not to report this information. Explanation as to the operation of the Act for 2017- 18 Establishment of the Scheme The scheme was established by the Act, which commenced on 24 December 1999. The Act vests jurisdiction in the ACT Magistrates Court for all matters commenced after that date. Prior to this date, the ACT Supreme Court and the ACT Magistrates Court exercised jurisdiction of criminal injury matters under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1983 . The scheme has now been replaced by the Victims of Crime (Financial Assistance) Act 2016 which commenced on 1 July 2016. The ACT Magistrates Court continues to have jurisdiction to determine matters where an incident occurred prior to 1 July 2016 and an a pplication was made on or before 30 June 2017. Matters that commenced in the court prior to 30 June 2017 remain within the jurisdiction of the court. Where a compensable incident occurred from 1 July 2016 the matter will be determined by the Victims of Crime Commissioner. Determination of Applications The procedure for the determination of applications from a victim of crime requires that each matter be listed before a Deputy Registrar for a conference prior to a hearing. The purpose of the conference is to assess whether the matter is ready to proceed to determination. Most applications are resolved by the Territory providing an assessment to the applicant and the Court making an award in accordance with an agreement reached between the parties. The types o f matters that were determined during the reporting year are identified in a below table. Recovery of Financial Assistance Provisional orders for restitution can only be made by the Court upon application by the Territory. The Registrar received 26 applications in the reporting year, all of which resulted in provisional Justice and Community Safety Directorate 361 Annual Report 2017 -2018 orders for restitution being made by the Court. One was confirmed during the reporting year from a previous financial year.

The SBMP is the overarching strategic document that directs all levels of bushfire planning for the ACT. ACT Strategic Bushfire Management Plan The SBMP (Version 3) was tabled in the ACT Legislative Assembly as a Disallowable Instrument on 23 September 2014 and is valid to September 2019. The first SBMP was developed for 2004 - 2009 (Version 1) and second 2009 - 2014 (Version 2). The SBMP has reinforced continuous improvement in bushfire management outcomes in the ACT. The Bushfire Council plays an important role in the SBMP and must be consulted by the ESA Commissioner to monitor the scope and effectiveness of the plan as per Section 72(7) of the Emergencies Act 2004. The SBMP contains strategies and actions that: recognise the value of our volunteers in the ESA promote awareness in the community about the risk posed from bushfire outline responsibilities on land owners and managers to prevent bushfires implement bushfire prevention and preparedness activities reduce bushfire ignitions support our firefighters to respond to bushfires rapidly, and ensure that our activities are holistic and supported by contemporary research, urban planning and design, community engagement and community resilience. Bushfire Council The Bushfire Council is an advisory body established by the Emergencies Act 2004 . Section 130 of the Act sets out the functions of the Bushfire Council which are to advise the Minister for Police and Emergency Services about matters relating to bushfires and advise the Emergency Services Commissioner when requested. The Bushfire Council provides advice and an Annual Preparedness Report to the Minist er on matters relating to bushfire management in the ACT in the areas of prevention, preparedness, response and recovery. In 2017 -18, the Bushfire Council held monthly meetings. The ACTRFS and ACT Parks and Conservation Service (PCS) hosted a field trip for members of the Bushfire Council and the Justice and Community Safety Director -General as the Chair of the Security and Emergency Management Senior Officials Group (SEMSOG). The purpose of t his field trip was to show participants the scope and scale of suburban development, bushfire protective measures requirements for community safety, and best practice vegetation management of Asset Protection Zones (APZs). Justice and Community Safety Directorate 369 Annual Report 2017 -2018 At the Parkwood site, participants viewed the scale of the Ginninderry development, proposed Murrumbidgee River Corridor reserves/APZs, the location for the high voltage switch yard and additional residential development proposals to the South within the existing rural land. Discussions were held regarding APZs along the Western urban interface, which contains one of the few areas within the ACT where urban development will adjoin forest vegetation. Strategic Bushfire Management Plan Project Board The SBMP Project Board is the principal forum for monitoring progress of the 71 actions in the SBMP. It is set up to support the 12 objectives of the SBMP, which is a requirement of the Emergencies Act 2004. It is chaired by the Chief Officer, ACT Rural Fire Service and includes senior representation from all ACT Government agencies with responsibilities under the SBMP. The following provides a summary regarding the implementation of a number of key action items progressed throughout 2017 -18 by ACT Government directorates. Bushfire Operational Plans Section 77 of the Emergencies Act 2004 requires an owner of land or manager of unleased Territory land or land occupied by the Territory to, as far as practicable, ensure the land is managed in accordance with the SBMP and comply with any bushfire management requirements. Section 78 of the Emergencies Act 2004 requires a manager of an area of unleased Territory land or land occupied by the Territory to prepare a Bushfire Operational Plan (BOP) in accordance with the SBMP. The Act also specifically outlines the requirement for ACT Government directorates and other prescribed entities to develop a BOP for Bushfire Prone Area (BPA) every two years. The ESA Commissioner approves all BOPs. BOPs need to outline preventi on and preparedness activities along with the performance indicators and reporting applicable for these activities. A BOP also details the specific timing, type and location of fuel-reduction, access and infrastructure activities that are proposed over the life of the BOP. The SBMP also provides a series of bushfire management standards, which must be met in relation to vegetation management. The standards are available on the ESA website at: http://cdn.esa.act.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/Fire-Managment-Standards- ACT-SBMPv31.pdf . Rural leaseholders within the Bushfire Abatement Zone (BAZ) are required under Section 78 of the Emergencies Act 2004 to provide a draft bushfire operational plan. Participation in the ACT Farm FireWise program, which is implemented by RFS staff working closely with landholders, satisfies this requirement. Auditing of Bushfire Operational Plans ACTRFS audits directorate and utility BOPs. The audit process is an opportunity to monitor progress, identify opportunities for improvement and priorities for future BOPs. The audits verify that directorates and utilities are conducting the BOP activities approved by the ESA Commissioner. Aud it results are summarised and provided to the Chief Officer ACTRFS, the ESA Commissioner and the Bushfire Council. Performance results are reported against the accountability indicator 'Desktop audit of ACT Government Directorate Bushfire Operational Plans activity progress reports' within section C.6 'Statements of Performance'. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 370 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Field audits of hazard reduction burning activities and access upgrades to the strategic access network are conducted to ensure that these activities are being completed as scheduled, and in accordance with the standards of the SBMP. No significant anomalies were found during 2017- 18. Where slight discrepancies in activity counts have been identified, they have been attributed to counting or report extraction errors. Anomalies such as these are investigated, discussed with auditors, and noted on audit reports. ACTRFS personnel undertake these audits which are also used to contribute to ongoing and future mitigation planning such as the Regional Fire Management Plans. In compliance wi th section 78 of the Act, the ESA Commissioner receives and approve BOPs from ACT Government directorates and other entities. The following agencies or entities are required to have an approved bushfire operational plan: Table 82 Approved Bushfire Operational Plans Directorate BOPs Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD) Stromlo Forest Park National Arboretum Strathnairn Arts ACT Pr operty Group rural leases Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate (EPSDD).

ACT Government Directorates' Bushfire Operational Plans Schedule 2 of the SBMP specifically outlines the requirement for ACT Government directorates and other prescribed entities to develop a BOP for properties within Bushfire Prone Areas (BPAs) on an annual basis. The BOPs for ACT Government directorates and other prescribed entities are detailed in the following section: Justice and Community Safety Directorate 371 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate The CMTEDD has the following locations - Strathnairn Arts, Stromlo Forest Park and National Arboretum Canberra and ACT Property Group rural leases. During 2017 -18, the CMTEDD reviewed and updated the Bushfire Preparedness Framework providing overarching support and direction for its bushfire activities. BOPs for the above locations were reviewed or approved by the RFS. The functions within the operation plans for Stromlo Forest Park and the National Arboretum Canberra are conducted under their respective BOPs, while artsACT and Strathnairn Arts Association are responsible for BOP functions at Strathnairn Arts. ACT Property Group have a schedule for maintenance and bushfire preparedness activities that are implemented for rural leases. In addition, Strathnairn Arts, Stromlo Forest Park and National Arboretum Canberra have an individual approved Elevated Fire Danger Action Plan. Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate An extensive BOP for the ACT is prepared by EPSDD, which manages the majority of public land in the Territory. EPSDD develops their BOP on an annual basis and these are publicly available on the EPSDD website . ACT Parks and Conservation Servi ce BOP This year, EPSDD's ACT Parks and Conservation Service completed 96.9% of the actions required under the 2017 -18 BOP. The BOP is divided into nine main sections and covers all areas of fire protection including fuel management, access management, inf rastructure, equipment purchase, training, auditing and monitoring, planning and research, education, response and standby. The annual EPSDD BOP is a yearly works program based on the activities identified in the more strategic Regional Fire Management Plans (RFMPs) which are developed by the EPSDD every ten years (with a five year review) and cover the entire ACT. The RFMPs integrate landscape factors including soil type, vegetation, slope, threatened species, cultural issues, water quality and biodiversity into the one plan and program of activities. The implementation of the EPSDD BOP fulfils the legal requirements of the SBMP Version 3and the five year RFMPs. A summary of the activities undertaken in 2017-18 is provided below. Fuel Management Fuel management aims to reduce fire fuel loads to an acceptable level. Actions to achieve this fuel modification include slashing, prescribed burning, grazing, physical removal and chemical treatment of vegetation as detailed in the following: (i) Slashing Strategic areas adjacent to the urban edge and along roadside verges and rural roads are slashed to reduce potential fire intensity and to increase suppression capability. In 2017 -18, the BOP identified 4,705 hectares of slashing across 245 sites, of which 100% was completed. (ii) Prescribed Burning Justice and Community Safety Directorate 372 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The 2017 -18 BOP identified 45 burns, totalling 8259 hectares (ha). A total of 37 burns were completed across an area of 2004 ha. Three of eight uncompleted burns were located in the higher alpine regions of the ACT and constant unfavourable weather conditions prevented their implementation. The other five uncompleted burns included two cultural, two ecological and one urban burns. These burns were not completed due to unfavourable ecological and weather conditions. Any burns that were not completed will be carried over and considered for implementation in the 2018 -19 program. ACT Bushfire Council and the ACT Emergency Services Agency have been updated by email from PCS and through the PCS website every month throughout the autumn period on PCS prescribed burning progress and have been routinely provided with weather and fuel information highlighting the obstacles faced. The last four years has seen over 15,000 hectares of hazard reduction burning delivered across the ACT. Considered together, this treated landscape continues to provide a patchwork of reduced fire fuels on a landscape scale - a key outcome sought by land managers from their fuel reduction program. (iii) Grazing Strategically placed grazing by livestock is an effective method of managing fire fuel loads in many areas across the ACT. The 2017-18 BOP identified 6041 hectares of strategic grazing across 73 sites, of which 100% was achieved. (iv) Physical Removal In certain specific areas, the elimination or reduction of fire fuels through physical removal is undertaken by either hand or machinery. This operation is predominantly undertaken to enable an area to be included for slashing treatments in the future. In 2017 -18, the BOP identified 312 hectares of physical removal across 34 sites, of which 31 jobs are complete totalling 235 hectares. Work is continuing on the three remaining jobs across 77 hectares. (v) Chemical Chemical herbicide is used to treat re-growth in areas that have had previous work (predominantly physical removal) undertaken. In 2017 -18, the BOP identified 372ha of chemical treatment across 33 sites. A total of 214ha was treated with the remaining 158ha across four sites not completed, due to weather conditions, however this work will be rolled ov er to the 2018 -19 BOP. Access Management Access management includes routine road maintenance, vegetation management, upgrading and construction of fire trails and investigating proposed new trails. EPSDD manages more than 4500 kilometres of fire trails which provide for essential rapid access to bushfires and serve as control lines for prescribed burning operations. Actions to achieve this includes the following: (i) Road Maintenance The maintenance of fire trails is undertaken to maintain the accessibility of existing trails for different standards of vehicles. In 2017 -18, the BOP identified 206km of road maintenance across 85 sites of which 84 sites totaling 205km were completed. One job along 1km of trail was not competed but will be placed on the 2018- 19 BOP. (ii) Vegetation Management Justice and Community Safety Directorate 373 Annual Report 2017 -2018 This operation is predominantly mulching or physical removal of roadside vegetation and then application of herbicide to reduce regrowth. It is a crucial part of maintaining a strong open network of fire trails. In 2017- 18, the BOP identified 273km of road side vegetation control across 24 sites, of which all were completed. (iii) Upgra ding of fire trails and water cro ssings The upgrading of fire trails is undertaken to improve the accessibility of existing trails for different standards of vehicles. In 2017-18, the BOP identified 35 kilometres of road construction across four sites. Work is continuing on one job covering just one kilometre and is expected to be completed in 2018 -19. The remaining three jobs covering 34 kilometres are complete. Fire Infrastructure Development Fire infrastructure development includes constructing or developing features or facilities to assist in fire suppression or managing bushfire fuels. A total of 15 projects were identified in the 2017- 18 B OP of which all were completed. Equipment Fire management and fighting equipment purchased in 2017-18 focused on the supply of Fire Personal Protective Equipment and Software maintenance for GIS applications. All eight jobs identified have been completed. Training Ensuring staff have comprehensive and up- to-date training is an essential component of fire management. The training program identified in the BOP is extensive and is aimed at attaining and maintaining competency levels while also building capacity. Training also includes representation at national level meetings and conferences. A total of 62 training activities were listed in the 2017- 18 BOP involving over 4,500 staff hours. A total of 56 activities were completed, four training sessions were unable to be attended by EPSDD staff and two activities were not delivered due to staffing changes and unavailability of course material. Auditing and Monitoring For quality assurance, PCS internal monitoring and auditing against the EPSDD BOP includes specif ic audits on grazing, fire equipment and appliances, fuel hazard assessments, radio communications, fire trails and emergency vehicle access. The 2017 -18 BOP identified 23 audit and monitoring activities, of which 21 were completed. The two tasks not compl eted included a desktop erosion risk modelling and a post burn assessment by the Murumbung Rangers - both to be included in next years' BOP. Planning and Research In the 2017 -18, BOP there were 59 planning and research activities, including acquisition of aerial imagery, Development of Agency wide availability system and the development of concise descriptor guidelines for Incident Action Plans. A total of 53 activities were completed, with the remaining six activities currently underway. These six activities have been carried forward for delivery as part of the 2018-19 BOP and include a road maintenance database and works involving the Murumbung Rangers who require more time to undertake greater community consultation. Education Education activities are designed to keep the public informed about the work undertaken in the BOP. In the 2017 -18 BOP, the target was seven education activities, which included the publication of the 2017 -18 BOP on the EPSDD website, advertising of the prescribed burn program and pr omoting Justice and Community Safety Directorate 374 Annual Report 2017 -2018 positions within the unit to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. All activities were completed. Response and Standby The 2017 -18 Bushfire Season was characterised by a late start and a late finish with a patch of milder weather in the middle. During the 2017-18 Bushfire Season, EPSDD staff undertook fire standby on 48 days, as follows: 41 days of Level 2 (Fire Danger Index 12 to 24) 5 days of Level 3 (Fire Danger Index 25 to 49) 2 days of Level 4 (Fire Danger Index 50 to 74) Seasona l Crew and Plant In 2017 -18, the EPSDD recruited 19 seasonal fire fighters. The seasonal firefighters were utilised in fuel and access management activities, fuel hazard assessments, hazard reduction activities, fire standby and fire suppression. The EPSDD contracted heavy machinery consisting of two bulldozers and one grader for the 2017- 18 bushfire season. These machines assisted with the access works and were fully utilised in fire preparedness and suppression activities. They were also able to implement fire recovery and rehabilitation tasks on several fire grounds across the ACT. Other Achievements Treatment of 87ha of dense pine wildling regrowth at Blue Range in the Lower Cotter Catchment was undertaken to reduce the risk of significant and devastating wildfire in this recovering landscape which is an essential part providing quality water to Canberra. Figure 58 Pine wilding removal Blue Range Pine wilding removal Blue Range PCS trialled spatially-explicit 25m resolution fuel maps of near-surface and elevated fuels derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveying. The products were developed in a partnership with Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre researchers at the Australian National Universi ty. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 375 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 59 Lidar Mapping Lidar Mapping SODAR - stands for Sonic Detection and Ranging and is also known as a vertical wind profiler. One SODAR device was set up at Tidbinbilla in 2016-17 as a joint trial between PCS and Univer sity of NSW (ADFA). This device reports wind direction and strength at various heights above the ground, and is providing useful information on wind conditions in the mountainous areas of the Territory. This device adds to the knowledge on atmospheric conditions on high fire dangers days and during prescribed burning operations. In 2017 -18, a second unit was installed near Gudgenby. This unit is operating entirely on solar power and has benefitted from the lessons learned from the installation of the Tidbinbilla equipment. Both units are expected to operate and enhance bushfire weather information and fire intelligence in 2018 -19.

Justice and Community Safety Directorate 377 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 63 Successful us e of the wet line sprinklers on several prescribed burns. Wet line sprinkler system in use at Black Mountain There have been an upgrade of 15km of Old Boboyan Road in southern Namadgi National Park, improving access for visitors, bushfire suppression, and park management whilst reducing the risk of erosion and ongoing maintenance costs for this road. A major crossing upgrade has been completed within the Lower Cotter Catchment at the junction of Condor Creek and Lees Creek. This is the final construction of a series of three similar crossings. All of the original crossings replaced were constructed in the 1960s as part of the road network for the pine plantation. Figure 64 Old crossing Justice and Community Safety Directorate 378 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Old c rossing Figure 65 New crossing New c rossing PCS senior fire management officers, Brian Levine and Adam Leavesley had papers accepted at the International Association of Wildland Fire conference in Montana, USA. Brian led an interstate team in the development of a new prescribed burn risk management tool, the PB-DST, and his paper described the tool and its use. Adam presented a paper around the development of a new bushfire erosion risk assessment tool based on research conducted through the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre and implemented at PCS. Figure 66 Presentation Adam Leavesley Justice and Community Safety Directorate 379 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 67 Presentation Brian Levine PCS successfully trialed a new readiness arrangement for the 2017- 18 fire season, whereby the ACT was split into four PCS Regions. In addition, three trained Fire Behaviour Analysts (FBANs) were incorporated into the duty roster, allowing for at least one FBAN to assess the forecast weather and fire danger conditions each day during the fire season. This arrangement allowed a finer scale setting of readiness, with greater accuracy and better placement of resources to the areas of greatest potential fire risk across the PCS estate. This increased efficiency and resulted in more e ffective and efficient utilisation of limited resources. Weather Stations - four Portable Automatic Weather Stations (PAWS) and two Remote Area Weather Stations (RAWS) have been purchased and installed by PCS to Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) standards - with 4 weather stations now in semi -permanent positions, feeding weather data to the Bureau of Meteorology METEYE page. This has improved the accessibility and quality of weather information in and around the ACT. Two of the PAWS can be moved as required and have been used for operational purposes, located close to planned prescribed burning for high quality and continuous weather condition information, essential for ensuring conditions for burning are appropriate. Figure 68 Remote Area Weather Station Remote Area Weather Station Justice and Community Safety Directorate 380 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Suburban Land Agency (SLA) BOP The Suburban Land Agency (SLA) Bushfire Operations Plan 2017 -2018 -2019 is prepared by Estate Management SLA. The SLA has 35 activities included in its BOP. The SLA submitted its BOP to ESA for approval and reports quarterly to the ACTRFS. All works identified in the SLA BOP for 2017-18 have been completed. Health Directorate An overarching BOP is currently being developed for all ACT Health sites as required by the Emergencies Act 2004 and is expected to be completed in 2018- 19. The following sites require site specific BOPs: Brian Hennessy House and Arcadia House A BOP has been prepared for ACTRFS review and will be provided to the ESA Commis sioner for approval. ACT Health have taken proactive measures to mitigate the impact of bushfires at the facility and ensure the safety of staff patient and visitors. Dhulwa Mental Health Unit A Bushfire Risk Assessment of this facility was undertaken which identified that a BOP and a site specific FMP were required. Both plans were developed and implemented prior to operation. Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm The Ngunnawal Bush Healing Farm property 'Miowera' has a Bushfire Operational Plan which has been approved by the ESA. The plan will be reviewed and amended annually as required. The following controls have been implemented over the preceding 12 months to lower the property's bushfire risk: mowing and grazing are being used to maintain fuel loads at an acceptable level across the property the access bridge to the property has been upgraded to accommodate an ACTRFS heavy tanker installation of two 80,000 litre tanks dedicated to fire suppression installation of a fire hydrant and booster. a facility specific Emergency Management Plan compliant with AS 3745:2010 Planning for emergencies in Facilities is in place there is a Bushfire Action Plan for the facility and wider property. All services will cease and the facility will be pre -emptively evacuated on days of Extreme or Catastrophic fire danger a BOP was prepared by ACT Health and approved by the ACTRFS, and a Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) rating of 12.5 has been constructed to reflect the facility as a Special Purpose Facility by way of occupancy type. This BAL rating is over and above what is required. In addition, sprinklers have also been installed throughout the facility, over and above normal construction requirements. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 381 Annual Report 2017 -2018 University of Canberra Hospital Construction of University of Canberra Hospital was completed in late 2017. A condition of the Development Approval was a Construction Environmental Management Plan that was developed and approved by Environment Protection Authority, which outlines environmental damage mitigation strategies, including bushfire. The area where University of Canberra Hospital is constructed has been declassified as a bushfire prone area and no longer requires a BOP. This site will only be reported on in future annual reports by exception. Community Services Directorate In preparat ion for the 2017 -18 bushfire season, CSD through Housing and Community Services (HACS), identified 842 properties located in the designated Bushfire Prone Areas (BPA), in line with the information provided by the Emergency Services Agency. The identified p roperties were grouped into three categories to reflect the level of perceived risk and associated impacts on the tenants due to their individual circumstances. The categories also indicate the actions that HACS undertakes to reduce/mitigate the risk to the individual tenancies. Category 1 13 mostly rural properties were inspected on six occasions during the 2017 -18 bushfire season and had the necessary works within the curtilage of the property attended to by the HACS maintenance provider, Spotless. Categ ory 2 83 homes managed by head lessees who carry out the required bushfire mitigation activities; this category includes group homes. Category 3 746 remaining dwellings located in the BPA; the tenants are responsible for mitigating bushfire risks and/or s eeking assistance from the HACS maintenance provider Spotless. In October and September 2017, HACS wrote to residents or the managers of the properties in all categories to make them aware of their responsibilities for bushfire prevention and advising the m of where they can gain further information and/or assistance regarding bushfire threats. HACS provided summary information to ESA regarding the delivery of the bushfire mitigation services throughout the 2017 -18 bushfire season. Education Directorate and Transport Canberra and City Services cooperatively manage Birrigai BOP The Birrigai BOP draft process is progressing. Australian Bushfire Consultants was commissioned to draft a plan for review. In June 2018, ACTRFS undertook a visit to Birrigai to meet stakeholders and look at the larger site area. ACTRFS made further recommendations that will be addressed in the final version. Initial drafts from Australian Bushfire Consultants have been submitted to ACTRFS for comment. The final draft is anticipated to be submitted to the ACTRFS and the ESA Commissioner for approval in the first half of 2018 -19. Cultural Facilities Corporation The Cultural Facilities Corporation (CFC) manages three ACT Historic Places: Lanyon Homestead Calthorpes' House, and Mugga -Mugga Cottage and Education Centre. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 382 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The ACT Historic Places BOPs have been prepared with comprehensive procedures and checklists in place. The BOPs are reviewed annually and involve consultation with ACT Rural Fire Service (ACTRFS) and take into account seasonal variations. Due to Lanyon Homestead's property size, location and multiple tenancies, a BOP has been developed as required by Section 78 of the Emergencies Act 2004 , which includes quarterly progress reporting to ACTRFS. The CFC provides emergency bushfire awareness training for ACT Historic Places staff and volunteer guides, in view of the bushfire risk to these properties as well as regular review of its incident procedures. ICON Water Icon Water's BOP is reviewed annually and approved by the ESA Commissioner. The 2017 -2018 BOP contained the following actions: Hazard reduction for 45 Icon Water sites (the majority of which were urban reservoirs and treatment plants). All hazar d reduction activities proposed were completed by 30 June 2018 (in accordance with the schedule). Deliver Basic Wildfire Awareness training for new operational staff. Icon Water now has more than 100 employees who have undertaken this training. A key suppo rting component of Icon Water's BOP was regular participation in interagency forums such as SEMSOG, Security and Emergency Management Policy Group (SEMPG), Joint Operations Coordination Group (JOCG) and ACTRFS bushfire planning forums. Uriarra Village The Uriarra Village Bushfire Operational Plan was approved by the ESA Commissioner in October 2017 and is current for three years. The BOP has comprehensive procedures and checklists in place. The preparedness activities are checked quarterly by the contractors and on an ad-hoc basis by the Uriarra Village Management Committee which is responsible for the BOP. The next review is scheduled to occur prior to the 2018- 19 Bushfire Season. ACT Farm FireWise Program (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action Items 29 & 30) The A CTRFS manages the ACT Farm FireWise (FFW) program which supports the rural community with their bushfire planning. The FFW program supports land owners by undertaking a risk assessment of their properties to determine the risk treatments or activities required to reduce the impacts of bushfire. As FFW Plans are approved by the ESA Commissioner every five years, they satisfy the requirements of BOPs required under the Emergencies Act 2004 and any bushfire planning required by a Land Management Agreement. There are currently 180 rural leases in the ACT, with 77 of these leases in the Bushfire Abatement Zone (BAZ). During this reporting period the Farm FireWise Program has supported the completion of eight plans, of which four are in the BAZ. The Farm FireWise Program will continue to focus on supporting properties within the BAZ to develop the plans in 2018 -19. One rural lease in the BAZ was transferred to Suburban Land Agency and is now covered by their bi-annual BOP. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 383 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Review of the ACT Bushfire Prone Area Map ( Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action Item 4) The BPA was reviewed and published in May 2017. The revised BPA has adopted a standardised approach to categorising bushfire prone vegetation into classes of hazard. For example, the 2017 mapping considers and incorpo rates the different risks posed by forest, woodlands or grasslands. Areas of intensively managed vegetation (e.g. golf courses, recreation areas, Canberra International Airport, etc.) are also recognised and are no longer considered bushfire prone and the mapping adjusted accordingly. This approach, supported by vegetation data derived from recent aerial imagery and field validation, is consistent with the methodology applied by NSW Rural Fire Service (NSWRFS) and allows certain vegetation types to be excluded. The ACT support NSW Rural Fire Service fire management planning through continued involvement in Regional Bushfire Management Committees (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action 8) The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between ESA and NSWRFS was signed by the relevant Ministers and Commissioners on 12 January 2018. The Mutual Aid Agreement between ESA and NSWRFS was signed by the ACTRFS Chief Officer and NSWRFS on 9 October 2017. To enhance collaborat ive cross border planning and response capability, ACTRFS attended Regional Bushfire Management Committee meetings in Yass, Queanbeyan \u2014 Palerang, Snowy \u2014 Monaro, and Snowy Valley. Cross Border response this reporting year included the Potters Hill fire where NSWRFS provided crews and equipment to assist with control lines and direct attack on the spotover. The ACTRFS was requested to provide a member to sit on the NSWRFS State Strategic Planning Unit during the height of the NSW Bushfire Season. This unit determined resourcing for all fires across NSW. The NSWRFS placed their RART (Rapid Aerial Response Team) helicopter at the Hume Helibase from January to February 2018. The NSWRFS planning team (same as ACT FFW) attended ESA to provide an overview of management practices and landholder engagement on land around the ACT. Memorandum of Understanding for Arson Investigation (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Actions 9 and 10) The MOU between the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the Coroners Court of the ACT, ACT Fire & Rescue and the ACTRFS for \"Service Concerning Investigation of Fires in the ACT\" has been reviewed by all stakeholders and is expected to be endorsed in the first quarter of the 2018-19 financial year. A trial of a Fire Investigation hand over form, (for all fire incidents handed to the AFP) has been in place since January 2018. Based on the success of the trial, this document will be an annexure to the MOU. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 384 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Power Infrastructure and Bushfire Prevention (Schedule 3 of the SBMP, Action Item 11) The SBMP contai ns a requirement that, over the life of the Plan, arrangements will be clarified in relation to vegetation management near power infrastructure, which is a potential source of ignition. During 2017 -18, arrangements were clarified in relation to vegetation near power lines across the ACT. The Utilities (Technical Regulation) Amendment Act 2017 which will commence in early 2018 -19 clarifies that the Provider is responsible for all vegetation clearances near power lines on unleased Territory land in the urban area and non-urban areas (i.e. nature strips, urban parks, national parks and reserves). The Provider is now also responsible for vegetation management and assessing pole condition and replacement at for rural leased land including privately owned poles. The Electricity Powerline Vegetation Management Technical Code will also commence in early 2018 - 19. This code establishes standards for tree pruning practices that the Provider and their contractors must follow. It also requires that the provider submits a Vegetation Management (Bushfire and Environmental) Works Plan showing all proposed vegetation clearing work and investigation of technical solutions to reduce bushfire risk caused by power lines. Supporting of programs that proactively maintain health, fitness and wellbeing of firefighters (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action 14) The 2017 -18 Budget contained funding for a gym membership and similar health initiatives to facilitate $100 payment to ACTRFS volunteers. ACTRFS Fitness Reimbursement Initiative was laun ched in August 2017, allowing members to claim $100 back on eligible purchases made for health and wellbeing products and services. In 2017- 18, 84 members submitted a claim for reimbursement. ACTRFS has started a weekly fitness group allowing members to train for the annual fitness test. This training group also encourages members to socialise with other brigades. ACTRFS was an active participant in the directorate's Physical Activity Working Group. The group focussed on the development of the directorate's 'Live Active' program; a peer-led program to increase the overall wellness of staff and volunteers through individually targeted and evidence- based physical activities. Programs for the recruitment and retention of volunteers (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Actio n 15) During 2017 -18, the ACTRFS developed a flexible membership model to including detailed position descriptions for each new category of membership, continuing to amend the existing policies and procedures, and redesigning the application to join the ACTRFS form to be more user friendly. The ACTRFS will continue to work with ESA Training to develop its systems to better record membership reporting. The ACTRFS is looking at targeted recruiting to improve its workforce diversity and skillsets, and to ident ify what roles are available in the service that aren't front line firefighting. People from non - English speaking backgrounds; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; and people with disabilities are in our target groups. To aid in this the ACTRFS is creating a number of different membership types within the service to allow a pathway for those who do not wish to, or can no longer perform, the role of a frontline firefighter. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 385 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The ACTRFS developed a recognition plan for employers by holding an awards e vening to thank Employers who have been nominated for specific recognition by RFS Volunteers. The inaugural ACTRFS employers Recognition and Awareness evening was held on 27 November 2017. The event demonstrated the importance of an employer and employee relationship and support for volunteer involvement. A wide range of employers were represented and overall we received very positive feedback. Thirteen employers were nominated and 10 attended the evening to receive certificates: Access Canberra Australian Federal Police - ACT Policing Department of Agriculture and Water Australian Maritime Safety Authority ICON Water IQON Pty Ltd Royal Australian Navy Shaw Building Group, and Biometrix Pty Ltd. Following on from this success, the ACTRFS will look at ways to improve the evening and continue developing tools to support both Volunteers and Employers to successfully balance their working lives and commitment to the Service. The ESA Commissioner and ACTRFS Executive arranged a BBQ evening at each of the eight Brigades throughout the reporting period. This provided an opportunity for members to have one- on-one discussion regarding the ACTRFS in general. Members were encouraged to provide feedback and suggest areas for improvement. Some of the topics covered were; equipment, callout procedures/duty officer, training, hazard reduction, community education/awareness, membership recruitment and retention, support roles, interaction between other brigades and HQ, Strategic Bushfire Management Plan and any other topic they wanted to discuss. The information collected at the eight Brigade BBQ's will be collated and a review seminar will be held prior to the 2018-19 bushfire season for all ACTRFS members to bring the feedback together. Pre-incident Operational Plans for Bushfire Response (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action Item 22) Specific pre-incident operational plans were revised or developed for key areas of the Territory to assist ACTF&R and the ACTRFS respond to bushfires. Pre- incident plans that were either developed or reviewed for the 2017-18 bushfire season include: Justice and Community Safety Directorate 386 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Table 83 Pre- Incident Plans Alivio (Motor Village) Mt Mugga Mugga Aranda Spine Pre Fire Plan Mt Rogers Black Mountain Pre Fire Plan Mt St romlo Bruce and O'Connor Ridge Mt Stromlo Water Treatment Plant Canberra Concrete Recyclers Mt Taylor Cooleman Ridge Narrabundah Hill CSIRO Ecosystem Sciences National Arboretum CSIRO Ginninderra Experimental Station Oaks Estate Curtin Grasslands Parkwood Martin Scrap Metal Fyshwick Red Hill Hall Village RSPCA Holt Substation Tharwa Village Isaacs Ridge Uriarra Village Mitchell Waste and Recycling Yarralumla Precinct Annual exercises undertaken to test facilities (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action Items 21) Each year internal and cross-jurisdictional Incident Management Exercises (IMXs) are conducted to prepare for the fire season. ESA attends local IMXs at Fire Control Centres in our surrounding fire districts. The ESA conducted two half-day IMXs in December 2017. The exercises prepared the ESA for the 2017 -18 fire season and targeted operations in bushfire and grassfire incidents. The exercise included multiple ACT response services and multiple affected jurisdictions. The exercises specifically tes ted cross jurisdictional incident management arrangements, two-way communications between the Operational, Tactical and Strategic Levels, and the establishment of multi-service, pre- formed Incident Management Teams (IMTs). The exercises also tested the eff ectiveness of the dissemination of information, warnings and advice, within Government and to the Public utilising existing systems. Capability of real-time visualisation delivery of information between ESA HQ and fire crews (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action Items 23) The ESA uses a number of systems to provide accurate and as close as possible to 'real time' information to our front line crews to enable and support them in their role. Mobile Data Terminals Justice and Community Safety Directorate 387 Annual Report 2017 -2018 installed in front line vehicles link directly to our Computer Aided Dispatch system, and provide location and GPS mapping intelligence to our crews when responding to incidents. Our encrypted Trunked Radio Network enables direct radio communications from the field to our Communications Centre and facilitates the establishment of command channels for incident management. Resource deployment is presented visually to ESA headquarters staff and deployment software helps our operators identify optimum location for crews to stage during periods of high demand. Information sharing across the ACT Government and Commonwealth is available via incident management software that caters both for government communications and bushfire specific operations. The systems ESA uses for communication and data sharing for effective emergency response are: Mobile Data Terminals Territory Radio Network ESA Common Operating Picture Dynamic Coverage Tool ESA Spatial Services ICT platforms to deliver active information to the field and IMT Incident Control On Line , and Emergency Management Operations System ESA Website refresh (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action Items 25) In March 2018, the ESA executed a new five year contract with Adelphi Digital Consulting Group Pty Ltd. Under the contract, Adelphi, who are a local based firm, will work with the ESA to redevelop our existing website, content management and hosting arrangements. Under the current schedule, Adelphi is planning to have the new ESA website ready to go live in October 2018. Adelphi is also working with the wider Directorate to review and refresh a number of other websites including ACT Corrective Services, ACT Government Solicitors Office and the directorate. Develop a plan with location and timing of fuel-reduction activities for 2019 -24 (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action 34) A joint agency Steering Committee has been formed to manage the development the Regional Fire Management Plan 2019 -2029 . The Steering Committee agencies are the ESA including ACTRFS and EPSDD including PCS, Conservation Planning and Research, and the Conservator. The plan will be developed for a ten-year period with a five-year review with PCS as the lead agency for the project. The holding of an Annual Bushfire Planning Forum between agencies to identify future planning requirement and potential constraints (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action 57) A Bushfire Planning Forum between ACT Government agencies was held on 28 August 2017. The function of the Bushfire Planning Forum provides strategic level oversight, advice and collaborative inf ormation sharing, focusing on: identifying and discussing capital works and other major activities which may affect bushfire planning or response, e.g. actions restricting firefighting access or mitigation activities Justice and Community Safety Directorate 388 Annual Report 2017 -2018 identifying and discussing capital works and other major activities which may affect the bushfire operational plan (BOP), activities, or planning of another directorate or agency identifying and discussing capital works and other major activities which may trigger or require signi ficant environ mental assessment identifying and discussing capital works and other major activities which may trigger or require major changes to existing land use or land management identifying and highlighting future planning requirements and potential constraints, and reviewing and discussing risks, issues, and determining appropriate course of action based on recommendations. The Annual Bushfire Planning Forum will be held each year prior to the commencement of the Bushfire Season. CBR Bushfire Ready Campaign (Schedule 3 of the SBMP Action Items 47 - 49) The CBR Bushfire Ready campaign was first undertaken in 2015-16 and is delivered every Bushfire Season. It involves the delivery of a targeted message by emergency service volunteers and staff to Canberrans living near the urban bushland interface to prepare their homes, property and families for potential bushfires and natural disasters. The CBR Bushfire Ready campaign in 2017-18 demonstrated the positive influence of delivering community education in an integrated and coordinated approach. With a focus on reaching out to older Canberrans and their carers as well as the general community, the 2017-18 doorknock campaign reached a total 1000 residences across 25 suburbs as well as the rural communities of Tharwa, Uriarra and Hall. This has encouraged the ACT community to take greater responsibility for their safety by acting on information, advice and other cues provided before an emergency. ACT Emergency Services Open Day The ACT Emergency Services Open Day held on 29 Oc tober 2017 was coordinated by ACTRFS and included a range of field day type activities to demonstrate the ESA's range of capabilities. With well over 5000 members of the public attending, the event also showcased all aspects of emergency management in the ACT. This included displays and activities from all of ESA's services, tours through the Incident Management Room and Emergency Coordination Centre, and the presence of a variety of community groups. The day was supported by ACT Policing and the CSD, who also have an emergency management role. National Disaster Resilience Program The Natural Disaster Resilience Program is a grants program offered by the Commonwealth Government to all States and Territories under a National Partnership Agreement for Natural Disaster Resilience. The Program provides funding to governments and community organisations to improve their natural disaster resilience. The ACT used this funding in 2017-18 on the Electronic Fire Danger Ratin g Signs (EFDRS). These signs have been installed at high traffic volume sites to inform the maximum number of people of the fire danger rating. These new signs will supplement the existing manually updated EFDRS Justice and Community Safety Directorate 389 Annual Report 2017 -2018 signs, however have the advantage of being automatically updated from a live feed, and also have the capacity to display an additional text message via the LED display. The locations of the new signs are: Table 84 Electronic Fire Danger Rating Signs Street Direction Suburb Barton Highway Eastbound Lanes Gold Creek Canberra Avenue Westbound Harmen Federal Highway Parkway Northbound Arboretum William Hovell Drive Eastbound Cook Figure 69 Electronic Fire Danger Sign Fire danger sign Justice and Community Safety Directorate 390 Annual Report 2017 -2018 O.2 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION Introduction In order to meet the requirements under both the Freedom of Information Act 1989 and the Freedom of Information Act 2016 under the Annual Report Directions , the information provided is across two discreet periods of time: 1 July 2017 to 31 Decem ber 2017 - Freedom of Information Act 1989 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2018 - Freedom of Information Act 2016 Section O.2 contains what constitutes the Minister's annual report under section 96 of the Freedom of Information Act 2016 .

Issues identified in any ACT Health Bills as a result of the Legislative Assembly's scrutiny process are also addressed. In 2017-18, ACT Health prepared 37 Cabinet submissions. One submission related to a Justice and Community Safety Directorate 412 Annual Report 2017 -2018 legislative proposal, the Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 2018 .

Following their enactment in the last two years, ACT Health is actively reviewing these pieces of legislation, with a focus on how these are working in practice, the extent to which they are impacting on HR and whether these impacts are proportionate. In doing this, ACT Health is working closely with a wide range of stakeholders, includ ing clinical staff and consumer groups. Litigation There was no litigation that ACT Health was involved in during 2017-18 that included any arguments concerning the HR Act. Canberra Institute of Technology Education and training of staff on human rights principles The Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT) Executive, directors and senior managers attended a training session on HR that was delivered by HRC in February 2018.

The second complaint was made to the HRC in 2017 which was referred to ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal (ACAT ) by the HRC in 2018, at the request of the Complainant. This matter is currently being considered by ACAT. Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate Education and training of staff on human rights principles The Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate (CMTEDD) is committed to a workplace that respects, protects and promotes HR principles. The CMTEDD New Starter Resource Kit includes infor mation on Respect Equity and Diversity (RED) including who the appointed RED Executive Sponsor is for CMTEDD, and a list of 32 nominated Respect, Equity and Diversity Contact Officers (REDCOs) across CMTEDD, whose responsibility it is to promote RED in the workplace and offer support, guidance and information to staff.

The Triple Bottom Line assessments incorporated into all Cabinet submission proposing policy changes provides requirements for the assessment of social impacts including an evaluation of the proposal's impact on the HR Act. The Cabinet Handbook, Legislation Handbook and t he Human Rights Act 2004 - Guidelines for ACT Departments: Developing Legislation and Policy are extensively consulted during the development of legislation; with due regard being given to HR issues. Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on HR principles or the legislative scrutiny process CMTEDD liaised with the HRU within the directorate on a number of matters relating to: the preparation of legislative proposals for the Red Tape Reduction Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 the preparation of new legislation for changes to the greyhound racing industry through the Racing (Greyhounds) Amendment Bill 2017 and the Domestic Animals (Racing Greyhounds) Amendment Bill 2017 subordinate legislation, the Residential Tenancies Amendment Regulation 2018 (No 1); preparation of legislative proposals to improve information sharing in relation to the ACT's Reportable Conduct Scheme through the Reportable Conduct and Information Sharing Amendment Act 2017 as notified on 12 December 2017 prepara tion of legislative proposals to expand the ACT's Reportable Conduct Scheme to more fully include religious organisations through the Ombudsman Amendment Act 2018 as notified on 14 June 2018 preparation of the Workplace Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 the Work Health and Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2018 and associated Work Health and Safety Amendment Regulation 2018 , and the Controlled Sports Bill 2018 and subsequent policy and legislative development. During drafting of amendments to improve the scope of the ACT's Reportable Conduct Scheme in 2017, and to expand the scheme in 2018, officers within the directorate and CMTEDD consulted closely to ensure appropriate protections under the HR ACT to: S9 Right to life; S10 Protection from torture and cruel, from inhuman or degrading treatment; S11 Protection of family and children; S12 Privacy and reputation; and S14 Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief. Officers' discussion centred on the use of S28 of the HR Act which allows for reasonable li mitation of human rights by law that can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The Environment Protection Authority worked with the HRC in the resolution of a ten year on- going complaint about noise from the Griffith shops, in particu lar, excessive noise from garbage trucks and Justice and Community Safety Directorate 415 Annual Report 2017 -2018 air-conditioners/refrigerating condenser noise from one of the shops.

Access Canberra provided the HRC with all information requested. WorkSafe ACT has had two interactions with the HRC regarding allegations of bullying in a workplace. WorkSafe ACT continues to work with the HRC as it investigates the allegations. Within the Workplace Safety and Industrial Relations Division five new legislative proposals were developed and all received human rights compatibility statements. The Work Health and Safety Legislation Amendment Act 2018 and associated Work Health and Safety Amendment Regulation 2018 both received comment from the Scrutiny Committee. These comments were in relation to: ensuring that documents adopted into the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 would be publicly accessible. To address this concern technical amendments were made to the notes in the amending Act to alert readers to the fact that such documents would be available for access by the public free of charge the cr eation of new strict liability offences under the amending regulation and the fact that these were not addressed in terms of HR implications in the Explanatory Statement for the amending regulation. In 2018 -19 a response will be prepared to address the HR implications of the new strict liability offences. The Workplace Health and Safety Amendment Bill 2018 was introduced on 7 June 2018 and as such has not yet been reviewed by the Scrutiny Committee. During preparation of the Workplace Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 in relation to the recovery of overpayments, the HRC raised some concerns about including appropriate safeguards to take account of hardship factors and the application of an objective test of reasonableness to repayment arrangements. As a result of these comments, the Bill was amended to include a range of factors specified in clauses 4(a)-(e) that the Head of Service will have regard to when determining repayment arrangements which includes the employee's financial circumstances. The explanatory statement details that financial circumstances may include any hardship faced by the employee and provides for a broad interpretation of hardship, including (but not be excluded to): family tragedy, serious illness, impacts of natural disaster and other serious or difficult circumstances. Reviews or preparations for reviews of existing legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act Reviews of Bills and Acts included: Revenue Legislation Amendment Act 2018 Land Tax Amendment Act 2018 Planning and D evelopment (Lease Variation Charge Deferred Payment Scheme) Amendment Act 2018 Litigation There were no cases before courts or tribunals which have involved arguments concerning the HR Act.

In 2017 -18 the course was completed by 52 Community Service Directorate (CSD) staff and as at 30 June 2018 another 17 staff were undertaking the course. The Public Advocate , Human Rights Commissioner/Children and Young People Commissioner and Official Visitors attend the induction training and host an information session on what services they offer young people in custody and the wider community. In addition to this, as part of the implementation of the new CSD Complaints Handling and Management Policy (CHAMP), Housing ACT secured 180 training spaces with the NSW Ombudsman on best practice in this area. The two courses covered both frontline complaints and managing unreasonable complainant conduct. Founded in HR principles and the recognition of the universal nature of human dignity, the training provided practical strategies for respectful treatment, apology, safe management of escalating behaviour and other elements of best practice complaints han dling. Bimberi Charter of Rights A Charter of Rights for Young People in Bimberi Youth Justice Centre was implemented in 2017 to further strengthen the protection of young people in Bimberi. It outlines the special rights young people in detention have to protection, rehabilitation and support. It helps young people understand how they can expect to be treated and how they should treat others while at Bimberi. The Charter requires Bimberi staff, police and other workers to act in line with the 12 rights and to consider human rights when developing policies, delivering services and making decisions. All young people entering Bimberi are provided with the Charter and an opportunity to discuss it with staff. In addition to this, an e- Learning course 'Bimberi Charter of Rights' was developed and made available to Bimberi staff on 4 September 2017. As at 30 June 2018, 25 Bimberi staff had completed the course, with a further 4 staff currently in progress. The Bimberi Charter of Rights e-Learning course is included as part of the Bimberi Induction Learning Pathway on the Capability Learning Management System. The Charter was developed in consultation with key stakeholders, including young people in Bimberi and the HRC. The Charter is available at www.communityservices.act.gov.au . Justice and Community Safety Directorate 417 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Internal dissemination of information to staff on the legislative scrutiny process Government messages in relation to HR are made available to all staff, including notices of train ing opportunities through whole- of-directorate emails and via the CSD training calendar. Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on human rights principles or the legislative scrutiny process Liaison with HRU is required for the preparation of legislation to clarify and identify possible impacts. Relevant descriptions are included in explanatory statements and regulatory impact statements where relevant. In 2017 -18, the directorate consulted with HRU in the development of a number of bills and legislation. T he Children and Young People Amendment Bill 2018 and Senior Practitioner Bill 2018 were of particular importance given the nature of their subject material. The Children and Young People Amendment Bill 2018 was introduced in the ACT Legislative Assembly on 10 May 2018. The Bill improves interpretation of the Children and Young People Act 2008 to guide decisionmaking for children, young people and their families. The Bill also gives full effect to important elements of A Step Up for Our Kids - One Step Can Make a Lifetime of Difference (Out of Home Care Strategy 2015 -2020). The purpose of the Bill is to: clarify the way care and protection appraisals are carried out consolidate delegations and enable sub delegation to enable decisions to be made closer to a child or young person, and correct unintended consequences of previous amendments, including the power to revoke carer authorisation. These amendments respond to Government commitments to remove legislative barriers to effectively undertake appraisals and to fully realise the reforms under A Step Up for Our Kids to enable sub-delegation of responsible person duties. A Human Rights Compatibility Statement was issued by the directorate to support the progress of this Bill. The Senior Practitioner Bill 2018 es tablishes the role and functions of a Senior Practitioner in the ACT was introduced to the Legislative Assembly on 7 June 2018. The bill pertains specifically to restrictive practices in the ACT in the disability space and the directorate worked closely with the HRC on the development and refinement of the Bill. A Human Rights Act Compatibility Statement was issued by the directorate to support the progress of this Bill. The ACT Government has previously agreed to two national frameworks: the National Framework for Reducing and Eliminating the Use of Restrictive Practices in the Disability Sector and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguarding Framework. These two imperatives and the associated Regulatory Impact Statement give clear timeframes for the establishment of a Senior Practitioner in the ACT. The extensive consultation undertaken by JFA Purple Orange in 2017 highlighted uncertainty around the issue of restrictive practices, and found that community members have clear expectation s of the Justice and Community Safety Directorate 418 Annual Report 2017 -2018 benefits a senior practitioner will bring to regulation, adjudication and reduction of restrictive practices. The Bill will allow the protection of the most vulnerable people in the ACT and prevent harm from the unnecessary use of restrictive practices. The Bill is supported by section 10 - protection from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment and section 11 - protection of the family and children, of the HR Act. Reviews or preparations for reviews of existing legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act CSD engages in regular consultation with the HRU section of the directorate and the HRC on proposed Bills and legislative amendments. Liaison with HR advisors is required in relation to the preparation of subordinate legislation to clarify and identify possible impacts. Relevant descriptions are included in regulatory impact statements and explanatory statements. Housing ACT is conscious of its HR responsibilities when decision making. The Housing and Tenancy Review Panel, who consider reviews of reviewable decisions and requests to remove housing assistance from tenants in line with Housing ACT policies and process also ensure that Human Rights considerations are at the forefront of decision making. CSD, in partnership with the HRC, will seek to review the Therapeutic Protection Order provision of the Children and Young Peoples Act to respond to contemporary understanding of best practice and the Human Rights principle. Litigation During 2017 -18, there was one matter before ACAT where human rights was raised in a substantive way. The Tribunal found in the Commissioner's favour on the substantive application. Cultural Facilities Corporation Education and training of staff on human rights principles The Cultural Facilities Corporation (CFC) is committed to a workplace that respects, protects and promotes HR principles. During the reporting period, staff participated in a range of training and professional development opportunities. RED training was conducted in -house. Development opportunities were provided to advance skills and knowledge and to collaboratively contribute to positive work cultures. There is one appointed RED contact officer to promote RED in the workplace and offer support, guidance and information to staff. During the year, the CFC undertook a range of HR related activities including: the CFC's CEO hosted a morning tea for International Women's Day in March 2018 for CFC staff, voluntee rs and women community members with a particular link to the work of the CFC the CFC's CEO also hosted an International Women's Day lunch for women Board members and senior staff, with a guest speaker Justice and Community Safety Directorate 419 Annual Report 2017 -2018 the presentation of the 2017 Don Aitkin Awards took pla ce in December 2017 which recognises staff contributions and achievements throughout the year The CFC's Human Resources area ensures that staff have access to, and are aware of, the Employee Assistance Program through dissemination of information and signa ge in the workplace. Internal dissemination of information to staff on the legislative scrutiny process ACT Government messages in relation to HR topics are made available to all staff, including notices of training opportunities. Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on human rights principles or the legislative scrutiny process The CFC did not engage with the HRU on HR principles or the legislative scrutiny process during 2017 - 18. Reviews or preparations for reviews of existing legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act No reviews occurred. Litigation There were no cases before courts or tribunals which involved arguments concerning the HR Act. Education Directorate Education and training of staff on human rights principles There are 90 nomi nated REDCOs across the Education Directorate. Of these designated contact officers, 80 are located in public schools. The role of the REDCOs is to provide comprehensive information and support to empower their colleagues. To achieve this, REDCOs provide information on the avenues available to staff who are experiencing work bullying, discrimination and or harassment, as well as modelling and promoting behaviour that is acceptable and professional. Mandatory training for newly appointed REDCOs is held each year in the first quarter of the year, with quarterly network meetings held in the remaining quarters. The network meetings are designed professional development workshops that focus on key issues raised by REDCOs and assist contact officers to meet the role, responsibilities and expectations as outlined in the REDCO Guidelines. The Education Directorate does not keep data centrally on staff attending training sessions involving HR principles. The Education Directorate continues its commitment to the human rights principles through supporting the following diversity staff networks. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 420 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Staff Network The directorate supports the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Staff Network. Membership is open to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees; including permanent, contract and casual staff. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander pre-service teachers in the ACT are offered associate membership of the Staff network to establish relationships and connections within the Directorate. The Staff Network meets quarterly with the Education Governance Committee to discuss strategic policy initiatives, including cultural integrity and workplace cultural safety. Accessibility Advisory Group The Accessibility Advisory Group established in 2017 is a consultative mechanism for employees with disability. The group has met regularly to provide input into the development of the EDU Access and Inclusion Employment Action Plan. The group has a presence on the ACTPS Disability Allies Netwo rk, coordinated by the Inclusion Team, Workforce Capability and Governance Division, CMTEDD. Increased membership of the Education Accessibility Advisory Group will be encouraged, coinciding with the launch of the Education Access and Inclusion Employment Action Plan in 2018. LGBTIQ Staff Network An information session to establish an LGBTIQ Staff Network was held on 16 May 2018. The group engaged in a rich discussion regarding the vision and structure of the network and group agreement for ongoing developm ent meetings. It was also agreed that allies who want to make positive and real contributions are welcome into the Network. Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on human rights principles or the legislative scrutiny process The Education Directorate cons ults with the HRC, where relevant, in the preparation of cabinet submissions, including government submissions to the Legislative Assembly and in the development of new and amended legislation. In the preparation of cabinet submissions, the Education Directorate considers the impact of recommendations on HR matters. The Education Directorate policies and procedures refer to the HR Act where this is relevant. These include: Managing Occupational Violence Policy Safe and Supportive Schools Policy Students wit h a Disability: Meeting their Educational Needs Policy Dress Standards and Uniforms in Canberra Public Schools Policy, and Complaints Policy. Policies are available at http://www.education.act.gov.au/publications_and_policies/policy_a-z . The HRC is an important external stakeholder and is consulted where policies and procedures that may have HR implications are being reviewed or developed. Public Advocate and Children and Young People Commissioner Ms Jodie Griffiths- Cook, was a member of ACT Education Directorate's Advisory Group for the Review of the Suspension, Transfer or Exclusion in ACT Public Schools Policy. This group was established to provide early consultation and input into revised policy documents and met three times during 2017. The HRC joined colleagues from the Education Directorate and other key education stakeholders - including the Australian Justice and Community Safety Directorate 421 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Education Union, ACT Parent and Citizens Association, Child Youth and Protection Services, Youth Coalition of the ACT and Barnardos on the group. Ms Griffiths-Cook attended the advisory group meetings and provided written feedback on the draft policy, procedures and guidelines. Feedback from Ms Griffiths-Cook was considered very helpful and included advice on the wording which describes the relationship between the HR Act and the policy. The policy documents are anticipated to progress to community consultation in term three, 2018 and the HRC will be invited to contribute further input. Litigation During 2017 -18, the directorate responded to three matters in the ACAT . Two of the matters were closed by HRC in 2016-17 and referred to the ACAT during 2017-18. Both of these matters related to complaints of unlawful discrimination; one on the grounds of relationship status, profession, trade occupation or calling, and status as a parent or carer in the areas of employment and education, and the other on the ground of disability in the areas of education and provision of goods, services or facilities. Both of these matters were subsequently withdrawn. The third matter was a complaint of unlawful discrimination on the basis of age in relation to employment. It was closed by the HRC and refer red to the ACAT during 2017 -18. This matter is ongoing. Environment, Planning and Sustainable Development Directorate Education and training of staff on human rights principles The Legal Services section regularly educates staff on the need to consider HR in day- to-day decision- making, including the operation of the HR Act, for example via all staff communications from the Chief Operating Officer . The importance of HR including in the development of legislation, subordinate legislation and other instruments has been underlined in presentations from time to time, including to the directorate's Performance and Business Management Committee, as well as in discussions on the devel opment of specific legislative proposals and operational issues. EPSDD staff undertake a range of training that supports and promote HR. All new staff are trained on the ACTPS RED framework through an in-house training induction program and via the ACT Government Shared Services Training and Development Calendar. The RED framework aims to foster a workplace that values individual differences and is respectful, courteous and fair. RED training includes information on legislative obligations including the HR Act. In addition, the directorate also offers a dedicated session on equity, diversity and inclusion. Training is tailored for managers, staff and RED contact officers. HR is also supported through the introduction of other training sessions regarding Disability and Cultural Awareness. Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on human rights principles or the legislative scrutiny process EPSDD engages in regular consultation with the HRU of the directorate on proposed Bills, regulations and other legislative amendments. Key pieces of legislation informed by HR section advice and input Justice and Community Safety Directorate 422 Annual Report 2017 -2018 during 2017 -18 include the Lakes Amendment Bill 2017 in relation to the inclusion of strict liability offences and safety directions powers, and the Building and Construction Leg islation Bill 2017 in relation to information sharing. HR Act compatibility statements were provided for each Bill and Act. The explanatory statements for the Bills and Acts contained detailed analysis of HR impacts, including where the provisions had appr opriate and justifiable limits on HR and where the provisions positively supported HR. EPSDD also contacts the HRU of the directorate to consult on the preparation of subordinate legislation. This consultation is undertaken to clarify and identify possible HR impacts and analysis and descriptions are included in the regulatory impact statements and explanatory statements that accompany the subordinate legislation. HR impacts have been considered in relation to the development of legislation for potential presentation in the Assembly in 2018- 19. Reviews or preparations for reviews of existing legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act EPSDD reviews existing legislation on an ongoing basis, taking into account the continued efficacy of the legislation, including HR impacts. During 2017-18, all Bills were assessed as being compatible with the HR Act before being tabled in the Legislative Assembly. Litigation There were no litigation matters that raised HR issues during the 2017-18 financial year. Justice and Community Safety Directorate Education and training of staff on human rights principles During the reporting period, 55 staff participated in training relating to HR principles. The training included: Human Rights for ACT Public Authorities Opening up equality in the ACT: The new discrimination grounds and beyond Annual Castan Centre for Human Rights Law Conference. The Human Rights and Opening up equality training were conducted by the HRC. An overview of the HR Act was included as part of Induction to all new operational staff of the ACT Corrective Services (ACTCS). The directorate participated in HR related activities including: 10th Anniversary of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) on 13 September 2017. This event w as co -hosted by the HRC and the ACT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body. Staff joined the celebration and watched a film screening of the award - winning 'Zach's Ceremony', a sensitive exploration of a young Aboriginal man's cultural awakening Mental Health Week International Day of People with Disability Justice and Community Safety Directorate 423 Annual Report 2017 -2018 appreciation of the spiritual significance of Ngunnawal cultural ceremony on 24 November 2017 as part of the HRC's efforts to meaningfully act on section 27(2) of the ACT Human Rights Act 2004 Marriage Equity: Where to Now?

Internal dissemination of information to staff on the legislative scrutiny process The HRU within Legislation, Policy and Programs branch of the directorate continues to undertake scrutiny of government bills that are due for presentation to the Legislative Assembly, as required under section 37 of the HR A ct. The HRU provides general advice to other directorates and public sector agencies about whether policy or decisions engage rights, the nature and scope of specific rights and how to assess and justify whether a limitation on a right is reasonable. The HRU encourages early consultation on human rights issues, including those arising under regulations and instruments, to ensure policies, procedures, instruments and legislation are ultimately compatible with rights under the HR Act. Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on human rights principles or the legislative scrutiny process The HRU has advised business units, within the directorate and across ACT Government, on HR compliance and reasonable limitations of rights during 2017-18, including as part of its legislative scrutiny function and at earlier stages during policy development. This engagement has routinely included suggesting refinements to the policy expression or implementation, explanatory materials or drafting to improve compatibility. Key legislation informed by HRU advice and input during 2017-18 included the Lakes Amendment Bill 2018, Veterinary Practice Bill 2018 and the Utilities (Powerline Fire Safety) Amendment Bill 2017. The HRU has also liaised with ACT Government business units to help them better articulate in explanatory statements the justification for limitations on rights with reference to the criteria in section 28 of the HR Act. Early engagement with business units to provide constructive solutions- focused input on HR Act issues in the development of government policy and legislation remains a key focus. The HRU also prepared and delivered two interactive information sessions for officers in the directorate's Legislation, Policy and Programs' Civil and Criminal Law teams and draft ers in the ACT Parliamentary Counsel's Office. These sessions prioritised discussion of the nature of commonly engaged rights, including the right to equality (section 8 HRA), right to privacy and reputation Justice and Community Safety Directorate 424 Annual Report 2017 -2018 (section 12 HRA) and the rights to fair trial (section 21 HRA) and presumption of innocence (section 22(1)) HRA) in the context of strict and absolute liability offences. Approximately 30 officers attended over the two sessions. The HRU receiving positive feedback from more than 75% of officers in the ACT Parliamentary Counsel's Office who attended the session. Attendees strongly agreed the sessions were helpful, structured, and informative and that the HRU responded effectively to questions. The directorate consults with the HRC, where relevant, in the preparation of Cabinet submissions, including those dealing with government submissions to committees of the ACT Legislative Assembly and the development of new and amending legislation. ACTCS continues to work closely with the HRC with regard to HR and health services issues. The HRC is a member of the Alexander Maconochie Centre (AMC) Oversight Working Group which provides a cooperative forum for scrutiny of the centre's operations. A representative from the HRC attended the AMC Oversight Working Group which provided a collaborative forum to consider arising thematic issues and assist with continuous improvement ACTCS has worked cooperatively with both the Human Rights and Discrimination Commissioner and the Health Services Commissioner in managing complaints and issues. In 2017 -18, ACTCS received 18 complaints from the HRC. In six of the cases the complaints were resolved, finding that ACTCS had not acted in a manner inconsistent with the HR Act. However, 12 complaints from the Human Rights and Health Services Commissioners remain ongoing. The directorate consults with the HRC, where relevant, in the preparation of cabinet submissions, including government submissions to the Legislative Assembly and in the development of new and amended legislation. Reviews or preparations for reviews of existing legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act During the year, 54 Bills were assessed as being compatible with the HR Act before being tabled in the Legislative Assembly. Litigation In 2017 -18, one complai nant raised HR Act issues in litigation against the Director-General the directorate. Suburban Land Agency Education and training of staff on human rights principles During the reporting period the Suburban Land Agency undertook a range of actions to suppo rt HR related awareness, including: supporting nationally significant events including White Ribbon Day, R U OK? Day, International Day for People with Disability, International Women's Day, National Youth Week, National Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC Week providing access to training including the RED Framework, disability awareness training, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Awareness training Justice and Community Safety Directorate 425 Annual Report 2017 -2018 implementation of regular staff awards to recognise individuals who displayed and exemplified the signature ACT Public Service values and behaviours of Respect, Integrity, Collaboration or Innovation . Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on human rights principles or the legislative scrutiny process Under the Service Level Agreement between the EPSDD and the Suburban Land Agency, EPSDD is responsible for processes in relation to legislative development and scrutiny to ensure HR and other legal policy matters are considered in the development of legislation projects. This includes the proper consideration and documentation of HR compliance matters. The Suburban Land Agency actively supported and engaged with the EPSDD during these processes. Reviews or preparations for reviews of existing legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act No legislation reviews occurred in the reporting period. Future reviews will be led by the EPSDD and will include consideration of compatibility with the HR Act. Litigation There were no issues of HR litigation involving the Suburban Land Agency in the reporting period. Transport Canberra and City Services Directorate Education and training of staff on human rights principles There was no specified education and training of staff on HR principles during the reporting period. Liaison with the Human Rights Advisors on human rights principles or the legislative scrutiny process Over the reporting period there were four bills presented to the Assembly by the Minister for Transport and City Services. All of these Bills raised rights issues. Consultation with the directorate's HRU was undertaken to ensure that offence provision amendments in the Domestic Animals Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 conformed to legal policy requirements for strict liability offences under HR law. The bill followed an earlier, pr ivate members bill which made changes to the Domestic Animals Act 2000 in relation to dangerous dogs. Government amendments to the private members bill were developed in consultation with the HRC and the directorate's HRU. HR issues that were considered included administrative review, limitations on property rights and fair trial rights. The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Amendment Bill 2017 introduced the Container Deposit Scheme. Strict liability offences in this bill engage human rights and were discussed in the explanatory statement. An anomaly in the Tree Protection Act 2005 was corrected in a Bill which also clarified a person's right to seek merit review of a decision about the cancellation or the refusal to cancel the registration of a tree. The Bill positively engaged human rights as it provides an accountability Justice and Community Safety Directorate 426 Annual Report 2017 -2018 mechanism for independent merits review of administrative decisions that may affect the interests of individuals. The Veterinary Practitioners Bill 2018, which will be debated in the 2018 -19 financial year, engages a number of rights of individuals. Limitations on the rights of individuals who will be regulated under the bill were carefully considered and justification presented to the Assembly in the explanatory statement. The work followed consultation with the HRC and the directorate's HRU. The consultation resulted in shifting amendments from those originally proposed so that limitations on individual rights were minimised to the greatest extent possible to still achieve the policy outcomes of the legislation. The limitations on veterinary practitioners who will be regulated by the Act are balanced against animal welfare and safety and community safety. Reviews or preparations for reviews of existing legislation for compatibility with the Human Rights Act No legislative reviews occurred in the reporting period. Future reviews of portfolio legislation are in planning and while these reviews will predominantly consider the application of the law and changes to that application, the broader issues of compatibility with the HR Act will form part of any review work. Litigation There were no cases before courts or tribunal that involved specific arguments concerning the HR Act although issues of fairness and equity particularly with employm ent matters and challenges to administrative decisions were raised. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 427 Annual Report 2017 -2018 O.4 LEGAL SERVICES DIRECTIONS Agency Compliance - Report Under Section 15 (2) of the Law Officers Act 2011 Under Section 15 of the Law Officers Act 2011 , agencies must report the measures taken during the financial year to ensure compliance with legal services directions issued by the Attorney-General. The Law Officers (General) Legal Services Directions 2012 (the Directions) and Model Litigant Guidelines 2010 (the Guidelines) detail the compliance requirements of all reporting entities. These include: claims and litigation brought by or against the Territory or an agency are handled honestly and fairly, consistent with the intent of the Guidelines all settlements are on the basis of legal principle and practice where the existence of meaningful prospects of liability is established and based on advice of the ACT Government Solicitor (ACTGS) provision of legal services is by the ACTGS or, where outsourced, this occurs with the approval of the Solicitor-General, and ACTGS advice is sought in relation to contracts where the proposal is categorised as high risk, valued at $50 million (or above) or involves non- routine contractual arrangements. The ACTGS assists directorates and other government agencies to understand and comply with the Directions. This occurs through a range of activities and reporting arrangements which bring to the attention of the Director-General the legal service engaging with ACTGS. Arrangements generally implemented by directorates and agencies to achieve compliance with the Directions have been identified as: centralised co -ordination arrangements in most directorates for the making of legal service requests and advice handling a requirement for staff to follow the relevant directorate's standard operating protocol, developed in consultation with the ACTGS, and which are designed to ensure compliance with the Directions informing staff of the Guidelines and the obligations to comply with these acting fairly in the conduct of civil claims and litigation, arbitration and alternative dispute resolution processes close liaison between in-house directorate legal units and ACTGS, and early engagement between directorates the ACT Insurance Agency and ACTGS on civil claims. Where th e ACTGS acts for an agency, a Director-General is able to rely upon the ACTGS to identify those matters where a question arises as to compliance with the Directions. The ACTGS will address or elevate the issue with the instructing agency appropriately. Within this framework, the ACTGS complies with the Directions and assists agencies to do so by: monitoring to ensure that any outsourcing of legal services is only effected with the approval of the Solicitor-General but is consistent with relevant procurement arrangements maintaining close liaison with agencies to manage major government contracts to ensure timely legal advice is sought working with in -house directorate legal units and arrangements including outposting ACTGS lawyers in a number of directorates to support operations Justice and Community Safety Directorate 428 Annual Report 2017 -2018 briefing external counsel in accordance with ACTGS internal processes, consistent with the Directions and, at fees not exceeding the maximum approved by the Attorney-General applying legal principle and practice to the settlement of claims, and ensuring Directors-General are aware of the scope of legal services sought by agencies. Breaches In addition to ACTGS oversight, Directors- General and Chief Executive Officers of agencies to which the Directions apply were requested in writing twice during 2017-18 to indicate to the Solicitor-General the management strategies and practices adopted by their agencies to achieve compliance with the Directions. No breaches of the Guidelines have been notified to, or identified by, the Solicitor-Gene ral. In 2017 -18 the expenditure on external legal service providers approved who provided legal services where ACTGS was unable to were valued at $213,355.93. Reporting on Counsel Expenditure appears below. ACT Government Solicitor Counsel Fees Counsel Engagement by Worktype The figure below provides an indication of the areas of legal service activity (worktypes) in which counsel assistance was engaged during 2017-18. A total of $2.8 million was expended on counsel. Figure 70 2017 -18 ACTGS Counsel Expenditure -% of Expenditure by Worktype Female Counsel A profile of the types of matters for which counsel is engaged in the below table.

This policy has a long-term target which ultimately aims to brief women in at lea st 30 per cent matters (where Counsel is required) and paying 30 per cent of the value of all brief fees by 2020. In 2017 -18, the number of Counsel who were engaged by ACTGS included 27% women Counsel. Of the total expenditure for external Counsel engaged in the types of matters identified in Table 1, expenditure on women Counsel accounted for 30% of the total.

Subsequently, the Minister for Corrections, Shane Rattenbury MLA, established an independent inquiry to look into the treatment and care of Mr Freeman. Mr Philip Moss AM led this review and his report, entitled ' So much s adness in our lives ' had a number of recommendations, one of which related to improving review of critical incidents at the AMC. In responding to this recommendation the Minister went further, announcing the establishment of an independent inspectorate with the mandate to investigate critical incidents as well as conduct regular reviews of correctional centres and services, and to provide recommendations so as to focus on continual improvement of treatment and care. The concept of independent review and preventive oversight of prisons had been raised previously by the ACT Human Rights Commissioner in a 2007 Human Rights Audit on the Operation of ACT Correctional Facilities under Corrections Legislation (the now closed Belconnen Remand Centre). Indeed, it is a model that is gaining prominence in Australia. Since the establishment of the Western Australian Office of the Inspector of Custodial Services in 2000, there have been prison inspectorates established in NSW in 2012 and Tasmania in 2016. Furthermore, it links closely with the approach now required in all jurisdictions in Australia following Australia's ratification of a UN Treaty, the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) in December 2017. Australia has until the start of 2021 for each jurisdiction to nominate an independent entity or entities that will regularly visit closed environments and provide recommendations to authorities for continual improvement. Once nominated these entities will form part of Australia's National Preventive Mechanism (NPM). Whilst the ACT Government has not yet nominated ACT's aspect of the NPM, there is now an extensive body of work on preventive monitoring methodology and human rights guidance which is already proving instrumental in carrying out our work in the ACT. I am also mindful that the Act requires that by the end of 2019, the Inspector 's mandate will expand to cover the Bimberi youth justice facility. Whilst there is plenty of work to do in the current phase of establishing the office and in relation to adult corrections, I am mindful of the additional responsibilities and what needs to be done to prepare for the inclusion of Bimberi in our mandate. By end of the 2017 -18 financial year the Office of the Inspector of Correctional Services (OICS) has only been in operation for just over three months. However, in this time there are already many in the ACT that have offered invaluable support, assistance and guidance. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Dr Helen Watchirs, President of the ACT Human Rights Commission; Mr Russell Taylor the independent chair of an oversight steering committee working on implementing the Moss Report recommendations; and many other individuals and organisations who have shared their insights with me. I am also particularly grateful for the support I have received from Ms Rebecca Minty as the Senior Implementation Adviser. Neil McAllister Inspector of Correctional Services for the ACT August 2018 Justice and Community Safety Directorate 436 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Overview Background The Inspector of Correctional Services Act 2017 (ACT) (the Act) sets out the basis for the establishment of the OICS and its powers and functions. The Act commenced on 8 December 2017. The appointment of the Inspector has the objective of providing continuous improvement of ACT adult correctional centres and correctional services initially, and within two years youth justice facilities and services. The Act notes that this continuous improvement is to be achieved in particular, by providing a framework for the systematic review and scrutiny of the correctional centres and services, and independent and transparent reporting. The Inspector of Correctional Services The role of Inspector is a part-time independent statutory officer holder position with a five-year appointment term. The Inspector is appointed by the ACT Executive in accordance with an open and accountable selection process, and reports directly to the Legisl ative Assembly of the ACT. The terms and conditions of appointment are subject to any determination under the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1995 (ACT). Mr Neil McAllister was appointed ACT's Inspector of Correctional Services on 14 March 2018 and is the first holder of the office. Neil has some 30 years' experience in working in correctional oversight in a number of jurisdictions, including in establishing the Victorian Corrections Inspectorate and most recently as an independent consultant on corrections. He also brings significant experience in conducting investigations and reviews of critical incidents. Staffing and resources The permanent staffing establishment of the office during the reporting period was the Inspector (as a part time statutory office holder), a Senior Implementation Adviser (0.8 full time equivalent) and one Administration Officer (0.5 full time equivalent). The Senior Implementation Adviser role was envisaged as a temporary role whilst recruitment for a Deputy Inspector was underway. It is expected that the Deputy Inspector role will be filled on a permanent basis early in the 2018-19 year. Contractors Section 14 of the Act empowers the Inspector to engage a person under a contract to assist in the exercise of any function of the Inspector. Further, section 18(2) of the Act requires the Inspector to, if appropriate and practicable, use staff suitable to the cultural background or vulnerability of any detainee involved in a mater being examined or reviewed. Given the OICS has just two operational staff, the use of contractors will be particularly valuable for OICS to bring in relevant expertise to effectively conduct examinations and reviews. During the reporting period, one expert was engaged to assist in the review of remand at AMC. Each expert contractor will be named in the relevant inspection report. The OICS has established contact with other inspectorates in Western Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania, and looks forward to opportunities to engage with them in the future to draw on their experience and expertise. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 437 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Powers and functions Jurisdiction of the Inspector The Inspector's jurisdiction relates to all ACT 'correctional centres' and 'correctio nal services'. These terms are defined in sections 7 and 8 of the Act, and currently include, for example: the AMC the court cells at the ACT Supreme and Magistrates Court ACT Corrective Services transport vehicles a place where a detainee is directed to work or participate in an activity, and a health facility where a detainee is held there under ACT Corrective Services custody. By December 2019, the jurisdiction of the Inspector will expand to include a place declared to be a detention place, or where a detainee is held in custody, under the Children and Young People Act 2008 (ACT). In the ACT this is currently the Bimberi Youth Justice Centre. Functions of the Inspector The functions of the Inspector of Correctional Services are set out in the Inspector of Correctional Services Act 2017 (ACT). The key functions are: The examination and review of ACT correctional centres and services, and reviewing critical incidents at correctional centres or provision of correctional services The Inspector is required to report to the ACT Legislative Assembly on findings from examination and review of ACT Correctional centres and services within 6 months of completion. The Inspector does not respond to individual complaints but where appropriate may refer complaints to relevant agencies and/or other oversight bodies. Critical incident is defined in the Inspector of Correctional Services Act 2017 (ACT) to include: the death of a person a person's life being endangered an escape from custody a person being taken hostage a riot that results in significant disruption to a centre or serv ice a fire that results in significant property damage an assault or use of force that results in a person being admitted to a hospital, any other incident identified as a critical incident by a relevant minister or relevant director - general. Powers of the Inspector The Inspector has a number of powers under the Act. Broadly, these powers include: the right to enter a correctional centre, including at any time without notice, Justice and Community Safety Directorate 438 Annual Report 2017 -2018 the right to inspect any documents relating to a detainee or the provision of a correctional service, the right to speak to or privately interview a persons at the correctional centre, including detainees with their consent, and the right to require provision of information or documents. Year in review Office establishment During the reporting period, the Inspector established an office at Level 2, 11 Moore Street, Canberra City. This space is located within the ACT Human Rights Commission and is utilised on a fee for service basis. T he Inspector acknowledges the support of the Commissioners and staff at the ACT Human Rights Commission, and their welcoming approach. Approval was granted by the ACT Government for the OICS to have branding exemption from standard ACT government branding. This is important given that the Inspector is a statutory office holder and independent from ACT Government, reporting to the ACT Legislative Assembly. The OICS commenced work building a website and it is anticipated this will be complet ed and 'live' early in the next reporting period. It is envisaged this website will contain all reports and reviews, information on methodology and approach, comparative work in oversight, and a research portal for relevant topics for example, relating to implementation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. In the reporting period, the requisite delegations were made to ensure that OICS staff members have appropriate power to visit correctional centres and services, to inspect records and to talk to detainees and staff in private. As the Act is silent on annual reporting requirements, clarification was sought and received from the Minister for Corrections on annual reporting arrangements. Delegations were also made to ensure appropriate functions under Freedom of Information. The Inspector attended Legislative Assembly Estimates on 26 June 2018. Relationships The OICS regularly communicates with ACT Corrective Services (ACTCS), and liaises closely with relevant staff members when planning and undertaking reviews. The Inspector acknowledges the constructive and collaborative approach of ACTCS in the initial phase of establishing the OICS. The OICS is working with other oversight entities in the ACT including the ACT Human Rights Commission, ACT Ombudsman, Corrections Official Visitors and the Public Trustee and Guardian. This includes attending regular corrections oversight meetings with oversight agencies and civil society; as well as the oversight meeti ng hosted by ACTCS. Building relationships with these stakeholders is important to ensure that the OICS complements the role and functions these groups play in relation to corrections, and will be important in establishing processes for information sharing and referral where appropriate. The OICS is grateful for the insights shared by these oversight entities and their collaborative engagement with OICS in its inception period. The Inspector held initial meetings with key stakeholders including the Moss Review Steering Committee, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, ACT Policing, and a range of other entities including Legal Aid, Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health and Community Services, the CPSU, Prisoner's Aid, ACT C ouncil of Social Services, Women's Centre for Health Matters, and the Australian National University College of Law. Community and civil society groups are key stakeholders for OICS, given their experience working in closed environment and particular expertise Justice and Community Safety Directorate 439 Annual Report 2017 -2018 in relation to groups in detention such Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, persons with a disability, women, children and young people, LGBTIQ persons and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The OICS also attended a number of justice sector forums and conferences in the ACT including the directorate's Disability Justice Seminar, and the University of Canberra JACS Justice Connections 5 Conference. General visits The Inspector and the Senior Implementation Adviser visited the AMC on numerous occasions as well as the Court Transport Unit, as a general familiarisation with correctional centres in the ACT. Review of remand In June 2018 the OICS commenced its first review of a correctional centre or service u nder the Act, undertaking a review of treatment and care of remand detainees at the AMC. This review was ongoing at the end of the reporting period. The review methodology includes gathering information through visits and observations at AMC, talking to AMC management and staff, discussions with detainees including distribution of a self-administered survey of men and women on remand. The review team included the Inspector, the Senior Implementation Adviser, Ms Lee Downes and a contractor with extensive experience in corrective services operational environments, including managing a number of prisons across NSW. As part of this review, the OICS has been pleased to take on a student as part of the ANU Winter Law Internship program. The final year ANU Law Student will be preparing a report on the feasibility of bail hostels in the ACT, to address the numbers of people eligible for bail but were remanded in custody due to lack of suitable accommodation. The remand review is likely to be completed in the second half of 2018 and will be published after tabling in the ACT Legislative Assembly. Critical incidents The Inspector was notified of one event meeting the definition of critical incident during the reporting period. A review of that incident is currently underway and a report will be prepared for the Legislative Assembly. Work was commenced in developing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ACT Corrective Services around notification and reporting of critical incidents. It is anticipated this will be finalised early in the next reporting period and posted on the OICS website. Planning for Healthy Prison Review Under the Act, the Inspector is required to conduct a review of correctional centre or service once every two years. This will be a whole of prison review following the 'healthy prison methodology'. The OICS undertook some initial preparatory work for the first healthy prison review including work developing a baseline survey to be administered to detainees, staff and visitors to gather information to guide the review and to act as a reference point for future reviews. The OICS has engaged a contractor skilled in social science research methods to assist with survey design. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 440 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Work was continued on developing the Inspection Standards for ACT Correctional services, and monitoring framework. The standards will be a detailed document setting out expectations around detention practices and will be available to the public. Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) The Inspector met on separate occasions with the Australian Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Ed Santow and the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Michael Manthorpe to discuss detention oversight in the context of Australia's ratification of the OPCAT. The OICS will monitor developments towards OPCAT implementation with interest. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 441 Annual Report 2017 -2018 ANNEXURE B: SENTENCE ADMINISTRATION BOARD Justice and Community Safety Directorate 442 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Background On 2 June 2006 the Sentence Administration Board (the Board) was established under the Crimes (Sentence Administration) Act 2005 (the CSA Act, s171). The Board's functions in summary are to exercise 'supervisory powers', which mainly involves making decisions about release o n parole and license, and about breaches of parole, license and Intensive Corrections Orders (ICOs), Other powers include: \"on request, to provide advice to a Minister about an offender\" and to \"exercise any other function given to the Board under the Act or any other territory law\" (s172, CSA Act). Following an amendment to the CSA that came into effect on 2 March 2016, the Board's supervisory powers were extended to decide the consequences of sentenced offenders failing to comply with their obligations un der ICOs, and consider the reinstatement of an ICO following its cancellation. Alongside this latter amendment, periodic detention as a sentencing option was repealed and the Board's supervisory powers for periodic detention orders have become redundant ov er time. Membership of the Board The Board consists of a chair, at least one deputy chair and not more than two deputy chairs or eight other members, and the Minister appoints members for a period not exceeding three years (s174 CSA Act). The chair and dep uty chairs are judicial members, who have been \"a legal practitioner for not less than 5 years\" (s174 (8) CSA Act). Membership of the Board during the 2017 -18 financial year was as follows: Table 99 Membership of the Board Chair Ms Laura Beacroft (appointed as Chair 14 May 2017) Mr Michael Chilcott (appointment ended 13 May 2017) Deputy Chair Mr Donald Malcolmson (re -appointed as Deputy Chair 14 May 2017) Members ACT Policing representative: Superintendent, Judicial Operations, bei ng Superintendent Stephen Turnbull (to 9 October 2017) and Mick Calatzis (from 10 October 2017) Ms Deborah Evans (reappointed from 14 May 2017) Ms Janine Bromwich (from 14 May 2017) Mr Peter Hyndal (from 14 May 2017) Mr Philip Moss (from 14 May 2017) Dr Judy Putt (from 14 May 2017) Ms Diane Bray (from 24 November 2017) Dr John Cianchi (from 24 November 2017) When exercising its supervisory powers under the CSA Act, the Board is required to sit in divisions consisting of a judicial member and two non- judici al members. Currently, there are two divisions of the Board each sitting alternate Tuesdays and on additional days where the number of matters and/or timeliness in decision -making requires it. The Board has statutory timeframes in which to deal with certain matters, and as a matter of risk management the Board aims to deal with all matters as promptly as practicable. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 443 Annual Report 2017 -2018 The Board sat on 6279 occasions during the 2017-18 financial year. Of the 62 sittings, five meetings were full Board meetings for training or liaison with the Secretariat or services supporting the Board's work. The Board sat to exercise its supervisory powers on 57 days, which is an increase from previous years Overview of the Board's work The Board has statutory jurisdiction to administer sentences imposed by courts on offenders, as mentioned above. The bulk of the Board's work is considering and deciding on whether to grant parole, managing some offenders more intensively while on parole, and considering and deciding sanctions for breaches of parole and breaches of Intensive Correction Orders (ICOs) (parole and ICOs allow an offender to serve their sentence in the community under supervision). Considering the public interest which includes community safety, within a human rights framework, under pins the work of the Board. The Board observes natural justice in its proceedings and decision- making. During 2017 -18, aspects of the Board's work became subject to the oversight of the Inspectorate of Custodial Services. Once legislated, the proposed Inte grity Commission will have oversight of the Board and individual members. The Board is aware of concerns about the risks of offenders serving their sentences in the community, for e.g. under a parole order. A recent study of public opinion about parole suggest that it is \"misleading to characterise public attitudes as indiscriminately punitive\" - the largest sub- group that emerged from the study thought rehabilitation was appropriate in certain circumstances. However increasing public confidence in the parole and related systems is required 80. This report aims to provide information about the Board's work, as a contribution to supporting confidence in the Board. The work of the Board and similar bodies in other states is vital and complex. Over the past decad e there have been various reviews of parole and community corrections arrangements in Australia, the most recent being a 2016 review of the Queensland parole system 81. A report on the latter review explained that the \"only rationale [for parole] is to keep the community safe from crime\", and parole's purpose is to \"reintegrate the prisoner into the community\" in order \"to decrease the chance that a prisoner will ever reoffend\"82. The latter report noted that \"parole is just a matter of timing; except for those who are sentenced to life imprisonment, every prisoner will have to be released eventually\"83. Reviews of parole and community corrections in Australia and comparable nations emphasise that a quality parole system, supported by quality reintegration services, reduces reoffending. For example, a 2014 evaluation of the effectiveness of parole in NSW studied recidivism of 7,494 offenders released from 2009 to 2010. It concluded that active rehabilitation- focused supervision which targets offenders' criminogen ic need and risk factors (i.e. supervision that is not just targeting compliance with reporting conditions) can reduce recidivism. Offenders who are actively supervised took \"longer to commit a new offence, were less likely to commit a new [serious]...offenc e and committed fewer 79 The SAB can sit for one single matter but mostly sits for a whole day with numerous matters 80 Dr Robin Fitzgerald and others, Australian Public Opinion and Parole, Presentation to Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, 2017 at http://www.bocsar.nsw.gov.au/Pages/Search.aspx?k=par 81 Walter Sofronoff QC, Queensland Parole System Review Final Report, November 2016 82 Walter Sofronoff QC, Queensland Parole System Review Final Report, November 2016, paragraph 3, page 1 83 Walter Sofronoff QC,Queensland Parole System Review Final Report, November 2016, paragraph 3, page 1 Justice and Community Safety Directorate 444 Annual Report 2017 -2018 offences than offenders who were released unconditionally into the community [without supervision]\"84. The Board aims to practice 'therapeutic jurisprudence', which refers to a way of working that promotes acceptance of the Board's dec isions especially by offenders, and to relate to an offender in such a way that it re-enforces their motivation to be successful when doing their sentence in the community. Therapeutic jurisprudence is not at odds with protecting the public interest and community safety; rather it can enable the community corrections system to operate better, and in this way reduce non-compliance and re-offending 85. The various reviews of parole and community corrections arrangements in other states inform discussion about improvements in the ACT. However, it needs to be noted that some of the key problems identified in recent interstate reviews are not present in the ACT. For example, the 2016 review in Queensland, similar to an earlier 2013 review of the parole system in Victoria that is now almost fully implemented 86, recommends use of the LSI - R87. The latter is a risk assessment tool that has been used in the ACT system for some time88. In the ACT, the Board makes its decisions informed by the results of such risk tools, along with assessments of community corrections officers, expert reports about an offender's progress in offence -specific programs, other information including from prior court proceedings, and with input from the offender and where available also input from victim/s. The Board is continuously working to improve its contribution to community safety and reducing recidivism. For example, during 2017-18 the Board worked with the Secretariat to speed up time for alleged breaches to be first heard by the Board, in order to limit potential risks of non- compliance or re-offending by offenders in the time period up to the first hearing. The Board can and does require management hearings for offenders who pose special risks, even if there are no breaches before the Board. Board members participate in training, for e.g. during the reporting year experts provided training on managing risks of recidivism by sex offenders. The Board participates in discussions with key providers of services to offenders to better understand how they can support the Board in its work, for e.g. during the 2017-18 reporting year services linked to family violence offenders, and housing for offenders, met with the full Board. Currently the Board cannot report on the specific recidivism rate for persons subject to parole or an ICO in the ACT. However, the Productivity Commission reports on 'completion rates', defined as \"the percentage of community corrections orders completed in a year that were not breached for failure to meet the order requirem ents or because further offences were committed\". In the Productivity Commission's most recent report on 2016 -2017 results, in the ACT the completion rate for all community corrections orders was 70.3% (i.e. orders where the offender is serving their sentence in the community rather than in custody and includes orders supervised by the Board). The completion rate for orders involving supervision was better, 71.2%. The ACT completion rates compare with a national average in 2016-2017 for all orders of 72.2%, and for supervised orders of 70%. This data suggests that supervised orders as compared to non-supervised orders result in higher completion rates in the ACT, which is in line with the study of NSW parole outcomes mentioned earlier. In 2016- 84 Wai- Yin Wan, Suz anne Poynton, Gerard Van Doorn and Don Weatherburn, Parole Supervision and Reoffending, Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice No 485, 2014, page 6 85 David B Wexler, \"New Wine in New Bottles: The Need to Sketch a Therapeutic Jurisprudence Code of Proposed Criminal Processes and Practices\", (2014) 7 Arizona Summit Law Review 463; Michael King, \"Therapeutic Dimension of Judging: The Example of Judging\", (2006) 16 Journal of Judicial Administration 92 86 Ian Callinan AC, Review of the Parole System in Victoria, 2013 87 Walter Sofronoff QC, Queensland Parole System Review Final Report, November 2016, paragraph 567, page 113 88 ACT Auditor-General, Report on the Rehabilitation of Male Detainees at the Alexander Maconochie Centre, Report No 2/ 2015, Appendix A Justice and Community Safety Directorate 445 Annual Report 2017 -2018 2017, Aborigin al and Torres Strait Islander persons in the ACT had a significantly lower completion rate (56.1% compared to non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons 72.6%), and men in the ACT had a slightly lower completion rate than women (70.1% compared to 71 .2%)89. The number of persons in custody is increasing in the ACT similar to national trends, and a flow- on is that the number in some areas of the Board's work is also increasing, for e.g. numbers of persons on parole and/or ICOs. In 2016-2017, in the ACT the average daily population subject to a community corrections order i.e. the offender is in the community, was 1036, with the vast majority of these on supervision orders, 1006 - this is an increase from the prior 2 years 90. Of those on community correcti ons orders, in 2016-2017 19% were female and 16.3% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. At 30 June 2018, in the ACT there were 170 persons subject to parole, an ICO or periodic detention being supervised by the Board, compared to 145 in 2017, and 13 8 in 2016. A key opportunity in the forward years is improving its system for monitoring, reviewing and reporting about the exercise of its supervisory functions, as the Corrective Services Information Management Solution (CSIMS) Project is rolled out. During the reporting year I continued as Chair of the Board, having been appointed for three years on 14 May 2017, after being a member of the Board since 26 January 2014. I am an experienced criminal and administrative lawyer, experienced manager, and an author and researcher in related disciplines. Mr Don Malcolmson continued as the Deputy Chair, having been appointed for three years on 14 May 2017. Mr Malcolmson is also an experienced criminal and administrative lawyer, in private practice in the ACT. Other members are from diverse backgrounds, having been appointed for three years in 2017: Ms Janine Bromwich, Mr Peter Hyndal, Mr Philip Moss AM, Dr Judy Putt and Ms Deborah Evans. Ms Diane Bray and Dr John Cianchi were appointed as members on 24 November 2017 to 13 May 2020, and bring significant skills and experience to the Board's work. Ms Bray is the ACT's 2018 Citizen of the Year, and I acknowledge the special contribution she is making to the work of the Board. Superintendent Mick Calatzis became a member of the Board from 10 October 2017 to 13 May 2020, by virtue of the appointment of the Superintendent Judicial Operations, ACT Police, to the Board. This latter appointment replaced Superintendent Stephen Turnbull. I would like to thank Superintendent Turnbull for his exceptional contribution to the work of the Board over his term. The members of the Board are subject to statutory duties (s177 CSA Act). During 2017/18 the Board developed a Conflict of Interest/Bias Policy to further guide our work, especial ly compliance with the principles of natural justice - the Policy will be published and implemented in 2018- 2019. The Board is a member of the Council of Australasian Tribunals, and where relevant is guided by the Practice Manual for Tribunals (4 th ed). The Board's decisions are subject to review by the ACT Supreme Court. During the reporting period a judgement relating to a Board decision in 2009 was delivered ( Lewis v ACT [2018] ACTSC 19), which awarded damages of $1 to an offender who had not been accorded procedural fairness by the then Board. One new review of a decision was initiated. I, and the deputy Chair, Don Malcolmson, participated in various law reform projects over the reporting period. Most significantly, we have provided input into the proposed amendments to the restorative justice regime ( Crimes (Restorative Justice) Amendment Bill 2018) and development of a 89 Figure 8.13 and Table 8A.19 'Completion of Community Corrections Orders', Report on Government Services 2018, Productivity Commission 90 Figure 8.3, Table 8A.8, 'Community Corrections Offender Population', Report on Government Services 2018, Productivity Commission Justice and Community Safety Directorate 446 Annual Report 2017 -2018 charter of rights for victims of crime ( Charter of Rights for Victims of Crime Options Pa per, JACS, 2018). The Board's work is ably supported by the staff of the Sentence Administration Board Secretariat. On behalf of the Board, I sincerely thank all staff who are or have been involved with the Secretariat for their quality and conscientious support. During the 2017 -18 financial year, the Board considered 1365 matters, see Table 1 below. Note, the count of matters is not a count of distinct offender cases but a count of matters before the Board, even if the matter is an adjourned offender's matter from a previous Board meeting or if the one offender returns to the Board with multiple matters. The number of matters before the Board decreased compared to the previous reporting year (1403 and 1939 in 2016- 17 an d 2015 -16 respectably). This change is largely driven by the dropping away of high numbers of periodic detention breach matters to 1, and the slow rise of ICO breaches to 134 as more offenders are sentenced to this relatively new sentence option. Parole matters have decreased slightly compared to 2016 -17 (1210 compared to 1279 and 1056 in 2016 -17 and 2016 -15 respectively). This reflects a decrease in both parole applications (172 applications compared with 192 and 194 in 2016-17 and 2015 -16 respectively), and also breach of parole matters (147 compared with 191 and 168 in in 2016/17 and 2015 -16 respectively). Table 100 Total matters considered by the Board 2017 -18 2015 -16 2016 -17 2017 -18 Periodic detention 883 46 1 Parole 1056 1279 1210 License 0 0 0 Intensive Corrections Order 78 154 Total 1939 1403 1365 Of the total parole application outcomes, 61.7% resulted in parole being granted (compared to 62.2% and 58.8% in 2016 -17 and in 2015 -16 respectively), see Figure 1. In short, the majority of parole applications are granted as in previous years. Note, conditions of parole orders vary and are tailored to an offender's and victim's circumstances. Justice and Community Safety Directorate 447 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 71 Outcomes of Parole Applications 2017- 18 Breaches of ICOs and of parole are complex given the profile of offenders who are subject to these orders. Their complexity requires the Board to take care in obtaining and considering relevant evidence even if this requires adjournments. Therefore, while breach matters have decreased in number, the hearings associated with such matters has increased (586 total hearings which includes 355 for breach matters, compared to 523 total hearings with 273 of these for breach matters in 2015 -16, and 467 total hearings with 296 of these for breach matters, in 2015- 16). Compared to previous years, in 2017-18 a much higher proportion of outcomes from parole breach matters resulted in a formal warning (60.2% compared to 42.9% and 36.9% in 2016- 17 and 2015 -16 respectively). In 2 017-18 there was a slightly higher proportion of parole breach matters where orders were cancelled (31.7% compared to 28.7% and 27.6% in 2016- 17 and in 2015 -2016 respectively). See figure before. Periodic detention matters were significantly reduced to onl y 1 matter and 1 hearing, due to the repeal of related legislation and closure of the centre. Supervision of the new ICOs resulted in 134 breach matters (compared to 77 and 1 in 2016 -17 and 2015 -16 respectively). The majority of these ICO breach matters resulted in a formal warning, a much higher proportion than previously (73.4% compared to 58.5% in 2016/17), 16.5% resulted in a 3 day suspension, 4.6% resulted in a 7 day suspension to be served by full- time imprisonment (compared to 18.5% in 2016 -17), 5.5% resulted in cancellation of the ICO (compared to 6.1% in 2016/17). Justice and Community Safety Directorate 448 Annual Report 2017 -2018 Figure 72 Outcomes for breach of parole matters for 2017-18 and outcomes for breach of ICO matters for 2017 -18 The Board respects the rights, interests and concerns of victims in Board proceedings, consistent with its legislative framework. As mentioned earlier, as the Chair of the Board I actively participated in consultation about the development of a charter of rights for victims of crime ( Charter of Rights for Victims of Crime Options Paper , JACS, 2018). The CSA Act already has important legislative provisions that offer support and a voice for registered victims in Board proceedings. The Victim Liaison Officer within ACTCS assists the Board in performing its functions under Chapters 7 and 13 of the CSA Act by establishing contact with registered victims of offenders being considered for release to parole, licence or for an ICO reinstatement. Registered victims are also notified of breach proceedings resulting in cancellation or suspension of an order, and changes to the offender's sentence for ICO, parole and license matters. The Victim Liaison Officer informs victims of the role of the Board, ensures that registere d victims are advised of matters relating to the offender's possible release from custody and provides victims with assistance in the preparation of written submissions. The CSA Act provides registered victims with an opportunity to express any concerns they, or their family, have regarding an offender's possible release from custody; the submissions may be secured i.e. confidential to the Board. The CSA Act allows a person to provide a submission to the Board on behalf of a victim. Providing a submission to the Board is voluntary.
