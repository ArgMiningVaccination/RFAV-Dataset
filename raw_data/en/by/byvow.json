Pam Har-rison says the rising popularity has been driven by German patients, who began de-manding herbal alternatives to synthetic drugs. Medical schools responded byreintroducing lessons on a topic that had been phased out of the medical curriculum.

If you're a German GP who diagnoses mild to moderate depression these days, chances are good your patients will be treated with St. John's wort, nota synthetic antidepressant product. German doctors prescribed almost 66 million daily doses of drugs containing St. John's wort \u2014 Hypericum perforatum \u2014 in 1994, and that number has undoubtedly risen since then. The expenditure, inCanadian dollars, was roughly $55 million. The popularity of drugs such as St. John's wort is one reason for burgeoning growth in the use of phytopharmaceuticals in Europe, where sales now stand atan estimated $6 billion annually, including at least $2 billion in Germany; an-nual sales in Canada total less than $200 million. \"I'd say close to 80% of Ger-man physicians regularly employ plant medications,\" Dr. Joerg Gruenwald ofBerlin's Institute for Phytopharmaceuticals said in an interview. The cost of about 40% of the herbal remedies currently prescribed by Ger- man physicians are covered by the health care system \u2014 a not inconsequentialreason for their historically high acceptance among the country's physicians andpatients. Behind this acceptance there also appears to lie a conviction that there islittle to choose between drugs derived from plant sources and those producedsynthetically. \"The tradition of physicians using herbs not only as foods but as active ther- apy has long roots in our history,\" says Dr. Wolf-Dietrich H\u00fcbner, clinical re-search director at Lichtwer Pharma in Berlin. \"Herbal remedies were widelyused by professionals until the rise of synthetic drugs in this century.\" However, even with their rise the gentler botanical arts did not die out entirely as they did in North America: they were kept alive by pharmacists who continuedto sell products derived from plants. T en to 15 years ago, German patients begandemanding alternatives to synthetic drugs and the country's medical schools soonfelt compelled to reintroduce the phased-out topic of phytopharmacology. Thismeant that new physicians now had at least some exposure to complementarymedicine.

CMAJ 1998;158:637-9 CMAJ MAR. 10, 1998; 158 (5) 637 \u00a9 1998 Pam HarrisonDr. Christel Schr\u00f6ter: patients fed up with synthetic drugs? which comprises 4 weeks' instruction in herbal and other complementary medical practices. This is followed by a 3-month internship with a doctor of naturopathy. Herbal medicines themselves are treated differently in Germany than in Canada. There, a herbal medicinemust also be registered with the German equivalent ofCanada's Health Protection Branch (HPB) before it isaccepted as a therapeutic drug. Acceptance of these \"new\" drugs in Germany became more formalized in the 1980s after a commission surveyedall safety and efficacy data involving herbal products beingused as medicines. Based on the commission's evaluation ofthese data, more than 200 plant-product monographs weredeveloped, which allow manufacturers to market productsaccording to indications stated in the monographs. Health insurance companies generally pay for the drugs. These moves have meant that German physicians have more confidence that the herbal medicines theyprescribe are, indeed, therapeutically active and canserve as appropriate alternatives to synthetic drugs whentreating milder or more chronic forms of disease. Dr. Hans Joachim Rudolph, a Berlin-based internist and doctor of naturopathy, is confident that his holistic approach to patients' problems \u2014 part of which includesplant medicines \u2014 does work. Rudolph, who was trainedin medical school when the principles of phytopharmacol-ogy, if taught at all, were soon forgotten, spent severalyears working in a hospital-based practice before decidingto pursue his growing interest in naturopathy.When he did this, he also took a turn teaching the theory and application of phytopharmacology to medicalstudents in Berlin. In one class students were taught theappropriate course of natural therapies for patients beingtreated in a special 80-bed hospital teaching unit. \"Aslong as the disease being treated is not very severe, thereis no doubt that these herbal drugs have therapeutic ef-fects and they are less toxic for patients than syntheticdrugs,\" says Rudolph. One of his most important lessons has been that the use of natural therapies such as plant medicines creates agood rapport between physician and patient. \"At certainacute stages of a disease we cannot expect too much fromthese plants,\" Rudolph stresses. \"But when the disease isless active or in its chronic stages, herbal medicines can bevery helpful and the results can be quite wonderful.\" \"It always depends on the severity of the disease,\" agrees Dr. Christel Schr\u00f6ter, a Berlin general practi-tioner, \"but I like to start treatment with a plant medi-cine because many kinds of illnesses and diseases can becured with these drugs.\" In Germany, the key indicators for their use in pri- mary care practices are colds, bronchial infections andcoughs. Plant medicines are also commonly prescribedfor irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disturbances, anxietyand depression. \"Many people come to me becausethey're fed up with synthetic drugs and they want some-thing that is more natural,\" explains Schr\u00f6ter. Plant medicines are also safe to use in the treatment Harrison 638 JAMC 10 MARS 1998; 158 (5)Because much of the research concerning herbal medicines is published in languages other than English,most North American physicians have heard littleabout the scientific evidence outlining the therapeuticefficacy of these products. \"But,\" says Dr. Edzard Ernst,chair of the Department of Complementary Medicineat the Postgraduate Medical School, University of Ex-eter, \"randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlledclinical trials for herbal remedies exist, and these arethe data we should accept.\" Some of the evidence is now finding its way into re- spected, world-class journals. Last year JAMA reported thatGinkgo biloba , which is widely used in Germany to treat dementia-type syndromes and symptoms of for-getfulness and poor concentration, had led to improve-ment in patients with Alzheimer's disease ( JAMA 1997;278:1327-32). The study determined that patientsshowed clinically meaningful improvement in cogni-tive functioning after taking the product for a year. Thestudy is considered one of the first to evaluate a herbal remedy scientifically. St. John's wort has also received significant scientific scrutiny. According to a meta-analysis of 15 placebo-controlled trials published in the BMJ, patients with mild to moderate depression taking this herbal remedy were2.7 times more likely to improve relative to placebo(BMJ 1996;313:253-4). Symptoms typically improve af- ter 2 to 4 weeks of treatment, and there are no sedatingside effects. Improvements in sleep disturbances havealso been shown to accompany improvements in mood. Garlic, which has also been touted for its beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, received peer-reviewed support last year when Circulation reported that \"data strongly support the hypothesis that garlic in-take had a protective effect on the elastic properties ofthe aorta related to aging in humans\" ( Circulation 1997;96:2649-55). It was the first study involving phy-tomedicine to appear in that journal.Plant medicines gain some peer-reviewed respectof some common childhood ailments; patient acceptance appears to be better than is generally reported for pa-tients taking synthetic drugs. \"The problem is not that herbal products aren't bio- logically active, because they are,\" says Ken Planta Dei Pharma, aCanadian company based in NewBrunswick. Rather, the problem is toensure that any therapeutic claim ac-companying a plant product is justi-fied not only by scientific evidencebut also by quality control. In Ger-many, issues surrounding qualitycontrol and standardization of herbalproducts are less of a concern than inCanada because ethical botanicalmanufacturers use the same high-quality production standards foundin the synthetic-drug industry. \"Over the past 10 to 15 years we've been able to spend money ongood clinical research that, at leastthe way we do it, is identical to thetype of research carried out in thedevelopment of synthetic drugs,\"says Lichtwer Pharma's H\u00fcbner.This means that in Germany, prod-ucts from botanical companies contain what their labelsstate and the efficacy for treating certain conditions hasbeen validated in scientific studies. With a few exceptions, the same can't be said forCanada. Here, says Dr. Frank Chandler, director of the College of Pharmacy at Dalhousie University, qualitycontrol is \"a sham.\" Depending on where a plant isgrown and the part used in the final product, consumerscould end up buying a product that contains little if any of the plant in question. \"Herbal medicines can also be mis- labelled, adulterated or contaminated,\"adds Chandler. Health claims regard-ing plant products, which in theory arenot allowed if products are sold as foodsupplements, are at best promotionaland at times fraudulent, he says. As chair of an advisory committee on herbal medicine within Health Canada,Chandler is trying to introduce stan-dardization so that herbal products canbe more reliably integrated into med-ical practice. These efforts will not af-fect the over-the-counter sale of theseproducts to consumers, but Chandlersays that \"if we can get quality productsout to the public, we will have movedthe whole field of herbal medicine for-ward megafold.\" Dr. Brian Hardy, the coordinator of clinical programs in pharmacy at the Sunnybrook Health Science Centre in T oronto, saysthat \"not a week goes by without someone asking meabout some herbal medicine. We need good informationso we can help patients with their decisions.\" \u00df Herbal medicine CMAJ MAR. 10, 1998; 158 (5) 639Dr. Hans Joachim Rudolph: Don't ex- pect much from herbs for acute disease Do you want your Member of Parliamentto get the right messageabout health care?
