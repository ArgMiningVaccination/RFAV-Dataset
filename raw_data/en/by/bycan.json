CJ Grant, from [Perth](/news/perth/index.html), said she tried everything imaginable, including lotions and prescribed medication - to get rid of her bad breakouts but nothing seemed to work. Between her teenage years and her early 20s, CJ said she was so ashamed of her blemishes, she didn't want anyone to see her face or take pictures. But when she was holidaying in [Thailand](/news/thailand/index.html), she discovered an unusual remedy after a local woman at the market urged her to drink the tea to help her stubborn acne. And within days of drinking the tea without knowing what was in the ingredients, CJ claimed she saw dramatic improvements in her skin. Scroll down for video Chef CJ Grant (pictured left with her acne and right with maggots) who suffered severe acne has claimed her skin completely cleared up within two weeks of drinking tea with maggots How does maggots work for skin? Maggot secretion contains an anti-bacterial enzyme, which is so effective in cleaning wounds and slowing bacterial growth. Studies previously suggested maggots might be helpful, potentially offering antibacterial and healing benefits in addition to keeping the wound clean - but not all researchers are convinced insects are the way to go. CJ - who will appear in SBS's upcoming show [Medicine or Myth?](https://www.sbs.com.au/programs/medicine-or-myth) - said she returned to the market with a translator to find out more what exactly was in the tea. From there, she was told the tea included dried, grounded up maggots. 'I was shocked, horrified and disgusted. No one wants to be told that you've been drinking this beautiful tea with bugs in it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But I tried to push through the fact that there's maggots in it, and focus on the fact it was making my face better because nothing else seemed to work. 'This incredible tea has changed my life.' CJ said the hot beverage tastes like 'dirt' and she finds it easier to drink when she mixes grounded maggots with flavoured teas. 'It tastes very earthy, it's very unique that's for sure,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I usually mix the maggots with whatever flavoured tea I like to drink it with. My favourite is peach, or anything fruity. 'I find flavoured teas accentuates the flavour - and masks the flavour of maggots.' CJ - who will appear in SBS's upcoming show Medicine or Myth? - said she found the tea at a market in Thailand - and within two weeks of drinking it, her skin completely cleared up CJ said she sources her own maggots from suppliers, with half a kilo costing her anywhere between $50 to $60. 'I try to buy them live so I can make sure they don't have any nasties in their tummy. I also feed them myself, usually with carrion meat so they're cleaned out.' Next she dehydrates them in the oven before grounding them up. She adds the grounded up maggots to the flavoured tea and then adds boiling water. Despite her skin being completely cleared now, CJ admitted she still drinks the tea when feels a little pain coming on. 'Every now and then, I'd feel a breakout coming so I'd just have a cup of tea, and it just stops it down its tracks. It's fantastic,' she said. 'I probably drink it once every few months. It really helps prevent any acne from coming.' CJ said she has received mixed responses from her family and friends. 'I didn't tell my mum I had live maggots in the house but when she found out, she was pretty angry. My friends think it's hilarious,' CJ said. CJ said she buys live maggots from a supplier, and then dehydrates them in an oven. Once dried, she grounds them up and then adds it to her favourite tea leaves CJ said the hot beverage tastes like 'dirt' and she finds it easier to drink when she mixes grounded maggots with flavoured teas Three years ago, CJ said a local woman at a market in Thailand approached her before advising her to drink the tea leaves to help her acne. 'At this point, I was ready to try anything,' CJ told a panel of medical experts, led by renowned Australian neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo. 'So it wasn't until a week later that I'd been drinking this tea every day, and my acne just cleared up. I thought the only thing I've done different is drink this tea. 'By the end of the two weeks, my acne was gone and my skin was clear.' She now swears by the tea for changing her life. 'It's very controversial... It's not for the faint hearted but trust me, it works,' CJ said. Dr Charlie Teo (pictured) said he was very intrigued by the remedy, saying he grew up suffering from severe acne so he would have considered trying the maggot tea himself Dr Teo said he was very intrigued by the remedy, saying he grew up suffering from severe acne so he would have considered trying the maggot tea himself. 'Acne is such a terrible problem, it afflicts so many people,' Dr Teo said. 'I had bad acne when I was a child, same as [CJ], I didn't want to socialise, I wanted to hide my face. It was terrible. If someone said to me \"all you've got to do is dry up some maggots, and drink them, I would've done it immediately.' Despite Dr Teo expressing his interests, the panel said the trial could never work because it would be very difficult to convince people to stomach maggots. 'I do appreciate it. It's very difficult to run a trial but I think what you've done is underscore the importance of looking for an alternative treatments for something that is as bad as acne, [you're] very brave,' Dr Teo said to CJ.
