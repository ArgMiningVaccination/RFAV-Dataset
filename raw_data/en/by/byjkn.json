We explore all aspects of lifestyle and focus on a partnership between patient and practitioner that combines all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative. We recognize that good medicine should be based in good science, be inquiry driven, and be open to new paradigms. We use natural, effective, less-invasive interventions whenever possible and focus on the promotion of health and the prevention of illness as in addition to the treatment of disease. Homeopathy Founded in the late 1700's, Homeopathy is the belief that the substances that cause disease in healthy people can cure the disease/symptoms in sick people. The center will prepare custom homeopathic formulations based on the individual diagnoses and ailments.

As an all-natural alternative medicine, aromatherapy uses essential oils taken from flowers, peels of plants, leaves, stems, bark, seeds, and roots.
