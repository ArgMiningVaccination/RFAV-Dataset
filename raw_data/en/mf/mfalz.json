The only authority for the statement is Athenaeus (i. p. 12), on whom no reliance can be placed. But the reading is in itself vigorous and poetical. In fact the metaphor is so natural that we cannot even argue with confidence that Aischylos had dai=ta before him when real variant is much older than Zen. The argument against it in Athenaeus (often ascribed, though without ground, to Ar.), that H. never uses dai/s except of human banquets, is not even based on fact, see dai=ta seems intrinsically a better reading, but we have no right to leave the uniform tradition of the MSS. a)/eide in the first line, 'take up the song from the point when,' as d' a)oidh/n, was explained to mean 'on account woman' (!) t' a)/r, as ga/r from g' a)/r. It does not of course make any perceptible difference here if we write t' a)/r (with MSS. except A); but see cune/hke, 'pitted them in strife.' sfw=i+, which Ar. confined to the 2nd person. It is, however, possible that the distinction is a mere fiction. Cf. Both a)tima/w and a)tima/zw occur in our texts, but the aor. is elsewhere only h)ti/mhsen, and a)tima/zw is peculiar to the h)ti/mhs'.

For the article in Killa is placed by Strabo on the gulf of Adramytteion, near Thebe. The historical Chryse was on the west coast of the Troad, though others, hard put to it to explain why Chryseis was captured of several places named Sminthia, as far as Rhodes. The Sminthian temple near Cape Lekton existed to historical times; and even on late coins of Alexandria Troas Apollo appears with a mouse at his feet. Mr. Lang argues that this indicates the amalgamation of the Greek Apollo with a local mouse-god, originally a tribal totem. The common explanation is that the word is a familiar abbreviation of *sminqofqo/ros, destroying the field-mice or voles 460.] For the form ti/saien, probably read here by Ar., see note on [24.38]. au)to\\s e)/fa. We should have expected the word to imply an opposition to some other person as in 51; merely to contrast the god with the arrows seems weak. It was probably this which induced Zen., followed by Bentley and Bekker, to athetize this and the preceding line; but the couplet is too fine to be sacrificed. [10.487]. The position of peuk- is doubtless conn. with Lat. peripeuke/s peukedano/s The rhythm of this line is very strange; the connexion of the preposition with its case is so close as hardly to admit a caesura; but there is no other in the third or fourth foot, cf. e)/pos e)re/w kai\\ e)pi\\ fresi\\ qumw=i, sth/qessi), which shows that e)pi\\ fresi/ is to be taken in a locative sense. Note the variant o(rh=to ( o(/rhto) ascribed to Zen., and compare o(/rhai -h- with the Ionic colouring of our present text; o(/rato would be the old non-thematic form, but o(ra=to is more probably due to Attic influence than to a survival from a prae-Ionic text. oi(/ me me/ga pla/zousi. The MSS. write palimplagxqe/ntas in one word, which is so far right, as it indicates that pa/lin is to be taken in a purely local sense. There is an old and wrong explanation, that pa/lin means 'once again,' and contains an allusion to the legend, unknown to Homer, of a previous expedition against Troy in which the Greeks had lost their way, and invaded Mysia by mistake.

It will be observed that the rams and goats seem to represent the 'hecatomb,' which here does not consist of 100 or of any oxen. It may indeed be doubted if the -bh represents bou=s at all. (Platt explains the word as 'one hundredth of the oxen' a man has; but even that does not suit this place.) ai)/ ken must be subj., and is therefore an erroneous form, as the subj. of thematic verbstems must have the long vowel ( bou/lht'with P.

The choice lies between (3) and (4), of which the former seems preferable. The epithet well expresses a vivacious keen spirit, such as the Greeks were conscious of possessing; while, as applied to a woman, it will imply eagerness and youthful brightness. It is therefore needless to look beyond the familiar sense of velik- for an interpretation. e(likoble/faron *)afrodi/thn The phrase recurs kradi/h po/rfure. This (Autenrieth's) explanation seems much superior to the ordinary interpretation of a)mfime/lainaias 'lying in the midmost darkness of the body,' which is hardly Homeric either in thought or expression; but the com pound may be explained as proleptic, 'so as to become darkened all about' e.g. v of vei=pas, and the lengthening of to/ by position in the fourth thesis. Furthermore, to\\ krh/guon in the sense ta\\ kaka/ in the next line, ta\\ krh/gua is but a partial remedy, and there seems to be some grave corruption. As we know nothing of the origin of krh/guon, the u may, for all we can tell, have been long; we could then read ou)/ pw/ pote/ moi krh/guon e)/eipas, and the MS. variants may point to something of the sort.

Zoilos, the famous *(omhroma/stic, accused Homer of solecism in this line for using a plural verb instead of a singular; he must therefore have read dw=si, which was probably indeed the original form of the 3rd sing. subj., answering to * dw/hisi: see dw/hisi *troi/hn. a)gaqo/s), be content with that, and do not attempt to outdo me in Three ways of translating this line have been proposed.

Both (a) and (b) give a good sense, (a) referring to the distance of time at which the recompense is to be made (128), (b) to Achilles' refusal to accord the restitution at all.

Bayfield ingeniously suggests that a)/rsantes kata\\ qumo/n is itself the verb dido/ntwn being supplied from the protasis, dw/sousi (123). Note that there is no appreciable difference between ei) with fut. ind. and ei)/ ke with aor. subj. There is some doubt as to the punctuation here, some putting a colon after e(/lwmai, but this makes the repetition of the participles i)w\\n .. e(lw/n very awkward. That given in the text is unobjectionable. 139 was rejected by Ar. as superfluous and eu)/hqes. This athetesis is accepted by those who would banish ke with the fut. ind. from the text of Homer; but the grounds given by Ar. are not convincing, and the omission of the line would damage the effect. boulh/ on the insufficient ground that metacu/ does not recur in H. skio/wnta, which in spite of the authority of Ar. is indefensible, is explained by Fick as due to a primitive *s*k*i*o*n*t*a, which could be interpreted either as skiou=nta = skio/enta or skiw=nta = skio/wnta. e(spo/meqa is still hence also the present participle a)rnu/menoi follows. *tr. ptoli/eqron of Troy, possibly mean ou)x e(/cw, and 166 ff. obviously refer to repeated experience in the past. ei), the contraction of ei) a)/n not thing, but mine own.' fi/los here indeed is little removed from its apparently original sense 'own.'

The sentence, like the 'two-sided' similes (see on [12.151]), buds out into new relations while it is being uttered. It is possible, but more prosaic, to leave min. per e)o/nta out of sight altogether as a mere parenthesis, and take e)/tekes as involving the claim, the divinity of his mother being understood: 'since you, a goddess, bore me, the gods should have dealt better by me.' w)/feile, not to be confused with the quite distinct o)fe/llw = [6.350]. a)po/-vra-s, root ver, short form vra (= vr); the long form is found in a)po/-verse, etc., The a(/lios ge/rwn is known to later mythology as Nereus, but is never named in Homer.

The scholiasts give two curious legends about Thersites: one that having been Homer's guardian, and in that capacity robbed him of his inheritance, he is thus caricatured in immortal revenge; the other that he had been crippled by Meleagros, who threw him down a precipice because he skulked in the chase of the boar of Kalydon.

There is no doubt that the temporal grew out of the local sense, through the idea of 'going back again' to a former state of things; and it is better to recognise in such phrases as this instances of the transitional use than to attempt to force an arbitrary rule on Homer. So pa/lin poi/hse ge/ronta. may be ironical, as it is generally a word of praise; but as applied to Achilles is perhaps inserted to prevent hiatus; which is probably allowable at the end of the first foot (see on 87), without the necessity of taking oi( for the pron. voi, with Nauck.

The only question is whether we should simply replace 435-40 after 361, omitting the formal 434 and making some little alteration in 441, so that it may follow directly on 432, or whether 362-433 are not an interpolation altogether.

The site of Nestor's Pylos was disputed from the earliest days between three cities of the name in W. Peloponnesos, one in Elis, one in Messenia (the modern Old Navarino), and one between the two in Triphylia. The present passage, and the localities named in Nestor's narrative, h)maqo/eis implies a situation on the sea-shore, while both the Elean and Triphylian towns were in hilly places. So again the legends of the migration of the Minyan Neleus from Thessaly all take him to Triphylia; yet Pindar speaks of him as *messa/nios ge/rwn, and the Messenian site was clearly that generally accepted by the fifth century. It is natural to suppose that, so far as the legends may have a historical basis, the Triphylian Pylos was originally the home of Nestor, but that, in consequence perhaps of the Aitolian invasion, which took place in the W. Peloponnesos about the same time as the Dorian in the E. and supplanted the Epeians by the later Eleians, the Neleid clan were driven southward out of Triphylia, and took with them their legends and local names to a new home in Messenia. Some hypothesis of the sort seems required to account for the frequency of duplicate names in the region. The Homeric poems then contain traces of both the older and newer state of things. See M. and R. on *ai)pu/(Aipeia) iii. 448, Kyparisse\u00efs iii. 462, Helos iii. 380, Dorion iii. 445, Oichalia iii. 408. *qruo/essa po/lis of It will be noticed that the *dw/tion, the Dotian plain, a name which bears a curious resemblance to *dw/rion.

But, apart from the fact that Homer knows nothing of wandering minstrels, and tells us only of bards attached to a particular chieftain's court, there is clear evidence that the Oichalia legend, which played an important part in the later Epos, was localized in Peloponnesos as well as in Thessaly; see *oi)xali/as *(/alwsisattributed to Kreophylos, [18.191].

But this line, according to a scholion on Pindar, was obelized. There is no mention of this in Schol. A, where we find, however, that Ar. obelized the preceding line, taking fi/lhqen to mean 'they were friendly to one another in spite of the tribal division,' and regarding 669 as inserted in order to give another explanation of fi/lhqen: the line with its obvious padding certainly bears out the idea. Nireus is not mentioned again. The double epanalepsis is unique in H. For These are small islands among the Sporades, only Kos having attained any subsequent importance; the Cyclades are not mentioned at all. Pheidippos and Antiphos again are named only here; the mention of their Herakleid descent looks as if these lines came from the same source as the Rhodian episode above. All the islands were Dorian colonies, but Kos at least had legends of colonization from Thessaly, whence Thessalos is brought into the genealogy. This is again an anachronism, as the Thessalian name is elsewhere ignored in H. It is hardly possible to read this and the two following lines without feeling that originally Achilles was the leader of the whole of the Thessalians, and that his restriction to three paltry towns in 682 is merely a device to make room for the localization of other Thessalian heroes. As it stands, the effect is almost like 'all the peoples of Britain, who dwelt in Greenwich and Woolwich and Blackheath, and were named Saxons and English and Danes.' The Pelasgian Argos, properly the central plain of Thessaly about Larissa, a long way from Phthia, is in the sequel stretched to comprise Thessaly in the widest sense, and even Dodona in Aitolia. There can be little doubt that Hellenes, Myrmidons, and Achaians were originally three distinct tribal names of Thessaly, all under the suzerainty of Achilles, as the South was under the suzerainty of Agamemnon. In *pane/llhnes. The introductory words e)/speteor e)re/w. These towns are all in the extreme south of Thessaly, round the head of the Malian gulf, in the same district as that assigned to Protesilaos (695 ff.).

In 726 they come naturally, as two lost chieftains have already been mentioned. The line is simply copied here from 726. 708-9 look like a gloss intended to explain the apparently ambiguous o(, and filled up from previous lines so as to make two hexameters. The towns following (711-5) lie N. and (716-7) E. of the head of the Pagasaean Gulf. Sophokles evidently follows this h)de/, perhaps rightly; but see note on [6.478]. There is now a jump from the SE. to the W. of Thessaly, whence came the cultus of Asklepios, which in historical times had its chief seat in Epidauros, though the temple at Trikka was always famous. (The oldest myth takes us to Lakereia on the Boibeian lake, which we have just left, 711.) Homer does not represent him as anything more than a mortal chieftain, a(/p. reading are alike uncertain. klimako/essan might perhaps be used of terraced hill-sides, like staircases. For Oichalia and Eurytos see on 595. *)asklhpio/o, see on 518. 734-5. We make another jump back to Magnesia, this group of towns being among those assigned to note on [6.457]. For We now go to the N. of Central Thessaly, the home of the Lapiths ( *fh=res who are driven out. 741 is a very clumsy line as the text stands; 742-4 seem meant to supplant, not to follow, 741, and to bring in the later myth of the Centaurs and Lapiths, of which Athens made so much.

One Demokrines actually read *ai)qio/pessi, No Peraibian towns in Thessaly are mentioned, as they have been already given to the Lapiths. The explanation of Strabo is that these Peraibians are a portion of the tribe who had been driven out of their old homes in the plain, and lived scattered among the mountains, while the bulk of the tribe lived mixed up with the Lapiths. If this is meant, it would seem that some of them must have crossed into Aitolia, for there can be no question that it is the Aitolian Dodona which is named; though, on the other hand, it is hard to escape the suspicion that the poet of this passage supposed it to lie in Thessaly. The Thessalian Achilles prays to the Pelasgian Zeus of Dodona in *titarhsso/n is most tempting, because of ve/rga, and of the analogy of other place-names in -hsso/s: cf. Lucan vi. 376 Defendit Titaressos aquas. But unfortunately it contravenes the rule that lengthening by position of a vowel short by nature is not permitted before the bucolic diaeresis. What idea the poet had in his mind about the meeting of the rivers it is hard to say. It is said that the Europos is a clear stream which is easily to be distinguished for some distance after it has joined the Peneios white with make a jump back to the E.; and again we have a tribe, the Magnetes, without any cities, as the towns of Magnesia have been already enumerated and apportioned among various chiefs, Philoktetes, Eumelos, and Eurypylos. And here no theory of a separation of the tribe will help us, as these Magnetes are expressly located about Pelion and the Peneios, the very country that we have already been through. Strabo fairly gives up the puzzle is a mere admission of the impossibility of any historical criticism of this part of the Catalogue. The ships enumerated amount to 1186. *nhlh/i+ai i(/ppoi of Nestor, o)- same as in o)/patros, a(- (for o)ga/stwr: by o(mo/s by oi)ete/as presumably represents only the lengthening oi)vos = stafulh/, a bunch to be merely an itacistic variant; though Byz. Steph. and Hesychios mention a town of that name in Thessaly, nothing more is known of it, and it is probably only a deduction from this line, supported by the fact that the position of Pieria is clearly too far north. Besides, the horses were evidently bred by Apollo during his service with Admetos at Pherai. Hence Valckenaer conj. *fhrei/hi, which has a shade of MS. support, and would be satisfactory but for the fact that the Thessalian town is *ferai/ (711), *fh=rai being in Messenia. But the patronymic *fhrhtia/dhs points to some variation of quantity, as it is evidently connected with the name of the town. [5.272] mh/stwre (?) fo/boio.

The gate of the king's palace has always been the place of justice and of audience among eastern nations; a familiar example is the 'Sublime Porte.' 791-5 were obelized by Ar. on good grounds: 'if the advance of the Greeks was all that had to be announced, there was no need of the goddess; but if the Trojans lacked courage and had to be persuaded to advance, the goddess must appear in person. When the gods take human shape, they are wont to leave at their departure some sign by which they may be known. The message is not adapted to the tone of a son speaking to his father, but is intense ( e)pitetame/noi) and reproachful; and the words of 802 do not suit Polites; it is Iris herself who should impose the command.' On the other hand, l. 798 is rather suited to a human warrior than to a goddess. But the whole passage seems forced, and out of place. 804-5 should belong to a description of the first landing of the Greeks (compare the similar advice of Nestor 362-8, and the building of the wall in The tomb of Aisyetes is not again named as a landmark; but other barrows are mentioned in a similar manner, e.g. 811, and the sh=ma *)/ilou potide/gmenos u(pode/gmenos de/xmenos (a an aor. form ( e)de/gmhn) which is plainly the sense oi)=da, e(/ssai, ? i(e/reuto de/gmenositself might be a syncopated present; there is probably no reason for supposing that the affection of xby mis confined to aor. and perfect stems.

But in all the other phrases ( pa=s = o(/los, the emphasis lies on the fact that the whole of something is affected when it might have been only a part; the difficulty here obviously is that we can hardly conceive a pa=sai could at the most mean that both the sani/des were opened, not one only, and then it would obviously be an unnatural phrase. It is better to consider the poet as conceiving Ilios, like all great towns, as many-gated, but as only naming the one gate which was specially recorded by his tradition. The tomb of Myrine, like that of Aisyetes, is not again TROJANS differs notably from that of the Greeks in the evident want of detailed knowledge of the countries with which it deals. Three groups of towns are given, two without any tribal names (828 f., 835 f., 853 f.), all lying along the Hellespont and the south shore of the Euxine. Niese suggests that these may probably be taken from an early form of the Argonautic legend, as they all lie on the course there taken. The rest of the Catalogue contains only names of tribes with occasional mention of a single city. The arrangement of the allies is radial, not concentric, along four lines running NW. (844-50), E. (851-7), SE. (858-63), S. (864-77), the extremity of each line being marked by th=le or thlo/qen. The Trojans and allied tribes form a central group (816-43). There are serious differences from the rest of the *f. In o( ai)o/llwn, o( Dardanians (whence 'Dardanelles') see Cf. These *trw=es are a separate clan who had doubtless split off from the Trojans proper, and settled a short distance away to the NE. See also note on [5.105]. The Aisepos runs into the Sea of Marmora near Kyzikos. These towns lie at the extreme N. of the Troad, where the Hellespont opens out into the Sea of Marmora. Pityeia is possibly the later Lampsakos. Adrasteia was a local goddess = Nemesis, and Adrastos perhaps originally a god identical with the Adrastos of Sikyon (see note on 572). It is certainly curious that he should appear here with Amphios, apparently a short form of Amphiaraos, so closely bound up with Adrastos in the Theban legend. Amphios of Paisos ou)d' for svou/s). Merops seems to have migrated from Perkote (see 835), or rather the name points to some hero-worship common to all the district; cf. As Niese remarks, it is natural that in a peri/plous such as that of the Argonauts Sestos and Abydos, on opposite sides of the Hellespont, should be joined together, but not that in a geographical list they should be put under the same ruler. Sestos on the N. shore must have belonged to the Thracians (844). Acc. to Schol. B, however, Sestos was awarded to Abydos in a dispute with Athens on the authority of this line. The other towns are on the S. shore. *ca/nqos, *po/dargos, *ai)/qwn, and *la/mpos, the two first clearly refer to colour; but the last name would support Ameis's interpretation. [4.242]. The Pelasgians are introduced as though they were inhabitants of the Troad, all the preceding nations being evidently regarded as lying within the dominion of Priam, though having their own chiefs; cf. kaq' *(amacito/n, only twenty-five miles from Troy (Strabo p. 620). But this does not suit th=l' a)po\\ *lari/shs. On this ground Strabo decides for Larissa near Kyme in Aiolis. The simplest explanation is to suppose that the Catalogue speaks of the Trojan Larissa, but that the poet of P was thinking of another. This he might easily do, as no less than eleven towns of the name are recorded by Byz. Steph. and Strabo (p. 440). The name is always brought into connexion with the Pelasgians \u2014 whether as a historical fact or as a mere hypothesis we are not in a position to say. For the Kikones see The Paionians are elsewhere described as spearmen and charioteers, a)grote/racannot = a)dmh/s. However, the discovery of the breeding of mules is attributed to the Mysians, who were neighbours of the Paphlagonians and gave Priam his mules; see note on *)enetoi/(or *(enetoi/as Strabo writes) were Illyrians (subsequently the founders of Venice). It was concluded that they must have emigrated W. from Paphlagonia very soon after the Trojan war. Mules are of course commonly mentioned in the The lines added by Kallisthenes (vide supra) are of course intended to remedy the omission of the Kaukones, who appear among the Trojan allies in In this line we appear to reach fairyland. The conjectural readings of the ancients (vide supra) shew that no identification with historical regions was possible. *)alu/bh, as Strabo says, may be *xalu/bh: the Chalybes in historical times were famous miners, but produced iron only, not silver, a)rgu/rou phgh/of the silver mines of Laurion in These Mysians are Asian, and geographically, at least, distinct from those of Thrace, see on [13.5].

In There seems to be no choice here but to accept the vulgate h)u/te, h)u/te ( h)u/t') o)/reus, introduces a non-Homeric contraction, as Ar. pointed out; the few other instances of it are very suspicious ( *)ere/beus, qa/rseus, qe/reus, qa/mbeus, see w(/s t', adopted by van L., is merely another instance of the passion of that MS. for the introduction of Attic forms into the text. h)u/teand eu)=teare obviously different forms of the same word, cf. h)u/sby eu)=: there is indeed nothing to prevent our writing hu)=teat once, as in the old alphabet they were indistinguishable.

(and Zenod. included 18 also) on the ground that a warrior would not be arrayed with a bow and panther-skin if he were challenging heavily-armed foes to combat. But this objection would equally apply to proma/xizen above. Ar. and most of the other ancient critics also omitted the o( de/, etc., without any change of subject. He quotes dhi+oth/s. The idea seems to be that the lion comes upon a quarry just killed by a hunting party, and eats it under the eyes of the hunters and hounds. Similar pictures of the intruding lion occur in zw/wi, a living animal. But Ar. was clearly right in saying that H. never uses sw=ma of the living body. It is likely enough that the poet was not acquainted with this habit of the lion; or it may be that the lion's repugnance does not in fact extend to an animal out of which the life has hardly gone, as is notoriously the case with lions in captivity.

The story was that Aithra, daughter of Pittheus, was the mother of Theseus.

At the taking of Troy, the sons of Theseus, Demophon and Akamas, found their grandmother there among Helen's handmaids, and took her back to Athens. The legend was dealt with in the *)ili/ou pe/rsis Aithra was a regular episode of the Iliupersis on Attic vases of the fifth xro/nou(Schol. A).

These arguments are not weighty enough to prevail against lines which are spirited and thoroughly Homeric. With regard to (1) it may be remarked that the goddess takes a disguise primarily in order to remain unknown to the bystanders, not to Helen; the gods in such cases often give some sign which reveals them to those to whom they speak, see a)ri/gnwtoi de\\ qeoi/ per, where Poseidon has appeared in the character of Kalchas. 396 was apparently before the author deirh/n te kai\\ o)/mmata however, true that this intimate converse of a goddess with a mortal, even after recognition, is such as we find only in the later strata of the For the double acc. with tou=to u(ma=s e)capath=sai, w(s. 400-5.

In other words, we have to deal with a case of critical opinion on the one hand, and MS. tradition on the other, though what we know of Ar. will induce us to believe that the reading of the critics had a foundation in the MSS. which has not survived.

The use of so soft and weak a wood as poplar for the felloe of a wheel is certainly curious. The wood is suited to the purpose, however, by its flexibility and elasticity. Ameis suggests that the bronze tire ( e)pi/sswtron) would supply the requisite hardness.

None of them seem to have hit on the absurdly simple explanation that Pandaros may have attempted to 'duck,' bending his head forward a moment too late.

This is an interesting, because evidently accidental, proof that in the oldest form of the Epic poems the ictus in the penthemimeral caesura sufficed to lengthen a final short syllable without the aid of the n e)felkustiko/n, which originally was not used to make position.

The most probable event would be that he would fall out of the back of the car; for in any other direction the rail and framework of the car would support him. He might then lie with his feet still in the car, and his head and shoulders upon the ground. But then it is hard to see how the horses could be said to kick him; and the Homeric chariot was hardly large enough to hold the whole of the legs and part of the trunk of a man in a reclining position. It would seem, therefore, that he was standing sideways in the car, so as to look at his enemy while he wheeled; and when wounded fell backwards over the side of the car, his knees hooking over the a)/ntuc. The 'soft sand' explains why the car was brought for a while to a standstill; it would be absurd to suppose, as some commentators have done, that his head dug a hole in the sand so as to keep him fixed. ga/r r(' and yama/qoio seem to be mere makeshifts for the sake of the metre.

(Reichel p. 107 objects that the 'Doric' peplos could have been girt up, and that Athene is constantly represented in art as wearing it with armour. He concludes that she must here be conceived as wearing a prae-Dorian dress such as the flounced Mykenaean skirt. But this inference does not seem justifiable.) Zen. rejected 734-6 here as borrowed from For the [2.447]. 739-42. The whole of this passage, with 744, is open to the gravest doubt. It bears a most suspicious resemblance to the unquestionably late account of Agamemnon's panoply in *dio\\s te/ras in *l. It is impossible to imagine that, as the words imply, fo/bos is an allegorical figure depicted as a circular ring round the edge of the shield. At best it might be supposed that fo/bos and the other personified spirits of battle in 740 (for which see o)mfalo/s: if this is meant, the change from peri/ to e)n in 740 is a most unhappy method of expression. It is equally impossible to understand the description of the helmet \u2014 see note on 744 below. And finally, the lateness of the lines is proved by Furtw\u00e4ngler's demonstration (Roscher [2.447], and shows that the difficulty of the passage was felt in early avert the evil eye and other dangers. The sense of this line is anything but clear, and it must share the suspicion attaching to 739-42 above. a)rarui=a seem a likely word to express the metallic adornment of the Homeric age, which consisted of Here we can only conceive the figures as riveted on. i(pph=es, or pru/lis, the Cretan word for the wardance, and may therefore have once meant champions who danced in front of the army to provoke the enemy. Eustathios and others have seen a further allusion to the hundred cities of Crete; and the line may therefore be one of the passages which seem to have a special connexion with that island. See on [18.590]. Zeus was of course the tutelary god of Crete; and if we suppose that Athene takes his helmet as well as his chiton and aegis, the idea may be that he bears as his blazon chieftains representing the subject cities of his island. But all this is mere conjecture, with no Homeric analogy to support it. Ar. read da/mnhisi: but the subjunctive is out of place in a direct statement as to the use of the spear; in other words we have here a kote/ssetai implies 'with Observe the freedom of the imagery by which the gate, though said to be a cloud in 751, is made to creak. e)pitetra/fatai Bergk, from Athenaeus (iv. 134, which is only a parody, not a quotation); but the singular is quite defensible, as ou)rano/s and *ou)/lumpos if not identical are at least closely connected.

But there is no trace of omission in the MSS.; the statement about Zen. only means that he did not like Ar. reject it as borrowed from e)pi/rroqos, \"pleonasmw=i tou= tar,\" and it is obvious that in sense it is identical.

We may compare ph/dinosfor phdo/s(see This is the only case in H. where a god in person condescends actually to slay and despoil a human foe. *)ai+/dhshere evidently preserves something of its original sense, the Invisible ( *)avi/dhs). It is of course not necessary to suppose that the poet conceives Athene as literally putting on a cap; he only employs the traditional \u2014 almost proverbial \u2014 way of saying that she makes herself invisible to Ares. This line is perhaps interpolated by a rhapsode who read e)cena/ricen in 842, and thought that an infinitive was required after e)/asen. This idea led to other unmistakable interpolations, see o)le/ssai, but this by Homeric usage could only mean to u(p' e)k, which appears to be accepted by almost all edd., though no approximately satisfactory explanation has been given of the word, which can only mean 'from under.' Athene of course is on, not under, the chariot; and to suppose that she could direct the shaft from a place where she was not herself is to make her very unlike a Homeric deity. Still, the old idea seems to have been that Athene actually put her arm under the chariot, for Schol. B on 851 by Athene in a similar way. With the reading of A there is no difficulty mi/trh see App. For mi/trhi: both cases appear to be equally Homeric; see This hyperbolical distich recurs in -xeiloi apparently attributed to Ar. by Schol.

These are clearly due to invasion of the thematic forms by analogy; an invasion which in these particular verbs was finally repulsed, though it overwhelmed many others. As the MSS. are of no authority in a matter such as this, it is impossible now to say whether the 2nd person succumbed like the 3rd, the metre here giving no help. See mo/nos, au)to\\s d' e)k kefalh=s glaukw/pida gei/nat' *)aqh/nhn. The legend of the birth of Athene from the head of Zeus is found also in tritoge/neia(see on su\\ te/kesabove (875) note on 397.

If so, it is probably a late and wrong reading, for which a)na/sxeton ought to be substituted here (so Wackernagel): mere possibilities of confusion do not set aside the ordinary laws of linguistic formation. According to another view we have a case of 'Epic diectasis' for a)/sxetos, cf. a)/sxeton, ou)k e)pieikto/n. This is likely enough in a passage of late origin, and perhaps contemporaneous with the formation on false analogy of o(ra/ais for o(ra/eis through the stage o(ra=is, etc. e)nesi/hisin, which could not otherwise be used.

The mid. i)qu/nesqai recurs only The reading of this line is one of the most puzzling problems in Homeric textual criticism. The MSS., as will be seen, adopted it in his 'notes,' but afterwards changed his mind and introduced the text, presumably, into the second or both of his editions; the ground for the change being that the vulg. better agreed with his view of the topography of the Greek camp, on which, as we know, he wrote a special dissertation. Now the consensus of our MSS. makes it practically certain that their reading was also that of Ar.'s vulgate. What then is the meaning of e)n toi=s a)rxai/ois? The phrase does not recur in the existing scholia of Did. or We An.find indeed e)/nioi tw=n a)rxai/wn quoted by An.as [14.214]. But the preposition e)n (not para/ forbids us to take the adj. as masc. here; the only substantive we can supply is a)ntigra/fois. But then we are landed in the absurdity of supposing that Ar. was in possession of a whole class of MSS. which could be described as 'ancient' in comparison with his ordinary vulgate; and yet that he paid so little attention to them that they are never again named. (The alternative supposition, that the 'ancient MSS.' were in fact the vulgate, and that Ar. by his own authority succeeded in introducing a new reading into the vulgate after his time, is so absolutely opposed to the general evidence of the documents that it need not be seriously considered.) Hence various attempts have been made to emend the much less drastic change will do all that is needed. I have little doubt that the correct reading is e)n tai=s a)rxai/ais, sc. e)kdo/sesin. The 'early editions' are in these editions included those of Zen. and Aph.we naturally cannot say; but it is clear that there was an authority in favour of the variant, which Aristarchos so highly regarded that for a time he preferred the variant to the vulgate, just as he did in stomali/mnh. This 'estuary' is not again mentioned, but modern evidence shews that such an estuary must have existed at the mouth of the Dumbrek Su (Schliemann stomali/mnhis used by Strabo (xiii. 595) of this particular estuary, and more generally of the delta of the Rhone. Theokritos has the form stoma/limnon. But the regular late Epic form (Ap.

The note of interrogation after h)= is diaporhtiko/s, interrogative. On the whole it is more Homeric to have two consecutive questions in a case like this than a question followed by an indignant exclamation: pepoi/htai, for the human sacrifice in ai)/sima does not in fact imply an absolute moral standard (cf. on 162), beyond what is implied in ai)=sa *)odush=os e)pessu/menos. The word occurs in later Greek, e.g. tou= eu)= zh=n e)pib., with the purely mental sense like e)pe/ssutai. Cf. the use of e)fi/emai, e)/nara). The situation seems to change rather suddenly here; the words of Helenos in 96-101 would naturally follow some such account of Diomedes' exploits as we have had in E rather than the detached combats of the last 72 lines, in which he has appeared only as one among many Greek heroes. All these combats are evidently such as must have formed the stock-in-trade of the Epic poet for use wherever needed. They may have been inserted here to form a transition from the episode of the wounding of Ares. it is clearly used of the tumultuous rout of the vanquished, who by a bitter sarcasm are said to take refuge in their wives' arms. o(/soi keklh/ato boulh/n; perissoi\\ oi( du/o(88-9), and Brandreth and van L. would reject 89, on the ground that the contracted oi)/casafor o)i+/c. is not Homeric, that klhi+/sin H. means o(/ after Bentley on account of the v of voi, and there can be little doubt that this is right. o(/ must of course be taken as the masc. of the relatival article; see note on [5.338]. The mention of the peplos carries our thoughts to the Panathenaic festival at Athens. But the idea of propitiating divinities by clothing their images with costly robes is not only one of the most natural and universal of primitive cults, but survives in full force to the present day in many parts even of Western Europe. (References will be found in The appeal to Athene is made not because she is a special guardian of Troy, but because she is recognized as the protector and strength of Diomedes; only through her can his valour be abated. The title of e)rusi/ptolis (305) is general. In virtue of her warlike nature she is the guardian of citadels, where her temple stands. The words co/anon such as survived in many Greek temples to historic times. Later legend connected such an image, the Palladium, with the fate of Troy. In view of the objection that such Palladia were always standing, not sitting, figures, Schol. B after explaining e)pi/ as = para/, which is obviously wrong, quotes the authority of Strabo \u2014 who says (xiii. 601) that ancient sitting images of Athene were found in Phokaia, Massalia, Rome, Chios, and several other places.

But then this will hardly suit 224 *)/argei+ me/sswi, where the word is used in the narrower sense. It seems necessary to conclude that the home of the myth was originally in some forgotten Ephyre among the hills of \"Argos,\" and was only later transferred to Corinth. Furthermore, it is open to question whether this Argos was not the Thessalian Argos, rather than the Peloponnesian. It is noteworthy in this connexion that according to Strabo (ix. oi(=ai (frag. 27) Sisyphos is already made the son of the eponymos of the *ai)olei=s, and this agrees with the of the Corinthians ( *korinqi/ois .. ou)=sin *ai)oleu=si It will be observed that the act. and mid. of ti/ktw are applied indifferently to the father; so also of the mother, e.g. According to the legend given by the scholia, Bellerophon, who was originally called *(ippo/noos, got his name from slaying one *be/lleros, a prince in Corinth. Being exiled for blood-guiltiness he came to Argos (or Tiryns) to seek purification from King Proitos. But this of course is not Homeric, the whole conception of purification being later. In fact, with the single exception of the name *(ippo/noos, it is merely made up from the story itself to explain how Bellerophon, a Corinthian, is found with the Tirynthian Proitos.

Such a family, however, regularly includes only the sons and unmarried daughters; so that we can see a reason why here the sons only are in the house, while the married daughters, perhaps by a special favour, are accommodated with lodgings outside the actual do/mos.

His desire that it should happen is shewn only in the anxiety with which he seeks for its conditions, and hence depends entirely on the interrogative form of the sentence. In short ke necessarily implies some conditioning circumstances, whereas a wish necessarily excludes them. It seems therefore inevitable that we should read de/ with Bekker.

But for the authority of Ar. such an elucidation would probably not have been listened to for a moment. It can hardly be called Greek, much less Homeric. The only resource is to adopt the reading (1); it must be admitted that it has all the appearance of a conjecture, and can only be approved in comparison with absolute nonsense. There is no explanation of how the nonsense came to be the vulgate.

These lines look like an interpolation intended to bring in the name of Astyanax, so well known from the Cyclic poems (cf. Pausan. x. 25. 9), but evidently is that Astyanax is called by a name which, by way of compliment, refers to the father, as Eurysakes has his name from the broad shield of Aias, Telemachos because Odysseus was fighting far away in his boyhood, Megapenthes from Menelaos' grief at the loss of Helen, son Peisistratos from his father's exploit ( va/nac, which is explained by e)ru/eto, conveyed much the same as the poimh\\n law=n.

The old Epic greaves were probably not of metal at all (App. B).

Compare e)u+plo/kamos, e)u+/zwnos, e)u+/trixas also h)u+pa/teira, which we should read with L. Meyer in eu)pate/reia: cf. h( d' eu)pa/teira filoge/lws te parqe/nos in a fragment of Menander.)

This line was athetized by Ar. on the ground that Helenos had understood the counsel of the gods only dia\\ th=s mantikh=s. This is a frivolous objection; prophets have always been accustomed themselves to describe the divine admonitions as a voice speaking to them, even when the outer world gives a different name to the communication. The previous line, though not rejected by Ar., is open to far graver objection. For it corresponds to nothing in the words of Athene or Apollo above, and seems quite inconsistent with Hector's words in 77, to say nothing of his behaviour in 216. 54-6 = *g.

Hentze, however, remarks that the only other instance in Homer where a speaker alluding to himself by his own name adds a laudatory epithet is in *zh=n' u(/paton mh/stwra.

This somewhat grossly corporeal conception, however, must be regarded solely as a figure of speech; the Homeric gods employ, in fact, more subtle powers, and it is a reversion to an earlier stage of thought when we find the Ephesians stretching a rope from the city walls to the temple of Artemis in order that the goddess may help the defenders ( pei=rarin tanu/ssai, a distinct allusion to the meaning The variant qana/toio teleuth/ must be the origin metae For deciterh\\n in the on the ground that the text is rather rude to Menelaos.

Ar. took kela/donti as an attribute of the Iardanos. In fact the name 'Jordan' ( kela/dwn. The name recurs in *kela/dwn: it is clear that nothing short of the excision of 135 as copied from [2.692]. This Lykoergos is included in the list of early Arkadian kings given by Pausanias (viii. 4. 10), who further mentions the 'narrow way' which was pointed out as the scene of the death of Are\u00efthoos, and was even adorned with his tomb (viii. 11. 4). This is no doubt, however, founded upon the Epic, rather than upon genuine local tradition. The steinwpo\\s o(do/s evidently implies a pass so narrow as not to allow the korunh/ths room to swing his club. For the form *luko/ergos see on [6.130]. [11.144]. No variant is recorded here. It is clear that if the now aged Nestor took the armour in question in his early youth (153) from the man who had it from Lykoergos in o(/n in l. 9 refers to 'King Are\u00efthoos' of the line above, so that 'Are\u00efthoos the Maceman' had a son, 'King Are\u00efthoos,' who, we must suppose, migrated from Arkadia to Boeotia; and that Menesthios is grandson of Are\u00efthoos I. and son of Are\u00efthoos II. This explanation is so forced as to drive us to the conclusion that the author of the present passage was as vague about his legendary history as about his geography. But difficulties of this sort are familiar in the tales of Nestor's youthful exploits, all of which bear the mark of late work, introduced with no special applicability to the context, but rather with the intention of glorifying the ancestor of Peisistratos. w(=i can be taken as the pronoun of the third person: (1) to fight against bi/h in the sense of 'a strong man,' for (2) the use of the quasi-personal epithet megalh/twr with qumo/s.

But this is against all the history and use of the pronoun; the sentence really means, not 'draw lots to see who shall be chosen,' but 'draw lots (for one man), and he shall be chosen.' Practically of course the meaning is the same, as the idea of a question is inherent in the drawing of lots; but theoretically the distinction must be carefully observed. Cf. See qeoi=s, i)de/.

The exact form of the word is, however, doubtful. There was a variant bw= for bo/a, but as the Homeric form must have been bo/va this does not deserve much consideration. Aristophanes read bou=n. We have some (very slight) testimony indicating that bw=s was a form in actual use, in Hesych., bw=n: a)spi/da, *)argei=oi, and Priscian vi. ou)=n.

Reichel remarks that only two evolutions were possible with the ponderous Mykenaean shield; it might be slung either to the right, over the back, for retreat; or to the left, so as to cover the breast.

In fact we have here another case of two parallel and independent versions of the same theme brought into the narrative. One is as 'genuine' as the other; both are late. It must, however, be noted that out of the twenty-two lines the following appear more or less in other places: 443 = Poseidon is not generally found in Olympos unless specially summoned, cf. e)ne/pw, not of e)ni/ptein (more usually e)ni/ssein) e)ni/ptein in the sense of e)ne/pein. There seems to be a confusion of the two words, as e)ni/yw cannot regularly come from e)ne/pein. Ap.

The curious ritual of the boufo/nia at Athens distinctly brought out this idea; every one concerned in the sacrifice was formally tried for murder, and finally the sacrificial axe was found guilty and thrown into the sea.

The aor., bringing the actual arrival, not the mere presence, of the ships into the picture, adds something to the liveliness of the narrative. Unfortunately it appears to contravene the rule about lengthening before the bucolic diaeresis (see note on [2.751]); but there is a possibility that the a is long by nature, see on [4.146]. This is one of the few allusions in Homer to the legend of the Argonauts. The others are in Here again a conj. of Bentley's, e)/nq' for u(dreu/esqai.

(So Ameis.) It is curious that this line, which evidently alludes to a mere trial of strength by pulling at a rope, e(lkusti/nda, should have been made the base of all sorts of mystical interpretations and esoteric myths from the earliest times. Thus in Plato far-fetched will be found in Eustathios ad loc. The neo-Platonists took up the idea, and from them it was handed on to the alchemists of the Middle Ages, in whose mystical cosmogony the Ameis points out that the o(/te is here strictly temporal, and not merely conditional: 'as soon as I determined to pull.'

It is clear that the poet of these lines has entirely lost the real Epic conception of Olympos as a mountain in Thessaly, and follows the later mythology which removed it from earth to heaven. The following passage, down to 40, was athetized by Aristarchos, on the grounds that it is wholly composed of lines from other places, and that it entirely destroys the effect of the masterful words of Zeus. Few will be disposed to doubt the validity of these reasons for condemnation. In the sequel Zeus unmistakably shews that his threats were seriously meant (397 ff.). The lines seem to have been added by some one who thought that excuse was needed for the moral support so freely given to the Greeks by Athene and Hera, e.g. 218, teei=o for sei=o, which may be defended on the analogy of teo/s ( tevo/s) for so/s.

It is perhaps enough to say that such problems would have been perfectly unintelligible to the men of Homer's time; in a primitive state of thought man does not seek for a rational consistency in his abstract ideas. Such conceptions of fate and of supreme divinity as he has, have in all probability been evolved in his mind by two quite different processes, and he sees no necessity to reconcile them. Indeed the weighing may be taken rather as a declaration by Zeus that the turningpoint has come, than the seeking of a decision from any other power superior to himself. In all cases the result is a foregone conclusion; there is no uncertainty implied. The appeal to the scales recurs in the same words in For the [2.302]. The schol. of An.here is an interesting proof that the consciousness of their ghostly origin long was athetized by Ar., and seems quite indefensible. The dual e(/zesqen mentioned by Schol. The A. lines seem to be a gloss on 72. The sinking of the Achaians' fates (or souls?) is evidently symbolical of descent to Hades, A free use of thunder and lightning is characteristic of this book; see 133, 170, 405. 78-183.

The former is best, as it is not clear that pa/llomai can have any sense but that of [15.645]. The passage is twice imitated by Virgil, parh/oros or extra trace-horse, which is mentioned by Homer only here and in trei=s i(/ppous kai\\ di/fron. paraba/ths: so in h(nioxh=a means the fighter.

In It was debated by the old critics be 'the correct term for catching a word in the tumult of battle.'

These objections could to some extent be evaded by supposing 131 to be an interpolation. mh=xos to evade them.

For the phrase *trw/essi, as is always *trw/essi, 'appointing for the Trojans a turning of the tide of battle.'

A famous shield of Nestor is as little known elsewhere to the See note on [5.273].

It apparently represents the Skt. bw=n represents *zh=s, which might have an accusative *zh=n on the analogy of nouns of the first declension.

The repeated lines here are 216 = It seems impossible to get a good sense out of the text as it stands, and the few variants recorded do not materially help, with the exception of Zen.'s kai/ for a)po/, of which more below. There are two possible explanations of the space filled by the Achaians: (1) ships and wall may be regarded as close together, and the trench at a considerable distance off; the Greeks are driven behind the trench but not inside the wall. (2) Wall and trench are regarded as close together; the Greeks are driven inside both, and fill the space between them and the ships. Of these (2) is by far the most natural, and is what we should like to get; but (1) in one form or another is what the words seem to imply. While a)po/ distinctly implies a)po\\ tei/xeos, a)po\\ pu/rgou with e)/erge is laid upon the kai/ for a)po/, for this makes ships and wall one limit, the trench the other. Now in some places the trench is clearly conceived as being at some little distance from the wall; see particularly sth= d' e)pi\\ ta/fron i)w\\n a)po\\ tei/xeos. The interval between them is the station where the sentinels are posted in I and K. But we are nowhere led to believe that the distance is such as to afford a kai/. With the text we have the following alternative renderings: (a) e)k nhw=n seems entirely otiose. We e)pi\\ pu/rgous, 'all the trench enclosed, from ships to walls.' e)pi/ with acc. is the regular word for expressing extension, as far as a limit, e.g. 224 gegwne/men e)pi\\ klisi/as: and pu/rgoi is rather commoner than pu/rgos when the fortification of the camp is spoken of as a whole. The loss of the final s of pu/rgous would easily lead to the change of e)pi/ to a)po/, e)pi\\ pu/rgou being meaningless.

It is common enough for the substantive verb to be omitted in relative qoh=i brw=si/s te po/sis te: but here the omission is harsh, because the subject of the verb is not expressed.

It has been mentioned in the Introd. that the repeated lines in this a)ristei/a of Teukros are few. They are: 278 = This mode of fighting is characteristically oriental. In the Assyrian sculptures, especially in sieges, we often find a warrior with a large shield and spear accompanied by an archer who crouches down and shoots from under the shield. The same practice is also found, though rarely, on the old Greek vases, and is recorded in the verb u(paspi/zein, The perf. opt. bebrw/qois, ( pefeu/goi?), i(lh/koi.

This is one of the points in which the poems often shew a certain want of clearness. The idea is that it was the practice of each warrior to be accompanied by his chariot close at hand, and to mount or descend from time to time, according to the convenience of the moment. Warriors burdened with the ponderous 'Mykenaean' shield needed chariots chiefly to enable them to move from one point of the field to another, but preferred to fight on foot.

It has been pointed out in the Introduction that Phoinix is evidently a late-comer into the story. He is introduced with surprising abruptness; no explanation is given of his presence in the council, where he never appears again; his proper place would seem, from the sequel, to be with Achilles. From 168 to 432 he is entirely ignored, except for a passing reference in 223 \u2014 a line where he seems to be treated by Odysseus with singularly scant courtesy. The consistent use of the dual in speaking of the envoys in 182-98 naturally puzzled the ancient critics. Two explanations were offered \u2014 one, that the dual was identical in sense with the plural, a theory which is well known to have been held by Zenodotos; the other, that of Aristarchos, that Phoinix was not one of the envoys, but was sent beforehand to prepare for their coming afterwards ( e)/peita 169). The former is naturally untenable (see on [1.567], For Eurybates see e)peufhmh=sai in a(nda/nw in H. Cf. however vevadh#3o/ta = e(/ada. 174-7 = Sch. A; a word recurring only in Ap.

However, we must remember that with epithets of gods we are on especially doubtful ground, as we can never be sure that the Greeks attached any very definite meaning to hieratic words whose sense may even to them have been lost in antiquity. megalh/tori, 109.

This disjointed sentence is very natural in Achilles's great surprise, and it is probably useless to attempt to produce from it one connected logical whole. Two thoughts spring to his lips; first, sincere pleasure at a visit from his friends \u2014 from whom perhaps he has been separated for a fortnight; and next, gratified pride at what he sees is the object of their visit \u2014 a confession of their sore need for him ( h(me/tero/nde (or h(me/teron dw=) gives a smoother sense, but for that very reason is probably only an ancient conjecture. le/gousi, and numerous cf. also the discussions in za( zh=n), zes, zo s aro/s). oi( from one MS.; it gives better sense (cf. 197), but may, of course, be merely an itacistic blunder. oi( is in any case awkward; it can only be taken as strongly deictic = oi(/de, and even then is forced. filta/tw a)/ndre (and so perhaps we should read fi/lw a)/ndre in 197), as the dual always tends to give way to the plur., and legitimate hiatus to be abolished.

Another interpretation is This line can hardly be more than formal after the supper with Agamemnon. scholion would not in itself give us a high opinion of Ar.'s tact or caution; but his critical reputation fortunately rests on safer grounds. Why Odysseus should unceremoniously begin when Aias has signed to Phoinix it would be hard to say, were it not evident that the name of Phoinix has been awkwardly dragged in to remind us of his existence. It is useless to guess what the original form of the line may have been \u2014 possibly something like thus saving the v of voi/noio. : e)sme/n: but, to say nothing of the contraction of -e/es, the omission of both subject and verb is excessively harsh.

The latter is preferable, cf. This line, with the Attic use of the article to express a class, has all the appearance of a late gnomic interpolation.

The usual punctuation places a comma after ei(/let', and a colon after qumare/a: 'he has taken and is keeping my wife \u2014 well then, let him have his joy of her.' This assumes that Achilles can call Briseis an a)/loxos. But that word is always used of a legitimate wife (cf. gnh/sioi e)c a)lo/xou; opposed to dou/lh [19.298]. a seems to be a relic of the old Epic, and has been supplanted by the regular Ionic h in qumh=res kera/sasa xrh/, only here in H.

It will be seen that the story as given in the text is only very partially told, although 533-49 and 557-64 (or rather 572) are inserted, to the damage of the connexion, to explain the circumstances out of which the quarrel had arisen. In any case the story must be read continuously thus: 529-32, 55056, 573-99.

The idea may be that if the lightning is not accompanied by (1) rain, (2) hail, or (3) snow, it must be a portent of war. This seems to place a high importance on 'summer-lightning.'

The optatives in 211 resume that after ou)k a)\\n in 204; in form they are a wish, in reality they are only a suggestion in form of a hope, 'I should like him to find out' \u2014 a shade of meaning which we express by 'he might.' If we read ke for te in 211 (see note there), the expression would be more confident, 'he would'; but this is better reserved till 212, where ken indicates a result which in that case is asserted to follow upon the assumed condition, being virtually equivalent to the future e)/ssetai. We may in fact regard the clause me/ga ken .. ei)/h as an apodosis to the sentence tau=ta .. a)skhqh/s, which in effect, though not in form, is a protasis.

The gnomic te would of course be in place in such a sentence as the present, but it is not used in pairs. a)/mfw d' e(zome/nw, gerarw/teros h)=en *)odusseu/s: or we might perhaps more properly call it a sort of 'distributive apposition' not completely expressed; compare e)rxome/nwn, evidently a correction, is found only in one or two inferior MSS. e)pi\\ nw\\ tw=id' a)ndri/.

Aristotle ends his quotation with nu/c, citing the phrase as an instance of ambiguity in the word ple/w. He did not, however, reject the next line, as Porphyrios mentions his explanation of it (see next note). This puzzling line was rejected, presumably as unintelligible, by the Alexandrian trio. The long commentary of Porphyrios in Schol. B gives a collection of 'solutions,' only two of which deserve serious consideration. None of those which adopt the reading ple/w are satisfactory. The best explanation is the most obvious; the words mean 'more of the night than two (of the three) watches has gone, and the third only remains.' The objection to this is not really serious; it is pedantic to say that if more than two-thirds have gone, a third cannot remain, for the words imply only that there is nothing but the third watch left to act in; there is no assertion that Homer, but the only other instances of its use, except in nom. or acc., are [8.55]. kune/hn seems to be a contradiction in terms, if kune/h means 'a helmet of dogskin' (cf. 335), though such a phrase can easily be justified (v. r(inou= 262) padded with felt ( pi=los) inside, and wound round outside for the sake of strength with thongs; while outside these again came an outer covering of tusks.

The critical questions raised by this line are very important. It will be seen that the text involves taking e(o/s, o(/s: quote statements that there was no explanation to be found in the u(pomnh/mata of Ar. of the obelos which he put against these lines. Ammonios is further stated to have said that Aristarchos first marked the lines with stigmai/ \u2014 apparently a sign of hesitation \u2014 and afterwards obelized them. The question is an important one from the light which it throws on the tradition of the Aristarchean school. With regard to the reading of the line, it seems to shew that the tradition in favour of the second person was so strong that Ar. was prepared to reject the line altogether rather than read the third. There can be little doubt that the text is original and sfi/sin = u(mi=n by a false archaism, the extension to the personal pronoun of the free use still traditionally surviving in the possessive \u2014 an extension very common in the later imitative poets. It is a mere accident that this use should in fact be a reversion to the older stage, apparently forgotten in Greek before the Epic period, when the personal pronoun was used as freely as the possessive adjective. There is no serious internal objection to be raised against bouleu/ousi and e)qe/lousi: it is natural enough for Dolon to speak in the third person to Odysseus and Diomedes of the other Greeks from whom they are separated; and the indic., not the opt., is the regular Homeric mood in such a phrase. This all emphasizes the improbability of the corruption of the third person to the second, while it makes the converse intelligible. 402-4 = d' ai(, which is perhaps preferable. There is no other case in H. of two articles coming together; but in this late book such a consideration is of less weight. dai/ there, as here, only adds another question to those already asked, and thus loses the tone of surprise which it possesses in DAttic. \u00fcntzer would read d' au)=, which is certainly more natural. 409-11 were athetized by Ar. as wrongly introduced from 208-10; his chief argument being that while Dolon answers the other questions he takes no notice of this. ti/s po/qen ei)=s a)ndrw=n. are e(sti/a, and seems here to mean 'hearths' in the sense of 'families'; the whole clause o(/ssai .. e)sxa/rai is thus precisely identical with the phrase e)fe/stioi o(/ssoi e)/asi in e)sxa/ra does not encourage us to understand it of watchfires. It may possibly allude to a primitive way of raising an army by a levy of a man from every 'hearth'; so that in counting the numbers e)sxa/rai would be equivalent to 'soldiers,' and thus be kata\\ su/nesin the antecedent to oi(=sin. For the strange form This is a tolerably complete list of the races which, in the tradition known to us from post-Homeric times, formed the primitive population of the mainland of Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. The Leleges and Kaukones do not occur in the Catalogue, but are named elsewhere in H., e.g. [2.654]. According to the tragedy of that name, Rhesos was the son of the river Strymon and a Muse; which means no doubt that he was a local divinity, like Kinyras of Cyprus, who appears in Homer as a king and contemporary of Agamemnon. Probably therefore *)hi+oneu/s is the Strymon, which is not elsewhere mentioned in H. This identification is ancient, and the name looks like a rivername ( h)i+w/n). There was, moreover, nu=n brotoi/ ei)sin. pela/ssate(one MS. giving -saton) which would probably be altered in order to avoid the hiatus. Quite needless difficulties have been raised about the knowledge of Dolon's name which Diomedes and Odysseus possess here and in 478. An Epic poet is not a realist, like a modern novelist.

Hence Aph.and Ar. obelized, and Zen. omitted, the couplet. But there is no reason to doubt that it stood here from the first. Kinyras was the great legendary hero of Cyprus, who introduced the worship of Aphrodite to Paphos from Syria; in other words, he represents the prae-Hellenic Phoenician period in the island. He was, however, completely adopted into Hellenic mythology in Pindar's time, *ku/pris(see on thlo/se e)/klue. , dw=kein .. kle/osas a this. a)na- implies 'out to sea,' as a)nh/gagen.

It is not easy to see how such a strap could have been of gold, or, as in 39 below, of silver; in the case of Herakles in lthe adj. seems to refer to the decoration there described with such admiration, and something of the sort may be meant here. The plur. is possibly due to the two ends of the baldric attached to the sheath. Van L. understands the word to mean the attachments only, apart from the strap; but these seem too insignificant for separate mention, and this explanation does not suit l. But see App. B, ix. 4.

That they were made of tin shews that the author regarded them as purely decorative, not structural, such as the heads of nails fastening the bronze face on to the backing. At the same time it may be pointed out that the intaglio, App. B, Fig. 3, shews rims of dots, apparently knobs, running in a circle round the Mykenaean shield. But how the central boss is to be reconciled with the Gorgon head and the figures of *dei=mos and *fo/bos we cannot say. We must either read tw=i for The reading leukoi/, which is attested, though not approved, by the scholia, is highly probable, though not absolutely necessary, as the pause at the end of the first foot may excuse the lengthening; cf. -oio, yet it is attested for Pindar, Simonides, Archilochos, and Lasos, and is found apparently in an Attic inscr. of the 6th cent.

Pausanias, in his description of the chest of Kypselos (v. 19. 4), shews us how the Greeks of that time conceived the personified *fo/bos on this very shield; the scene represented is the fight of Agamemnon and It is as clear as such testimony can make it that this is a real illustration of Homer, and that the artist had this line before him, though with the characteristic instinct of a Greek he has simplified the design by leaving out *dei=mos and the Gorgon.

The whole of the opening of the book is of a piece. Compare the ai(mato/essai yia/des which bode the death of Sarpedon, With this line at last we seem to be again in the original stream of the oldest part of the poem; it describes the first array of the Trojans for battle after the retirement of Achilles.

The last six (78-83) were condemned by all the old critics, and the rest fall into the same category, with the obvious allusion to the sending of Eris in l. 3, and the probable reference to the commands of Zeus to the gods at the beginning of *q. The idea seems to be that the contest holds the heads of both parties on a level, does not suffer either to go down before the other. Ameis thinks that the u(smi/nhi .. e)/xon is no better, as These lines are hardly consistent with the action taken by Hera and Athene in 45. But the contradiction is perhaps not too glaring for the author of 1-55. 78-83 a)qetou=ntai o(/ti yeu=dos: of course the divine allies of Troy would not blame Zeus for giving their side victory, so that pa/ntes cannot be right.

It was obviously necessary, after Hector's triumphs in *q, to explain why he does not now meet Agamemnon; in the original *mh=nis he had not yet appeared at all on the scene, so the difficulty was not felt.

Forty-five passages absolutely require the v, and over 170 admit of it (Kn\u00f6s p. 215). It seems strange that this formula, which must be an old one, should afford so large a proportion of the violations. Emendation is easy but indefensible. The line is in fact the strongest support for Usener's theory that the last syllable of the (dactylic) 3rd foot was originally an vin what seems to be an equally old o<*>xesqai), while a brave man proves his courage by standing his ground. If we take it as a special reference to the Greeks, and to Diomed in particular, the general sentiment of 409-10 comes in rather awkwardly.

If we accept te/los, we may read either katakai/rion, 'a fatal end came not to him,' which seems to be meant by the concluding words of the scholion cited; cf. the phrase 451 te/los qana/toio.

This would remove all cause of offence; 504 comes much more naturally after the stubborn resistance of Aias than after the account of Hector's ravages.

Van L. suggests for the fragmentary lines probably gives the general sense. But as ] anoio is now read in the first line we must supply something like though approved by most modern edd., hardly seems sufficient to condemn the line, which fairly represents the primitive stage of Homeric medicine. The third letter of the added line in the Papyrus is 'fighter.' It must be remarked that Hector's approach seems to have no effect whatever on the fight; he is not mentioned again, and the retreat of Aias is finally ascribed to Zeus. Hence it is not without reason that many critics reject the present passage (521-43). It contains many unusual expressions, and the following lines recurring elsewhere suggest borrowing: 531 = Cf. e)/rida, but compare e)/rida profe/rontai. The idea seems to be 'throwing into the midst' between the contending armies. The most likely restoration of the Pap. in 529 (530 being omitted) is van L.'s of elision is common enough. h)=san, see ai(, which implies a much later use of the article.

It is inconsistent with the promise of Zeus to Hector, as well as with the next line, and is moreover hardly to be translated; it should mean 'Zeus was wroth, whenever he fought with a better man,' which does not make sense. Even if we can get out of it the sense 'Zeus was indignant that he should fight,' the reason for this emotion remains inexplicable. But considering the character of the preceding lines, we are hardly justified in rejecting 540-2(-3) by themselves, as most critics do. *ai)/anti. , against the canon of Ar., seems here clearly to mean tre/sse. telamw/n) in such a way as to protect his back while retreating. This is probably the manuvre expressed by meta\\ nw=ta balw/n a)na/gein in the same sense, verbatim It is not likely that Ar. differed in the two places, so that we cannot say what his real reading was. Editors write e)sseu/anto, which is of course unobjectionable; but in the face of the co-existence in the tradition of double forms such as e)bh/seto, e)du/seto, etc., beside -sato there is no need to desert the unanimous tradition of MSS. here and in O. It may indeed be questioned if a pres. stem seu/w is not as much a figment for Homer as a)leu/omai (see on [5.444]). The forms e)/sseua, e)/ssuto, on the analogy of e)/xeua, ke/xuto, point to a pres. * se/ v -w, could become seu- only times). But in katebh/seto used as imperf. in sof this verb is invariably doubled, except when initial. Hence Zen.'s e)cesu/qhin e)sseu/onto, e.g. seu/wntai, which may be referred aor., is trans. in ma/la pi=ar u(p' ou)=das, Allinson in bow=n.

Moreover, the knowledge of the animal is here confined to the simile, and is not attributed to the heroes. Even Hesiod does not name him.

In form they are of course patronymics, but they cannot both be so in reality, for they appear together in 750, and Homer never uses two patronymics together. The ordinary explanation is that Aktor was their nominal father, as Herakles is called son of Amphitryon, and that *moli/wnis a metronymic from their mother *molio/nhor *moli/nh(so Pausan. v. 2. 2). This is unlikely; the form *moli/oneis against it (though we may perhaps compare *deukali/dhs= son of *deukali/wn), and metronymics are almost unknown in Greece (Nessos, however, is *filuri/dhsfrom his mother in Hesiod and Pindar). Others have proposed to derive both *molio/nhand *moli/wnfrom a supposed *mo/los, ancestor of the mother. For this there is no ground. The name Aktor is itself derived from *)aktori/wn, not vice versa; the grandfather of Patroklos (785) is of course a different person. Later mythology made of the two brethren a pair of Siamese twins, difuei=s, with two heads and four legs and arms, but only one body (so Schol. A here and on e(ni/guioi).

No doubt he was an Asiatic Greek completely ignorant of the Peloponnesos. It is as though an inhabitant of Berkshire describing an invasion from the north were made to say, 'We marched to the Thames and found the invaders besieging Windsor; but we defeated them and drove them all the way to the Chilterns, as far as Aylesbury and Slough; and there we stopped the pursuit' \u2014 which would clearly shew that the author knew nothing of the country but metamelei=sqai, etc. 765-6 = Aristophanes and Ar. athetized from this line to 785, on the ground that the composition is prosaic; that they are inconsistent with the charge of Peleus to his son in w(s ei)/dwlon spe/ndei, leaving to his son all the duties of hospitality.

This line, but for the passage in H describing the building of the wall, would naturally imply that the wall had been put round the ships from the first, as an essential precaution.

Throughout the book we are left in doubt as to whether or no there is a space between wall and moat. Much is made of the difficulty presented by the moat up to 200, but after that line it is completely forgotten, and we are never actually told that it is crossed. Franke and Hentze reject this and the following line, on the ground that the difficulty lies not in the descent, but in the ascent on the opposite side. But for a chariot the descent of a krhmno\\s e)phrefh/s is as serious a matter as the ascent.

(1) 141-53 are to be transposed, so as immediately to follow 130 (so 'some' in the long scholion of Porphyrios on the passage). (2) 131-40 and 141-53 are a double recension, and one of them should be expelled (Hephaistion, ibid.). (3) The poet, after stating the main fact, turns back to the circumstances which led up to it; so that 141-53, though subsequent in order, are to be understood as precedent in time, as in Why [7.238] bw=n. tw/, as 145 (and so Bentley conj.).

It is preferable with some of the ancient grammarians to derive a)/lastos (or perhaps rather a)lasto/s) from * a)la/zw, a by-form of a)la/-omai with the sense of a)lu/w.

It has been mentioned in the Introd. that the comparison to a swarm of wasps or bees entirely loses its point when restricted to two men only. Erhardt remarks that we have only to read u(yhla/wn for 175-81. These lines, which the ancient critics unanimously rejected, are plainly an addition meant to explain that the gate where Asios attacked is not that where Hector ultimately breaks in. On this see the Introd. The question probably did not arise in the mind of the author of the Asios episode. Ar. discussed the question in his treatise dh/i+on, which would evade the difficulty, but is too familiar to be corrupted, unless from the Attic form da/i+on.

The Trojans are at the moment looking N.; a bird has passed them 'keeping them on his left,' e)pide/cia, e)nde/cia in those two places as meaning 'on the right hand' rather than 'from left to right.' But the main difficulty arises when we come to the circulation of the wine. Here the drinker is on the circumference of a circle, looking inwards. Thus 'right' and 'left' with regard to the movement of the sun have changed places; if he passes the wine from his left hand to his right, the previously lucky direction, it is now going 'widershins,' the previously unlucky direction. We may get over this by supposing that the wine-pourer goes round the circle outside, and that e)nde/cia is used from his point of view, just as in 201 e)p' a)ristera/ is from the eagle's; 'having the guests on his right' is still the same as 'with further question is raised in Darbishire's paper already referred to, that of the meaning of pro\\s zo/fonto mean 'to the N.,' as the facts require. But then we are obliged to fall back upon the supposed primitive sense of h)w/s, It may be noticed that this indifference of Hector to omens is in the spirit of the Homeric age; the art of augury is little developed and has little positive effect at any time. Signs encourage or discourage a resolution already taken, but they never determine or prevent any enterprise as they did in later times. Indeed they are elsewhere lightly spoken of; 237, and the unjust and violent reproach is not inconsistent with the character of Hector.

But it looks as though confusion with root i)- For Le\u00eftos and Peneleos, the leaders of the Boiotians, see 95-124. The composition of the following speech of Poseidon has given rise to considerable debate. Friedl\u00e4nder was the first to point out the strong evidence of a double recension which it shews. In the first place it is clearly not a mere coincidence that the phrase w)\\ po/poi (99) occurs at the beginning of a speech fortyseven times out of fifty-one, the only other cases where it holds a later position being h(gemo/nos kako/thti in 108, 'by the fault of ma/xontai in 107, 'the Trojans are fighting.' Hence K\u00f6chly supposed with much plausibility that 108 originally followed immediately after 98. Again 114 seems to be addressed to men who are actually fighting, 116 to those who have given up all effort as in 84. Generally too it may be said that the whole speech is so long and so tautological as to be ill suited for its position. 115 is clearly one of the passages which ignore the ninth book, for it directly contradicts the attitude there assumed by Achilles. Various attempts of different degrees of plausibility have been made to reconstruct two or more speeches which have been confused; perhaps as reasonable a solution as any may be found by assuming that one original form consisted of 95-98, 108-115, and another of 99-107, 116-124. Of these the former will then evidently be the oldest, the latter an alternative added after the interpolation of the Presbeia, in order to avoid the too glaring inconsistency with that book; and the present form is an unfortunate result of an attempt to combine the two. pai=des nearoi/ in kou=ros does not imply noble birth or valour, and is used of infants, e.g. nu=n a)nefa/nh h( h(me/ra, Schol.

The obvious reference of this line is to Achilles; meqhmosu/nh a)kei=sqai may be and others simply regard the line as spurious, for which there is no ground. [2.235]. Friedl\u00e4nder regards 120-5 as a separate speech. There is not much reason for separating these lines from the preceding, except the rather tautological harping on meqhmosu/nh.

The former seems to be implied by the use of a ferrule or po/rkhs in au)lo/s of kaulo/s of a sword ( ba/len, and this relation is in the Epic language expressed by the imperf. and Ahrens suggest eu(=, but the contracted form is probably not Epic.

A nom. xro/os is entirely without analogy, and we are reduced to a choice between xrw/s and xroo/s. In favour of the latter is not only the consensus of MSS., but the evident fact that Ar.'s authorities were so strongly in the same direction that he preferred the supposition of an unknown form of the nom. to the easy adoption of Zen.'s reading. On the other hand arises the question whether his authorities were competent witnesses as to a primitive distinction between oo and w. In the oldest alphabet both would be given by O, and the distinction can only go back to the transliteration of the poems. The choice therefore lies open to us. If we read xroo/s we may take the gen. as dependent upon ei)/sato, on the analogy of tuxei=n and other verbs of *)odush=os e)ei/sato, which is rather different, coming under the category verbs of a)llh/lwn e)fi/konto, o(/qi oi( kataei/sato gai/hs, xroo/s as a partitive gen. with phi, but this use, though common enough in later Greek, is hardly Homeric; see on [3.400] and ei)/sato in the sense *v (see on [4.138] and Ahrens xrw/s, and take ei)/sato, with Ar., in the sense of e)fa/nh. La R. objects that we should need an imperf., not an aor., as fai/neto. But the difference between the two is merely that the aor. means 'the flesh never shewed itself,' the imperf. 'was not visible.' La R. suggests that the variant of DT may represent an original keka/lupto, o( d' a)spi/dos, a)/r) being inserted to remove the hiatus. But writing e)k plh/rous is not so rare in the MSS. as to justify this conclusion. a)lkh=s ma/la may be either that two lions come upon a goat which has just been run down by hounds, and snatch it away from them, as apparently for this reason that Zen. read ai)=ge, giving one goat to each lion, but spoiling the appropriateness of the simile. The scholia quote of *veli/ssein Heyne reads sfairhdo\\n sfairi/nda, Bekker sfairhda/ the insufficient analogy of a)postada/, da/, which are all derived from verbs, not from nouns. [11.709]. The allusion is unusually obscure, as Poseidon was not named above (185). Small difficulties of this sort abound in this passage, which is no doubt a work of the final redaction (see Introduction). The mention of 'a comrade' in general terms is unusual; from the regular Homeric practice we should have expected to hear his name. It is surprising too to find Idomeneus, who in It is indifferent whether Idomeneus is described as going to his own hut, as in the text, or coming from that of another, as in the variant. From the strange idea that the e(tai=ros must be Meriones \u2014 who is not wounded \u2014 D\u00f6derlein and others have got into hopeless difficulties over a perfectly simple passage. For Thoas see Attic, 227 = e)ssi/, which suits the usual idiom (e.g. o)tru/neis. e(lw/ria Syr.pres. is rarely found in any non-thematic verb in H.; there appears not to be a single instance from i(/sthmi, ti/qhmior di/dwmi. o)/felo/s ti = o)/felos, o(/s that the appended adj. or pronoun was originally an acc. of relation, though in later Greek it evidently came to be regarded as agreeing with the noun.

Literally a)ndrw=n part of the predicate in a quasiablatival sense, 'a valour of union arises from, is produced by, even sorry men,' on the analogy to to indicate a reading sumfertw=n, which would certainly make the construction easier. According to the legend Molos was a son of Deukalion, so that Idomeneus was the uncle of Meriones. Of this relationship there is, however, no trace in H. Molos is mentioned again only in [3.206]. Schol.

See App. B, iii. 3 266-94 is a passage which has aroused general suspicion, so inappropriate does this verbose vaingloriousness seem at so critical a moment. Beyond this general 'subjective' difficulty, however, there is no serious cause of offence, if we except 268, which is very strange, as we should have supposed that Meriones and Idomeneus, so closely connected in every way, must have had huts near together.

Ar. rightly declared for which must be taken with e)ssu/menon. There is more difficulty on the phrase a(/dhn e)la/an Didymos [19.402]), nor are we justified in adopting it, as it is not linguistically explicable nor can we estimate the authority on which Ar. was inclined to read it. Indeed the mention of the u(pomnh/mata, which seem to have been mere notes, not deliberately published opinions, makes it probable that the verb was no more than a conjectural suggestion based on a wrong interpretation of e(/wmen in a)/sousi would, however, be defensible. Schol. T gives another variant, oi( de\\ a)a/swsi dia\\ to\\ a)/shn e)mpoiei=n, but this may be a mere error for e(a/sousi, and has in any case no advantage over it. We must then accept and explain the text as it stands. The question arises whether pole/moio is a gen. after a(/dhn or not. Some have taken it as a local gen., 'to chase him to his heart's content pedi/oio, etc.). It would seem then that we must take it as a gen. after a(/dhn. But here again Homeric analogies fail us. a(/dhnoccurs, beyond the phrases already quoted, only in a(/lisnever takes a gen.

But this use of the acc. in H. is not sufficiently elastic for such a conclusion (cf. e)la/sairepresents some lost verb which we cannot now discover. With respect to the breathing, a)/dhnor a(/dhn, it may be remarked that the best MSS. give the former with very few exceptions. Ar. however preferred the rough breathing, which is the more correct if, as seems probable, the root of the word is Though this line is omitted by five important MSS. and is of a familiar type of interpolation, a couple of explanatory words kai\\ ei) of all known MSS. but one, and had already been conj. by Bentley on the = , 'in standing, stationary' fight, in holding his ground, as opposed to chasing a flying foe ( posi/).

Perhaps it may have originally formed the proem to this book, and been superseded by the more elaborate passage which now begins it. On the other hand the imperf. *dio\\s a)pa/th in the next book. It is noteworthy that the entire MS. authority is for teteu/xeton or teteu/xaton. The former seems to be meant for an aor., though this is not possible, on account of the stem-vowel; it could at most be a thematic pluperf., which is, of course, the same thing as an imperf. The perf. is quite out of place in this connexion. For the termination - eton in the 3rd person of a historic tense see 350 was athetized by Ar. as a superfluous repetition of 348. The form ui(e/os, vi(e/i+, vi(e/es, vi(e/as are all common. 353 = 16. For the acc. of the participle after a)/xqomai see ge/nos. 358-60. The text, the reading of Ar., gives the best sense to this difficult passage; e)palla/cai pou\\s e)pallaxqei\\s podi/, [7.102]; the gods tie the two armies to the rope of strife, and by it pull them backwards and forwards. A somewhat similar explanation was given by Ar., only he distinguished two ropes, one of war and one of strife, This is very artificial and needless. The general sense of the passage would be better given if we could translate e)palla/cantes a)lla/ssein makes this possible, but we should require the pres. part. in place of the aor. There appears to have been a different reading of the passage in which toi/ took the place of a)llh/loisi of toi\\ . . a)mfote/roisi being conflate from the two). toi/ now means the two parties, Greeks and Trojans, and the metaphor is taken from the 'tug of war'; the two sides are regarded as having hold of a rope and pulling one another backwards and forwards. This is in itself intelligible; the objections to it are (1) that the metaphor of rope-pulling in battle elsewhere always indicates divine interference; (2) that the reading a)llh/loisi has very weak support. (In the ordinary reading toi/ e)palla/cante. Confusion began when this was altered to the plural to avoid hiatus; tw/ was changed to toi/, and so seemed to belong to the two armies, and the alteration of a)mfote/roisi to a)llh/loisi was a natural as it is followed by e)n mega/roisin. A truly wonderful variant conjectural sites given by Schol. T, ranging from Thrace to Lykia, ignorance of Kabesos was not confined to Argolis). It is hardly necessary to say that illegitimate sons are ascribed by H. to ladies of high degree only when the father is a god; nor did Homeric Greeks, like those of Alexandria, marry their half-sisters. A still stranger reading mentioned by the scholia is kekinhme/non. th\\n knowledge of prophecy (which, as the scholia on [24.699] rightly remark, the Homeric Kassandra does not possess). [9.146]. He boastfully promises a victory in place of the usual bride-price. So David promises to slay 100 Philistines as the price of Saul's daughter, portrays the man's swaggering character, and, as the scholiast remarks, is in favour of the line which some added after 367 (see above). Possibly it means that he walked upright, not u(paspi/dia in the orthodox fashion (158). ai)ni/ssomai as a future (better ai)ni/comai), which suits the passage well; reading the pres. we must take e(/pe), which was read by Ar. in suni/hmi, sunho/meq'(Menrad suneio/meq' w)kupo/roisinor as an alternative sunh/meqa, with the regular subj. lengthening, from sune/meqa. But this could only be on a false analogy, - e- being here the verbstem, not the thematic vowel. Ar. wrote sunw(/meqa, with interaspiration, and so unlike the other Trojans, with a chariot. The description of his attack on the wall in ma/xh e)pi\\ tai=s nausi/n knew nothing of a wall, but only described a gradual driving of the Greeks along the plain up to their ships, then the casual mention of a chariot among the footmen would be nothing remarkable. Fick suggests that the name is *)/assios, from the town of Assos. For the variant not (see Pausanias v. 14. 2). This is the finest tree which grows in modern Greece.

The text is clearly more suitable. Compare e)pi/skopos *foi/nikos kou/ph. That passage, as we shall see, is of later origin. There is not, however, anything in it inconsistent with the genealogy here. Minosis mentioned also in e(tairi/ssai is intrans. in F\u00e4si has remarked that the selection of the first of the two alternatives is against the usual scheme under which the second is elsewhere always chosen ( This curious statement is apparently connected with a legend of which we see traces in merely an echo of gere/wn i(erw=n) by Paris, betrayed Troy to the Achaians, who in return spared him, and left him in possession of the land; see R.

For this fine simile cf. *ai)nei/an being acc. after me/nen. A similar construction will be found in boh=i qoo/n), and in the patronymic *bohqoi+/dhs bohqo/s and the bohqei=n as early as Herod., and bohdromei=n in Euripides formed analogically. Hence Ar. was no doubt right in preferring the form bohqo/os. (The accent shews that it is from qe/w, not directly from qoo/s). The testimony of MSS. is immaterial. See note on [1.74] for similar cases. The caesura seems to shew that a)rhi+/filos is a real compound in 479-80 = 93-4. moi, see on For w(/s, ingeniously but needlessly; the close repetition of the same word is not avoided in the epic style, and the relative clause repeating a preceding thought is quite Homeric, e.g. a)qlofo/rous, oi(\\ a)e/qlia possi\\n a)/ronto. o(mh/likes. This e.g. new/teroi a)/ndres, pa/ntes o(mhliki/h d' e)moi\\ au)tw=i. a 'two-sided' simile, like that in M 151; the joy of the shepherd, which is merely accessory to the resemblance first brought forward, is made in its turn the basis of another likeness. Friedl\u00e4nder has remarked that this is the only case of w(s ei)/ te in a simile followed by the indic. In eleven cases it has no verb, in nine it is followed by the opt., and in one (I 481) by the subj. Friedl\u00e4nder, on account of this and some minor objections, none of which has any serious weight, wishes to reject the whole simile as interpolated; but a single unusual construction is certainly not sufficient reason for condemning so appropriate and pleasing a passage. The aor. indic. after w(/s te is of course familiar ( ei) does not really affect the question; it merely brings the action into closer connexion with the narrator, calling attention to it as a case put for consideration. Hence it is that w(/s te and w(s ei)/ te are used indifferently in not the last half of the line te e)e/, [19.384]). In all but one of these places it is joined closely with a form of au)to/s, and is used in the strictest reflexive sense. It is very likely, therefore, that it is the emphatic form of the pronoun, like e)moi/ beside moi. This can hardly be considered quite certain, as the e may merely have arisen phonetically before the e(o/s and o(/s. It would naturally be easy to write the longer form in most of the passages where the pronoun is orthotone, and it is quite possible that many instances have been superseded by the familiar short form. tituskome/nwn, precisely as in xro/a. , Did.; and so Nauck reads.

Bowstrings, too, would not be made of wool, however well twisted, so long as sinews could be had ( sfendo/nh here is to be taken in its usual sense. Even if it meant only 'bandage' here (as in Hippokrates it means a surgical sling) the sense could only be secondary, and would imply a knowledge of the weapon. And we know that slings were employed in Mykenaean warfare from the famous siege-scene on the silver bowl, vol. i. p. 572. There is, therefore, no reason on this ground for doubting the present passage; the rarity of allusion to the sling is doubtless due to the fact that it was the weapon of the despised light-armed soldier, and therefore beneath the notice of the heroic poet. But it must be admitted that 600 is added very awkwardly, and has all the appearance of a gloss, though probably enough a correct one. oi( . . poime/ni law=n is not in the Epic style, and the nameless qera/pwn seems to be a common soldier; the Homeric qera/pwn is a brother-in-arms, a hero like his chief. e)/sxeqe is therefore aor. \u2014 unless we adopt the variant e)/sxeto. The readings of Zen. in this line and the next are both wrong; the former on account of the v of ve/lpomai, the latter because the ma/xaira is never a weapon in H., but only a sacrificial knife. See on The position of the epithet kalh=s. See also out' of the eyes does not seem to be a possible effect of a single blow on the forehead, though the eyeballs might be burst.

The connexion of thought in the speech apparently is 'you have been full of wickedness already, and now you add to it by attempting to burn the ships and slay the Achaians'; ku/wnis ai)pei=an. Nauck suggests ai)pu/n, which is likely to be right, as - u/s is not unfrequently used as a fem. but better with the former; see on 315. From here to the end of the speech is generally regarded as an interpolation. To be unwearied in war is not a reproach which is likely to touch an enemy, nor is success in battle a sign of u(/bris. The whole passage seems an expansion of deinh=s a)ko/rhtoi a)uth=s in 621, which is of course not a taunt ('although ye be insatiate'), by means of the commonplaces in 631-37, of which the last is found again in o)rxhqmo/s. So in molph/ clearly implies music. The simple explanation is that the word is exactly similar to our 'play,' in having both a more general application to any sport (as in does not recur, but the act. in place of the mid. is found also in au)to\\s de/, not the article.

The subj. after the historic tense is so rare in H. that we ought perhaps to read e)pau/roi with G. Hermann, in (see also note on [19.280]). As this word appeared unsuitable to a corpse. Apollonius Rhodius read a)naqe/ntes. 658-59. Pylaimenes, king of the Paphlagonians, the father in question, has already been killed, *kulaime/neos in 643; others explained that it was the spirit of the dead man which followed the bier; others again boldly read d' ou)/ sfi for de/ sfi (cf. on [9.453]). But the contradiction, though glaring enough, is really far less vital than many others which are less obvious. nh/poinoi o)/loisqe For the name i is explained by Schulze ( poluvidvos.

In O the Telamonian is intimately connected with the defence of Protesilaos' ship; and this is quite sufficient ground for the momentary association of the two here. This line is remarkable as containing the only mention in H. of the Ionian name. It is very probable that the whole passage is an Attic interpolation, with the object of giving respectable antiquity to the hegemony of Athens over the Ionian tribes, with whom in 689 the Athenians seem to be identified. The epithets a(/pac lego/mena in H.

This weakens the caesura and gives a disagreeable rhythm, but that is to be reckoned among the other peculiarities of this doubtful passage. ma/la intensifies the idea of closeness given by par-, e(/taroi/ q'. Nor is there any analogy for the appearance of the shield-bearer in H.; the hero always carries that weapon for himself. See note on [2.529]. The character of the Lokrians as a tribe of bowmen is unique Even in the a)gxe/maxoi. The whole of this description may indeed be a specimen of false archaism, the interpolator endeavouring to give an air of antiquity by ascribing to the Lokrians a practice which in his own time was unfamiliar. e)u/strofos can bear this sense, we see from the epithet linoqw/rhc ( It is quite unlike Homer to make the sudden change of the course of battle, even to 'a sorry repulse from ships and huts' (723), depend not upon the doughty deeds of individual heroes, but solely on the effect of a body of archers concealed in the rear. Of such soldiers H. always speaks in a slighting tone, and nowhere else do they exercise the least influence on the course of a fight. 725 = ou)ke/ti fukta\\ pe/lwntai, see para/rrhsis: cf. where the supposed 'ellipse of e)pe/essi' can hardly be called a scientific explanation.

If we adopt Nitzsch's explanation primitive sense of a)gapa/zein and a)gapa=n, as found in H., is filo/ceinos, 'shewing whither De\u00efphobos had been taken (538); but the use of the word is curious in a passage where the Greek wall has been so prominent.

It seems to be a case of the not uncommon use of the fem. of the adj. as a subst., though in the present instance the fact that there is a fem. substantive in the immediate neighbourhood to which a)/krhs might refer makes the question a little doubtful. The phrase is fully established in Herod. and Attic Trag. and prose (see Lex.); here also the neighbourhood of a fem. subst. is common but not universal, e.g. ruit alto a culmine Troia, so/on has everywhere MS. authority on its side, though here too Ar. sometimes read sw=n (see on [1.117]). But in so/on and sa/on. Of all these forms sa/os is probably the oldest (cf. saw/teros [9.424]). The phrase recurs in This line in used with an ellipse of the apodosis, as in e)pei/ logically implies me/llw. e)pei\\ ou)de/ (or e)me/); but it had already been conjectured by Brandreth, Platt, and van L. in order to avoid the harsh synizesis, which is however found again in ou)de/ me is better than ou)d' e)me/, as the emphasis conveyed by ou)de/ belongs to the whole clause rather than to the personal comparison of Paris to Hector. We were not told in 596 ff. that Helenos had left the field.

Morys and Hippotion are slain together in a)morboi/, It has been pointed out that there is a slight discrepancy with the Catalogue ( The magnificent passage from here to the end of the book is one of the finest of the battle scenes in Homer, and it is tempting to conjecture that we have here part of the attack on the ships as it stood in the original *dio\\s a)pa/th(see Introd. to *c). The metaphor is from one of the 'white squalls' common in the Aegean Sea, which seem to descend from the mountaintops upon the sea. Here the squall is regarded as being sent by the thunderstorm of the helmet (App. B, vii. 3, cf. tetrafa/lhros) may be connected through the idea of brightness (cf. Schulze a)mfi/falos= to\\ e)ne/rgeian poiei=n). The variant pro\\ e(/qen, which has got into the printed vulgate from G, is quite possible in itself, but the analogy of 157 is in favour of e)peira=to. bi-ba/d-qwn (cf. bad-i/zein), like e)/sqein for e)/d-qein. For the scourge of Zeus see [11.418]; the word here seems to mean little more than e) for - eai ( h) for - hai in pres. subj. (see on [2.232]-33).

It has been suggested that, as the immediate purpose of Zeus is the humiliation of the Greeks, he cannot be meant to have sent the omen, which is not said to come from him; so that the people were mistaken in accepting a fortuitous appearance as a divine message. This, however, would not be in the Epic style; it would need to be explicitly stated. As the words of Aias are in the end to be abundantly fulfilled, there is no reason why Zeus should not have confirmed them. a)famartoeph/s a)metroepe/s, on the ground that it is not the stumbling but the excessive boastfulness of Aias' speech which Hector can etc., the sense of bou- may be merely a prefix indicating coarseness, as in bou/pais.

Note that poi=onof the vulg. is evidently meant to avoid the hiatus, here legitimate; poi=onoccurs however three periwph/n. But this order of words is very involved. It is useless to inquire why father and son had thus changed shields, as the Scholiasts of course do. It may be noticed that in 9 \u2014 11 we have three consecutive rhyming lines.

This fine simile is taken from the 'ground-swell' produced by a storm at a distance, and often followed by the storm itself. porfu/reos is applied to waves in kradi/h po/rfure, pro\\ kuli/ndetai to make this clear.

For ga/r r(', but the additional particle is not needed. See on [4.467]. It is clear from the context that u_ as in 75, but the regular u^ is found in ve-vru/-ato). The u_ is probably due to the analogy of other forms where it is followed by a consonant, ei)/ru_to, ei)ru_me/nai ( prumnh=isin. In (1) this is however on [15.653]) and so does de/ which we should expect with (2). Moreover (1) suits the whole tenor of the passage far better. It is a contradiction to explain the distance of the ships from the fighting by saying that the wall where the fighting is was built close to their sterns. On the whole therefore it seems advisable to admit an unusual sense of prumno/s, remembering that the word is not very common, and that in nine out of the 25 places where it occurs it is found in the phrases nhusi\\n e)pi\\ prumnh=isi, e)pi\\ prumnh=isi ne/essi, which are ambiguous, as they are used of fighting which occurs at the outermost ships, and also at their sterns. Similarly prw=tos is used both of the pru/mnh as subst. = pru/mnhisi here with MSS. and Herod.; while Krates had prumnh=isi, presumably adopting explanation (1). It is commonly said that this line is in contradiction to the closing portion of H, as implying that the building of the wall took place at the time when the ships were drawn up on land. This is certainly not involved in the words, and would indeed require an imperf. rather than the aor. e)/deiman. The phrase is purely topographical, not historical. ai)gialo/s in the narrowest sense not being able to hold all the ships, they are drawn up on to the kro/ssas pu/rgwn in is interesting as shewing that the edition of Zen. was without breathings or accents, so that even Ar. himself could not be sure how the letters were to be read; if we are to believe his 'assailant' Ptolemy, he was not even correctly informed as to the letters themselves. The strictures on the form o)ya/ are well deserved; but the alternative explanation, o)/y' a)i+/ontes, gives a perfectly good sense, and was no doubt what Zen. meant if Ar. was rightly informed. The alternative reading attributed to Zen. is not acceptable, as H. uses yau/ein only in the physical sense th=i, o)yei/w is the only desiderative in - sei/w is properly used not of him who causes, but of him who suffers, dejection). The line may well be omitted. There is no reason why the appearance of Nestor should cause dismay, as he is not even wounded; and the use of the verb is quite without parallel. The former objection applies also to the variants ph=ce and plh=ce. The difficulties Ernesti's conj. pth=ce de\\ qumo/s, *)axaiw=n, when pth=ce qumo/n will refer to Nestor's own state of mind. *)axaiw=n as applied to the three chiefs can hardly be right. pth/ssein in H. means elsewhere only e)/pthca qumo/n, Theognis 1015 e)xqrou\\s pth=cai). The line does not look like a mere interpolation for the sake of bringing in Nestor's name, as Ar. thought. dei/dw, which Ar. read, apparently preferring a spondee in the first place. The only exception is dei/dw is explained as a contraction of dei/doa = de/dvoa from de-dvo i)- a, whence also comes dei/dia = from the analogy of dei/dimen, deidio/tes, etc. ( dei/dwmust be a false form.

The so-called 'attraction' of the mood in the subordinate clause to the opt. of the principal clause (as o(/n . . a)/goito is here in relation to o(\\s e)pi/staito) merely means that the condition is regarded from the same point of view as the main action.

See Did. says that Zen. athetized this line and Aph.omitted it; Ar. though not named must also have athetized it, as the obelos is affixed in The A. verse is unobjectionable in itself, and if the genealogy is to follow the father's name seems indispensable. But the whole passage from 114 to 125 is not only needless but incongruous, and quite alien to the character of Diomedes, who is fond of alluding to his father's prowess, but could hardly give a jejune catalogue of his relationships at such a moment. It is no doubt an interpolation, like many others, of the genealogical school connected with the name of Hesiod. The objection to 114 that Tydeus, though killed in the siege of Thebes, was buried, according to the later legend, at Eleusis, is of no weight; for Pausanias (ix. 18. 2) says that his tomb was shewn at Thebes as well. e)cege/nonto is strange; cf. *porqei=, and so Ar. wrote disulla/bws, but the contracted form is against all analogy; the only case where it is required by the metre is *)axillei= e for h is on the analogy of *)atre/i+, *tude/i+, the only other certain instances in H. (see, Pherekydes, whom they quote, Tydeus was driven away for homicide and obtained absolution in Argos. This is the familiar form taken by legends of migration; the absolution is a postHomeric idea.

This is ingenious, but hardly Homeric. If we may accept the statement of Eust. that the word was not really Greek, but borrowed, a strikingly appropriate explanation can be found in the Semitic languages; for the Hebrew siflo/sof the xitw/n, oi)=nos, etc.). also note The following koni/ein pedi/oio. Cf. 147-52. Poseidon appears to drop the character of the 'old man,' and to shout in his own person, without fear of Zeus.

It is possible to join sta=s' e)c *ou)lu/mpoio by the ordinary pregnant construction, a)po\\ r(i/ou to go with ei)sei=de: but the order of the words is less natural, and we have to limit the meaning of *)/olumpos in such a way as to exclude the r(i/on from it. Another explanation of these phrases will be found in Jebb's note on Bentley, offended at the neglect of the v of ve/, conj. e)ntu/nasa, but this change to the nom. would be very harsh. P. Knight saw that e)/v' au)th/n, e)ve/ being the emphatic form of the 3rd person implied in the later compound e(auto/n; see note on [13.495], and compare The subj. i(mei/rasqai, and therefore could not be spoken of with more confidence than its condition, even if we were prepared to admit the use of the subj. after a historic tense into H. at all; see xeu/ei), in which he has been followed, strange to say, by Bekker, B\u00e4umlein, and D\u00f6derlein.

Most of the readings recorded above are no more than interpretations of an original alloteh i epinussenefetmh i): the only actual variants are allotesh, alloqeh, and epenussen. But of all the alternatives none can be right. Those which read a)/llote, with the pause at the end of the third foot, are metrically intolerable, while those with a)/llo give no satisfactory sense. Ar. indeed assumed in his reading (that of the text) an ellipse of kata/, a)/llois then that there must be a very ancient corruption of the text, to be emended by conjecture.

The first part of this conj. has now some MS. support; if there ever existed a variant e)pi/nusses(or - as) we should have expected to find some notice of it, but in the fragmentary state of our excerpts this objection is not fatal. The whole context (to say nothing of *dio/sin the next line) shews that the e)fetmh/is that of Hera, not of Zeus, and that Zeus cannot be the subject of e)pi/nussen: so that we cannot read any form of e(o/s, in view of its reflexive sense, except with e)pi/nusses.

The whole idea, as well as the expression, of this passage is extraordinary; the suggestion of a change of armour in the hottest of the fight can hardly come from a poet familiar with real war, as the poet of *l, for instance, must have been. Even if the climax of absurdity in 376-77, 381-82, be expelled, the passage is not much the better, as we must assume that the soldiers have, as a rule, only their second-best shields with them, and retire pa/naiqai ko/ruqes are a superior sort to those which they have. Thus the condemnation of 376-77 (which Ar. and Aph.athetized, and Zen. ou)de\\ e)/grafen) avails nothing. The athetesis must begin at all events with 370, and must extend at least to 382. Even then 383 is left without any context. The whole passage from 352 to 401 is a very poor addition (see Introduction).

On the other hand, Sophokles has *selloi/(see below), so that the question is very evenly balanced. In either case the sense is the same, su/but the nom. pl. of so/s.

See Delbr\u00fcck Some doubt has been thrown upon the following passage, Hentze and others thinking that 278 more naturally follows immediately upon 258; the actual charge upon the Trojans being narrated in 258, it is not a suitable place for a retardation in the story and a return to the same event in 276 e)n d' e)/peson *trw/essin. Furthermore the passage from 267-77 is almost entirely made up of 'tags' from other parts (267, au)ti/ka . e)n *trwsi\\ . . o)/rousan. To this it might be replied that the principal verb in 258 is e)/stixon, and the description is that of the march tou/s\u2014 or rather tou/s t'\u2014 for tou\\s d'in 263), and thinks that the simile gains force, as describing the keenness for war of the Myrmidons, if the wasps' a)lwh/n, , a word of doubtful formation, found only here. In sense it is evidently equivalent to e)ridmai/nwsin e)reqi/zwsin, and shews no relation to e)ri/zw, to which analogy would lead us (cf. the explanation of e)/qontes this is certainly right.

The following passage contains many difficulties and inconsistencies. The opening simile is obscure. The unexcused and unexplained flight of Hector in 367 is strange after his very different attitude in 363. a)po\\ new=n, as they are no longer a)/cantein 371 is doubtful, and the omission of the digamma in a(/rmat' a)na/ktwnhardly remediable. It is clear, then, that there is some interpolation. Naber would reject only 367-71, but this, besides leaving the questionable simile, gives a very harsh repetition, . i)axh=i te fo/bwi teseparated only by a single line. The least that can be condemned is therefore, as it would seem, 364-71. The interpolation of the last four lines is easily explicable, if it be admitted that the original *mh=nisknew nothing of the wall; when it had once been inserted into the poem, it needed mention in a retreat as much as in an advance. On the phrase eu)di/hs is interesting; it might mean 'amid clear weather,' but it does not help the metaphor. eu)/dios is not a Homeric word, and in later poets the i is always short, except rarely in arsis. \u2014 The simile is very vague and inappropriate; 'as a storm-cloud appears on the face of heaven, such was their shouting and panic out of the ships.' It is hard to see what the point of comparison is. A crowd of men is sometimes called a ne/fos, but there the similarity seems to end. The interpolator of the allusion to the trench seems to have aimed at a counterpart to the great cloud simile of 297 ff.; because the coming of the Myrmidons is there compared to the breaking of clouds, the departure of the Trojans may be compared to the coming of clouds. The result hardly justifies the argument. , describing generally a single spot belonging to each chariot, is not really a support for this; the poet would hardly have said e)n prw/tois r(umoi=sin any case when he meant that all were broken at the same place. It looks as though the interpolator (see Introd.) had adapted a line, perhaps from an old Epic, which applied to the breaking of a single chariot, by simply reading a(/rmat' a)na/ktwnfor a)/rma a)/naktos, under the belief supported by Zen. (probably not without ancient tradition) that the dual could be used as a plural; or the line may merely be made up of pollw=nfor a)/ella, on the analogy of qu/ella. The nom. sing. does not occur elsewhere, and there is no justification for deserting MS. authority. For the use of the word to signify a cloud of dust cf. koni/salos a)ellh/s [15.625]. Editors unanimously read u(po/, MSS. unanimously (so far as is known) u(pai/. Of course the former is metrically adequate; but the latter is quite firmly established and is found occasionally in Trag. (e.g. u(/paiqa, and parai-, metai- in composition. Prepositions originally being adverbs, the locative termination is unobjectionable. There seems to be no reason therefore for favouring one form at the expense of the other. It is likely enough that in many places the antiquated form in - ai has had to give place to the more familiar. ku/mbalon. The analogy with ku/mbaxos ( e)/kpese di/frou ku/mbaxos e)n koni/hisin) is very close, and the two words were doubtless connected; where both are so obscure it is useless to say more, or to correct the text, with Valkenaer and others, to a)nakumbaxi/azon. 380-83. Here again we have a passage apparently interpolated in order to bring in an allusion to the trench. It will be seen that the simile in 384 which refers to the whole Trojan cavalry comes in far more appropriately after the account of the confusion of the Trojan horses at large in 378-79 than where a transition has been made to two single teams in 380 (Patroklos') and 383 (Hector's). The transition, too, from di/froi (379), the chariots of the enemy, to w)ke/es i(/ppoi, P.'s horses, is harsh, because when we first read 380 we suppose that the horses meant are those belonging to the chariots in question; it is only when we come to the end of 382 that we find that we are wrong. The phrase ke/lomai, which requires the infin. to be expressed, and the omission of the object (Patroklos? or his horses?) makes the phrase doubly obscure. This line is interpolated from 867, evidently because the ambiguity of w)ke/es i(/ppoi (see above) was felt to require immediate correction. This very remarkable simile, with which we may compare that in kelainh=i, comparing kelainh=i lai/lapi i)=sos, but the change is needless, and the order of the words is against it. be/bruxe, stena/xontoof reminiscence of the fine simile in [5.5]. Edd. generally read dh/ r(' without authority. 387-88. There are many reasons for thinking this couplet spurious. It entirely spoils the balance of the simile by laying weight on a point which is far removed from the required picture. The phrase di/kas is not Homeric in expression or thought; to H. the qe/mistes are rather laws or principles than judgments to be given, and they are in the keeping of the kings, not, as seems here to be implied, in the power of the community. c, once each in uand f), and in Hesiod, Pindar, etc. (see L. and S., s.v.).

Possibly the word may have been altered by the interpolator; e.g. it may have been tou= (sc. u(/datos), which would seem to have too distant a reference when the two lines had been added. a)potmh/gein is not necessarily the same as our 'cut laimo\\n a)potmh/ceie( a)pamh/seie) a(/ls or shallow water of the coast; when used of water it elsewhere belongs only to ku=ma. Virgil imitates the in our a)potmh/gein e)ph\\n po/lios e)pibei/omen. *mh=nis there was only one wall \u2014 that round Troy; so that after the excision of 364-71, 380-83 there is no longer any ambiguity in the words.

The passage, however, is an insignificant and mechanical production, made up of names and repetitions of lines from other places (411 cf. *)eru/mas(415) was killed a short time back (345); repetition within such narrow limits is usually avoided, even with unimportant names. For the position of the following episode in the story see Introd. e)ste/ [indic.], and the choice is not easy. The latter gives a tone of bitter sarcasm well suited to the passage, 'now ye are swift' (viz. when running away); the point depending on the fact that qoo/s when used of men is properly a word of praise, 'keen in attack'; its use of flying, or at least reluctant, warriors is therefore a strong oxymoron. It is, however, perhaps better to accept the simple and straightforward imper. 'now gen. is clearly partitive; here it is to be explained from the 'improper preposition' a)/nta, and Still more important consideration for us lies in the probability that the whole of the *dio\\s a)pa/th is of later origin than the present passage.

Perhaps Fick is right in regarding the form as evidence of the later origin of 444-49 \u2014 lines which are certainly excessively weak, and would be better away.

If 43261 are rejected, this must go too. There is not much to choose between the readings *qrasu/mhlon. It is true that the conjunction 'flock-bold' may raise a smile; but such combinations arise not uncommonly in Greek from the practice of joining elements taken from the family names of both father and mother. Pheidippides naturally suggests himself; but instances from real life (e.g. *(ro/d-ippos) are quoted by Brugmann Did. The statement of Schol. T that Ar. to escape the difficulty entirely altered the text, adding two lines (see above) is tacitly contradicted by Did. and is so unlike all that we know of Ar. as to be unworthy of credence. In all probability *)ari/starxos has, as often elsewhere, supplanted the name of some less known critic. We have merely to register a departure in an insignificant matter from the usual Homeric practice. To make ou)/tasen a ground for the rejection of 463-76 (Fick) or 467-77 (Lachmann) is going too far. These critics wish to expel the mortal horse Pedasos from the text, mainly because the trace-horse is not found elsewhere; but the linguistic arguments against this passage come to very little, and the narrative shews an obvious gap after either excision.

It was natural enough to those who conceived the soul as actually escaping from the body through the wound. Authority is fairly divided between li/pon: but the latter makes no good sense, as the meaning evidently is that the Myrmidons capture chariot and horses; there is nothing whatever in the narrative to explain how or why the horses could have broken away, as for instance in li/pen to be the 3rd plur. of a passive aor. e)li/phn, of which there are no other traces in Greek (in the pass. sense H. always uses the mid. lipe/sqai), and understood it to mean either a)na/ktwnwith li/pen, sou= leleimme/nhi), a construction which is quite without analogy in H. There would be no difficulty as to sense or construction if we could read with Jortin (Heyne e)pei\\ li/pon a(/rma a)/naktes, but we can say with confidence that if such a reading ever existed it had entirely disappeared before the time of Ar.; and it is one which could hardly have been the does not occur in H., but we have a)naktori/hisiin The following episode with its explicit reference to the teixomaxi/a, is of course at least as late as M: see Introd.

Both the reading and interpretation of this line involve difficulties. Why do the Lykians only now perceive that their king is stricken? The fight over his body has been going on for more than 100 lines; yet the wording of the sentence implies that the sudden change is due not to the flight of Hector, as we should expect, but to the recognition of Sarpedon's fall. Two theories seem possible: (1) The lines belong to an earlier recension of the story, in which the fight over the body was described only summarily in 661-62; 659 originally followed immediately after Sarpedon's fall (perhaps after 505), all the intervening lines being later expansion. (2) 661-62 are a later addition; basilh=a in 660 is Hector, not Sarpedon (Paley). In favour of (1) it may be urged that of the intervening lines we have already had on other grounds suspected a large portion as a later addition (see on 508, 555); while the rest from 569 on is quite colourless; the short battle-pictures relating the deaths of unimportant warriors are of a type which could easily be made to order, and in fact shew a suspiciously large proportion of borrowed lines (see e.g. the note on 604-05). If this solution is adopted, as I think it should be, then we must read either dedai+gme/non or beblamme/non. If on the other hand we adopt (2), the last form is right. beblamme/non h)=tor might indeed mean 'brought to a stop in his life,' but the phrase is unique and by no means natural. bla/ptw is commonly used (a) in the literal sense, of impeding; (b) in the metaphorical, of divine interference causing mental blindness \u2014 bla/pte fre/nas *zeu/s, e)/blaya/s m' e(ka/erge, cf. [15.484]. In this sense of course Hector is beblamme/nos in heart, for Zeus has sent panic upon him. We must then separate pa/ntes from *lu/kioi, and take it to mean basileu/s(cf. *)aleca/ndrwi basilh=i+, *trw/wn basileu=si), as a matter of fact the title is never applied to him; least of all should it be used here, where, after the ( pa/ntes, it cannot but be referred to the king of the Lykians. It is of course this ambiguity which is held to explain the addition of 661-62; but it is much easier to suppose that 506-658 are a later addition, and that beblamme/nonis a mere corruption of beblhme/non(note the transitional variants Note that See on 431. The saving of Sarpedon's body at least is indispensable; after all the fighting over it, we must hear what becomes of the body itself. Zen., who entirely expunged 431-61, contented himself with an athetesis of 666-83, combined with alteration of 666 (he thought that Apollo was on the battlefield). The passage contains, however, some internal difficulties. The narrative in 676-83 is clear, but the same can hardly be said of the preparation for it in 667-75. e)k bele/wn a)ei/ras (678); and in 667, 669 two cleansings are sharply distinguished, though there is no apparent reason for them, and in 679 we hear of one only. This rather suggests that originally Apollo as god of Lykia intervened on his own account to carry off the king of his land \u2014 676 may \u2014 and that 666 ff., with the preparatory scene in 431 ff. were added by a poet who thought that Zeus ought to take the initiative on behalf of his son. \u2014 Zen. raised a general objection to the whole passage, para/logon ga\\r to\\n a)penqh= toiau=ta diakonei=sqai \u2014 the bright Apollo should not be defiled by dealings with corpses. This seems to have impressed Ar. ( mh/pote *zhno/dotos o)rqw=s h)qe/thke tou/tous, Did.), but it applies only to the later Apollo, not to the Homeric.

It is probably not related to di/zhmaiwhere the root is zh- and di- is reduplication. This Asios, who is not heard of again, is of course not to be confused with Asios, son of Hyrtakos, in M and N. It appears from this that Hekabe was herself daughter of Dymas; whereas the later tradition (traceable as far back as Euripides) made her daughter of Kisseus and sister of Theano. So Virgil is adopted by most edd., and is no doubt right if the line is genuine. The second part, however, is unusual, as it appears to describe a stone of small size, whereas those cast by heroes are elsewhere of heroic dimensions. xa/zeto, which most edd. adopt, is doubtless only a conjectural emendation, and has not even the merit of giving good sense; after three lines and a half have been describing Patroklos' vigorous attack it will not do to say that 'he did not long yield before his foe.' Nothing is explained by a reference to the equally obscure mi/nunqa de\\ xa/zeto douro/s (q.v.); and we must either accept the MS. reading or find some better emendation than this.

There appears to be no really archaic word of which this might be regarded as a mistaken imitation, and it remains as a proof that the Greek language in its most vital period was capable of forming compounds beyond the lines of its regular development. As to the meaning of the word, it may be either 'Patroklos' eyes grew dizzy,' or 'Apollo's eyes rolled' in fury. Of these the latter is rather the preferable as the effect upon Patroklos follows in 805.

The shield carried on the shoulder by a telamw/ncan only have fallen to the ground through a blow on the back if the wearer leant his head so far forward that the strap could slip over it.

We here, for the first time in this book, come upon the idea that Patroklos has been wearing the armour of Achilles; and it is in a passage which is for many reasons suspicious. In the first place, it is somewhat startling to find Hector, after his great promises, and his appeal to Glaukos to stand by his side and watch, suddenly leaving the field of it explained why the idea of changing his armour should have thus occurred to him, just after he has sent off Patroklos' spoils to the city. After the passing allusion in 214 we hear nothing more of what we should suppose to be the startling effect of the change; the Greeks do not seem to notice it at all. The me/ga kra/tos which Zeus gives him does not avail him much; for he does not succeed in gaining the body, his chief aim, but only hangs upon the Greeks in their successful retreat. The word metaspw/n in 190 is doubtful, and probably copied from the There Hom. o(plopoii/a. The original narrative is probably resumed in 229, which joins on to 185 without leaving a perceptible u_): da/kruon by da/kru), but no doubt Bentley is right in reading poluda/kruos, cf. 544 u(smi/nh a)rgale/h polu/dakrus.

That passage therefore is later even than this probable interpolation. It is not clear why it should be ou) kata\\ ko/smon to take off the armour of a slain foe \u2014 perhaps because it is of divine origin. For the use of ou)de/ ti the preceding plural clearly shews that the original use of the particle, as the acc. of the relative pronoun, is forgotten. It will be noticed that the above are all late passages; the other instances seem to be confined to the de/xesqaisee on 209 = [3.333] and pa/nta h(/rmosen a)llh/loisin. This sense, too, as illustrating the active interest of Zeus, suits the context better.

The na\u00efve confession of fear is not unworthy of the Homeric hero, and indeed heightens the glory of the subsequent success. Evidently a spurious line originating in the addition of the word *(/ektwr in apposition up to Lucretius' Scipiades, belli fulmen.The harshness lies not so much in calling Hector a ne/fosas in saying that he wraps everything about. The awkwardness is diminished if (with one MS.) we read *(/ektwr d' h(mi=n. An interesting note on cloud-metaphors in Greek will be found in W.-M. on dhmobo/ros [2.547]. The change of person from the 2nd to the 3rd is strange; so is the addition of a relative clause to the formal line 248, and Menelaos' use of his own name. The latter difficulty may be escaped by adopting the variant *)atrei+/dhi *)ag. poime/ni law=n: we do not elsewhere find Menelaos associated with his brother as a public host.

The interference of Zeus, however kindly meant, seems to have been singularly ill-judged; for the Achaians, for whose benefit the darkness is intended, are the first to beg for its removal; see 645-47. The fact is that the darkness from which Aias prays to be delivered is a purely natural phenomenon, due to the dust-clouds arising from the struggle on the sandy plain. We have elsewhere found traces of a desire to produce a striking effect by such supernatural darkness, in places where the effort sadly damages the picture; see notes on of the words is more natural. The adj. may have been added as a gloss, the rest of the line being filled up in a manner which hardly suits the lines immediately preceding, where Zeus' help is given in another way.

In other words, Aineias' willingness is not really made a condition of Hector's hoping to take the steeds \u2014 that condition is already implied in the word kakoi=sin (whether we read tw/ or tw=); the assumption that Aineias is willing to help is added as a matter of course.

There is no change whatever in the designs of Zeus; in 593 he continues to help the Trojans, and he is steadily carrying out his purpose of suffering the Achaians to be again driven to the ships.

The structure is thus exactly the same as in P 658, where it is discussed at scholia remark here and elsewhere that H. does not know the later legend which made Thetis leave the house of Peleus soon after the marriage.

But 153-65 look like an interpolated description of the fight over the body of Patroklos alternative to that at the end of P \u2014 the two accounts can hardly be reconciled, and the general picture has entirely altered. Nothing is said here about the carrying of the body by Menelaos and Meriones with the Aiantes as a rear-guard (P 715-61); the Greeks are dragging it ( e)ru/santo) by the arms, the feet trailing in reach of Hector's hand. Yet Note the extensive variants of Zen., partly taken from the speech of Iris below, 176-77. Ar. objected that Hector's intention is not to mutilate the body, but to exchange it for Sarpedon's (P 160-63, but cf. P 125-26); so that in the mouth of Iris the words of 176-77 are a pious fraud intended merely to arouse Achilles' anger. But in all probability this passage is of quite independent origin from the earlier part of P; such a discrepancy need cause no surprise.

Cf. also This line is not free from suspicion; it may have been added in view of the opening of *q by a poet who thought that Zeus would not permit an open intervention by Iris and Hera (184). It seems to assume that Zeus is still on Olympos with the other gods, instead of on Ida, though this is not necessarily implied. In the sequel, however, there is no talk of secrecy when Athene (203) and Hera (239) interfere personally, nor does Zeus complain that he has been deceived or shew any particular resentment, even if we regard 357-59 as original.

But the change is quite unnecessary. So in 232 Nauck reads a)spa/sioi, cf. e)/pos, while here nothing audible has been mentioned. The words are perhaps a formula of deprecation of unlucky words, rather than a prayer that the thing mentioned may not happen: 'let the word I have spoken be removed from my ear,' th=i boulh=i krath/somen, nu/kta, as P. can hardly mean that they are to debate all night long. Hence it is generally taken to mean 'through the night we will keep our force (army) in the place of assembly,' instead of letting them disperse to their homes. This sense of sqe/nosis not Homeric; the word occurs only in the sense of physical force or in periphrasis, sqe/nos *)wri/wnos.

But this is not inconsistent with the Epic style.) mero/pwn. The lengthening by the ictus is rare at the beginning of the fifth foot; here it is evidently due to the ending mero/pwn a)nqrw/pwn, which might be adapted but was too firmly established to be shifted in place. The five lines 288-92 are a confusing element in the speech, and seem to have no bearing whatever on the situation; they would certainly be better away, for if we omit them the connexion of thought is quite clear, but as they stand, the loss of wealth would appear to be an excuse rather for the defensive than for the offensive attitude which Hector is recommending. dw=ra of The v of kai\\ a)mf' a(/la (from qala/sshi t'. Such a change is unlikely, though it might be explained by the apparent hiatus. On the other hand, there is no ground for rejecting the lines; unlike what precedes they cohere well with the rest of the speech, and it is wisest to accept the neglected v as another indication of the date of all this part. Monro points out that the proper apodosis to 293-94 is 'you wish to retire to the city.'. This is rhetorically suppressed, and in its place we have 'do not make such foolish proposals.' [10.67]. 300-02 are very obscure in thought and expression. The idea seems to be 'if any one (i.e. Polydamas) is nervous about fighting far from the city, owing to the possession of wealth, let him make a present of it to the common store, instead of handing it over to the Achaians, which would be the result of such suicidal counsels as P.'s.' But this elaborate irony is not like Homeric simplicity and directness of thought; the lines would suitably follow 288-92 above, but in another context, viz. in a serious appeal to the Trojans to surrender their private wealth for the common good. The thought in any case is one for an assembly in Troy, not for a council of war in the open field. dhmobo/ros basileu/s Polydamas' words (277) are sarcastically repeated in order to emphasize the contrast of the two conclusions; and so ai)/ k' e)/lqhisi is ingenious but not necessary. Cf. fe/roito for fe/rhisi, and this is adopted by Nauck and von Christ, while Naber conj. fe/rwmi for feroi/mhn. But the text is sufficiently defended by passages like keis inconsistent with the wish. The mood must be potential, 'it might be that I should gain.' The peculiarity of the passage is that the alternative thus hesitatingly put is not that which is most remote in the speaker's mind; for the whole speech, and especially this part, is confident even to boastfulness. It can only be said that the alternative given by the opt. is logically thrown into the background because it is not the one necessary to the leading thought: 'I will face him, even in the expectation that he will win' is followed by 'or on the other hand I might win' only as a subordinate correction. ni/kh e)pamei/betai a)/ndras e)pitrape/ein ktene/onta here also; out such a use of the fut. part. is very doubtful in H., see sense just as we use 'horse' to include 'mare' \u2014 or to speak more strictly, le/wn is the only word in his vocabulary for le/ainabeing a later formation.

Moreover Goebel points out that the order of words (epithet \u2014 poss. pronoun \u2014 subst.) is unexampled. The casual mention of e)ka/monto. As applied to slaves it implies perhaps that they are mere chattels. The act. 'to make' by labour is of course common enough in the act. e)/kamon. It is probable that this is the primitive sense of the word, the sense 'to grow weary,' which alone is found in classical Greek, being secondary. It is curious that modern Greek should have returned to the original sense, ka/nwbeing = ti/ ka/neis; = 344 = P. Knight conj. e)/xeon, to keep up the sequence of imperfects.

Schol. T on this line quotes one of the most curious ancient explanations of the Shield, that of Agallis of Corcyra. This lady held that it represented the early history of Attica, the two cities being Attica and Eleusis. Reference must be made to the scholion for details (see also Schol. A on 490 where the name is wrongly given as *)agalli/as).

For the legend of Orion see The bear is in Arkadian mythology connected with the story of Kallisto, probably a relic of ancient animal-worship ( The idea seems to be that when Orion is rising in the east, the Bear is on the horizon \u2014 which he just touches in North Greece; he then moves upward, as though the coming of the great hunter had scared him from taking his bath. It must, however, be remembered that the Great Bear lay in Homeric days much nearer the Pole than he does at present, owing to the precession of the equinoxes.

[3.318]). The description of the dance stands apart from the rest of the Shield notably in one respect \u2014 that while the previous descriptions shew no local, and hardly even a Hellenic, colouring, the dance is emphatically Cretan. Even apart from the explicit words of 591-92, the scholia tell us that the kubisthth=re (604) and the armed dance were peculiarly Cretan institutions. It has been confidently concluded that the whole episode 590-605 is an interpolation by a Cretan poet. To me it seems that, though this cannot be refuted, the evidence is quite insufficient to enable us to assert it. There is no doubt that Crete was to the Greeks pre-eminently the home of the dance, especially of the war-dance. For this, in addition to *nu/sia *knw/si' o)rxh/mataand still more explicitly Lucian peri\\ o)rx. 8. It is reasonable therefore to suppose that a poet describing a primitive dance would by preference lend it Cretan characters. It must further be remembered that Crete was to early Greece far more characteristically national and important than in historical times. We are just learning (1901) to regard Knosos as the very focus of early culture in the 'Mykenaean' period; and the prominence of Crete tends to lead us as much to an early period as to any thought of late interpolation. We must indeed recoguize that 591-92 are unique in the Shi<*> for their local and mythological all<*>sion. If this is taken as a ground for suspicion, as no doubt it may reasonably be, it can apply to these two lines only, <*>ot to what follows. A few critics, ancient and modern, have been scandalized that a god should imitate a mortal's work \u2014 though this is evidently not involved in the words.

But e)c e)meu= ei)si/n does not necessarily imply actual fatherhood.

The cause of the dislocation can be perceived. The Theomachy of *f has been blended into a continuous story with the fight with the River. Its prologue therefore was dropped. The fight with the River, and indeed the greater part of the battles with which we have now to deal, involve constant intervention by the gods. But after *q had been brought into the corpus of the The second section of the book, 76-352, is well marked, and has all the appearance of an independent \"Aeneid.\" Far from having any special appropriateness to this point of the war, it is glaringly inconsistent with its context. Achilles issues from the camp burning with the fury of insatiable revenge; yet his advice to his very first adversary is to go away \"lest some harm befall him\" (196). In the whole of this speech (178-98) there is not one word belonging to the situation. Achilles is in a merciful and, indeed, bantering mood, and long-suffering enough to listen to the wearisome repetitions, like those of an opera chorus, \"let us have no more talk,\" wherewith Aineias adorns the lengthy Trojan pedigree which he asserts that Achilles well knows already (200-58). When they come to blows Achilles is actually \"afraid\" at his adversary's cast (262), and his own return blow fails of its effect. Finally, after hearing of what \"might have been,\" we find Poseidon suddenly coming forward as a champion of the Trojans, in contradiction of all his policy, and saving Aineias for the future glory of his family. There can, in short, be little doubt that we have here a separate poem with a distinct object. That object must undoubtedly be the glorification of Aineias \u2014 an apology perhaps for the other episode twice alluded to, when he ran away from Achilles at Lyrnessos without a blow. Here he attributes his previous weakness to Zeus (242), and makes up for it by facing his enemy with not unequal courage; he rather than Achilles is throughout the hero. And the curious allusion to his descendants in 307 clearly gives the reason of the interpolation \u2014 a desire to bring into some sort of harmony with the The \"Aeneid\" seems to be a complete whole; doubts arise only as to the \"prologue in heaven\" 76-155, and to some passages in the Trojan genealogy. The latter are discussed in the notes on 215 and 219; with regard to the prologue we can only say that it may well be a later introduction, but that it must have become firmly attached before the wild contradiction with 48-74 could have been allowed to stand. *f. That the last section (353-503) partly consists of the story of the primitive *mh=nis, the beginning of Achilles' career of vengeance, is highly probable. The main question is as to the point where the old work begins. Between 407 and 503 suspicion can attach only to a few short passages (see on 445, 463, 499). But the words of Achilles in 354-63 are, as Hentze has remarked, \"weak and colourless,\" and below the level required by the situation, shewing less energy even than those of Hector (366-72). It is therefore probable that 353-80 form a transition passage due to the diaskeuast who interpolated the \"Aeneid.\" With 381 the original opening of the battle may have begun. Still there are traces which seem to betray a later hand in the following passage. The apparent allusion to the Panionic festival of the Helikonian Poseidon in 404 has caused suspicion in some quarters. But those who believe in the origin of the *mh=nis in Greece proper may take this as a trace rather of the Achaian worship of the god in the Peloponnesian Helike. They will regard with more doubt the description of Iphition's origin in 384 ff., which betrays more knowledge of Asia Minor than we find elsewhere in the older portions of the e)kpaglo/tate. But the point is one for the scholar's private judgment. ka/rh komo/wntes), than a)ko/rhton, though less supported. And it is Achilles' men, not he himself, who might be supposed to have had a surfeit of battle. [11.56], whence the line is no doubt copied.

The scholia assign various reasons for the absence of Okeanos; but Heyne justly remarks that this is less strange than the presence of nymphs and rivers in a council of the gods. He thinks that 7-9 may have been interpolated to account for the presence of the River Skamandros in the Theomachy as one of the gods. It has been also suggested that as Hestia, the personification of the fixed dwelling, alone stays away from the solemn procession of the gods in the colonnades, not benches, as Zen. and others seem to have that the special mention of Poseidon may allude to the bad terms on which he had last parted from Zeus, *l. But if we remember that this introduction really belongs to the Theomachy at the end of *f which takes place in heaven just as the great crisis, the death of Hector, is being accomplished on earth, the words gain their proper significance, and it is needless to seek for any other, such as 'is on the point of bursting out' or 'is kindled very nigh Olympos(?),' or 'has come to a crisis,' or 'now most nearly concerns us' (the gods, Agar in boulh/n. may by a god be used of either party, but shews that the Trojans are uppermost in Zeus' not This probably induced Ar. to write tifor te, but the pronoun is insufferably weak. *ku/klwpos kexo/lwtai It is an old question whether we should read u(pe/rmoron.

It has indeed been proposed to omit 66-74 as an interpolation, so that the actual conflict of the gods will be postponed to the Theomachy in the next book, and the fight between them here, which is announced with so much circumstance in order to end in nothing, will disappear. But 75 prevents this, and shews that the whole introduction to the book hangs together. common N, and O of breaking through an enemy's line or wall. and Nonnos) took the word to mean eu)ru/s.

Bothe by omitting 524 certainly improves the passage, and gets rid both of the sham antithesis pa=si .. polloi=si, and of the fourfold assonance of hke, which is disagreeable to our ears, though we cannot be sure that it was so to the Greeks (there are three rhyming lines in If 524 is omitted, po/non kai/, which merely reinforces the false antithesis of 524. qei=os is not used as a mere synonym of i(ero/s, pu/rgwn ma/la, o)trune/wn. The future part. is out of place in introducing a speech which is to be regarded as the actual representation in words of the action of the verb. klone/ei is equally good. It is not easy to decide between the two readings. Against e)p' a)\\y qe/menai the only argument seems to be the sound. e)pitiqe/nai is the Homeric word for closing a gate (e.g. e)panatiqe/nai is not elsewhere found. Compounds with e)panaare common in later Greek, but the only Homeric instance is e)pane/sthsan a(/llomai, here only; in a(/letai( a)/letai?) correct form answering to the non-thematic a)=lto. The scholia all refer to believe that this silly reason was Zen.'s real ground for the athetesis; the criticism is more in the style of Zo\u00eflos, for whose name Zen.'s may have been accidentally substituted. It is not easy to decide between a)mu/nai. As a rule a)mu/nein takes acc. and gen., a)lalkei=n acc. and dat. On the other hand, loigo\\n a)lalkei=n comes twice besides in this book (138, 250), and we have the comma after it, or we may make it depend as a possessive gen. upon loigo/n, cf. loigo\\n *)axaiw=n, 134. But neither of these is natural; and a)nti/os is generally used of karxar-o/dous, and means asper siti karfale/oi, sfe- danw=n, the latter explanation is the more correct, as sfedanw=n would be intrans., though coming from sfedane/wn rather than sfedana/wn. The contraction is in itself suspicious, and the participle is not demanded by the analogy of 544-45, cf. The reading of the text is that of all MSS., so far as is known. It is true that Hoffmann quotes A C, and La R. A only, for kh=ras instead of xei=ras; but the facsimile shews that this can only be due to some strange hallucination. A, like the rest, has xei=ras, as is correctly printed by Villoison. As kh=ras is found as early as Eust., MS. support may yet be discovered for it; but this will not alter the fact that xei=ras is the only authentic reading. kh=res qana/toio is not an uncommon phrase in H., and in view of the similarity of sound we might expect to find it sporadically here as the result of mere error. Its absence is thus the more significant. We must, therefore, accept the bold personification of 'the heavy hands of Death,' which after all hardly *(/upnwi kasignh/twi *qana/toio in loimoi=o barei/as xei=ras the reading *danaoi=sin a)eike/a loigo\\n a)pw/sei should be rejected. (For the personification of loimo/s in later poetry cf. however, that the metaphorical uses of xei/r are curiously than metaphor. Even e)pixeirei=n and u(poxei/rios appear only in the most literal sense. , We An.find ptoli/porqos as an epithet of Achilles, however, in a(/pac cannot be justified. Apparently the chorizontes argued that Achilles a)na/lkidos ou)tidanoi=o, a)na/lkida fu/zan, etc. This line seems hopeless as it stands. The meaning of *)ileu/s. It is commonly taken to be from *)=ilos or *)/ilios, and explained to mean 'near the tomb of Ilos' (Schol. B, the *trwi+ko/n *)idh/i+on: the correct form of the adj. is *)idai=os, and there is no plain near Troy which can be called 'the plain of Ida,' for Ida is twenty miles away across entirely hilly country. There must therefore be something wrong with the text. Bothe's e)ulh/i+on is a step in the right direction, as substituting a general epithet for a proper name. But by far the most ingenious and convincing emendation is that of van L. and M. da Costa, feu/gw pro\\s was mistaken for a)/n ke, and the second particle dropped as redundant, the defective metre being filled out by turning lei=on into *)ilh/i+on ( *i*l*e*i*o*n). For lei=on pedi/on = *)/idhsin 559 thus gains a meaning which in the existing text it entirely lacks. a)pai/rein is familiar in this sense in Attic prose and verse, e.g. w(s a)pai/rwmen xqono/s mh/ cf. notes on The apodosis is again omitted, as in 556.

So in the next line read de/ v' for (rather de/ ve qe/lgen, because of the caesura) Brandreth. [7.171].

But perhaps we should read a)polu/somai. This giving of gifts to the daughter, if genuine, again shows that Laothoe can hardly have been in an inferior place, or one of which the father disapproved. But van L. is probably right in omitting the line as a late addition. The practice of giving gifts to a daughter at marriage dates only from the end of the Homeric period (see note on [9.146]); and Priam can hardly be expected to proclaim that he looks to his wives' dowries for the ransom of his sons. Hoffmann rejects 46-55, Naber 46-53. As Nikanor points out, this line may be punctuated in two ways: (a) as in the text; (b) with the comma after teqna=si instead of do/moisin. The latter has the advantage of giving a better antithesis to minunqadiw/teron, ' ei)si/n( e)sti/n). This consideration is decisive, unless we are prepared to suppose that the poets of the For e)moi/, which answers better to mhte/ri. fre/nes in extreme old age. This absolute use occurs here only.

The case against ken with fut. indic. is stated by van L. a)/nwith fut. is not found (after a certain amount of gentle violence to the tradition) in Attic, therefore it must be forbidden in Homer; secondly on the fact that in most places where the construction is found in H. it can (again with more or less gentle violence) be conjectured away. A geor tecan generally take the place of ke, me/nof ken, a)/rof a)/n. In cases where the fut. stem is identical with that of a known sigmatic aorist, we can always change - -wntai; the other cases are always ambiguous because of the short vowel of the Homeric aor. subj. There remain only verbs of which we can say with confidence that they have no aorist stem identical with the future. And as the number of these is even smaller in H. than later Greek (e.g. we have a)ce/men, oi)se/men, and perhaps o)ye/sqaias aorists) we are almost reduced for crucial instances to the comparatively small number of futures which have not a sigmatic stem, with the addition of a few like kei/sontaiin 71, which we feel confident cannot be aorists. There are at least three such crucial passages \u2014 e)re/ei w(/s pote/ tis e)re/ei182), kei/sontai de/ tis a)\\n e)rei=looks like a reminiscence of ken; on the contrary it seems so natural that surprise may be felt that it should have been allowed to drop out of use.

The text is punctuated so that oi(being the demonstrative, not the relative. But it is equally possible to remove the colon at the end of 68 so that ou(/smay refer backwards, and to take oi(/as relative and co-ordinate with ou(/s. In any case the sequence is awkward, and is one of various difficulties which lead us to suspect this line at least, if not the whole passage 69-76. Though to be devoured by dogs (i.e. the half wild pariahs of an Eastern town) is the common fate of the heroic dead, yet that a man should be eaten by his own house-dogs is an exaggeration of horror unlike the true Epic style. This may be remedied by excising 69; but much the same may be said of the details in 75, and of the over-violent a)lu/ssontes. There is too a neglect to be copied by Tyrtaios from H.; but the opposite theory, that the interpolator of 69-76 copied from Tyrtaios, is more probable; the lines of Tyrtaios certainly run more smoothly than those of 'Homer,' and they are in all probability older than the Attic redaction. a)lu/w, kei/sontai. a)rhi+ktame/nwi being concessive, kei=sqai being in apposition with pa/nta as the most extreme of all cases. pa/nta is again taken up in 73 and enforced by pa/ntain a very similar way to the preceding kei=sqai, as implying the extreme conceivable. a)rhi+/fatos is in favour of the former alternative.

See note on [13.21]. The two springs are of necessity at the root of all speculations on the question whether or no the poet is describing an actual locality with which he was personally acquainted. Lechevalier thought that he had discovered them at the foot of the hill of Bounarbashi, which therefore for many years held an unquestioned claim to be the site of Troy. But further investigations shewed, firstly, that there were at this spot not two springs but very many \u2014 the Turks call the place 'the Forty Eyes' (i.e. springs); secondly, that to the thermometer all the springs were of the same temperature, whatever they might be to the fancy. Virchow ( phgai\\ *skama/ndroumust mean *mh=nisis a fancy picture, composed of fragments of real geography known by hearsay to a poet not personally acquainted with the locality. The piece of information about the springs is just such as might have been brought home to Greece by campaigners in the Troad; not only is the spot itself, according to the descriptions, one eminently calculated to impress the imagination, but it was in all likelihood the seat of the worship of the diipeth\\s potamo/sin connexion with the ancient cultus of Zeus upon Gargaros. Whether from confusion of the tradition or from merely poetical motives, the poet transfers the source of the river bodily to the foot of the hill of Troy. Ar. endeavoured to evade the difficulty of the expression e)c or a)po/, as though 'springs fed by Skamandros.' This is quite indefensible. The 'steam' from the water may be understood to apply to winter only, as the following qe/rei+ may imply. Such a phenomenon has not been observed at the source of the Skamandros, but would be quite possible in very cold weather with water at a constant temperature of over 60\u00b0 F. z(26) we also find o( me\\n feu/gwn which we should inclined usual, when an expression which denotes a sum is followed by the items, that only the second should be marked as 158 is rejected by Bekker, D\u00fcntzer, and Nauek as a weak and tautological addition.

A triple circuit of the hill of Hissarlik, though a severe course, is by no means an absurd impossibility for a strong man; see Schliemann, ter circum Iliacos raptaverat Hectora muros, w(/soriginally opened a new section of the tale, being followed by 208 immediately; only when the connexion had been severed by the long interpolation was the simile 162-64 added, and w(/smade to refer back to it.

The analogy of klone/wn is used absolutely, leaves no doubt that *(/ektora is to be taken as the object of The only explanation of this passage seems to be that Hector is still running along the wagon-track (146), but that Achilles is taking the shorter but rougher course immediately under the walls. Thus though he cannot overtake Hector, he can cut him off whenever he attempts to reach the gate. For the Dardanian gate see on [5.789]. The fact that the Skaian gate is not named is in favour of Ar.'s identification of the two.

Compare schol. quoted on *yuxostasi/adealt with the death of Memnon, not of Hector.

The idiom by which a certainty is thus expressed, by contrasting it with an impossibility in the form of a wish, is familiar; see *e*i 329-32, and 504.

Others put a comma after a)pala/lkoi and colon after a)/lla (350), thus joining the first ou)d' ei) clause with what precedes, the second with what follows. This entirely emasculates the sentence.

But the change is quite natural; that a large ransom will be offered is likely, but that it should be equal to Hector's weight in gold is an impossible exaggeration and is therefore expressed by the mood of imagination.

This formal line is found elsewhere only in monologues introduced by the phrase ei)=pe pro\\s o(\\n megalh/tora qumo/n, and is very unsuitable to the present context. Heyne thinks that the passage is of importance, as reconciling the obvious duty of Achilles to follow up his success with the economy of the poem, which requires that he should not assault the city. This is precisely the view of the tactical interpolator. It does not follow that the original poet troubled himself much about Achilles' duty as general.

Of the justice of this criticism there can be no doubt; but it is clear that the athetesis does not reach far enough. 500-4 are pointless, except as a contrast to the preceding picture of starvation; 506-7 are a very clumsy addition, and frigid in the extreme.

Heyne suspects this line as a needless expansion; for Thetis is not among the single phrase; or more probably it is analogous to the ordinary adverbial use of the neut. plur. as in o)ce/a keklhgw/s, etc. The difference here evidently is that the adj. expresses a quality of the object of the verb, and does not qualify the meaning of the verb itself. But the logical inaccuracy though real is not unnatural. P.

For 84, which happens to be quoted as in our texts by Plato, Aischines has three lines which are in all respects worse; grammar and thought are alike confused, and a)mfiforei= is a non-Epic form for - h=i+. Generally speaking the quotation \u2014 the longest from H. in any classical writer \u2014 may console us for the loss of these corrupt texts, and warn us against setting ourselves too high an ideal in restoring fragments of new lines such as we find in the oldest papyri. The fortunate coincidence of the citation from Plato answers once for all the suggestion that our present vulgate was made up by Alexandrian critics from these 'praeAristarchean' texts. , Schol.

It may be noticed that this last objection does not apply to the quotation from Aischines given above, though the interpolation of the a)mfiforeu/s is as early as his day; it is doubtless due to the fame acquired by this vessel in later mythology.

Other difficulties are the appearance of Aphrodite, who nowhere else has any special regard for Hector, the effect apparently attributed to the oil of preventing the skin from being torn, and the curious idea that the spot on which Hector's body lies should be hidden, though no such miracle is noticed in *patro/klou in 192 implies that some one else has been the subject of the preceding lines.

With the rel. it is impossible to get a good sense; 321 cannot be taken as apodosis, as it is evidently a mere expansion of 320. We are driven either to suppose that the apodosis is suppressed altogether as sufficiently implied in the whole rel. sentence 319-21; or to adopt pe/poiqe for pepoiqw/s (which has the appearance of a conj.); or to take o(\\s me/n demonstratively with Ar., for which there is no Homeric parallel.

But other indications of this function are so doubtful that no stress can be laid on it (see also on 277, 307).

The neglected v of mh\\ me\\n e)mo\\n su\\ or a)mo/n? see mh/ ti, mh/ me, vekw/n) are highly improbable, as they lose the characteristic me/n of the oath. But no authority on such a point, though T at least has e)e/rshi, which Heyne suggested and Lange has defended at length. The nom. gives no good sense; it is absurd to say that Menelaos' heart 'was comforted like the dew'; it is obviously the dew which comforts the corn, not vice versa. Various attempts have been made to explain the nom.; e.g. F\u00e4si would supply gi/gnetai to the dew on the corn becomes warm or melts.' This will not do, because though the heart of Menelaos may be said to become warm, and perhaps even the dew to melt (evaporate), yet Menelaos' heart does not evaporate nor the dew become warm; so that the comparison fails. Besides i)ai/nw does not mean i)ai/neto khro/s. Ap.

This interesting simile has been satisfactorily explained by Bl\u00fcmner ( mi/tos) being fastened to a beam and hanging down. Each thread was attached (probably by a loop) to one of two horizontal rods ( kano/nes), all the even threads to one, the odd to another. On pulling each of these rods forward alternately an opening between the two sets of threads (odd and even) would be made, through which the shuttle carrying the spool ( phni/on) of the woof could be passed. , Hesych., the spool on which the woof is wound.

The correctness of the conjecture when once made is quite obvious. It is especially important as convincingly shewing that *v was still, at the time of the composition of a comparatively late portion of the poems, an actual independent and still living sound in the Epic dialect, and that the many other proofs of its existence are not, as has been argued, mere metrical reminiscences of a lost consonant ( v'= e(in an inscr. from Metapontum, of which the B well remarks that the three adjectives cover the three great causes which lead men into cruelty; stupidity, e)n koni/hisin), as D\u00fcntzer and D\u00f6d. explain. The word is in either case strange both in sense and formation. The primitive sense of tu/posis the e)ntupo/w= seem to be wrongly repeated from above, for Priam is in the sequel evidently ignorant of any such promise; he does not mention it to Hekabe, nor does he recognize his guide when he meets him; Hermes has to tell his name at the last moment. Those who reject these lines (which were first athetized by Payne Knight) deal in the same way with 152-58; but for this there is no justification. For the sake of the audience the poet makes Zeus announce beforehand that Priam will be safe; but that the old man himself should be ignorant of this heightens the heroism of his journey, and holds the sympathy of the hearer while avoiding the suspense and anxiety which do not consort with the Epic style. It may further be noticed that the substance of 152, the only part of 152-58 which needs to be communicated to Priam, is already given in 171. Moreover, a precisely parallel structure occurs in the message of Zeus carried by Thetis; for she only tells Achilles the end at which Zeus is aiming, but does not repeat 117-19 which tell the means by which it is to be attained \u2014 thus bringing about the graphic scene of Achilles' surprise at the appearance of Priam in person. It is far more surprising that 117-19 should not have been interpolated at the end of the speech of Thetis than that 152-58 should have been added to that of Iris. , Hesych., rightly no doubt.

The poet begins, however, for the sake of adding moral weight, as though he were going to say in the course of saying this he allows the other form of the thought, as the dominant one, to mould the second clause. The difficulty arises from the peculiar construction of the simile in having the point of comparison added independently, qa/mbos d' e)/xei, instead of connected immediately with w(s o(/t' a)/n. as is done in every other simile of this form. The result of the difference is that the minor touches are put in the foremost place, and are continually in danger of overshadowing the essential elements. Schol.

The rhythm of 498 is unusually bad and un-Epic. oi)=os combination of kai/with au)to/sno quotation need be given, as the two words have such a strong affinity that there is a strong presumption against kai/being copulative at all in this connexion.

This famous passage is a typical instance of the picturesque metaphysics of an early age. When the primitive man asks \"Whence come sorrow and joy?\" the answer he finds is that Zeus keeps a store of them in jars in his house; through the accidental opening of such a jar by a woman all ill was let loose upon men, doioi\\ pi/qoi are both jars of ills, and the jar of boons is a third \u2014 e(/teros being used instead of a^llos because the first two are regarded as a unit opposed to the last. According to the other there are two jars only, one of ills and one of boons, so that before kakw=n we must mentally supply e(/teros me/n. This is perfectly legitimate, and is in fact an instance of the idiom found in feu/gwn, o( d' o)/pisqe diw/kwn (for o( me\\n feu/gwn), where see note. Both interpretations being linguistically possible, we have to choose on other grounds. The first has the advantage of agreeing well with what follows; if there are two jars of evil to one of good, we see how it is that a man can at best expect only a mixture of good and ill, and may have no good at all (531). This is in fact the hand Plato took the passage in the second way. Of this there can be no doubt, though the form in which he cites 528 is a rare instance in his works of large deviation from the vulgate. On the whole the authority of Plato and the general construction of the sentence point to this second interpretation as the right one. We must understand from 526 that it is the gods alone who enjoy the jar of boons without mixture of ill. but the gen. of a fem. e(h/, and how this can come from e)u/sno one has yet shown. The hiatus, too, seems to indicate loss of v, which e)u/s, so far as we know, never had. (That this trace of vshould not appear in the other passages is natural enough, owing to their lateness.) Brugmann has suggested that e(h/may = i)/sh, meaning \"a own due,\" gods are \"the givers of men's lots.\" This explanation fails, however, in face of the fact that the present line, which on his view must be due to a misunderstanding of dwth=res e(a/wn, is older than those in which that phrase occurs. The word must therefore remain among the unsolved problems of the language. kammi/cas, which is evidently kai\\ metaphor is a very favourite one in Greek, as will be seen on reference to oi)=strosand its compounds in the Lexica. This gives a good enough sense. Another explanation also found favour in antiquity, viz. that the word meant boulimi/a. But this looks hardly like an Epic formation; and as to the real meaning of the word the late Epics and scholiasts had probably no better means of judging than we. The most important piece of information we get from them is that a goddess *bou/brwstiswas worshipped at Smyrna with a sacrifice of a black bull. If the word really means 'gadfly,' this will be an interesting parallel to Apollo *sminqeu/sand *parno/pios, while a goddess of famine is not a Greek conception. For the formation of the word cf. bou/prhstis, a beetle which poisons cattle. pantelw=s a)/wron a)poqanou/menon, Schol.; a)qliw/taton, Hesych.

Itis curious that so simple a construction should have given rise to difficulties and led to conjectures earlier than the interpolation; e.g. include Dion. Sidon. as appears from Herodianos. This sudden outburst on Achilles' part has been adversely criticised on the ground that Priam's words include nothing to account for so sudden a change of tone. The explanation surely is that the terrible struggle which Achilles is going through cannot be more vividly indicated than by his intense sensitiveness to even the most innocent word which can be supposed to imply hurry or doubt. He must work the matter out in his own way and at his own time, if it is to be carried through at all.

The simple explanation given above shews how groundless is. but kateru/koi is better perhaps than e)ru/saito, which is not elsewhere used precisely in this sense, though it comes naturally enough from that of 'preserving in the breast.' This is expressed in the subj. 587-88 = fa/rea (580) one we may suppose is put as a cover on the bier, the body clad in the chiton being wrapped in the other. Note the hiatus before ti than to any reminiscence of an initial s in *(/ektwr are quite insufficient. Though Achilles obeys the command of Zeus, yet that command itself is conditional upon the bringing of the ransom (119, 137-39); and it is only the receiving of the ransom which enables Achilles to plead that the surrender of the body is not dishonourable. In our ignorance of the Greek rites it is not easy to say how Patroklos was to be given his share of the ransom; but the Some of the costly things would probably be reserved to be buried with his ashes, when taken back to Greece. The custom of bringing gifts to the graves of the dead was as widely spread in Greece as elsewhere, and the Mykenaean tombs shew abundant evidence of the practice. See App. L, \u00a7 8.

We have no means of saying why the folk were turned to stone. The allusion is to some form of the legend unknown to Schol. A, evidently not do, for the gods would not make the folk hard-hearted in order that they might not bury the victims, if they meant to perform the rites themselves. Clearly the folk were in some way involved in the offence and turned into stone in punishment; but the gods, mindful of their friendship with Niobe and her father, did not allow Leto's vengeance to go so far as the denial of funeral rites altogether. There is no doubt a thought of the etymology which, as we know from the Deukalion legend, brought reconciled by the story as given in Apollodoros and the scholia, according to which the slaughter took place in Thebes; the disconsolate Niobe returned to her home in Sipylos, and long afterwards prayed the gods to end her grief by turning her to of e)n can be a)qana/toisi kalo\\n xoro\\n e)rrw/santo. this is a ken, 619) duly mourn thy son.' The lines far from being superfluous thus prove indispensable to the thought. All antiquity knew of the stone figure of Niobe which was still to be seen on Sipylos. It has generally been recognized in a rude figure in front of a recess in the face of a cliff near Smyrna. This has owing to weathering but a distant resemblance to a human being, but that it is a work of men's hands has been placed beyond a doubt by Mr. Simpson, Mr. Sayce, and others who have examined it. According to the latter it is 'the likeness of the great goddess of Carchemish, and the cartouches engraved by the side of it, partly in Hittite and partly in Egyptian characters, shew that it was carved in the time of Ramses-Sesostris himself.' An inscr. of Roman date shews that the figure is 'Plastene, Mother of the Gods.' Pausanias, himself, it appears, a native of the district, describes the figure thus (i. 21. 7.

That the a)oidoi/ were professional mourners hardly admits of a doubt; the custom of employing them is practically universal in Eastern countries, and indeed exists in full force in many places to this day.

Agar ( oi(/ which there is no justification. The various attempts which have been made to bring the following laments into lyric forms cannot be regarded as successful. The first to make the attempt was von Leutsch, who noticed that the lament of Hekabe fell into four divisions of three lines each, of which he made two pairs of strophe and antistrophe. The same principle he extended to the other laments by means of various atheteses. He was followed by Westphal and K\u00f6chly, but the arbitrary nature of the theory is shewn by the fact that they none of them agree on the lines which are to be rejected. Peppm\u00fcller sees in them instances of the ancient no/mos, which was a form of hymn in hexameters generally in honour of a god, though there is some slight evidence that it was used also in dirges. The 'nome' consisted of three parts, the a)rxh/ or exordium, the o)mfalo/s or body, and the sfrhgi/s or epilogue. He thus finds in the lament of Andromache an a)rxh/ (725-30) and sfrhgi/s (740-45) of six lines with o)mfalo/s of nine; Hekabe has an a)rxh/ and sfrhgi/s of three lines each and an o)mfalo/s of six; Helen has the same number of lines for a)rxh/ and sfrhgi/s and seven for the o)mfalo/s (rejecting 772). There is something to be said in favour of this view, as the three laments have some appearance of being formed on the same plan; but our ignorance as to the construction of the nome is such that the theory can be only a conjecture. The contents of the laments naturally give them something of a lyric character. The themes taken by the three are Hector's valour, his piety and its reward, and his gentleness. i(ppoda/moio. Both epithets are commonly applied to Hector, the former being rather the more usual. ne/on. 726-27, cf. au)to/s compare This story of the death of Astyanax was handled by the Cyclics.

The connexion of thought is rather disjointed, as is natural in an expression of violent grief; but the idea plainly is, 'though Achilles' treatment of thee has been so far more harsh than of my other sons, cruel as he was to them; yet it has ended only or because of the evil repute of its inhabitants the Sinties \u2014 o)-mi/x-lh, [1.593]. In view of this derivation the variant o)mixqalo/essan deserves notice. The difficulties in the way of either alternative are obvious; of the two the latter is preferable.

The supposed want of connexion in Helen's words has aroused the scorn of many German editors. Most readers will feel little enough to deride in the speech.
