As a person gets older, their body's ability to form new bone decreases, while its ability to break down bone increases. Losing bone is part of the natural aging process however there are several daily lifestyle practices which may help prevent or manage an individuals' bone density. Hispanolistic / Getty Images Self-Care With Diagnosed Osteoporosis A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is a noninvasive imaging test used to diagnosed osteoporosis. DEXA scans are used to measure bone mineral densities and a T-score of minus 2.5 (-2.5) or lower is diagnostic of osteoporosis. A fracture is often the first sign or symptom of osteoporosis. Once diagnosed, osteoporosis should be managed to prevent progression and decrease the risk of fractures. Self-care practices alone are not enough to treat osteoporosis, however in conjunction with appropriate medications, they can be helpful. Eating for Osteoporosis Eating a well-balanced diet rich in calcium and Vitamin D benefits people with osteoporosis. In addition to other functions, vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium in food better. Good sources of calcium and vitamin D-rich foods include: Dairy products: Milk, yogurt, greens, broccoli rabe, kale Exercise for Osteoporosis Weight-bearing and resistance exercises have been shown to improve bone density in postmenopausal women. High-impact weight-bearing exercises help build bone and include activities such as playing tennis, dancing, climbing stairs. Low-impact weight-bearing exercises have also been shown to help build and maintain bone strength. Well-tolerated activities include walking, yoga, and low-impact aerobics. Muscle building and resistance exercise can also help increase bone density and muscle strength, which can help prevent fractures. Some people may opt to work with a physical therapist ortrainer to help with muscle-building and balance-improving exercises. Self-Care to Prevent Osteoporosis Risks In addition to diet and exercise, other modifiable factors that help decrease the risk of developing osteoporosis include: Limiting alcohol consumption: People who drink more than two alcoholic beverages daily tend to have weaker bones and lose bone density more quickly.Avoiding tobacco use: People who smoke have a greater risk of fracture than nonsmokers, in addition to a wide array of other health-related complications.Talk to your healthcare provider about your prescription medications: Certain medications like corticosteroids, anticonvulsants (anti-seizure medications), and certain antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can increase the risk of developing osteoporosis. Daily Osteoporosis Self-Care Routine Leading a healthy lifestyle on a daily basis can help slow the rate of bone loss in addition to decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and many other common health conditions. Getting the recommended daily amount of calcium and Vitamin D, through supplements, food, or a combination of both is important. Making time to get 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise three times a week is also beneficial to improving bone density. If 30 minutes in one sitting is too difficult, it is OK to do 15 minutes of activity, take a break, and do another 15 minutes later in the day. Summary Osteoporosis is a condition affecting millions of Americans annually. While there are genetic components and certain risk factors that cannot be altered, there are many things that can be done to help minimize bone loss. Eating a well-balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, performing regular weight-bearing exercises, limiting alcohol consumption, and avoiding tobacco products are all self-care practices which can decrease a persons' bone loss. 6 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
