This new NIH U19 Center program will decode patterns of the human immune system and microbial pathogens that result in infections that are not cleared by antibiotics. In turn, defining such patterns will enable new ways to predict individuals at risk of such persistent infections, and inform best antibiotic regimens for cures. The focus of this U19 is on infections caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and the invasive fungus, Candida. These pathogens are among the highest priorities for public health as determined by the NIAID and Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC). Dr. Yeaman and team made previous discoveries that laid essential groundwork for this project to find new ways to prevent and treat persistent bloodstream infections. The new research will take an even more innovative approach to this goal. Traditional genetics focus on the sequence of DNA to identify potential correlates of infection and immunity. The new U19 award goes further\u2014by exploring patterns in how DNA is modified beyond sequence in ways that impact immune response and antibiotic efficacy against infection. This exciting frontier of biomedical research is called epigenomics. Working with Dr. Yeaman will be TLI Investigator Dr. Scott Filler, expert colleagues from the Immunogenetics Center and Department of Bioengineering at UCLA as well as Duke University Medical Center, plus TLI Co-Investigators Dr. Liana Chan and Dr. Marc Swidergall. They will apply powerful immunology and computational methods to detect hidden epigenomic patterns within vast datasets. The ultimate goal of this effort is to accelerate discovery and development of new anti-infective agents, immunotherapies, and vaccines to improve and save lives. The research of Dr. Yeaman and colleagues at TLI continues to be a beacon of innovation. This new U19 award builds upon his recent $10M NIH U01 grant, which assembled a world-class team of experts to support conceptually new research in epigenomics of MRSA bloodstream infections. This new grant adds to Dr. Yeaman's exceptional track record as the Principal Investigator of research projects totaling over $30M in the past 7 years\u2014each of which advances fundamentally new strategies to prevent and treat infections. His new U19 is the only funded NIH Systems Biology Center focused on infections caused by MRSA and Candida.

The NIH Award will Support Dr. Rehan's and Advent's Research to Develop and Position Its Novel Aerosolized Vitamin A Formulation for Commercialization to Prevent BPD. This landmark collaboration has resulted in a significant $3 million Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase IIB grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The funding will directly support the groundbreaking work of Dr. Rehan Virender, which focuses on developing a first-of-its-kind aerosolized vitamin A formulation. This innovative treatment aims to counteract Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD), a life-threatening condition affecting premature infants, with an eye towards commercialization by 2025. Each year, BPD, the leading severe complication in premature infants, impacts an estimated 20,000-30,000 newborns in the United States. This condition imposes not only emotional hardship on families but also a considerable financial burden on the healthcare system. - PARTICIPANTS NEEDED FOR LYSOSOMAL DISEASE NETWORK LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF FABRY DISEASE Study Purpose: The purpose of this research is to learn more about the long-term effects of Fabry disease and the effects of enzyme replacement therapy or other Fabry disease treatments on the kidney and/or the heart and the blood vessels in those tissues in patients with Fabry Disease. Who can participate: Age range 7 to 65 years Has had or will have clinically collected skin, kidney, and/or cardiac biopsies for which tissue can be provided to this study by collecting physician. How long will the research last? We plan to follow you over time and expect that your participation in this research study will last for a minimum of 5 years, but possibly longer. However, you can decide to discontinue participation at any time. What will I need to do to participate? You will not need to do anything extra by being part of this study.

The MFP addresses the health issues of poverty by investing in the financial capability and security of children and families from economically and socially marginalized communities. Funded through grants and private philanthropy, the MFP is at its core a health care innovation tailored to the needs of low-income families and focused on treating poverty as the pervasive health risk it is. The MFP incorporates a new web- and phone-based tool, the Benefits Explorer Tool (BET). The user-friendly BET is an outgrowth of the MFP's four-year success of investing in the financial capability and security of children and families from economically and socially marginalized communities.
