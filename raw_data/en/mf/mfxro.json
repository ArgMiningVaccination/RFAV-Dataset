Hello, Recently, a petition demanding the N.S.H.E. reinstitute COVID-19 vaccination mandates for students gained over 4,000 signatures. As a resident of Nevada and alumnus of the N.S.H.E. who is trained in science and concerned for individual liberty as well as health, I have to voice my opposition to any such reinstitution, and not for my sake, but for the sake of Nevada's collegiate students both present and future. Furthermore, the petition lists multiple statements of dubious-at-best nature. The petition is listed here: https://dpbh.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dpbhnvgov/content/Boards/BOH/Meetings/2022/PC%2048.pdf Let us examine some of the statements made -\"widespread vaccination is the most effective way to prevent serious illness and death and to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" This is false. The most effective ways to prevent serious illness and death have nothing to do with vaccination status. While the exact number varies by country or jurisdiction, typically well over 90% of deaths are associated with comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other serious health conditions. In fact, the vast majority of deaths involve several comorbidities and not just one. Most victims also have deficiencies in vitamins such as D and C. Healthy children, young people, and even middle-aged people are at very low risk of serious COVID-19 infection, let alone death. The best way to improve Americans' outcomes with COVID-19 is not to promote an experimental mRNA vaccine but to increase the percentage of Americans who live healthy lifestyles. Furthermore, multiple studies show that recovery from COVID-19 offers considerably stronger protection than these experimental products. By far the demographic least likely to suffer from infection, hospitalization, and death is not those vaccinated, but those who recover from infection and now have not only antibodies but also robust T-cell responses among other adaptive immune responses. The antibodies produced from vaccination are only useful against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, while recovery from infection provides an immune response to all of the virus's proteins. In addition, recovery from infection also produces mucosal antibodies that the vaccine does not provide. Finally, the virus's Spike protein has evolved since the original Wuhan strain. This means the vaccines are increasingly ineffective against mutated strains with modified Spike. You are vaccinating against something that does possibly not even exist anymore as it existed a couple years ago! It is abundantly clear by now that the vaccines do not provide sterilizing immunity and do not prevent illness and transmission, and how effective they are against serious illness and death over time is questionable. The reasons for this are multiple, and some are touched upon in the previous paragraph, but once again the fact that the vaccines focus on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike means the immunologic conditions on a large scale are perfect for variants that can evade Spike-directed antibodies. The 1905 Supreme Court decision on vaccine mandates said that states can institute vaccine mandates to stop the spread of a virus. Since the current vaccines do not stop viral spread, and not all demographics are at equal risk. There is no reason to mandate these experimental vaccines on anyone, let alone young, healthy people who make up a large percentage of college attendees. Young people are possibly more at risk from the vaccine than from the virus given the elevated risk of myocarditis, pericarditis, and other health issues that have been reported. In fact, these vaccines have more adverse events reported than all other vaccines over the last several decades. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike that the mRNA programs ribosomes to produce can cause extreme inflammation, neurological pathologies, and other complications known and perhaps unknown. These complications should not be ignored; they should be investigated, as a pandemic situation is not an excuse to enforce mandates using vaccines with a questionable safety record. -\"and because the available vaccines are remarkably safe and effective against all current variants,\" I address many issues in the above paragraphs, but I want to reiterate that this is a false statement. If they were remarkably effective, the vaccines would stop infection, and cases now would number much less than over a year ago. Instead, the United States and its jurisdictions, Australia, Israel, Gibraltar, Seychelles, Mongolia, Iceland, and many others have seen record-high cases, and, in some instances hospitalizations and deaths, after vaccinations, vaccine mandates, and even one or more boosters. Take Israel as an example: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/israel/ Israel has seen record daily cases and record daily deaths AFTER boosters! If the vaccines were successful, we should see fewer cases and fewer deaths than in the past, but we do not. During the Delta wave of summer, recorded cases were initially against people not vaccinated, but as time went on, the vaccinated population became a majority of cases and hospitalizations. I would also like to add that populations with fewer vaccinations did not fare worse. Take neighboring countries, all which have much lower vaccination rates: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/state-of-palestine/ Syria COVID - Coronavirus Statistics - Worldometer (worldometers.info) Now, it is true that these countries have lower aged demographics than Israel does, but that does still not explain why Israel's deaths and cases have skyrocketed after widespread vaccination and boosters as opposed to earlier in the pandemic. Either the vaccines are not effective at stopping the spread, or the cases and consequently deaths mirror the number of tests, or both, with the \"both\" option being the most likely. -\"including the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine which has received full FDA approval ( //bit.ly/3enwNM9 ) and is thus no longer experimental;\" This statement is questionable. For one, the FDA approval was for Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty, and so far, there are no vials of Comirnaty available in the United States. Furthermore, if there was an FDA-approved product available, that means all EUA-authorized vaccines (Moderna, Johnson & Johnson) should be withdrawn from the market. In addition, even if an FDA-approved vaccine is available, that does not take away from the experimental nature of the mRNA vaccines. Nobody knows what the long-term effects from mRNA vaccines that instruct ribosomes to build SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins and induce an adaptive immune response will be, and even short-term effects are not fully understood, as there are already many serious safety and health concerns about these treatments (blood clots, myocarditis, pericarditis, Bell's palsy and other neurological conditions, menstrual changes, etc.). Even if it did turn out that most fears regarding the current mRNA and adenovirus vaccines were unfounded, mandating any medical product so soon after they were first used in the general population without any concerns for possible long-term side effects is unethical and also sets a bad precedent. Medical treatments require years of study in order for medical workers to fully understand all potential benefits and risks, and the COVID-19 vaccines are no exception. People need to have informed consent, and that includes both potential risks and benefits as well as the \"consent\" part; people should be free to say, No.\" By instituting draconian mandates, governments around the world are sending the wrong message: that individuals are not capable of making their own health decisions. That is not to say every individual will make the best decision for their own health, but every individual should be free to make the decision that they feel is in their best interest. Every single student in N.S.H.E. should be treated as a free human being capable of making their own decisions. The individuals who signed the petition are free to get vaccinated, boosted and remain masked. However, those individuals should not determine what everyone else does with their body, nor should any government official, either left-wing, centrist, or right-wing. Each individual should make their own decision as to what is best for their health. The liberty of the individual takes precedence over the fears and whims of the mob. As an example, that is why the criminal justice system has things such as due process, standards of proof, and presumption of innocence, because the rights and freedoms of the individual do matter. One does not throw away the rights of the accused to satisfy the desires of the mob or those who have already decided on the guilt of the accused. The United States of America is not a country founded on the idea of government rule being the source of one's safety, security, life, liberty, and dignity. On the contrary, we are a country founded on the ideas of individual liberty coming from a Creator and taking precedence over the dictates of either a government or a government's supporters. Finally, it is not Nevada's style. Nevada is basically a libertarian state founded and inhabited by risk-takers. We should never be an authoritarian nanny state that dictates every detail of the lives and livelihoods of Nevadans. We should be a state of leaders, so let us lead the way as individuals capable of making our own decisions. Nevada needs leaders and not followers, and that includes individuals making their own decisions and being free to reject medical products that they do now want or need. Each individual on the State Board of Health, as well as all of your family members and friends, should be free to make their own decisions. I hope the informed consent, bodily autonomy, privacy, and personal freedoms of all Nevadans, including students, get respected by local and state governments. May you all enjoy the rights, freedom, and privacy each one of you should receive and allow Nevada's college students to remain free. Respectfully, V.M., Nevada resident and alumnus of N.S.H.E.

I am writing in my opposition of mandatory vaccines for students and faculty. I support medical choice! There is NO scientific evidence showing that masks reduce transmission of viral particles. The covid vaccines DO NOT prevent transmission, infection or illness. There are risks associated with these medical interventions; where there is risk there must be full informed consent and free choice. Those who decide to wear masks and/or take covid shots based upon their personal risk assessment are free to do so and if they work properly, that individual should be protected against the virus reguarless if their co-worker or fellow student is vaccinated or not . Medical mandates have no place in a free society and it is quite disgusting that this is even a discussion at this point.

For any or all schools in Nevada. Masks are proven more harmful than helpful, and the vaccines do not stop contraction or passing of the current covid virus. I also strongly recommend there be an OPT- out choice on the DNA submitting of newborns and mothers. And also, i oppose the power being taken away from the county level and giving it to a comity or entity that has no real interest in locals. Thank you for your time.

Please submit an integrated analysis of your cumulative post-authorization safety data, including U.S. and foreign post-authorization experience, in your upcoming BLA submission. Please include a cumulative analysis of the Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and areas of Important Missing Information identified in your Pharmacovigilance Plan, as well as adverse events of special interest and vaccine administration errors (whether or not associated with an adverse event). Please also include distribution data and an analysis of the most common adverse events. In addition, please submit your updated Pharmacovigilance Plan with your BLA submission.\" This document provides an integrated analysis of the cumulative post-authorization safety data, including U.S. and foreign post-authorization adverse eve nt reports received through 28 February 2021. 2. METHODOLOGY Pfizer is responsible for the management post-authorization saf ety data on behalf of the MAH BioNTech according to the Pharmacovigilance Agreement in place. Data from BioNTech are included in the report when applicable. Pfizer's safety database contains cases of AEs reported spontan eously to Pfizer, cases reported by the health authorities, cases published in the medi cal literature, cases from Pfizer-sponsored marketing programs, non-interventional studies , and cases of serious AEs reported from clinical studies regardless of causality assessme nt. The limitations of post-marketing adverse drug event reporting should be considered when interpreting these data: Reports are submitted voluntarily, and the magnitude of underre porting is unknown. Some of the factors that may influence whether an event is reported include: length of time since marketing, market share of the drug, publicity about a drug or an AE, seriousness of the reaction, regulatory actions, awareness by h ealth professionals and consumers of adverse drug event reporting, and litigation. Because many external factors influence whether or not an AE is reported, the spontaneous reporting system yields reporting proportions not i ncidence rates. As a result, it is generally not appropriate to make between-drug co mparisons using these CONFIDENTIAL Page 5 FDA-CBER-2021-5683-0000059BNT162b2 5.3.6 Cumulative Analysis of Post-authorization reporting system should be used for signal detection rather than hypothesis testing. In some reports, clinical information (such as medical history, validation of diagnosis, time from drug use to onset of illness, dose, and use of concom itant drugs) is missing or incomplete, and follow-up information may not be available. An accumulation of adverse event reports (AERs) does not necess arily indicate that a particular AE was caused by the drug; rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other factor(s) such as past medical history or concomitant medication. Among adverse event reports received into the Pfizer safety dat abase during the cumulative period, only those having a complete workflow cycle in the safety database (meaning they progressed to Distribution or Closed workflow sta tus) are included in the monthly SMSR. This approach prevents the inclusion of cases tha t are not fully processed hence not accurately reflecting final information. Due to the l arge numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports received for the product, the M AH has prioritised the processing of serious cases, in order to meet expedited regulatory reporting timelines and ensure these reports are available for signal detection and eva luation activity. The increased volume of reports has not impacted case processing fo r serious reports, and compliance metrics continue to be monitored weekly with prompt action taken as needed to maintain compliance with expedited reporting obligations. No n-serious cases are entered into the safety database no later than 4 calendar days from receipt. Entrance into the database includes the coding of all adverse events; this all ow for a manual review of events being received but may not include immediate case proces sing to completion. Non-serious cases are processed as soon as possible and no late r than 90 days from receipt. Pfizer has also taken a multiple actions to help allev iate the large increase of adverse event reports. This includes significant technology enha ncements, and process and workflow solutions, as well as increasing the number of dat a entry and case (b) (4) processing colleagues. To date, Pfizer has onboarded approximat ely additional full- (b) (4) time employees (FTEs). More are joining each month with an expe cted total of more than additional resources by the end of June 2021. 3. RESULTS 3.1. Safety Database 3.1.1. General Overview It is estimated that approximately (b) (4) doses of BNT162b 2 were shipped worldwide from the receipt of the first temporary authorisation for emerg ency supply on 01 December 2020 through 28 February 2021. Cumulatively, through 28 February 2021, there was a total of 42,086 case reports (25,379 medically confirmed and 16,707 non-medically confirmed) containi ng 158,893 events. Most cases (34,762) were received from United States (13,739), United Kingdom (13,404) Italy (2,578), Germany (1913), France (1506), Portugal (866) and Spain (756); the remaining 7,324 were distributed among 56 other countries.

These cases were individually reviewed and assessed according to Brighton Collaboration (BC) definition and level of diagnostic certainty as shown in the Table below: Brighton Collaboration Level Number of cases BC 1 290 BC 2 311 BC 3 10 BC 4 391 BC 5 831 Total 1833 Level 1 indicates a case with the highest level of diagnostic certainty of anaphylaxis, whereas the diagnostic certainty is lowest for Level 3. Level 4 is defined as \"reported event of anaphylaxis with insufficient evidence to meet the cas e definition\" and Level 5 as not a case of anaphylaxis. There were 1002 cases (54.0% of the potentially relevant cases retrieved), 2958 potentially relevant events, from the Anaphylactic reaction SMQ (Broad and Narrow) search strategy, meeting BC Level 1 to 4: Country of incidence: UK (261), US (184), Mexico (99), Italy (82), Germany (67), Spain (38), France (36), Portugal (22), Denmark (20), Finland, Greece (19 each), S weden (17), Czech Republic , Netherlands (16 each), Belgium, Ireland (13 each), Poland (12), Austria (11); the remaining 57 cases originated from 15 different countries. Relevant event seriousness: Serious (2341), Non-Serious (617); Gender: Females (876), Males (106), Unknown (20); Age (n=961) ranged from 16 to 98 years (mean = 54.8 years, medi an = 42.5 years); Relevant even outcome a: fatal (9)b, resolved/resolving (1922), not resolved (229), resolved with sequelae (48), unknown (754); Most frequently reported relevant PTs (2%), from the Anaphylact ic reaction SMQ (Broad and Narrow) search strategy: Anaphylactic reaction (435), Dyspnoea (356), R ash (190), Pruritus (175), Erythema (159), Urticaria (133), Cough (115), Respiratory distress, Throat tightness (97 each), Swollen tongue (93), Anaphylactic shock (80), Hypotension (72), Chest discomfort (71), Swelling face (70), Pharyngeal swelling (68), and Lip swelling (64). Conclusion: Evaluation of BC cases Level 1 - 4 did not reveal any significant new safety information. Anaphylaxis is appropriately described in the product labeling as are non-anaphylactic hypersensitivity events. Surveillance will continue. a Different clinical outcome may be reported for an event that o ccurred more than once to the same individual. b There were 4 individuals in the anaphylaxis evaluation who die d on the same day they were vaccinated. Although these patients experienced adverse events (9) that are potential symptoms of anaphylaxis, they all had serious underlying medical conditions, and one individual appeared to a lso have COVID-19 pneumonia, that likely contributed to their deaths CONFIDENTIAL Page 10 FDA-CBER-2021-5683-0000064BNT162b2 5.3.6 Cumulative Analysis of Post-authorization Adverse Event Re ports Table 5. Important Important Potential Risk Post Authorization Cases Evaluation (cumulative to 28 Feb 2021) Total Number of Cases in the Reporting Period (N=42086) Vaccine- Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED), including Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Respiratory Disease (VAERD) No post-authorized AE reports have been identified as cases of VAED/VAERD, therefore, there is no observed data at this time. An expected rate of VAED is difficult to establish so a meaningful observed/expected analysis cannot be conducted at this point based on available data. The feasibility of conducting such an analysis will be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis as data on the virus grows and the vaccine safety data continues to accrue. The search criteria utilised to identify potential cases of VAE D for this report includes PTs indicating a lack of effect of the vaccine and PTs potentially indicative o f severe or atypical COVID-19 a. Since the first temporary authorization for emergency supply under Regulation 174 in the UK (01 December 2020) and through 28 February 2021, 138 cases [0.33% of the total PM dataset], reporting 317 potentially relevant events were retrieved: Country of incidence: UK (71), US (25), Germany (14), France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, (4 each), Denmark (3); the remaining 9 cases originated from 9 different countrie s; Cases Seriousness: 138; Seriousness criteria for the total 138 cases: Medically signifi cant (71, of which 8 also serious for disability), Hospitalization required (non-fatal/non-life threatening) (16, of which 1 also serious for disability), Life threatening (13, of which 7 were also serious for hospitalization), Death (38). Gender: Females (73), Males (57), Unknown (8); Age (n=132) ranged from 21 to 100 years (mean = 57.2 years, med ian = 59.5); Case outcome: fatal (38), resolved/resolving (26), not resolved (65), resolved with sequelae (1), unknown (8); Of the 317 relevant events, the most frequently reported PTs (2%) were: Drug ineffective (135), Dyspnoea (53), Diarrhoea (30), COVID-19 pneumonia (23), Vomitin g (20), Respiratory failure (8), and Seizure (7). Conclusion: VAED may present as severe or unusual clinical manif estations of COVID-19. Overall, there were 37 subjects with suspected COVID-19 and 101 subjects with c onfirmed COVID-19 following one or both doses of the vaccine; 75 of the 101 cases were severe, resulting in hospitalisation, disability, life-threatening consequences or death. None of the 75 cases co uld be definitively considered as VAED/VAERD. In this review of subjects with COVID-19 following vaccination, based on the current evidence, VAED/VAERD remains a theoretical risk for the vaccine. Surveillance will continue. a.

Conclusion: There were no safety signals that emerged from the review of these cases of use in pregnancy and while breast feeding. Use in Paediatric Individuals Paediatric individuals <12 years of age Number of cases: 34 d (0.1% of the total PM dataset), indicative of administration in paediatric <12 Years of subjects <12 years of age; Age Country of incidence: UK (29), US (3), Germany and Andorra (1 each); Cases Seriousness: Serious (24), Non-Serious (10); Gender: Females (25), Males (7), Unknown (2); Age (n=34) ranged from 2 months to 9 years, mean = 3.7 years, median = 4.0; Case outcome: resolved/resolving (16), not resolved (13), and unknown (5). Of the 132 reported events, those reported more than once were as follows: Product administered to patient of inappropriate age (27, see Medication Error), Off label use (11),Pyrexia (6), Product use issue (5), Fatigue, Headache and Nausea (4 each), Vaccination sitepain (3), Abdominal pain upper, COVID-19, Facial paralysis, Lym phadenopathy, Malaise, Pruritus and Swelling (2 each). Conclusion: No new significant safety information was identifie d based on a review of these cases compared with the non-paediatric population. Vaccine Effectiveness Company conventions for coding cases indicative of lack of efficacy: The coding conventions for lack of efficacy in the context of a dministration of the COVID-19 vaccine were revised on 15 February 2021, as shown below: PT \"Vaccination failure\" is coded when ALL of the follo wing criteria are met: o The subject has received the series of two doses per the dosing regimen in local labeling. o At least 7 days have elapsed since the second dose of vaccine has been ad ministered. o The subject experiences SARS-CoV-2 infectio n (confirmed laboratory tests). PT \"Drug ineffective\" is coded when either of the followin g applies: The infection is not confir med as SARS-C oV-2 through lab oratory tests (irrespective of the vaccination schedule). This includes scenarios where LOE is stated or implied , e.g., \"the vaccin e did not wo rk\", \"I got COVID- 19\". It is unknown: Whether the subject has received the series of two doses per the dosing regimen in local labeling; How many day s have passed sin ce the fir st dose (includin g unspecified number of days lik e\" a few days\", \"some days\", etc.); If 7 days have passed since the second dose; The subject experiences a vaccine preventable illness 14 days after receiving the first dose up to and through 6 days after receipt of the second dose. Note: after the immune system as had sufficient time (14 days) to respond to the vaccine, a report of COVID-19 is considered a potential lack of efficacy even if the vaccination course is not complete.

Country of incidence: US (665), UK (405), Germany (181), France (85), Italy (58), Romania (47), Belgium (33), Israel (30), Poland (28), Spain (21), Austria (18), Portugal (17), Greece (15), Mexico (13), Denmark (8), Canada (7), Hungary, Sweden and United Arab Emirates (5 each), Czech Republic (4), Switzerland (3); the remaining 12 cas es originated from 9 different countries. COVID-19 infection was suspected in 155 cases, confirmed in 228 cases, in 1 case it was reported that the first dose was not effective (no other informa tion). COVID-19 infection (suspected or confirmed) outcome was reporte d as resolved/resolving (165), not resolved (205) or unknown (1230) at the time of the reporting; there were 65 cases where a fatal outcome was reported. Drug ineffective cases (1649) Drug ineffective event seriousness: serious (1625), non-serious (21) e; Lack of efficacy term was reported: o after the 1st dose in 788 cases o after the 2nd dose in 139 cases o in 722 cases it was unknown after which dose the lack of efficacy occurred. Latency of lack of efficacy term reported after the first dose was known for 176 cases: o Within 9 days: 2 subjects; o Within 14 and 21 days: 154 subjects; o Within 22 and 50 days: 20 subjects; Latency of lack of efficacy term reported after the second dose was known for 69 cases: o Within 0 and 7 days: 42 subjects; o Within 8 and 21 days: 22 subjects; o Within 23 and 36 days: 5 subjects.

Vaccination failure cases (16) Vaccination failure seriousness: all serious; Lack of efficacy term was reported in all cases after the 2nd dose: Latency of lack of efficacy was known for 14 cases: o Within 7 and 13 days: 8 subjects; o Within 15 and 29 days: 6 subjects. COVID-19 (10) and Asymptomatic COVID-19 (6) were the reported vaccine preventable infections that occurred in these 16 cases. Conclusion: No new safety signals of vaccine lack of efficacy h ave emerged based on a review of these cases. a. From a total of 417 cases, 4 cases were excluded from the analysis. In 3 cases, the MAH was informed that a 33-year-old and two unspecified age pregnant female pati ents were scheduled to receive bnt162b2 (PT reported Off label use and Product use issue in 2 cases; Circumstance or information capable of leading to medication error in one case). One case reported the PT Morning sickness; however, pregnancy was not confirmed in this case. b. 558 additional cases retrieved in this dataset were excluded f rom the analysis; upon review, 546 cases cannot be considered true lack of efficacy cases because the PT Drug ineffective was coded but the subjects developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early days from the f irst dose (days 1 - 13); the vaccine has not had sufficient time to stimulate the immune system and, consequently, the development of a vaccine preventable disease during this time is not considered a potential lack of effect of the vaccine; in 5 cases the PT Drug ineffective was removed after data lock point (DLP) bec ause the subjects did not develop COVID- 19 infection; in 1 case, reporting Treatment failure and Transi ent ischaemic attack, the Lack of efficacy PT did not refer to BNT162b2 vaccine; 5 cases have been invalidated in the safety database after DLP; 1 case has been deleted from the discussion because the PTs reported Pat hogen resistance and Product preparation issue were not indicative of a lack of efficacy. to be eliminated. c. Upon review, 31 additional cases were excluded from the analysis as the data reported (e.g. clinical details, height, weight, etc.) were not consistent with paediatric subjects d. Upon review, 28 additional cases were excluded from the analy sis as the data reported (e.g. clinical details, height, weight, etc.) were not consistent with paediat ric subjects. e. Different clinical outcomes may be reported for an event that occurred more than once to the same individual f. In 2 cases the PT Vaccination failure was replaced with Drug i neffective after DLP. Another case was not included in the discussion of the Vaccination failure cases because correct schedu ling (21 days apart between the first and second dose) cannot be confirmed.

DISCUSSION Pfizer performs frequent and rigorous signal detection on BNT162b2 cases. The findings of these signal detection analyses are consistent with the known s afety profile of the vaccine. This cumulative analysis to support the Biologics License Appli cation for BNT162b2, is an integrated analysis of post-authorization safety data, from U.S . and foreign experience, focused on Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and areas of Important Missing Information identified in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as well as adverse events of special interest and vaccine administration errors (whether or not associated with an adverse event). The data do not reveal any novel safety concerns or risks requiring label changes and support a favorable benefit risk profile of to the BNT162b2 vacc ine. Post-authorization Adverse Event Re ports 5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Review of the available data for this cumulative PM experience, confirms a favorable benefit: risk balance for BNT162b2. Pfizer will continue routine pharmacovigilance activities on be half of BioNTech according to the Pharmacovigilance Agreement in place, in order to assure pa tient safety and will inform the Agency if an evaluation of the safety data yields significant new information for BNT162b2.

The cases, observed in Reggio Emilia during the rst 8 months of the vaccination campaign, occurred following receipt of mRNA BNT162b2 (Pzer- BioNTech) vaccine. The AHA patients included two men and two women who ranged in age from 67 to 86 years. During this time frame, 235,597 people received at least one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, the authors noted. https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/251919/bleeding-disorders/post-covid-vaccine-aha-cases-raise-eyebrows?ecd=WNL_eve_220 ... 1/3 In the 5 years prior, from January 2016 to December 2020, only zero to two cases of AHA were observed each year, totaling ve cases, or 1.9 cases per2/19/22, 7:46 PM Post-COVID vaccine AHA cases raise eyebrows in Italy | MDedge Hematology and Oncology Hematology and Oncology million people/year. These numbers are in line with the estimated incidence of the disease, the researchers noted, adding that \"it should nonetheless be underlined that vaccination benets exceed potential side eects and play a central role in individual and public health to eectively protect people from COVID-19 and stop the pandemic.\" However, they also wrote that the \"unusual observation of four cases of a rare disease during the rst months of the vaccination campaign in our province could be of interest and could sensitize health care personnel toward a possible complication of SARS-CoV-2 immunization.\" AHA is a rare autoimmune disease caused by neutralizing autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII. It is mainly associated with malignancy, autoimmune diseases, certain medications, and postnatal status. \"Sporadic AHA cases have been reported in association with infectious diseases or vaccinations,\" the author noted, adding that associations between the BNT162b2 vaccine immune complications, including AHA, have also been reported by other authors. Three of the four case patients in Reggio Emilia had \"at least one common clinical association of AHA,\" they found, suggesting that these associations could \"reflect susceptibility to autoimmunity potentially triggered by vaccination.\" \"Case four died due to complications from sepsis after being treated with steroid and rituximab, whereas the rst three cases underwent clinical and laboratory remission after immunosuppressive therapy, and no relapse has been observed during follow-up, as in the other two cases reported: This could https://www.mdedge.com/hematology-oncology/article/251919/bleeding-disorders/post-covid-vaccine-aha-cases-raise-eyebrows?ecd=WNL_eve_220 ... 2/3 suggest a more favorable prognosis in respect to other non-vaccine- associated cases, but longer-term data are denitely needed,\" they concluded.2/19/22, 7:46 PM Post-COVID vaccine AHA cases eyebrows in Italy | MDedge Hematology and Oncology Hematology and Oncology The authors reported having no disclosures.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine has also received EUA from FDA to provide a third primary series dose to individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise . This Vaccine Information Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the risks and benefits of the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine , which you r child may receive because there is currently a pandemic of COVID- 19. Talk to your child's vaccination provider if you have questions. This Fact Sheet may have been updated. For the most recent Fact Sheet, please see www.cvdvaccine.com . WHA T YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU R CHILD GETS THIS VA CCINE WHA T IS COVID -19? COVID -19 disease is caused by a coronavirus called SARS -CoV-2. You can get COVID -19 through contact with another person who has the virus. It is predomina ntly a respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID -19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported , ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness leading to death . Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle body new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea. 1 You m ay receive this Vaccine Information Fact Sheet even if your child is 12 years old. Children who will turn from 11 years to 12 years of age between their first and second dose in the primary regimen may receive, for either dose, either: (1) the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID- 19 Vaccine authorized for use in individuals 5 through 11 years of age; or (2) COMIRNATY (COVID -19 Vaccine, mRNA) or the Pfizer - BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine authorized for use in individuals 12 years of age and older. 1 Revised: 03 Januar y 2022 For more informa tion on EUA, see the \" What is an Emergency Use A uthorization (EUA )?\" section at the end of this Fact Sheet. WHA T SHOULD YOU MENTION TO YOUR CHILD'S VACCINA TION PROVIDER BEFORE YOUR CHILD GETS THE VACCINE ? Tell the vaccination provider about all of your child's medical conditions, including if your child : has any allergies has had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) has a fever has a bleeding disorder or is on a blood thinner is immunocompromised or is on a medicine that affects your child's immune system is pregnant is breastfeeding has received another COVID -19 vaccine has ever fainted in association with an injection HOW IS THE VA CCINE GIVEN ? The Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine will be given to your child as an injection into the muscle. The v accine is administered as a 2- dose series, 3 weeks apart. A third primary series dose may be administered at least 28 days after the second dose to individuals who are determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise. The v accine may not protect everyone. WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE VACCINE ? Your child should not get the v accine if you r child : had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine . WHA T ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THE VAC CINE? The v accine include s . HAS THE V ACCINE BEEN USED BEFORE? Millions of individuals 12 years of age and older have received the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine under EUA since December 11, 2020. In a clinical trial, approximately 3,100 individuals 5 through 11 years of age have received at least 1 dose of Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine. In other clinical trials, approximately 23,000 individuals 12 years of age and older have received at least 1 dose of the vaccine. The vaccine t hat is authorized for use in children 5 through 11 years of age 2 Revised: 03 Januar y 2022 includes the same mRNA and lipids but different inactive ingredients compared to the vaccine that has been used under EUA in individuals 12 years of age and older and that has been studied in clinical trials. The use of the different inactive ingredients helps stabilize the vaccine under refrigerated temperatures and the formulation can be readily prepared to deliver appropriate doses to the 5 through 11 year -old population. WHA T ARE THE BEN EFITS OF THE VACCINE? The v accine has been shown to prevent COVID- 19. The duration of protection against COVID- 19 is currently unknown. WHA T ARE THE RISKS OF THE VACCINE ? There is a remote chance that the vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the vaccine . For this reason, your child's vaccination provider may ask your child to stay at the place w here you r child received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: Difficulty breathing Swelling of the face and throat A fast heartbeat A bad rash all over the body Dizziness and weakness Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the vaccine. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. You should seek medical attention right away if you r child has any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine: Chest pain Shortness of breath Feelings of having a fast -beating, fluttering, or pounding heart Side effects that have been reported with the v accine include : severe allergic reactions non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) injection site pain tiredness headache muscle pain 3 Revised: 03 Januar y 2022 chills joint pain fever injection site swelling injection site redness nausea feeling unwell swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) decreased appet ite diarrhea vomiting arm pain fainting in association with injection of the vaccine These may not be all the possible side effects of the v accine . Serious and unexpected side effects may occur . The possible side effects of the vaccine are still being studied in clinical trials. WHA T SHOULD I DO A BOUT SIDE EFFECTS?

For more information about IISs visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html . CAN I BE CHA RGED A N ADMINISTRA TION FEE FOR RECEIPT OF THE COVID -19 VACCINE? No. At this time, the provider cannot charge you for a vaccine dose and you cannot be charged an out -of-pocket vacci ne administration fee or any other fee if only receiving a COVID -19 vaccination. However, vaccination providers may seek appropriate reimbursement from a program or plan that covers COVID- 19 vaccine administration fees for the vaccine recipient (private in surance, Medicare, Medicaid, Health Resources & Services Administration [HRSA ] COVID -19 Uninsured Program for non - insured recipients). WHERE CA N I REPORT CA SES OF SUSPECTED FRA UD? Individuals becoming aware of any potential violations of the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program requirements are encouraged to report them to the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, at 1-800-HHS -TIPS or https://TIPS.HHS.GOV M? The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that may help pay for costs of medical care and other specific expenses of certain people 6 Revised: 03 Januar y 2022 who have been seriously injured by certain medicines or vaccines, including this vaccine. Generally , a claim must be submitted to the CICP within one (1) year from the date of receiving the vaccine. To learn more about this program, visit www.hrsa.gov/cicp/ or call 1 -855-266-2427. WHA T IS A N EMERGENCY USE A UTHORIZA TION (EUA )? An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical products , including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID -19 pandemic. An EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service s (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID -19 pandemic. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteri a are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID -19 during the COVID-1 9 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID- 19 pandemic. This EUA for the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 Vaccine will end when the Secretary of HHS determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.

Notes: Caveats: VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination Healthcare providers vaccine https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=FCD50E3D51E3B250B3520D93F192 1/2 3/3/22, 10:37 AM The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Results Form Caveats: VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events, also known as \"safety signals.\" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine. Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, sev erity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines. VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date for which data are available. VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be interpreted in the context of other scientific information. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and Ev ent Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100% in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to unique events is more than 100%. More information.

The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or reports determined to be false are remo ved from VAERS. More information.

About COVID19 vaccines: For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date, see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/ (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/) . One report may state that the patient received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses.

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. NO more vaccine or mask mandates for UNR or anywhere in Nevada! None of these things have proven to stop the transmission of COVID! It's our choice what goes in our bodies not yours! NO newborn blood screening it is unnecessary!! NO mRNA shots for children of any age! They aren't the ones being targeted by COVID and they have proven to damage the hearts of boys and some have died!! Causing also problems for girls! Please think twice before you vote for these!!!!!!! And decisions should be made locally and we should have the freedom to do what we know is best for US!!!!!!

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. Dear Board, First, no mandates period! Vaccines, masks, and health decisions should always be optional. Why force students to put experimental injections in their bodies by force. Freedom should always prevail. In case you haven't noticed, many students have dropped out of UNR and other northern Nevada campuses. The young adults just want to take classes, not put up with tyranny. If students or teachers want to put things in their body, they have the freedom to do so. No one is stopping them. Again, freedom and optional over force! Second, there is no reason for such an intrusive blood sample to be taken and forced on parents to provide. So much can go wrong with this as we have seen happen in California. It just doesn't seem right. Last, health decisions should remain at a local level. Regions, cities, counties, in Nevada are so diverse. Las Vegas should not make health decisions for Reno, and Reno should not make decisions for Elko for example. If we have learned anything over the past two years is that government should be kept small and local otherwise freedoms are squashed. Thank you, G. G. "}
