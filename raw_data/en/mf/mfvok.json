This is the Second Report of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) dealing with Campylobacter . The Committee issued an Interim Report in 1993.1This Second Report comes against the background of a Food Standards Agency (FSA) target of reducingthe incidence of foodborne disease by 20% by April 2006. 2Campylobacter is currently the biggest identified cause of bacterial infectious intestinal disease in the United Kingdom. A significant reduction in humancampylobacteriosis would therefore make a very important contribution toachieving the Agency 's target for reducing foodborne disease. 2. Our Interim Report 1identified strong circumstantial evidence suggesting poultry as a major source of human Campylobacter infection, transmission being either directly through consumption of undercookedchicken or by cross-contamination of other foods in the kitchen. A 2001 FSAsurvey of raw fresh and frozen chicken purchased at retail in the UK found50% of all samples tested were contaminated with Campylobacter (see Chapter 1). 3. We decided in 2000 to set up a Working Group to identify any important gaps and omissions in action taken since 1993 to reduce Campylobacter in food and food sources, and in the knowledge base. Our objective was to develop advice to help the FSA in evolving its strategy forreducing the incidence of foodborne Campylobacter infection in humans. Conscious that the FSA 's foodborne disease target was time-bound, we decided to feed our advice into the Agency as and when it became available,rather than waiting until this Report had been finalised and adopted by thefull Committee for submission to the FSA. Basis for our approach and conclusions 4. As regards the structure of this Report, we have resisted the temptation to chronicle all of the relevant scientific and technical advanceswhich have taken place since our Interim Report was published. Instead, wehave pointed to key developments and where further information maybe found. 5. The various assessments made and the conclusions we have reached reflect, in large measure, the evidence, oral and written, drawn from thescientific community and industry, and from the scientific literature. Therecommendations reflect our conviction that there is an importantassociation between poultry meat and human Campylobacter infection, and our judgement of the practical steps which we believe can be taken acrossthe food chain to reduce the burden of human campylobacteriosis. 1Summary6. More than a million tonnes of chicken meat is produced in the UK annually. Some 96% of this is from intensive production systems. This is onereason why the advice in this Report on measures to prevent contaminationof chicken meat in primary production is centred on intensively-reared birds.Another is that we believe that robust biosecurity regimes are more easilyapplied in the intensive production setting. However, we recognise thatextensive production (free range and organic) is now a significant, albeitrelatively minor, feature of the market and we touch upon this in Chapter 4and Annex E. What we have concluded about Campylobacter 7. The first tranche of advice which we sent the FSA, in September 2002, was about on-farm control measures against Campylobacter spp. in chickens.3An updated version of that advice constitutes Chapter 4 of this Report. We tackled the question of the control of Campylobacter in chickens first because, although we are not 100% certain of the extent of theassociation of poultry meat with human illness, we are satisfied that poultryplays a significant role in the causal chain of events leading to humanfoodborne illness. The human infectious dose is thought to be quite low anda single live chicken could potentially carry millions of human infectiousdoses of Campylobacter . Of course, the microbiological loading may be significantly reduced during slaughter and processing, but poultry meat willstill pose a heavy challenge to hygienic measures along the supply chainright into kitchens, both in the home and in catering establishments. 8. Given the prevalence of Campylobacter in poultry, and knowing how easily pathogens can persist and spread in the domestic and cateringenvironments, we believe that reducing the level of the organism in poultrymeat is likely to make a significant contribution to the battle against humanfoodborne illness. Any reduction in the number of Campylobacter cells reaching the kitchen would enhance the effectiveness of normal hygienemeasures. We recognise that there are other routes of infection and that bothfood and non-food exposure pathways are important. There is also theassociation between travel and human campylobacteriosis in the UK. Wehave given the non-poultry meat exposure pathways some attention in thisReport. However, we believe that the existence of these pathways should notdistract from the need to reduce carriage levels in broiler chickens whichconstitute a very popular food item. 9. We have also afforded poultry particular attention - and made control in chickens a focus for early advice to the FSA 3- because we believe that reducing Campylobacter carriage by housed broilers is now a practical proposition where previously many thought it impossible (see Chapter 4,paragraph 4.4). We do not minimise the difficulties involved, nor the seriouspressures in what is a competitive and price-sensitive industry whereincreased import penetration is a continuing threat. But the evidenceAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 23Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter collected by our Campylobacter Working Group during the course of its deliberations suggests that, on some farms, the problem is already beingsuccessfully addressed. It is also worth bearing in mind that this success hasnot been dependent on great scientific innovation but has come aboutthrough rigorous attention to detail, particularly in relation to robustbiosecurity and through high standards of stockmanship. Moreover, webelieve that these measures not only yield benefits in relation to Campylobacter but are also reflected in overall improvements in poultry health. As such, we believe that they are likely to be self-rewarding. 10. Campylobacter infection of chickens is not a problem peculiar to the UK. It is an issue of concern to a number of other countries, some of whichwere visited by the Working Group (see Chapter 5). The general approach inthese countries to tackling the problem seems consistent with our own. 11. It bears restating that we firmly believe that practical on-farm measures are available now for controlling Campylobacter spp. in chickens. It is very important that industry grasps the nettle of controlling Campylobacter in primary production and processing because we do not regard it as reasonable to expect the problem only to be addressed furtheralong the supply chain by consumers and commercial food handlers. Ofcourse, consumers and commercial food handlers should take all possiblesteps through safe handling, thorough cooking and the avoidance of cross-contamination to eliminate any potential threat from Campylobacter . But hygiene measures should be supplemental to, and not a substitute for,addressing the Campylobacter problem at the beginning of the production, processing and supply chain. 12. When it surveyed levels of Campylobacter in retail chicken in the UK in 2001, the Food Standards Agency found that half of the product sampledwas contaminated. We believe that tackling Campylobacter effectively on broiler farms, and improving hygiene standards at slaughter, could enable2002 contamination levels in retail product to be reduced by at least 50%over the next 1-2 years. 13. Whilst this Report largely reflects the position in the UK, we note that there is significant trade in poultry meat within the European Union (EU),including in product from Third Country origins. We therefore hope that theFSA will explore the implications of the Report in an EU, as well as a UK,context, consulting the European Food Safety Authority if and as the Agencydeems appropriate. We note that, in 2002, the UK imported over 350,000tonnes of poultry meat (around 45,000 tonnes from outside the EU), 4and similar measures to those designed to reduce Campylobacter in UK broiler production also need to be introduced into supply chains where the sourcematerial is outside the UK.Research 14. In order for this Report to be as useful as possible to the Food Standards Agency in developing its Campylobacter reduction strategy, we have focused on short to medium-term practical options for tackling Campylobacter . We have not addressed those research opportunities and gaps which fall into a longer time frame. However, the Working Group will bereturning to the question of research needs, and we say something moreabout this in Chapter 1. The structure of this Report 15. This Report represents the output of the ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group 's deliberations and also reflects the conclusions of our Campylobacter workshop (see Chapter 1). Chapter 1 16. Chapter 1 describes in greater detail the background to our second consideration of Campylobacter , our 2002 workshop, and the link between our work and the FSA 's strategy for reducing foodborne disease. Chapter 1 also explains our approach to research in this Report. Chapter 2 17. Chapter 2 highlights areas of interest and developments in relation to the capacity of Campylobacter to cause disease in humans. We look at genome sequencing, at how Campylobacter responds to stress, and at the infectious dose. We also touch on the debate about the role and nature ofthe Viable Non-Cultural (VNC) form of Campylobacter . Other aspects covered in Chapter 2 are the organism 's pathogenicity, human immunity, acute illness, and the long-term sequelae of Campylobacter infection. Chapter 3 18. In Chapter 3, we look at the epidemiology of Campylobacter and focus, amongst other things, on the disease burden, seasonality, generaloutbreaks, risk factors, and on various epidemiological conundrums. Chapter 4 19. The focus of Chapter 4 is the means of preventing Campylobacter contamination of chicken meat. It is clear to us that control of Campylobacter on-farm is now a practical proposition, at least where birds are housed, and that this is an area for priority attention. Chapter 5 20. Chapter 5 reflects the Scandinavian approach to preventing Campylobacter contamination of chicken meat.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 4Chapter 6 21. In Chapter 6, we look briefly at the question of Campylobacter contamination in poultry other than chicken. Chapter 7 22. Notwithstanding the important association between poultry meat and human Campylobacter infection, we have not overlooked the fact that there are numerous other sources and vehicles of infection. Chapter 7 addressesthe means by which contamination of meat other than poultry meat can beprevented. Chapter 8 23. In Chapter 8, we consider the ways in which Campylobacter can be tackled in the domestic and catering environments. We give particularattention to excluding Campylobacter from the domestic and catering environments, temperature abuse, effective cooking, manufacturers ' cooking instructions, cross-contamination, hygiene advice, companion animals, andfood handlers. Chapter 9 24. Chapter 9 focuses on Campylobacter detection and the most appropriate methods to be used. We also look at the difficult area of Campylobacter typing and suggest one approach which we believe could improve epidemiological understanding of the organism in the next fewyears. We also look at the potential future typing opportunities which DNAmicroarrays may provide. Chapter 10 25. Finally, in Chapter 10, we summarise, for ease of reference, the conclusions we have drawn in this Report and the recommendations wehave made. Annexes, Glossary and References 26. The Report also contains a number of detailed annexes, a glossary of technical terms, and a comprehensive reference section. Prioritisation of recommendations 27. The Committee has endeavoured to prioritise its recommendations along broad lines, indicating those areas where: (a) action is required in theshort-term, to assist the FSA in developing and implementing its Campylobacter strategy; (b) work should be started in the next year or so; (c) work can be put in hand as and when possible, and in the light of competingpriorities. The degree of prioritisation allocated to each recommendation isshown in Chapter 10. 5Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 67Background Human Campylobacter infections in the UK 1.1 Campylobacter has, in recent years, become the single biggest identified cause of bacterial infectious intestinal disease (IID) in the UK.Latest published data for laboratory reports of Campylobacter spp. in England and Wales are shown in Figure 3.1. These show a sustained upwardtrend throughout the 1980s and 1990s, peaking in 1998 when there were inexcess of 58,000 laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter cases. Since then, there has been a significant reduction in laboratory reports which, by 2002,had fallen to just over 46,600. The Report recognises the importance of C. jejuni and C. coli , but uses the term Campylobacter generally throughout the document. ACMSF Interim Report on Campylobacter 1.2 The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) has had a long-standing interest in Campylobacter . 1.3 In 1993, the Committee published an Interim Report on Campylobacter .1Whilst noting that the sources and routes of transmission of Campylobacter infection were not yet fully understood, the Interim Report pointed to the strong circumstantial evidence suggesting one major sourcewas poultry, transmission being either directly through consumption ofundercooked chicken or by cross-contamination of other foods in thekitchen. 1.4 The Interim Report noted that a major difficulty with human campylobacteriosis was that most cases were sporadic and unconnected,making it very difficult to establish the role of different foods. A key thrust ofthe Interim Report was therefore the need for further research andsurveillance on the organism, specifically in relation to typing; isolation andidentification; disease-causing potential; prevalence; and transmission andinfection - to fill gaps in the understanding and knowledge of Campylobacter . The Interim Report also reminded industry and consumers of the crucial importance of effective temperature control, thorough cooking,and the avoidance of cross-contamination; and of education and training.The Interim Report also recommended that all sectors of the food industryshould adopt a HACCP-based approach to the control of potentialmicrobiological hazards.Chapter 11.5 Much of the Interim Report remains pertinent today. A significant amount of recommended research has been carried out, and there havebeen significant advances in what is known about Campylobacter . We point to some of these advances elsewhere in this Report. FSA foodborne disease and chicken stategies 1.6 In 2000, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) set itself 2 targets in relation to foodborne disease, namely to reduce: the incidence of foodborne disease by 20% by April 2006,2 and Salmonella contamination of UK-produced retail chicken by 50% by April 2005.5 1.7 The FSA noted, in its strategy for meeting its foodborne diseasetarget, 6that Campylobacter was the major cause of infectious intestinal disease in those consulting a doctor and the most common gastrointestinalpathogen reported by laboratories. The Agency concluded that a significantreduction in campylobacteriosis would therefore make a major contributionto achieving its foodborne disease target. 1.8 The FSA carried out a survey over the period April-June 2001 to establish baseline levels for the microbiological contamination of chicken(both UK and non-UK) on retail sale in the UK. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 show thelevels of Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination respectively (reflecting the final survey results).7 Table 1.1: Percentage of Salmonella -contaminated raw fresh and frozen chicken purchased at retail in different parts of theUnited Kingdom Source: Food Standards Agency7Category Northern of chicken England Wales Scotland Ireland UK Fresh 4.0 2.2 6.1 1.9 4.0 Frozen 9.8 6.6 16.7 16.2 10.4 All 5.5 3.4 8.8 5.5 5.7Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 8Table 1.2: Percentage of Campylobacter -contaminated raw fresh and frozen chicken purchased at retail in different parts of theUnited Kingdom Source: Food Standards Agency7 1.9 Having completed a preliminary analysis of the results from its survey, the FSA decided that, while the work on Salmonella reduction would continue, the reduction of Campylobacter in chickens should be afforded higher priority.8 1.10 As noted above, the long-standing view of the ACMSF has been thatchickens are a major source of Campylobacter . The Committee believes that reducing the number of Campylobacter -positive chickens on retail sale and going into catering will make an important contribution to the reduction ofhuman Campylobacter infections. 1.11 While the Food Standards Agency 's foodborne disease strategy recognised poultry production as an obvious sector for attempting to control Campylobacter , it also drew attention to the possible contribution of raw meat as a source of organisms which cross-contaminate other foods. Thefoodborne disease strategy also highlighted the contribution which milk anddairy sector controls could make to the control of a range of pathogensincluding Campylobacter . Hygiene initiatives in the red meat and dairy sectors were seen as a useful means of reducing cases ofcampylobacteriosis, as were improving food hygiene in catering and in thehome, focussing on thorough cooking and the prevention of cross-contamination. 9 Campylobacter revisited by ACMSF 1.12 In 2000, the ACMSF decided to revisit Campylobacter , and to establish a formal Working Group for this purpose, with a view to identifyingmeans of reducing the incidence of Campylobacter infections in humans. The Working Group's terms of reference were to identify any important gaps and omissions in action taken to reduce Campylobacter in foodand food sources and in the knowledge base; and to develop advicewhich would assist the Food Standards Agency in evolving its strategyfor reducing the incidence of foodborne Campylobacter infection inhumans. Membership of the Working Group, and the full ACMSF , is shown in Annex A. Written and oral evidence was taken from a range of interestedparties.

Advice was submitted to the FSA in September 2002 on controlof Campylobacter in broiler flocks,3and a report was made to the Agency in January 2003 on the visit by members of the Campylobacter Working Group to Denmark and Norway (Annex C). ACMSF Campylobacter workshop 1.14 As a precursor to the first meeting of the ACMSF 's Campylobacter Working Group, the Committee held a Campylobacter workshop at the Britannia International Hotel in London Docklands in February 2002. Thiswas attended by ACMSF Members and by invited experts from the UK andEurope. The workshop had 3 broad objectives, namely to: take stock of research findings both in the UK and elsewherein the World; identify any major gaps in knowledge justifying on-goingresearch; and decide, on the basis of current knowledge, whether there werefood chain interventions which would reduce consumerexposure to Campylobacter and suggestions which would assist the FSA to achieve its foodborne disease and chickenmeat microbiological contamination reduction targets. 1.15 The workshop proved very useful in helping identify a number of lines of thought and enquiry which participants felt would benefit the work of the Campylobacter Working Group. The following conclusions were drawn from the workshop discussion: typing and detection: there was a need for detection and typing methods to be adopted which were applicable acrossclinical, veterinary, environmental and food isolates. Progresswas being made but differences remained which werehindering investigations; the immune status of the population: significant uncertainties remained on human vulnerability and immunity to Campylobacter infection; pathogenesis: it remained unclear whether all campylobacters were pathogenic to humans. There was a need for a robustanimal model with surrogate markers for virulence.Investigation of pathogenesis was regarded as very importantAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 1011Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter and it was considered that, for this purpose, identification of non-pathogenic strains would be very useful; origins and transmission: there was a need to clarify origins of infection and routes of transmission. Targeted case-controlstudies would be essential in examining the importance ofwater and \"travel \" exposure pathways; genomics: the use of genomics was thought likely to yield general benefits in the longer-term. It was felt, however, thatthe exploitation of genome sequence data using microarraysmight be useful for targeted research in the shorter-term; seasonality: the importance of seasonality needed to be assessed. The apparent seasonal increase in Campylobacter might reflect a combination of factors, eg. general environmental loading and the response to highertemperatures; animals being turned out to pasture; etc; freezing: it was noted that freezing of chicken carcasses served to reduce campylobacters on poultry meat by orders ofmagnitude. This contrasted with the situation in relation to Salmonella which was noted as being less sensitive to freezing; irradiation: irradiation of carcasses was an option available for reducing Campylobacter contamination of poultry meat but there was likely to be a high level of consumer resistance; risk assessment: the contribution of quantitative risk assessment needed to be borne in mind; food and water exposure pathways: there was strong evidence that poultry meat was an important source of humancampylobacteriosis. However, the importance of foods otherthan poultry meat needed to be examined, as did theprevalence of the organism in finished foods and its responseto processing. Given the organism 's ubiquity in the environment, there was a need to focus on the contribution tohuman infection made by salads, sewage sludge and otherorganic wastes used in agriculture, and irrigation water. Itwould also be important to clarify the importance of humanexposure through public water supplies; food chain interventions: it was considered essential to be able to identify intervention points to reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter at various stages of the food chain. This, it was felt, would help get the organism out of raw foodmaterials and thus ensure that measures taken to reduce the risk in the kitchen (eg. avoiding cross-contamination,appropriate storage and handling, thorough cooking) wereincremental. By focusing on good and bad practices in poultrymeat production, it should be possible to identify key,reproducible interventions. The role of general health inpredisposing birds to colonisation needed to be investigated.It was noted that intensive and extensive production systemswere likely to pose different problems in terms of control.However, a number of measures like pre-slaughter testing, andthe scheduling of slaughter to reflect the disease status ofbirds, were likely to be helpful in both production settings. 1.16 Details of participants in the workshop, and of the presentations made, are also included in Annex A. Scientific progress and research 1.17 More is known about Campylobacter now than at the time our Interim Report1was published in 1993. Much of this increased knowledge reflects the results of research undertaken in response to the recommendations inour Interim Report. We have not attempted, in our latest Report, to chroniclethese advances in detail. Rather, we have endeavoured to signpostdevelopments and where information about them can be found. 1.18 The purpose of this Report is to assist the FSA in its strategy for combating Campylobacter infections in humans and hence is focused on the short to medium-term. The importance of getting our Report to the FSA asearly as possible has been a constant feature of our deliberations. We havethus not dealt with research opportunities and needs where there aresignificant gaps in knowledge, such as those discussed at our workshop. 1.19 Despite the scientific advances made, Campylobacter remains a poorly characterised microorganism and this impacts on its epidemiologyand control. There is therefore a need for continued fundamental research,especially in the area of functional genomics. As noted earlier, the focus ofthis Report has been on the practical measures which will help the FSAdevelop its strategy for tackling Campylobacter in the shorter-term. However, the ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group will meet again with the aim of identifying where research outputs, had they been available, would havecontributed to progressing the objectives identified as desirable in thisReport more quickly. It should be recognised that any research requirementsidentified through this planned review can only yield results in the medium tolonger-term, given the time lag involved between identifying research andbeing able to apply practical outputs. Acknowledgements 1.20 The Committee wishes to express its appreciation for the views and assistance it has received from all of the organisations detailed in Annex B.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 12The Organism, Human Immune Response and Pathogenesis Introduction 2.1 There has been an immense amount of work on these aspects since the publication of our Interim Report on Campylobacter .1This has led to a much greater understanding of the organism, how it grows and survives, andhow it causes illness. However, there are still issues to be resolved, and it isclear that further work may be required to fully understand the threat theorganism poses to the foodchain. It is not intended that this Chapter shouldprovide a definitive text on issues such as Campylobacter genetics, physiology and pathogenesis. Rather, it is intended to summarise the currentstate of knowledge and highlight areas of interest. Genome sequencing 2.2 The publication of the genome sequence of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168 in 200010 was a major breakthrough in Campylobacter research. This strain of C. jejuni has a chromosome of 1,641,481 base pairs, which is relatively small compared to other bacteria, and is predicted to encode for1,654 proteins and 54 stable RNA species. With 94.3% of the genomecoding for proteins, this is one of the densest bacterial genomes (if not thedensest) sequenced to date. It is unusual in that there are very few insertionor phage-associated sequences and an almost complete lack of repetitiveDNA sequences (only 4 repeated sequences within the entire genome). of hypervariable sequences, commonly found in genes encodingthe biosynthesis or modification of surface structures, is important. Asurprising feature is that, with few exceptions, there seems to be minimalorganisation of genes into operons or clusters. 2.3 The sequencing information has helped to identify the location and function of a variety of C. jejuni genes and has started to provide an insight into the metabolism of the organism, the virulence factors important in itspathogenesis, and its survival strategies. The size of the chromosome meansthat the number of genes is limited (around 1,600 compared to over 5,000 in Salmonella) and this might explain why Campylobacter has fastidious growth requirements. Further, the high rate of variation in the hypervariablesequences could explain how genetic traits are altered in C. jejuni populations and also how the organism is able to survive in changing environmental conditions. 13Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter Chapter 22.4 The genome sequence of C. jejuni NCTC11168 may lack important genes. Whilst it may thus be considered as a valuable reference point forpost-genomic analysis, there is a need to examine the DNA sequences ofadditional strains in order to approach a definitive view of the Campylobacter genome. Already work on other strains of C. jejuni has shown striking differences in the content, position and arrangement of mapped genes.11 Responses to stress 2.5 There is debate as to the extent to which Campylobacter is sensitive to environmental stresses. A long-held view is that the organism is unusuallysensitive, and there is no doubt that Campylobacter appears to lack many adaptive responses which can be correlated with resistance in otherbacteria. For example, analysis of the genome indicates that the organismdoes not possess the RpoS global regulator 10which, in a number of Gram- negative organisms, is the basis for the survival of the bacterial cell instationary phase and during exposure to many types of environmental stress.Recent work has shown, however, that C. jejuni can mount adaptive responses to both acidic and aerobic conditions,12,13and there is increasing recognition that Campylobacter is more resistant to stress than had initially been thought. One theory is that the methods used to assess survival havecaused confusion. 14Because the methods have not been optimised for the recovery of damaged cells, they have provided the opportunity for anoverestimation of sensitivity. Response to high temperature 2.6 Although thermophilic in nature, campylobacters are readily inactivated by heat and do not survive pasteurisation treatments or typicalcooking procedures. The organism does exhibit a heat shock response, withat least 24 proteins being preferentially synthesised by C. jejuni immediately after exposure to temperatures above that which is optimal for growth.15The response mechanism is still being investigated, but it appears to be differentto those seen in other bacteria. It has been suggested that the heat shockresponse may play a role in both thermotolerance and colonisation, asmutants deficient in one of the heat shock proteins have severely reducedgrowth at 46 \u00b0C and are unable to colonise chickens. 15 Response to low temperature 2.7 Campylobacter jejuni does not appear to produce cold shock proteins,10which may explain why it cannot grow below 30oC. Unlike other bacteria, which show a gradual reduction in growth rate near their minimalgrowth temperature, C. jejuni shows a rapid decline.16However, at temperatures as low as 4oC, the organism can respire, generate ATP , and move towards favourable environments, although it is unable to replicate.16 At lower temperatures, viability is lost rapidly but the organism can still beisolated from frozen meats and poultry products. 17Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 14Response to oxidative stress 2.8 Most Campylobacter spp. are microaerophilic, although a few species have now been found to grow under strictly aerobic or anaerobicconditions. 18Those that are microaerophilic, which includes the main species linked to foodborne disease, have an inherent sensitivity towardsoxygen and its reduction products, and require cellular defences for survivalduring exposure to air. Oxidative stress has been shown to contribute to thefreeze-thaw induced killing of Campylobacter .19 Response to osmotic stress 2.9 Many bacteria have regulatory mechanisms which enable them to resist osmotic stress, for example through the synthesis or transport ofcompatible solutes. Such systems appear to be absent in Campylobacter,10 and this may explain why the organism is relatively sensitive to osmotic stress. That said, there is evidence that the organism can be recovered fromdry surfaces 24 hours after contamination, albeit in low numbers. 14 Response to stationary phase and starvation 2.10 For many bacteria, entry into the stationary phase, eg. following starvation, is accompanied by profound structural changes which result inincreased resistance to heat shock, oxidative, osmotic and acid stresses. 20 This change is commonly mediated by RpoS. However, as already noted,this system does not appear to be present in Campylobacter . In fact, it has been reported that the organism exhibits the opposite response to manyother bacteria. Indeed, it has been observed that stationary phase culturesof C. jejuni are more sensitive to mild heat stress and oxidative stress than those containing exponential phase cells.21 The debate on coccoid cells and Viable Non-Culturable (VNC) Campylobacter 2.11 There is still debate about the role and nature of the so-called Viable Non-Culturable (VNC) form of Campylobacter . This concept was introduced in the mid 1980s, with reports that C. jejuni changed form from a culturable spiral to a non-culturable coccoidal structure. It was suggested that this wasa dormant state that helps Campylobacter survive in hostile environments.22 Since then, questions have been raised about whether non-culturability equates to non-viability,23whether it is possible to revert the VNC form to a culturable form,24-27and, indeed, whether a VNC form of Campylobacter actually exists. As it has been demonstrated that only a limited number of isolates form the VNC stage,28the view that the existence of a VNC form may simply be due to strain differences has also been advanced.29 2.12 Another view is that the coccoid form is merely a degenerative form ofthe spiral, 30especially as its formation is not prevented by the inhibition of 15Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterprotein synthesis or DNA replication.31However, the observation that different types of cocci form in response to different temperatures suggeststhat the situation may be more complicated. 31It has also been suggested that, under stress conditions, young spiral cells form coccoids, whereas theolder spiral cells show degenerative changes. 26 Infectious dose 2.13 The Campylobacter infectious dose is thought to be very low (<500 bacterial cells). Very few data are available from outbreaks, and studies todetermine the exact number of cells that will cause human infection haveproved inconclusive, although examination of a bottle of bird-pecked milk,which was part of a batch implicated in an outbreak at a nursery, revealedcontamination levels of less than 10 cells of C. jejuni per 100 ml.32 Pathogenicity 2.14 Whilst the mechanism of Campylobacter infection in humans is still not fully understood, some of the factors essential for pathogenesis have nowbeen identified. Infection appears to include at least two stages namely, theorganism adhering to the intestine of the animal and producing toxin, theninvading and proliferating within the intestinal mucosa. 29Motility is thought to contribute significantly to both colonisation and the development ofdisease, 33and understanding of how this works is increasing, genes having been identified for regulatory components of a chemotaxis system andcandidate receptors for signal detection. 10It has also been shown that one of the flagellin subunit proteins is important for adhesion to host cells.34 2.15 The function and role of toxins in pathogenesis is yet to be fullyelucidated and remains a topic of debate. A variety of toxins has beenreported, 35-37many of which are similar to those found in some other bacteria, including one apparently related to the cholera toxin35(the existence of which is controversial, not least because it does not appear tobe encoded on the genome 10). A cytotoxin thought to be involved in pathogenesis, cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), has been identified in C. jejuni ,38although its precise function has yet to be determined. 2.16 Invasion mechanisms also remain poorly understood, although there is recent evidence to suggest that they are strain-specific.39Flagella-mediated motility is thought to be a major contributing factor,34with invasion likely to involve changes to the host cell membrane and/or the internal cytoskeletalstructure. 40Campylobacter jejuni secretes proteins which are felt to be essential for internalisation of the organism into mammalian cells, thesebeing synthesised during interaction with epithelial cells. 41Following invasion, C. jejuni appears to be largely confined to membrane-bound vacuoles, although some organisms have been detected free in thecytoplasm. 40Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 162.17 The mechanism by which Campylobacter causes diarrhoea is becoming understood, although it is apparent that various hosts reactdifferently to invasion, with fluid secretion being dependent on the extent ofthe host response and degree of epithelial damage. 18The process of cell adhesion, internalisation and movement of the organism across host cells,attracts white blood cells to the site of infection, and granules released bythese cells during Campylobacter phagocytosis cause tissue damage, inflammation and, ultimately, diarrhoea.18 (See paragraph 3.3) Immunity 2.18 There is a view that vaccination may be a possible control option, as infected people mount a strong immune response. In addition, immunityagainst Campylobacter is possible, in the absence of acute infection, with many abattoir workers apparently being immune to infection after initialexposure. 42There have also been attempts to develop Campylobacter vaccines, whole-cell oral vaccine formulations having been tested with good results in primates,43and a vaccine based on whole-cell formulations and a purified flagellin giving some protective immunity in the mouse model.44 The acute illness 2.19 Clinical features of acute Campylobacter infection vary from mild diarrhoea lasting 24 hours to severe illness lasting more than a week. Theincubation period is typically 2 to 5 days, although can be up to 11 days, withthe onset of diarrhoea (which is often blood-stained) being preceded bymalaise and, possibly, fever. Characteristic of campylobacteriosis is apersistent colicky abdominal pain which may mimic acute appendicitis.Other symptoms which may be present are headache, backache, aching ofthe limbs and nausea. However, vomiting is uncommon. Long-term sequelae of Campylobacter infection 2.20 Long-term sequelae of Campylobacter infection include neurological, rheumatological and renal problems. Guillain-Barr \u00e9 syndrome 2.21 The association between Campylobacter infection and subsequent Guillain-Barr \u00e9 syndrome (GBS), as well as the related Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), is well documented. Guillain-Barr \u00e9 syndrome is an acute, bilateral, ascending paralysis occurring typically 1-3 weeks following onset ofdiarrhoea. 45The association appears to be restricted to infection with C. jejuni species, which is the most commonly reported infectious trigger for GBS. 2.22 The prevalence of C. jejuni infection among GBS cases, based mostly on serology, ranges from 15% to 66%, compared with between 0% and 17%among controls in various settings. 46-56 17Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter2.23 Preceding Campylobacter infection appears to be associated with more severe neurological symptoms, slower recovery, and poorer outcomefrom GBS after one year. 46Particular C. jejuni serotypes, namely O:1955and O:41,57have been implicated in the development of GBS in certain settings. 2.24 The most reliable estimate of GBS incidence is from Sweden, where laboratory reports of C. jejuni infection were linked with cases of GBS identified through the Swedish Inpatient Register.58This yielded an estimate of 30.1 cases of GBS per 100,000 cases of C. jejuni IID for the two-month period following infection. 2.25 By applying this estimate to England figures, it has been estimated that 15 hospital admissions due to GBS occur among laboratory-confirmedcases of C. jejuni IID in a 12-month period.59However, this estimate takes into account solely those cases of C. jejuni IID that are reported to national surveillance (only a tenth of all cases in the community).60Assuming the risk of GBS is the same among both reported and unreported cases, theexpected number of C. jejuni -associated GBS hospitalisations over a 12- month period rises to 157, representing nearly 15% of all GBS admissions inEngland. 59 Post infection arthropathies 2.26 Campylobacter has been associated with a range of rheumatological conditions, most commonly reported as reactive arthritis (ReA), defined hereas an aseptic arthritis following an enteric infection. 2.27 Campylobacter -induced ReA occurs an average of two weeks following onset of diarrhoea.61,62 The condition typically affects more than one joint, most commonly the knees, ankles, wrists and lower back. Theaverage duration of arthritic symptoms is approximately two months. 62A predominance of the HLA-B27 genotype has been described among casereports of Campylobacter -associated ReA,61,62 although this may not be the case in the population setting.63 2.28 Follow-up of cases from large outbreaks of Campylobacter IID have yielded estimates of subsequent ReA of between 0.6% and 1.1%.64,65 However, these estimates are likely to be biased by losses to follow-up, thelack of an appropriate control group, and the fact that outbreak cases mightbe atypical in terms of their epidemiology and/or microbiology. 2.29 Retrospective follow-up of 210 Campylobacter patients presenting to general practice in Denmark yielded a probable ReA frequency of 15%.66 2.30 A prospective study of 870 laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter IID cases and 1,440 population controls in Finland yielded a ReA frequency of7%, diagnosed by clinical examination (0% among population controls). 63Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 182.31 Despite using slightly different definitions of ReA, in both studies the median interval between onset of diarrhoea and occurrence ofrheumatological symptoms was two weeks. Females predominated amongReA cases, and young adults and the middle-aged were most commonlyaffected. ReA occurred in both C. jejuni and Campylobacter coli patients and was associated with longer duration of diarrhoeal symptoms. 2.32 Applying the Finnish estimate to England and Wales surveillance figures, an estimated 3,961 episodes of ReA would be expected among the56,592 laboratory-confirmed cases of Campylobacter IID reported to the Public Health Laboratory Service (now the Health Protection Agency)Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in 2001. Assuming thatan incidence of 7% also applies to non-reported cases of Campylobacter IID, and accounting for under-reporting to national surveillance,60up to 40,802 episodes of ReA might have resulted from symptomatic Campylobacter infection in England and Wales in 2001. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome 2.33 Evidence for a link between haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and preceding Campylobacter infection comes from individual case reports. Preceding infection with C. jejuni67-70 and, to a lesser extent, Campylobacter upsaliensis71in the absence of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) has been implicated. To date, no systematic follow-up study of Campylobacter IID patients for occurrence of HUS has been carried out, and no data on the frequency of this complication are available. Conclusions 2.34 The debate about the role, indeed the very existence, of the VNC form of Campylobacter seems unlikely to be resolved in the short-term. It is a complex area and not one where we have been able to draw any firmconclusions. However, we are not aware of any evidence to suggest thatcurrent uncertainties give cause for concern in relation to food safety. We arenot, therefore, recommending that the FSA should commit funds to furtherresearch on the VNC issue. We note that the research community continuesto carry out work in this area. This should be monitored and we hope that aconsensus view will eventually emerge. 2.35 Campylobacter isolation methods have been improved since much of the work on VNC was performed, and it is now possible to recover cellspreviously thought to be non-culturable. What is not yet clear is whether veryhighly damaged cells of Campylobacter now recoverable from a variety of environments, and after a variety of treatments, pose an infection threat. 19Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter2.36 It is clear that infectious intestinal disease causes a considerable burden of ill health over and above the initial event. However, littleinformation is available on the incidence and economic cost of long term sequelae and it would be useful to have a more reliable measure. Recommendations 2.37 We recommend that the Government should instigate a primary care-based sentinel surveillance system, aimed at measuring directlythe incidence and economic cost of long-term sequelae among cases of Campylobacter infectious intestinal disease. (Priority B) 2.38 We recommend that serological markers for recent infection and prior immunity be developed and tested through structured,epidemiologically robust, population-based studies. This should assistwith estimating the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in thepopulation (and hence estimating more accurately the magnitude of Campylobacter -associated sequelae ). (Priority C)Advisory Committee on of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 20Campylobacter Epidemiology Introduction 3.1 Although campylobacters emerged as important pathogens more than 20 years ago, their epidemiology is still poorly understood. One of theperceived difficulties was the lack of routine microbiological characterisationof clinical strains. 72This has militated against a systematic study of the epidemiology of the different species and sub-types of Campylobacter . Developing and targeting control and prevention strategies is impossiblewithout a proper understanding of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection. 3.2 On 1 May 2000, the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) - now the Health Protection Agency - launched an active, sentinel, population- based surveillance scheme for Campylobacter infections in England and Wales - the Campylobacter Sentinel Surveillance Scheme (CSSS).73,74The aim was to generate hypotheses for human Campylobacter infection using a systematic, integrated epidemiological and microbiological approach.Twenty-two District Health Authorities (DHAs), chosen for their geographicalrepresentativeness, collaborated in the three-year scheme, working withtheir hospital microbiology and local authority environmental healthdepartments. The sentinel system covered a population of approximately12.5 million people. Campylobacters isolated by National Health Service andPHLS laboratories within the DHA catchment referred all their isolates to the Campylobacter Reference Unit (CRU) of the PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP) for detailed strain characterisation. A standard, structuredclinical and risk factor questionnaire was administered to the patient by therelevant Health or Local Authority as part of their routine investigation offoodborne infection. The Gastrointestinal Diseases Division of the PHLSCommunicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) then collatedepidemiological exposure data and microbiological typing informationcentrally. The scheme captured standardised information on approximately15% of all laboratory confirmed Campylobacter infections in England and Wales between 1 May 2000 and 30 April 2003. Disease burden 3.3 Campylobacter is the most commonly reported bacterial cause of gastroenteritis in the developed world. Figure 3.1 shows the trend inlaboratory reporting in England and Wales since 1977. In 1998, the peakyear, 58,059 laboratory confirmed cases in England and Wales were reportedto the CDSC. 75Data from the CSSS show that approximately 20% of 21Chapter 3Campylobacter cases have travelled abroad in the fortnight before illness onset.76 Figure 3.1: Laboratory reporting of selected gastrointestinal pathogens in England & Wales, 1997-2002. 3.4 Under-ascertainment of infectious intestinal disease (IID) is well-recognised, and the true population burden is greater than that given bynational surveillance. The ratio of infection in the community to reports tonational surveillance for Campylobacter spp. is approximately 8 to 1.77This means that, in 2000, there were approaching half a million Campylobacter cases in the community. 3.5 In 2000, it has been estimated that there were 1,388,772 cases of foodborne infection acquired in England and Wales (so called indigenousfoodborne disease (IFD)). Campylobacter accounted for 359,466 of these IFD cases.78It is estimated that there were 171,174 presentations to general practice due to Campylobacter infection, 16,946 hospital admissions (accounting for 62,701 hospital bed days) and 86 deaths.78 3.6 The economic burden due to Campylobacter infection is large. In the United States, the annual estimated cost is around US$4.3 billion.79The average cost of a case of acute Campylobacter infection (excluding long- term sequelae ) in England in 1995 was estimated to be \u00a3315.80 Conservatively, therefore, foodborne Campylobacter infection cost the nation over \u00a3113 million in 2000.77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 97 99 01 YearCryptosporidium Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 22Age-specific incidence estimates 3.7 Using population denominators, the highest age-specific incidence estimates are in children under the age of five years, with a secondary peakin young adults. 75,81-83Figure 3.2 shows the age and gender distribution of Campylobacter cases reported through the CSSS. This reveals a third peak in the 50-54 year old age group83and has been a consistent finding throughout the project. Figure 3.2: Age distribution of Campylobacter cases reported to the Campylobacter Sentinel Surveillance Scheme 3.8 Age-specific incidence estimates based on population denominators hide the fact that there is a much greater tendency to obtain samples fromyoung children. Thus, when faecal samples are used as the denominator, thehighest isolation rates are in young adults and the lowest in youngchildren. 84,85 Ethnicity 3.9 Analysis of the CSSS dataset has shown that people who described their ethnic origin as Pakistani were at a higher risk of infection, experiencedlonger periods of illness and higher rates of hospital admission. There was amarked skewing of the age distribution towards infants and a higherproportion of males was affected. The Pakistani community reported lowerlevels of chicken and red meat/meat product consumption, lower levels ofwater consumption and lower levels of contact with animals. These findingsare important because they suggest community-specific differences inroutes of transmission for Campylobacter infection. Thus failure to take ethnicity into consideration might mask important risk factors for infectionand limit understanding of disease transmission processes. 86020406080100120140160 < 1 25-29 41-44 Source: Health Protection Agency 23Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterSeasonality 3.10 A striking feature of the epidemiology of human Campylobacter infection is its remarkably pronounced and consistent seasonal pattern. Figure 3.3 shows weekly laboratory reports to the CDSC in England andWales. There is a sharp rise in cases in the late spring and early summer,which levels off in June and July. 87,88There is a suggestion that the precise timing of the seasonal peak varies with longitude. In a recent European study,weekly numbers peaked earliest in the western-most countries studied,peaking later further east. 88Although well characterised, the epidemiology of the seasonal peak in humans is not well understood. Various hypotheseshave been suggested, including buying puppies in the summer months, 89 consumption of bird-pecked milk,90-93or exposure to environmental risks.93 Figure 3.3: Weekly laboratory reports of Campylobacter spp. in England & Wales 1997-2001 3.11 In seeking to explain seasonality in human carriage rates, a variety of animal reservoirs have been examined. Campylobacter carriage rates in broiler chicken flocks94-96 and dairy cattle97peak in the spring and late summer, in contrast to lamb and beef cattle where such marked seasonalvariation in carriage rates have not been observed. 97,98 General outbreaks 3.12 A notable characteristic of Campylobacter epidemiology is that general outbreaks (ie. those affecting members of more than one household)are rarely recognised. 99,100Of the 2,374 general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease reported to CDSC between 1995 and 1999 where anaetiological agent was identified, Campylobacter accounted for only 50 (2%).100The proportion of Campylobacter cases recognised as being part of outbreaks during this period was only 0.4% compared with 8% for13 26 39 52 13 26 39 52 13 26 39 52 13 26 39 52 13 26 39 52 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Year and week number2000 18001600140012001000 800 600 400 200 0Number of reportsAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 24Salmonella and 15.5% for E. coli O157.100However, when general outbreaks of Campylobacter infection are recognised, they are more likely to be investigated using analytical epidemiology (as opposed to descriptivetechniques) than either Salmonella or E. coli O157 outbreaks, presumably because the rarity of the event stimulates such an investigation.100,101 3.13 Thirty-five of the 50 outbreaks reported to CDSC between 1995 and1999 were foodborne. Where a food vehicle was identified (24/35 outbreaks),the vehicle most frequently identified was poultry (13 chicken; one duck).Cross-contamination was the most commonly reported food-handling fault(18 outbreaks). 100 3.14 Analysis of the CCCS dataset suggests that point source generaloutbreaks might be more common than is currently recognised. Of the 3,489cases of Campylobacter jejuni infection reported in the first year of the study, 333 (10%) reported knowledge of an individual outside the household with asimilar illness. 102Cases who reported other illness in the community were more likely to have reported having eaten in restaurants or consumedunpasteurised milk. 102 There is a well known association between consumption of unpasteurised milk and outbreaks of Campylobacter infection in England and Wales,103so this finding, though unsurprising, adds weight to previous findings. Nevertheless raw milk for drinking remains onsale despite overwhelming scientific evidence 104-107 about the risks associated with its consumption, and despite the ACMSF 's recommendation that its sale in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should be banned (it isalready banned in Scotland). The impact of the restaurant setting in Campylobacter outbreaks is also well recognised99,100 and accords with the findings of epidemiological studies of sporadic disease linkingchicken prepared by, or eaten in, a commercial food establishmentwith infection. 108-110 Risk factors for sporadic disease Poultry 3.15 To explain the risk factors for sporadic disease (the majority of Campylobacter infection), case-control studies have been conducted in various settings. These have all demonstrated the complexity of theepidemiology of Campylobacter infection and, each time, a range of exposures has been identified. 3.16 Poultry consumption has been demonstrated to be a risk factor in several studies. Various types of poultry have been implicated assummarised below: any type of chicken;111-115 25Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterpoultry and poultry liver;116 raw or rare chicken;117-119 cooked chicken;118 processed chicken;120 chicken prepared by or eaten in a commercial food establishment.108-110,119,120 3.17 In a case-control study of primary, indigenous, sporadic campylobacteriosis in England and Wales, however, consumption orhandling of chicken cooked and eaten in the home was found to beprotective. 121Similarly, in a study in New Zealand, recent consumption of baked or roast chicken seemed to be protective, although consumption ofraw or undercooked chicken, or chicken from restaurants, was associatedwith illness. 108An earlier study in New Zealand also showed that eating at home was protective.122 3.18 The role of poultry consumption as a risk factor for Campylobacter infection in epidemiological studies can be confusing since, in certain case- control studies of sporadic disease, consumption of chicken is a risk factor,whilst in others it appears to protect against developing infection. In trying todisentangle these contradictions, there is a need to distinguish betweenchicken as a potential source of Campylobacter infection and chicken as a food vehicle. There is no doubt that poultry is a major source of Campylobacter spp.123and there is scope for cross-contamination of other foods if infected poultry is introduced into the kitchen. Yet if cooked properlythe contaminated chicken itself no longer poses a risk. Other foods 3.19 Other foods implicated as risk factors for sporadic Campylobacter infection include: barbecued meat;112,124 raw milk;108,115,116,125 Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 26Water 3.20 Consumption of untreated water,116,120or rainwater108have been implicated as risk factors for Campylobacter infection. In an ecological study in Sweden, positive associations were found between the incidence of Campylobacter and average water-pipe length per person. There were similar associations with ruminant density. These observations suggest thatdrinking water and contamination from livestock might also be importantfactors in explaining at least a proportion of human sporadicCampylobacteriosis. 127 Other risk factors 3.21 In addition to risks from food (especially poultry) and water consumption, contact with animals (either domestic pets or farmanimals), 115,116,120,124,125or reported problems with the home sewerage system, have also been implicated in infection.108 Underlying medical conditions such as diabetes114or reducing gastric acidity through the use of proton pump inhibitors128also increase the risk of acquiring Campylobacter infection. Epidemiological conundrums 3.22 Despite the multiplicity of risk factors identified for Campylobacter infection, in most case-control studies of Campylobacter infection the majority of cases remain unexplained.108-110,114,121,124That Campylobacter infection, like other foodborne zoonoses, is transmitted through more than one route is not in doubt. What is not known for certain is the relativeimportance of these transmission routes in the aetiology of infection. 3.23 It has been suggested that between 20% and 40% of sporadic disease might be due to the consumption of chicken. 130,131If this is so, controlling Campylobacter carriage in the poultry reservoir might have a measurably beneficial effect on human disease incidence. Nevertheless, thereasons behind the majority of human disease would still not have beentackled. 3.24 The paucity of recognised outbreaks has undoubtedly hampered scientific understanding of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection. By contrast, the epidemiology of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 is much better defined, and the diligent investigation of recognisedoutbreaks has made a major contribution to understanding the aetiology ofsporadic disease. 132 27Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter3.25 Many of the case-control studies have used a case definition incorporating Campylobacter spp., although recent evidence generated through the CSSS suggests that case-control studies should be conductedat least at the species level since inter-species differences in risk factorsmight occur. 74 3.26 The large proportion of unexplained cases might prove to be due to asyet unidentified risk factors or exposures that are very rare among unaffectedindividuals in the population. If this is the case, then very high poweredstudies will be needed to detect their effects. 129 Conclusions 3.27 Campylobacter infection is a major public health problem. The epidemiology is complex. There are extensive animal and environmentalreservoirs and multiple risk factors for infection. Although epidemiologicalpatterns, such as marked seasonality, are well described, their underlyingexplanations are still elusive despite much study. 3.28 Poultry appears to be an important source of infection. It is noteworthy that eating food, including poultry, on commercial catering premises hasbeen identified as a risk in several case-control studies. 3.29 In the case of poultry, some progress has been made in reducing the role of the food chain as a vehicle for Campylobacter infection. However, in addition to the contribution of poultry to human Campylobacter infection, many studies also point to numerous other sources and vehicles of Campylobacter infection. It is important that these are not overlooked. Recommendations 3.30 The contribution of foodborne transmission (as opposed to other transmission modes) to the human toll of Campylobacter needs to be better defined and we note that the Food Standards Agency has already funded aresearch project designed so to do. We support this course of action. (Priority A) 3.31 We r ecommend that population studies to investigate the seasonality of Campylobacter infection be undertaken. An approach combining epidemiological, microbiological, environmental andveterinary expertise is likely to be needed. (Priority A) 3.32 We r ecommend that population studies to investigate cultural/behavioural risk factors for Campylobacter be undertaken. (Priority B)Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 283.33 We recommend that more extensive data are gathered on the levels of Campylobacter spp. in specific foods (eg. water, dairy products, vegetables, poultry and red meat) as well as in food-producing animals and companion animals. These are all potentialsources of exposure for humans. We recommend that consideration begiven to on-going surveillance as well as to \"snap-shots\" which tend tobe the norm. It is very important that the microbiological methodsemployed allow meaningful comparisons to be made across the foodchain (see Chapter 9). (Priority A) 29Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 30Measures to prevent campylobacter contamination of chicken meat Introduction 4.1 Although various food vehicles are discussed in this Report as possible sources of human Campylobacter infection, we judge that particular attention needs to be given to chicken meat although the Working Grouprecognises the potential importance of other sources. Chicken meat as a source of human Campylobacter infection 4.2 As noted in Chapter 1, the Food Standards Agency carried out a survey in 2001 of the microbiological status of UK and non-UK chicken meaton retail sale in the UK. 7Fifty-six percent of fresh and 31% of frozen chicken sampled were contaminated with Campylobacter spp. A more detailed breakdown of these results is provided in Table 1.2. Control of Campylobacter in chickens 4.3 Campylobacter spp, principally Campylobacter jejuni and, to a lesser extent, Campylobacter coli, are common in commercial poultry flocks. Data from current FSA-, and past MAFF-funded, research and from the scientificliterature 133-138indicate that approximately 60% of housed (broiler) poultry flocks, both in the UK and elsewhere, are Campylobacter -positive at slaughter age. This will vary from company to company, from farmer tofarmer, and between flocks. Where numbers of colonised birds are lowerthan the average for housed poultry, it is likely that Campylobacter will only have become established towards the end of the commercial life of the flock.It is also possible that some strains of Campylobacter may spread more slowly in broiler flocks. There appears to be a general trend towards lowercolonisation rates in the UK, reflecting the fact that farmers are becomingmore successful in preventing the entry of this bacterium. 4.4 Campylobacter control is possible for housed birds, as interventions in Scandinavia, particularly Norway and Sweden, have illustrated (see Chapter5) and it is this type of production that we focus on in this Report. Theprevalence of Campylobacter -positive flocks in Denmark is currently similar to that in the UK,139,140although some Danish farmers routinely produce negative flocks. The interventions identified in this Chapter are primarilyapplicable to housed production. There seems likely to be a much moredifficult problem, however, with extensive production systems. The main 31Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter Chapter 4reason for this is that Campylobacter is ubiquitous in the natural environment and thus, if chickens are outdoors, they are more likely to be exposed tothese bacteria. Further research into the control of Campylobacter in extensively-reared (including free range and organic) chickens is necessary. Potential sources of Campylobacter spp. in chickens 4.5 Over the last 25 years, since the identification of poultry meat as an important source of human infection with Campylobacter spp., there have been many studies in many countries into the epidemiology of this zoonoticpathogen in poultry production. As with many areas of science, there is adegree of dispute over the importance of the various routes of infection,which are identified as: contaminated water; vertical transmission from parent flocks; contaminated feed; carry-over from a previous flock; domestic and/or wild animals and birds; contaminated transport crates, vehicles and personnel atflock thinning and when birds are weighed or maintenance iscarried out; equipment at times other than thinning; feed withdrawal; and the external environment around the broiler house; contaminated footwear and clothing of farm personnel andvisitors; transfer of contaminated equipment between houses. The potential sources shown above are not presented in rank order and it is recognised that contaminated feed, for example, is likely to be only a veryrare infection route (see below). 4.6 Although the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection in chickens has some similarities to that of Salmonella spp., there is one important difference. Salmonella primarily enters poultry flocks when the chicks are very young. Campylobacter is rarely found in broiler flocks until the birds are in the thirdAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 32week of life. There is currently no agreement on the reason(s) for this delay but the following have been suggested as having a role: maternal antibodies in young chicks, as most broiler-breederflocks are Campylobacter -positive and anti- Campylobacter antibodies may be present in egg yolks;141 the presence in birds of bacterial floras antagonistic to Campylobacter spp.142 It has not yet been possible to determine why birds apparently become susceptible to Campylobacter at 3-4 weeks of age. It could clearly be due to one or both of the above factors. It is also important to recognise that thebirds ' metabolism and gut flora will change with age, diet and environment, which may also affect susceptibility. Similarly, vaccines given in the thirdweek of life may also play a role. 4.7 The control of Campylobacter spp. in broiler production is principally one of identifying ways by which the three-week Campylobacter -free period can be extended until slaughter age. Essentially, this means either preventingthe entry of the bacteria into the flock and/or improving the resistance of thebirds to colonisation. For exclusion to be achieved, the most importantsources of flock infection need to be identified. A number have beenimplicated and are discussed below. Contaminated water 4.8 One study, on a farm in the UK,143,144and a number of investigations in Scandinavia,94,135have demonstrated that contaminated water, particularly when untreated ground water is used, can be responsible for theintroduction of Campylobacter spp. into poultry flocks. This was also identified as an important source in Norway when Campylobacter Working Group members visited that country in November 2002. Studies byPearson 143,144raised the intriguing prospect that viable non-culturable (VNC) Campylobacter was responsible for the initial colonisation event. There is much dispute about the importance of this physiological state (see Chapter2) but improved isolation methods are now able to recover cells of Campylobacter thought to be VNC. Of all the potential routes, waterborne infection should be the easiest for farmers to control. It is very important thatall poultry flocks receive only water of potable quality. Additional treatment,in the form of chlorine or ozone, is also likely to prove beneficial. Caution mayneed to be exercised with regard to the use of ozone as this compound canbe toxic. The use of chlorine was part of a package of measures shown tomarkedly reduce flock colonisation in an on-farm trial in the East ofEngland. 145,146 Organic acids such as peracetic acid, sometimes used in combination with hydrogen peroxide or stabilised with silver to enhancestability and antibacterial activity and reduce corrosion, may also be useful. 33Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterWork is needed to determine whether the use of such treatments prior to slaughter can help to reduce Campylobacter levels in the chicken gut. 4.9 Drinking water provided by bell and cup drinkers may also act as a vehicle for horizontal transmission within the broiler house once Campylobacter has become established, as these can allow young chickens in particular to contaminate the water. It is noted that drinkers may act as avehicle for transmission within the broiler house once Campylobacter has become established and that Campylobacter can become part of biofilms established in broiler house water systems, a phenomenon that we believerequires further investigation 147,148. Vertical transmission from parent flocks 4.10 There is continuing debate about the relative contribution of vertical transmission of Campylobacter spp. from breeding flocks. Kazwala et al149 and van de Giessen et al150suggest that, because it is possible in a minority of flocks to isolate Campylobacter from broilers within 1-2 days after hatching, the bacteria could be acquired vertically. Recent work 151,152 showed that C. jejuni could colonise the oviduct, probably as a result of an ascending infection from the cloaca. Investigations in the USA also providesome evidence to support the view that certain strains of C. jejuni may be transmitted vertically from colonised breeder flocks.151However, this is a highly contentious area, and it has yet to be demonstrated beyondreasonable doubt that Campylobacte r spp. can be isolated from newly hatched chicks. It may be that the bacteria track up from the cloaca andbecome transient colonisers of reproductive tissues. 151Published studies have largely used as the basis for their conclusion that vertical transmissionhas occurred, that the same Campylobacter strain has been isolated from parent flocks and their progeny.153In work of this kind, it is important to rule out infection from common sources, particularly with more common strains. Campylobacter has, however, been recovered from semen samples from breeder cockerels.154This does provide some support for vertical transmission, at least in a US setting, and more work may be needed in thisarea in Europe. The fact that it is very difficult to isolate Campylobacter from birds less than 2-4 weeks of age is an argument against verticaltransmission, although it cannot yet be ruled out as an occasional route. Inaddition, the fact that some farms frequently produce Campylobacter -free flocks, often one after another, also makes vertical transmission lessprobable. 4.11 A body of work has also been undertaken on the survival of Campylobacter spp. in the contents of artificially-contaminated eggs, and on the ability of these bacteria to penetrate egg shells. Data on this areequivocal. Shanker et al155examined 187 eggs from Campylobacter -positive breeder flocks. Two showed evidence of penetration of the egg shell. Theprogeny of positive breeder flocks were also examined and it was found thatAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 34all 14 flocks examined remained Campylobacter -negative until slaughter. Egg contamination studies were also performed. 257 eggs werecontaminated with C. jejuni on the surface. 162 hatched; all were Campylobacter -negative. Campylobacter was injected into the contents of 167 eggs. 12 hatched and 2 of the chicks were infected. The authorsconclude that their data do not support vertical transmission of Campylobacter spp. When fertile eggs were infected with Campylobacter and incubated immediately, up to 100% of the chicks had the bacterium in their intestines. When eggs were stored for 5 days before incubation, theincidence of Campylobacter -positive eggs fell to 20% or less, and no chicks contained Campylobacter on hatching.156These data indicate that Campylobacter may not survive well in egg contents, and this has been re- examined in a recent study.157A temperature differential method, where cooling eggs are immersed in a culture broth, was used to contaminate eggs.It was found that C. jejuni had only limited ability to penetrate the egg shell. In other components of this work, C. jejuni was found to survive well in egg yolk, but poorly in either albumen or air sacs. Campylobacter jejuni was detected in 3 of 65 egg pools (5-10 eggs per pool, laid by infected breeders)when the eggs were tested soon after lay. When eggs were stored for 7 daysat 18 \u00b0C before testing, all 500 examined were Campylobacter -negative. This study also examined 500 fresh eggs from breeders shown to be Campylobacter -positive, and 1,000 eggs from a commercial hatchery. All were Campylobacter -negative. The authors conclude that this suggests that vertical transmission is a rare event. There is clearly some need to examinethis aspect in European production systems. There is also a possibility thata small number of chicks are Campylobacter -positive at hatching, and that the bacteria take time to spread through the flock to a sufficient level toallow detection. Contaminated feed 4.12 It is well established that contaminated feed is a potentially important route of flock infection with Salmonella spp.158This does not seem to be the case with Campylobacter . The ubiquity of Campylobacter in food animals and the environment means that raw feed ingredients will often becontaminated with these bacteria by wild bird droppings, for example.However, Campylobacter spp. are very sensitive to dry conditions and have been shown to die quickly when present in poultry feed.159We judge that the Salmonella control measures in place in the UK to improve feed hygiene will be adequate to control Campylobacter spp. However, it is important to remember that, as with water, feed can act as a vehicle for horizontaltransmission in a broiler house once Campylobacter has become established. It is also possible that feed may be saved at de-population andused with subsequent flocks. This feed may represent a higher infection risk.Many of the studies undertaken on the survival of Campylobacter in feed used techniques subsequently shown to lack sensitivity. It would be useful torepeat such work using appropriate, sensitive methodologies. 35Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterCarry-over from a previous flock 4.13 Some studies have demonstrated that the same type of Campylobacter can be isolated from successive flocks.160,161One possible explanation is therefore that the bacteria were carried over from one flock tothe next. It is also possible that both flocks were colonised from the samesource. However, laboratory-derived data indicate that Campylobacter spp. are significantly more sensitive to damaging conditions than Salmonella .162,163Buildings should be of sound construction and well- maintained to prevent access by wild birds and to deter rodents. If housecleaning and disinfection are undertaken properly, then Campylobacter will be absent from cleaned houses, and any regime which removes Salmonella spp. will eliminate Campylobacter. It is thus unlikely that this potential source is important, although one study in Denmark found that the majority of broilerflocks (11/12) carried identical Campylobacter isolates in two or more flocks.160As discussed above, it was not possible in this study to differentiate between carry-over and a common source. Whatever theimportance of carry-over, given the ability of Campylobacter spp. to colonise, it is essential that house cleaning and disinfection are rigorously carried out. Domestic and/or wild animals and birds 4.14 Most warm-blooded animals carry Campylobacter spp. Wild animals and birds act largely as an indirect source of flock infection, as aconsequence of environmental contamination. Similarly, farms with mixedanimal species also run the risk of increased flock infection because farmstaff may transmit the bacteria from cattle, sheep or pigs to chickens. Theincreased risk that this poses may seriously undermine biosecurity, and apotentially important control measure is to rear chickens on species mono-specific farms. Given that cats and dogs are also frequently Campylobacter - positive, it is also important that these animals are not allowed access topoultry flocks. Anti- Salmonella control measures which prevent the access of wild birds and rodents will contribute to protecting flocks from Campylobacter colonisation too. 4.15 Houseflies have also been shown to act as a source of C. jejuni for specific pathogen-free chicks.164This is likely to be the result of surface contamination, rather than faecal excretion, as Jones et al165could not isolate Campylobacter from flies after surface disinfection. Rosef and Kapperud166isolated Campylobacter from 43-50% of flies sampled around poultry houses. Our Campylobacter Working Group was able to find no published information on possible roles for flies and other insects astransmission vehicles in commercial settings. Flies and other arthropods arelikely to enter the broiler house in larger numbers in the summer and maythus be involved in the 'summerpeak ' of infection. This might be particularly relevant if sources of Campylobacter are close to broiler houses.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 36Contaminated transport crates, vehicles and personnel at flock thinning 4.16 Many poultry companies in the UK carry out the practice of \"thinning \", for welfare reasons. Broiler houses are stocked with numbers of birds whichwould be above the recommendation for stocking density if all the birdsremained until slaughter weight. To overcome this, at approximately 5 weeksof age a cohort of birds is removed for slaughter, with the remainder beingkept for 1-2 weeks further. Thinning also provides producers with thenecessary flexibility to react quickly to the demands of the fresh retail market.It is not unusual for ordering by customers to exceed projected demand ten-fold from day to day. These fluctuations in demand could not beaccommodated in the absence of the flexibility which thinning provides.However, thinning has a number of important public health implications, inrelation to contamination introduced on-farm by staff and visitors and oncrates, as well as the deleterious effects of stress. Studies in Denmark havefound that this process is a significant risk factor for flock colonisation with Campylobacter spp.167 4.17 During the thinning process, crates and modules that may be contaminated can introduce Campylobacter into a previously negative flock.168,169The gloves and clothing of the catchers have also been shown to be Campylobacter -positive.169The potential ingress of Campylobacter is compounded by the fact that the birds often become stressed as a result ofthe catching process. This may render those remaining in the house moresusceptible to colonisation with Campylobacter spp. 4.18 Birds are transported to slaughter in crates by lorry. During catching, loading and transportation to the processing plant, the crate surfaces andthe lorry decks become contaminated with faeces from the birds in thecrates. The cost of poultry transport crates means that they are usedrepeatedly. Given the high incidence of Campylobacter in broiler chickens, crates are frequently contaminated with these bacteria. Crates must becleaned and disinfected after use. They are washed at the processing plant,but this process has been shown to be far from ideal. 167,169The water is often re-cycled from the processing plant, is often used at ambient temperature,and the levels of detergents and/or disinfectants are often sub-optimal andmay also be quickly neutralised by the high levels of organic matter presentin the crate wash water, which will be re-cycled within the crate washer.Crates therefore often leave the washer contaminated with Campylobacter spp. 4.19 Schedule 1 of The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, provides that means of transport and receptacles shall be constructed, maintainedand operated so as to allow appropriate cleaning and disinfection. TheTransport of Animals (Cleansing and Disinfection) (England) (No. 2) Order2000 requires all animal transport vehicles and containers to be cleansed 37Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterand disinfected after each use and within 24 hours of the journey being completed. Assured Chicken Production (ACP)ahas produced a leaflet entitled \"Poultry standards: catching, transport and slaughter \". Rule 3.7 states that \"Processing plants must provide cleaning and sanitation provisions for crates and transporters. All transporters and crates must bewashed after unloading \". No information is given about perceived best practice. 4.20 The decks of vehicles used to carry the crates also become contaminated and will spread contamination if they are not adequatelycleansed and disinfected between journeys. In addition, as lorry tyres arepotential vectors of Campylobacter , there should be a disinfectant wheel bath, or each wheel should be sprayed before entry to, and exit from, apoultry unit. 4.21 Thinning has a number of important public health implications. It is therefore essential in terms of microbiological safety that, where it ispractised, crate, module and lorry washing are properly carried out and thatcrates are not contaminated with Campylobacter (or, indeed, with other pathogenic microorganisms). Other biosecurity measures, in relation toclothing, footwear, etc are also essential. We believe that improved hygienestandards will yield improved benefits in flock health and may help offset theincreased costs involved. Unless the poultry industry is prepared to takethese necessary steps to improve the microbiological acceptability ofthinning, then we strongly believe that the practice should be discontinued(the industry adjusting stocking densities as necessary to achieve requiredstandards of welfare), thus reducing the risks of transmitting Campylobacter infection. In adopting this stance, we do not overlook the very strong submissions we have received from informed industry sources underliningthe difficulties the industry is facing in what is a highly competitive and pricesensitive sector where import penetration is a continuing threat. Wenevertheless believe that the public health implications of thinning, as well asthe deleterious effects of stress on stock, are too important to be ignored. The effects of feed withdrawal 4.22 An important hygiene problem in broiler processing is the accidental contamination of the carcass at slaughter by gut contents, particularly faecalmaterial, and, as a consequence, the spread of pathogens such as Campylobacter . To reduce the danger, feed is withdrawn some time before birds are loaded into their transport crates, whether at thinning or at finaldepopulation. Fasting periods of 4-10 hours have been recommended 170 (indeed, in our Report on Poultry Meat,171we concluded that, on balance, a period of between 6 and 10 hours should be allowed between feeding andkill). However, the overall period without feed will be longer than this becauseAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 38aAssured Chicken Production (ACP), which presented evidence to the ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group, operates detailed poultry standards. There is more information about these in Annex D.of the time taken to load and transport the birds to the processing plant, and any time spent waiting in lairage before slaughter. These factors must betaken into account by the farmer when deciding when to withdraw feed. Theaverage transport time for broilers in the UK is 3.6 hours, although somebirds can spend over 12 hours in crates before slaughter. 172It is possible that broilers could spend between 7-20 hours without feed before slaughter. 4.23 There is continuing debate about whether these fasting times are, in fact, beneficial. Reducing the gut contents will reduce the pressure on theintestines and any leakage of contents on to the carcass if the gut isaccidentally broken during evisceration. However, even prolonged feedwithdrawal will not completely prevent defaecation occurring during ante mortem handling. Removing feed, or both feed and water, have similar effects on gut contents. Most reduction in weight occurs in the crop, andleast in the caeca and cloaca. An important finding is that the contents ofmost parts of the gut, but particularly those of the crop and cloaca, getwetter with longer deprivation. In contrast, caecal contents become slightlydrier. Fasting tends to progressively increase the number ofEnterobacteriaceae and Campylobacter in all parts of the gut but especially in the caeca and cloaca. 4.24 Feed withdrawal will not eliminate cross-contamination of the plumage of live birds with faecal matter during transport. Moreover, it may also haveunforeseen adverse effects by inducing stress, which may pre-dispose birdsto Campylobacter infection. Work with Salmonella spp. has shown that birds may become systemically infected very rapidly (within 2 hours) afterexposure to sources of infection. 173It is likely, given the commonness of Campylobacter in poultry, that infection with this bacterium will be equally rapid. Feed withdrawal may also affect the microbiological flora of the gut bymodifying the growth of bacteria normally present, such as lactobacilli, withsubsequent changes in the pH of the gut contents. Lactobacilli are alsoknown to have the ability to prevent/reduce intestinal colonisation withzoonotic pathogens. For example, a study, which examined the effects ofstress in young monkeys 174found that this was associated with a reduction in levels of lactic acid bacteria in the gut. Many of the stressed animalsbecame infected with C. jejuni , which was endemic in the colony. It is also of interest that longer feed withdrawal times (up to 24 hours) are associatedwith a higher prevalence of chickens testing positive for C. jejuni in crop samples before slaughter.175Thus, do the possible increased risks of gut breakage, and greater susceptibility to infection, outweigh perceived benefitson lower carcass contamination levels with zoonotic pathogens like Campylobacter spp? 4.25 Whatever the pros and cons of the above, it would not be unreasonable to postulate that birds remaining after thinning might be moresusceptible to infection as a result of a combination of disturbance and feed 39Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterwithdrawal. This practice is only likely to have a marginal effect on the Campylobacter status of birds removed for slaughter. The environment as a source of flock colonisation 4.26 Although flock colonisation is possible by any of the routes identified above, there is a general agreement in the international scientific communitythat the environment around the broiler house is the most important sourceof flock colonisation. 94,133,135,176-178Campylobacter spp. can be isolated with regularity from the farm and the natural environment. It has been shown that Campylobacter spp. from the external environment can match those in broiler chickens.176The bacteria are present in the environment as a consequence of faecal contamination from wild and domestic animals andbirds. A recent study in Denmark has cast some doubt, however, on the roleof wild animals and birds as sources of Campylobacter spp. for broiler chickens, but did confirm the importance of the contaminatedenvironment. 179The use of manures as fertilisers also constitutes an infection risk. Investigations with one UK poultry producer, whose system istypical of UK production, demonstrated that farmers with poor farm hygienepractices were more likely to produce Campylobacter -positive flocks than those whose hygiene was good.180The inference to be drawn from this work is that \"dirty\" farms are likely to have a higher loading of Campylobacter in the environment, and that \"dirty\" farmers may be more likely to carry the bacteria into the broiler house. Although Campylobacter are generally regarded as being sensitive to the extra-intestinal environment they may beable to survive for extended periods in areas with high water levels such aspuddles, drainage channels etc. 4.27 A number of different Campylobacter sub-types can be isolated from a broiler flock, and even from the same bird. In general, however, one or twosubtypes will dominate the bacterial population. There is some dispute overwhether the different subtypes indicate the entry of two different bacteria, orwhether the genomic instability of Campylobacter leads to changes in the original strain, which produce an identifiably different bacterium.181The principal event in the colonisation of a broiler flock is the establishment of thebacterium in the first bird(s). Passage through a chicken has been shown togreatly increase the ability of Campylobacter to colonise subsequent birds.182,183Spread can be very rapid in a newly colonised flock, and almost all birds will be Campylobacter -positive within a few days of the initial colonisation event.142A major component of any control strategy must therefore be to prevent Campylobacter from the environment entering the broiler house. It would also be valuable to determine why, in some flocks, notall birds are infected and whether this represents differences in hostsusceptibility or bacterial pathogenicity. 4.28 The most important anti- Campylobacter control measures, falling within the term \"biosecurity \", help ensure that the bacterium is kept out ofAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 40the broiler house. It is important to note that Campylobacter is more difficult to exclude from chickens than Salmonella spp. Thus, measures which exclude Salmonella may not be successful with Campylobacter . With this bacterium, the margins for error are much smaller, and much more attentionto detail may be required in order to achieve robust security. Good farmingpractice and high levels of stockmanship are seen as an essential basis forthe successful and continuing avoidance of Campylobacter entry and spread. 4.29 The average broiler flock experiences many visits by different people during the growing cycle. Each one carries with it the risk of allowing Campylobacter into the flock. Visits should be limited to essential personnel, with each visit fully justified and recorded. There will still be at least dailyvisits to the flock by farm staff, and it is vital that these are undertaken ashygienically as possible. One study in SW England found that, when farmstaff dipped their footwear in strong phenolic disinfectant, it was possible toeither prevent or delay flock colonisation in three flocks. 180This method may be difficult to sustain for long periods, as the disinfectant baths may not bechanged with sufficient regularity and can become contaminated with soiland other organic matter. A much better approach is to supplement the footdips by constructing a hygiene barrier at the entrance to the anteroom whichadjoins the area housing the birds. Sets of dedicated outer clothing andfootwear should be held on the inside of the hygiene barrier. All people whoenter the broiler house should remove their own footwear and put on theprotective clothing and shoes/boots. Where dedicated footwear is not in use,shoes/boots must be dipped in disinfectant baths before entry into the flock.The disinfectant should be changed frequently to ensure continued efficacy.Wider, more easily cleaned, concreted areas separating the entrance to thehouses from the farm environment (as seen in Denmark during the WorkingGroup 's visit - see Chapter 5) would also increase the buffer zone, and there would also be benefit in coating the sites in coarse gravel to enhance theeffectiveness of routine spraying for weeds. 4.30 The above approach has been shown to be effective in trials in the UK 145,146and over a sustained period in the Netherlands and Scandinavia,94,138,177,178,184and we see no reason why this type of Campylobacter control requirement cannot be incorporated into farm assurance schemes in the UK. A study undertaken by the VeterinaryLaboratories Agency 185investigated Scandinavian-type intervention in the UK. Measures tested included boot dipping, changing boots and outerclothing, and hand washing. Data from this study show that, wherepersonnel strictly followed the biosecurity programme, flocks were 3-timesless likely to be Campylobacter -positive. Flock colonisation rates were also halved if boot dips were changed more than once per week. Such measureshave the advantage of being relatively inexpensive, although we dorecognise that such systems can be difficult to sustain in the long-term. 186,187 41Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAll companies should have standard operating procedures for biosecurity and related matters. There should be a forward looking veterinary health planwhich includes appropriate training of all farm staff on how to prevent theintroduction of infection into flocks. Farmers also need to be convinced thatno emergency, flood and fire apart, is so urgent that the broiler flocks can beentered without outer clothing but, particularly, footwear being changed.Precautions must encompass all visits to the site, both human and vehicular.A single visit can result in flock colonisation by Campylobacter spp. 4.31 We are confident that properly applied biosecurity will significantly reduce the incidence of Campylobacter colonisation in housed chickens. We recognise that this may be more difficult to apply in the UK than inScandinavia where the winters are much harsher and the number of housesper farm may be lower. No information is currently available on the loading of Campylobacter in the farm environment but it is possible that the harsh winters in Scandinavia markedly reduce pathogen numbers. Work is neededto examine this. Indeed, an examination of data from Scandinavian countriesillustrates that flock infection rates in summer can approach those of the UK.The ACMSF was presented with evidence which convinced us that, on manyfarms, effective biosecurity is an achievable objective which should beexplored with some urgency by the UK industry. Some farmers are alreadyquite successful in excluding Campylobacter . There are no viable alternatives at present to proper and sustained biosecurity. It may be,however, that this approach could be supported in the future by othermeasures such as phage treatment, pre- or probiotics. 4.32 The Working Group was presented with a wide range of opinion on the major factors for broiler flock colonisation with Campylobacter spp. The following summarises the key risks and potential control measures: Re-stocking. Measures applied between one flock and thenext could be important in control and proper cleaning anddisinfecting is vital. People entering the flock pose the greatest risk and theirnumbers and activities, particularly with regard to maintenanceof biosecurity, should be strictly controlled. Water can act as a primary and secondary source and watersupply hygiene is important. Thinning also represents a substantial risk and hygieneimprovements are urgently required. Broiler flock management and Campylobacter colonisation 4.33 It is perhaps natural, given its commonality in poultry, to regardAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 42Campylobacter as normal gut flora in chickens, although infection has been shown to be transient in wild birds. In poultry flocks, the high stockingdensities may allow a maintenance of infection by re-cycling between birds.Given that it is now possible for many producers in the UK and elsewhere inEurope to regularly produce Campylobacter -negative chickens, this definition may need to be reviewed. Campylobacter in housed chickens does not seem to behave like either, eg., Escherichia coli or faecal streptococci which will be found in all chickens, irrespective of their Campylobacter status. A more accurate description for Campylobacter in housed flocks would perhaps be \"frequent coloniser \". There have been many studies on risk factors for broiler flock colonisation with Campylobacter.94,135- 138,178,179,188-192One currently in progress in the UK includes an examination of the differences between farmers who produce broiler flocks with different Campylobacter infection rates. This arose from an examination of data from poultry companies which showed that farmers differ markedly in their abilityto produce chickens which at slaughter age are Campylobacter -free. Some farmers can rear negative flocks with high frequency, whilst with others,almost all birds will be Campylobacter -positive. These observations give reasons for confidence that practical measures are available for reducing Campylobacter on a commercial basis. Work is needed to examine the behaviour of Campylobacter in individual birds in flocks to inform this debate. 4.34 Our Campylobacter Working Group was presented with preliminary data from research carried out in cooperation with one company in the SouthWest of England. Some of the data from this work are presented in Figure 4.1and compare two farms in the company which represent the ends of theindustry spectrum of broiler flock positivity. One farm (A) had only 1.4% Campylobacter- positive chickens over six flock cycles. In contrast, 97% of birds from the other farm (B) were colonised over the same period. The feedwas identical and both farms received the same type of birds, albeit possiblyfrom different broiler-breeder flocks and from breeders of different ages. Thislatter point may be of importance, as industry data suggest that chicks frombreeder flocks that are either entering or leaving the period of lay will be ofpotentially poorer quality than when breeders are in the peak period ofproductivity. There are a multitude of reasons why the two farms differ inperformance with regard to the exclusion of Campylobacter spp. It is likely that, in general terms, the infection of broiler chickens with Campylobacter relies on chance and requires that a chicken in the flock is presented with sufficient cells to constitute an infective dose. In this respect, hostsusceptibility will be important. It would not be unreasonable to assume thatchickens in poor health or kept in poor conditions may be more susceptible.With this in mind, the comparison in Figure 4.1 shows that there are markeddifferences between the two flocks in terms of flock mortality, the level ofrejects at slaughter, and in two measures of the nature of the material uponwhich the birds sit, namely hock and pad burn. In each case, the birds fromthe farm which almost always produces Campylobacter -negative birds had 43Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterbetter production scores. One interpretation of these data is that birds in which health, performance or welfare are poor are compromised in theirability to withstand challenge from Campylobacter. Figure 4.1: A comparison of low and high Campylobacter farms in relation to certain health/quality indicators 4.35 One factor that might differ between the two farms is dryness of the litter, and this is known to be an important factor in the epidemiology of Salmonella infection. Data suggest that Campylobacter spp. in dry litter may be less infectious than bacteria in wet litter,190,193probably because the bacteria survive less well in dry litter.194Treatment of litter with either aluminium sulphate or sodium bisulphate also significantly reduced theincidence of Campylobacter colonisation.195 4.36 The aetiology of hock and pad burn is not yet fully understood but, essentially, they are manifestations of physical damage to the birds ' feet and legs as a consequence of contact with litter of poor quality. The cause ofthese lesions is multi-factorial. Evidence currently available indicates thatthere is little relationship between the incidence of the two lesions. 196 Moreover, these problems are not confined to housed birds, and are seenwith free-range birds too. Industry 's view is that hock and pad burn come about from a combination of poor diet, poor ventilation, and over-supply ofdrinking water, leading to wet litter, but that there is no direct relationshipbetween these conditions and the Campylobacter status of the birds.01234567 Mortality Rejects Hock Burn Pad burnA B 1.8 6.4% of birds Farm A has consistently fewer Campylobacter -positive chickens. Farm B has consistently greater numbers of Campylobacter -positive chickens. NB: The vertical axis uses an arbitrary scale to compare birds from the two farms. In essence, the data on mortality and rejects at the processing plant are recorded figures whereas those for hock and pad burn are the recorded figures divided by 10. This was done to allow an easier comparison between farms. Source: Unpublished data from the University of BristolAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 444.37 There are welfare and public health needs to identify the key differences between farms which differ with respect to Campylobacter status. If it is true that healthier chickens are able to resist Campylobacter , then there are two potential benefits for the poultry industry. Productivity andprofitability will be improved, and contamination levels with Campylobacter will be reduced. The ACMSF recognises the potential dangers of trying to over-simplify the control of Campylobacter in chickens, but the evidence we have seen clearly shows that some farmers are more successful than othersin controlling this important zoonotic pathogen. It is vital that, if there arelessons to be learned from the more successful farmers, they are used toinform others in the industry. Vaccination and other treatments as anti- Campylobacter measures 4.38 Surveillance of Campylobacter isolates from human cases and chickens has shown that strains present in the latter are not always found inthe former. This raises the intriguing prospect that some chicken-associated Campylobacter strains are non-pathogenic for humans. Given that the poultry gut flora usually contain a dominant Campylobacter type, the non- pathogenic strains may have a role as agents to exclude potential humanpathogens. Recently published work has shown that, under laboratoryconditions, birds colonised with one Campylobacter isolate were able to resist challenge with another.197,198Caution may be needed with this approach. The genome of C. jejuni contains many hypervariable sequences10 and these allow a high degree of genetic adaptability. Given that passage through the chicken gut increases the ability of C. jejuni to colonise other chickens,182,183it must be established beyond all reasonable doubt that the strains used as exclusion agents do not change to become humanpathogens. It should also be borne in mind that human and poultrypopulations are surveyed in very different ways, often using differenttechniques. Thus, the absence of a strain in one population at a particulartime cannot necessarily be taken to mean that it is always absent. Similarly,a strain may not be detected in chickens or on carcasses because it is onlypresent in low numbers. This strain may, however, be able to infect humans,even when present at low levels. 4.39 The use of mixed bacterial cultures as an anti- Salmonella measure in broiler production is well established in the international poultry industry, andthis approach is usually referred to as 'competitive exclusion '. 199Some work has been undertaken to try to develop preparations with efficacy against Campylobacter spp. Results have been mixed so far.200-205Another approach may be possible. Young, Campylobacter -negative, broiler chickens have been shown to have a gut flora which is naturally antagonistic to C. jejuni .142,202,204Experimental data indicate that these gut bacteria, under 45Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterlaboratory conditions, are able to protect against challenge with broth cultures of C. jejuni .202,204This may provide an explanation for why chickens do not usually become Campylobacter- positive until the third week of life. More work is needed on this approach, but it has the advantage of being a'natural ' phenomenon. 4.40 In common with all other bacteria, Campylobacter spp. can be attacked by viruses known as bacteriophages (or phages). These virusesgenerally have a limited host range, a fact which allows them to be used astyping agents for both Campylobacter and Salmonella spp. Phages are found naturally in the chicken gut and offer another potential control measure.Research on this approach continues, but it may one day be possible to treata Campylobacter -positive flock a few days before slaughter to either reduce or eliminate carriage of the bacteria. A possible limitation with this approachis that it might lead to an increase in the prevalence of phage-resistant Campylobacter strains. 4.41 The genome of a strain of C. jejuni has been sequenced, which has made it possible to better understand the behaviour of this bacterium. Workis in progress to establish a library of Campylobacter strains with mutations in different single genes. By using these bacteria in chicken colonisationstudies, it should be possible to identify the genes which enable Campylobacter to establish in the chicken intestine. A medium to long term aim of this work is that, by better understanding the genetics of gutcolonisation, it may be possible to produce component vaccines againstparticular cell targets. 4.42 One reason suggested for the delay in the colonisation of broiler chickens with Campylobacter is the presence of maternal antibodies which protect the chicks during the first few weeks of life. There is an increasingbody of evidence which suggests that chickens can mount an antibodyresponse to Campylobacter spp. One study141determined the prevalence of anti-C. jejuni antibodies in breeders, the yolks of their eggs, and in broilers. High antibody levels were found in breeders and egg yolks. When broilerswere examined, sera from 1 and 7 day old chicks also contained highantibody levels which then declined and became undetectable by 3-4 weeks.A recent study 206has also provided valuable information about possible roles of maternal antibodies. Laboratory challenges were used to determinewhether Campylobacter -specific maternal antibody (MAB) plays a protective role in young chickens. Colonisation with C. jejuni was compared in 3 day old broiler chicks which were MAB-positive, and 21 day old birds which wereMAB-negative. Colonisation occurred much sooner in the older birds than itdid in the younger ones, indicating a possible involvement of specific MABin the delay of colonisation seen naturally. To examine this further,Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 46Campylobacter -positive and negative specific pathogen-free chickens were raised under laboratory conditions, and their progenies with or without Campylobacter -specific MAB were challenged orally with C. jejuni . Significantly fewer colonised chickens were observed in the MAB + groupduring the first week post-infection. The authors state that MAB did not seemto affect the development of systemic immune response following infectionwith C. jejuni , although such responses occurred earlier and more strongly in birds infected at 21 days of age than in those infected at 3 days. Clearanceof Campylobacter infection was also observed in chickens infected at 21 days of age. 4.43 There have been a number of other studies which have examined antibody production in response to artificial infection. 1 day old chickschallenged with a strain of C. jejuni showed significant increases in IgG, IgA and IgM circulating antibodies following oral challenge, with levels peaking9, 5 and 7 weeks post-infection respectively. Specific mucosal IgG and IgAantibodies were also seen, and maternal IgG antibodies were also detectedover the first 2 weeks. The major antibody response was to flagellinproteins. 207Two other studies using artificially-infected chicks208,209found similar results. One209also demonstrated the presence of antibody in the sera of 11 of 12 naturally-colonised broiler flocks. In contrast, one study,210 which used 11 C. jejuni strains, found that there was a poor antibody response to oral challenge with the bacterium. The authors found high levelsof maternal antibodies and concluded that these could be responsible fordelays in colonisation seen in broiler flocks. In a novel study, Noor et al211 found that the vaccination of the forming embryo in ovo also stimulated the precocious development of immunity in chicks. 4.44 The above indicate that current data on immune responses by chickens to Campylobacter remain equivocal and may require further investigation. In addition to the studies mentioned earlier,141,206other work has been done to examine whether the administration of antibodies canprotect chickens against challenge with Campylobacter . In one investigation,212cells of a C. jejuni strain, treated with various chicken anti- Campylobacter antibody preparations, were used to infect chickens. The authors concluded that pre-exposure to antibodies inhibited subsequentcolonisation of chicken caeca. Other work 213found that chickens immunised intraperitoneally with killed whole cells of C. jejuni , and subsequently challenged with live cells, had only 2% of the levels in caeca found in non-immunised control birds. Later work by this group 214found that intraperitoneal vaccination with heat-killed cells reduced numbers of C. jejuni in the caeca of artificially-infected birds by 2-logs. The major antigen against which antibody activity was directed was flagellin protein. Another study,215 which used oral vaccination with formalin-killed cells of C. jejuni , found that 47Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterreductions in colonisation in vaccinated birds ranged from 16-93% of caecal levels compared to controls. The administration of anti- Campylobacter antibodies prior to infection resulted in a marked reduction (>99%) in caecal Campylobacter levels in artificially-infected broilers. Administration of antibodies after infection had been established also reduced levels in thecaecum, although effects were smaller (80-95% reduction). 216 4.45 Evidence to date suggests that chickens can mount an antibodyresponse to both natural and artificial challenge with C. jejuni . Vaccination with killed cells of Campylobacter , or treatment with antibodies, provide some protection. There is thus a possibility that such treatments could havecommercial application. Given the economic constraints under which thepoultry industry operates, the protective preparations must be able to bedelivered on a mass scale and in a cost-effective manner. They should alsoafford protection against a broad range of Campylobacter strains. 4.46 Another long-term anti- Campylobacter measure is to develop breeds of chickens which cannot be colonised with these bacteria. It has alreadybeen established that genetic lines of chickens differ in susceptibility to Salmonella spp., and work is in progress to examine whether similar differences will be seen with Campylobacter spp. Carcass treatments 4.47 It is our strongly held view that the main focus for the control of Campylobacter in chickens should be the farm and that particular attention should be given to improving biosecurity. We do not rule out the possibilitythat processing aids will be developed, the use of which may supplement on-farm biosecurity measures. We discuss some options below. However, wewish to stress that none of the treatments discussed below should beregarded as a substitute for good hygiene practice. 4.48 In Denmark, risk modelling has suggested that a 2-log 10 reduction in carcass contamination levels could lead to substantial reductions in humaninfection rates. Research in many countries has shown that a number ofapproaches are possible to reduce Campylobacter contamination levels on chicken carcasses and most can achieve the 2-log10 reduction, believed to be significant in Danish calculations. It should be borne in mind that therecan be marked variations in the levels of contamination from <10 3to > 109 per carcass, as assessed by the enumeration of cells in a single carcassrinse. 123 4.49 Gamma irradiation has been shown to be effective against Campylobacter spp. in raw ground beef.217Given the success of this approach with Salmonella spp. on chicken carcasses,218it is likely that it would be effective with Campylobacter also. Studies with artificiallyAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 48contaminated chicken drumsticks demonstrated that the use of cobalt-60 at 0.5 KGy effected a 99% reduction of C. jejuni.219However, there is doubt that irradiation would be acceptable to consumers in the UK at the present time. 4.50 Chemical treatments have also been examined, although under EU legislation, only potable water can be used in poultry processing plants. Dataon the effectiveness of chlorine are equivocal. One study with artificiallycontaminated chicken drumsticks demonstrated that the use of chlorine hadonly a negligible effect on C. jejuni .219In contrast, the addition of 25 ppm to wash water significantly reduced levels of naturally occurring cells of C. jejuni on whole chicken carcasses.220Improvements in poultry process hygiene, which included the use of chlorinated water sprays to limit microbialcontamination on equipment and working surfaces, and an increase in thechlorine concentrations in process water, significantly reduced Campylobacter levels on carcasses.221Immersion of carcasses in water containing 10% tri-sodium phosphate solution also brought about a 1.71log 10/gram reduction in Campylobacter levels.220The use of 1% lactic acid as a spray significantly reduced the levels of artificially inoculated cells of C. jejuni on chicken carcasses.222 Work is required to properly assess the efficacy of different treatments under commercial conditions. 4.51 One study has shown, perhaps not surprisingly, that the removal of the skin caused a significant reduction in Campylobacter levels on broiler carcasses.223 4.52 There has been quite a large body of work on the effects of either highor low temperatures on contamination levels. One study 224examined the effects of a number of hot water treatments on Campylobacter levels on carcasses, namely post-scalding, immersion for 28 seconds in water at60\u00b0C, and spraying with water at 70 \u00b0C. The treatments were chosen because they did not obviously change carcass appearance but they did not reduce Campylobacter levels. This is probably associated with the ability of this pathogen to attach to chicken skin.225In contrast, another study found that spraying with water at either 55 or 60 \u00b0C did reduce the numbers of C. jejuni by circa 0.8 log10per carcass.226This study used artificial contamination, and attachment to carcass surfaces is likely to be different from the naturalsituation. Scalding at 60 \u00b0C reduced the numbers of Campylobacter on chicken skin by > 2 log10.227In the UK, however, most carcasses are scalded at water at circa 50 \u00b0C, because they are destined for the fresh market. The above study found that scalding at this temperature had no effect on skincontamination levels with C. jejuni . The immersion of artificially inoculated broiler skin in water at 75, 80 or 85 \u00b0C for 10 seconds caused a significant reduction in C. jejuni levels, as did immersion for 20 seconds in water at either 80 or 85 \u00b0C. This study also investigated the effects of exposure to atmospheric steam at 90 \u00b0C for either 12 or 24 seconds. The former had no effect on Campylobacter levels while the latter did bring about a significant 49Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterfall in bacterial numbers.228The authors state that all treatments caused visible damage to the outer epidermal skin tissue. These data, and thoseabove, would suggest that treatment with high temperature is unlikely to beadopted for chickens to be sold with the skin on. Very similar results wereobtained from a recent study in the UK. 229This work also highlights a need to examine the effects of attachment on the heat resistance of Campylobacter spp. 4.53 A potentially more effective and commercially acceptable carcass treatment is the application of low temperature such as freezing, particularlywhere this could be applied to carcass surfaces in a transient manner so thatcarcass quality is not impaired. The storage of beef trimmings inoculatedwith C. jejuni at minus 18 \u00b0C for seven days caused reductions in pathogen levels of between 0.22-2.2 log10 cfu/g.230In a recent investigation, the effects of freezing on the numbers of C. jejuni on artificially contaminated chicken wings were examined. Storage at either minus 20 \u00b0C or minus 30 \u00b0C for 72 hours reduced pathogen numbers by 1.3 and 1.8-log10 cfu/g, respectively. The super-chilling of wings in liquid nitrogen, so that the meat did not fallbelow minus 3.3 \u00b0C, caused C. jejuni reductions of 0.5 log10 cfu/g on wings held at minus 80 \u00b0C, 0.8 log10 cfu/g on wings held at minus 120 \u00b0C, 0.6 log10 cfu/g on wings held at minus 160 \u00b0C and 2.4 log10 cfu/g on wings held at minus 196 \u00b0C.231It is of interest that the freezing of chicken carcasses was one of the factors identified as being associated with a reduction of human Campylobacter cases in Iceland.232 During 1999 in Iceland, domestic cases of campylobacteriosis reached peak levels. Approximately 62% of broilercarcass rinses were contaminated with Campylobacter in 1999, but during 2000, only 15% of the broiler flocks tested Campylobacter positive. In 2000, carcasses from flocks which tested positive on the farms at 4 weeks of agewere subsequently frozen prior to distribution. It was suggested that carcassfreezing, in combination with other measures such as public education andenhanced on-farm biological security measures, contributed to thesubsequent large reduction in poultry-borne campylobacteriosis. 4.54 All of the processing aids discussed above suffer from some defect or other e.g. they are not permitted to be used under EU law, they are not veryeffective in reducing Campylobacter loadings, or they are unacceptable to consumers. Other possibilities, like the use of ultra violet and electron beamradiation, are being explored, and their efficacy in a commercial setting andacceptability to consumers remain to be adequately demonstrated. While weremain firmly of the view that the focus of measures to combat Campylobacter should be centred on the farm, we do not seek to discourage the development of new technologies, either in terms of carcass treatments,or in innovative approaches to improved hygiene at slaughter. In this latterconnection, the ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group received information from Meyn BV about its work to improve hygiene at slaughter. Thecompany 's aim is to bring this about through a combination of betterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 50management of feed withdrawal, and improved mechanical processing of birds at slaughter. This involves reducing faecal contamination duringscalding and plucking, and improving the efficiency of evisceration. Thecompany has developed processing line equipment which, it claims, underspecified conditions yields reductions of 60-90% in Enterobacteriaceae onthe skin after plucking, 70-95% in the skin after plucking, and 50-95% in Enterobacteriaceae in scald water, compared with anidentical processing line not containing its equipment. Control of Campylobacter spp. in extensive chicken production 4.55 The focus of this Chapter is enhancing biosecurity as a way of reducing Campylobacter infection in housed birds. This reflects the importance of intensive production (some 96% of the 1.2 million tonnes ofchicken meat produced annually in the UK), and the fact that robustbiosecurity regimes are more easily applied in the intensive productionsetting. We recognise that extensive production (free range and organic) isnow a significant, albeit relatively minor, feature of the UK market, and wegive this some attention in Annex E. Organic and free range productionsystems place greater emphasis on giving birds access to the outdoors.Enhanced biosecurity measures which help reduce Campylobacter infection in intensive production systems may therefore be less effective when used inextensive production systems. There is general scientific agreement that theenvironment is the principal source of Campylobacter spp. in poultry, and it is not unreasonable to expect that birds with regular access to the externalenvironment will come into more frequent contact with Campylobacter . 4.56 There is some evidence that chickens which have access to the external environment are more likely to be Campylobacter -positive than intensively-reared birds. As yet unpublished Food Standards Agency-fundedresearch points in this direction as do studies from Denmark andelsewhere. 137,233-236However, because this evidence is not comprehensive, we believe that it would ultimately benefit consumers if structuredsurveillance were carried out in the UK both of the prevalence of Campylobacter in extensively-reared broiler flocks and the Campylobacter status of extensively-produced (including free range and organic) chicken meat. Conclusions 4.57 It is becoming clear that control of Campylobacter on-farm is now a practical proposition, at least with birds that are housed. We brought thisview to the attention of the Food Standards Agency in September 2002 toassist the Agency in developing its Campylobacter strategy.3The first commitment must be to rigorous biosecurity, combined with high standardsof stockmanship and attention to good flock health and stress control. This 51Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterwill involve such measures as restricting farm visits to essential personnel; ensuring visits are undertaken as hygienically as possible; and appropriatestaff training on flock infection. The control of Campylobacter on-farm presents a greater challenge than that associated with the control of Salmonella . 4.58 Our Campylobacter Working Group received different views, both formally and anecdotally, about the possibility of the UK poultry industryadopting 'Scandinavian style ' systems of on-farm biosecurity. Where these systems have been trialed in the UK, they have been seen to be successful,although industry argues that long-term maintenance would be difficult.While Scandinavian and UK systems of production and control measures dodiffer in some respects, reflecting the different sizes of the industries and thevery different climates, we firmly believe that the application of biosecurity,such as changing footwear, and other hygiene measures, will either delay orprevent the entry of Campylobacter into broiler flocks and thus reduce the incidence of colonised birds. Studies in the Netherlands support this view.177 Changing of footwear was found to be important in a UK context,187and another UK study found that frequent replenishment of boot dip disinfectantwas one of a few factors which reduced broiler flock infection by over50%. 186In the future, given current research effort, it may be possible to supplement biosecurity with pre- or probiotic approaches, competitiveexclusion, and/or vaccination. 4.59 In addition, it is clear that a well-run broiler farm can reduce the incidence of Campylobacter through adherence to a number of key principles. It should: be species mono-specific (ie. farm only chickens); supply the birds with water of potable quality; properly clean and disinfect houses after flock removal, whichshould include disinfection of the water supply system; protect the house from entry by wild birds and rodents; supply feed which has received treatment sufficient to haveeradicated Salmonella (and, hence Campylobacter ), and protect it from re-contamination; only carry out thinning if done in association with proper cratewashing (so that crates are not contaminated with Campylobacter spp. or other pathogenic microorganisms) and proper biosecurity measures covering eg. clothing andfootwear;Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 52ensure that transport crates and vehicles are cleaned and disinfected properly on every occasion; maintain general biosecurity and hygiene barriers at a highlevel, to prevent infection from the farm environment; only allow essential visits into the poultry houses; and make sure all personnel including visitors follow the hygienerules. 4.60 We strongly believe that concerted effort is needed by industry to improve the microbiological safety of thinning. If this cannot be achieved,then the case for discontinuing the practice, and taking the necessarymeasures to protect the welfare of stock, becomes very strong. 4.61 In risk assessment terms, a lower incidence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks is likely to be reflected in lower numbers of the organism inindividual birds in the flock and subsequently on finished carcases. Reducingthe number of Campylobacter -positive flocks can also be expected to have a significant impact on the numbers of contaminated carcases leaving theprocessing plant. Flock testing will facilitate the scheduling of slaughter ofknown positive flocks allowing birds from such flocks to be processed at theend of the day immediately prior to cleansing of the plant, reducing theopportunity for cross-contamination from the carcases of these birds. Itwould also offer the option of directing the processed carcases from positiveflocks to heat treatment or freezing if these were found to be helpful inreducing Campylobacter loadings. 4.62 We accept the advice we have received from various parts of the poultry industry that broiler chicken production is extremely pricecompetitive and that the industry is faced with continuing threats of importpenetration. 4.63 We do r ecognise that many of the measures for controlling Campylobacter in chicken imply additional production costs. However, there is increasing evidence that there are direct links between the general healthstatus of birds and their susceptibility to Campylobacter infection. In addition, the maintenance of good flock health conveys economic benefits.Measures put in place for the control of Campylobacter might also help reduce the risk of introducing other infections into the flock. 4.64 In order to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to tackle Campylobacter , good quality data are needed on the Campylobacter status both of flocks and retail product. Flock prevalence studies are an essentialfeature of any evaluation process, to establish a baseline and to monitor 53Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterprogress under commercial conditions. We believe that Defra should organise such studies. In addition, we assume that the Food StandardsAgency will continue to use routine surveillance of retail chicken for Campylobacter to assess the effectiveness of Campylobacter reduction programmes. The potential value of industry data as an output measureshould not be overlooked even if, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, suchinformation cannot be made publicly-available outside the FSA. We discussthe valuable contribution a standardised approach to typing can make totracing sources and routes of transmission of human Campylobacter infection in Chapter 9. 4.65 We recognise that free range and organic chicken production is now a small but significant feature of the UK market. Given the importance of theenvironment as a source of Campylobacter , we think it likely that chickens reared extensively will come into more frequent contact with Campylobacter and that robust biosecurity arrangements aimed at reducing the exposure of birds to Campylobacter spp. will be more difficult to apply in extensive production systems. It is important that consumers are aware of this, notleast because one of the main reasons given for buying free range andorganic chicken is that they see it as a healthier product. We believe thatinformation based on structured UK surveillance of Campylobacter infection in extensively-reared broiler flocks and the Campylobacter status of extensively-produced, including free range and organic, chicken meat wouldbe valuable in informing consumer choice. Means also need to be identifiedof controlling Campylobacter in extensive production systems. Recommendations 4.66 Our principal recommendation is that the Food Standards Agency utilises the conclusions we have drawn to intensify its work with thepoultry industry and other stakeholders to achieve wider acceptancethat Campylobacter control of housed birds is now possible. A primary aim should be to develop an industry-wide programme to spread the\"good farming \" practices and biosecurity measures which lie at the heart of the matter. (Priority A) 4.67 We recommend that the FSA, in collaboration with Defra, as appropriate, should explore with industry the options for modifyingthinning practices to reduce the threat to the biosecurity of broilerfarms. If the necessary improvements cannot be made, the FSA andDefra should explore with industry the conditions which would allow thepractice of thinning to be discontinued, notwithstanding the economicpressures to which industry has drawn attention. (Priority A).Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 544.68 If thinning is to continue, crate washing and other biosecurity measures (including clothing and footwear) need urgent improvement.We recommend that the FSA pursues this with stakeholders. (Priority A) 4.69 In or der to facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness of Campylobacter reduction measures, and to improve controls at slaughter, we recommend that Defra carries out surveillance of Campylobacter in broiler flocks. We also recommend that the FSA continues to perform routine surveillance of Campylobacter in retail chicken. (Priority A) 4.70 E xtensive chicken production is a minor but nevertheless important feature of the UK market. We believe that consumers wouldbenefit from knowing more about the Campylobacter status of this type of product. We therefore recommend surveillance: by Defra to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in extensively-reared flocks and the Campylobacter spp. involved; (Priority B) by the FSA to determine the Campylobacter status of free range, organic and other extensively-produced chickenmeat on retail sale in the UK. (Priority B) 4.71 We also recommend further research into how Campylobacter can be more effectively controlled in extensively-reared chickens. We note that the FSA is already considering funding research in this areaand welcome the fact that the Agency has invited Expressions ofInterest from researchers. 237 (Priority B) 55Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 56Measures to prevent Campylobacter contamination of chicken meat in Scandinavia Introduction 5.1 Animal and human health surveillance data, together with research reports, suggest that the incidence of Campylobacter in commercially-reared chickens in Scandinavia is lower than in the UK. In order to ascertain whetherthis was true, and to try to learn from the Scandinavian experience, a subgroup of Campylobacter Working Group members, comprising Professor Humphrey, Professor Johnston and Mr Kyriakides, together with the Group 's Scientific Secretary, Dr Back, visited Denmark and Norway from 17-21November 2002. The sub group deemed the visit a great success as itallowed the members to gain first hand knowledge of poultry production inthe two countries and to have detailed discussions with scientists, and withgovernment and poultry industry officials. Sub group members wish to placeon record their very grateful thanks to all the people, in both countries, whohelped to arrange the visit and particularly to those whom the sub group metduring the visit. 5.2 A report on the visit was submitted to the Food Standards Agency in January 2003 (see Annex C). Details are given in the following paragraphs.Information about the situation in Sweden, kindly provided by Dr EvaBerndtson (an ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group member) is also included in this Chapter. Denmark 5.3 The first day of the visit to Denmark was taken up with meetings and presentations, while the second day was devoted to a visit to a broiler farmand a processing plant. Human Campylobacter infection in Denmark 5.4 There were 4,620 recorded cases of human Campylobacter infection in Denmark in 2001, although the true figure is thought to be much higher,and similar to the incidence in the UK. The most significant sources ofinfection are: poultry meat; 57Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety Food: Second Report on Campylobacter Chapter 5pork and beef; polluted drinking water; and contact with cats and dogs. 5.5 The sub group was also presented with details of a contemporary epidemiological study identifying the following risk factors (Table 5.1): Table 5.1: Contemporary epidemiological study identifying risk factors 5.6 There is a much more pronounced summer peak in human infection than in the UK. The consumption of poultry meat is a significant risk factorand the Danes have carried out a risk assessment which shows that, wherethe number of Campylobacter on chicken carcasses is reduced by freezing or other means, the risk of human infection is also reduced. Campylobacter in Danish broiler flocks 5.7 All poultry flocks in Denmark are subject to surveillance to determine their Campylobacter status. Standard protocols are used throughout Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Control of Campylobacter in broiler flocks is closer to the current UK position (and less well developed than in Norway). 5.8 Some scepticism was expressed in Denmark about the possibilities for on-farm control. Very hot Danish summers present particular difficulties.It is not uncommon for some broiler houses to be left open in summer forwelfare reasons, and this would undermine biosecurity. The current aim istherefore to reduce flock colonisation rather than to eliminate it. Probablyreflecting perceived difficulties in on-farm control, there is a greater focus inDenmark on intervention during or after processing. Campylobacter is thought to be particularly sensitive to freezing and work is in hand on theeffects of freezing at -18\u00baC for 10 days. The efficacy of heat treatment (75 \u00baC for 15 seconds) is also being investigated. Current work suggests that thesetreatments bring about a 1.95 and 1.6-log reduction respectively in Campylobacter contamination levels.Risk factor Odds ratio Under-cooked poultry meat 4.5 Travel to a foreign country 2.5 Raw milk consumption 2.3 Red meat consumed at BBQs 2.3 Grapes 1.6Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 58Broiler farm visit 5.9 The sub group visited a farm supplying a major poultry processor, which was said to be typical of a good broiler farm in Denmark. It was acontract farm and had 7 houses, each containing 31,000 birds. The farmeroperated an all-in all-out system, although it took a number of days to clearthe site. The birds were approximately 21 days of age at the time of the visit,and mortality was higher than usual, due to a combination of Gumborodisease and a vitamin B deficiency in the parent flock. The farm was in goodorder and, although the houses were over 30 years old, they were in goodcondition. There were approximately 5-10 metres between houses, and thesite was coated with coarse gravel, which was routinely sprayed with weedkiller. There are broiler farms of a comparative standard in the UK. 5.10 The only intervention in place was a physical hygiene barrier about 40 cms high in each house with associated boot/protective clothing change. Awash hand basin was located away from the hygiene barrier and the housewas not entered via an enclosed anteroom (in contrast to the situationobserved at the Norwegian broiler farm visited by the sub group - see below). This set up was closely related to typical UK production, except forthe hygiene barrier which is largely absent in the UK. The rather rudimentaryhygiene precautions are sufficient to protect flocks outside of the summermonths. Poultry processing plant visit 5.11 The sub group visited a processing plant very similar to most in the UK. The company markets Campylobacter -free chickens, for which Danish consumers are prepared to pay a price premium. Danish legislation covering Campylobacter -free status requires that \"the flock shall be controlled to give a 95% guarantee that less than 1% of birds are infected withCampylobacter\". Three hundred samples per flock must be tested, although the company examined 500. The company has been involved in thedevelopment of a PCR method to provide information on Campylobacter status within 5 hours. The testing regime is as follows (Table 5.2): 59Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterTable 5.2: Commercial PCR testing protocol 5.12 Testing generates a variety of actions. Details are as follows: Table 5.3: Actions resulting from PCR testing Norway 5.13 Much of this leg of the visit was taken up with meetings with people largely responsible for the implementation of the Norwegian Action PlanAgainst Campylobacter in Broilers. Sub group members also gave presentations to an invited audience of around 100 people and also attendedan official reception at the residence of the British Ambassador. Human Campylobacter infection in Norway 5.14 There has been a marked increase in the number of human Campylobacter cases in Norway since 1997, the annual incidence being around 100 cases per 100,000 of the population. There is an approximate50:50 split between the number of cases acquired in Norway and thoseacquired abroad. There is a very marked peak in the incidence of humaninfection, with approximately 75% of cases occurring in July, August andPositive result Action Farm samples Flock slaughtered and packed without Campylobacter -free label. Slaughterhouse samples Chickens previously shown to be negative on the farm will be re-packed without the Campylobacter - free label.

If Campylobacter is detected repeatedly, the control programme will be evaluated with thefarm veterinarian.Control Samples Analysis Comments method At the farm 3 x fresh faeces PCR If Campylobacter - negative, the flock canbe slaughtered as Campylobacter -free.

It is thought that many more cases are caused by water in Norway than in the UK. The consumption of poultry purchased raw is amongthe principal risk factors although, unfortunately, authoritative data on thelevel of chicken-associated human cases prior to the introduction of broilerintervention arrangements are not available. Principal vehicles of infectionare: the consumption of non-disinfected water; the consumption of poultry purchased raw; attending outdoor barbeques; and professional contact with animals. 5.15 Given the rising incidence of human campylobacteriosis, and the association with the consumption of poultry meat, Norway has introduced anAction Plan Against Campylobacter in Broilers. The plan was developed by the Norwegian Zoonosis Centre and has three goals, namely to: reduce the human exposure to Campylobacter from Norwegian poultry; improve food safety; and reduce the incidence of human campylobacteriosis associatedwith Norwegian poultry. 5.16 The action plan has three elements: surveillance of live animals and animals at slaughter, in accordance with WHO recommendations; surveillance of poultry meat products; follow up of Campylobacter -positive farms, comprising standardised consultations and the introduction of measuresto reduce flock infection, namely the disinfection of drinkingwater and the introduction of physical hygiene barriers; a farm-based research programme to identify risk factors for Campylobacter infection in flocks. 61Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterCampylobacter in Norwegian broiler flocks 5.17 The industry is approximately 10% of the size of that in the UK and, in general, birds are killed at 32-33 days of age although, at the plant visited bythe sub group, older birds (c42 days) were also being processed. Norway hasa national programme for the surveillance of Campylobacter in poultry flocks, which is funded by the Government and the industry. Ten composite faecalsamples are collected on the farms 4-8 days before slaughter. If thesesamples are Campylobacter -positive, the birds are subject to hygienic slaughter at the end of the day. The carcasses are either heat-treated orfrozen for five weeks. The farmers will also receive a consultation. All flocksare also sampled at the slaughterhouse, with 10 cloacal swabs being taken.In some plants, breast feather swabs are also taken in the processing plantimmediately after killing. If these samples are Campylobacter -positive, the farmer will receive an advisory visit. 5.18 Data from Norway 's national surveillance programme indicate that, in 1991, the overall figure for Campylobacter -positive flocks was 18%, although there is very marked seasonal variability. By 1998, this figure hadfallen to 4%. The most recent surveillance data seen by the ACMSF(covering 2001-2002, and including two summers) show an annual, on-farmincidence figure of 7.6%. Many flocks became positive in the last week oflife, a phenomenon becoming increasingly common in the UK. The followingdata are taken from the latest surveillance: 3,444 flocks from 526 farms were surveyed; 133 farms Campylobacter -positive; 186 flocks (5.4%) were Campylobacter -positive; 49% of the positive flocks were only detected at slaughter; 71% of farms delivered only 1 Campylobacter -positive flock; and 7% of farms delivered 3 or more Campylobacter -positive flocks. 5.19 As with human infection, there is very marked seasonality, with some 90% of the positive flocks being identified in the summer months. Thefollowing table gives data from current risk analyses.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 62Table 5.4: Factors associated with the risk of Campylobacter in broiler flocks Broiler farm visit 5.20 The sub group visited a typical Norwegian broiler farm comprising 1 house containing approximately 11,000 birds. It was not possible toexamine the area surrounding the broiler house as it was covered in snow.The house was entered via an anteroom, which had 3 rooms, each withdoors, coming off it. One room served as an office and had a window throughwhich the flock could be observed. Access to the flock was via a room onthe other side of the anteroom, in which a physical hygiene barrier had beenplaced. There were dedicated overalls and footwear on the bird-side of thebarrier. This room also contained a wash hand basin which the farmer usedbefore putting on his protective clothing and footwear. All the evidenceavailable to the sub group would suggest that this simple intervention issufficient to protect the birds from Campylobacter colonisation in spring, autumn and winter and, to some extent, in summer. Some UK poultrycompanies have agreed to undertake collaborative research to examinewhether the Norwegian system of hygiene barriers could deliver the samebenefits in this country. A small trial found that one UK farmer was able toproduce 5 Campylobacter -negative flocks in succession. 5.21 The sub group visited a poultry processing plant which was typical of most in Europe, and which employed no devices which were not already inuse in the UK. The plant was smaller and much tighter for space than UKplants. Water usage seemed higher than in the UK. Also, in contrast to theUK, birds were spray-chilled with cold water. Although Norway does notmarket Campylobacter -free poultry at retail, the goal is to reduce the level of Campylobacter in broiler chickens at slaughter to as close to zero as possible. Campylobacter in fresh poultry products 5.22 The prevalence of Campylobacter contamination in fresh poultry products in Norway ranged between 4 and 10% over the period 1995-98.Variable Category Odds ratio Using tractor to place litter Yes 3.1 in the broiler house No 1.0 Physical hygiene barrier Yes 1.0 at entrance to chickens No 4.2Routines for hand-washing Always 1.0 Never/sometimes 3.3 Water source Private well 3.6 Other private source 2.1Public source 1.0 63Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterFurther surveys of fresh poultry products were carried out in 2001 (at production facilities) and 2002 (in shops). Just over 1,000 samples weretaken in each survey. Campylobacter prevalence was <10% in 2001 and around 2% in 2002. Sweden 5.23 Sweden is a very important element in any consideration of Scandinavian broiler production. The ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group was very fortunate to have as a member, Dr Eva Berndtson who is Campylobacter Consultant to the Swedish Poultry Association. Dr Berndtson has been able to supply information about the situation in Sweden. Human Campylobacter infection in Sweden 5.24 Human cases of Campylobacter infection in Sweden are increasing. Five-year trend data are given in Table 5.5. 5.25 Of the cases in 2001 where information is available about the country of infection, 4,884 were infected abroad. In 861 cases, it was not possible todetermine the country of infection. The countries most commonly identifiedas the source of infection were Thailand (1,045 cases), Spain (984), Morocco(310), Turkey (212), Tunisia (176), Greece (164), France (154), India (143),Indonesia (135) and Egypt (113). Table 5.5: Notified cases of human Campylobacter infection in Sweden Source: Swedish Institute of Infectious Disease Control 5.26 With the exception of some large waterborne outbreaks, chicken meat is regarded as the most common source of Campylobacter infection acquired in Sweden. During 2002, there were 2,453 clinically reported casesacquired in Sweden. In most of these, no suspected source of infection wasidentified. For those where a suspected source was identified, the mostcommon risk factors mentioned were:Year Total Acquired in Sweden Total incidence (100,000 population) 1997 6,881 1,430 77.8 1998 of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 64eating chicken meat (351 cases); poultry contact at work or at home (46); lake/stream water (31); domestic well water (27); and raw milk (9 cases). Campylobacter in Swedish broiler flocks 5.27 Table 5.6 shows the percentage of Swedish broiler flocks positive for Campylobacter over the period 1993-2000. Data are also shown for part of the year 2001. The peak periods for infection, based on blocks of 4 weeks,runs from periods 7 to 10, during which the number of broiler flocks positivefor Campylobacter ranged from around 10% to nearly 40%. Annualised flock prevalence data are given in Table 5.7. Characteristics of Swedish broiler industry 5.28 At the time of writing, the Swedish broiler industry comprises 7 companies with 8 slaughterhouses and a total of 124 farms withapproximately 500 broiler houses in total. Average flock size is around30,000 birds (maximum 50,000). The newer farms generally have flocks of50,000 birds and 2-4 houses or compartments. 5.29 Broiler houses are classified for welfare purposes in Sweden and stocking density is a key feature of the classification arrangements. Only thebest houses are permitted to be stocked to the maximum density (36kg/m 2). Most houses are stocked to a density of at least 33 kg/m2. Stocking density in houses with low welfare scores is restricted to 20kg/m2. 5.30 As noted in Chapter 4, data190,193suggest that Campylobacter spp. in dry litter may be less infectious than in wet litter. A reduction in Campylobacter infection in flocks has been seen to correlate with litter dryness, and further improvements were seen when Swedish farmers beganusing scoring of foot pads as a parameter for adjusting the density of birdsin a shed. The checking of the feet of birds at slaughter is a feature of theSwedish classification system. If the foot pads are in poor condition, lowerdensity stocking is imposed for subsequent flocks. This serves as anincentive on farmers to keep litter very dry. 65Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterTable 5.6: Campylobacter in Swedish broiler flocks Source: Swedish Poultry Meat Association Table 5.7: Percentage of Swedish broiler flocks positive forCampylobacter Source: Swedish Poultry Meat Association 5.31 Biosecurity features include the requirement to change clothing and footwear at the entrance to each house, and an all in-all out productionsystem across the entire farm. While there are significant differences in thefrequency of Campylobacter flock infection between companies, taking year 2000 as an example, almost half of all farms had no Campylobacter -positive flocks. 5.32 A feature of Sweden 's programme to reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks is that the worst affected farms receive visitsYear % broiler flocks Year % broiler Campylobacter -positive Campylobacter -positive 1992 13.3 1997 9.8 1993 12.4 1998 9.1 1994 13.6 1999 9.2 1995 14.3 2000 9.9 1996 9.34 week period No. Percentage flocks Campylobacter -positive 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 1 9 6 903513 1 0 2 1 0 9 1 312412 8 3 6 3 1 232511 9 4 1 1 8 952212 6 5 5 5 742748 1 1 6 7 12 10 6 2 5 12 12 12 7 1 8 1 4 81 3 91 41 51 87 8 2 8 2 5 1 81 41 61 22 51 8 9 2 3 4 1 3 71 82 52 52 22 0 10 17 24 24 22 27 19 21 14 11 16 14 16 12 17 15 14 11 12 14 4 11 10 12 2 1 12 1 3 2 01 2 7 1 16347Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 66from veterinary advisers. The overall aim of the programme is to reduce flock prevalence to below 2%. This would open the way for positive birds to beidentified for special processing (eg. heat treatment). For this to workeffectively, there will be a need for a quick and reliable method of identifying Campylobacter -positive flocks before slaughter. There is also a potential logistical difficulty in that there are often significant distances between broilerfarms and slaughterhouses. Travelling time regulations thus make it difficultto re-route positive birds. Campylobacter in Swedish fresh poultry products 5.33 The Committee has seen no published data on Campylobacter contamination levels in fresh poultry products at retail in Sweden. However, levels are thought to reflect those seen at slaughter plants (ie. 10-17%). Conclusions from Denmark visit 5.34 Overall, the sub group concluded that the current situation in Denmark was quite close to that in the UK, although intervention has been attemptedfor much longer. The Danes seemed to have derived a real benefit, in termsof the quality of data produced, from closer integration of the human andanimal health surveillance systems. It was also apparent that regular nationaltesting of poultry flocks yielded important information about Campylobacter prevalence and seasonality, as well as about geographical differences in colonisation rates. The Danish research community has offered access toperformance and flock health data on 25,000 flocks, which can be correlatedwith Campylobacter status. Conclusions from Norway visit 5.35 The sub group felt that Norway provided some useful indications of what could be achieved by targeted on-farm intervention. Physical hygienebarriers seemed a cheap and effective counter-measure which the UKindustry should be pressed to adopt as a matter of urgency. The ratherdifferent epidemiology of infection in Norwegian broilers, compared to thosein the UK, could indicate a particular source of infection in the summer andthe possible involvement of contaminated air in its transmission. Thepotential for airborne transmission on farms may need further investigation.This could necessitate some quite detailed research. Overall conclusions from Denmark/Norway visits 5.36 The ACMSF 's overall conclusions drawn from the sub group 's visits to Denmark and Norway are that: nothing that the sub group saw in either Denmark or Norwayserved to undermine the Committee 's views, set out in 67Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterChapter 4, on the feasibility of the on-farm control of Campylobacter in housed chickens; indeed, the Norwegian experience especially offered further encouragement that on-farm control in housed birds isachievable on a commercial scale; Denmark appears to have established a premium market for Campylobacter -free chicken; Norway has succeeded in getting the contamination rate for fresh chicken products in retail outlets down below 10%; the UK broiler industry still has some catching up to do but is,for the most part, on the right track; however, the UK industry needs to be encouraged to maintainits best endeavours; opportunities for collaboration between researchers here andthose in Denmark and Norway were identified; some thought needs to be given to the efficacy and widerimplications of heat treating or freezing Campylobacter - positive carcasses; the potential for airborne transmission of Campylobacter on farms may need further investigation but could necessitatesome quite detailed research. Conclusions from Sweden 's experience 5.37 Sweden has succeeded in reducing overall Campylobacter infection in flocks to below 10%. It is encouraging that, within this figure, around half ofall broiler farms were able to keep Campylobacter out of flocks completely. The methods used to achieve these results (eg. robust biosecurity, dry litter)are not innovative and are readily applicable to the UK setting. Thisinformation about the situation in Sweden provides further support for theobservations made and the conclusions drawn by members of the sub groupfollowing their visit to Denmark and Norway.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 68Campylobacter in poultry other than chicken Introduction 6.1 In relation to poultry, chickens are the main focus of this Report. Also, the market share for broiler birds (860m) in the UK is higher than that ofturkeys (29m) and ducks (20m) and broilers are consumed more often. Thisreflects the importance of chicken meat in terms of production, trade andconsumption. However, all commercial poultry species can be colonised with Campylobacter spp. and products derived from them can also be contaminated with this pathogen. Campylobacter prevalence in ducks and turkeys 6.2 A survey in the USA found that 88% of ducks were positive for Campylobacter jejuni compared to 24% for chickens.238A study in Kenya found Campylobacter in 29% of healthy ducks and in 52% of healthy chickens.239Surveillance in Portugal demonstrated the presence of Campylobacter spp in 60 and 41% of chickens and ducks respectively.240 6.3 Campylobacter spp. are also found in turkeys.241,242A study on one farm in the UK found that all turkeys examined were Campylobacter -positive between 14-21 days after hatching.243 Campylobacter in foods 6.4 Surveys of foods at retail outlets also permit a comparison of Campylobacter contamination levels in different types of poultry. A US survey recovered Campylobacter from 57% of chicken samples and from 17% of game bird samples, but Campylobacter was found only infrequently in turkey.244Another US survey found Campylobacter in 71% and 14% of chicken and turkey samples respectively.245Another US survey compared anti-microbial resistance profiles of poultry-derived Campylobacter isolates and found higher levels of resistance in strains from turkey compared tochicken. 246 69Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter Chapter 6Conclusions 6.5 Such evidence as we have seen suggests that all commercial poultry species are as susceptible as chicken to Campylobacter colonisation. However, we note that there appears to be little hard information availableabout the UK situation, and most of the data quoted in this Report comefrom abroad. Recommendation 6.6 We recommend that, in addition to the work it is doing on chicken meat, the FSA carries out surveillance to establish the Campylobacter status of other types of poultry meat on retail sale in the UK. (Priority A)Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 70Measures to prevent Campylobacter contamination of meat other than chicken and other poultry meat Introduction 7.1 As noted in Chapter 3, while poultry meat is an important source of human Campylobacter infection, many studies point to numerous other sources and vehicles of infection. Campylobacter levels in animals 7.2 Campylobacter spp. frequently occur in the gut flora and faeces of animals used for food production such as cattle, pigs and sheep. Informationon the proportion of these animals carrying the organism is not extensive andwhat there is must be treated with some caution as a variety of methods andsampling regimes are likely to have been used. However, it is clear that ratescan be high, in some cases as high as those reported for chickens. Onesource of information is the annual European Commission Report on Trendsand Sources of Zoonotic Agents in the European Union and Norway. 247While information on carriage rates of Campylobacter is limited, a handful of European countries has provided data indicating carriage rates ranging from0.4-72.4% in cattle, from 45.3-94.5% in pigs, and from 13-24.8% in sheepand lamb. The levels between countries, and indeed within countries whendifferent years are compared, vary significantly. 7.3 Information on faecal carriage rates in the UK can be found in the annual Zoonoses Report published by Defra. The 2000 report 248gives the results of a survey of cattle, sheep and pig faeces in Great Britain, carried outin 1999/2000. This found: 94.5% of 860 pigs positive for , the predominant species being Campylobacter coli (84%); 24.5% of 891 cattle positive for coli , Campylobacter jejuni and accounting for more than half the positives; 17% of 973 sheep positive for Campylobacter , C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari accounting for over 90% of positives. 71Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter Chapter 77.4 The results outlined above provide a baseline against which to measure any changes in prevalence and types of Campylobacter when similar surveys are carried out in the future. We are aware that Defra, inassociation with other Government Departments, is in the process ofrepeating this survey. We welcome this. It is important that up-to-dateinformation on carriage rates in food animals is maintained. Campylobacter levels in meat 7.5 Leaving aside chickens and other poultry, although it is clear that there can be high gut and faecal carriage rates in animals, the available informationindicates that these often do not carry through to the associated meats onretail sale. However, the data are very variable and high figures have beenreported for some products. For example, 23.6% of 127 samples of beefmeat were positive for Campylobacter in a 1989 UK survey.249A further UK study250has reported contamination rates of 72.9 and 71.7% respectively in lambs ' and pigs ' liver. Data from other surveys carried out in the UK and the USA show C. jejuni and C. coli in a variety of retail meats ranging from 0 to 18.4%.249A study of campylobacters in, inter alia , samples of food on retail sale in the Reading area of the UK produced Campylobacter positives in a variety of meats sampled, ranging from 2.3 to 47%.251In Belgium, sampling of retail cuts of pork over the period 1997-1999 produced prevalence ratesof between 2.6 and 12.5% of samples. In a Belgian survey of retail beef in1997, 5% of samples were Campylobacter -positive.247A US study245 reported low levels of contamination in pork (1.7%) and beef (0.5%). The ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group was provided with data from surveys, carried out by a leading UK multiple food retailer, of Campylobacter in the company 's raw meat products on retail sale. No Campylobacter was found in 147 samples of fresh retail cuts of beef (53 samples), lamb (69) andpork (25) in February 2002. Nor was Campylobacter detected in 56 samples of fresh and frozen retail minced/reformed beef (41, of which 12 frozen), lamb(3, all fresh) and pork (12, all frozen) in March 2002. Finally, Campylobacter was also absent from 102 samples of fresh retail whole cuts of beef (39), lamb (36, of which 6 frozen) and pork (27) in September 2002. 7.6 Given the variations noted in the prevalence of Campylobacter in retail meat samples, it is very difficult to form any meaningful view on the risk topublic health in the UK from such products. What is required is large-scale,structured surveillance of Campylobacter in red meat on retail sale. Control of Campylobacter 7.7 The fact that the high carriage rates in red meat animals prior to slaughter does not always carry through to the final product is not perhapssurprising. Compared to poultry, there are significant differences in the waythat animals such as cattle, pigs and sheep are reared, transported andslaughtered. There are control measures in place which minimise faecalAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 72contamination of hides and fleeces, and hence Campylobacter contamination of carcasses during dehiding and evisceration. That said, in comparison to other enteric organisms, Campylobacter is rarely found on carcasses. Although this is thought to be due to the surface conditions, it ispossible that isolation methods used in studies are not optimal. We note thatthe Food Standards Agency (FSA) is investigating this question. 7.8 Implementation of control measures in the UK is the responsibility of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) in Great Britain and the Department ofAgriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland (NIDARD). MHS andNIDARD are responsible for ensuring that operators fulfil their duty to haveappropriate hygiene controls in place at licensed slaughterhouses, cuttingplants and cold stores handling red meat. Control measures comprise fourmain stages: ante mortem inspection of animals; checking on maintenance by the operator of hygienic process control throughout all stages of slaughter and processing; post mortem inspection of carcasses; and health marking. Each of these stages plays an important role in minimising the risk to public health from pathogens such as Campylobacter . Ante mortem control in cattle and sheep 7.9 In respect of ante mortem controls for cattle and sheep, a major advance in improving meat hygiene was the introduction in 1997 of the MHSClean Livestock Policy (CLP). bThe background to this was the recognition that, if the hide or fleece was contaminated with dung or dirt at the time ofslaughter, there was a very real risk of the meat becoming contaminated withharmful bacteria. Even the highest standards of abattoir hygiene cannot beguaranteed to prevent contamination of the carcass and cross-contamination of nearby carcasses. Research results have shown that thedirtier the hide, the greater the potential for carcass contamination and thehigher the human health risk. Wet hides and fleeces also increase the risk. 7.10 The CLP provides a cleanliness classification system which places animals presented by the operator for slaughter into one of five categories.Animals in categories 1 and 2, ie. those considered to be clean and dry, canbe slaughtered for human consumption. Animals in categories 3 and 4 mayonly be slaughtered for human consumption after the animal has received 73Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter bThe CLP does not apply to pigs and there are no categories of cleanliness. However, under the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995, an MHS Official Veterinary Surgeon may require the detentionin a lairage, or prohibit the slaughter, of any animal which is so dirty it would be likey to prevent hygienicdressing operations if taken into a slaughterhouse.special attention (eg. clipping or being allowed to dry in overnight lairage). Alternatively, other measures such as slowing the line speed to enablehygienic slaughter may be appropriate. Animals in category 5 are unsuitablefor slaughter for human consumption. Such animals are killed separately anddisposed of as an animal by-product. The CLP is operated by MHS andNIDARD staff who are able to reject for slaughter any animal that does notmeet the required standards of cleanliness. 7.11 At the time the CLP scheme was launched, research was put in place to study the factors involved in producing cattle that were both visibly andmicrobiologically clean. The output from this work was the launch by the FSAin 2003 of an initiative on Clean Cattle and Meat Safety. 252This initiative, which was produced in consultation with stakeholders, highlights 10 keymessages for producing clean cattle. These are disseminated viapromotional literature and a series of events aiming to provide advice tofarmers, livestock hauliers, veterinarians, abattoir managers, butchers andretailers. Hygiene control during slaughter 7.12 Compliance with hygiene legislation is the responsibility of plant operators. However, MHS and NIDARD staff work with plant operators toensure that hygiene controls to minimise the risk of cross-contamination aremaintained throughout the slaughter process. Specifically, the MHS andNIDARD enforce legislative requirements aimed at making sure that premisesoperate to recognised hygiene standards. Failure to meet these requirementsmay result in enforcement action against premises, and this could ultimatelylead to prosecution and suspension and/or revocation of their licence tooperate. Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) 7.13 The ACMSF is a strong supporter of HACCP and we championed its cause in our Report on Poultry Meat.171One of the major changes in relation to hygiene in red meat plants was the introduction of The Meat (HazardAnalysis and Critical Control Point) Regulations 2002, 253which require operators to put in place hygiene procedures based on HACCP principlesand to undertake microbiological checks. To aid plants in introducingHACCP , the FSA has produced a range of materials, including: HACCP guidelines252- a booklet explaining what the seven principles of HACCP are and how the legal requirements canbe complied with in general terms; Meat Plant HACCP Manual252- produced with the benefit of feedback from pilot plants, this manual has been sent to alloperators and their Official Veterinary Surgeons (OVSs);Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 74a CD-ROM version of the manual containing extra material including video clips, sample documentation and some modelHACCP plans. 252 newsletters - a number have been issued, providing advice and information on implementation of the Regulations.252 Microbiological testing 7.14 The Meat (HACCP) Regulations 2002253also introduce a requirement for microbiological testing in red meat plants, with the need to undertakeboth carcass tests (for Aerobic Colony Counts and Enterobacteriaceae )and surface tests (for Aerobic Colony Counts). The purpose of this testing is verymuch to look for trends, with plants using the results to identify the need tomake improvements in slaughter hygiene or cleaning and disinfectionprocesses. To assist operators and laboratories, the FSA has produced draftguidelines on microbiological testing - a booklet explaining how to undertake the sampling, testing calculation and expression of results. Post mortem inspection and health marking 7.15 Individual carcasses are assessed through post-mortem inspection. Any visible faecal contamination must be trimmed off before a carcass canbe presented as safe, wholesome and fit for sale for human consumption. 7.16 Fresh meat for sale for human consumption produced in licensed slaughterhouses must carry an official health mark. This indicates that thecarcass has passed ante and post-mortem inspection and that hygiene regulations have been complied with. 7.17 We note that changes are proposed to the EU 's rules governing meat and poultry inspections in slaughterhouses. The current rules are based onthe principle of individual inspection and, where necessary, palpation andincision of lymph nodes, offal and carcass meat, supplemented whereapplicable by bacteriological, parasitological or chemical examination. 7.18 Important features of the proposed new arrangements include all red meat animals and poultry having to be accompanied to slaughter by \"chain information \" supplied by the farmer. This will be information relevant to food safety, such as previous post-mortem inspection findings in respect of animals from the same herd, flock or holding, and the status of the herd orflock in relation to a zoonosis which is subject to monitoring (eg. the Salmonella status of a pig herd). If this information is not available, the animals will be slaughtered but their meat will be excluded from thefood chain. 75Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter7.19 Unnecessary post-mortem inspections for some conditions may not have to be carried out, where area or herd-based guarantees of freedomfrom disease can be provided. Post-mortem handling of carcasses and offal will be progressively minimised, following advice from the European FoodSafety Authority on appropriate procedures for individual types of animal. Ante and post-mortem inspection findings of significance for public health (or animal health and welfare) will be required to be collected andcommunicated to public and animal health officials as appropriate, as well asto the farmer of origin of the stock and his/her veterinary surgeon. 7.20 Among the perceived advantages of the new proposals over the current meat inspection system are that, in extending official controls to theentire food chain, they allow controls to be made at the most effective pointsalong the chain; in allowing only those animals with a known history to beslaughtered for human consumption, they will provide traceability and allowprocedures to be put in place to manage identified risks (eg. slaughtering agroup of animals last in the day, followed by a total clean down of theslaughterline so as to avoid cross-contamination); and in providing a riskbasis for post-mortem procedures, they will reduce incision and palpation of otherwise normal but infected carcasses, and prevent resultantcontamination and cross-contamination of meat. Conclusions 7.21 Campylobacter spp., including those which cause human disease, are likely to be widespread in the environment, and it is not surprising that foodproducing animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs are exposed to thisorganism. In terms of risk management, it seems sensible to assume that allflocks and herds will contain animals which are likely to be colonised with Campylobacter and to take steps during the slaughter process to minimise the likelihood that these are transferred to the final products leaving theplant. The control measures required to achieve this aim will be essentiallythe same for Campylobacter as for organisms such as Salmonella and VTEC. We do not therefore consider that there is a need for Campylobacter -specific measures. 7.22 We recognise that both Government and industry have developed and put in place a number of measures to minimise the possibility of faecalmaterial being transferred from the gut (or indeed the hide and fleece) duringthe slaughter process. We believe that, if properly applied, these will providean effective barrier against Campylobacter contamination.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 767.23 Cross-contamination is a potential risk and opportunities for cross- contamination should be avoided in relation to Campylobacter . We believe that the proposed new EU meat inspection requirements, by reducing theuse of palpation and incision, will help reduce the risk of cross-contamination. We agree that improving the flow of information across thefood chain is likely to assist traceability and facilitate application of diseasecontrol and food hygiene measures at the most effective points. We believethe number of red meat carcasses at risk from cross-contamination will belower than for poultry. 7.24 We believe that the quality of the information trail would be further enhanced if Campylobacter flock prevalence data were available at slaughter. We address this is Chapter 4. Recommendations 7.25 In view of the variations noted above in the prevalence of Campylobacter in retail meat samples, and in order to obtain a clearer picture of the risk if any to public health from such products, we recommend that the Food Standards Agency should undertake UK wide, large-scale,structured surveillance of the prevalence of Campylobacter in red meat on retail sale . (Priority A) We note that the Agency has recently requested pilot work in this area. 77Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 78Measures to prevent Campylobacter cross-contamination in domestic and catering environments Risk factors for Campylobacter infection 8.1 In assessing the relative importance of domestic and catering practices in controlling Campylobacter , it is recognised that most incidents of infection with these bacteria do not form part of outbreaks (0.4% casesbetween 1995 and 1999 were outbreak-associated) and the causes ofincidents are not clearly understood. 100In the Study of Infectious Intestinal Disease (IID) conducted in England in 1995, one of only two factors identifiedas significant in elevating the risk of campylobacteriosis was theconsumption of chicken at restaurants. 110,254The other factor was travel abroad. Modes of transmission and outbreak settings 8.2 Investigation of the 50 outbreaks of campylobacteriosis in England and Wales between 1995 and 1999 identified, as modes of transmission, 35(70%) foodborne; 4 (8%) person-to-person; and 9 (18%) unknown. 100 Outbreaks mainly occurred in commercial catering premises (32/50, 64%)including 16 in restaurants, 10 in hotels, 4 in public houses or bars and 1 ineach of a hall and canteen. The majority of the remainder occurred in schools(12%) and the armed services (8%). Of the 35 foodborne outbreaks, poultryproducts (13 chicken and 1 duck) were the most commonly identified likelyvehicles. The reasons identified as contributing to the outbreaks includedcross-contamination (18 outbreaks), inadequate heat treatment (10outbreaks), and inappropriate storage (7 outbreaks). Raw poultry meat as source of Campylobacter infection 8.3 Although a variety of animals, environments and foods are recognised as potential sources of Campylobacter spp., the most significant known source is raw poultry (whole or portioned, fresh and frozen), and chicken, inparticular. Other raw foods, such as red meat, are also known to becontaminated with Campylobacter , but neither the levels nor the incidence in retail products appear to compare with those found in raw poultry.Nevertheless, raw foods such as meat are, like poultry and will continue forthe foreseeable future to be, sources of Campylobacter into domestic and catering premises. Such foods must therefore be recognised at all times as 79Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter Chapter 8presenting a risk if not adequately cooked, or if they come into contact with ready-to-eat foods. 8.4 Raw chicken is known to be contaminated with Campylobacter spp. at a high frequency, often in excess of 50%.7,255In addition, the levels of the organism reported on fresh chicken carcasses can exceed 100,000 colonyforming units (cfu). 7 Tackling Campylobacter in domestic and catering environments Excluding Campylobacter from domestic and catering environments 8.5 Given the often low infectious dose of the organism, with as little as 500 cells having been reported to be capable of causing an infection, foodssuch as raw chicken entering a domestic or catering facility represent asignificant cross-contamination and in turn, infection, risk. 1With levels of over 100,000 cfu on some chicken carcasses, as little as 0.5% of the originalcontaminants need to be transferred to a ready-to-eat food to cause apotential infection, and it is almost inevitable that even minor lapses in foodhygiene practices will result in cross-contamination. Any attempt to reduce Campylobacter infections must address the high levels entering the food supply chain and kitchen, as well as the practices that should be in place indomestic and kitchen settings to destroy or prevent contamination with theorganism. Indeed, a quantitative risk assessment of humancampylobacteriosis associated with thermophilic Campylobacter spp. in chicken estimated that in order to achieve a 30-fold reduction in humandisease, kitchen hygiene would have to improve by approximately 30-fold,whereas a reduction in the number of the Campylobacter on chicken carcasses by 2-log cfu would achieve the same effect.256 Temperature abuse 8.6 Campylobacter spp. do not grow at temperatures below approximately 300C and are not believed to be especially heat resistant. We have previously reported the factors affecting the growth and survival of Campylobacter in foods.1As Campylobacter cannot grow at ambient and sub-ambient temperatures, the main risk in the domestic and cateringkitchen will be associated with cross-contamination of raw foods to ready-to-eat foods, either directly or indirectly from hands and worksurfaces/kitchen utensils, and undercooking of contaminated raw foods. Notwithstanding the fact that Campylobacter cannot grow at temperatures below 300C, we stress the importance of preventing temperature abuse by keeping hot foods at elevated temperaturese.g. >63 0C, or cooling them rapidly to temperatures precluding the growth of many pathogenic microorganisms e.g. 50C or less .Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 80Effective cooking 8.7 One of the most important intervention measures employed to control the organism is effective cooking. Campylobacter is not heat resistant and is readily destroyed by pasteurisation temperatures applied to milk (71.70C, 15 seconds) and meat (700C, 2 minutes). Previous advice given to producers and caterers on the heat processing requirements to ensure safety of cookedmeat (70 0C for 2 minutes or an equivalent temperature) still remain valid.257 In the catering environment, it is essential that effective controls are put inplace to guarantee that raw foods likely to be contaminated with Campylobacter are cooked to the correct temperature and time to destroy the organism. We believe that the proper and hygienic use of suitable meatthermometers in the catering and domestic settings would yield real benefitsin terms of ensuring effective cooking. The benefits of meat thermometersshould be more widely communicated. The Food Standards Agency mayalso, as part of its review of HACCP implementation in the catering sector,wish to consider whether documentary evidence of effective temperaturecontrol checks should be required to be kept. 8.8 As noted in Chapter 3, poultry liver consumption has been identified as a risk factor for human campylobacteriosis, 116as has eating raw or rare chicken.117-119Consumers need to recognise that a current culinary trend of serving poultry liver 'pink' means that any Campylobacter present will not have been destroyed. We received anecdotal evidence of an even moreworrying development, namely the addition of undercooked material andblood to poultry liver dishes to enhance the pinkness. This is clearly highlyundesirable and dangerous from a food safety perspective. Manufacturers ' instructions 8.9 On-pack instructions are usually present on pre-packaged food to give guidance on the conditions necessary to ensure effective cooking. Inour Report on Poultry Meat, 171we recommended that 'the food industry should introduce more informative labelling, in relation to raw, flash-friedpoultry products, in order to make clear to consumers that such productsrequire thorough cooking '. Cooking instructions, although offering guidance only, must be generated using appropriate, calibrated equipment and undercontrolled conditions, in order to be as precise as possible. Best practice forgeneration of such advice is available through some research associations,but it is not published or widely available. This needs to be remedied.Industry guidance produced through trade associations would help ensure aconsistent approach to the generation of on-pack cooking instructions. Suchinstructions need to be displayed prominently on the packaging. In addition,it is not common practice for foods purchased over the counter (butchers,meat counters, etc) to be labelled with cooking instructions. Thought needsto be given to how appropriate cooking guidance can be provided for suchproducts, and industry should examine the feasibility of providing cookingguidance on all raw meat and poultry products, including those sold fromservice counters, butchers and similar outlets. 81Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterCross-contamination 8.10 Once a food is cooked, every effort must be made to prevent it becoming re-contaminated with Campylobacter . A variety of sources offer opportunities for post-process contamination in the kitchen or cateringpremises, including people, pets, raw foods, and the environment. 8.11 Campylobacter has been found to be readily spread in the kitchen during preparation of raw foods such as chicken, and studies examiningconsumer behaviour in the kitchen have shown that practices likely to leadto cross-contamination of Campylobacter from raw foods, especially chicken, to ready-to-eat foods are common.258-260One study involving the observation of 108 consumers from all socio-economic backgrounds makingprescribed meals found 58% occurrence of the handler not washing theirhands after handling raw meat/poultry. 258In the same study, one-third of consumers washed raw chicken, and 15% failed to cook foods to atemperature of at least 74 0C. A questionnaire/interview-based study of 1,030 consumers assessing practices in relation to the handling of raw meatidentified that the majority routinely washed raw meat, with whole chickenbeing the highest (80%). 259 8.12 Research has shown that Campylobacter can be spread significant distances in the kitchen and improvements in isolation techniques havedemonstrated that the bacteria can also survive for long periods of time. 14 The exact risk that this presents clearly depends on the levels of theorganism and the likelihood of it contaminating a ready-to-eat food but,nevertheless, any practice which spreads these organisms within the kitchenshould be minimised. Washing raw meat and poultry is likely to spread Campylobacter in the kitchen through splashes, droplets and aerosols and should be actively discouraged. Campylobacter may also be found on the outside of chicken packaging, especially if leakage of blood has occurred,and the industry is encouraged to continue efforts to reduce leakage frompre-packaged raw poultry products through more effective packaging andseal integrity. 8.13 In a study of the cross-contamination potential of Campylobacter during the preparation of Sunday lunch made from raw chicken, 25 participants were allowed to prepare a meal in their own kitchens. Of the 11where Campylobacter was isolated from the raw chicken, the organism was recovered from hands (3), oven handles (2), counter tops (3) and the drainingboard (4) following preparation of the chicken. 261 8.14 We note with interest the UK national survey of in-use kitchen clothswhich failed to detect any Campylobacter in 1,009 cloths taken from homes in 2001.262The survey did, however, find other organisms, including Salmonella spp. (1 sample), Escherichia coli (367 samples) and Listeria monocytogenes (14 samples), indicating the potential for cloths to beAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 82colonised with microorganisms and become a vehicle for cross- contamination. 8.15 Levels of contamination with Campylobacter can be effectively reduced in the domestic kitchen by adherence to a prescribed cleaningregime using detergent, hot water and disinfectant. Some research hasshown that using the former two alone is less effective on surfacecontamination. 263 It is also clear that effective hand washing makes an important contribution to improving hygiene. A recent review determined thatwashing hands with soap could be expected to decrease the risk ofdiahhroeal disease in the community by almost half. 264 Hygiene advice 8.16 We note that, despite the existence of an industry code of practice,265 on-pack hygiene advice (with the exception of cooking instructions) is infrequently provided on food products such as raw meat and poultry, whichmay be contaminated with enteric pathogens. Some retailers provide foodsafety advice on such products, but this does not appear to be commonpractice. More needs to be done, and all producers and retailers of foodwhere pathogens such as Campylobacter may be present should provide advice on key safety steps. This should be applied as a minimum to rawpoultry products. Advice should include measures for effective cooking, andavoidance of cross-contamination. Washing raw poultry should bediscouraged. 8.17 Barbecued foods have frequently been highlighted as a potential risk factor for campylobacteriosis, although neither the Study of IID in England,nor the Campylobacter Sentinel Surveillance Scheme in England and Wales, found evidence to support this practice being significantly associated withinfection. 110,266Nevertheless, we believe that barbecuing raw meats, particularly poultry, represents an important potential risk, from cross-contamination when handling contaminated raw foods, and fromundercooking due to the use of poorly controlled or unfamiliar heatingsources/methods. The FSA has, in the past, provided targeted barbecuehygiene and cooking advice to consumers, and this should be repeated eachsummer. In addition, industry should provide food safety and hygiene adviceon the packaging for barbecues and raw meats intended for barbecuing. Companion animals 8.18 Risks in the domestic kitchen are also presented by companion animals which can carry Campylobacter spp. In one survey, the organism was isolated from 32% of faecal samples from dogs suffering diarrhoea.267 Moreover, surveys of consumer practices have shown that it is notuncommon for pets to remain in the kitchen during the preparation of ameal. 259,260The extent to which these animals also present a risk of 83Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterCampylobacter infection to their owners due to factors other than foodborne transmission e.g. stroking dogs, dogs licking people 's faces, etc., are not clear. An association was found between Campylobacter infection in dogs, and diarrhoea in human households, although this was not consideredstatistically significant. 267Indications from the Campylobacter Sentinel Surveillance Scheme do however reveal an elevated risk of infection (27cases per 100,000) associated with dog ownership, in comparison to otherpet ownership (0.7 cases per 100,000). 266 The FSA should consider how best to communicate the potential risks associated with the carriage of Campylobacter in companion animals and the hygienic precautions applicable to them. Food handlers 8.19 Any attempt to control Campylobacter in domestic and catering premises cannot overlook the importance of education and training of foodhandlers in the basic principles of food hygiene and safety. We are aware ofthe difficulties associated with ensuring adequacy of such knowledge in alarge and disparate population both in the home, and in catering where alarge number of the businesses employ few people (<10) and have a highstaff turnover. Catering businesses have a legislative obligation to providesafe food using a hazard analysis approach. Under revised European Unionhygiene legislation, which is likely to apply from 1 January 2006, they will berequired to put in place food safety management systems based on HACCPprinciples. Infected food handlers and ancillary staff working in food handlingareas are an important route of transmission of foodborne infections. Weaddressed this subject in some depth in Chapter 5 of our Report ofFoodborne Viral Infections 268and reiterate the importance of the advice given therein about pre-employment health assessment, good hygienepractice, and excluding from food handling areas staff who are ill. 8.20 We are encouraged by the continued efforts of the FSA to build food hygiene into its own promotional campaigns and, in collaboration with otherGovernment Departments, into education syllabuses. However, we believethat further measures are required in order to embed food hygiene and safetyprinciples into the education of primary and secondary school pupils. 8.21 We note the increased activity the Food Standards Agency has undertaken in recent months to highlight the need for adoption of effectivehygienic precautions in catering businesses, as part of its Food HygieneCampaign. We are aware of the intention to extend this to consumers and weendorse this approach. However, we feel that more needs to be done to drawattention to the enhanced risks associated with raw poultry. As basicprecautions may be insufficient to prevent Campylobacter cross- contamination from highly contaminated foods like raw chicken, the FSAshould consider how best to highlight to caterers and consumers theheightened risks associated with foods such as raw poultry.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 84Conclusions 8.22 Raw poultry meat, particularly chicken, is, and will continue for the foreseeable future to be, a significant vehicle by which Campylobacter is introduced into the domestic and catering environments. Levels of Campylobacter contamination of >105cfu are seen on some chicken carcasses. The human infectious dose is reported to be as low as 500 cells.Given the likely difficulties involved in controlling high levels of contaminationin the kitchen, especially from sources such as raw poultry, we reiterate thecritical significance of reducing the levels and incidence of Campylobacter on such products to lessen the burden on domestic and catering premises in dealing with such hazards. 8.23 If Campylobacter can be effectively tackled at the primary production stage, then the anticipated reduction in the number of Campylobacter cells reaching the kitchen would enhance the effectiveness of normal hygienemeasures taken there. We make a number of recommendations belowdesigned to enhance the effectiveness of action in the domestic and cateringenvironments. Recommendations 8.24 We strongly recommend the proper use in catering of meat thermometers, as a means of ensuring the effective cooking of rawpoultry products in particular. The use of such devices in the home mayalso yield benefits and we recommend that the Food Standards Agency(FSA) considers communicating the benefits of the use of cookingthermometers for domestic and catering settings. We also recommendthat, as part of its review of HACCP implementation in the cateringsector, the FSA considers whether documentary evidence of effectivetemperature checks should be required to be kept. (Priority A) 8.25 We recommend that industry guidance is produced through trade associations, to ensure a consistent approach to the generation of on-pack cooking instructions . In addition, where guidance is provided, this should feature prominently on the packaging. (Priority A) 8.26 In the case of meat which is not pre-packed, we recommend that the industry examines the feasibility of providing cooking guidance onall raw meat and poultry products, including those sold from servicecounters, butchers and other similar outlets. (Priority A) 85Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter8.27 We believe that the practice of washing raw meat and poultry is likely to lead to increased risk of spread of Campylobacter in the kitchen through splashes, droplets and aerosols, given the high levels whichmay be present on raw chicken. We recommend that this practice beactively discouraged by the FSA and industry. If necessary, consumersshould be advised only to wipe down a chicken with a disposable papertowel. (Priority A) 8.28 Whilst it is understood that the consumer does not always read such advice, we recommend, in the public interest, that all producersand retailers of foods, where enteric pathogens such as Campylobacter may be present, should provide advice on the key food safety steps which should be taken to prevent infection. This should, as a minimum,be applied to all raw poultry products, as the levels of the organism areknown to be high. Advice should include measures for effective cookingand for the avoidance of cross-contamination from the raw food toready-to-eat food (through separation of foods and utensils, andthrough hand washing). (Priority A) 8.29 We are aware of previous activity by the FSA to provide targeted advice to consumers regarding improved cooking/hygiene practiceswhen barbecuing and we recommend that this approach be repeatedprior to each summer period. (Priority A) 8.30 We recommend that the industry provides food safety/hygiene advice on the packaging of foods for barbecues, particularly raw meats,and especially poultry. (Priority A) 8.31 We recommend that attention is drawn to the potential risks associated with carriage of Campylobacter in domestic pets, and to the hygiene precautions applicable to them. (Priority A) 8.32 We recommend that further measures are taken to embed food hygiene and safety principles into the education of primary andsecondary school children . (Priority C) 8.33 In light of the fact that basic precautions may not be sufficient to prevent Campylobacter cross-contamination from highly contaminated foods such as raw chicken, we recommend that the FSA considers whatmeasures can be taken to highlight to caterers and consumers theheightened risks associated with certain foods such as raw poultry.(Priority A)Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 86Campylobacter detection and typing Introduction 9.1 Since the ACMSF last considered Campylobacter detection and typing, a number of developments has occurred. 9.2 In 1997, a national Campylobacter Reference Unit was established by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS), and the reference service waspiloted in Wales and the North West of England. 93A routine reference service was subsequently rolled out across England and Wales on a sentinel basis in2000. Through the Campylobacter Sentinel Surveillance Scheme (CSSS), standardised epidemiological and microbiological reference typing data havebeen captured for about 15% of all laboratory-confirmed Campylobacter infections in England and Wales.74 9.3 There are many typing methods available, and these have served to emphasise the complexity of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection in humans and food animals. A European Study to attempt to standardise andharmonise molecular sub-typing techniques for Campylobacter jejuni (CAMPYNET) has been undertaken (www.svs.dk/campynet). Despite numerous developments in typing methods, evidence to support their valuein informing the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection is hard to find. Thus there has been no clear success in developing interventions and theproportion of foodborne infections has not been established. 9.4 The publication of the Chief Medical Officer 's strategy for health protection in England signalled the dissolution of the PHLS and the creationof a Health Protection Agency (HPA). 269This, along with other developments in the National Health Service (NHS), has had implications for the futuredelivery of clinical and food, water and environmental laboratory services,including reference services. Campylobacter detection 9.5 Various methods for the isolation of thermophilic Campylobacter from clinical specimens are published, and the bacteria can be isolated fromhuman diarrhoeal faecal samples using any of the four microaerobic-atmosphere-generating systems available. 270What is not known is the extent to which protocols for screening clinical specimens are standardised acrossclinical laboratories in the United Kingdom, except for the former PHLS 87Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter Chapter 9laboratories, where standard operating procedures for the handling of food, water and clinical specimens were employed. The development of the HPAaffords the opportunity to standardise testing protocols across the NHS.There is also a need to determine the extent of technique bias with regard tothe strains and species of Campylobacter isolated. 9.6 Most clinical laboratories do not perform speciation. For example, in 2001, only 9.4% of Campylobacter reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) had been identified to the species level. This hasfallen from 17% at the time of our Interim Report. 1Results from the CSSS show that there might be important differences in the epidemiology of C. coli and C. jejuni , so speciation is valuable.74 9.7 Isolating Campylobacter from food specimens usually requires an enrichment step, although the choice of enrichment broth can significantlyaffect recovery of organisms. 271As with clinical specimens, it is also likely that the choice of enrichment media in particular will influence the populationstructure of strains isolated from food and environmental specimens. Thiswill occur because Campylobacter strains differ in sensitivity to the antibiotics in selective media272and are likely to grow at different rates. Given the continued debate about the importance of various food animal speciesas sources of human infection, it is important that there is as muchstandardisation as possible in the isolation methodologies used with foods,food animals and human cases. Campylobacter spp. do not always produce what are regarded as 'typical ' colonies on selective agars, and there are potential problems in recognising these pathogens. This may reduceisolation rates. In addition, the method of sampling the food can influencethe numbers of Campylobacter recovered.123This latter point has implications for microbiological risk assessment where enumeration oforganisms, as well as detecting their presence or absence, is important. 9.8 Success with molecular method development affords the opportunity to detect C. jejuni in food samples much more quickly than is possible using traditional methods,273,274bearing in mind that molecular methods may identify non-viable, as well as viable, organisms. 9.9 Finally, it appears that no single method will lead to isolation of all strains from clinical or non-clinical samples. It is, therefore, important that adecision is made at the outset of any investigation about the mostappropriate method to be used. The isolation of Campylobacter , particularly, from non-clinical samples, has suffered from the same developmental issuesthat have bedevilled typing. There are a lot of methods available but mosthave not been rigorously tested in multi-laboratory trials and there aremarked variations in efficacy. 275 As with any pathogen in a mixed population, the isolation of Campylobacter , requires a proper balance between suppressing competing flora while encouraging the growth of the targetAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 88pathogen. This can be particularly difficult with Campylobacter as it is easily damaged by exposure to the extra-intestinal environment. This will lead tosensitivity to selective agents, which may affect viability in selectivemedia. 276,277It would seem that the strategies adopted for Salmonella , where foods are inoculated in non-selective media, will not always be successful for Campylobacter because of over-growth by competing bacteria.278There is a need for a properly structured study of isolation media sensitivity andselectivity. Campylobacter typing 9.10 Scientific debate about the utility of typing methods for Campylobacter spp. continues unabated. There would seem to be general agreement that Campylobacter typing in the outbreak situation is an important tool for helping to unravel epidemiology. However, informationderived from the use of phenotypic and/or genotypic typing methods inoutbreaks gives two types of picture: outbreak cases linked epidemiologically, patients all infectedwith the same strain; and outbreak cases linked epidemiologically, but patients infectedwith different strains. 100 9.11 A typing method is any technique which can distinguish betweenepidemiologically unrelated strains. There is no assumption that differentlaboratories using the same method on the same strains would necessarilyget the same results. Many of the genotypic methods developed for Campylobacter are fingerprinting methods ie. they produce patterns. These can be compared with patterns from other strains for similarities. A typingmethod should provide a type designation or label to these patterns. Thishas been a major challenge for PulseNet in the United States where a keydevelopment has been the creation of a standardised nomenclature systemfor pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. 279 Typing methods are useful in investigating certain problems such as a localised outbreakinvestigations, but are not necessarily useful for larger epidemiologicalstudies. 280 9.12 A typing scheme is one used for discrimination between epidemiologically unrelated isolates belonging to the same microbialspecies. It should be capable of identifying strains accurately (typedesignations) and reproducibly at different times and in different laboratories. 9.13 Three main characteristics that need to be considered when evaluating a typing method/scheme are typeability, reproducibility anddiscriminatory power. Cost, ease of use, and turnaround time are alsoimportant considerations. 280 89Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter9.14 Typeability is the proportion of isolates that can be typed using the method in question. 9.15 Reproducibility includes three concepts: in vitro reproducibility (the proportion of strains which are typed with the same result on repeat examination); in vivo reproducibility (requiring repeat testing of multiple strains over time to assess the stability of the organism understudy, and hence its type); and reproducibility between centres (the extent to which identicalmethods used in different centres produce identical results). 280 9.16 Discriminatory power is defined as the probability that two strains,chosen at random from the population or unrelated strains, will bedistinguished by the typing method used. 280 9.17 Tables 9.1 and 9.2, at the end of this Chapter, describe the features ofthe main phenotypic and genotypic methods employed for typing using thesix parameters described in paragraph 9.13. 9.18 Probably the only widely accepted phenotypic typing scheme is serotyping using the Penner scheme. 281Indeed, this was considered the only practical method for surveillance on a broad scale.282,283Despite the effort that has gone into typing on a broad scale, typing studies to below specieslevel have yet to add significantly to our understanding of the epidemiologyof Campylobacter infections. Relatively high levels of non-typeability, especially when applied to poultry or environmental isolates,284coupled with reproducibility problems285has led researchers on a quest to find improved methods for Campylobacter typing. 9.19 Where typing methods have been used in targeted, hypothesis-driven studies, there has been greater achievement. Random amplification ofpolymorphic ( flatyping) have been used with success in tracing organisms across the food chain.130,179,286-290However, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which has also been used in this way, offers the advantagethat direct comparison between laboratories can be made much more easilythan with some of the other methods. 290-292 The scientific consensus that seems to be emerging is that MLST is probably the most promising of thegenotyping methods to date.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 909.20 Many typing methods have been developed using, and/or applied to, small and/or eccentric collections of strains. The national Campylobacter Reference Unit at Colindale has amassed a large, representative set of clinical isolates with accompanying standardised epidemiologicalsurveillance data collected through the CSSS. Analyses of the dataset arenot yet complete but, early on, the benefits of speciation and antimicrobialresistance testing were demonstrated. 74,293In judging the importance of C. colias a foodborne pathogen, it is worth reflecting that, in 2000, C. coli was estimated to account for over 25,000 cases of illness, and cost patients andthe NHS nearly \u00a34 million. 294Tackling even the smaller portion of Campylobacter infection in England and Wales is likely to have important public health benefits. 9.21 If the objective of typing is to unravel the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection, and hence inform control measures, using the CSSS strain collection affords the opportunity to determine the utility ofmethods like MLST in a public health setting where good epidemiologicaldata are also available. Lessons from typing studies 9.22 A summary of the features of the main methods for typing Campylobacter is given in Table 9.3, also at the end of this Chapter. There is not yet a universally accepted solution to the question of Campylobacter typing. First, no matter what method is employed, some well-defined clonal lines can be identified readily, although these are in the minority, and there isa wide range of variation within the remainder, which comprise the majority.Second, although there has been much work on method development, eachnew method spawns a series of slight adaptations, so-called \"creeping featurism \". This makes direct comparison between slightly different methods very difficult, and comparisons between laboratories even harder. Third,although there has been much activity in the research setting, there is lessevidence of the application of these methods in a public health servicesetting so that, despite the large investment in typing methods over recentyears, there have been few tangible epidemiological or public health benefits.However, where typing methods have been used in focused studies, e.g. forlocal outbreak investigation or for targeted studies across the food chain,there has been greater success. DNA microarrays 9.23 Although a wide variety of typing approaches has been developed for Campylobacter , the availability of whole genome sequence data offers the prospect of another potentially valuable approach. It is established that DNAmicroarrays based on the complete set of sequenced genes offer a uniqueopportunity to investigate and compare genome composition for individualisolates of a species. This approach has been applied to 91Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterCampylobacter295,296and its further development and validation may provide a more complete genome-based data set and a novel typing approach ofpractical value for the future. Conclusions Detection 9.24 It is likely that, for the foreseeable future, traditional culture techniques will be employed for the examination of clinical and non-clinical samples for Campylobacter spp. More rapid methods are now available but there is a need to ensure that they have sufficient sensitivity. Any method will sufferfrom inherent bias and this will continue to be a problem in studies onepidemiology and in comparison of different surveillance schemes. Theisolation of Campylobacter would seem to be more difficult than for Salmonella , for example, and there is a need for more rigour in method choice and for a properly structured, multi-laboratory study of the mostcommonly used methods. This is an area our Campylobacter Working Group will need to consider in reviewing research needs relating to Campylobacter (see Chapter 1). Typing 9.25 Speciation of Campylobacter has proved useful in differentiating epidemiologically between C. coli and C. jejuni . 9.26 Campylobacter typing should be driven by objectives and/or specific hypotheses. These might be: tracing sources and routes of transmission of human infection; identifying and monitoring, both temporally and geographically,strains with important phenotypic or genotypic characteristics; developing strategies to control organisms within the foodchain; monitoring trends in antimicrobial resistance; and outbreak identification. The method(s) chosen should then be dictated by specific objectives and/or hypotheses. In addition to this, appropriate sampling frames should be used. 9.27 T yping has confirmed the complexity of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection but, on a broad scale, has not yielded the expected public health benefits in terms of identifying a big target amenable to control.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 92Routine typing is probably not useful for source tracing and global epidemiology because of the carriage of multiple strains in animals, and theextreme diversity of those strains. 290Completing the analyses of the CSSS is, however, needed since the requirement for national strain-specificepidemiological studies might yet be demonstrated. 93 9.28 Where the objective is to make an assessment of Campylobacter across the food chain in relation to human infection, veterinary, food and clinical laboratories should use the same methods. One of the problems withcomparative epidemiology is that different techniques have been applied todifferent specimen types. It is important that, when carrying out research andsurveillance in animals, isolation and typing methods should take the leadfrom, and be consistent with, methodologies used for clinical isolates unlessthere are specific reasons not to do so. This recognises the fact that Campylobacter is primarily of public health significance. 9.29 The technological revolution in clinical medicine means that, in future, direct detection and typing using clinical samples will be possible.297An obvious benefit of this approach is the speed of diagnosis and the potentialfor real time epidemiology. DNA sequence-based methods like MLSTtherefore have the greatest potential to be \"future-proof \". 9.30 The variability and genetic instability of Campylobacter cautions us against believing that there exists some magical solution to the typing of allcampylobacters of human health significance. However, any improvement inthe tools available for differentiating the origins or food sources of Campylobacter spp. would greatly assist the Food Standards Agency in tackling human campylobacteriosis. Examination of the history of the manytyping methods summarised in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 prompted muchdiscussion within the Campylobacter Working Group as to whether the ACMSF could make a firm recommendation in this area. We have nowconcluded that the DNA sequence-based MLST method offers anopportunity in the short to medium-term to improve our knowledge of whatis a very complex epidemiological story. 9.31 The availability of whole genome sequence data offers the prospect of another potentially valuable approach to typing. DNA microarrays based onthe complete set of sequenced genes offer a unique opportunity toinvestigate and compare genome composition for individual isolates of aspecies. This approach has been applied to Campylobacter and its further development and validation may provide a novel typing approach of practicalvalue in the future. 93Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterRecommendation 9.32 As with all typing methods for food poisoning pathogens, different laboratories will take different approaches, and agreement will be difficult toreach. We therefore believe that the FSA needs urgently to take a firm initiative in bringing together laboratories capable of applying MLST sothat investigative programmes can be designed to improve ourepidemiological understanding in the next few years. We sorecommend . (Priority A) 9.33 We want to be very clear that this is in no way a recommendation that, at this stage, the FSA should be funding large research programmes ontyping methods. Rather, it is a recommendation that advantage is taken ofthe opportunity to get the most out of MLST in the shorter-term.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 9495Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterDiscriminatory Turnaround Method Typeability Reproducibility Power Cost Ease of use time Comments Typeability improves when serotyping and phage-typing areused in Repeatability on interpretationof lysis reactions so that astandard procedure for recordinglysis reactions is needed, and astandard taxonomy of types isneeded. 313,31424 hours 46% of isolates few markers among strains when used alone.Needs to be used in conjunctionwith another method. 281,282,30724-48hours 281,303Easy and availableto mostlaboratories.Low the lack ofcommercially available, high qualityantisera. 282It has been said that subculturing, storage and freezingmay affect stability ofphenotyping 306although typeability for poultryisolates 308,309although one author suggests that up to 40% ofpoultry isolates are untypeableusing the scheme described byFrost of the main phenotypic methods for typing CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 96Discriminatory Turnaround Method Typeability Reproducibility Power Cost Ease of use time Comments Automation enhances reproducibility and enables inter-laboratory comparisons. 284Within theworking of endonuclease is of critical importance323and the restrictionenzymes used makeinter-laboratory comparisonsdifficult. 306Low throughput,complicatedtechniqueExpensive Poor 323Good306100%;282 >89%319RibotypingThis is the method of choice for PulseNet in the US but applicationof a standard method is strictlyadhered to and enforced. 326 Conditions used in different studiesvary widely (especially restrictionenzymes and electrophoreticconditions), interpretation of resultsis difficult since genetic instability,even during in vitro culture, can lead to minor or major changes inprofile. 284,3273 to 5 daysgenerallyalthoughshorterprotocolshave small proportion of the genome.Procedures (especially primers andrestriction enzymes used) need comparisons (fla typing)Table 9.2: Summary of the features of the main genotypic methods for typing Campylobacter97Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterDiscriminatory Turnaround Method Typeability Reproducibility Power Cost Ease of use time Comments Not vulnerable to genetic instability.334Direct comparison whole genome is sampled and AFLP isnot dependent on other -based identification and typing methods,does not require prior knowledgeof the target DNA sequence.

The summary of recommendations whichfollows is thus listed as Priority A (where action is required in the short-termto assist the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in developing and implementingits Campylobacter strategy); or Priority B (where the Committee feels that work should start in the next year or so); or Priority C (where we consider thatwork can be put in hand as and when possible, and in the light of competingpriorities). Chapter 1: Background 10.3 Having published an Interim Report on Campylobacter in 1993, the ACMSF decided in 2000 to revisit the subject with a view to identifyingmeans of reducing the incidence of Campylobacter infection in humans. This decision reflected the fact that Campylobacter is the major cause of infectious intestinal disease in the UK and was taken against the backgroundof the FSA 's targets for reducing the incidence of foodborne disease and Campylobacter contamination of retail chicken. 10.4 As a first step, we held a workshop in February 2002 to take stock of research findings and to identify major knowledge gaps justifying on-goingresearch. The workshop also aimed to help us decide whether there werefood chain interventions which would reduce consumer exposure to Campylobacter and which would assist the FSA in its efforts to reduce the burden of foodborne disease. We were seized of the need to make ouradvice available to the FSA as soon as possible, given the fact that itsfoodborne disease target was time-bound. We therefore fed our advice intothe Agency in tranches as soon as it was ready. We also resisted taking anin-depth look at research opportunities and needs where there weresignificant knowledge gaps. 10.5 Despite the scientific advances made, Campylobacter remains a poorly characterised microorganism and this impacts on its epidemiologyand control. There is therefore a need for continued fundamental research,especially in the area of functional genomics. While the focus of this Reporthas been on the practical measures which will help the FSA develop itsstrategy for tackling Campylobacter in the shorter-term, the ACMSF 99Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterCampylobacter Working Group will meet again with the aim of identifying where research outputs, had they been available, would have contributed toprogressing the objectives identified as desirable in this Report more quickly.It should be recognised, however, that any research requirements identifiedthrough this planned review can only yield results in the medium to longer-term, given the time lag involved between identifying research and being ableto apply practical outputs. Chapter 2: The organism, human immune response, and pathogenesis 10.6 The debate about the role, indeed the very existence, of the VNC form of Campylobacter seems unlikely to be resolved in the short-term. It is a complex area and not one where we have been able to draw any firmconclusions. However, we are not aware of any evidence to suggest thatcurrent uncertainties give cause for concern in relation to food safety. We arenot, therefore, recommending that the FSA should commit funds to furtherresearch on the VNC issue. We note that the research community continuesto carry out work in this area. This should be monitored and we hope that aconsensus view will eventually emerge. 10.7 Campylobacter isolation methods have been improved since much of the work on VNC was performed, and it is now possible to recover cellspreviously thought to be non-culturable. What is not yet clear is whether veryhighly damaged cells of Campylobacter now recoverable from a variety of environments, and after a variety of treatments, pose an infection threat. 10.8 It is clear that infectious intestinal disease causes a considerable burden of ill health over and above the initial event. However, littleinformation is available on the incidence and economic cost of long term sequelae and it would be useful to have a more reliable measure. 10.9 We recommend that the Government should instigate a primary care-based sentinel surveillance system, aimed at measuring directlythe incidence and economic cost of long-term sequelae among cases of Campylobacter infectious intestinal disease. (Priority B) 10.10 We recommend that serological markers for recent infection and prior immunity be developed and tested through structured,epidemiologically robust, population-based studies. This should assistwith estimating the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in thepopulation (and hence estimating more accurately the magnitude of Campylobacter -associated sequelae ). (Priority C) Chapter 3: Campylobacter epidemiology 10.11 Campylobacter infection is a major public health problem. The epidemiology is complex. There are extensive animal and environmentalAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 100reservoirs and multiple risk factors for infection. Although epidemiological patterns, such as marked seasonality, are well described, their underlyingexplanations are still elusive despite much study. 10.12 Poultry appears to be an important source of infection. It is noteworthy that eating food, including poultry, on commercial catering premises hasbeen identified as a risk in several case-control studies. 10.13 In the case of poultry, some progress has been made in reducing the role of the food chain as a vehicle for Campylobacter infection. However, in addition to the contribution of poultry to human Campylobacter infection, many studies also point to numerous other sources and vehicles of Campylobacter infection. It is important that these are not overlooked. 10.14 The contribution of foodborne transmission (as opposed to other transmission modes) to the human toll of Campylobacter needs to be better defined and we note that the FSA has already funded a research projectdesigned so to do. We support this course of action. (Priority A) 10.15 We r ecommend that population studies to investigate the seasonality of Campylobacter infection be undertaken. An approach combining epidemiological, microbiological, environmental andveterinary expertise is likely to be needed. (Priority A) 10.16 We r ecommend that population studies to investigate cultural/behavioural risk factors for Campylobacter be undertaken. (Priority B) 10.17 We recommend that more extensive data are gathered on the levels of Campylobacter spp. in specific foods (eg. water, dairy products, vegetables, poultry and red meat) as well as in food-producing animals and companion animals. These are all potentialsources of exposure for humans. We recommend that consideration begiven to on-going surveillance as well as to \"snap-shots \" which tend to be the norm. It is very important that the microbiological methodsemployed allow meaningful comparisons to be made across the foodchain (see Chapter 9). (Priority A) Chapter 4: Measures to prevent Campylobacter contamination of chicken meat 10.18 It is becoming clear that control of Campylobacter on-farm is now a practical proposition, at least with birds that are housed. We brought thisview to the attention of the FSA in September 2002 to assist the Agency indeveloping its Campylobacter strategy. The first commitment must be to rigorous biosecurity, combined with high standards of stockmanship andattention to good flock health and stress control. This will involve such 101Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobactermeasures as restricting farm visits to essential personnel; ensuring visits are undertaken as hygienically as possible; and appropriate staff training onflock infection. The control of Campylobacter on-farm presents a greater challenge than that associated with the control of Salmonella . 10.19 Our Campylobacter Working Group received different views, both formally and anecdotally, about the possibility of the UK poultry industryadopting 'Scandinavian style ' systems of on-farm biosecurity. Where these systems have been trialed in the UK, they have been seen to be successful,although industry argues that long-term maintenance would be difficult.While Scandinavian and UK systems of production and control measures dodiffer in some respects, reflecting the different sizes of the industries and thevery different climates, we firmly believe that the application of biosecurity,such as changing footwear, and other hygiene measures, will either delay orprevent the entry of Campylobacter into broiler flocks and thus reduce the incidence of colonised birds. Studies in the Netherlands support this view.Changing of footwear was found to be important in a UK context, andanother UK study found that frequent replenishment of boot dip disinfectantwas one of a few factors which reduced broiler flock infection by over 50%.In the future, given current research effort, it may be possible to supplementbiosecurity with pre- or probiotic approaches, competitive exclusion, and/orvaccination. 10.20 In addition, it is clear that a well-run broiler farm can reduce the incidence of Campylobacter through adherence to a number of key principles. It should: be species mono-specific (ie. farm only chickens); supply the birds with water of potable quality; properly clean and disinfect houses after flock removal, whichshould include disinfection of the water supply system; protect the house from entry by wild birds and rodents; supply feed which has received treatment sufficient to haveeradicated Salmonella (and, hence Campylobacter ), and protect it from re-contamination; only carry out thinning if done in association with proper cratewashing (so that crates are not contaminated with Campylobacter spp. or other pathogenic microorganisms) and proper biosecurity measures covering eg. clothing andfootwear;Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 102ensure that transport crates and vehicles are cleaned and disinfected properly on every occasion; and maintain general biosecurity and hygiene barriers at a highlevel, to prevent infection from the farm environment. 10.21 We strongly believe that concerted effort is needed by industry to improve the microbiological safety of thinning. If this cannot be achieved,then the case for discontinuing the practice, and taking the necessarymeasures to protect the welfare of stock, becomes very strong. 10.22 In risk assessment terms, a lower incidence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks is also likely to be reflected in lower numbers of the organismin individual birds in the flock, and on finished carcasses. Reducing thenumber of Campylobacter -positive flocks can be expected to have a significant impact on the numbers of contaminated birds leaving theslaughterhouse and may also facilitate flock testing to enable positive birdsto be put through the slaughterhouse at the end of the day, immediatelybefore plant and machinery are shut down and cleansed. It might also offerthe option of directing positive flocks to heat treatment or freezing if thesewere found to be helpful in reducing Campylobacter loadings. An important factor in consumer exposure to Campylobacter in poultry meat is the frequency and level of contamination of the chicken brought into the homeor into catering kitchens. 10.23 We accept the advice we have received from various parts of the poultry industry that broiler chicken production is extremely pricecompetitive and that the industry is faced with continuing threats of importpenetration. 10.24 We do r ecognise that many of the measures for controlling Campylobacter in chicken imply additional production costs. However, there is increasing evidence that there are direct links between the general healthstatus of birds and their susceptibility to Campylobacter infection. In addition, the maintenance of good flock health conveys economic benefits.Measures put in place for the control of Campylobacter might also help reduce the risk of introducing other infections into the flock. 10.25 In order to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to tackle Campylobacter , good quality data are needed on the Campylobacter status both of flocks and retail product. Flock prevalence studies are an essentialfeature of any evaluation process, to establish a baseline and to monitorprogress under commercial conditions. We believe that Defra shouldorganise such studies. In addition, we assume that the FSA will continue touse routine surveillance of retail chicken for Campylobacter to assess the effectiveness of Campylobacter reduction programmes. The potential value 103Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterof industry data as an output measure should not be overlooked even if, for reasons of commercial sensitivity, such information cannot be madepublicly-available outside the Agency. We discuss the valuable contributiona standardised approach to typing can make to tracing sources and routesof transmission of human Campylobacter infection in Chapter 9. 10.26 We recognise that free range and organic chicken production is now a small but significant feature of the UK market. Given the importance of theenvironment as a source of Campylobacter , we think it likely that chickens reared extensively will come into more frequent contact with Campylobacter and that robust biosecurity arrangements aimed at reducing the exposure of birds to Campylobacter spp. will be more difficult to apply in extensive production systems. It is important that consumers are aware of this, notleast because one of the main reasons given for buying free range andorganic chicken is that they see it as a healthier product (see Annex E). Webelieve that information based on structured UK surveillance of Campylobacter infection in extensively-reared broiler flocks and the Campylobacter status of extensively-produced, including free range and organic, chicken meat would be valuable in informing consumer choice.Means also need to be identified of controlling Campylobacter in extensive production systems. 10.27 Our principal recommendation is that the Food Standards Agency utilises the conclusions we have drawn to intensify its work with thepoultry industry and other stakeholders to achieve wider acceptancethat Campylobacter control of housed birds is now possible. A primary aim should be to develop an industry-wide programme to spread the\"good farming \" practices and biosecurity measures which lie at the heart of the matter. (Priority A) 10.28 We recommend that the FSA, in collaboration with Defra, as appropriate, should explore with industry the options for modifyingthinning practices to reduce the threat to the biosecurity of broilerfarms. If the necessary improvements cannot be made, the FSA andDefra should explore with industry the conditions which would allow thepractice of thinning to be discontinued, notwithstanding the economicpressures to which industry has drawn attention. (Priority A) 10.29 If thinning is to continue, crate washing and other biosecurity measures (including clothing and footwear) need urgent improvement.We recommend that the FSA pursues this with stakeholders. (Priority A) 10.30 In or der to facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness of Campylobacter reduction measures, and to improve controls at slaughter, we recommend that Defra carries out surveillance of Campylobacter in broiler flocks. We also recommend that the FSAAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 104continues to perform routine surveillance of Campylobacter in retail chicken. (Priority A) 10.31 E xtensive chicken production is a minor but nevertheless important feature of the UK market. We believe that consumers wouldbenefit from knowing more about the Campylobacter status of this type of product. We therefore recommend surveillance: by Defra to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in extensively-reared flocks and the Campylobacter spp. involved; (Priority B) by the FSA to determine the Campylobacter status of free range, organic and other extensively-produced chickenmeat on retail sale in the UK. (Priority B) 10.32 We also recommend further research into how Campylobacter can be more effectively controlled in extensively-reared chickens. We note that the FSA is already considering funding research in this areaand welcome the fact that the Agency has invited Expressions ofInterest from researchers. (Priority B) Chapter 5: Measures to prevent Campylobacter contamination of chicken meat in Scandinavia 10.33 The ACMSF 's overall conclusions drawn from visits to Denmark and Norway by some of the members of its Campylobacter Working Group are that: nothing that the sub group saw in either Denmark or Norwayserved to undermine the Committee 's views on the feasibility of the on-farm control of Campylobacter in housed chickens; indeed, the Norwegian experience especially offered further encouragement that on-farm control in housed birds isachievable on a commercial scale; Denmark appears to have established a premium market for Campylobacter -free chicken; Norway has succeeded in getting the contamination rate for fresh chicken products in retail outlets down below 10%; the UK broiler industry still has some catching up to do but is,for the most part, on the right track; 105Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterhowever, the UK industry needs to be encouraged to maintain its best endeavours; opportunities for collaboration between researchers here andthose in Denmark and Norway were identified; some thought needs to be given to the efficacy and widerimplications of heat treating or freezing Campylobacter - positive carcasses; the potential for airborne transmission of Campylobacter on farms may need further investigation but could necessitatesome quite detailed research. 10.34 Sweden has succeeded in reducing overall Campylobacter infection in flocks to below 10%. It is encouraging that, within this figure, around half ofall broiler farms were able to keep Campylobacter out of flocks completely. The methods used to achieve these results (eg. robust biosecurity, dry litter)are not innovative and are readily applicable to the UK setting. Thisinformation about the situation in Sweden provides further support for theobservations made and the conclusions drawn by members of our Campylobacter Working Group following their visit to Denmark and Norway. Chapter 6: Campylobacter in poultry other than chicken 10.35 Such evidence as we have seen suggests that all commercial poultry species are as susceptible as chicken to Campylobacter colonisation. However, we note that there appears to be little hard information availableabout the UK situation, and most of the data quoted in this Report comefrom abroad. 10.36 We recommend that, in addition to the work it is doing on chicken meat, the FSA carries out surveillance to establish the Campylobacter status of other types of poultry meat on retail sale in the UK. (Priority A) Chapter 7: Measures to prevent Campylobacter contamination of meat other than chicken and other poultry meat 10.37 Campylobacter spp., including those which cause human disease, are likely to be widespread in the environment, and it is not surprising that foodproducing animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs are exposed to thisorganism. In terms of risk management, it seems sensible to assume that allflocks and herds will contain animals which are likely to be colonised with Campylobacter and to take steps during the slaughter process to minimise the likelihood that these are transferred to the final products leaving theplant. The control measures required to achieve this aim will be essentiallythe same for Campylobacter as for organisms such as Salmonella and VTEC.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 106We do not therefore consider that there is a need for Campylobacter -specific measures. 10.38 We recognise that both Government and industry have developed and put in place a number of measures to minimise the possibility of faecalmaterial being transferred from the gut (or indeed the hide and fleece) duringthe slaughter process. We believe that, if properly applied, these will providean effective barrier against Campylobacter contamination. 10.39 Cr oss-contamination is a particular concern in relation to Campylobacter . We believe that the proposed new EU meat inspection requirements, by reducing the use of palpation and incision, will help reducethe risk of cross-contamination. We agree that improving the flow ofinformation across the food chain is likely to assist traceability and facilitateapplication of disease control and food hygiene measures at the mosteffective points. 10.40 We believe that the quality of the information trail would be further enhanced if Campylobacter flock prevalence data were available at slaughter. We address this is Chapter 4. 10.41 In view of the variations in the data for the prevalence of Campylobacter in retail meat samples, and in order to obtain a clearer picture of the risk if any to public health from such products, we recommend that the Food Standards Agency should undertake UK wide, large-scale,structured surveillance of the prevalence of Campylobacter in red meat on retail sale . (Priority A) We note that the Agency has recently requested pilot work in this area. Chapter 8: Measures to prevent Campylobacter cross- contamination in domestic and catering environments 10.42 Raw poultry meat, particularly chicken, is, and will continue for the foreseeable future to be, a significant vehicle by which Campylobacter is introduced into the domestic and catering environments. Levels of Campylobacter contamination of >105cfu are seen on some chicken carcasses. The human infectious dose is reported to be as low as 500 cells.Given the likely difficulties involved in controlling high levels of contaminationin the kitchen, especially from sources such as raw poultry, we reiterate thecritical significance of reducing the levels and incidence of Campylobacter on such products to lessen the burden on domestic and catering premises in dealing with such hazards. 10.43 If Campylobacter can be effectively tackled at the primary production stage, then the anticipated reduction in the number of Campylobacter cells reaching the kitchen would enhance the effectiveness of normal hygienemeasures taken there. We make a number of recommendations below 107Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterdesigned to enhance the effectiveness of action in the domestic and catering environments. 10.44 We strongly recommend the proper use in catering of meat thermometers, as a means of ensuring the effective cooking of rawpoultry products in particular. The use of such devices in the home mayalso yield benefits and we recommend that the Food Standards Agency(FSA) considers communicating the benefits of the use of cookingthermometers for domestic and catering settings. We also recommendthat, as part of its review of HACCP implementation in the cateringsector, the FSA considers whether documentary evidence of effectivetemperature checks should be required to be kept. (Priority A) 10.45 We recommend that industry guidance is produced through trade associations, to ensure a consistent approach to the generation of on-pack cooking instructions. In addition, where guidance is provided, thisshould feature prominently on the packaging. (Priority A) 10.46 In the case of meat which is not pre-packed, we recommend that the industry examines the feasibility of providing cooking guidance onall raw meat and poultry products, including those sold from servicecounters, butchers and other similar outlets. (Priority A) 10.47 We believe that the practice of washing raw meat and poultry is likely to lead to increased risk of spread of Campylobacter in the kitchen through splashes, droplets and aerosols, given the high levels whichmay be present on raw chicken. We recommend that this practice beactively discouraged by the FSA and industry. (Priority A) 10.48 Whilst it is understood that the consumer does not always read such advice, we recommend, in the public interest, that all producersand retailers of foods, where enteric pathogens such as Campylobacter may be present, should provide advice on the key food safety steps which should be taken to prevent infection. This should, as a minimum,be applied to all raw poultry products, as the levels of the organism areknown to be high. Advice should include measures for effective cookingand for the avoidance of cross-contamination from the raw food toready-to-eat food (through separation of foods and utensils, andthrough hand washing). (Priority A) 10.49 We are aware of previous activity by the FSA to provide targeted advice to consumers regarding improved cooking/hygiene practiceswhen barbecuing and we recommend that this approach be repeatedprior to each summer period. (Priority A)Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 10810.50 We recommend that the industry provides food safety/hygiene advice on the packaging of foods for barbecues, particularly raw meats,and especially poultry. (Priority A) 10.51 We recommend that attention is drawn to the potential risks associated with carriage of Campylobacter in domestic pets, and to the appropriate hygiene measures that should be adopted. (Priority A) 10.52 We recommend that further measures are taken to embed food hygiene and safety principles into the education of primary andsecondary school children. (Priority C) 10.53 In light of the fact that basic precautions may not be sufficient to prevent Campylobacter cross-contamination from highly contaminated foods such as raw chicken, we recommend that the FSA considers whatmeasures can be taken to highlight to caterers and consumers theheightened risks associated with certain foods such as raw poultry.(Priority A) Chapter 9: Campylobacter detection and typing Detection 10.54 It is likely that, for the foreseeable future, traditional culture techniques will be employed for the examination of clinical and non-clinical samples for Campylobacter spp. More rapid methods are now available but there is a need to ensure that they have sufficient sensitivity. Any method will sufferfrom inherent bias and this will continue to be a problem in studies onepidemiology and in comparison of different surveillance schemes. Theisolation of Campylobacter would seem to be more difficult than for Salmonella , for example, and there is a need for more rigour in method choice and for a properly structured, multi-laboratory study of the mostcommonly used methods. This is an area our Campylobacter Working Group will need to consider in reviewing research needs relating to Campylobacter (see Chapter 1). 109Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterTyping 10.55 Speciation of Campylobacter has proved useful in differentiating between C. coli and C. jejuni . 10.56 Campylobacter typing should be driven by objectives and/or specific hypotheses. These might be: tracing sources and routes of transmission of human infection; identifying and monitoring, both temporally and geographically,strains with important phenotypic or genotypic characteristics; developing strategies to control organisms within the foodchain; monitoring trends in antimicrobial resistance; and outbreak identification The method(s) chosen should then be dictated by specific objectives and/or hypotheses. In addition to this, appropriate sampling frames should be used. 10.57 T yping has confirmed the complexity of the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection but, on a broad scale, has not yielded the expected public health benefits in terms of identifying a big target amenable to control.Routine typing is probably not useful for source tracing and globalepidemiology because of the carriage of multiple strains in animals, and theextreme diversity of those strains. Completing the analyses of the CSSS is,however, needed since the requirement for national strain-specificepidemiological studies might yet be demonstrated. 10.58 Where the objective is to make an assessment of Campylobacter across the food chain in relation to human infection, veterinary, food and clinical laboratories should use the same methods. One of the problems withcomparative epidemiology is that different techniques have been applied todifferent specimen types. It is important that, when carrying out research andsurveillance in animals, isolation and typing methods should take the leadfrom, and be consistent with, methodologies used for clinical isolates unlessthere are specific reasons not to do so. This recognises the fact that Campylobacter is primarily of public health significance. 10.59 The technological revolution in clinical medicine means that, in future, direct detection and typing using clinical samples will be possible. Anobvious benefit of this approach is the speed of diagnosis and the potentialfor real time epidemiology. DNA sequence-based methods like MLSTtherefore have the greatest potential to be \"future-proof \".Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 11010.60 The variability and genetic instability of Campylobacter cautions us against believing that there exists some magical solution to the typing of allcampylobacters of human health significance. However, any improvement inthe tools available for differentiating the origins or food sources of Campylobacter spp. would greatly assist the Food Standards Agency in tackling human campylobacteriosis. Examination of the history of the manytyping methods summarised in Tables 9.1 and 9.2 prompted muchdiscussion within the Campylobacter Working Group as to whether the ACMSF could make a firm recommendation in this area. We have nowconcluded that the DNA sequence-based MLST method offers anopportunity in the short to medium-term to improve our knowledge of whatis a very complex epidemiological story. 10.61 The availability of whole genome sequence data offers the prospect of another potentially valuable approach to typing. DNA microarrays based onthe complete set of sequenced genes offer a unique opportunity toinvestigate and compare genome composition for individual isolates of aspecies. This approach has been applied to Campylobacter and its further development and validation may provide a novel typing approach of practicalvalue in the future. 10.62 As with all typing methods for food poisoning pathogens, different laboratories will take different approaches, and agreement will be difficult toreach. We therefore believe that the Food Standards Agency needs to take a firm initiative in bringing together laboratories capable ofapplying MLST so that investigative programmes can be designed toimprove our epidemiological understanding in the next few years. We sorecommend. (Priority A) 10.63 We want to be very clear that this is in no way a recommendation that, at this stage, the FSA should be funding large research programmes ontyping methods. Rather, it is a recommendation that advantage is taken ofthe opportunity to get the most out of MLST in the shorter-term. 111Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 112ANNEX A: Membership of the Advisory Committee on the MicrobiologicalSafety of Food and the Campylobacter Working Group.

In connection with the efforts being made to tackle Campylobacter , especially in chickens, I thought it appropriate at this time to let you have theACMSF 's views on the situation in Scandinavia. 2. Three members of the Campylobacter Working Group (Tom Humphrey, Mac Johnston and Alec Kyriakides) made a short visit to Denmark andNorway in the week beginning 17 November 2002. We wanted the group toinvestigate whether the incidence of Campylobacter in commercially-reared chickens really was lower in these countries. We also asked the group to lookat how the Danes and Norwegians were tackling Campylobacter in chickens, and to see whether there were any lessons which could be applied in a UKcontext. Jonathan Back (who is the Campylobacter Working Group 's Scientific Secretary) also participated in the visit so is well placed to use theinformation gathered in developing the Agency 's Campylobacter strategy. 3. Because, in setting up the Campylobacter Working Group, we had co- opted Dr Eva Berndtson, a Campylobacter consultant to the Swedish Poultry Association, we had not planned a visit to Sweden, the other major player inScandinavia. Unfortunately, Dr Berndtson has recently had to resign from theWorking Group because of pressure of other work. We nevertheless hope 121that she will be able to provide us with useful material on the situation in Sweden and we are currently pursuing this with her. Denmark 4. There were 4,620 recorded cases of human Campylobacter infection in Denmark in 2001, although the true figure is believed to be much higher,and similar to the UK incidence. There is a much more pronounced summerpeak of infection than in the UK. The consumption of poultry meat is asignificant risk factor and the Danes have carried out a risk assessmentwhich shows that, where the number of campylobacters on chickencarcasses is reduced by freezing or other means, the risk of human infectionis also reduced. 5. All poultry flocks in Denmark are subject to surveillance to determine their Campylobacter status. Standard protocols are used throughout Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Control of Campylobacter in broiler flocks is closer to the current UK position (and less developed than in Norway). 6. The Danes are sceptical about the possibilities for on-farm control. Very hot Danish summers present particular difficulties. Some broiler housesare left open for welfare reasons, and this undermines biosecurity. Danishaction against Campylobacter is thus more focussed on intervention during or after processing. Campylobacter is thought to be particularly sensitive to freezing and work is in hand on the effects of freezing at -18\u00b0C for 10 days. The possible use of heat treatment at 75 \u00b0C for 15 seconds is also being investigated. 7. The group visited a typical, broiler farm. There are broiler farms in the UK of a comparable standard. There were 7 houses each containing 31,000birds. The farmer operated an all in/all out system. The farm was in goodorder and the buildings, though over 30 years old, were in good condition.There were 5-10 metres between houses and the site was coated withcoarse gravel which was routinely sprayed for weeds. Each house had a 40cm high, physical hygiene barrier. A wash hand basin was located away fromthe barrier and the house was not entered via an enclosed ante-room. 8. The group also visited a processing plant, similar to most in the UK. The company does, however, market Campylobacter -free chickens, sold at a premium. The requirement of Danish legislation is that \"the flock shall be controlled to give a 95% guarantee that less than 1% of birds are infectedwith Campylobacter .\" 300 samples per flock must be tested. The company has been involved in the development of a PCR method to provideinformation on Campylobacter status within 5 hours. 9. Overall, the group concluded that the current situation in the UK was close to that in Denmark. However, the Danes seemed to derive a realbenefit, in terms of the quality of data produced, from a closer integration ofAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 122the human and animal health surveillance systems. It was also apparent that the regular testing of poultry flocks yielded important information about Campylobacter prevalence and seasonality, as well as about geographical differences in colonisation rates. Norway 10. There has been a marked increase in the number of human cases of Campylobacter in Norway since 1997, the annual incidence being around 100 cases per 100,000 of the population. There is an approximate 50:50 splitbetween numbers of cases acquired in Norway and those acquired abroad.There is a marked peak in human infections, approximately 75% of casesoccurring in July-September. It is thought that many more cases are causedby water in Norway than in the UK. The consumption of poultry purchasedraw is among the principal risk factors although, unfortunately, authoritativedata on the level of chicken-associated human cases prior to theintroduction of broiler intervention arrangements (see paragraph 11) arenot available. 11. Given the rising incidence of human campylobacteriosis, and the association with poultry meat, Norway has introduced an Action Plan Against Campylobacter in Broilers. This provides for the surveillance of live animals, animals at slaughter, and poultry meat products. Ten composite faecalsamples are collected on farms 4-8 days prior to slaughter. If these samplesare Campylobacter -positive, the birds are slaughtered at the end of the day. Carcasses are either heat-treated, or frozen for 5 weeks. There is also followup action on Campylobacter -positive farms. This comprises standardised consultations and the introduction of measures to reduce flock infection,namely the disinfection of drinking water and the introduction of hygienebarriers. There is also a farm-based research programme to identify riskfactors for Campylobacter infection in flocks. 12. The Norwegian poultry industry is only about a tenth the size of the UK industry. Most birds are killed earlier than in the UK (at 32-33 days). In 1991,18% of broiler flocks (sampled on-farm) were Campylobacter -positive. This had fallen to 4% in 1998. The most recent surveillance (2001-2002) producedan on-farm incidence figure of 7.6%. As with human infection, there is amarked seasonality, with around 90% of positive flocks being identified in thesummer months. 13. The group visited a typical Norwegian broiler farm, comprising 1 house of 11,000 birds. Access to the house was via an ante-room which had threerooms, each with a door, coming off it. One room served as an office and hada window through which the flock could be observed. Access to the flockwas through a door on the other side of the ante-room in which a physicalhygiene barrier had been placed. There were dedicated overalls and 123Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterfootwear on the bird side of the barrier. The room also contained a wash hand basin which the farmer used before putting on protective clothing andfootwear. These simple interventions were sufficient to protect birds from Campylobacter in spring, autumn and winter and, to some extent, in summer. 14. The group also visited a poultry processing plant which was typical of most in Europe and employed no devices which were not already in use inthe UK. The plant was smaller, and tighter for space than in the UK. Waterusage was high. Unlike in the UK, birds were spray-chilled with cold water.Although Norway does not sell \" Campylobacter -free\" poultry at retail, the goal is to reduce the level of Campylobacter in broiler chickens at slaughter to as close to zero as possible. 15. The prevalence of Campylobacter contamination in fresh poultry products ranged between 4 and 10% over the period 1995-1998. Furtherfresh product surveys were carried out in 2001 (at production facilities) and2002 (in shops). Just over 1,000 samples were taken in each survey. Campylobacter prevalence was <10% in 2001 and around 2% in 2002. 16. The group felt that Norway provided some useful indications of what could be achieved by targeted on-farm intervention. Hygiene barriersseemed a cheap and effective counter-measure which the UK industryshould be pressed to adopt as a matter of urgency. The rather differentepidemiology of infection among broilers in Norway, compared with the UK,perhaps indicates a particular source of infection in the summer and thepossible involvement of contaminated air in its transmission. The potentialfor airborne transmission on farms may need further investigation. This couldrequire some quite detailed research. Overall conclusions from Denmark/Norway visits 17. Our overall conclusions drawn from the group 's visits are that: nothing the group saw in either Denmark or Norway served to undermine the advice I sent you on 26 September 2002 aboutthe feasibility of the on-farm control of Campylobacter in chickens; indeed, the Norwegian experience especially offered furtherencouragement that on-farm control is achievable on acommercial scale; Denmark appears to have established a premium market for Campylobacter -free chicken;Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 124Norway has succeeded in getting the contamination rate for fresh chicken products in retail outlets down below 10%; the UK broiler industry still has some catching up to do but is,for the most part, on the right track; however, the UK industry needs to be encouraged to maintainits best endeavours; opportunities for collaboration between researchers here andthose in Denmark and Norway were identified; we need to give some further thought to the efficacy and widerimplications of heat treating or freezing Campylobacter - positive carcasses. Sweden 18. As noted earlier, we are actively seeking information about the situation in Sweden which we can incorporate into our final Report, alongwith a more detailed summary of the Denmark/Norway visits, as part of aScandinavian overview. In the meantime, if what we obtain about Swedenprovides any new insights into how best to tackle Campylobacter , I will let you know. 19. I am copying this letter to Andrew Wadge and Judith Hilton. Yours sincerely DOUGLAS L GEORGALA 125Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 126ANNEX D: Assured Chicken Production Introduction D.1 Assured Chicken Production (ACP) is one of the organisations which gave evidence to the ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group. ACP sets nutrition and welfare standards for poultry and verifies compliance with thesestandards by producers who are members of the Scheme. ACP is alsocommitted to developing standards to achieve high levels of food safety andenvironmental care. ACP structure D.2 In its evidence to the Campylobacter Working Group, ACP explained that it is an independent company owning and developing the AssuredChicken Production Scheme standards for poultry. It is a company limited byguarantee. Membership of the company comprises the British RetailConsortium, the British Poultry Council, and the National Farmers ' Union of England and Wales. D.3 ACP is controlled by a Board of Directors responsible for the direction, overall management, and administration of the company. A TechnicalAdvisory Committee monitors and sets the standards for the Scheme. Acompany operates a certification system on behalf of ACP . This is linked toa Certificate of Approval and the approved scheme mark. The certificationsystem requires the examination of product, the production process, theproduction environment, and assessment of the quality managementsystem. D.4 The ACP Scheme covers some 90% of the poultry industry. Any site involved in chicken production is eligible to apply to join the ACP Scheme.Following assessment and acceptance, members ' performance is subject to on-going surveillance. ACP poultry standards335 D.5 ACP operates very detailed poultry standards applicable in respect of breeder replacement farms, breeder layer farms, and free range chickens forhuman consumption. The standards cover the farm site and emergency plan;health and hygiene; management and stockmanship; feed and water; theenvironment; for chicks and breeder layer flocks; records; anddepopulation. 127D.6 Similar standards apply in relation to hatcheries; and there are detailed provisions covering catching, transport and slaughter. D.7 Features of the standards include health and welfare programmes tailored to the needs of individual units; measures covering bird health; training to improve stockmanship; detailed rules on feed and water, the construction andmaintenance of buildings, and lighting, temperature,ventilation, air quality and litter. D.8 Standards stipulate the biosecurity measures which must be employed. ACP Scheme members are required to monitor for Salmonella but there are no measures specifically aimed at tackling the problem of Campylobacter . In its evidence to the Campylobacter Working Group, ACP identified areas where it thought Campylobacter could be most effectively addressed on-farm. These were the clothing, equipment and behaviour ofstockmen, the sanitation of crates and other equipment, improvedbiosecurity in poultry houses, and staff education in general. Other areasbeing closely monitored are vaccine development, competitive exclusion,the use of bacteriophage, and the breeding of genetically resistant birds.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 128ANNEX E: The UK market for extensively-reared poultry Production and marketing E.1 Although a growing sector, extensively-reared (ie. organic or free range) chicken comprises a relatively small element of the overall chickenmeat market. Approximately 1.2 million tonnes (carcass weight equivalent) ofchicken meat is currently produced annually in the UK. Of this, approximately4% (c. 50,000 tonnes) is produced extensively. 336 E.2 However, there has been a steady increase in sales of organic meat(including poultry meat) in the UK in recent years (see Table E.1). Table E.1: Sales of organic meat (including poultry meat) by value, 1996-2001 Source: Mintel337 E.3 Organic poultry meat is estimated to have accounted for 0.54% of the British poultry meat market in 2001, a figure predicted to rise to over 1% by2008 (see Table E.2).

France is identifiedas the major source of these imports, although it is noted that a significantexpansion in UK production resulted in a fall in imports in 2002 (when theyaccounted for only 14% of supplies). E.5 The shares of the principal UK producers of organic poultry meat to the domestic market are shown in Table E.3. Table E.3: The British market for organic poultry: market shares of major suppliers: 2001 Source: Organic Monitor338 Consumer perceptions and demand E.6 Research suggests that consumers are drawn to organic foods for a variety of reasons. A Consumers ' Association survey in 2001339found that 30% of respondents always, usually or sometimes bought organic. Thirtytwo per cent of these said the reason was because 'it's healthier/better for you generally '. Twelve per cent bought organic for 'better standards of animal welfare. ' The most popular reason given was, however, 'taste ' (34%). The results are shown in Table E.4. E.7 Data from the annual TGI survey looking at food safety in 2001, and drawn from a nationally-representative sample of 25,000 adults, found that32.8% agreed with the statement 'I buy free-range products wherever I can '. This was down slightly on the 2000 figure of 34.9%. This survey also foundthat 20% of those surveyed felt that it was worth paying more for organicfoods. This rose to 25% in the 25-44 age group, and 29% for socio-economic group ABs. Therefore, while this is still a limited sector, manyconsumers are now choosing organic and free range poultry products.

The term 'organic ', when applied to agricultural products and foodstuffs, is controlled by the OrganicProducts Regulations 2001 which implement the requirements of EC CouncilRegulation 2092/91. Standards for organic livestock production came intoeffect from August 2000, following an amendment to the legislation. E.9 Disease prevention in organic livestock is based on the following principles: the selection of appropriate breeds; the application of animal husbandry practices appropriate tothe requirements of each species, encouraging strongresistance to disease and the prevention of infections; the use of high quality feed, together with regular exercise andaccess to pasturage, having the effect of encouraging thenatural immunological defence of the animal; ensuring an appropriate density of livestock, thus avoidingover-stocking and any resultant animal health problems;Prefer the taste 34% Less use of pesticides 32% It's healthier/better for you generally 32% It's a more natural process 24% Less use of drugs in animals 17% It's better for the environment 14% Concern about GM 14% It has more vitamins and minerals 12% Better standards of animal welfare 12% Prefer the texture/appearance 7% My family/friends prefer it 5% Lower risk of BSE 4% Lower risk of food poisoning 3% Don't know 8% 131Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacterprohibition on the use of substances to promote growth or production (including antibiotics, coccidiostats and otherartificial aids for growth promotion purposes); prohibition on the use of chemically-synthesised allopathicveterinary medicinal products or antibiotics for preventivetreatments; a an 81 day minimum age for slaughter of poultry (except in thecase of slow growing breeds); specific provisions for transport aimed at minimising stress.For example, during transit each bird should have sufficientspace to rest and stand up without restriction, and birdsshould be protected from undue fluctuations in temperature,humidity or air pressure, and sheltered from extremes ofweather; full inspection of the production unit at least once a year, andthe possibility of unannounced inspection visits by theinspection body. Free range standards E.10 While organic poultry must be free-range,bpoultry labelled as 'free range ' will not necessarily be organic. The criteria for stocking densities also differ between the two categories - with stricter criteria for organic production. The term 'free-range ' is defined within EC Council Regulations 1906/90 and 1538/91 which lay down certain marketing standards for poultrymeat. E.11 'Free range ' may only be used where the stocking rate in the house is 13 birds (not more than 27.5 kg liveweight) per square metre and where thebirds are slaughtered at 56 days or later. In addition, the birds must havecontinuous daytime access to open-air runs comprising an area mainlycovered by vegetation of not less than 1m 2per chicken. The feed formula used in the fattening stage must contain at least 70% of cereals. The poultryhouse must be provided with pop holes of a combined length of at leastequal to 4m per 100m 2surface of the house.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 132athe prohibition on preventative treatment does not mean that veterinary medicines cannot be used (albeit with increased withdrawal periods) if the health of the stock warrants it. This couldinclude action where there were indications of Campylobacter infection. bIn practice, standards for organic poultry are slightly less onerous than for birds officially designated as 'free range '. Free range birds must have continuous day time access to the open air. Organic birds on the other hand must have access to an open air run wheneverweather conditions permit and, where possible, must have access for at least one-third oftheir lives.Campylobacter control measures E.12 As noted in Chapter 4, we think that extensively-reared chickens are likely to come into more frequent contact with Campylobacter which is ubiquitous in the environment. We also believe that it will be very difficult tomaintain high levels of biosecurity in the extensive production setting. Giventhe fact that an important reason why consumers buy organic is becausethey consider organic produce to be healthier and better for you, 339it is important that consumers are aware of this risk. This question is addressedin Chapter 4. Given consumer interest in this sector - for a variety of reasons, including animal welfare - it is also important that more research is undertaken into both the prevalence of Campylobacter in extensively-reared birds and how this could be more effectively controlled. 133Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 134ANNEX F: Implementation of Recommendations The Agency is funding several research projects including a casecontrol study of risk factors for Campylobacter infectious intestinal disease in England and Wales, andwork on the burden ofenvironmental and waterbornesources of Campylobacter , and will take stock when this programme ofresearch completed.(3.30) The contribution of foodborne transmission (as opposed to othertransmission modes) to the human tollof Campylobacter needs to be better defined and we note that the FSA hasalready funded a research projectdesigned so to do. We support thiscourse of action. (Priority A)Possible FSA research requirement in 2005-06. The FSA is already funding work using serological markers to lookfor evidence of VTEC O157infection using non-invasivesamples (e.g. saliva). Further workis needed to develop robustmarkers for Campylobacter before such tools can be applied inpopulation-based studies to identifypatterns and trends.(2.38) We recommend that serological markers for recent infection and priorimmunity be developed and testedthrough structured, epidemiologicallyrobust, population-based studies. Thisshould assist with estimating theprevalence asymptomatic the population (and henceestimating more - associated sequelae ). (Priority C)Possible FSA research requirement in 2005-06. The Agency is currently considering funding for a second InfectiousIntestinal Disease (IID) study toprovide updated information on theburden of illness includingcampylobacteriosis but this will notinclude the long-term sequelae . Due consideration will be given to thisrecommendation and mechanismsof funding once the proposedsecond IID study has beenprogressed.(2.37) We recommend that the Government should instigate aprimary care-based sentinelsurveillance system, aimed atmeasuring directly the incidence andeconomic cost of long-term sequelae among cases of Campylobacter infectious intestinal disease. (Priority B)Response Recommendation 135To await outcome of study on cross-contamination in 2004-05. The Agency will be funding a review of studies on cross-contaminationin the home and this may assist inidentifying specific gaps wherepopulation studies could beundertaken. Some information is also likely to arise from the Campylobacter epidemiology studies being put in place. In addition to the LACORS/HPA/FSA sentinel surveillance ofpoultry meat, LAs will be gatheringinformation on sporadic cases ofcampylobacteriosis andsalmonellosis to enable the HPA toidentify outbreaks and commonfactors linked to infections.(3.32) We recommend that population studies to investigatecultural/behavioural risk factors for Campylobacter be undertaken. (Priority B)The Agency is planning a meeting of key groups to be held in 2005 tolook at the feasibility of linkingstudies on Campylobacter in human illness, animals, and theenvironment to the rollingsurveillance of food. Current surveillance of retail chicken in Wales is already providinginformation on seasonality ofcontamination and more extensivesentinel surveillance is to be initiatedby LACORS/HPA/FSA in November2004. This study will also include aLocal Authority administered follow-up questionnaire for laboratoryconfirmed sporadic cases ofcampylobacteriosis andsalmonellosis to enable the HPA toidentify outbreaks and common factors linked to infections. FSA are also funding work in NW England looking at the role ofenvironmental factors such aswater.(3.31) We recommend that population studies to investigate the seasonalityof Campylobacter infection be undertaken. An approach combiningepidemiological, microbiological,environmental and veterinaryexpertise is likely to be needed.(Priority A)Response RecommendationAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 136The Agency has commissioned research to provide detailed andpractical information on bestpractice, which will enablepublication of a code of bestpractice on thinning for the UKpoultry industry.(4.66) We recommend that the FSA, in collaboration with Defra, asappropriate, should explore withindustry the options for modifyingthinning practices to reduce the threatto the biosecurity of broiler farms. Ifthe necessary improvements cannotbe made, the FSA and Defra shouldexplore with industry the conditionswhich would allow the practice ofthinning to be discontinued,notwithstanding the economicpressures to which industry hasdrawn attention. (Priority A)The Agency launched the second stage of the biosecurity campaignin October 2004. Initial stage of biosecurity campaign to educate and train poultry farmersin best practice was launched on19 January 2004. Stage 2 of the campaign, launched on 4 October, involves face-to-facecommunication to farmers of thebasic biosecurity messages,why they are important, and theevidence that they are effective inreducing Campylobacter . The campaign messages will continueto be communicated at Growersmeetings over the autumn, withfollow-up seminars in spring 2005.(4.65) Our principal recommendation is that the Food Standards Agencyutilises the conclusions we havedrawn to intensify its work with thepoultry industry and otherstakeholders to achieve wideracceptance that Campylobacter control of housed birds is now possible. A primary aim should be todevelop an industry-wide programmeto spread the \"good farming \" practices and biosecurity measureswhich lie at the heart of the matter.(Priority A)Surveillance of chicken to continue for at least the next 3 yearsprobably on rolling basis. TheAgency will review this as a basisfor considering roll-out surveillanceto other types of food. A sentinelLA based sampling program hasbeen established by LACORS/HPA/FSA to provide data on Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination of raw chicken on an ongoingbasis. Sampling under this newinitiative is expected to start inNovember 2004. A Defra-fundedabattoir survey has been carriedout by the VLA. The Agency also tries to make sure Campylobacter is included in current and future HPA/LACORSsurveys, where appropriate.Collation of this survey data by theEpidemiology of FoodborneInfections Group (which reports tothe ACMSF) will help identificationof priorities for further work.(3.33) We recommend that more extensive data are gathered on thelevels of Campylobacter spp. in specific foods (e.g. water, dairyproducts, vegetables, poultry and redmeat) as well as in food-producinganimals and companion animals.These are all potential sources ofexposure for humans. We recommendthat consideration be given to on-going surveillance as well as to \"snap- shots \" which tend to be the norm. It is very important that the microbiologicalmethods employed allow meaningfulcomparisons to be made across thefood chain. (Priority A)Response Recommendation 137Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterThe Agency has been working with LACORS/HPA to develop a rollingsurvey approach for Campylobacter in raw chicken. The survey is expected to start towards the endof 2004 and will include chickens ofdifferent production types. Thenumber of extensively producedchicken samples will be smallreflecting market share althoughany differences in Campylobacter prevalence should be reflected in the longer term. However,differences between productiontypes (if any) are likely to bemasked by contamination arisingduring slaughter and processing. As per 4.68.(4.69) Extensive chicken production is a minor but nevertheless importantfeature of the UK market. We believethat consumers would benefit fromknowing more about the Campylobacter status of this type of product. We therefore recommendsurveillance: by Defra to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in extensively-reared flocks and the Campylobacter spp. involved; (Priority B) by the FSA to determine the Campylobacter status of free range, organic and other extensively-produced chicken meat on retailsale in the UK. (Priority B)Surveillance of chicken to continue for at least the next 3 years,probably on rolling basis. The Agency has been working with LACORS/HPA to develop a rollingsurvey approach to monitor theprevalence of Campylobacter in raw chicken The survey is expected tostart in November 2004. FSA are currently discussing options for funding Campylobacter flock surveillance as an add-on to flock surveillance for Salmonella carried out by Defra under the Zoonoses Directive.(4.68) In order to facilitate evaluation of the effectiveness of Campylobacter reduction measures, and to improve controls at slaughter, we recommendthat Defra carries out surveillance of Campylobacter in broiler flocks. We also recommend that the FSAcontinues to perform routinesurveillance of Campylobacter in retail chicken. (Priority A)As per 4.66. The Agency will work with stakeholders to identifyimprovements in other biosecuritymeasures and promote these in thenext stage of the biosecuritycampaign. Output from FSA project MO1023 will identify the best operatingregime for existing crate washingsystems, identify simpleimprovements which can be madeto the equipment now, and proposemeasures which can beincorporated in future designs. Bestpractice information developedwithin this project will becommunicated to the poultryprocessing industry during Autumn2004 as part of the Agency 's Campylobacter biosecurity campaign.(4.67) If thinning is to continue, crate washing and other biosecuritymeasures (including clothing andfootwear) need urgent improvement.We recommend that the FSA pursuesthis with stakeholders. (Priority A)Response RecommendationAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 138FSA will also take into account the findings from the ongoingsurveillance of meats by theHPA/LACORS before undertakingany national meat surveillance. TheAgency expects to commissionpilot work in 2005-6 to developmethodology for a meat survey.(7.25) In view of the variations in the data for the prevalence of Campylobacter in retail meat samples, and in order to obtain a clearer pictureof the risk if any to public health fromsuch products, we recommend thatthe Food Standards Agency shouldundertake UK wide, large-scale,structured surveillance of theprevalence of Campylobacter in red meat on retail sale. (Priority A) Wenote that the Agency has recentlyrequested pilot work in this area.Await outcome of HPA/LACORS survey for data on turkey and otherpoultry meats in 2004-5. TheAgency will consider this once theUK findings from the 2004 EC Co-ordinated sampling programme onpoultry meat (including turkey) areknown.(6.60) We recommend that, in addition to the work it is doing on chickenmeat, the FSA carries out surveillanceto establish the Campylobacter status of other types of poultry meat on retailsale in the UK. (Priority A)Research on the control of Campylobacter in extensively reared flocks will begin in November 2004. Research projects will consider the use of plant extracts, probioticbacteria, and dietary manipulationto control Campylobacter. Under the Government Partnership Awards scheme, the Agency willpart-fund a BBSRC projectinvestigating bacteriophage therapyas an option for controlling Campylobacter in poultry.(4.70) We also recommend further research into how Campylobacter can be more effectively controlled inextensively-reared chickens. We notethat the FSA is already consideringfunding research in this area andwelcome the fact that the Agency hasinvited Expressions of Interest fromresearchers. (Priority B)Defra is currently funding an epidemiological study with the aimof developing an effective farm tofork Quantitative Risk Assessmentmodel that identifies practicalcontrol measures for Campylobacter in broiler flocks, and part of the study will also considerprevalence in extensively rearedflocks as a potential source ofinfection.(4.69) (contininued)Response Recommendation 139Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterAs above (8.26) In the case of meat which is not pre-packed, we recommend that theindustry examines the feasibility ofproviding cooking guidance on all rawmeat and poultry products, includingthose sold from service counters,butchers and other similar outlets.(Priority A)Labelling rules already require instructions for use to be given if itwould be difficult to makeappropriate use of the food withoutthem, and that where suchinstructions are given, they shouldbe sufficiently detailed to enableappropriate preparation to be madeof the food. The ACMSF haspreviously advised on the provisionof appropriate cooking instructionsfor raw beef and poultry products,which are currently appended toour food labelling guidance. TheAgency will consider incorporatingthis and the new recommendations into best practice advice on labelling of meat and meat products, whichwould be developed in consultationwith industry. The ACMSF is currently revisiting its advice on the time/temperaturerequirements for safe cooking ofburgers and other minced meatproducts.(8.25) We recommend that industry guidance is produced through tradeassociations, to ensure a consistentapproach to the generation of on-pack cooking instructions. In addition,where guidance is provided, thisshould feature prominently on thepackaging. (Priority A)The Agency has, since 2002, published information on how touse probe thermometers andminimum cooking times for meat,as part of its Food HygieneCampaign initiatives targeted atcaterers and food business. The Agency is considering what documentation and record keepingis appropriate for cateringbusinesses of different types andsizes.(8.24) We strongly recommend the proper use in catering of meatthermometers, as a means of ensuringthe effective cooking of raw poultryproducts in particular. The use of suchdevices in the home may also yieldbenefits and we recommend that theFood Standards Agency (FSA)considers communicating the benefitsof the use of cooking thermometersfor domestic and catering settings.We also recommend that, as part ofits review of HACCP implementationin the catering sector, the FSAconsiders whether documentaryevidence of effective temperaturechecks should be required to be kept.(Priority A) Response RecommendationAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 140Prior to each summer period, the Agency will continue to issueadvice on summer eating andbarbecue cooking (supported bylong-lead media activity). The Summer Eating and barbecue campaign (including television andradio advertising, leaflet andwebsite publicity) was launched insummer 2002. During summer 2003and 2004, targeted advice relatingto summer eating and barbecuingwas repeated in leaflets and on theweb site. Advice and leaflets arealso promoted at publicity events.(8.29) We are aware of previous activity by the FSA to provide targetedadvice to consumers regardingimproved cooking/hygiene practiceswhen barbecuing and we recommendthat this approach be repeated priorto each summer period. (Priority A)FSA will take forward in parallel with the Food Hygiene Campaign.Campaign activities to date includeuse of TV advertising and webbased activity to promote goodhygiene practices and messages onsafe cooking and how to avoidcross contamination. FSA is aware that some retailers already provide food safety adviceon their products although there isa need for more consistency in theadvice that is given. A number of retailers added advice on hygiene in connection withbarbecuing to charcoal packagingin the summer of 2003, which hasbeen retained in 2004. The British Retail Consortium will be asked to bring thisrecommendation to the attention oftheir members.(8.28) Whilst it is understood that the consumer does not always read suchadvice, we recommend, in the publicinterest, that all producers andretailers of foods, where entericpathogens such as Campylobacter may be present, should provide advice on the key food safety stepswhich should be taken to preventinfection. This should, as a minimum,be applied to all raw poultry products,as the levels of the organism areknown to be high. Advice shouldinclude measures for effective cookingand for the avoidance of cross-contamination from the raw food toready-to-eat food (through separationof foods and utensils, and throughhand washing). (Priority A)The Agency highlighted the risks of cross contamination from chickenin its hygiene campaign forconsumers which includedinformation on meathandling/washing. Some retailers are considering including a note on poultry labellingabout not washing chickens.(8.27) We believe that the practice of washing raw meat and poultry is likelyto lead to increased risk of spread of Campylobacter in the kitchen through splashes, droplets and aerosols, giventhe high levels which may be presenton raw chicken. We recommend thatthis practice be actively discouragedby the FSA and industry. If necessary,consumers should be advised only towipe down a chicken with adisposable paper towel. (Priority A)Response Recommendation 141Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterThe Agency is working with the DfES and Devolved Administrations to raisethe profile of food hygiene in thenational curriculum. A number ofmeasures have been launchedincluding: A \"Cooking Bus \" in November 2003 with the aim of delivering healthyeating and food safety messages toschool children around the country. The Agency 's Bad Food Live video with full supporting teacher 's pack has been made available to allprimary and secondary schoolsacross England and Wales. The videois aimed at 10-14 year olds and aimsto highlight basic food hygienemessages and raise hygieneawareness. The Agency will be supporting the roll out of 'Mission Possible! ', which won the FoodLink National Food SafetyCommunications award in 2003. Thescheme is aimed at primary schoolchildren aged 8-10 and is expectedto reach 10,000 in this age categoryin 2005. The Agency 's website includes resources aimed at raising awarenessof food hygiene issues amongstchildren and the material is due to beupdated in 2004-05. Several of the 2004-05 Local Authority food hygiene grants includeinitiatives relevant to raising hygieneawareness amongst children. The Agency is funding research at Surrey University looking at the waysof getting hygiene messages intoschools. The Agency is also working with the Scout association to look atopportunities to raise food hygieneawareness amongst children anddeveloping hygiene competencies inthe DfES Getting to Grips with Grubscheme.(8.32) We recommend that further measures are taken to embed foodhygiene and safety principles into theeducation of primary and secondaryschool children. (Priority C)This will be considered where food safety advice is being developed orrevised.(8.31) We recommend that attention is drawn to the potential risks associated with carriage of Campylobacter in domestic pets, and to the hygieneprecautions applicable to them.(Priority A)See recommendations 8.25 and 8.26.(8.30) We recommend that the industry provides food safety/hygieneadvice on the packaging of foods forbarbecues, particularly raw meats,and especially poultry. (Priority A)Response RecommendationAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 142If the key laboratories decide to put MLST in place as a front line typingtool then there may be scope for aring trial/quality assurance exercise toassess performance. This is unlikelyto be needed until 2005-2006.(9.33) We want to be very clear that this is in no way a recommendation that, atthis stage, the FSA should be fundinglarge research programmes on typingmethods. Rather, it is arecommendation that advantage istaken of the opportunity to get the mostout of MLST in the shorter-term and setin place the technology to adoptuniversal sequence-based techniquesas they become available.The Agency will initiate a programme of work in 2005 to bring together thekey human, food and veterinarylaboratories to examine the scopeand resources required to undertakethis work on a routine basis. There is a new head of the HPA 's Campylobacter Reference Unit and it will be important to establish links toidentify the likely direction of futuretyping work. Preliminary discussionssuggest that HPA will be consideringimplementing MLST and possiblyother molecular-based typing tools. The Agency is already funding work where MLST and other molecularbased approaches are being appliedto gain a better understanding of Campylobacter epidemiology. We would also aim to explore the potential for using this approach incharacterising Campylobacter isolates from the ongoing surveillance of retail chicken. The Agency will explore the options for a longer-term archiving resourceso that isolates collected as part ofsurveys and research are available forfuture comparisons using the mostappropriate typing tools.(9.32) As with all typing methods for food poisoning pathogens, differentlaboratories will take differentapproaches, and agreement will bedifficult to reach. We therefore believethat the Food Standards Agency needsto take a firm initiative in bringingtogether laboratories capable ofapplying MLST so that investigativeprogrammes can be designed toimprove our epidemiologicalunderstanding in the next few years.We so recommend. (Priority A)FSA launched a high profile TV campaign in 2004 aimed atconsumers to promote good hygienepractices and messages on how toavoid cross contamination from foodssuch as chicken. The FSA supportedthe FDF 's FoodLink Food Safety week which also featured crosscontamination.(8.33) In light of the fact that basic precautions may not be sufficient toprevent Campylobacter cross- contamination from highly contaminatedfoods such as raw chicken, werecommend that the FSA considerswhat measures can be taken tohighlight to caterers and consumers theheightened risks associated with certainfoods such as raw poultry.

The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) recently submitted a draft of its Second Report on Campylobacter ('our Report ') to the Chairman of the Food Standards Agency, prior to consulting publicly on the draft. 2. In the draft, we explained that, in order for our Report to be as useful as possible to the FSA in developing its Campylobacter reduction strategy, we had focused on short to medium-term practical options for tackling Campylobacter . We had not addressed those research opportunities and gaps falling into a longer time frame. However, we signalled the ACMSF Campylobacter Working Group 's intention to meet again with the aim of identifying where research outputs, had they been available, would havecontributed to progressing more quickly the objectives identified as desirablein our Report. 3. The Campylobacter Working Group met on 23 January 2004 to take matters forward. A summary of research1opportunities identified by the Working Group is given in the following paragraphs. Research opportunities Human immunity 4. There are still large gaps in our knowledge of human immunity to Campylobacter infection, and this lack of information hampers risk assessment and epidemiological studies. As we note in our Report, infectedpeople mount a strong immune response to Campylobacter . Vaccination may therefore offer a possible control option. We also note that immunityagainst Campylobacter is possible in the absence of acute infection, many abattoir workers apparently being immune to infection after initial exposure.Given the continuing uncertainties surrounding human vulnerability andimmunity to Campylobacter infection, improving our understanding of the mechanisms of protective immunity continues to be an important researchobjective. We do not discount the possibility that acquired immunity may behaving a significant biasing effect on case-control studies.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 1821For the purposes of this exercise, the ACMSF has not defined 'research ' rigidly. The term 'research ' therefore also covers 'surveillance ', particularly where surveillance results can play an important role in epidemiological research.5. We propose that the Food Standards Agency (FSA), in collaboration with the Health Departments, should consider the possibility of undertakingfurther research to increase our knowledge and understanding of the humanimmune response to Campylobacter infection. We also take this opportunity to draw fresh attention to the recommendation in paragraph 2.38 of ourReport that serological markers for recent infection and prior immunityshould be developed and tested through structured epidemiologically-robust, population-based studies. We hope that this will assist in estimatingthe prevalence of asymptomatic infection in the population and, hence,estimating more accurately the magnitude of Campylobacter -associated sequelae . Immunity in chickens 6. We note in our Report that a number of suggestions have been made to explain why chickens do not usually become Campylobacter -positive until the third week of life. However, current data on immune responses bychickens to Campylobacter remain equivocal, and further investigation could prove useful. Research to improve understanding of lag phase immunitycould help inform the development of vaccination or other protectionstrategies. Responses to stress 7. We touch in Chapter 2 of our Report upon Campylobacter 's response to environmental stresses and the debate as to the extent to which theorganism is sensitive to these. We believe that further research in this areawould enhance our understanding of the persistence and survival of Campylobacter in the environment and in food. Consideration should be given to funding work which seeks to explain bacterial behaviours as well asobserving them. The complex micro-flora of the gastro-intestinal tractand its interaction with the host are important contexts that warrant moredetailed study. Seasonality 8. Campylobacter infection in humans and in food animals displays a noticeable pattern of seasonality. However, while seasonality patterns arewell described, their underlying cause is poorly understood. We believe thatfurther work is needed to improve understanding of both temporal andspatial variations in infection. One of the recommendations from our Reportis that population studies should be undertaken to investigate theseasonality of Campylobacter infection, and that an approach combining epidemiological, microbiological, environmental and veterinary expertise islikely to be needed. 183Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on CampylobacterFood vehicles 9. We strongly believe that there is an important association between poultry meat and human Campylobacter infection. At the same time, we recognise that, in addition to the contribution of poultry to human Campylobacter infection, many studies also point to numerous other sources and vehicles of infection. It is important that these are not overlooked and werecommend, in our Report, that more extensive data are gathered on thelevels of Campylobacter in water and specific foods (e.g. dairy products, vegetables, poultry and red meat), as well as in food producing animals andcompanion animals. We also recommend that consideration be given to on-going surveillance, as well as to the 'snap shot ' surveillance projects which tend to be the norm. Processing aids 10. We cover at some length in Chapter 4 of our Report the possible use of carcass treatments and other processing aids aimed at reducing Campylobacter on chicken carcasses. We believe that this is an area worth reviewing at regular intervals, to assess the effectiveness of such aids inreducing Campylobacter loadings. Of course, it is necessary to keep in mind any EU proscriptions on the use of processing aids, as well as consumerresistance to their use. We also wish to emphasise that the main focus forthe control of Campylobacter in chickens should be the farm, and robust biosecurity regimes. Carcass treatments should not be regarded as asubstitute for good hygiene practice. Poultry other than chickens 11. It seems that all other commercial poultry species are as susceptible as chicken to Campylobacter colonisation. However, as we note in our Report, there are few data about the Campylobacter status of poultry meat (other than chicken) on retail sale. We have therefore recommended FSAsurveillance to help clarify the picture. 12. We recognise that, compared with the market for chicken, consumption of other poultry is much lower (although turkey consumption issignificant, especially over Christmas). We nevertheless believe that flockprevalence surveillance would yield useful data about the Campylobacter status of the live birds and suggest that this is something Defra might contemplate undertaking, perhaps on a 5-year cycle.Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food: Second Report on Campylobacter 184Functional genomics 13. The impact of whole genomic sequencing on Campylobacter research was highlighted in our Second Report on Campylobacter . Continued post- genomic and functional genomic research will important in advancingunderstanding of disease-causing potential and pathogen survivalthroughout the food chain. In particular, a better definition of the geneticbasis of pathogenicity and virulence, as well as its variation between strains,would improve Campylobacter epidemiology. There is considerable potential to exploit DNA microarrays to define isolated strains on the basis of theircomplement of functional genes, and this should be further developed. Tackling the immediate problem 14. The research opportunities identified in our review exercise may only yield results in the medium to longer-term, given the time lag involvedbetween identifying research and surveillance opportunities, and being ableto apply practical outputs. 15. We therefore wish to stress that implementation of the practical measures covered in our Report should not be delayed until the resultsof this further research or surveillance are available.
