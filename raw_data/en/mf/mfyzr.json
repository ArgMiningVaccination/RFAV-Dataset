Crystal Healing Healer [Michelle Roques-O'Neil](https://roquesoneil.com/pages/our-story), who has worked with crystals for more than 20 years, explains that \"crystals are different combinations of minerals that help purify, balance and realign by working with our bioenergetic systems\". Judy Hall, in her work, [The Little Book of Crystals](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.waterstones.com%2Fbook%2Fthe-little-book-of-crystals%2Fjudy-hall%2F%2F9781856753616%3F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%2Fuk%2Fbeauty%2Ffitness-wellbeing%2Fa43244%2Fcrystal-healing-beginners-guide%2F&xcust=%5Butm_source%7C%5Butm_campaign%7C%5Butm_medium%7C%5Bgclid%7C%5Bmsclkid%7C%5Bfbclid%7C%5Brefdomain%7Cwww.harpersbazaar.com%5Bcontent_id%7C073feb56-54cc-41b4-8eaf-b889c0ee4f80%5Bcontent_product_id%7C8832e644-d4e7-4b7f-9ea1-83149125371c%5Bproduct_retailer_id%7C), writes that crystals are said to \"have a stable and unchanging energy pattern, each with a unique frequency and energy field, or resonance\" that gives them special properties. As a result, \"they act like tuning forks,\" helping bring \"harmony\" to the \"very unstable energy field of the human body\". Put simply, crystal healing involves using gemstones to bring balance to an individual's life and mind. Aroma Point Therapies Aroma Point Therapies, or APT, refers to a collection of works that combines the healing potency of essential oils with specific acupoints or body zones in order to catalyze profound shifts in the body, mind and spirit. It is a gentle, completely safe and yet exceptionally effective healing modality that engages the energetic potential hidden within essential oils; the vehicles of the plant spirits and particular plant Medicine. The practice itself involves placing key, properly diluted oils on specific acupoints, chakras or reflex zones on the body in order to activate energetic and physiological changes. These shifts are part of a cascade of events that unfold both in linear and non-linear realities, and they foster the establishment and \"remembering\" of dynamic equilibrium and authentic naturalness on all levels of being. In pairing key essential oils with specific points and energy centers we're able to access the profound power generated in mutual resonance. The Medicine of resonance is crucial in these times of extraordinary complexity in our dysfunctions and disease states. It is also essential in building and co-creating empowerment pathways within health care. I have been certified in APT by Tiffany Carole and am currently in a Master Healer Program with her to continue my knowledge in this practice.
