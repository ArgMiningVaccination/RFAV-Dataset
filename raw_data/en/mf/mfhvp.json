Acronyms 221-2231 CHAPTER -1 INTRODUCTION The standard operating procedures (SOP) are vital documents which are essential components of quality system in any organization. These are used to ensure consistency in performing an activity. Their use is mandatory by all the staff members ofthe district laboratories every time they perform an activity. The accreditation and licensingprocedures also demand compulsory use of SOP. Epidemiological surveillance of a disease is the continuing scrutiny of all aspects of the occurrence and spread of a disease that is pertinent to effective control. It is adynamic process involving the infectious agent, host, reservoirs, vectors and theenvironment as well as a complex mechanism concerned with the spread of infectionand the extent to which spread has occurred. Surveillance of any particular diseaseincludes systematic collection and evaluation of morbidity and mortality data, reports ofinvestigation of epidemics, laboratory investigations to find out the causative agent, useand untoward effects of biologicals, insecticides and other materials used in control,assessment of immunity status of population and other relevant data for action. Theintroduction of laboratory techniques in epidemiological services has revolutionised theconcept as well as scope of disease surveillance. Now a days, laboratory support isconsidered an intergral component of a sensitive system of surveillance. This manual will help laboratories to play an important role in disease surveillance.

District laboratories are located at the point of first major contact of patients with the health care services. In most of thedeveloping countries minimal laboratory services are available at primary health centeror community health center (upgraded primary health centers). These laboratories providesupport for preventive, curative and promotive service for the individual as well as thecommunity. The aim of this manual is to provide guidance on the minimum basicrequirement and role of district public health laboratories in disease surveillance, outbreakinvestigation and public health survey. The language used has been kept as simple aspossible. The manual describes examination procedures that can be carried out usingbasic microscopy and other simple apparatus. Such procedures include the following. \u00d8The examination of stool for intestinal parasites. \u00d8The examination of blood for malarial parasites. \u00d8The examination for of water. \u00d8Antimicrobial drug sensitivity testing. \u00d8Rapid serological tests for common infectious diseases. \u00d8Quality Assurance and biosafety in the laboratory. \u00d8Clinical biochemistry. \u00d8Laboratory diagnosis of zoonotic diseases. Each laboratory procedure has been comprehensively described along with the requirement of material / equipments. Reagent requirements for each procedure, suitabletables, figures and photographs have also been given along with each procedurewherever possible. The manual describes procedures including sample collection, transport, referral and testing, and underscores the need for biosafety networking and data analysis. Thedocument is prepared in line with setting basic minimum lab requirements as part of thenational integrated disease surveillance program. This networking of laboratory serviceswill be as per IDSP manual guidelines in India which includes linkages and integrationof surveillance data based on clinical features versus laboratory confirmation. Thenetworking is required for\u00d8Referral \u00d8Teaching/Training \u00d8Supportive monitoring \u00d8Weekly/Monthly surveillance bulletin \u00d8Flow of reports and data While, in the initial phase, this is the expected function from district-level public health laboratories. States and districts are encouraged to further improve the functioningof public health laboratories, taking into account progress made and resources available4at different levels. The instructions to perform a test or activity have been described in this manual. It is suggested that the same should be rewritten by users incorporating thematerial and methodology to be used by them. The format described in the model SOPshould be followed. Before use, SOP needs to be validated and periodically reviewed(usually after one year or whenever there is a change in methodology or material).5CHAPTER-2 OVERVIEW OF INTEGRATED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE PROJECT AND ROLE OF LABORATORY SERVICES IN SURVEILLANCE 2.1 Preamble Disease surveillance has long been recognized as an important tool for measuring the disease burden, studying morbidity and mortality trends and early detection ofoutbreaks for instituting effective control measures in a timely manner. Though, thehealth care infrastructure in our country has grown immensely over the years, diseasesurveillance system did not get the desired attention resulting in frequent outbreaks. Theoutbreaks of plague (1994), malaria (1995), and dengue hemorrhagic fever (1996) indifferent parts of the country further highlighted the weaknesses in the surveillancesystem and brought an urgency for its strengthening so that early warning signals ofoutbreaks are detected and appropriate preventive and control measures are appliedtimely to minimize the impact of the outbreak. Government of India launched National Surveillance Programme for Communicable Diseases (NSPCD) as a pilot project in 1997-98 with the overall goal of improving thehealth status of the people. The programme included capacity building at district, regionaland state levels by strengthening and utilizing existing manpower, laboratory and healthinfra-structural facilities. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD),Directorate General of Health Services, acted as the nodal agency for monitoring andcoordinating the programme at the central level. A review of the programme indicatedthat in the districts in which it has been made fully operational, there is a definiteimprovement in the capacity for early detection of outbreaks and for a structured responseon a time bound basis. Keeping in view the immense utility and necessity of the scheme,it has been felt necessary to expand the programme to the entire country in a phasedmanner. 2.2 Integrated Disease Surveillance Project The Government of India is initiating a decentralized, state based Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in the country in response to a long felt need expressed byvarious expert committees. The project is intended to be the backbone of public healthdelivery system in the country. It will be able to detect early warning signals of impendingoutbreaks and help initiate an effective response in a timely manner. It is also expectedto provide essential data to monitor progress of on going disease control programmesand help allocate health resources more optimally. Main objectives of the project are: nTo establish a decentralized state based system of surveillance for communicable and non-communicable diseases and their risk factors so that timely and effectivepublic health actions can be initiated in response to health challenges in the country6at the state and national levels. nTo improve the efficiency of the existing surveillance activities of disease control programs and facilitate sharing of relevant information with the healthadministration, community and other stakeholders so as to detect disease and riskfactor trends over time and evaluate control strategies. The Project would comprise of following four Components: 1. Integrating and decentralizing surveillance activities. 2. Strengthening Public Health Laboratories.3. Using information technology optimally.4. Enhancing human resource development. The project will cover limited number of conditions based on state perceptions including 13 core and up to 5 state priority conditions for which pubic health responseis available. The conditions selected initially include important communicable diseases,risk factors for non-communicable diseases, out door air pollution, drinking watercontamination and road traffic accidents. District, state & central surveillance units will be set up so that the project is able to respond in a timely manner to surveillance challenges in the country including emergingepidemics. It will ultimately integrate surveillance activities under various programmesand use existing infrastructure for its function. Besides, government sector, sentinel privatepractitioners, sentinel private hospitals and sentinel private laboratories will be inductedinto the project. This will particularly ensure better surveillance in the urban regions ofthe country. The project will facilitate active participation of medical colleges in thesurveillance activities. The project will ensure uniform high quality surveillance activities at all levels by: lLimiting number of diseases under surveillance to reduce workload at the periphery. lDeveloping standard case definitions and formats for reporting. lDeveloping user-friendly operational and training manuals. lProviding training to all essential personnel and lSetting a system of regular feed back on the quality of surveillance activity.Laboratory infrastructure will be strengthened particularly at the district level to enhance capacity for diagnosis and investigation of epidemics and confirmation ofdisease conditions. Support will also be provided to network district laboratory systemswith the state and regional reference laboratories in the country. The project will effectively use the current information technology for communication, data entry, analysis, reporting, feedback and actions. Computers will be provided tofacilitate integration and timeliness of surveillance. A national level surveillance networkwill be established up to the district level.7The project will be decentralized and the primary administrative responsibility will be at the district and state levels but will be coordinated by the centre. Administrativerestructuring will include setting up surveillance committees at district, state and thecentral level. 2.3 Diseases under surveillance The diseases to be included in the surveillance project are based on burden of diseases in the community, availability of public health response and specialconsiderations and international commitments. 2.3.1 Core Diseases(i) Regular Surveillance Vector Borne Diseases : Malaria/Denguefever / DHF/Filaria Water Borne Diseases : AcuteDiarrhoeal Disease (Cholera), Typhoid, Viral Hepatitis Respiratory Diseases : TuberculosisVaccine Preventable Diseases : Measles, DiphtheriaDiseases under eradication : PolioSexually transmitted diseases : SyphillisOther International commitments : for enteropathogens etc.Other Conditions Road traffic accidents (Linkup with police computers) (ii) Sentinel Surveillance Sexually transmitted diseases / : HIV/HBV, HCV Blood borneOther Conditions : Water Quality : Outdoor Air Quality (Large urban centers) (iii) Regular periodic surveys NCD Risk Factors : Anthropometry, Physical activity, Blood Pressure, Tobacco, Nutrition 2.3.2 Additional State Priorities In addition to the core diseases, which will be under surveillance for all the states, each state will identify up to five additional conditions for which surveillance will be initiated.82.4 Role of Laboratory Services under Integrated Disease Surveillance Project The project envisages improving the diagnostic facilities in public health laboratories up to primary health centres. Laboratory support is essential to proper functioning ofdisease surveillance and hence comprehensive support will be provided for surveillancerelated laboratory work. Currently, the laboratory support in many areas appears weakand the available system is not integrated well with the district and state surveillance units.There is a need to define the specific roles of the various laboratories at PHCs, district andstate levels and strengthen these systems. Areas that need special attention includetechnology and infrastructure for performing essential diagnostic tests at the district level,particularly microbiology cultures, bio-safety management and quality assurance. The laboratory network for IDSP will be established at various levels: tPeripheral laboratories and microscopic centers (L1 Labs) tDistrict public health laboratories (L2 Labs) tState laboratories (L3 Labs) tRegional and quality assurance laboratories (L4) tDisease based reference laboratories (L5) 2.4.1 Peripheral laboratories (L1) Peripheral laboratories will function so as to assist the laboratory diagnosis of: i. Malaria ii. Tuberculosis iii. Typhoid iv. Chlorination level of the drinking water source in the periphery v. Fecal contamination of water by rapid H2S test vi. Proper collection and transportation of samples to the higher level of labs. Existing peripheral laboratories at the PHC/CHC level are capable of handling microscopic examination of sputum and blood smears and are currently undertakingthis activity under TB and Malaria Control Programmes. Typhoid can be diagnosed atthe periphery using 'Typhi Dot' test, which can be performed easily and has establishedvalidity and reliability. Kits are available for detecting fecal contamination of water,which can be used at the periphery and these will be made available. Peripherallaboratories need minimal structural modification of the laboratory areas in the CHC toperform these functions well. Most of them are currently equipped with microscopes forperforming microscopy for TB and Malaria. In the urban regions, the microscopic centers for TB and Malaria programmes can continue to provide inputs on these diseases, but additional selected private laboratoriesand established and accredited laboratories will be brought into the network as sentinelinstitutions in the periphery.92.4.2 District Level Laboratories (L2) The District Level Laboratory will be the backbone of the laboratory network under IDSP. Currently, the district level laboratories are the weakest link in the programme.The district laboratories are expected to have a major role in disease surveillance andthe existing infrastructure and administrative structure will be improved to undertake thefollowing tasks: Conditions Tests Tuberculosis AFB smear examination Malaria Blood smear examination Typhoid Rapid serological diagnostic test and sample collection for blood culture Cholera Stool cultureWater Quality Chlorination tests and fecal contamination by rapid H2S test & MPN test Diphtheria Albert's stained smear examination Leptospirosis Rapid dot testDrug resistance In vitro drug sensitivity testing of non fastidious bacteria being cultured except Myc. tuberculosis Dengue Rapid strip test can be done. Viral Hepatitis Rapid test for HBsAg, HCV only. HIV Rapid test/ELISA examination, Diseases Blood sugar, Cholestrol, Lipid Profile, KFT, LFT * For Plague, Measles, JE, water born Hepatitis viruses and other viral diseases: based on clinical diagnosis only sample collection to be carried out by the districtlaboratories and refer the samples for analysis to designated referral laboratoriesfor the purpose. Most of the district laboratories are now attached to district hospitals and primarily perform the functions of a clinical laboratory. These laboratories will be staffed by aqualified person who can undertake microbiological cultures. At the district level, integration of equipment and trained staff under Tuberculosis and Malaria programmes is crucial for effective functioning of the district level laboratory,since trained laboratory technicians are already available under these programmes.102.5 Following is the current status and requirements of equipment at the District level What is needed What is available and Where Incremental Needs Binocular microscope with oil Binocular microscopes have been Nil immersion supplied by the TB and Malaria programme and also by NPSCD Test tube rack Available Nil Table top centrifuge Available in district PH laboratory Additional one needed Incubator Available at district PH laboratory Additional one needed Water bath Not available Needed Refrigerator Available at district PH laboratory Nil Autoclave Small one available Needed ELISA reader and Washer Available in some districts Optional depending on local conditions Hot air oven Available at District PH laboratory Nil Bio-safety hood Not available Needed Inoculating loops Not available Needed Pasteur pipettes Not available Needed Vortex mixer Not available Needed - 20oC Deep freezer Not available Needed Colorimeter Not available Needed pH meter Not available Needed Semi automated analyser Not available Needed Glass distillation plant Not available Needed Micro pipettes Not available Needed Pipetting devices Not available Needed Electronic balance Not available NeededNeedle destroyer (electric) Not available Needed 2.6 Following is the current status and requirements of some of the common reagents and supplies at the district level What is needed What is available and where Incremental needs Ziehl neelsen acid fast stain Available with district TB laboratory Nil Blood culture bottles with broth Not available Needed Rapid diagnostic test kit for Typhoid Not available Needed Dehydrated media Not available Needed HIV diagnostic kit ELISA Available with NACO Nil Diagnostic kit for water quality Not available Needed Screw capped bottles Not available Needed The laboratories of ESI HQ and regional railway hospitals and army command hospitals in some districts can take on the role of the district public health laboratory ifmemorandum of understanding can be arrived at, with the state surveillance unit for11that function. The district level laboratories will be included in the IDSP computer network, so that information on identified diseases can be promptly transferred to the districtsurveillance unit and to the peripheral reporting units, as soon as data becomesavailable. 2.7 Private laboratories Private laboratories will be brought under a licensing and accreditation system. Till accreditation is established, the identified/selected private laboratories will be includedas one of the sentinel reporting units, and go for IDSP certification in a phased mannerby a panel of experts to be formed. 2.8 State Level Laboratories (L3) Most states have well developed state level laboratories capable of performing the role of L3 laboratories. Labs in medical colleges will be part of this level. The state levellaboratories need not be in a single laboratory but can be a group of well-networkedlaboratories in the state, specific for diseases under consideration. The primary roles ofthe state level laboratories are to: 1. Carry out advanced laboratory tests as highlighted in Table 2.9 2. Provide quality assurance of district laboratories3. Impart training of laboratory personnel at the district levels4. Participate in the epidemic investigation in response to surveillance challenges5. Link up with state and district surveillance units so that information transfer is optimized. 6. Function as the primary laboratory for NCD risk factor surveillance.7. Referral of specimens.8. Supportive monitoring for supplies, training, six monthly visits to the districts. 2.9 Following Tests will be performed at the State Laboratories Conditions Test Confirmation Objective Tuberculosis AFB culture and sensitivity Perform in 1% of Identify magnitude of positive cultures from MDR TB district level Malaria Microscopy and rapid antigen Confirm 1% from For Q.C. detection tests. districts Typhoid Sensitivity testing in Confirm 1% of bacterial Pattern of AMR for S.typhi isolates isolates at district level S.typhi typing Cholera Cholera culture and typing 1% of Cholera isolates Identify pattern of Cholera toxin test from districts bacterial infection Water quality MPN method Confirm 0.5% from For Q.C. district levels NCD Blood sugar, HDL, LDL, Risk factor surveillance surveillance KFT, LFT for NCD12Conditions Test Confirmation Objective Polio Follow present procedures Confirm Polio as per programme Measles ELISA test for Measles IgM Confirm Measles antibodies Leptospirosis Rapid serological test for Confirm Leptospirae Leptospira and sendingsample to referral lab for MAT/culture Dengue IgM test for Dengue Confirm Dengue Hepatitis Serology for Hepatitis Confirm 1% of samples Quality control A, E, B, C by ELISA Kits. from district Hepatitis work Anthrax Microscopy/culture for Presumptive Anthrax presumptive Anthrax and sending sample to referral lab for confirmation. Plague Microscopy for presumptive Presumptive Plague plague and sending sample to the referral lab forconfirmation In each state, the state surveillance unit will select the laboratories to perform the above functions for IDSP. These laboratories will be chosen depending on the existingstrength and willingness to perform the surveillance activity and can be from both thegovernment and private sector. Most state level laboratories have the infrastructure and equipment which may need to be minimally supplemented to function effectively in the roles specified as statesurveillance laboratories. Consumables may need to be provided for some of the diseasesfor which additional load is expected. State level laboratories are expected to do AMRtesting on random samples of isolates from districts and this needs additional inputs. Most of the state level laboratories are already providing training for laboratory technicians at different levels. This may need to be tailored to suit the needs of the IDSP.Currently, the biggest lacuna in state level laboratories is their connectivity. Somelaboratories have got computers but there is no infrastructure for sharing the information.Development of a network is essential. Most laboratories will be provided additionaldedicated computers and software under IDSP. The success of the programme will dependon effective networking; Peripheral District State Regional Reference 2.10 Regional, Quality Assurance and Reference laboratories (L4, L5) IDSP will have one central and four regional reference laboratories catering to routine work and outbreak investigations. The Central laboratory at NICD will function13as the apex reference laboratory for IDSP. In addition, selected laboratories will be designated as IDSP regional reference centers in the four regions of India. Along withthe above designated reference laboratories, there are a number of laboratories ofhigh standard in the country and they could be incorporated into the IDSP as referencelaboratories for various specific disease conditions. These include: 1. National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Delhi and its branches. 2. National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkatta3. National number of ICMR laboratories in different parts of India, which could function as reference laboratories for IDSP apart from NICD. These could help in: nCharacterization of the strains e.g. sero-typing, phage typing, molecular fingerprinting nRepository of standard strains and reagents and their supply to constituentlaboratories nProduction of diagnostic anti-sera and supply to laboratories in the network nProduction of reagents for antibody detection and their supply to laboratories nResearch in production of rapid diagnostic reagents nStandardizing of methods and procedures and provide these to constituentlaboratories nQuality assurance of laboratories All the laboratories are requested to participate in quality assurance programme of IDSP.14CHAPTER -3 BIOSAFETY The need for Biosafety guidelines stems from the fact that there are extreme situations in laboratory facilities in our country ranging from rooms with fans, windows, air conditioners to the more sophisticated equipment like laminar air flow system. Internationalstandards are rigid and in the developing country like India, it is not always possiblethough not impossible to adhere to such rigid guidelines. Good laboratory technique is fundamental to laboratory safety. Important concepts to have lab safety are listed below. 3.1 Entry / access to laboratory area \u00f0Have a biohazard sign (Fig 3.1) displayed on the doors of the rooms where infectious agents are handled. \u00f0Entry to laboratory working area should be only for laboratory persons. \u00f0Doors to the laboratory should be kept closed. \u00f0No smoking, eating, or drinking is allowed in laboratory area. Fig 3.1 Biohazard sign. 3.2 Personal Protection oWhile working in the laboratory always wear lab coat. oHave all the personnel protective equipments ready & use them as per the procedures (Fig: 3.3) strictly for highly infectious diseases outbreaks. oWear gloves for all procedures that may involve direct or accidental contact with blood / infectious materials. oAfter use, gloves should be removed carefully without touching infected surface, disposed off in container containing disinfectant solution. Hands should bewashed with soap & water. oLaboratory personnel must wash their hands after handling infectious materials/ performing test procedures and before they leave the laboratory workingarea. See washing of hands procedure (Fig: 3.2) oLaboratory coat should not be worn outside the laboratory area i.e canteen, library, and toilet or staff common room. 15oEating, drinking, applying cosmetics and handling contact lens are strictly prohibited in the laboratories. oLaboratory coat used/unused should not be placed in the same cupboard with street clothes or food articles etc. oLab personnel should receive suitable vaccination e.g. Hepatitis B. 3.3 General procedural precautions \u00f0Mouth pipetting must be strictly avoided. \u00f0Materials / articles must not be held in the mouth. Do not lick / wet labels for sticking. \u00f0All technical procedures should be such that they minimize the formation of aerosols and droplets. In the district laboratories do not perform any procedurethat generates lots of aerosolization unless there is an access to biologicalsafety cabinet. \u00f0Do not use hypodermic needles and syringes for pipetting devices. \u00f0All spills, accident or exposure to infectious materials, must be reported to laboratory in charge and a record should be maintained. \u00f0Display written procedures for the clean up of all spills. 3.3.1 Procedure to clean up all spills \u00f0Pour 1 % freshly prepared Sodium hypochlorite solution over spills in sufficient quantity. \u00f0Cover the spills with paper towel or absorbent materials. \u00f0Leave for 10 min. \u00f0Clean it \u00f0Wipe up the whole spill with fresh absorbent material using gloved hands and discard it in a contaminated wastecontainer \u00f0Wipe the surface with soap and water. 3.4 Laboratory working areas \u00f0Keep the laboratory area neat, clean and free of materials that are not required. \u00f0Decontaminate the working surface after any spill and at the end of the working day using 1 % Sod. hypochlorite. \u00f0All contaminated materials, specimens, cultures, must be decontaminated in the laboratory premises before final disposal or cleaning for reuse. \u00f0If there are windows in laboratory area, they should have arthropod / mosquito & fly proof mesh.163.5 Bio safety Management \u00f0Have one person responsible for bio safety activities \u00e0 Biosafety officer. \u00f0Health checks up of laboratory staff at regular intervals. \u00f0Immunization against diseases which are feasible must be given regularly, especially Hepatitis B. \u00f0Bio safety officer should train lower staff regularly. 3.6 Laboratory Designs and Facilities3.6.1 Design \u00f0Enough space should be available \u00f0Smooth easily cleanable walls, ceiling and floors which should be impermeable to liquids and resistant to chemicals and disinfectants. \u00f0Ample illumination should be available for safe conduction of laboratory procedures. \u00f0Regular, continuous and dependable, quality water supply should be available which is important for laboratory techniques. \u00f0Wash basins with running water if possible should be provided in each laboratory room preferably near the exit door. \u00f0Suitably equipped first aid box should be available in the district laboratory. \u00f0Control programme for rodents and insects in the laboratory should be there. 3.7 Laboratory Equipment Ensure the adequate equipment be provided and that they are used properly. 3.7.1 Essential biosafety equipment are a) Pipetting aids \u00e0 to avoid mouth pipetting b) Screw capped tubes and bottles.c) Autoclaves to decontaminate infectious material wastes.d) Plastic disposable pasteur pipettes, when ever possible should be used.e) Equipments should be validated before being taken for use and then revalidation should be done at regular intervals. 3.8 Training Human error and poor techniques are important in non protection of laboratory workers. Thus training is important. Staff training should include safe methods adoptedfor commonly used laboratory procedures like :-17\u00f0Inhalation risks using loops, streaking agarplate, pipetting, smear preparation, opening culture stocks, centrifugation, etc. \u00f0Ingestion risks handling specimens, smears, cultures. \u00f0Inoculation risks accidental needle stick injuries. \u00f0Handling blood and other infectious agents. \u00f0Decontamination and disposal of infectious material.

Wash wrists. 18Fig: 3.3 - Protective barriers (All are not for routine testing but for handling highly infectious agents) Goggles N-95 Mask Gown (must for lab work) Triple layer Mask Gloves Shoe covers 3.9 WASTE MANAGEMENT 3.9.1 What is Waste?Any thing which has to be discarded is called waste. The laboratory organisms require appropriate handling. The most common documented transmission of infection fromwaste to health care worker is through contaminated metallic waste. Hospital waste is apotential reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms. Decontamination of waste and theirultimate disposal are closely interrelated. Laboratory wastes are of different category & 19can be classified as can be seen in Fig:-3.4 Fig;3.4 - Classification of Laboratory Waste / Hospital wastes. Hazardous Non Hazardous Infectious Chemical waste Sharps. Non Sharp. Patients contaminates Laboratory Specimen Lab waste Animal Parts/diseases (not in district lab.) Dressings Linens Disposable Clothings of patients. Catheters etc. 3.9.2 Hospital/Laboratory Waste Management 3.9.2.1 Material required 1) Waste disposal color coded bags with biohazard symbol. blue, red, black and yellow. 2) Trolley baskets for holding the bags.3) Autoclave for decontamination of waste on site.4) Disinfectant solution (Sodium hypochlorite solution.).5) Incinerator if possible (Optional).6) Soap for hand washing and towel for drying hands.7) Gloves.8) Puncture proof containers plastic / metal with a biohazard symbol.Administrative Paper waste &Kitchen wasteRecyclables (glass bottles etc.)203.9.2.2 Follow management at every step from the site of generation Segregation.Collection.Transportation.Storage.Treatment to disinfect.Final disposal. \u00f0Segregate waste into the prescribed categories at the point of generation. \u00f0Color coded bags as per international norms. (Table-3.1) 3.10 Methodology In the district lab, the lab waste handling is an essential job which needs to be under supervision of biosafety officer. Broad guidelines to be followed are : \u00f0Segregate the different category of waste at the point of generation. \u00f0Discard infectious wastes (non sharp) if possible in disinfectant solution or autoclave to render it non-infectious. \u00f0Discard sharp waste i.e. needles, blades etc in a puncture proof containers. After the container is 2/3 filled, it should be autoclaved/ shredded and landfilled for disposal. \u00f0If nothing is available for disposal deep bury (as per standard guidelines) in a secure area. 3.11 Categories All waste should be decontaminated (chemically/autoclaving) before final disposal/ reuse. a) Non contaminated waste which can be reused or recycled, disposed off as general house hold waste. b) Contaminated sharps disposed off in puncture proof containers fitted with cover, labeled as infectious. c) Contaminated reusable materials for decontamination by autoclave, thereafter washing and reuse/ recycle. d) Contaminated disposable material for autoclaving & disposal.e) Contaminated material for direct incineration. 213.12 Quality control \u00f0Check that proper quality bags are purchased. \u00f0Autoclave monitoring & maintenance. \u00f0Disinfectant quality check. 3.13 Contaminated infectious materials for autoclaving and reuse lNo pre cleaning to be done. lTransfer material to autoclave. lAutoclave at 121\u00b0C / 15 lbs pressure for 45 minutes. lIf cleaning is required, do washing as described (Section 5.4.2). lRe use. 3.14 Contaminated infectious waste for disposal lAutoclave in leak proof container. i.e. autoclavable colour coded plastic bags. lPlace material in a transfer containers / trolleys with bags. lTransport to incinerator. lIf reusable transfer containers are used they should be disinfected andcleaned before they are returned to laboratories. lDiscarding jars preferably unbreakable should be used and they shouldhave suitable disinfectant (Sodium hypochlorite 1%) freshly prepared eachday.

The clinical samples should be processedonly in designated laboratory having the proper containment facility. 4.2 BLOOD SPECIMEN COLLECTION Blood and separated serum are the most common specimens taken to investigate outbreaks of communicable diseases. Venous blood can be used for isolation andidentification of the pathogen in culture and by inoculation, or separated into serum forthe detection of genetic material (e.g. using the polymerase chain reaction), specificantibodies, antigens, or toxins (e.g. by ELISA). When specific antibodies are beingassayed, it is often helpful to collect paired sera, i.e. an acute sample at the onset ofillness and a convalescent sample one to four weeks later. Blood can also be collectedby finger prick for the preparation of slides for microscopy or for absorption ontospecial filter paper discs for analysis. Whenever possible, blood specimens for cultureshould be taken before antibiotics are administered to the patient 4.2.1 Venous blood sample 4.2.1.1 Materials required lSkin disinfectant : 70% alcohol (isopropyl alcohol, ethanol) or 10% povidone iodine, swabs, gauze pads, band aid lDisposable latex gloves lTourniquet and sterile disposable syringes and needles lSterile screw-cap tubes, blood culture bottles (50ml for adults, 25ml for children)with appropriate media where ever required. lLabels.244.2.1.2 Method of collection lPlace a tourniquet above the venepuncture site lPalpate and locate the vein. lDisinfect the venepuncture site meticulously with 10% povidone iodine or 70% isopropyl alcohol by swabbing the skin concentrically from the centre of thevenepuncture site outwards. Let the disinfectant evaporate. Do not repalpatethe vein again. Perform venepuncture and collect required quantity of blood. lRemove the tourniquet. If collection is done for blood culture, withdraw theneedle and then apply swab on skin. Apply pressure to site until bleedingstops, and apply band-aid (if desired). lUsing aseptic technique, transfer the specimen to sterile sample collection bottle.For blood culture bottles, swab the top with 70% alcohol, flame it and theninoculate the blood in the bottle through the hole in the cap. Secure capstightly. lBlood should not be squeezed through the needle. lLabel the tube, including the unique patient identification number, usingpermanent marker pen. lDo not recap used sharps. Discard directly into the sharps disposal containeror destroy using a needle destroyer as per the procedure. lComplete the case investigation and the laboratory request forms using thesame identification number. lDo not use wet tubes for collecting blood as it leads to heamolysis. 4.2.1.3 Handling of blood samples lKeep blood culture bottles and blood sample tubes upright and secured in a screw cap container or in a rack in a transport box at room temperature. lCushion or suspend bottles during transport over rough terrain to prevent lysisof red cells. Place enough absorbent paper around them to soak up all theliquid in case of a spill. lBlood sample bottle should be kept undisturbed at room temperature for 30 to45 minutes to prevent lysis. 4.2.1.4 Separation of serum from 4.2.1.4.1 Additional Pasteur pipettes and bulb, or disposable pasteur pipettes. The latter are easier to handle and can easily be disposed of in the field laboratory. lSterile screw-cap tubes - 2 per sample (preferably 5ml vials).254.2.1.4.2 Method of separation lAfter the blood specimen clots for 30-45 minutes at ambient temperature, keep it at 4 to 8\u00b0C for the clot to retract for a minimum of 1 to 2 hours. It canbe stored at this temperature for 48-72 hours till serum is separated. lRemove the clot aseptically using sterile Pasteur pipette and centrifuge thesupernatant at low speed (1500 rpm for 5-10 minutes) to remove residualblood cells. Clear portion/serum may be aliquoted. Ensure that the centrifugeis in good condition and the tubes are properly closed and balanced to avoidbreakage and spilling. lIn case a centrifuge machine is not available, and there is likely to be a delaybefore samples can be transported to a laboratory, allow 4-6 hours to elapseafter taking the blood sample to ensure adequate clot retraction. Using thepasteur pipette, remove the clear yellow serum whilst taking care to keep thetip as far as possible from the clot, and avoid agitating the blood tube duringthe removal process. Transfer to plastic screw cap tubes and secure caps tightly. lLabel the tubes with the same patient details that appear on the blood sampletube. 4.2.1.4.3 Handling and transportation. lSera may be stored at 4-8\u00b0C for up to 10 days. If the serum needs to be stored for weeks or months before processing or sending to other lab, then keepat -20\u00b0C or in freezer compartment of refrigerator. Do not freeze unseparated blood samples to avoid haemolysis. 4.2.2 Capillary blood sample ear Materials required. lDisposable sterile lancets , disinfectant (70 % alcohol), swabs lGlass slides, cover slips, slide box lFilter paper lFixatives such as methanol. 4.2.2.2 Method of collection lDisinfect finger or thumb for adults, thumb for children, or side of heel for infants by swabbing with 70% isopropyl alcohol, and prickwith a sterile lancet. Wipe away the first drop of blood. lDiscard used lancets directly into the sharps disposal container.26 lCollect blood directly onto labelled glass microscope slides and/or filter paper (Whatman No. 3 with circle of 18mm diameter). When collecting on a filterpaper, ensure that the premarked area is completely soaked with blood onboth the sides. 4.2.3 Method of preparation of blood films Blood films should be made by trained personnel. If this is not possible, they can be prepared from heparinized or EDTA blood specimens sent to the laboratory. 4.2.3.1 Thick films for microscopy lDisinfect and prick site with a lancet as described above. lTake one or more large drops of blood onto the centre of the slide making sure that the slide does not touch the skin. lSpread the blood in a circle about 1 cm in diameter using the corner ofanother glass slide. lAir-dry the film in a horizontal position. Do not dry the film by heating over aflame or other heat source.(SEE FIG: 4.1) lLabel the slide with patient identification number and name. Fig: 4.1 - MAKING OF THIN & THICK SMEARS Prick finger tip with disposable sterile lancet. Thicksmear: spread drop of blood Touch drop of blood onto center of slide in circle of slide Thinfilm: spread using another slide at angle of 45oLable the slide Collection of blood on filter paper (premarked) 274.2.3.2 Thin films for microscopy lTake another drop of blood to the glass slide about 2 cm from one end making sure that the slide does not touch the skin. lPlace the slide horizontally on a flat surface. lHold the side of a second clean glass slide (the spreader) on to the center ofthe specimen slide and move it back until it touches the drop and the bloodspreads along its base. lAt an angle of about 45\u00b0, move the spreader firmly and steadily across thespecimen slide and air-dry the film quickly. Do not dry over a flame or otherheat source. lLabel the slide with patient identification number and name. lFix the dried film by dipping the glass slide in methanol for a few seconds andair dry. 4.2.3.3. Handling and transportation lTransport air-dried and/or fixed films at ambient temperature preferably within 24 hours of specimen collection. Do not refrigerate. Thick and thin films shouldbe kept in separate slide boxes. 4.3 CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF) SPECIMEN COLLECTION The specimen must be taken by a physician experienced in the procedure. CSF is used in the diagnosis of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal meningitis. 4.3.1 Materials required Lumbar puncture tray materials: gloves, cotton, bore with stylet(sterilized). lSix externally threaded sterile screw-cap tubes and tube rack 4.3.2 Method of collection Only experienced clinician should be involved in the collection of CSF samples. CSF is collected directly into the separate screw-cap sterile tubes. Separate tubes shouldbe collected for bacterial and viral processing. lMake the patient lie on the bed in left lateral position. Ask the patient to flexthe neck (so that the chin touches the chest) hip and the knee joint.28lUsing the iliac crest as the reference point, palpate the joint space between the 4th and the 5th lumbar vertebrae and identify the surface anatomy. lDisinfect the site meticulously with 10% povidone iodine or 70% isopropylalcohol by swabbing the skin concentrically from the centre of the site outwards.Let the disinfectant evaporate. Do not repalpate the site again. lInfiltrate the local area with the local anaestheic and wait for 4-5 minutes forthe effect to appear before performing lumbar puncture lInsert the sterile lumbar puncture needle between the 4th and 5th lumbarvertebrae to a depth of 4-5 cm, withdraw the stylet. Fluid flows freely throughthe needle. lBetween 1 and 2 ml of CSF is collected in each of the 3 tubes, one for culture,one for biochemical analysis and one for cytology. Note: - Haemorrhagic CSF sample is not recommended for serological testing.4.3.3 Handling and transportation lIn general, send the specimens to the laboratory and process as soon as possible. lTransport CSF specimens for bacteriology at ambient temperature, generallywithout transport media. Never refrigerate the CSF , as many of the bacterialpathogens do not survive well at low temperatures. lCSF specimens for virology do not need transport medium. They should betransported at 4-8\u00b0C. 4.4 STOOL SAMPLE COLLECTION Stool specimens are most useful for microbiological diagnosis if collected soon after onset of diarrhoea (for most viruses < 48 hours and for bacteria < 4 days after theonset of illness), and preferably before the initiation of antibiotic therapy. If required,two or three specimens may be collected on consecutive / alternate days. Stool is thepreferred specimen for culture of bacterial, viral, and parasitic diarrhoeal pathogens.Rectal swab samples may also be used in case of infants, debilitated patients or whilecarrying out direct endoscopic visualization of a lesion or any other situation wherevoided stool sample collection is not feasible. In general, rectal swabs are not recommended for the isolation of viruses. As far as possible, do not collect stoolsamples from a bedpan. 4.4.1 Materials required lClean, dry, leak-proof screw cap container (which has not been priorly washed with a disinfectant) and tape lAppropriate bacterial transport media for transport of rectal swabs from infants294.4.2 Method of collecting a stool specimen/ rectal swab-: Please refer to chapter 9 4.4.3 Handling and transportation. Please refer to chapter 9 lStool specimens should be transported at 4-8\u00b0C. Bacterial / viral culture isolation rate fall significantly if specimens are not processed within 1-2 daysof collection. lSpecimens to be examined for parasites should be mixed with 10% formalinas preservative (3 parts stool to 1 part preservative). Do not add formaline ifthere is blood and mucus in stool. Transport at ambient temperature incontainers sealed in plastic bags. 4.5 RESPIRATORY TRACT SPECIMEN COLLECTION Specimens are collected from the upper or lower respiratory tract, depending on the site of infection. Upper respiratory tract pathogens (viral and bacterial) are found inthroat and nasopharyngeal specimens. Lower respiratory tract pathogens are found insputum specimens. 4.5.1 Materials required lTransport media - bacterial and viral. lThroat (Dacron clean sterile containers (minimum volume 25ml). 4.5.2 Upper respiratory tract specimens4.5.2.1 Method of collecting a Throat Swab lHold the tongue down with the tongue depressor. Use a strong light source to locate areas of inflammation and exudate in the posterior pharynx and thetonsillar region of the throat behind the uvula. lRub the area back and forth with a cotton or Dacron swab. lCare must be taken to sample the posterior pharyngeal wall at the end toavoid gagging by the patient. lWithdraw the swab without touching cheeks, teeth or gums and insert into asterile screw-cap test tube containing appropriate transport medium required. lBreak off the top part of the stick without touching the tube and tighten thescrew cap firmly.30lLabel the specimen containers. lComplete the laboratory request form. 4.5.2.2 Method of collecting per-nasal and post-nasal swabs lSeat the patient comfortably, tilt the head back and insert the nasal speculum. lInsert a flexible calcium alginate/Dacron swab through the speculum parallel to the floor of nose without pointing upwards. Alternately, bend the wire andinsert it into the throat and move the swab upwards into the nasopharyngealspace. lRotate the swab on the nasopharyngeal membrane a few times, remove itcarefully and insert it into a screw-cap tube containing transport medium. lBreak off the top part of the stick without touching the tube and tighten thescrew cap firmly. lLabel the specimen tube. 4.5.2.3 Method of collecting nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate lHave the patient sit with the head tilted slightly backward. lFlush a plastic catheter or tubing with 2-3 ml of VTM/sterile normal saline. lInstill 1-1.5 ml normal into one nostril. lInsert the tubing into the nostril parallel to the palate and aspiratenasopharyngeal secretions. lRepeat this procedure with the other nostril. lCollect 1-2 ml in a sterile vial and transport in cold chain at 2-8\u00b0C 4.5.3 Lower respiratory tract specimens 4.5.3.1 Method of collecting sputum (Pl refer to chapter no 14) lInstruct patient to take a deep breath and cough up sputum directly into a wide-mouth sterile container. Avoid saliva or postnasal discharge. Minimumvolume should be about 1 ml. lLabel the specimen containers. lComplete the laboratory request form. 4.5.4 Handling and transportation lAll respiratory specimens except sputum are transported in appropriate bacterial/viral media. lTransport as quickly as possible to the laboratory to reduce overgrowth bycommensal oral flora.31lFor transit periods up to 24 hours, transport specimens for bacterial isolation at ambient temperature and viruses at 4-8\u00b0C in appropriate media. 4.6 POST-MORTEM SPECIMEN COLLECTION Need to be collected during outbreak situation when causative agent in not known. Strict precautions, including respiratory protection from aerosolized particles, must betaken when carrying out post-mortem specimen collection in communicable diseaseoutbreaks. Collect the specimens as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hour sinceviral titres decline while bacteria multiply rapidly after death. Experienced medicalpersonnel may only accomplish thorough post-mortem examinations. 4.6.1 Materials required lBarrier precautions: double gloves, sterile gown, eye goggles, mask lFor collecting blood and other fluids, refer to corresponding sections for materials lAseptic surgical and biopsy instruments for collecting tissue specimens lFixatives: saline formalin for histology lSterile saline, appropriate viral and bacterial transport media lSterile containers, sterile screw cap tubes or vials, glass slides and slide box lDisinfectant such as household bleach diluted 1:10 in water. 4.6.2 Method of collection lUse a separate sterile instrument for each tissue specimen from affected sites (several fragments with 1-2 grams of each is sufficient). Smaller, but adequate,specimens may be taken with a biopsy needle. lPlace different tissues in separate sterile containers containing the relevantmedium (sterile saline for preparation of tissues for immunofluorescencemicroscopy; and microbiological transport media for the isolation of bacterialand viral pathogens, fixatives for histopathology). lLabel all containers and tighten the screw caps firmly. lBlood may be taken from the heart cavities. lIf cerebral malaria is suspected, make several smears from the cerebral cortexon glass slides to detect Plasmodium falciparum. Label the slides and transportin a slide box. 4.6.3 Handling and transportation lFixed specimens can be stored and transported at ambient temperature. lTissue specimens for isolation of bacterial pathogens can be transported at ambient temperature in transport media for up to 24 hours.32lTransport tissue specimens for isolation of viral pathogens in viral transport medium or sterile saline at 4-8\u00b0C for 24-48 hours. For longer periods, freezeand store at -70\u00b0C. lIf rabies is suspected and brain samples are collected, freeze unfixed specimensimmediately after collection. Formalin-fixed samples are also useful and maybe transported at ambient temperature. 4.7 COLLECTION OF WATER SAMPLE FOR BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION Please refer to chapter (8 ) on bacteriological water testing for details of materials required and procedure 4.8 LABELLING AND IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIMENS In a diagnostic investigation the information contained in the case investigation form is collected along with the specimen. Each patient should be assigned a uniqueidentification number. This unique identification number and the patient name shouldbe present on all specimens, epidemiological data forms, and the laboratory transmittalforms and used as a common reference. Preprinted labels should be used whenever possible. The label should be permanently affixed to the specimen container. It should contain the: Patient' name Identification No. Specimen typeDate of collection Time Glass slides for microscopy must be labeled individually,using glass marking pencil.This should not interfere with the staining process. Each slide should bear: Patient' name Unique Identification No.Date of collection 4.8.1 Case Investigation Form A case investigation form should be completed for each patient at the time of collection, and should be kept together for analysis and later reference. A laboratoryrequest must be completed for each specimen and contain information to interpret thenecessary tests. This may include: lPatient information: age (or date of birth), sex, complete address lClinical information - date of onset of symptoms, clinical and immunizationhistory, risk factors or contact history where relevant, antimicrobial drugs takenprior to specimen collection lLaboratory information - acute or convalescent specimen, other specimensfrom the same patient.33The receiving laboratory should record: lDate and time when the specimen was received lName and initials of the person receiving specimen lRecord of specimen quality. For a large number of patients it may be practical to submit the requests to each relevant laboratory as a 'line listing', i.e. a summary request form compiling the necessarydata An example of one such case investigation and laboratory transmittal forms is annexed (Annexure I & II). 4.9 TRANSPORT OF SPECIMENS4.9.1 Precautions lBefore transport, notify the receiving laboratory of all shipping and specimen details in advance of specimen arrival. lIf international transport is necessary, laboratory should organize authorizationto import the specimens lWhile arranging for transportation, provision should also be made forinformation to the sender on receipt or non-receipt of the specimens. 4.9.2 Surface transport/courier service lSecurely fasten transport boxes in the transport vehicle. lIn the vehicle, keep a spill kit containing absorbent materials, chlorine disinfectant, heavy-duty reusable gloves, mask, apron, goggles, and leak proofwaste disposal container. lArrange for an adequate amount of refrigerant in case of delays in the travelschedule so that the cold chain is maintained. lAvoid extensive vibration of samples, such as that encountered when travelingfor long periods over rough roads as this can haemolyse samples, renderingthem useless. If possible, separate the serum from clotted blood samples beforetransport. 4.9.3 Air transport/postal service lDiagnostic specimens may be sent by mail in conformance with all relevant international, national, and commercial carrier requirements. lContact with the postal authorities should be established prior to the collectionof samples to ensure their ability to transport the materials and to verifyunderstanding of the shipping requirements.34 4.9.4 Basic triple packaging system and maintenance of transit temperature lThe specimen should be transported in a basic triple packaging system (as described below) to ensure biosafety, transient temperature and quality of thespecimen. lThe specimen is in the labeled primary container which must be watertight,airtight, and wrapped in absorbent material (e.g. cotton wool) in case ofleakage. After tightening the cap, apply sealing tape, for example parafilm/water proof plastic tape, over the cap and top of the specimen container. lSealed specimens container must be placed in a suitably sizes plastic bagstogether small amount of absorbent material. The bag must be sealed,alternatively ziploc bags may be used. Two or more sealed specimens fromthe same patient may be placed in a larger plastic bag and sealed. Specimens from different patients should never be sealed in the same bag. lPlace the sealed bags containing the specimens inside secondary plasticcontainers with screw-capped lids. Provided the specimens have been double-bagged properly in sealed plastic bags, specimens from several patients maybe packed inside the same secondary plastic container. Place additionalabsorbent material inside the secondary container to cushion multiple primaryreceptacles and absorb any leakage that may occur. Tape a biohazard labeland the laboratory request form sealed in a plastic bag to the outside of thissecondary container. lThe outer package or tertiary container protects the contents from physicaldamage and water while in transit. It should have a resistant, high-densityexternal cover (e.g. metal, wood, or fibreboard), shock-absorbent padding35on the inside, and a tight-fitting lid. The outer package must be leak-proof and well insulated, and can contain ice, cold packs or dry ice when required.EPI vaccine carriers or other commercially made containers may be used as atertiary container to transport. Vaccine Carriers that have been used for specimen transport must never be reused for carrying vaccines. lThe rigid outer package is placed within an outer carton of double-plycorrugated cardboard or plastic, and a biohazard label is applied. lThe specimen carriers and ice packs can be reused after disinfection (seeAnnex 11). 4.9.5 Maintenance of transit temperature 4-8 degree C lFit the transport box with a minimum of 4 ice packs or more if room is available, around the secondary container. This will maintain refrigeration for 2-3 days. Note-: lAvoid repeated thawing and freezing of specimens. lFreeze the specimen only if transport is assured at -200C. lStore and transport all specimens at 2-80C, except CSF obtained from suspected cases of pyogenic meningitis.36ANNEXURE-I Case Investigation form (To be filled in by the clinician/ epidemiologist) of hospitalization/ reporting to the district level: Occupation:Clinical signs & symptoms (with duration):Treatment history:Results of previous investigations (if any):Any other relevant information:Specimen details: Nature of specimen (s) Date of collection Investigation required Details of sender: Signature: Name of sender: Address of sender: Fax: E-mail: (NOTE: Please complete all the columns.

Check loop/ wire etc. by touching a portion ofthe medium to be inoculated. vHeat the loop vertically so that the entire length of the loop is heated. vDip the loop in disinfectant solution before heating to avoidsplattering. 5.5.1.2 Hot air Sterilization 5.5.1.2.1 Purpose The method is used for sterilizing the material like dry glass test tubes, petri dishes, flasks, glass pipettes, all glass syringes etc. and instruments like forceps, scalpels etc. 5.5.1.2.2 Equipment required Sterilization by hot air should be carried out in an oven which should at least have the following features. lElectrically operated (alternative gas or kerosene oil). lFitted with the thermostat to control the temperature. lDevice to indicate the temperature of inside chamber of the oven when inuse. lShould be fitted with adjustable shelves. lProvided with fan to ensure uniform distribution of heat in different partsof the oven. 5.5.1.2.3 Procedure lArrange the material (pre washed & packed) to be sterilized, loosely and evenly on the racks of the oven so that air can circulate properly and heat44the load evenly in the oven. lSwitch on the power supply (or alternative devise gas/ kerosene oil). lControl the temperature of the oven by adjusting the thermostat knob. lNote the time when desired temperature is reached (Heating time). lHold the load on the same temperature for the specified period as mentioned below. Temperature Holding Time 160 \u00b0C 60 minutes. 170 \u00b0C 40 minutes. 180 \u00b0C 30 minutes. lThe most common temperature for hot air oven for sterilization is 160 \u00b0Cfor 60 min. lOn expiry of the holding time period, switch off the power supply andallow the oven to cool down slowly. lPut down the date of sterilization on each packet and store in dust freearea for future use. lMake daily records of the equipment/ material sterilized as per theproforma given below. Date Detail of all items Temp. at Starting Heating Holding Remarks Sterilized. which time time time Sterilized From/ to From/ to From/to 5.5.1.2.4 GLP \u00f0Dry up all the material before putting into sterilization in hot air oven. \u00f0Don't place heat sensitive material inside the oven. \u00f0As air is poor conductor of heat, do not pack the material to be sterilized in the oven too tightly. \u00f0After holding time is over, hot air oven is switched off, wait until the temperature of the oven falls below 80\u00b0C. Only then open the doorof the oven to take out the material other wise opening immediatelyafter holding time leads to breaking of the glassware and may alsocause injuries to the operator.455.5.2 Moist heat Moist heat or steam under pressure is one of the most efficient method of sterilization. Depending upon the material to be sterilized moist heat can be applied in differentforms as discussed below. 5.5.2.1 Below Intermitent exposure at 75 - 80\u00b0C for 20 - 45 minutes on three successive days. lBoiling at 100\u00b0C for 5 - 10 minutes. lSteaming at 100\u00b0C for 1 hr. 5.5.2.2. Steaming under pressure (Autocalving )5.5.2.2.1 Purpose Saturated steam under pressure is more efficient way of sterilization as compared to dry heat because \u00f0It provides greater lethal action. \u00f0It is quicker in heating up the exposed articles. \u00f0It penetrates the porous material such as cotton wool, stoppers, paper, cloth wrapper etc. 5.5.2.2.2 Principle When water boils its vapour pressure is equal to surrounding atmospheric pressure. When boiling is done in a closed vessel, there is increase in the inside pressure of vesselwhich raises the temperature of boiling water above 100\u00b0C. 5.5.2.2.3 Item to be sterilized Autoclave is mostly suitable for. \u00f0Sterilization of culture media, aqueous solution. \u00f0Decontamination of discarded culture and other laboratory garbage. \u00f0Rubber guard, gloves, stoppers with rubber liner, glassware with rubber attachment, glass metal syringes,throat swabs etc. 5.5.2.2.4 Type of Autoclaves In principal two type of autoclaves are used \u00f0Pressure cooker type. \u00f0Gravity displacement type. 5.5.2.2.4.1 Pressure cooker type This is the most common type of autoclave used for sterilization. It has vertical chamber with a strong metal lid, which can be fastened down, and sealed with rubber46gasket. An air steam discharger tap, pressure gauze and safety cum pressure adjustable valve are fitted on the lid. Water in the bottom of the autoclaves is heated electrically (orby some other device like gas burner/ kerosene oil). 5.5.2.2.4.1.1 Procedure \u00f0Arrange the material (pre washed & packed) to be sterilized. \u00f0Ensure that there is sufficient quantity of water in the chamber at the time of autoclaving by checking water level device provided with the equipment. \u00f0Place the material to be sterilized in wire basket/ perforated container loosely. \u00f0Place the container on perforated rack placed above the level of the water. \u00f0Fasten the lid tightly with steam discharge valve open. \u00f0Switch on the power and allow the water to boil. \u00f0When water boils, steam will come out of the discharge valve so that air from chamber may be expelled. \u00f0Wait till total air inside the chamber has been replaced by steam. This can be checked by connecting one end of the rubber tube to the dischargevalve and immersing other end of tube into the bucket containing water.The discharge gas will pass through the water, steam will condense andair will bubble through water. When bubbles cease, it means that airfrom chamber has been expelled. \u00f0Close the steam discharge valve. \u00f0Adjust the valve to predetermined pressure (Normally autoclaves are adjusted at 15 lbs/ sq inch.). \u00f0Allow the pressure to increase to preadjusted pressure. \u00f0Note the time when pressure gauze indicates the requisite pressure is achieved. \u00f0Allow to continue the same for required time period as indicated below. Temp Pressure Time 115\u00b0C 10 lbs/ inch. 20 - 30 min.121\u00b0C 15 lbs/ inch 15- 20 min.132\u00b0C 27 lbs/ inch 2 min. Holding time increases to 30-45min if at 121\u00b0C and 15 lbs pressure if plastic wares are sterilized \u00f0At the end of holding time switch off the power supply. \u00f0Allow the autoclave to cool slowly which can be seen by gradual decrease in pressure till it shows zero reading.47\u00f0Allow the wrapping paper to be dried. \u00f0Put date on each article and place in dust free area for future use. 5.5.2.2.4.1.2 GLP \u00f0Ensure that air from chamber has been expelled completely because air steam mixture has a lower temperature than steam e.g.temperature of 50% air & 50% steam mixture will be112\u00b0C insteadof 121\u00b0C provided by the pure steam. \u00f0Air also hinders the penetration of steam in to the interior of the porous material and narrow opening container. Air being denserthan steam tends to form a separate cooler layer in the bottom of theautoclave. \u00f0As the simple autoclave lack means for drying the load after sterilization, it is therefore important to avoid placing sterilized articles in contactwith unsterilized objects/ surface unless the wrapping is dried \u00f0To check the efficacy of autoclave, each cycle should be run using chemical indicator tape. 5.5.2.2.4.1.3 Record Keeping Daily recording of each run for sterilization of material should be maintained e.g. Date Detail of Pressure at Starting Heating Holding Chemical items to which time time time indicatorbe sterilization From To From To tape (colour sterilized done changed) 5.5.2.2.4.1.4 Quality control To check the efficacy of auotclave each run should be accompanied by placing chemical indicator which changes color if the instruments is working satisfactory. Thiscan be achieved by placing chemical indicator tape inside the tube in the center ofautoclave and check the change in color after the operation is over. Indicator tape Indicator tape Before Autoclaving After Autoclaving 48CHAPTER - 6 COMMON STAINING TECHNIQUES IN A DISTRICT LABORATORY 6.1 GRAM'S STAINING This is one of the most common staining procedure used for examining specimens suspected to contain bacteriologic agents. Direct microscopic examination of specimensand cultures can provide a rapid presumptive diagnosis. Gram staining can giveinformation regarding the shape of cell,the type of cell arrangement (single chained,clustered) the gram reaction that can provide a quick assessment of what the etiologicagent may be. 6.1.1 PrincipleCertain bacteria when treated with one of the basic para rosaniline dyes such as Methyl Violet, Crystal Violet or Gentian Violet (which is a mixture of two preceding dyes) andthen with Iodine, fix the stain so that subsequent treatment with a decolourizing agent-e.g. alcohol or acetone does not remove the colour. Other organisms however, aredecolourized by this process. Thus, if a mixture of various organisms are stained andsubjected to decolourizing agents, it is found that some retain the dye, and these aretermed Gram-Positive whereas others are completely decolourized and are termed as Gram-Negative . In order to render the decolourized organism visible, and to distinguish them from those retaining the colour, a counter stain is then applied. This counter stain is usuallyred so that the gram-negative organism which appear reddish pink in colour may easilybe differentiated from gram-positive organism, which retain the original violet stain. 6.1.2 Specimens Smear prepared from any of the following e.g. throat swab, nasal swab, deposit of urine,bacterial culture, vaginal discharge etc.can be stained by this method. 6.1.3 Materials 1) Crystal violet (0.5%) 5) Safranine (0.5%) 2) Iodine crystals. 6) Distilled water3) iodide 7) Ethyl alcohol.4) Solution 'A (Crystal violet-0.5%) Crystal violet -------- water -------- 100 6.1.4.2 Solution (Gram's Iodide gmDistilled water ------- 100 ml Grind potassium iodide and iodine and dissolve in not more than 20 ml of distilled water. Make up the volume to 100 ml with distilled water. 6.1.4.3 Solution 'C' (Safranine-0.5%) Dissolve 0.5 gm safranine in 10 ml alcohol and make up the volume to 100 ml with distilled water. 6.1.5 Procedure lAppropriate smear is made on a clean glass slide. l The smear is fixed by passing the slide over flame 2-3 times quickly. lCover the slide with crystal violet solution and allow to act for about 30 seconds. lPour off stain and holding the slide at an angle downwards pour on theiodine solution on the slide so that it washes away the crystal violet Coverthe slide with fresh iodine solution and allow to act for 1 minute. lWash off the iodine with ethanol and treat with fresh alcohol, tilt the slidefrom side to side until colour ceases to come out of the preparation. Thisis easily seen by holding the slide against a white background or Decolorize with 100% acetone. First tip off the iodine and hold the slide at a steep slope. Then pour acetone over the slide from its upper end, soas to cover its whole surface. Decolorization is very rapid and is usuallycomplete in 2-3 seconds. After this period of contact, wash thoroughlywith water under a running tap lApply the counterstain (0.5% safranine) for 30 seconds. lWash with water and blot dry. lExamine the smear under oil immersion microscopy.506.1.6 Result Violet stained ------------- Gram-Positive Reddish pink bacteria ------------- Gram- Negative 6.1.7 Quality Control To obviate errors from over decolorizing, a control smear of a known gram positive organism (.e.g. a pure culture of Staphylococcus aureus) may be prepared on one endof slide and a smear of gram negative organism e.g. E.coli be prepared on the otherend of the slide. The smears thus prepared should be stained by the grams stain asdescribed. The smear prepared from Staphylococcus aureus should show violet colouredbacteria whereas the one made from E. coli should show pink coloured bacteria. 6.2 ALBERT'S STAININGAlbert's staining is most common staining technique used for examining the specimens, suspected to have Corynebacterium diphtheriae; which are gram positive rods of varyinglength and often containing volutin (polyphosphate) granules which appears purpleblack against the light green cytoplasm of the bacillus. 6.2.1 Specimens Throat swab/nasal swab smear or bacterial culture from suspected cases of C. diphtheriae. 6.2.2 Materials \u00f0Toluidine blue \u00f0 ml. Dissolve the dyes in alcohol and add to the water and acetic acid. Allow to stand for one day and then filter.516.2.3.2 Albert's -II \u00f0Iodine----------------- 6 gms \u00f0Potassium 6.2.4 Procedure for staining \u00f0Make a smear, dry in air, and fix by heat. \u00f0Cover slide with Albert's stain -I and leave for 4-6 minutes. \u00f0Wash in water and blot dry. \u00f0Cover the slide with Albert's stain -II and allow to act for 1-2 mins. \u00f0Wash, blot dry and examine under oil immersion lens of microscope. 6.2.5 Result C.diphtheriae appear as bacilli with dark green protoplasm and purple black granules, other bacteria will stain light green. 6.2.6 Quality Control In order to check the quality of the reagents and the staining procedure, prepare smear of a standard Corynebacterium diphtheriae culture (positive control) and another smear from standard E.coli culture (negative control). Stain both smear using the standard Albert staining procedure as described C.diphtheriae appear as bacilli with dark greenprotoplasm and black granules, whereas smear of E.coli will stain light green. Thesecontrol cultures can be supplied by NICD, Delhi on request 6.3 STAINING FOR MALARIAL PARASITE6.3.1 Malaria Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium species. In India, the disease is commonly caused by P.vivax and P.falciparum. The laboratory diagnosis is based ondemonstration of different stages of the parasite in the peripheral blood film of thepatient. 6.3.2 Collection of sample6.3.2.1 Peripheral blood smear: Time for taking blood lCollect blood either during or 2-3 hours after the peak of temperature. lSamples should be taken before administration of antimalarial drugs. 6.3.3 Preparation of blood smear lBoth thick and thin films should be made on the same slide. lBlood samples should be collected from the tip of the ring finger of the left52hand. However in small children, sample should be collected either from the heal or the tip of the big toe of the foot taking all aseptic precautions using asterile needle or a lancet lApply gentle pressure to the finger and collect a single small drop of blood onthe middle of the slide. This is for the thin film. Apply further pressure toexpress moreblood and collect 2 or 3 large drops on the slide about 1 cmfrom the drop intended for the thin film. Wipe the remaining blood away fromthe finger with cotton wool. 6.3.3.1 Thin film Thin film and thick film prepration. Refer to section 4.2.3 of chapter-4 6.3.2.2 Thick film Allow the thick film to dry in a flat level position protected from flies, dust and extreme heat. Label the dry film with a pen or marker pencil, by writing across thethicker portion of the film the patient's name or number and the date. Do not use a ballpen to label the slide. Wrap the dry slide in clean paper and dispatch with the patient's records form to the laboratory as soon as possible. The slide used for spreading the blood films must be disinfected and should then be used for the next patient, another clean slide from the pack being used as a spreader. 6.3.4 Staining of blood 1) Giemsa powder/ ready Geimsa stain solution. 2) Alcohol. 3) Methanol.4) Marking pens. 5) Staining jars. 6) Boric acid buffer -pH 7.2. 6.3.4.1.2 Preparation lDissolve the stain powder in alcohol as per the manufacturer's instructions. lPrepare borax acid-boric buffer as below:a) Dissolve 12.4 gms of boric acid in 1 lit. of distilled water ----Solution-I b) Dissolve 19.05 gm borax in 1 lit of distilled water -Solution-II.53Take 50 ml of solution I and adjust the pH to 7.2 using appropriate volume of solution II. Then make up the volume to 200 ml with distilled water. 6.3.4.1.3 Staining technique lPrepare thick and thin smear from malaria case on a glass slide. lDehaemoglobinize the thick smear by placing the film in a vertical position in a glass jar containing distilled water for 5 minutes. When film becomeswhite, take it out and dry in upright position. lFix the thin smear in methanol for 15 minutes. lDilute the geimsa's stain solution, one part with 9 parts of boric buffer pH7.2. lImmerse the smears in this stain for 1 hour. lWash the smear in buffer solution. lBlot dry. lExamine the slide under oil immersion of microscope. 6.4 J.S.B.STAIN (JASWANT SINGH AND BHATTACHARJEE STAIN) DEVELOPED AT NICD, DELHI 6.4.1 Material and reagents lEosin yellow water. 6.4.2 Preparation6.4.2.1 J.S.B.- II Dissolve 2 gm eosin yellow in 1 lit. of distilled water and store in the dark for 4 weeks before use. 6.4.2.2 J.S.B-I lDissolve 1 gm of methylene blue in 600 ml of distilled water and mix well. lAdd 1 % sulphuric acid (6.0 ml) drop by drop and shake well.54lAdd 1 gm of potassium dichromate and shake well till precipitation occurs. lDissolve the precipitate by adding 7 gm. of di-sodium hydrogen phosphate (dihydrate). lMake up the volume to 1 lit. lBoil the stain in round bottom flask over a heating mantle for one hour. lCool the stain and re-adjust the volume to 1 lit by adding distilled water. lStore in dark for 4 weeks before use. 6.4.3 Staining technique lPrepare thin and thick smear from malaria cases on micro slides. lDe- haemoglobinise the thick smear (ref. section 6.3.4.1.3) lFix the thin smear in methanol for few minutes. lTake 3 staining jars for J.S.B.-I, J.S.B -II and tap water. lDip the smear in J.S.B-II for few seconds and immediately wash in water. lDrain the slides free of excess water. lDip the smear in J.S.B-I for 30-40 seconds. lWash well in water and dry. lExamine the smears under oil immersion. 6.4.4 Observation Examine thin film first. If no parasite is found then only examine thick film. If parasite are seen in the thick film but the identity is not clear, thin film should be re-examinedmore thoroughly so as to determine the nature of infection 6.4.5 Thin film examination lArea of the film examined should be along the upper and lower margins of tail end film as parasites are concentrated over there. lA minimum of 100 fields should be examined in about 8-10 minutes. 6.4.5.1 The following stages of the parasite can be observed in a peripheral blood thin smear lRing, trophozoite, schizont and the gametocytes in case of infected erythrocytes are usually enlarged in P. vivax. lHowever, in case of P. falciparum infection, it is mainly the ring stageswhich are seen and occasionally schizonts and trophozoites. During thelate stages of the disease even crescent shaped gametocytes can be seenin the peripheral blood.556.4.6. Observation on thick smear lOnly elements seen are leucocytes and malarial parasites. lMorphology of malarial parasites is distorted. lSpecies of parasites cannot be identified. 6.4.6.1 Appearance in thick film lTrophozoites appear as streaks of blue cytoplasm with detached nuclear dots. The ring forms are rarely seen. lSchizonts and gametocytes, however, retain their normal appearanceand are seen if present in the smear (the pigments are seen more clearly). 6.5 NEGATIVE (INDIA INK) STAINING Negative staining is sometimes a very useful technique for demonstrating the capsulated organisms like Meningococcus/Pneumococcus/Cryptococcus, the causativeagents of meningitis 6.5.1 pipettes 6.5.2 Procedure 1) Using a Pasteur pipette, put a drop of CSF sediment (obtained after Centrifuging the CSF at 2000-3000 rpm for10-15 mts) or any otherappropriate specimen on a clean glass slide. 2) Add another smaller drop of Indian Ink (about 1/3rd the size of CSF drop) on the slide. Mix the two drops thoroughly using a match stick. 3) Put a coverslip on the resultant mixture.4) Examine the preparation under the microcope first using 40x objective and then 100x objective to look for the characteristic encapsulated cells56CHAPTER - 7 PREPARATION OF COMMON CULTURE MEDIA 7.1 DE- HYDRATED CULTURE MEDIA 7.1.1 Some points to be remembered lAlways receive media prior to the expiry date label marked on the container and for media preparation follow the manufacturer's instructions. lMost dehydrated culture media are hygroscopic; hence always keep containerbottle tightly closed. lStore media bottle in dark place at room temperature away from moisture. lSince there could be batch-to-batch variation of media, it is advisable to checkevery new receipt (new batch) of media with growth characteristics of controlstrains (ATCC, NCTC, MTCC strains) and or locally available strains growthof which is desirable. lIt is advisable to use freshly prepared culture plates as far as possible & cultureplate should be used within 2-5 days of preparation. lPrepared media is kept in fridge in sealed plastic bags to prevent mediagetting dried up. lFor media preparation distilled water/de-ionized water should be used andall glassware's for preparation should be thoroughly washed and autoclavedas per the laid down procedure. lAvoid formation of air bubbles during media pouring as far as possible. lFor sterility checking of the media, incubate at least 1-2 uninoculated platefrom each new batch of prepared media at 37\u00b0C incubator and check forgrowth of any contaminating bacteria after over-night incubation. lMedia pouring room should be a clean, enclosed space without any outsideair current and with UV light facility preferably. lFollowing autoclaving of media there is usually a fall in pH of about 0.2 to0.4, hence adjust the pH to a bit higher side (0.2 - 0.4 or so) than the pHindicated on the media bottle prior to autoclaving. lAll pH measurement are to be done at room temperature i.e. at 25\u00b0C lpH adjustments are done with either 1N-NaOH for alkalinity or with 1N-HClfor acidity. lWhile boiling dehydrated culture media, gently heat with mixing in betweenso as to prevent overheating of the media. lHeat sensitive ingredients that need to be added in the media may be pre-sterilized prior to addition in the media.57lNon- absorbent type of cotton wool is used for plugging test tubes/ flasks etc. of media always. lFor preparing 1 Litre of Media, bigger glass flask either 2 or 3 litre is chosento avoid boiled media touching the cotton plug by way of bumping of themedia. lArrange all reagents/materials/ glassware 1N-NaOH, 1N-HcL, etc. before starting mediapreparation. lMost culture media available these days are of dehydrated media - whichneed to be just mixed by heating and then distributed on to plates/tubes. lThough there is no need to check pH of dehydrated media (as the mediacomes pre checked for pH) still it is useful to check pH once after the mediagets dissolved in water so as to ensure correctness of pH as per the bottlelabel, and in case of any change of pH observed following dissolution thesame may be corrected with addition of 1N-NaOH or 1N-HCl. 7.2 MACCONKEY'S BROTH (DOUBLE STRENGTH) WITH NEUTRAL RED 7.2.1 Water Testing Media7.2.1.1 Ingredients gms/ 0.2 7.2.1.2 For double strength media Weigh exactly 80.15 gm of dehydrated media.

It would neither be practicable,nor is it necessary, to test a sample of drinking water for all the pathogens that mightpossibly be present in it, as that would involve many different procedures, a multitude ofmedia and other materials, incubation conditions etc. It would, therefore, be sufficient ifwe can determine whether the water sample was recently contaminated with faeces. Ifwe could establish that water was recently contaminated with faeces, such water is notfit for human consumption, as there would be a possibility that such water might harbourpathogenic organisms. Therefore, by establishing faecal contamination of water, wewill be able to infer upon its potablility or otherwise. 8.1 IN THE LABORATORY THERE ARE TWO SIMPLE PROCEDURES OF TESTING WATER SAMPLES FOR FAECAL CONTAMINATION 8.1.1 Most Probable Number (MPN) method for coliform bacteria - using the multiple tube fermentation technique: In this method the MPN of total coliform bacteria, faecalcoliform bacteria (or the thermotolerant coliforms) present in the water sample isdetermined along with the presence/absence of Escherichia coli. The coliform bacteriaand E. coli are the universal indicators of faecal pollution. 8.1.2 H 2S-Strip method: This is a simple, reliable and easy-to-perform (by even untrained personnel), 'Presence/Absence' test for bacteriological quality, which works on theprinciple that there is a close correlation between faecal contamination and the presenceof hydrogen sulphide (H 2S) producing bacteria and, that faecal pollution of water can be deduced by demonstration of H2S production. It has been claimed, by various workers, that the H2S-strip method shows >90% agreement with the conventional MPN test described above. The two test procedures are described below in detail. 8.2 SPECIMENS8.2.1 General instructions for collection, storage and transport of water samples for bacteriological examination 1 Care must be taken to ensure that samples are representative of the water being examined. 2 Care must be taken to see that no accidental contamination occurs during sampling; The sample collector must wash his/her hands well, using carbolic soap, just priorto collection of samples.673 Test the water samples as soon as possible after collection. If delay of more than 3 hours is expected, transport samples to laboratory under cold-chain conditions. 4 A volume of water sample adequate to carry out all the tests should be collected; generally 200-250 mL of water sample should be collected. 5 Do not fill the sampling bottle up to the brim; a vacant space of 2-3 cm should be left for effective shaking of the sample, prior to testing in the laboratory. 8.2.2 Containers for sample collection1. Samples for bacteriological examination shall be collected in : lClean, sterilized, narrow mouthed neutral borosilicate glass bottles; OR lAutoclavable plastic (poly propylene) bottles with screw cap lids, of 250, 500 or 1000 ml capacity. 2. The glass bottle shall have a ground glass stopper having an overlapping rim. The stopper shall be relaxed by an intervening strip of paper between the stopper andthe neck of the bottle. Glass bottles of suitable capacity with autoclavable screwcap lids may also be used. 3. The stopper and the neck of the bottle shall be protected by paper or parchment cover. 4. Collection bottles shall be sterilized : lIn hot-air oven, at 160oC for 1 hr (only glass bottles); OR lIn an autoclave at 1.02 \u00b1 0.03 kg/cm2 gauge pressure (15 \u00b1 0.5 psi gauge pressure 120oC temperature approximately), for 15 minutes, if plastic bottles are to be sterilized, they should be autoclaved for 30 minutes. Note-1: Discard bottles which have chips, cracks and etched surfaces. Before use, bottles should be thoroughly cleaned with detergent and hot water, followedby a hot water rinse to remove all traces of detergent. Then rinse them 3 timeswith laboratory deionized water. Note-2: A chelating agent should be added to sample bottles used to collect samples suspected to contain > 0.01 mg/L of heavy metals such as copper, lead, zinc,nickel etc. Add 0.3 mL of 15% EDTA-Na for each 125 mL of sample. Note-3: Dechlorination - If the water to be sampled contains or is likely to contain chlorine, sodium thiosulphate shall be added to the clean, dry sampling bottles,before sterilization, in an amount to provide an approximate concentration of100 mg/L in the sample. This can be done by adding 0.5 mL of 5% thiosuphatesolution to a 250 ml bottle.688.2.3 Collection of samples from taps: 1. Most samples will be taken from taps in treatment works, storage tanks, domestic premises (houses) or from public standpipes. When the distribution system issampled, both domestic and community taps, including public fountains must beselected with care. 2. Samples should not be taken from taps which leak between the spindle and gland, as water from the outside of the tap may contaminate the sample. 3. External fittings such as filters, rubber or plastic nozzles and other anti-splash devices should be removed before collection. 4. Wiping of the tap surface with alcohol gauze /swab and flaming, using a spirit lamp (or even a cigarette lighter), should be considered an optional procedure. 5. The tap should be kept open, for free flow/run of water (at a moderate speed), for at least 1 minute prior to collection; this step will ensure flushing away of stagnantwater in the pipe, before the sample collection. 8.2.4 Collection of samples from Stream/ river/ lake1 Immerse the collection bottle, with its mouth closed by the stopper, a foot below the water surface, and facing the direction of the current. 2 Fill the bottle with water by opening the lid. Bring the bottle to the surface and replace the stopper. 3 Avoid collection of surface water, as it contains high organic matter.8.2.5 Collection of samples from wells1 Where the well is fitted with a hand pump or an electric pump: a. Flame the mouth of the pump (through which water is discharged on pumping); incase of plastic mouth, apply alcohol or rectified spirit and allow it to dry. b. Pump water to waste for four to five minutes, before the sample is collected into the bottle. 2 Where there is no pumping machinery: a. Sample can be collected directly from the well in a sterilized bottle fitted with weight at the bottom; however care must be taken to avoid contamination ofsample by surface scum; b. Where it is not possible to collect the sample directly into the bottle, sample may be obtained by means of a suitable metal jug/ pot. Here, the jug/potshould be sterilized rinsing the inner surface of the container with a smallquantity of methylated spirit and then igniting the same. Then the jug/pot69should be lowered to the required depth and then drawn up and down 2-3 times before it is brought to the surface. Avoid the jug/pot coming into contactwith the bottom of the well or skidding along the surface, so that it may notcollect the surface film. Once the jug/pot containing water is drawn up, samplesfrom it should be poured into sterilized glass/plastic sample collection bottlesand transported to the laboratory for testing. The samples should be properlylabelled indicating source, date and time of collection. 8.3 MATERIALS8.3.1 Equipment and Glassware/Plasticware8.3.1.1 Equipment lIncubator: Required for incubating the fermentation tubes, culture plates etc. Should be capable of maintaining uniform and constant temperatureof 35-37\u00b0C (\u00b10.5\u00b0C) at all times, in all parts. Incubator of water-jacketedtype, with mechanical means of circulating air is preferable. Where the ordinary room temperatures vary excessively, it is desirable that the laboratory incubator be kept in a special room that can bemaintained at a few degrees below the recommended incubatortemperature. Accurate thermometers with bulb constantly immersed inliquid (glycerine, water or mineral oil) should be maintained within theincubator, and daily readings of temperature should be recorded. lWater-bath: Required for carrying out the test for faecal coliforms by incubating the fermentation tubes at 44.5\u00b0C. Should be capable ofmaintaining constant temperatures between 44 and 45\u00b0C.

Nichrome wire is acceptable, but platinum-iridium isbetter. The wire is set in a handle made of metal or glass, of diametersimilar to that of a pencil. To make the inoculation loop, the wire is bentto form a circle 3-4mm in diameter. lCleaning and maintenance equipment: items such as brushes for cleaning tubes, bottles, etc., a waste bin, and a tool kit are required. lSafety equipment: there should be an adequate first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher or other means of fire control in every laboratory. 8.3.1.2 Glassware/Plasticware lPipettes: Pipettes of various convenient sizes (2, 5, 10, 50 mL) will be required. Accuracy of volume delivered is very important and the errorof calibration should not exceed 2.5%. Pipettes with unbroken tips anddistinctively marked graduations should be used. Alternatively disposable(single use) pre-sterilized plastic pipettes may be used in place of glasspipettes. Rubber bulbs or automatic/semi-automatic pipetting deviceshould be used to avoid mouth-pipetting. lSample collection bottles: As mentioned under the previous section on specimen collection and transport. lPetri dishes/plates: Glass or clear plastic (disposable, pre-sterilized) Petri dishes of 100 mm dia., with side wall at least 15 mm high. lMcCartney bottles, with metal (aluminium) screw cap lids and rubberwasher (required for preparing H 2S-Strip vials) lTest-tubes and racks: tubes can be 20.3 x 150mm in size for 10-ml sample volumes plus 10ml of culture medium (screw caps are notrecommended for fermentation media). The racks should be large enoughto accommodate culture tubes of the largest diameter used. lBottles: used for the larger volumes consisting of 50ml of sample and 50ml of culture medium. They should have loose-fitting caps and ideallybe calibrated with 50-ml and 100-ml marks. Conical flasks of 100-150ml capacity may also be used.718.3.1.3 Media preparation equipment: glass or stainless-steel containers (usually flasks) are required. Any heating equipment and stirrers used in the preparationof media should be clean and free from soluble toxic materials. 8.3.1.4 General laboratory equipment: various sizes of round and erlenmeyer flask, beakers, stands, or unbreakable plastic measuring required. 8.3.2 For MPN Coliform test: lMacConkey broth (double strength) with neutral red - available commercially in ready-to-use, dehydrated form from variousmanufacturers; lMacConkey broth (single strength) with Neutral Red - available commercially in ready-to-use, dehydrated form from variousmanufacturers; lBrilliant Green Bile broth (BGB) - available commercially in ready-to- use, dehydrated form from various manufacturers; lTryptone water/Peptone water (for indole test) - available commercially in ready-to-use, dehydrated form from dehydrated form from various manufacturers; lEMB Agar (Levine) - available commercially in ready-to-use, dehydrated form from various manufacturers; lKovac's Reagent - available commercially in ready-to-use form from manufacturers; 8.3.2.2 For H2S- Strip Test Chemicals of Citrobacter freundii (MTCC 1658*)The standard and cultures are used for confirming the isolations made form water samples (E.coli) and for QC of H 2S strip vials prepared in the laboratory (S. typhimurium and Citrobacter freundii) * Obtainable from Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh. 8.4 PROCEDURE 8.4.1 Multiple Tube Fermentation Test For Coliform Bacteria In the multiple-tube method, a series of tubes containing a suitable selective broth culture medium (lactose containing broth, such as MacConkey broth) is inoculated withtest portions of a water sample. After a specified incubation time at a given temperature,each tube showing gas formation is regarded as \"presumptive positive\" since the gasindicates the possible presence of coliforms. However, gas may also be produced byother organisms, and so a subsequent confirmatory test is essential. The two tests areknown respectively as the presumptive test and the confirmatory test. For the confirmatory test, a more selective culture medium (brilliant green bile broth) is inoculated with material taken from the positive tubes. After an appropriateincubation time, the tubes are examined for gas formation as before. The most probablenumber (MPN) of bacteria present can then be estimated from the number of tubesinoculated and the number of positive tubes obtained in the confirmatory test, usingspecially devised statistical tables. This technique is known as the MPN method. Different test portions to provide tenfold serial dilution steps may be used, the dilutions being based on the anticipated number of coliform bacteria in the water samplebeing tested. The reliability of the result obtained depends on the number of tubesinoculated with each test portion; in certain instances, the number can be reduced tothree in each dilution step. Each combination of inoculated tubes will have its own MPNvalues table. 8.4.1.1 The following consumable items are required Culture medium: The following culture media are required- lMacConkey broth with neutral red (Double strength) lMacConkey broth with neutral red (Single Strength) lBrilliant Green Bile broth (BGB)73lLaboratory disinfectant: for cleaning laboratory surfaces and the pipette discard bin. lDetergent: for washing glassware, etc. required when chlorinated supplies are tested.Sodium thiosulfate neutralizes any residual chlorine in samples at thetime of collection, preventing it from acting on any microorganisms presentin water samples. lAutoclave tape. lDiluent: typical diluents include Ringer's solution and phosphate-bufferedsaline. 8.4.1.2 Culture media preparation lCommercially available dehydrated media simplify the preparation of culture broths and are therefore recommended for laboratory work.Various manufacturers produce these media as powders, which can thenbe easily weighed out, dissolved in distilled water, and dispensed intoculture tubes before sterilization. 8.4.1.3 Preparation of media (Refer to chapter 7) Media should be prepared in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, as follows: (a) Dissolve the stated amount of the dehydrated medium in distilled water to obtain the double-strength or single-strength presumptive medium (forconfirmatory analysis, only single-strength medium is used). 8.4.1.4 Procedure For Inoculation Of Samples The procedure to be used for testing relatively unpolluted water, such as treated water from waterworks or distribution system or end user's tap, is described below: 1. Note down the details of the sample collected (from the label on the bottle) in the laboratory register. 2. With the stopper in position, shake the bottle vigorously to achieve a homogeneous dispersion of bacteria. (If the bottle is completely full, removethe stopper and aseptically discard about 20-30ml of water; then replace thestopper and shake. This ensures thorough mixing.) 3. With a sterile 10-ml pipette, inoculate 10 ml of the sample into each of five tubes containing 10 ml of presumptive broth (double strength). Add 50 ml ofsample to a tube containing 50 ml of presumptive broth (double strength) and1 ml sample into each of the five tubes containing 5 ml presumptive broth(single strength). It is advisable to shake the tubes gently to distribute the sampleuniformly throughout the medium.744. Incubate the tubes at 35\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. 5. At the end of the 24-hour incubation period, examine each tube for the presence of gas. If present, gas can be seen in the durham tube. If none is visible, gentlyshake the tube; if any effervescence (streams of tiny bubbles) is observed, thetube should be considered positive. 6. Record the number of positive tubes after 24 hours.7. Re-incubate negative tubes for a further 24-hour period. At the end of this period, check the tubes again for gas production as in 5 above. Gas productionat the end of either 24 or 48 hours' incubation is presumed to be due to thepresence of coliforms in the sample. 8. Record the number of positive tubes after 48 hours.9. The confirmatory test should be carried out at the end of both the 24-hour and the 48-hour incubation. Using a sterile loop, transfer one or two drops fromeach presumptive positive tube into two tubes containing respectivelyconfirmatory broth (BGB) and tryptone water. (Sterilize the inoculation loopbefore each transfer by flaming and allow to cool.) 10. To confirm the presence of thermotolerant coliforms, incubate the subculture tubes from each presumptive positive tube for 24 hours at 44.5 \u00b10.5\u00b0C. 11. At the end of 24 hours' incubation, examine each broth tube for growth and the presence of gas in the durham tube. Record the results, as done previously. 12. To each tube of tryptone water, add approximately 0.1 ml of Kovacs reagent and mix gently. The presence of indole is indicated by a red colour in theKovacs reagent, forming a film over the aqueous phase of the medium. 13. Confirmatory tests positive for indole, growth, and gas production show the presence of E. coli. Growth and gas production in the absence of indoleconfirms thermotolerant coliforms. 8.4.1.5 Determination of MPN For treated water, where one 50-ml and five 10-ml portions are inoculated, the MPN can be found from the test results by refering to the MPN Table (also called McRady'sTable) given in Table- 8.1. 8.4.1.6 Interpretation Water samples are classified, based on the MPN coliform count test, in the following way:75Class Grading Coliform ml E. coli count per 100 (MPN) Class- 1 Excellent 0 0Class- 2 Satisfactory 3 Suspicious 4-10 0 Class- 4 Unsatisfactory >10 0 or more * Presence of E. coli immediately places the sample in Class- 4 8.4.2 H2S-Strip method 8.4.2.1 Description of the test device It simply consists of a pre-calibrated 20 ml glass bottle (McCartney bottle) with a screw-cap lid, from which a strip of specially treated/coated tissue paper hangs down,internally. The whole system is sterile and needs to be opened at the time of watertesting.76Preparation of H2S- Strip medium Composition lPeptone ... 20 hydrogen 0.25 g lWater ... 50 ml * If Teepol is not available, 0.2 g of Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (pure) may be used in its place. Preparation Dissolve the ingradients in 50 ml of water, over gentle heat, and resultant broth is used for soaking the paper strips in the McCartney bottles. 8.4.2.3 Preparation of the test vials 1. Take washed and clean McCartney bottles with aluminium caps lined with rubber washer. 2. Take tissue paper napkins (non-toxic, colourless) of size 80 cm2 and fold them into strips of convenient size to be held in the bottle (approximately 5 cm x 2 cm) 3. Introduce folded tissue paper strips into the bottles with the help of forceps4. Keeping/holding the vials in a slanted position, slowly pipette out 1 ml of the concentrated H 2S- Strip medium, taking care to see that the medium is totally absorbed by the paper strip as it is being added into the bottle. 5. Loosely cap the bottles, after soaking the paper strips with medium, and keep them in a dryer (hot-air oven) at 50\u00b0C, till the paper strips with medium becomecompletely dry. 6. Sterilize the bottles containing dried paper strips in an autoclave at 15 lb/ inch 2, for 15 minutes. Tighten the screw-caps of the bottles prior to removing from the autoclave. 7. Store the test vials in a cool place.8. Each bottle of test vials prepared in the laboratory must be checked for performance using sterile water samples spiked by standard cultures ofSalmonella typhimurium or Citrobacter freundii, which are known producers of H 2S. If the vials do not show good performance by turning black at the end of incubation period, the vials must be rejected and prepared freshly.778.4.2.4 Test procedure: (see Figure- 8.2 ) lPour the water sample to be tested for faecal pollution into the bottle, upto the precalibrated level (20 ml). lIncubate at 37\u00b0C or allow to stand at ambient temperature (30-37\u00b0C); for24-36 hours. No incubator is necessary under field conditions, as the bottlescan be held in the pockets and body temperature can be made use of. lFaecal pollution is indicated if the contents of the bottle turn black. 8.4.2.5 Advantages of H2S-Strip Test lNo need to measure the volume of water to be tested; lNo need to dechlorinate the water sample, since it instantaneously dechlorinates the sample; lThe end point (reading) is very clear, due to development of black colour; lNo incubator is necessary; lThe test starts immediately on collection into the bottle, unlike other methodswhich start after the sample is transported and tested in the laboratory. 8.4.2.6 Disadvantages of H 2S-Strip Test lIn principle, does not conform to the conventional standards of bacteriological testing of water samples. lAt the best, it is a screening test. 1 Fill with water to be tested, up to the arrow mark, andreplace the cap. 2 Keep in a warm place, preferably 30-37\u00b0C, for24-36 hr. 3 Observe for blackening of the contents. 4 If turns black, water is not fit for drinking.

However, it should be noted that orthotolidine is a recognized carcinogen and hence itswide usage is questionable in recent years due to the hazardous nature of the chemicaland also due to the possibility of environmental pollution with a carcinogen. The method based on the use of starch-potassium iodide is not specific for free chlorine, but measures directly the total of free and combined chlorine in the sample.Hence this method is not recommended. In our country the orthotolidine test (OT test) is still being used. 8.5.1 Ortho Tolidine (OT) test It is widely used for field measurements, using simple colour-match comparators, so that testing can be done on site. Yellow colour (in different intensities, dependingupon the level of residual chlorine) is generated following the addition of orthotolidineto the water sample and is matched against standard coloured discs or tubes/ampoulescontaining known standards of orthotolidine solution. The method can be used by staffwithout extensive specialized training. The reagent may be in the form of a solution. Thesolution (OT reagent) should be stored in a brown bottle. Commercial visual comparator technique Commercial comparators are of two basic types-the disc type, containing a wheel of small coloured glasses, and the slide type, containing liquid standards in glassampoules. However, both consist of the same components: a box with an eye-piece infront and two cells; the hole is so arranged that both cells are in the field of vision of theeye-piece. One cell, containing a water sample without the reagents, is placed in line with the rotating coloured glasses or the ampoules containing the standards. The water samplecontaining the reagent is placed in another cell. If free chlorine is present, a colour willdevelop. The concentration of chlorine is estimated by matching the colours in bothcells, as seen through the eye-piece. Each colour of the disc or ampoule corresponds toa certain quantity of chlorine in the water.79Most Probable Number (MPN) values/100 ml of sample, for a set of tests of one 50 ml, five 10 ml, and five 1 ml volumes (McCrady's Statistical Table) Sl. # 100ml ml ml ml 100ml 1 .0 00< 1 2 2 . 1 2 1 7 2 .0 011 2 3 . 1 2 2 1 0 3 .0 022 2 4 . 1 2 3 1 2 4 .0 101 2 5 . 1 3 0 8 5 .0 112 2 6 . 1 3 1 1 1 6 .0 123 2 7 . 1 3 2 1 4 7 .0 202 2 8 . 1 3 3 1 8 8 .0 213 2 9 . 1 3 4 2 1 9 .0 224 3 0 . 1 4 0 1 3 10. 0 3 0 3 31. 1 4 1 17 11. 0 3 1 5 32. 1 4 2 22 12. 0 4 0 5 33. 1 4 3 28 13. 1 0 0 1 34. 1 4 4 35 14. 1 0 1 3 35. 1 4 5 43 15. 1 0 2 4 36. 1 5 0 24 16. 1 0 3 6 37. 1 5 1 35 17. 1 1 0 3 38. 1 5 2 54 18. 1 1 1 5 39. 1 5 3 92 19. 1 1 2 7 40. 1 5 4 161 20. 1 1 3 9 41. 1 5 5 >180 21. 1 2 0 580CHAPTER-9 LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF CHOLERA/GASTROENTERITIS 9.1 TITLE AND SCOPE Gastroenteritis is defined as inflammation of mucous membrane of stomach and intestines resulting in frequent loose motions associated with or without vomitting. Theremay be passage of either mucus or blood or both accompanied by fever and sometimespain abdomen. Any gastroenteritis (also called Diarrhoea) should not be taken lightly, especially in children of small age (below 5 yrs), as it may rapidly lead to dehydration and othercomplications like acidosis, acute tubular necrosis leading to kidney failure / circulatoryfailure and death. More over, cholera should be suspected if there is history of passageof frequent watery / rice water stools and history of effortless vomiting. Similarly, passageof blood in stool should give clue (EPEC) orEnterohaemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC) dysentery. Diarrhoea is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in India. In health institutions, upto one third of total admissions are due to diarrhoeal diseases and upto17 % of all deaths in indoor paediatric patients are due to diarrhoea. 9.2 COMMON ETIOLOGICAL non - infective cases (sometimes) 9.3 Equipments & Supplies No special equipment or material is necessary for stool culture work, provided basic infrastructure for culture work exists. Hence a list of items is given below assumingthat such facility does not exist at district level. The list is indicative only and notcomprehensive. 9.3.1 Glassware lBijou bottle: 8 ml screw capped, with aluminum cap and washer, autoclavable. lGlass slides : 75 mm by 25 mm size, 1.35 mm thick, 50 slides / box lCoverslips: 18 mm by 18 mm size, no 1 size. 10 gm (about 50 coverslips) / packet, 20 packets / box lTest tubes : 15 mm by 125 mm, glass tube with round bottom. lTest tube (sugar tubes ) : 12 mm by 100 mm, glass made with round bottom. lAmber coloured storage bottles 9.3.2 Media lRectal swab: made up of absorbent cotton wool, sterilized lDehydrated culture media like CaryBlair's media 9.3.3 Plastic wares lDisposable petri plates, 88 - 90 mm diameter, polypropylene, individually wrapped, pre -sterilized and disposable. lCotton absorbent: 500 gm pack size 9.3.4 Reagents and stains lCrystal violet stain, ready made. lAlcohol / acetone. lIodine stain, ready made. lpH paper: narrow lSafranin stain, (cylinder). lTable top centrifuge lBinocular microscope. 9.3.7 Accessories lLoop holder lHand lens lNichrome wire lDiscarding jar with disinfectant. 9.4 Specimen collection Voided stool specimen is to be collected as far as possible, if the patient (infant/ small children) is passing loose stool then sterile plastic catheter (disposable) no 26 is tobe used. Collect liquid stool in a Bijou bottle & transport to the laboratory within 2-3 hrsfor culture & microscopic examination. In case of delay transport media) like CaryBlair's medium/ V.R. fluid (especially if cholera is suspected) should be used (for use oftransport media, add about 1-2 gm of semi sold stool/liquid stool in 10 ml of transportmedia. It is preferable to keep, suspected cholera stool specimen at room temperaturetill it is transported to the designated laboratory. In practicality & during field situations,many times rectal swab are collected especially from infants and small children. 9.4.1 Rectal Swab lMoisten the rectal swab in inside rectum. and withdraw the swab. lPut the swab in any of the transport media like VR fluid / Cary Blair medium by inserting the swab completely into the media. lBreak off the excess wooden portion of swab stick and screw cap the bottle oftransport media. lStore at room temperature till transported to the nearest lab (if cholera issuspected) or else keep it in fridge (4 deg centigrade) if salmonella / shigellais suspected. lLabel the bottle of transport media. Vomitus is not a good specimen for collection, bed pan samples may be collected only if no other sample is available. For better isolation of pathogen there is no harm ifstool samples are collected in duplicate, one in plain bottle (for microscopy) & other intransport media.839.5 Transportation Two transport media, V.R. Fluid (for cholera) and Cary Blair's are commonly used for isolation of common bacterial enteropathogens like Salmonella, Shigella, and Eschcoli including Vibrios. If the specimens are collected in transport media like Cary Blair's, then it should reach nearby laboratory in 2-3 days time and samples can be kept atroom temperature. If rotavirus or any other viral etiology is suspected then stool specimencan be kept in fridge (4\u00b0C-8\u00b0C) - till it is transported to the nearby laboratory. 9.6 Stool examination9.6.1 Gross Note the colour, (yellow/green, black etc), consistency (watery/semi-formed), and presence of blood/mucus.and odour etc. Offensive odour in stool specimen is suggestiveof amoebic infections. Sometimes frank pus may be present in the stool specimen whichis suggestive of severe dysentery. 9.6.2 Microcopy This is a simple laboratory examination that yields meaningful information at low cost. One can not only see the presence of blood, mucus, parasites & their ova/cyst(ova also be observed. 9.6.2.1 Methods 9.6.2.2 Preparation of Lugol's Iodine Weigh Iodine crystal (powder form) : 5gm Potassium Iodide : 10gm Add Distilled water (d/w) : 100 ml Dilute the stain in d/w 1:5 before use. Potassium iodide is dissolved in distilled water and iodine crystals are slowly added. The solution is then filtered & kept in a stopper bottle of amber colour. Shelf life of this solution is 2 weeks. 9.6.2.3 Procedure lTake a drop of normal saline and a drop of Lugol's iodine with a nichrome wire loop and put it over a clean glass slide at 2 places. lTake a minute portion of semi-solid faeces with nichrome wire loop andmix it with 0.9% saline. Similarly mix small amount of faeces with Lugol'siodine too. In Iodine stained preparation - Iodine kills the organisms (somotility of trophozoite forms of Entamoeba histolytica if any is lost) aswell as iodine makes nuclear structure of amoeba stained, thereby making84it clearly visible. lMix the two with a wooden stick / toothpick so as to make an emulsion lPut a cover slip no 0 or 1 over the normal saline and Lugol's iodine, stool emulsion lFor examination of the slide, first a low power (10x) objective should beused followed by high power (40x) objective. lRecord the findings. 9.6.2.4 Precautions lWhile taking stool sample either for culture or microscopy select mucus or blood portion of it if present. lIf stool specimen is watery then there is no need to use normal saline formicroscopy - it may be examined directly lThe emulsion should be neither too thick nor thin & air bubble entrapmentshould be avoided. l Also there must not be excessive fluid while preparing the slides to preventcover slip overflowing over the emulsion. lWhile viewing normal saline preparation under microscope, condensershould be put down & diaphragm partially opened to control amount oflight passing through the slide. For visualizing darting motility of Vibriocholerae, diaphragm should be partially closed to reduce the amount oflight passing through the slide. lMotility of Entamoeba histolytica can be enhanced if normal saline usedis slightly warm & stage of microscope is kept warm by microscope bulb/table lamp. lUrine should not be allowed to mix with stool while collecting specimen. lRectal swab should be properly collected after putting it inside rectum sothat proper rectal swab is collected - and not mere anal swab. 9.6.2.5 Interpretation of Microscopy Following 1) Darting motility of cholerae2) V.cholerae and other enteropathogens 9.7 Stool culture Direct inoculation of onblood agar depending upon availability of various media, resources and experience. Enrichment culture lFollowing 5-6 hrs. enrichment in alkaline peptone water (APW )and 12-18 hrs. enrichment in Selenite-F broth, repeat culture is done to agar (XLD agar)are picked up with straight wire for further processing. lPreferably one should try to pick up single isolated colony as far as possible. Incase of doubt it is preferable to first sub-culture suspected NLF / Pink colonies -purify the isolate - before putting up biochemical tests. lThere are many biochemical tests like glucose, usuallyput up to a stool pathogen. However at the district levelsimple biochemical tests may be put up for preliminary characterization ofenterobacteriaceae that is glucose with durham's tube, lactose, triple sugar ironagar (TSI), ), Indole, urease and motility test.No hard and fast rule can be applied - however number of biochemical tests thatis required to be put up is ultimately determined by the experiences of the technicianand resources available. lFor further characterization of isolates including sero -typing, phage typing etc theisolate may be stocked on 1.5% nutrient agar slants and send to nearby state/central reference laboratories. lAntibiotic sensitivity of the isolate may be attempted at district laboratory or theisolate may be sent to reference labs. 9.7.1 Methods for enteropathogen isolation lSelect fresh culture plates (not older than 7 days). lDry culture plates at 37\u00b0C incubator for about half an hour. lUse single culture plates for one specimen in the beginning. Later on two specimens may be plated in one plate. lLabel all the plates. lTake little stool specimen (slight) with Nichrome wire loop & make a primarywell on to BSA, MacConkey's agar plate or XLD case may be. (ref. fig.9.14 ). lSterilize nichrome loop in blue portion of bunsen burner flame. Cool the loop. lHeat sterilize the loop & re-streak in parallel lines after cooling the loop so asto isolate separate single colonies as far as possible. l Also inoculate enrichment broth like selenite- F and APW after labeling thesame.87lIncubate at 37 \u00b0C incubator for 24 hrs. lNext day observe colony morphology on to various enriched/selective media plate. 9.7.2 Appearance of colonies for V. cholerae BSA Round, clearly translucent, oil drop like colonies suggestive of Vibrio cholerae. Sometimes one has to really hunt for cholera colonies if number of pathogenic bacteriaexcreted in stool is lesser or was destroyed due to improper collection / transportationof specimens. Sometimes samples are to be collected after patient has already startedsome empirical antibiotic treatment thereby leading to decrease in number ofenterpathogens. Even a single suspected vibrio colony is significant & should be saved,sub cultured & identified. In outbreak situations, agglutination with poly '01' choleraantisera & later specific cholera antiserum (ogawa/inaba)or 0139-Bengal may be usedto do slide agglutination test from solid culture plates (BSA). For further characterization,the representive isolates may be sent to designated reference laboratory. 9.7.3 Colonies on XLD: Look for pink colonies with black centres suggestive of Salmonella or Pink colonies without black centre suggestive of Shigella. Most Escherichia coloniesare seen as Colonies appearance on MacConkey's Agar Non-lactose fermenting, pale colonies with smooth consistency, either very minute suspected of shigella or slighly larger (1-2 mm) suspected of Salmonella sps. It is a goodpractice to carry out oxidase test for all types of NLF colonies so as to excludePseudomonas, Aeromonas. Pseudomonas and salmonella, shigella and E.Coli are oxidase negative. Any suspected Salmonella or Shigella colony should be subcultured on a Nutrient Agar Slope and subjected to biochemical tests for identification or sent to referencelaboratory. 9.8 Tests for identification of organism Biochemical Test9.8.1 Oxidase Test 9.8.1.1 Method oTake a piece of filter paper on a clean glass slide & add 1% freshly prepared oxidase reagent (tetra-methyl-para-phenylene diamine-di88hydrochloride-refer sec.7.18 for prep.). the filter paper at room temperature. oPick a speck of colony using glass rod/ platinium loop & rub it on the filter paper. Development of purple colour within 30 seconds is(fig.-9.13) indicative of positive oxidase reaction. Do not use Nichromewire for Oxidase Test. 9.9 After this the suspected V. Cholerae colony should be subjected to the following tests 9.9.1 Gram staining Refer to chapter no. 6 for Grams staining 9.9.2 Motility test of organism in liquid medium 9.9.2.1 Method lTake a clean glass slide & make a thin ring of plasticine (good quality of ISI make) & apply it over the slide. (refer to the Fig- 9.1). lThickness of the ring should not be more than 1mm, so that there is nodifficulty in focusing the slide with 40x high power objective. lTake a clean coverslip & put on small drop of liquid culture over thecoverslip with the help of a small sized inoculating loop (about 1mmdiameter). Fig.-9.1 lPut the slide containing plasticine ring over the coverslip containing thedrop of liquid culture without touching the drop and then invert the slideso that the drop hangs (see Fig 9.3). l Put the condenser low and focus the slide in low power (10x objective).And try to focus the edge of the drop. lExamine next in high power i.e. 40 X objective for checking the motilityagainst the stationary background (fig.-9.4) lMotility can also be checked by inoculation in soft agar mediumand observing the medium after 24 hrs incubation. (refer to theFig 9.1, 9.4).89 METHOD OF PREPARATION OF HANGING DROP (For motility checking) Fig 9.1 Fig : 9.2 Fig : 9.3 Fig: 9.4 9.10 Slide agglutination test for 9.10.1 Method oTake out cholera antisera from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature. oFor carrying out slide agglutination test take, 2-3 clean glass slides. oMake them grease free by cleaning with cotton & then passing over flame several times. Cool the slide.90oAll sera manipulation are to be done in an aseptic manner in clean area so as to prevent antisera contamination. oTake two drops of normal saline with Nichrome wire loop and put over a clean glass slide - side by side. oPick up a suspected colony with a straight wire and emulsify on to both the saline drops one by one. oCheck for autoagglutinability i.e. formation of coarse granules without the addition of antisera. oIn case of rough strain auto agglutinability will be observed. oIn such a case, no further serotyping should be attempted. In case the strain is smooth & forming a smooth suspension, add a drop (small) ofcholera antiserum (Poly O1). oLook for clumping i.e. formation of coarse granules which indicate agglutination. oIn case there is no agglutination with Poly 01 V. cholerae antisera, repeat the steps with 0139-Bengal antisera. oInform laboratory incharge for further necessary action or public heath measure in case cholera is diagnosed at district level laboratories.(Notification of cholera in the prescribed form) oIn case no agglutination is found with any of the cholera antisera as stated above, then the strain is stated as non-agglutinable vibrios andpreserved for further characterization. To optimise the use of V. cholerae antisera it is advisable to carry out sero typing in representative isolates of V. cholerae in an outbreak situation 9.11 Other Biochemical tests There are commonly two types of biochemical media available, one is liquid medium of sugar solutions (0.5 - 1.0 % carbohydrates added in peptone water base along withandrade's indicator) like glucose, lactose, sucrose, mannitol etc in test tubes i.e. sugartubes and other is solid i.e. in the form of slopes. Inoculation procedure for some ofthe commonly used biochemical tests is given below: Refer to the diagrams(Fig 9.5 to 9.8). For inoculation of glucose, lactose, sucrose, mannitol i.e. sugars take a single well isolated colony with a straight wire and inoculate by rubbing the wire on to the sidewall91of the tube after tilting it slightly so that the point of rubbing remains underneath the liquid. (refer the Fig 9.7 ) If liquid peptone water culture is available then a small dropmay be added in aseptic manner after flaming the neck of the sugar tubes.. For inoculationof slope media (solid ) like urea and citrate, inoculate a colony or peptone water culturein wavy manner over the slope (see Fig 9.8). For TSI and LIA media one has to inoculatein similar manner as stated above and in addition a stab should be made using astraight wire. (refer to the Fig 9.6).For TSI single stab is enough and for LIA two stabsare required. 9.11.1 Observations of biochemical tests following overnight incubation9.11.1.1 Glucose Pink colour with or without gas production in durham's tube is suggestive of positive test & indicates that glucose has been utilized/fermented. Similarly lactose, mannitol,sucrose etc. change colour to pink on fermentation of respective sugars.

Take a drop of 0.5% sodium desoxycholate on a clean glass slide. Then add a speck of culture with loop and lift the93loop. A string is formed if positive for cholera. (refer toFig.- 9.12). 9.12 Antibiotic Sensitivity testing Antibiotic sensitivity testing of the pathogenic isolates should be done by Kirby Bauer's technique using Mueller Hinton agar plate. Appropriate quality control strainlike E. Coli ATCC 25922 must be put up each time. Refer to the chapter 17 on antibioticsensitivity. 9.13 Good Lab Practice (GLP) lWhile taking rectal swab specimens, the swab made of absorbent cotton should be swirled into the rectum so as to have visible material on the swab. lSwab stick should be properly made with cotton so that while taking rectalswab cotton should not come out of the stick. lUse of freshly prepared dehydrated culture media is highly recommended.Only media less than one-week-old which is stored properly in fridge shouldbe used. lIt is a good practice to check growth supporting quality of various solid media(batch wise if possible) like XLD - agar, MacConkey's agar etc by inoculationof known lactose fermenter / and lactose non fermenter / ATCC Strains /known pathogens etc so as to do quality control check of dehydrated culturemedia. Also after preparation of media one of two plates should be incubatedat 37 degree centigrade so as to check sterility conditions. lDistilled water should always be used while preparation of media. lIn case cholera is suspected, stool / rectal swab specimens should not be keptin freezer (as is usually the practice for suspected shigella / salmonellagastroenteritis) - rather keeping such specimens at room temp is a better optiontill the specimens are processed or transported to the nearby referencelaboratory. 9.14 Quality control of media Every batch of media should be checked for sterility and growth supporting properties of ATCC and locally available pathogenic isolates from local laboratories.Similarly every biochemical test should be checked with known positive and negativecontrols.94 Table 9.1 Interpretation of Results S.

Hence all the results of stoolcultures should be clinically correlated for proper interpretation. 9.16 Biosafety Treat all stool specimens as potentially infectious material and observe proper handling procedure / biosafety procedure (refer to chapter on biosafety ).In short allused laboratory cultures like used tubes., media, bijou bottles, sugar tubes, plates needto be decontaminated (autoclaved ) prior to washing, sterilize and reuse.

These can be found in stools in their motile form (Trophozoites) or as cysts. Some intestinal protozoa arepathogenic, other are harmless. The motility of trophozoite forms is either because ofslow movement of the cell (Amoebae) or because of the presence of rapidly movingflagella or cillia. The common pathogenic human protozoa are as given below Entamoeba histolytica2) Giardia lamblia.3) Balantidium coli. 10.2 Helminths Helminthic infections cause a variety of clinical symptoms including abdominal cramps, fever, weight loss, vomiting, appendicitis etc. There are three groups of medicallyimportant helminths : i.e. Nematodes (round worms), cestodes (tape worms) andtrematodes (flukes). Helminthic infections are usually diagnosed by detecting eggs and larvae. Less frequently, infections are diagnosed by detecting adult worms (.e.g. Ascaris lumbricoidesand Enterobius vermicularis) or proglottids of adult worms (e.g. T. saginata and T.solium). The characteristics used to identify eggs of different helminths are the size, shape, colour, thickness of the egg shell and the other specific characteristics. 10.3 Examination of Stool Specimens For Parasites Collect at least a spoonful quantity of faeces in a clean, dry, preferably screw capped transparent container without preservatives and send to laboratoryimmediately taking the following precautions. \u00f0Never leave stool specimens exposed to air in containers without lids \u00f0Never accept stool specimens mixed with urine. \u00f0Never examine stool specimens without putting on gloves. \u00f0Always examine specimens with in 1-4 hours of collection. If several specimens are received at the same time, examine the liquid stools and those containingmucus or blood first, as they may contain motile amoeba.9710.4 Examination 10.4.1 Naked eye: To look for color, consistency, presence of blood or exudates. The color can be black (occult blood), brown, pale yellow (fat) or white (obstructive jaundice),The consistency can be formed (normal), soft formed or watery (diarrhoeic). The presenceof external blood or mucus, usually seen as streaks of red or white are indicative ofeither ulcerative colitis, schistosomiasis or amoebiasis. 10.4.2 examination of stool/ faeces in saline or iodine is useful for the following reasons: i.e. to detect motile trophozoites (salineppn) and \u00f0Select portion of stool when looking for trophozoites, specially the blood & mucus containing portion. 10.4.2.1 Materials & Reagents \u00f0Microscope. \u00f0Grease \u00f0Wooden applicators. 10.4.2.2 Method 1) Take a clean, dry glass slide and label it with the specimen number.2) Wear gloves3) Put a drop, each of normal saline and Lugol's Iodine on the middle of the either end of the slide. 4) Using an applicator stick, take a small portion (about 2-3 mm diameter) of stool as described earlier. 5) Mix the sample with the drop of normal saline.6) Using the same applicator, take a second similar portion of stool and mix it with the drop of lugol's Iodine solution. 7) Discard the applicator in a disinfectant solution. i.e. freshly prepared 1% sodium hypochlorite solution. 8) Place a cover slip on each drop taking care to avoid the formation of air bubbles. 9) Examine the preparation under the microscope. First, examine the saline preparation for trophozoites of protozoa and ova & larvae of helminths.98Reduce the amount of light using the condenser aperture or by lowering the condenser. Examine first using 10 x objective, starting at the top lefthand corner and gradually covering the whole of the area under coverslip for presence of ova and larvae. Now, switch to 40x objective andagain examine the whole area of cover slip for motile trophozoites. 10) Next, examine the Iodine stained preparation for the cysts of parasites using 40 x objective. (Addition of Iodine kills the organism and therefore motility of trophozoites is lost but it stains the nuclei and glycogen mass of the cyst / trophozoites). 11) Report the findings after looking for the characteristic morphology of different parasitic trophozoites/ cysts and helminthic ova as below.(Fig Fig: 10.1 Cysts of intestinal protoza of man(stained with of man. 1,2 and 4: Fertilised eggs samples for detection of parasites Stool samples may be sent to a specialized laboratory for the identification of rare parasites that are difficult to identify. In such cases, a preservative should be added tothe specimens. e.g. 10 % formaldehyde solution. \u00f0Put one part of stool sample into 3 parts of 10 % formaldehyde solution in water/ normal saline. \u00f0 Mix the stool thoroughly using a glass rod. \u00f0Screw cap the container tight. \u00f0This solution preserves ova, cysts and adult worms indefinitely 9910.6 Preparation of Lugol's iodine solution for wet mount 10.6.1 Requirements A) 0.5 % lugol's iodine solution ..... Soln A B) Acetic acid, 50% solution, diluted 1:1 with distilled water --- Soln B Prepare a 1:1 mixture of lugols Iodine solution and acetic acid solution (diluted as above). Dilute this mixture with 4 volumes of distilled waterand stir. 10.6.2 Preparation of solution 'A' (Lugol's Iodine 0.5 % ) Iodine -------------- 5 gms. Potassium Iodide -------------- 10 gms.Distilled water -------------- 300 ml. Measure 300 ml of distilled water in a cylinder. First, dissolve the potassium iodide in about 30ml of distilled water. Add the iodine and mix until dissolved. Add the remainderof the water, mix well and store in a brown bottle. Label the bottle along with the date. 10.6.3 Preparation of solution 'B' (Acetic Acid 50% solution) \u00f0Glacial acetic acid -------------------------- 100 ml. \u00f0Distilled water ---------------------------. q.s. 200 ml Mix the two in a bottle. Label the bottle along with the date. 10.7 Kato-Katz Technique (for helminthic prevalence in community) In order to find out the prevalence and intensity of helminthic infection, Kato Katz technique is used. 10.7.1 Materials and reagents 1. Kato-Katz kit The Kit containsi) A roll of nylon screen 80 mesh (20m) ii) 400 plastic templates with a hole of 6 mm on a 1.5 mm thick template, delivering 41.7 mg of faeces. iii) 400 plastic spatula.iv) A roll of Hydrophilic cellophane,34 \u00b5m thick (20m) These kits are available commercially 2. Microscopic slides3. Flat bottom jar with lid.1004. Forceps. 5. Toilet paper or absorbent tissue.6. Newspaper.7. Glycerol-malachite green solution or glycerol-methylene blue solution. is as green or methylene blue powder with a pestle in a clean,dry mortar, Weigh out 3 gm. Of the powder, pour it into a bottleand add distilled water to give 100ml. Seal and label the bottle: 3%aqueous malachite green or 3% aqueous methylene blue. Store in a cabinetaway from light. To prepare the solution: pour 1 ml of the 3% aqueous solution into a 250 ml. bottle. Add 100 ml. of glycerol and 100 ml. of distilled water andseal the bottle; mix thoroughly before use). 10.7.2 Methodology 1. Place a small amount of faecal material on a newspaper/scrap paper and press the small screen on top of the faecal material so that some of the faeceswill be sieved through the screen and accumulate on top of the screen. 2. Scrape the flat-sided spatula across the upper surface of the screen so that the sieved faeces accumulate on the spatula. 3. Place template with hole on the centre of a microscope slide and add faeces from the spatula so that the hole is completely filled. 4. Remove the template carefully from the slide so that the cylinder of faeces is left on the slide. 5. Cover the faecal material with the pre-soaked cellophane strip.6. Invert the microscope slide and firmly press the faecal sample against the hydrophilic cellophane strip on another microscope slide or on a smooth hardsurface such as a piece of tile. 7. Carefully remove slide by gently sliding it sideways to avoid separating the cellophane strip or lifting it off. Place the slide on the bench with the cellophaneupwards. Water evaporates while glycerol clears the faeces. 8. The smear should be examined in a systematic manner and the number of eggs of each species noted separately. 10.7.3 Quality control for microscopy 1. Quality control is insured to verify the consistency of the microscopic readings. For this one day before the survey is spent on evaluating the consistency of101egg counting among the laboratory technicians. A simple method consists of preparing 10 slides and comparing the reading of each slide by eachlaboratory technician with that of the quality manager. A discrepancy of5-10% for egg per slide count is normal, but if the discrepancy is larger, thetesting is not valid and reasons must be identified and corrected. If one of thetechnicians presents readings, which are consistently different to those of others,he/she should be excluded from the team. An accurate egg per slide count isparticularly important for the Kato-Katz technique for intensity assessment. 2. Besides this, on each day of the survey, one should read 10% of the slides of each technician without prior knowledge of the results independently. In thecase of the discrepancy of more then 10%, the slides should be discussed by thetwo readers. And then further slides may be examined to avoid repeated errors. 10.7.4 Advantage of Kato-Katz technique are as follows lIn Kato-Katz technique a specified quantity of stool is examined, in contrast to STH survey carried out by other methods, where the quantity of stool examinedmay vary in each slide/sample. Hence any other concentration method is notsuitable for comparison of worm load in the different community and furtheracross country estimation. lKato-Katz technique is better than other technique for viewing STH. 10.7.5 Community categories for community diagnosis Community Criteria for classification category % of children positive for worm % of children with heavy intensity infection I >70% 10% or more II 50-70% Less than 10% III Less than 50% Less than 10% 10.7.6 Community intervention for control of STH Community category Proposed intervention I High prevalence, Treatment 2-3 times a year targeted to all school-age High intensity children, IEC, improvement in sanitation, water supply and appropriate waste management II High prevalence, low Treatment targeted to all school-age children at least intensity once a year, IEC, supporting improvement in sanitation, and waste management III Low prevalence, Case management, IEC, improvement in sanitation, low intensity water supply and appropriate waste management102CHAPTER-11 LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF DIPHTHERIA Diphtheria is an acute bacterial infection of the upper respiratory tract especially in children. The disease begins with a sore throat and fever, followed by general malaise and swelling of the neck. The disease is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae,which is a gram positive, nonendospore forming pleomorphic rod. The dividing cellsare folded together to form V- and Y shaped figures resembling chinese letters. Presenceof polyphosphate metachromatic granules is a characteristic feature of this bacterium.With simple stains e.g. methylene blue, the bacilli often have a beaded or barredappearance. With Alberts stain, the metachromatic granules stand out purple blackagainst the green stained protoplasm. Characteristically, C. diphtheriae causes a typicalform of infection manifested by a greyish white membrane at the site of localization oforganisms. Though, the diagnosis of diphtheria is mainly clinical, laboratory is required to confirm the diagnosis, which is based on demonstration of the causative organism inthe lesion. A presumptive diagnosis can be made on the basis of demonstration of thebacilli in the affected lesion by microscopic examination only, however confirmation isonly done by the culture examination. 11.1 Collection and transportation of specimens In suspected cases, swabs should be taken both from the throat and nose by a trained personnel as per the procedure given below. 11.1.1 Material Required lSterile cotton swab sticks in test tube. lTongue depressor. lAdequate source of light. 11.1.2 Procedure lAsk the patient to open his mouth without putting out his tongue and to say Ahhh-----. lWhile the patient is saying Ahhhh--- press the outer two third of thetongue with the tongue depressor using the left hand, making the tonsilsand back of the throat visible. lIntroduce the swab with the right hand avoiding touching the tongue. lLocate the inflamed part of the throat which is red or white. lRub the swab firmly against the inflammed part, turning it round andcollect membrane, if present.103lIf nothing abnormal is seen, swab the tonsils, the fauces and the back of the soft palate. lCollect two swabs and immediately place the same in sterile test tubes. lSimilarly, collect nasal swabs in duplicate. lSpecimens should be transported and processed as soon as possiblepreferably within 48 hours. In case of delay store the samples at 2-8\u00b0C 11.2 Processing of swabs lIn the absence of culture facilities, streak this swab on Loefflers serum slope which can be used as a transport medium. If feasible, this mediumcan be prepared in the district laboratory itself as described in subsequentpages, Alternatively, it can be prepared and supplied by the statelaboratories. The inoculated transport media should be sent to state/regional labs for culture and other tests. lWith the second swab streak two clean glass slides using a rollingmovement to make sufficiently thick smears. lIf there is only one swab, it is mandatory to first inoculate the transportmedia and then prepare the smear to avoid contamination. 11.3 Staining of smears lIn all cases, stain one of the smear with gram stain as described in chapter -6. lIf gram stained smear shows morphology suggestive of C. diphtheriae,proceed to do Albert's staining (Refer to chapter - 6) which demonstratesthe presence or absence of metachromatic granules (Fig- 11.1). Alternatively both staining may be carried out simultaneously. These organisms have to be differentiated from commensal bacteria in throat called diptheroids which are thick and short in appearance and do not contain metachromaticgranules. These also do not exhibit chinese letter arrangement. These exhibit a stronggram positive reaction as compared to C.diphtheriae organisms which are weakly grampositive. C. Diphtheriae show pleomorphism. Fig- 11.1 Morphology of C.diphtheriae 10411.4 Reporting of results It could be one of the followings: \u00f0No C. diphtheriae like organism seen. \u00f0Morphologically suggestive of C.diphtheriae. 11.5 Quality assurance Quality control checks on stains and media are to be performed with known positive and negative organisms. Use Staphylococcus epidermidis as the negative control andknown C. diphtheriae as the positive control strain. 11.6 Other significant organisms isolated from throat Throat swabs contain a variety of microorganisms including saprophytic Nesseria sps, Neisseria meningitidis, which is a gram negative diplococcus, an important organismwhich could cause disease or be present in a carrier state. Haemophilus influenzae isanother important organism present in throat. Beta haemolytic streptococci,Staphylococcus aureus and candida sps. are also frequently encountered. Beta haemolyticstreptococcus is the most common cause of sore throat in children. 11.7 Important points about diagnosis of diphtheria \u00f0Diagnosis of diphtheria is a laboratory emergency and deserves utmost priority. \u00f0Mild cases of diphtheria resemble pharyngitis and a pseudomembrane may be lacking. \u00f0Diphtheria is no longer diagnosed easily on clinical grounds. \u00f0Even non-toxigenic strains of C.diphtheriae are important. These have the potential to cause invasive disease in some patients and also the potential toundergo lysogenic conversion to toxin producers in vivo leading to disease. \u00f0Specimen should be transported and processed as soon as possible. 11.8 Biosafety 1. All work on suspected C.diphtheriae isolates which is likely to generate aerosols must be perfomed in a safety cabinet or in an inoculation hood. 2. All other laboratory biosafety procedures as outlined earlier should be adhered to. 11. 9 Preparation of Loefflers Serum slope11.9.1 Requirements lSterile serum 100 ml. lGlucose -------------------------------- 1 gm.10511.9.2 Method lDissolve the glucose in the broth and sterilize by autoclaving at 120\u00b0C for 15-20 min. lAdd the glucose broth to the serum with sterile precautions, mix thoroughlyand distribute 2.5 ml amounts into sterile screw capped 6 ml bijou bottlesand apply the caps tightly. lFor inspissation / coagulation of the medium, lay the bottles on their sideon a tray, sloped slightly to prevent the medium running up to the cap/lid. Place the tray in a hot air oven. Raise the temperature slowly to 80\u00b0Cand maintain it for 2 hours, till the serum would be coagulated to ayellow white solid matter. lAllow the slopes to cool. They should have a moist surface and a smallamount of condensation water at the bottom. Properly capped againstdrying, they can be stored for long periods.106CHAPTER - 12 LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF PYOGENIC MENINGITIS Bacterial/pyogenic meningitis, an infection of the membranes (meninges) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Beyond the perinatal period, there are three principal organisms responsible Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) andHaemophilus age group and geographical location.The other less commonly involved agents are Staphylococci, Escherichia coli and Listeriamonocytogenes. Meningococcus is the commonest young adultsand responsible for outbreaks / epidemics of meningitis, whereas in extremes of age itis pneumococcus. H. influenzae causes meningitis exclusively in young children under 5years of age, the vast majority of infections being caused by sero group B. Likewise inour country, 'C' out of the 13 serogroups known. Following the establishment of nasopharyngealcolonisation, illness results once bacteria invades the mucosal defenses, thus accessingthe blood stream and eventually reaching the meninges and CSF . Early diagnosis ofmeningitis is very much essential to initiate appropriate intervention for the patient aswell as the community. 12.1 Laboratory diagnosis Mainly based on examination of the following clinical samples. 12.1.1 CSF for - Biochemistry for protein, sugar . - Microscopic examination and cytology . - Rapid antigen detection. - Culture. 12.1.2 Blood for culture Out of the above, examination of CSF is more informative and a much more sensitive investigation, and except for culture, all other tests on CSF can/ should beperformed in a district laboratory. 12.2 Collection of CSF lShould be collected by a physician / paediatrician or a specially trained nurse. lShould be collected preferably before antimicrobial therapy. lUsing all aseptic precautions, the sterile lumbar puncture needle is insertedbetween the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae to a depth of 4-5 cms. The stylet iswithdrawn to let the fluid flow freely.107lCollect 1-2ml of CSF each in 3 sterile screw capped containers (Bijou bottles) to be examined for Chemistry, Cytology and Microbiology respectively. lNever pipette CSF by mouth. lNever freeze or refrigerate the CSF in suspected pyogenic meningitis. lSend the CSF to laboratory as early as possible preferably within an hour. lIn case the CSF is to be sent for culture, keep it in incubator at 37oC or use a transport medium (Stuart's modified medium). 12.3 Stuart's Modified Medium lIs commercially available lIs supplied in 15-30 ml bottles containing 8ml solid medium. The bottles are filled with a mixture of air (90%) and carbon-dioxide (10%). 12.4 Method of Inoculation lUnscrew the cap of bottle lHolding the bottle as upright as possible, (to prevent the gas escaping), inoculate the whole surface of media with CSF using a sterile pasteur pipette. l Replace the cap immediately. Dispatch the bottle at ambient temperatureimmediately. 12.5 Examination of CSF12.5.1 Direct examination (Naked eye)12.5.1.1 Describe the appearance of the CSF i.e. clear and colourless CSF (normal in aseptic meningitis), or cloudy CSF (due to presence of cells as in pyogenicmeningitis ) 12.5.1.2 Clot formation Examine the CSF , 10 min after collection for the presence of clots. Normal CSF has no clots, but clots may be found in the following conditions: lPyogenic meningitis: (a large clot.). lTuberculous meningitis: single or numerous fine clots are formed. 12.6 Biochemical examination of CSF CSF should be examined for levels of glucose and protein. 12.6.1 Glucose lGlucose concentrations in the CSF are normally about 60% of those in the blood. i.e. 50-80 mg/dl.108lIn patients with pyogenic meningitis and tuberculous meningitis, the concentration of glucose in the CSF is markedly reduced. lAs the glucose in CSF is rapidly destroyed, once the fluid is collected, it isimportant to carry out the estimation as early as possible. In case ofdelay, the CSF should be preserved in fluoride/ oxalate bottles. l (Refer to chapter - 23 (section 23.4) for detailed procedure). 12.6.2 Protein The normal concentration of protein in the CSF is 15-45mg/dl. The protein concentration is increased in bacterial meningitis. 12.6.2.1 Determination of Protein concentration : Refer to Chapter 23 The normal concentration of protein in the CSF is 15-45 mg/dl. The protein concentration is increased in bacterial meningitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage andcerebral malaria. Table: 12.1 Characteristics findings on examination of CSF in different clinical conditions Disease/Condition Appearance of CSF Glucose level Protein level Leukocyte concentration Pyogenic meningitis Cloudy yellowish Viral meningitis Clear Normal Normal or 10-300 cells/cmm slightly raised mainly lymphocytes Cerebral malaria Slightly Cloudy Reduced Elevated Elevated mainly granulocytes 12.7 Microscopic Examination Of CSF includes 12.7.1 Cytology : Determination of the leukocyte number concentration 12.7.1.1 Material and Reagents lMicroscope lFuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber (if not available, an improved Neubauer counting chamber may be used) lPasteur pipette with rubber teat. lCoverslips (supplied with the counting chamber) lBottle, 2-5 ml. lTurk's solution (described below). Ppn of Turk's Solution Glacial acetic acid 4 ml Loeffler's methylene blue solution 10 drops109Distilled water q.s 200 ml Dissolve the glacial acetic acid in 100 ml of distilled water. Add the methylene blue solution and mix. Transfer the mixture to a 200 ml volumetric flask and make the volumeto 200 ml with distilled water. 12.7.1.2 Method 1. Cover the counting chamber with the coverslip supplied (Fig 12.2) 2. Gently mix the CSF and fill the chamber with the fluid (Fig 12.3) - Undiluted, if the CSF appears clear;- Diluted, if the CSF appears cloudy.Make a 1:20 dilution using 0.05 ml of the CSF and 0.95 ml of Turck'ssolution. Pipette into a small bottle and mix. 3. Leave the counting chamber on the bench for 5 minutes to allow the cells to settle. Place the chamber on the microscope stage. 4. Count the cells in 1 mm 3 of CSF , using the 10x objective. When reporting in SI units, report as \"number x 106/L\", the value does not change. Example: 150 cells per mm3 are reported as \"150 x Fig: 12.1 Fig: 12.2 Fig: 12.3 Fig: 12.4 Important: If undiluted CSF is used, examine the cells using the 40x objective to make sure the cells are leukocytes. If erythrocytes are present, make the count using the 40xobjective. 12.7.2 Examination of a stained smear for bacteria l Examination of a gram stained smear for bacteria causing meningitis. l Examination of a Ziehl-Neelsen smear for Gram stained smear \u00f0 Centrifuge the CSF for 20 minutes at 1500-2000 rpm. \u00f0 Prepare smear by placing 1-2 drops of sediment on a clean grease free glass slide, allowing drops to form one large drop. Do not spread fluid,nor use too heavy a concentration of sediment. \u00f0 Air dry the slide. \u00f0 Pass the slide quickly through a flame three times to fix the smear. Alternatively, fixation by methanol (95%) can also be done \u00f0 Do not heat fix the smear until completely dry. \u00f0 Stain the fixed smear by standard grams staining method as described earlier----chapter - 6 ) \u00f0 Examine the stained smear microscopically using a bright field condenser and an oil immersion lens N.

In our country it is caused mainly by Salmonella typhi and less frequently by Salmonella paratyphi 'A'. It manifests in the form of fever (step ladder rise) accompanied with other symptoms likeloss of appetite, pain abdomen and constipation etc. 13.1 Laboratory diagnosis is based on 1) Isolation of the causal organism from the blood,faeces or urine of the patient by culture examination. 2) Demonstration of anti-salmonella antibodies in the patients serum by a serological test, which can be either the age old conventional widal testor the recently introduced typhidot test 13.1.1 Blood culture Out of the many clinical samples that can be used for culture, blood culture is the most informative. Blood should be collected aseptically (ref. to chapter-4) in at least5-10 ml quantity by venepuncture preferably during the first 7-10 days of illness beforestarting chemotherapy and added to a blood culture bottle containing 50-100 ml bilesalt broth. Transport the inoculated broth as early as possible to the state laboratory forfurther processing. In case of delay, refrigerate the bottles. Alternatively, clot culture can be performed as given below. lCollect 5-10 ml of venous blood asceptically in a sterile screw capped container. lAllow blood to clot. lThe serum is removed with a sterile pasteur pipette for carrying out theserological test. lThe clotted blood can be broken either with sterile scissors or glass rodand inoculated into bile salt broth. lAlternatively, clot can be digested with sterile streptokinase solution (100units/ml) and then inoculated into bile salt broth as before. 13.1.1.1 Preparation of Bile salt broth The bile salt broth can be procured commercially in a dehydrated form or can be prepared in the laboratory as given below. - Nutrient Broth ------------------------- 1 litre- Bile salt (Sodium taurocholate)------- 5 gm.113Adjust the pH of the nutrient broth to 7.6 and dissolve the bile salt in it, autoclave for 15 minutes at 115\u00b0C, 10lbs pressure and distribute in 50-100 ml amount inpresterilised blood culture bottles. 13.1.2 Serological Tests There are two types of serological tests lRapid typhidot test lWidal Test. The kits are commercially available in our country and one should strictly follow the manufacturer's protocol. 13.1.2.1 Typhidot Test Recently, with the availability of typhidot test,a reasonably sensitive (>95%) and specific (85-90%) diagnosis of fever caused by Salmonella typhi can be made in a shorttime (within 1 hour of collecting the sample). The test can be performed using a singlesample of blood/serum. The test can be easily performed in a district laboratory withoutthe need of any sophisticated equipments. Invented in Malaysia, typhidot is a qualitativeantibody detection test designed for the rapid diagnosis of enteric (typhoid) fever. Thepresence of IgM and IgG antibodies made against a specific antigen on the outermembrane of salmonella typhi are detected by incubating nitrocellulose strips dottedwith the specific antigen protein with the patients sera and control sera. To visualise the antigen-antibody complex, the strips are simultaneously incubated with peroxidase-conjugated antihuman IgM & IgG upon addition of the chromogenicsubstrate, the results can be read visually. Positive reading is indicated by the bluecolour as intense or more intense than that of the positive control. Total assay time is 1hour. 13.1.2.1.1 Test Protocol13.1.2.1.2 Reagents and with the kit TYPHIDOT contains reagents and antigens dotted strips for detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to Salmonella typhi, inclusive of controls. Use of sterile disposablepipette tips is recommended. Do not use kit beyond expiration date and do not mixreagents from different batch numbers.114TYPHIDOT Contents 28 Tests 56 Tests Predotted antigen strips 56 Strips 112 Strips Samples diluent (A1) 15 ml 30 mlWashing buffer (10x) (A2) 10 ml 20 ml Prediluted anti-Human 7.3 ml 14.6 ml IgG *HRP (B2) 7.3 ml 14.6 mlColour reagents Substrate A (C1) 5.5 ml 11 ml Substrate B (C2) 15.5 ml 31 ml Positive control 60 ul 120 ulNegative control 60 ul 120 ul Worksheet 2 4 Note: Store kit at 2-8 0C.

The diluted washing buffer is sufficient for the entire kit. Store it separately at 2-8\u00b0C anduse when necessary. 10X (A2) Distilled water 1X10 ml 90 ml 100 ml Store in a clean bottle at 2-8\u00b0C 13.1.2.1.2.3.2 Colour Development Reagents Prepare 30 minutes before use. Substrate A (C1) and substrate B (C2) should be brought to room temperature before mixing. Avoid exposing these reagents to strong115light during incubation or storage. Based on the number of tests (including controls), add the recommended volume of substrate B into a reagent bottle of a flask coveredwith aluminium foil. Then add the recommended volume of substrate A and mix well, asgiven below: No. of test (including 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 controls Substrate A (in ml) 0.25 0.5 0.75 1 1.25 1.5 1.75 2 2.25 2.5Substrate B (in ml) 1.25 2.5 3.75 5 6.25 7.5 8.75 10 11.25 12.5 13.1.2.1.3 Procedure 1) Divide the reaction tray into columns. Mark one column as 'M' and another column as 'G'. 2) Using forceps, remove the predotted antigen strips and place them with the marked slide up onto a filter paper. Align all antigen strips with the markedside on your right. Using a ball-point pen, for each serum sample, label onestrip as M and other as G. Perform similarly for positive and negative controls. Note : Make sure that there is an IgM and an IgG strips (2 strips) for each patient or control serum. 3) Add 250 ul of sample diluent into the appropriate 'M' and 'G' reaction wells. Place the 'M' or 'G' strips into the appropriate reaction wells. Shake traygently to allow strips to be thoroughly wet. 4) To the appropriate 'M' or 'G' reaction well, add 2.5 ul of either control or test serum to achieve a final serum dilution of 1:100. Gently aspirate the solutionsto mix. To avoid cross-contamination, use a new sterile disposable piptette tipfor each specimen. Make sure all membranes are with the marked side up,fully immersed in the first antibody solution. 5) Incubate at room temperature on a rocker platform (optional) for 20 minutes. Shake the tray gently, every 5-10 minutes if a rocker platform is not available. 6) Aspirate the first antibody solution into a discard jar containing a disinfectant. Add 250 \u00b5l of prepared washing buffer into each well and wash 3 times,each for five minutes. 7) Using sterile micropipettes tips, add 250 ul of prediluted anti-Human IgM (B1) into the 'M' well and 250 \u00b5l of prediluted anti-Human IgG (B2) into the 'G'well. 8) Cover the tray with aluminium foil and incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature (min 23 0C) on a rocker platform.1169) Aspirate the 2nd antibody solution and wash 3 times for 15 minutes as described previously in step '6'. 10) Add 250 \u00b5l of the colour development solution into each well. Cover the tray and incubator on the rocker platform. 11) Allow 15 minutes for colour development.12) Stop the reaction by aspirating the solution and briefly rinsing the strips in distilled water (3times). 13) Place similarly coded strips for IgM and IgG for each patient and test control onto filter paper to dry. Interpret the results. (see guided interpretation charts).If interpretation cannot be done immediately, store the strips submerged indistilled water for up to 1 day. 14) After use, rinse the tray thoroughly with distilled water. Store dry for re-use.15) For a permanent record, paste the dried membranes in the relevant position on the worksheet provided. 13.1.2.1.4 Interpretation13.1.2.1.4.1 Basic Principles To interpret the typhidot the colour intensity of the dots produced by the test sera must be equivalent to or greater than those of the positive control. Reading typhidotresult depends entirely on your observation of the intensity of each dotted antigens aftercolour development. There are few very important principles to remember. Always compare each IgM test with that of the positive IgM control strip. Similarly, compare the IgG test strips with that of the IgG positive control strips. lWhen comparing colour intensity, compare the dot on the left of the teststrips with the dot on the left of the positive control. Similarly, comparethe colour intensity on the right of the strips (next to the line marked onthe strips) with the colour intensity of the dot on the right of the positivecontrol strip. Only when both dots on the test strips are as dark as or aredarker than their corresponding dots on the positive control strips, theresult is reported as POSITIVE (fig.-13.1). lIf one of the dots on the test strips is lighter compared to the correspondingdot on the positive control strips, the result should be reported asnegative.117lIf you are not sure i.e. borderline cases, ask for the repeat serum specimen one or two days later. Figure - 13.1 SAMPLES RESULTS INTERPRETATION Positive controlsSample 1. POSITIVE Sample 2. NEGATIVE Sample 3. INCONCLUSIVE READ AS NEGATIVE. Sample 4. INCONCLUSIVE READ AS NEGATIVE Note: The strips should have a white background with only 2 dots appearing where applicable. The test should be repeated under the following conditions a) If the strips show a blue background making interpretations difficult. b) If the colour intensity of the negative control is similar to that of the positive control. c) If the colour intensity of the test serum is high but not equal to the positive control. (Request for a second serum specimen at least 2 days later so that ahigher serum titer would be available for detection). 13.1.2.1.4.2 Results and clinical interpretation Possible results and their clinical interpretation include: Result Clinical interpretation IgM positive only Acute enteric fever IgM and IgG positive Acute enteric fever (in the middle stage of infection) IgG positive Implications for the presence of IgG antibodies include previous infection (in which case currentfever may not be due to typhoid), or relapse orre-infection, therefore it is important thatinterpretation be made together with clinicalsymptoms. IgM and IgG negative Probably not enteric fever.118Limitation: when using typhidot, high IgG concentration may give false negative for IgM because specific IgG will drastically reduce binding of specific IgM tothe antigen. We strongly recommend that in cases where Typhidot is IgGpositive only, the test should be repeated using Typhidot-M to check for presenceof specific IgM to Salmonella typhi. Tyhidot-M is a 3-hour dot EIA test in whichthe patients's serum is inactivated with a special reagent before the test iscarried out for IgM detection In case of nonavailability of typhidot test, widal test can also be performed in a district laboratory as given below. 13.1.3 Widal Test For Diagnosis of Enteric Fever (Typhoid And Paratyphoid) Widal test is an agglutination test for detection of antibodies against Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, the common causal agents of enteric fever. 13.1.3.1 Principle When serum sample containing antibodies against S.typhi and S.paratyphi A and B are mixed with respective antigens, agglutination will take place. In S.typhi and S.paratyphi A and B, two types of antigens are recognized as diagnostically important: antigen or 'Flagellar' antigen.'O' antigens of various species have components in common and hence only one 'O' antigen i.e. that of S.typhi is employed: the 'H' antigen of Salmonella spp. arespecies specific, and the antigens of all three, viz S.typhi, S.paratyphi A andS.paratyphi B, are employed in the test. Commercial test kits for widal test are availablein India, and using them both quantitative and qualitative tests can be put up on suspectedsera samples. 13.1.3.2 Material and reagents Test kit contains the following reagents and materials Reagent 1: S.typhi ('H') - 4: S.paratyphi B ('H') - 5 mlReagent 5: S.Positive control - 1 mlGlass slide - 1 NoProduct Insert - 1 No11913.1.3.3 Materials required, but not supplied in the kit Small, dry and clean glass tubes (For quantitative tube test)Normal saline solutionWater bathMicropipette / dropper 13.1.3.4 Specimen Fresh serum (patient) free from contamination should be used. In case of delay in testing, store the sera samples at 2-8\u00b0C in a refrigerator. Note: lSpecimen is used undiluted. lDo not use haemolysed specimen. lDo not heat inactivate the specimen. 13.1.3.5 Test procedure13.1.3.5.1 Qualitative slide test for screening lClean the glass slide provided and wipe it dry. lPlace a drop of undiluted serum sample to be tested in each of the first four circles. lAdd one drop of Reagent-1, Reagent-2, Reagent-3, and Reagent-4, onto the specimen drop in circles 1-4 respectively. lMix the contents of each circle with separate mixing stick, and spread themixture to cover the whole circle. lRock the slide gently for 1 minute. lRead the result at the end of one minute. 13.1.3.5.1.1 Interpretation A positive reaction shows agglutination, visible to naked eye, in the respective circle. Then proceed for quantitative slide test or quantitative tube test for the appropriateantigen. 13.1.3.5.2 Quantitative slide test lClean the glass slide supplied in the kit and proceed as follows:120Circle Serum Appropriate Titre No. volume antigen 1. 0.08 ml 1 drop 1:202. 0.04 ml 1 drop 1:403. 0.02 ml 1 drop 1:804. 0.01 ml 1 drop 1:1605. 0.005 ml 1 drop 1:320 lMix the contents of each circle, starting with circle 5 and through circle- 1, wiping the mixing stick clean between circles. lRotate the slide for one minute and observe for agglutination. 13.1.3.5.2.1 Interpretation Titre of the serum is the highest dilution of the serum giving a positive reaction. 13.1.3.5.3 Quantitative tube test lTake a set of 8 clean glass tubes, per specimen, per antigen. lPrepare dilutions of serum specimen and add appropriate antigen as below: TUBE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 (discard 1ml) Appropriate- 1 drop 1 drop 1 drop 1 drop 1 drop 1 drop 1 drop 1 drop antigen l Mix well and incubate at 37\u00b0C for 16-20 hr, and observe for agglutination. lRepeat steps (ii) and (iii) as shown in the table, with all antigens which showed agglutination in the screening test. lNote the highest dilution showing clearly visible agglutination with naked eye.'O' antigen shows agglutination (matt).'H' antigen shows floccular 1:160 is suggestive of infection. (These titres would depend upon prevalence of antibodies in the local population, and if possible,data about base-line titres should be generated and one should not go according tomanufacturer's instructions). 13.1.3.6 Factors affecting Widal test13.1.3.6.1 Effect of antibiotic administration There is evidence that early treatment with antibiotics suppresses the antibody response by suppressing the multiplication of organisms. This may result in a low titre inwidal test. 13.1.3.6.2 Effect of past infection or typhoid vaccination lIt hes been seen that the 'H' antibodies persist for a long time upto many years after typhoid vaccination. Also, many years after recovering from enteric fever,any gram-negative bacterial infection can trigger a Salmonella 'H' antibodyproduction, thereby giving a false positive result in widal test. lCross reaction of 'O' antigen with other enteropathogens such as proteusspecies. 13.1.3.6.3 Time of collection of blood sample This is a very important parameter affecting the results of the widal test. A single blood sample collected during the first week of the illness may give a negative widal testresult, whereas in the same patient, a sample collected during the second or third weekof illness may show a very high titre. Accordingly, paired samples should be collected;the first sample being taken as early as possible and the second, 10-14 days later, foroptimum results.122CHAPTER - 14 MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF SPUTUM SPECIMENS FOR ACID FAST BACILLI (AFB) Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is an acid fast bacillus(AFB). The highest priority for tuberculosis (T.B.) control is the identification and cure of infectious cases. i.e. patients with sputum smear positive pulmonary T.B. The highestpriority in the diagnosis of T.B. is thus given to sputum microscopy. Acid fast bacilli areapproximately 1-10 \u00b5m bacilli which may be curved or bent.These may be granular, isolated, in pairs or in groups. Stained bacilli may present abeaded appearance. Diagnosis of pulmonary T.B. by sputum microscopy is simple, easy, inexpensive, rapid, technically not very demanding and more reliable than x-ray examination. Thepurpose of the sputum microscopy is two fold (a) Diagnosis of the patients with infectioustuberculosis (b) Monitoring the progress of treatment. For diagnosis, 3 sputumexaminations are performed (Spot, Morning, Spot) and for follow up 2 sputumexaminations (morning, spot) are performed. 14.1 Collection Of Sputum Samples lSelect a good wide- mouthed sputum container, which is disposable, made of clear thin plastic, unbreakable and leak proof material. lInstruct the patient to inhale deeply 2-3 times, cough up deeply from the chestand spit in the sputum container by bringing it closer to the mouth. lMake sure the sputum sample is of good quality. A good sputum sample isthick, purulent and sufficient in amount (at least 2-3 ml). 14.2 Storage And Transportation Of Specimens If the specimen is collected in the field and can not be immediately processed, it should be transported to the laboratory within 3-4 days of collection. The specimenshould be collected in the containers meant for the purpose and lid tightly secured,properly labelled and to be kept away from the sun and heat. These can be placed in aspecial box, which can withstand leakage of contents, shocks and other conditionsincident to ordinary handling practices. These boxes should be kept in the cool conditionsand then transported to the laboratory. 14.3 Ziehl Neelsen --- 0.1% 14.3.3 Method lSelect a new, unscratched slide and label the slide with a laboratory serial number. lMake a smear from yellow purulent portion of the sputum using the jaggedend side of a bamboo stick. A good smear is spread evenly, 2cms x 3cmsin size and is neither too thick nor too thin. The optimum thickness of thesmear can be assessed by placing the smear on a printed matter, theprint should be just readable through the smear. air-dry for 15-30 mins. lFix by passing slide over the flame 3-5 times for 3-4 secondseach time. lPlace the fixed slide on the staining rack with the smeared side facingupwards. lPour filtered 1% carbol fuchsin over the slide so as to cover the entireslide. Do not leave the carbol fuchsin on the slide for a long time (notmore than 5 mins.) lHeat the slide underneath until vapours start rising. Do not let carbolfuchsin to boil or the slide to dry. Continue the process up to five minutes. lAllow the slide to cool for 5-7 minutes. lGently rinse the slide with tap water to remove the excess carbol fuchsinstain. At this point, the smear on the slide looks red in colour. lDecolour the stained slide by pouring 25% sulphuric acid on the slideand leaving the acid for 2-4 mins. lLightly wash away the free stain. Tip the slide to drain off the water. lIf the slide is still red, reapply sulphuric acid for 1-3 mins, and rinsegently with tap water. lCounter stain the slide by pouring 0.1% methylene blue solution on toslide and let it stand for one min. lGently rinse the slide with the tap water and tip the slide to drain off thewater.124lPlace the slide in the slide tray and allow it to dry. lExamine the slide under the microscope using 40 x objectives to select the suitable area of the slide and examine under the 100 x lenses usinga drop of immersion oil for the characteristic acid fast bacilli as shown infigure (14.1). At least 100 oil immersion fields should be examined beforedeclaring a smear as negative. In case of the scanty result, examineanother 100 oil immersion fields. 14.3.4 Grading Of Smears Record the result in laboratory form and laboratory register appropriately as per table given below: Examination findings Result Grading Minimum No of fields to be examined More than 10 AFB per oil Positive 3+ 20 immersion fields1-10 immersion fields number seenNo AFB per 100 oil immersion fields Negative 0 100 Fig.-14.1 14.4 Safety Precautions lTreat all sputum samples as potentially infectious and use leak proof containers for collection and transportation of the samples. lUse bacteriological safety hood while carrying out all procedures involvingsputum and always wear mask. lDisinfect the sputum cups/ incineration, 1-2% freshly prepared hypochlorite solution, which ever isfeasible and then disposed off. Clump of AFB seen in a sputum smear.(Ziehl-Neelsen stain. examined at \u00d7 1000.)125lWash hands with soap and water frequently especially after touching the sputum. lDo not eat, drink or smoke in the laboratory area. lClean laboratory bench tops with a disinfectant (Phenol or hypochlorite solution)at the end of each day 14.5 Quality Control: To check the quality of staining reagents as well as the procedure, the following should be followed at least once a week lMake a smear from H37Rv strain of Ziehl Neelsen method. lUse this smear as a positive control (all the bacilli in the smear should bebright pink coloured). lMake a smear from the growth of staphylococcus aureus. lStain the smear by Ziehl Neelsen method. lUse this smear as a negative control (all the bacteria in this smear should beblue coloured).126CHAPTER - 15 COLLECTION, TRANSPORT AND STORAGE OF CLINICAL SPECIMENS FOR VIRUS ISOLATION The demand for virus identification has greatly increased in recent years. Development in virology and refinements in identification techniques have introducedviral studies into many new laboratories. Quality laboratory examination of specimensfor virus isolation and identification begins with the selection of patients for viral studies The choice of specimen to be collected for diagnostic approaches, especially of viral origin, depends upon the nature of the symptoms of the patient and of thepathogenesis of suspected viral agent. The symptoms indicate the involvement of entiresystem and help in taking specimens. For example, throat swabs, nasopharyngealswabs are required in upper respiratory tract infection, cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) forinfection of central nervous system, and so on. When clinical symptoms are not clear, anumber of samples namely faeces, urine, blood etc. have to be collected for virusisolation.

There are four stages of syphilis infection: primary, secondary, latent and tertiary, and a special condition of maternal-fetaltransmission termed as congenital syphilis. Immune responses to syphilis can be groupedinto non-specific (or reaginic) and specific. The non-specific reagin is of the IgM class and reacts with an alcoholic extract of beef heart known as cardiolipin (a phospholipid). Since, the reaginic antibody lacksspecificity, it shows up in many other conditions and disease states unrelated to treponemalinfection. In these cases false-positive reactions can occur. Specific antibodies totreponemes (both to T.pallidum and to nonpathogenic treponemes) of the normal bacterialflora of the oral or genital tract can also develop. These antibodies are of the IgG classand remain detectable throughout the life of the patient despite treatment. Routine testsfor syphilis include the Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) of syphilis The RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test is a non-treponemal test for serological diagnosis of syphilis. It is a reliable, economical, reproducible and rapid test which is easy to readwithout the help of a microscope. The specificity and sensitivity of the test are similar tothose of VDRL test, the sensitivity being 85-90% in primary disease, 100% in secondary,90-95% in latent disease and 75% in late or tertiary stage. 16.1.1.1 Principle of test The RPR test has replaced the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, as a rapid screening test for the following reasons: lThere is no need for daily preparation of reagents. lNo microscope is required. lHeat inactivation of serum is not required. The RPR test uses the VDRL antigen modified with choline chloride to inactivate complement, and charcoal particles to allow the results of the reaction to be read withouta microscope. The RPR test can also be applied as a semi-quantitative test. RPR antigen suspension is a carbon coated non-treponemal cardiolipid antigen, which detects reaginic antibodies present in serum/plasma of patients suffering fromtreponemal infections. These antibodies may be occasionally found in sera of personswith other non treponemal conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, Kala-azar,132etc. When a specimen contains antibody, flocculation occurs due to co-agglutination of the carbon particles of the RPR antigen, which appear as black clumps against the whitebackground of the card, which is read with the naked eye. 16.1.1.2 Test Procedure Follow the instruction of manual provided with test kits. Briefly the procedure is as follows: lPlace one drop of serum or plasma (50 ul) on the card with the help of adropper. lAfter thoroughly mixing RPR antigen suspension, place one drop(15-20ul) of the same alongside the drop of plasma on the card. lMix these drops well and spread out the pool of liquid uniformly withinthe entire area of the circle by using the applicator stick provided with thekit. lRock the card gently to and fro for 4 minutes and observe under a goodlight source for clumps. lUse appropriate positive and negative controls provided with the kit. 16.1.1.3 Interpretation of test result Positive result Black aggregates which are deposited at the periphery of the liquid within 4-5 minutes. Negative result Complete absence of black aggregates with a uniform grayish background at the end of 4-5 minutes. 16.1.2 Rapid Specific Test For Syphilis A rapid visual test for the qualitative detection of antibodies to Treponema pallidum (TP) in human serum / plasma is available, which is specific to T.pallidum. 16.1.2.1 Principle It is a one step immunoassay for the detection of TP antibodies in serum or plasma. The syphilis antigen is immobilized on the nitrocellulose strip in a thin line. After a serumor plasma specimen is added to the sample pad, it flows laterally through an absorbentpad where it mixes with the antigen-colloidal gold conjugate. Ifthe antibodies to Treponema pallidum are present in the sample, the antibodies willbind the colloidal gold-antigen conjugate forming an through the nitrocellulose strip by capillary actionwhere it meets the immobilized antigen (test line) forming an antigen-antibody-antigen133colloidal gold complex. This forms a pink band indicating the sample is reactive for antibodies to Treponema pallidum. If antibodies to are absent, theTreponema pallidum antigen colloidal gold conjugate flows past the test line & no pinkband is formed at the test line. To serve as a procedural control an additional line ofanti-mouse antibody (control line) has been immobilized at a distance above the testline on the strip. If the test is performed correctly, this will result in the formation of a pinkband upon contact with conjugate. 16.1.2.2 Storage & shelf life Should be stored at 4-8\u00b0C in the coolest & driest area available. It has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing. Do not freeze. It must be protected fromexposure to humidity. Test strips should be used within one hour after removal from theplastic container. Plastic container containing strips should be tightly capped 16.1.2.3 Precautions lFor in vitro diagnostic use only. lHandle all specimens as though they contain infectious agents. When the assay procedure is completed, dispose off specimen after autoclaving forat least 30 minutes at 121\u00b0C. Alternatively, it can be treated with 0.5 %sodium hypochlorite for 1 hour before disposal. lAvoid repeated freezing and thawing of the sample to be tested. lFor best results, follow the given test procedure and storage instructionsstrictly. lDo not use this product after the expiry. lClean & disinfect all spills of specimens using a suitable disinfectant, suchas 0.5% sodium hypochlorite. lDo not freeze the product. lDo not open the zip lock foil pouch to remove the product until it attainsroom temperature and you are ready to perform the assay. lTightly zip seal the foil pouch after taking out required strips from thecylinder so that strips are protected from moisture. 16.1.2.4 Warning for user DO NOT 1) Do not dip in human serum / plasma sample above the green line mark as the conjugate may dissolve into sample instead of migrating up.1342) Do not immerse holding end absorption pad in the serum / plasma sample. 3) Do not keep the strip under (a) working fan (b) heavy air circulation (c) table lamp bulb (b) high ambient temperature. DO 1) Interpret the result at the end of 20 minutes only. 2) Take out the strip from the plastic container just before performing the test to avoid denaturation of the strips due to atmospheric exposure. 16.1.2.5 Specimen collection & storage a) Patient sample performs best when tested immediately after collection. Fresh clear serum or plasma only may be used for testing. Do not use haemolysed,contaminated or lipemic sample for testing. b) If not tested immediately, specimen should be refrigerated at 2-8\u00b0C for upto 3 days following collection or at -20\u00b0C if testing within 3 days is not possible. c) Specimen containing visible precipitates or cloudy specimen may give inconsistent test result. Such specimen should be clarified prior to testing byhigh speed centrifugation i.e. 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes before testing. d) Bring specimen to room temperature (25-30\u00b0C) prior to testing. Frozen specimens must be completely thawed & mixed well prior to testing. Specimenshould not be frozen & thawed repeatedly. 16.1.2.6 Test procedure 1) Bring the specimen & zip lock pouch containing the strips to room temperature prior to testing. 2) Remove the required number of strips from plastic container. 3) Pipette 0.2ml of the specimen directly to the bottom of the labeled test tube. Avoid wetting of the inside walls of the test tube, as drops on the walls of thetest tube may risk the test by wetting the strips above the filter area. 4) Hold the strip from the printed end and dip into the tube so that the end (as indicated by the arrows) contacts the specimen upto the green line mark. Thefluid level of specimen must not be higher than the line indicated by the arrows. 5) Let the strip remain dipped in the sample. Allow the reaction to occur for 20 minutes. 6) At the end of 20 minutes take out the strip from the sample tube and read the test results.135 7) Discard the strip immediately after reading the results as it is potentially infectious Fig: 16.1 Rapid Specific Test for Syphilis Any change beyond the prescribed testing time (20 minutes) is of no diagnostic significance Important: Do not dip the strip beyond the green line mark. 16.1.2.7 Interpretation of result16.1.2.7.1 Reactive If two distinct pink lines are formed, one near the dipping end and other near the holding end, the test should be interpreted as reactive (as shown in Fig.16.1(1). Adifference of intensity in colour may occur between the test line and control line dependingon the concentration of the antibodies in the specimen, but this does not affect theinterpretation of the result. 16.1.2.7.2 Non Reactive If only one distinct pink line is formed near the holding end of the strip (control line, as shown in fig. 16.1(2) the specimen is non-reactive. Interpret sample as non-reactive. 16.1.2.7.3 Invalid If neither control line nor test line shows up (as shown in fig.16.1(3)) the test is considered to be invalid. This may be because of the following reasons. 1. If the strip is not immersed in correct direction.2. If the specimen level is above the arrow mark of the strip.3. If the conjugate is not migrating up at all.4. If the specimen is not clear or is turbid. In case of invalid result, the test should be repeated using a new strip and fresh sample. 13616.1.2.8 Limitations of the procedure 1. The test is for in vitro diagnostic use only.2. The test should be used for the detection of TP antibodies in serum or plasma only and not in other body fluids. 3. The test will only indicate the presence or absence of TP antibodies in the specimen and should not be used as the sole criteria for the diagnosis ofTP infection. 4. As with all diagnostic tests, all results must be interpreted together with other clinical information available to the physician. 5. Additional follow up testing using available clinical methods (along with repeat test) is required, if the test is negative with persisting clinicalsymptoms. 6. This is only a screening test. All reactive samples should be confirmed by confirmation test. Therefore, for a definitive diagnosis, the patient's clinicalhistory, symptomatology as well as serological data should be considered.The results should be reported only after complying with above procedure. 16.2 Tests for hepatitis virus infection Routine tests for hepatitis include the use of markers for hepatitis A, B and C viruses. Hepatitis A is most common in children, especially in nurseries; however, it is not routinelytested for, except in cases of epidemics. Hepatitis B and C viruses are transmitted through blood products, body fluids, contaminated needles and other contaminated materials. Hepatitis B virus has several markers which include: a surface antigen (HBsAg) b. antibody to surface antigen (anti-HBs) c. envelope antigen (HBeAg)d. antibody to envelope antigen (anti-HBe) e. antibody to core antigen (anti-HBc) The concentrations of these markers vary during the course of an infection. The antigen markers appear first or earlier on exposure to the virus. Sero-conversion (antibody production) often occurs several weeks or months after exposure. Hepatitis testing is routinely done by solid-phase ELISA and radioimmunoassay methods. Commercial kits for detection of hepatitis markers are available and specific137criteria and instructions are provided with each kit. 16.2.1 Diagnosis of Hepatitis B Viral Infection Diagnosis of Hepatitis B viral Infection is very important, not only in case of viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis patients, but also in the screening of donor blood samples,to ensure safe blood transfusion and to control or check the spread of hepatitis B infectionthrough unsafe blood transfusion. This is achieved by detection / demonstration of\"Hepatitis-B surface Antigen\" (HBsAg; the 'Australia Antigen') in the patient/ donorblood samples A simple latex agglutination test for rapid detection of HBsAg, which is very much feasible in the laboratories, is described below: 16.2.1.1 Latex Aggutination Test For Rapid Detection Of HBsAg 16.2.1.1.1 Principle A distinct agglutination occurs, when serum sample containing HBsAg is mixed with latex particles coated with purified and highly reactive anti-HBsAg antibodies;there would be no agglutination when the serum sample does not contain HBsAg. 16.2.1.1.2 Materials and reagents Commercial kits for this test are available in India. They contain the following reagents and accessories. Reagents 1: HBsAg latex reagents - 1 vial Reagents 2: Positive control serum - 1 vial Reagents 3: Negative control serum - 1 vial Accessories: Disposable plastic slides Disposable applicator sticksDisposable plastic droppersRubber teats. All the reagents are stable and active, till the expiry date mentioned, provided they are stored in a refrigerator at 2-8\u00b0C. Do not freeze the reagents. 16.2.1.1.3 Specimen lThe test is performed on serum separated from the patient's/ donor's blood. lDo not heat inactivate the test or the control sera samples. lIf delay in testing, store test serum samples in a refrigerator or deepfreezer, taking care to avoid repeated freezing and thawing of thespecimens.13816.2.1.1.4 Test procedure lAllow the reagents to attain room temperature, and shake the vials gently to make sure that the latex reagent is completely in suspension. lPlace one drop (50 \u00b5L) of undiluted serum in one of the circles on theslide. More circles to be filled if more than one test sera samples are to betested. Use separate droppers for each specimen. lAdd one drop (50 \u00b5L) of latex reagent on to each specimen drop incircles, using a disposable dropper. lMix the content of each circle, using separate disposable applicator sticksfor each circle, and spread the mixture uniformly over the entire area ofthe circle. lRock the slide gently, to and fro, for 5minutes, and watch for agglutination. 16.2.1.1.5 Precautions 1) To avoid contamination of reagents, make sure that the cap of each vial is properly and promptly applied to the same vial. Interchanging of capsand droppers lead to contamination and erroneous results. 2) Improper mixing and interchange of applicator sticks also lead to erroneous result 3) Vigourous rocking of slides may lead to impaired agglutination. 16.2.1.1.6 Interpretation lVisible agglutination in < 5 lNo --- HBsAg Negative 16.2.1.1.7 Limitations lProbability of FALSE POSITIVITY = 1% of all samples, due to presence of other antigens. (Rheumatoid Factor). lFALSE NEGATIVE results may be encountered with specimens containingvery high titers of HBsAg (Prozone effect). In such cases the characteristicsyndrome (Severe jaundice, GPT/GOT elevation) will be apparent. Inthat case repeat the test after diluting the specimens 1:40, with normalsaline. 16.2.1.1.8 Quality control Positive and negative controls should be put up simultaneously as quality control measures.13916.2.1.2 Dipstick Test For Hepatitis B Surface Antigen 16.2.1.2.1 Principle The dipstick test for the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) takes advantage of the formation of a visible spot by precipitating immunocomplexes. Conjugates of monoclonal antibodies against HBsAg coupled to colloidal gold particles are adsorbed to one area of a nitrocellulose strip (zone A in Fig.1) Polyclonal antibodies against HBsAg are chemically fixed to another area of the strip, zone B. A drop of human serum is applied to zone A. The HBsAg antigen in theserum binds to the antibody conjugate and the gold-HBsAg immunocomplex migratesalong the strip until it reaches the fixed polyclonal antibodies in zone B. The polyclonalantibodies precipitate the gold-HBsAg immunocomplex, and form a visible red band inzone B. No red band is formed if the serum does not contain HBsAg. 16.2.1.2.2 Materials and reagents lCommercially available test kit containing dipsticks, reagents and controls. 16.2.1.2.3 Method a. Label the test strip with the patient's name and/or number.b. Add a drop of serum to zone A as recommended by the manufacturer.c. Allow the serum fluid to migrate to zone B on the test strip.d. Inspect zone B after 10-20 minutes for the appearance of a spot indicating a positive reaction. 16.2.2 Rapid Test For Hepatitis C Virus Antibody Various rapid tests are currently available for detection of antibody to HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) in blood. We describe here an immunochromatic test (ICT) which has consistentresults in various laboratories in recent past. It is a simple test for qualitative detection ofantibodies to HCV in human plasma or serum. 16.2.2.1 Principle HCV recombinant and synthetic peptide antigens are spotted on the membrane of the filter device. Antibodies to HCV in the serum or plasma bind with them. A proceduralcontrol is included in the form of spot or line of anti human immunoglobulin. HCVantibodies are visualized by reacting with conjugate. Appearance of two lines or spots,control and test indicate a positive test.14016.2.2.2 Components of Kit lAntigen coated device lConjugate - Gold/colloidal gold protein A. lWashing solution (ready to use). lPositive and negative controls. 16.2.2.3 Precautions while handling kits and reagents lDo not use kits or reagents beyond the expiration date. lDo not mix reagents from different lots. lUse all reagents (either as neat or reconstituted) strictly according to the instructions in the kit insert. lDo not pipette by mouth. lTake appropriate biosafety measure while handling the specimens, kitsand reagents. 16.2.2.4 Storage lStore kits as per the instructions on the kit. lBring the kit and its components to room temperature before use. 16.2.2.5 Test Procedure 16.2.2.5.1 Pre-assay preparations 16.2.2.5.1.1 Work bench preparation lSpread filter paper sheets on the workbench. lKeep a breadbox filled 1/4th with disinfectant (1% sodium hypochlorite) for disposing tips, vials, reagent bottles etc. lKeep a biohazard bag ready for disposing dry waste. lKeep disinfectant (70% alcohol) swabs ready in a closed container. lKeep all accessories required for testing (micropipettes-single channel,marker pen, stop watch, thermometer) ready on the table. lKeep sample deposition plan with kit details, proforma, and protocol onworkbench. 16.2.2.5.2 Reagents lBring all specimens and reagents to room temperature (20-30\u00b0C). lImmediately after use put back the reagents at 2-8\u00b0C lDo not freeze reagents.14116.2.2.5.3 Assay procedure 16.2.2.5.3.1 Preparation of test samples lUse plasma or serum as specimens. lDo not use heat inactivated samples. 16.2.2.5.3.2 Preparation of reagents lBring all the reagents to room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before testing if these test kits have been stored in refrigeration.

Susceptibility testing is indicated for any organism that contributes to an infectious process warranting antimicrobial chemotherapy. The test is specially indicated when the causative organism is thought to belong to a species capable of exhibiting resistanceto commonly used antimicrobial agents. A variety of laboratory methods can be used to measure the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents. An agar disk diffusion method is commonly usedfor testing common, rapidly growing and certain fastidious bacterial pathogens. Themethod involves placing filter paper disks impregnated with specific antimicrobial agentson agar plates pre seeded with the organism to be tested and judging the degree ofsensitivity by the size of zone of inhibition resulting after overnight incubation. Thereare many methods of disc diffusion test, the most commonly used method is modifiedKirby Bauer method also recommended by NCCLS (National Committee of ClinicalLaboratory Standards) 17.1 Selection of the antibiotic discs Selection of the most appropriate antimicrobial agent to test and report a given microorganism is best made by each clinical laboratory in consultation with the practicingphysician. However, NCCLS recommended list of antibiotics based on the organismisolated is annexed (Table: 17.1) To minimize confusion all antimicrobial agents should be reported using official nonproprietary (Generic) names. 17.2 Material/reagents required 17.2.1Mueller-Hinton (M-H) agar Of the many media available, NCCLS recommends the use of muellor hinton agar for the routine susceptibility testing of non fastidious bacteria. Note: The recommended medium for testing S. pneumoniae and is agar 1) M-H agar can be prepared from a commercially available dehydrated base according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The PH should be between 7.2 and 7.4 at room temperature. 17.3 Antimicrobial discs Antimicrobial discs to be used for the drug sensitivity test can be obtained commercially or can be prepared in the laboratory. 17.3.1 Preparation of discs 1) Take whatman filter paper No.1, punch discs of 6mm diameter with the help of a punching machine. 2) Dispense the discs in a screw capped glass bottle and sterilize by dry heat in a hot air oven at 140\u00b0C for 60 minutes. 17.3.2 Preparation of antimicrobial solution The antimicrobical solution is prepared depending upon the number of discs required and the amount of antimicrobial needed per disc. (Potency of the disc) Tables 17.3 - 17.6 depict the concentration of different drugs per disc. To exemplify, if we require 100 discs of kanamycin with antibiotic content of each disc being 30\u00b5g,then the method shall be as follows : a) Amount of drug required for 100 discs = 30\u00b5g x 100= 3000\u00b5g or 3mgm. b) Accordingly, dissolve 3mgm of kanamycin powder in 1ml of sterile distilled water. c) Take a sterile petri dish and spread the discs in the petri dish at a distance of around 2mm from each other. d) Take a sterile syringe fitted with a needle that delivers 100 drops of solution per ml when syringe and needle are held vertically. e) Drop a single drop of antibiotic solution on each disc.f) Let the discs dry and store in a sterile container at 2-8\u00b0C.14717.4 Turbidity standards for inoculum preparation To standardize the bacterial inoculum for the susceptibility test, a BaSO4 turbidity standard equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard or its optical equivalent should beused. Macfarland standard may be prepared as per the procedure given below. Preparation of McFarland Nephelometer Standards Principle A chemical induced precipitation reaction can be used to approximate the turbidity ofa bacterial suspension. Method lSet up 10 test tubes or ampoules of equal size and of good quality. Use new tubes that have been thoroughly cleaned and rinsed. lPrepare 1% chemically pure sulfuric 2 H2O) lSlowly, and with constant agitation, add the designated amounts of the twosolutions to the tubes as shown in table 17.2 to make a total of 10 ml per tube. lSeal the tubes or ampoules. The suspended barium sulfate precipitatecorresponds approximate to homogenous E. coli cell densities per milliliterthroughout the range of standards as shown in table. lStore the McFarland standard tubes in the dark at room temperature. Theyshould be stable for 6 months.

If large particlesappear, the standard should be replaced. 17.5 Other minor requirements are lFine forceps lWire loop / pasteur Spirit Procedure for disk diffusion test17.6.1 Inoculum preparation 17.6.1.1 Growth Method 1) At least 3-5 isolated colonies of the same morphology are selected from an agar plate culture. The top of each colony is touched with a wire loop andgrowth transferred into a tube containing 4-5 ml of suitable broth (peptonewater/ nutrient broth/ trypticase Soy broth.) 2) The broth culture is incubated at 35-37\u00b0C for 4-6 hours or till it achieves or exceeds the turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard 3) The turbidity of the broth culture can be adjusted using either sterile normal saline or sterile broth to match that of 0.5 McFarland. This results in a suspensioncontaining approximately 1-2 x 10 8 CFU/ml of E. coli. 17.6.1.2 Direct colony suspension method As a convenient alternative, the inoculum can be prepared by making a direct broth or saline suspension of isolated colonies selected from a 18 to 24 hours agargrowth. The suspension is adjusted to match the 0.5 Mc Farland turbidity standard. 17.6.2 Inoculation of test plates 1) Optimally, within 15 minutes after adjusting the turbidity of the inoculum suspension, a sterile cotton swab is dipped into the adjusted suspension. Theswab should be rotated several times and pressed firmly on the inside wall ofthe tube above the fluid level to remove excess inoculum from the swab. 2) The dried surface of a Mueller Hinton agar plate is inoculated by streaking the swab over the entire agar surface. The procedure is repeated by streaking 2or more times, rotating the plate 60\u00b0 each time to ensure an even distributionof inoculum. Finally, the rim of the agar plate is swabbed. 3) The lid may be left ajar for 3 to 5 minutes but not more than 15 minutes to allow for any excess surface moisture to be absorbed before applying thedrug impregnated discs. Note :- Extremes in inoculum density must be avoided. Never use undiluted overnight brothcultures.14917.6.3 Application of discs to inoculated plates 1) The predetermined battery of discs for a particular isolate are taken out of the refrigerator and brought to room temperature. Thereafter, discs are placedindividually using the fine sterile forceps or with a dispensing apparatus onthe inoculated agar plate. The discs should be distributed evenly so that theyare no closer than 24 mm from center to center. No more than 12 discs shouldbe placed on a 150 mm plate or more than 5 discs on a 100 mm plate. 2) The plates are inverted and placed in an incubator set to 35-37\u00b0C within 15 minutes after the discs are applied. 17.7 Reading plates and interpretation of results After 16 to 18 hours of incubation, each plate is examined. There should be a confluent lawn of growth along with uniform circular zone of inhibition. lZones are measured to the nearest whole millimeter using a graduatingscale held in back of the inverted petri plate. The petri plate is held a fewinches above a black non-reflecting background and illuminated withreflected light. lThe zone margin should be taken as the area showing no obvious, visiblegrowth that can be detected with the unaided eye. Faint growth of tinycolonies, which can be detected only with a magnifying lens at the edgeof the zone should be ignored. However, discreet colonies growing within a clear zone of inhibition should be sub cultured, reidentified andretested. lThe sizes of the zones of inhibition are interpreted by referring totables17.3-17.6 and the organisms are reported as either susceptible,intermediate susceptible or resistant to the agents tested. 17.8 Quality Control To control the precision and accuracy of the dics diffusion test, a set of standard bacterial strains as given below should be tested alongside the test cultures on a regularbasis (once a week at least or when ever new batch of culture media and discs are used) l Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. These strains obtained from Institute of microbial technology, Chandigarh. NICD, Delhi can also supply the same on request. 17.8.1 Storing quality control strains For prolonged storage, stock cultures may be maintained at -20\u00b0C or below in a150deep freezer suspended in a suitable medium. e.g. 10 to 15 % glycerol in tryptic soy broth, or alternatively in a freeze dried state. Working cultures should be stored onnutrient agar/tryptic soy agar slopes at 2-8\u00b0C and subcultured weekly. New workingcultures should be prepared at least monthly from the frozen / freeze dried stock cultures. lBefore testing the strains should be subcultured on to agar plates to obtainisolated colonies. lThe quality control strains should be tested by the standard disc diffusion testusing the same materials and methods as for the test isolates. lAcceptable zone diameters for different strains are listed in tables 17.3 - 17.6.

Collect a blood sample as soon as possible after the onset of illness, hospital155admission or attendance at a clinic (This is called the acute serum, S1) Collect a second blood sample shortly before discharge from the hospital or, in the event of a fatality, at the time of death (convalescent serum, S2) Collect a third blood sample, in the event hospital discharge occurs within 1-2 days of the subsidence of fever 7-21 days after the acute serum was drawn (lateconvalescent serum, S3). The optimal interval between the acute (S1) and the convalescent (S2 or S3) serum is 10 days. The above recommendations allow for the collection of at least two serumsamples for comparison, and ideally will provide for an adequate interval betweensera. Serological diagnosis are predicted on the identification of changes in antibodylevels over time. Serial (paired) specimens are required to confirm or refute a diagnosisof acute flavivirus or dengue infection. 18.3.1 Blood collection in tubes or vials and transportation Aseptically collect 2-10 ml of venous blood. Use adhesive tape marked with pencil, indelible ink, or a typewritten self adhesive label to identify the container. The name of the patient, identification number and dateof collection must be indicated on the label. Use vacuum tubes or vials with screw caps, if possible. Fix the cap with adhesive tape, wax or other sealing material to prevent leakage during transport. Transport specimens to the laboratory in an ice box as soon as possible. Do not freeze whole blood, as haemolysis may interfere with serology test results. If there is more than a 24-hour delay before specimens can be submitted to the laboratory, the serum should be separated from the red blood cells and stored frozen. 18.3.2 Collection of samples for isolation of Dengue virus for transportation to referral laboratory Clinical specimen for isolation of dengue virus diagnosis can be accomplished in a majority of cases provided the same is taken in the first few days of illness and processedwithout delay. Specimens that may be suitable for virus isolation include:(1) Acute phase serum; (2) plasma; (3) washed buffy coat from the patient; (4) autopsy tissues from fatal cases especially liver, spleen, lymph nodes and thymus, and(5)mosquitoes collected in nature. These samples should be immediately transported (within 48 hours) to referral laboratory in an ice box. 18.4 Laboratory Diagnosis Serological tests carried out for diagnosis of dengue are: 1. Dengue IgM ELISA test 2. Dengue IgM & IgG Rapid Strip Test15618.4.1 Dengue IgM ELISA Test (Commercial Kit) The Kits are commercially available and the manufacturer's instructions as per kit insert should be strictly adhered to. 18.4.1.1 Principle The qualitative immunoenzymatic determination of IgM-class antibodies against Dengue virus is based on the ELISA (Enzyme- linked Immunosorbent assay) technique.Microtiter strip wells are precoated with Dengue virus antigen to bind correspondingantibodies of the specimen. After washing the wells to remove all unbound sample materialhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) labelled anti-human IgM This conjugatebinds to the captured Dengue virus-specific antibodies. The immune complex formed bythe bound conjugate is visualized by adding tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate whichgives a blue reaction product. The intensity of this product is proportional to the amountof Dengue virus-specific IgM antibodies in the specimen, sulphuric acid is added to stopthe reaction. This produces a yellow endpoint color. absorbance at 450 nm is readusing an ELISA microwell plate reader. 18.4.1.2 Materials and Equipment required \u00d8ELISA microwell plate reader, equipped for the measurement of absorbance at 450/62Onm \u00d8Incubator 37\u00b0C \u00d8Manual or automatic equipment for rinsing wells \u00d8Pipettes to deliver volumes between 10 and 1000\u00b5l \u00d8Vortex tube mixer \u00d8Deionised or (freshly) distilled \u00d8Timer 18.4.1.3 Materials and Reagents 12 breakapart 8-well snap-off strips coated with Dengue Virus antigen type 2; vacuum sealed, in resealable aluminium \u00d8IgM sample diluent \u00d8Stop solution. \u00d8Washing virus anti-IgM conjugate. \u00d8TMB substrate solution \u00d8Dengue virus IgM positive control \u00d8Dengue virus IgM negative control \u00d8Strip holder \u00d82 Cover foils15718.4.1.4 Stability and Storage The reagents are stable up to the expiry date stated on the label when stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C. 18.4.1.5 Reagent Preparation It is very important to bring all reagents, samples and controls to room temperature (20 to 25\u00b0C) before starting the test run. \u00d8Coated removable well strips The ready to use breakapart snap-off strips are coated with dengue virus antigen.

Dispense 10\u00b5l sample and 1 ml IgM sample diluent into tubes to obtain a1:100 dilution and thoroughly mix with a Vortex. Positive and negative controlsare ready to use and must not be be diluted. (ii) Test Performance Please read the test protocol carefully before performing the assay. Result reliability depends on strict adherence to the test protocol as described. Prior tocommencing the assay, the distribution and identification plan for all specimensand controls should be carefully established on the protocol sheet. Select therequired number of microtiter strips or wells and insert them into the holder. \u00d8Please allocate at least 1 well for the substrate blank, 2 wells for the negative control and 1 well for the positive control. It is recommended to test controls and patient samples in duplicate. \u00d8Perform all assay steps in the order given and without any appreciable delays between the steps. A clean, disposable tip should be used for dispensing eachcontrol and sample. Adjust the incubator to 37\u00b0 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. \u00d8Methodology 1. Dispense l00ml controls and diluted samples into their respective wells. Leave one well for substrate blank. 2. Cover wells with the foil supplied in the kit. 3. Incubate for 1 hour \u00b1 5 min at 37\u00b0C. 4. When incubation has been completed, remove the foil, aspirate the content of the wells and wash each well three times with 300\u00b5l of washing solution. Avoidoverflows from the reaction wells. The soak time between each wash cycleshould be >5 sec. At the end carefully remove remaining fluid by tapping stripson tissue paper prior to the next step!159Note: Washing is critical. Insufficient washing results in poor precision and falsely elevated absorbance values. 5. Dispense l00\u00b5l Dengue virus anti-IgM conjugate into all wells except for the blank well. Cover with foil. 6. Incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Do not expose to direct sunlight.7. Repeat step 4.8. Dispense l00\u00b5l TMB substrate solution into all wells.9. Incubate for exactly 15 min at room temperature in the dark.10.Dispense 100\u00b5l stop solution into all wells in the same order and at the same rate as for the TMB substrate solution. Any blue color developed during theincubation turns into yellow. Note: Highly positive patient samples can cause dark precipitates of the chromogen. These precipitates have an influence when reading the optical density. Predilutionof the sample with physiological sodium chloride solution, for example 1 : 1, isrecommended. Then dilute the sample 1 : 100 with dilution buffer and multiplythe results by 2. 11.Measure the absorbance of the specimen at 450/620 nm within 30 min after addition of the Stop Solution. \u00d8Measurement Adjust the ELISA Microwell Plate Reader to zero using the substrate blank well.If - due to technical reasons - the ELISA reader cannot be adjusted to zero usingthe substrate blank well then subtract the absorbance value of substrate blankwell from all other absorbance values measured in order to obtain reliable results.Measure the absorbance of all wells at 450 nm and record the absorbancevalues for each control and patient sample in the distribution and identificationplan.Dual wavelength reading using 620 nm as reference wavelength isrecommended. Where applicable calculate the mean absorbance values of allduplicates. 18.4.1.7 Results \u00d8Run Validation Criteria In order for an assay to be considered valid, the following criteria must be met: Substrate blank : Absorbance value lower than 0.100.Negative control: Absorbance value lower than 0.300. Positive control : Absorbance value equal to or greater than the cut-off value. \u00d8Calculation of Results The cut-off is calculated by addition of 0.35 absorbance units to the measuredabsorption of the mean value of the two negative control determinations.16018.4.1.8 Interpretation of Results Samples are considered positive if the absorbance value is higher than 10% over the cut-off. Samples with an absorbance value of 10% above or below the cut-off should not be considered as clearly positive or negative \u00e0 grey zone It is recommended to repeat the test again 2 - 4 weeks later with a fresh sample. If results in the second test are again in the grey zone the sample has to be considerednegative. Samples are considered negative if the absorbance value is lower than 10% below the cut-off. 18.4.2 Dengue IgM & IgG Rapid Strip Test (Commercially available)18.4.2.1 Principle Serum antibodies of the IgM or IgG class, when present, bind to anti-human IgM or IgG immobilized in two lines across the test strip. Colloidal gold-labeled anti-flavivirusmonoclonal forms complexes with the dengue antigen that is captured by dengue specificIgM or IgG in the patient's serum. These complexes are visualised as pink/purple line (s). 18.4.2.2 Precautions 1. All human blood products should be handled as potentially infectious material. 2. Never pipette by mouth or allow reagents or patient sample to come into contact with skin. 3. Optimal results will be obtained by strict adherence to this protocol. Reagents must be added carefully to maintain precision and accuracy. 4. Care should be exercised to protect the reagents in the kit from contamination. Do not use if evidence of microbial contamination or precipitation is present. 5. The test should be performed on serum only. The use of whole blood, plasma or other specimen matrix has not been established. 6. Icteric or lipemic sera, or sera exhibiting haemolysis or microbial growth should not be used. 7. Do not heat inactivate sera.8. Do not use reagents beyond the stated expiry date marked on the package label. Keep storage boxes dry. 9. Do not reuse test strips. Do not use test strips if foil pouch is damaged.10. Testing materials should be disposed of in accordance with local, state and/or federal regulations. 18.4.2.3 Storage and Shelf life of Reagents Store kit between 2 0C and 80C.

Performing the assay outside the time and temperature rangesprovided may produce invalid results. Assays not falling within the establishedtime and temperature ranges must be repeated. \u00d8Steps 1. A single glass or plastic tube is required for each sample to be tested.2. Add 3 drops (75 \u00b5l) of buffer to each tube. Ensure that the buffer bottle is held vertically when dispensing. 3. Using the loop provided, add 1\u00b5l of serum to the tube.4. Gently shake the tube to ensure adequate mixing of the serum in the strip buffer. 5. Remove the test strip from the pouch just prior to use.6. Add the test strip to the tube containing diluted serum. Ensure that the red label coloured end marked \"SAMPLE\" is placed into the tube. 7. Read the results 15 minutes after adding the test strip. Any trace of a pink/ purple line in the test area indicates a positive result. If a pink line has notdeveloped after 15 minutes, read the strip again after 30 minutes as somevery weak results may require 30 minutes to develop. 8. The absence of a test band suggests a negative result. In some strips, a negative result may appear as a white \"ghost' line if the background is palepink. 9. The assay to be considered valid, the control line must appear. If it does not appear, the test must be repeated.16218.4.2.7 Expected values and test limitations Primary dengue is characterised by the presence of detectable IgM antibodies 3-5 days after the onset of infection. Secondary dengue is characterised by the elevation ofspecific IgG 1-2 days after the onset of infection and in the majority of cases this isgenerally accompanied by an elevation of IgM. 18.4.2.8 Interpretation of results 1. IgM and Control Positive. The test is positive for IgM and is indicative of a primary dengue infection. 2. IgM, IgG and Control Positive. The test is positive for IgM and IgG antibodies and is indicative of a secondary dengue infection. 3. IgG and control positive. The test is positive for IgG antibody and is indicative of secondary dengue infection. 4. Control positive. No detectable IgG and IgM antibodies to dengue. The result does not exclude dengue infection. Retest in 3 - 4 days if dengueinfection is suspected.163 CHAPTER-19 LABORATORY PROCEDURES FOR DIAGNOSIS OF JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a zoonotic viral disease caused by group B arbovirus (flavivirus), involving the Central Nervous System. In nature, the virus is maintained in animal and birds, particularly pigs and ardied birds (e.g. cattle egrets, pond heronsetc.). Although infection in human is incidental, the virus can cause serious neurologicaldisease in human. The disease occurs with sudden onset and the common symptomsare headache, high fever, stiff neck, abnormal movements (coarse tremor, convulsionsin children), impaired consciousness and coma. Case fatality rate in JE is high, rangingfrom 20-50%. 19.1 Case definition 19.1.1 Suspect case \u00d8High grade fever of acute onset with at least two of the following: \u00d8Decrease in level of consciousness independent of convulsions \u00d8Significant change in mental status either in behaviour or personality \u00d8Convulsions 19.1.2 Probable case \u00d8Suspected case of Japanese encephalitis, and \u00d8Usually not more than a few cases (1-2) in one village \u00d8Presence of animal hosts and high density of vector 19.1.3 Confirmed case \u00d8Presence of IgM antibody in serum. \u00d84 fold rise in IgG antibody titre in paired sera collected at 14 days interval. 19.2 Laboratory diagnosis of JE Laboratory diagnosis of JE is done by following methods:19.2.1 Detection of antigen/isolation of virus (i) Demonstration of viral antigen in the autopsied brain tissue by the fluorescent antibody test (ii) Isolation and identification of the virus from CSF , occasionally from peripheral blood (within 3 to 4 days after onset of symptoms) or autopsied brain tissue. 19.2.2 Detection of antibody The detection of antibodies to JE virus can be done routinely by haemagglutination164Inhibition Test (HI) test, IgM Capture ELISA test. The antigen and reagents for both the tests are available from National Institute of Virology, Pune. The above tests cannot be performed at district laboratories. Hence the samples should be collected and properly stored and transported to referral laboratory for furtherprocessing. For details of collection, storage and transportation refer to chapter '4'. 19.3 Laboratories undertaking work on JE in India 1. National Institute of Virology, Ambedkar Road, Pune 2.

Across the tropics three different diseases are caused by various species of genus Leishmania. These Kala azar is the major public health problem. It is endemic in Bihar, West Bengal and eastern Uttar Pradesh. The disease is transmittedby the bite of infected female sand fly of the genus Phlebotomus. There is no zoonoticreservoir. Man is the only reservoir of infection for Kala azar in India. The averageincubation period of disease is 3 - 6 months. Patient presents with symptoms of fever,malaise, weight loss, anorexia, cough and diarrhoea. Liver and spleen are enlarged. Inuntreated patients, death ensures in as many as 90% cases which is usually attributed tothe concomitant infections. The diagnosis of Kala-azar comprises of demonstration or isolation of the parasite from blood or biopsy material and demonstration of leishmania specific antibodies inthe serum. 20.1 Collection, storage and transportation of specimen The collection, transportation and storage of specimens are extremely vital steps in laboratory diagnosis of any disease and hence, must be undertaken with utmost care.The following general rules should be observed while collecting these specimens: lCollect sufficient quantity of specimen. lAvoid contamination by using sterile equipment and aseptic precautions. lDispatch the specimen immediately to laboratory. lIn case the delay is inevitable, keep the specimen at 4\u00b0C in a refrigerator. Label all specimens accurately and send all pertinent information to laboratory which will help in better interpretation of the laboratory findings. The following specimens need to be collected: lBlood lBiopsy/aspirate from bone marrow and/or spleen. 20.1.1 Blood It can be collected either through a venipuncture or by finger prick method.16620.1.1.1 By Venipuncture Method : See detail procedure in chapter 4 lCollect blood in a plain clean vial and allow it to clot at room temperature. lTake specimen to the laboratory promptly. If there is a delay, store in refrigerator at +4\u00b0C. lSeparate serum in a clean test tube with the collected serum for 5 mts. lCollect supernatant in another screw capped bottle or storage vial. lStore at + 4\u00b0C or at - 20\u00b0C till used. 20.1.1.2 By Finger Prick method : See detail procedure in chapter 4 lPrint 20 mm diameter rings on Whatman No 3 filter paper strips. lPrick the finger using aseptic technique and soak the circles completely with the oozing blood. lAllow the strip to dry at room temperature. lWrap the strip in polythene cover and store either at + 4\u00b0C or at - 20\u00b0C. 20.1.2 Bone Marrow Aspirate Bone Marrow Aspirate should be collected by a qualified clinician using all asceptic precautions. It can be collected from:- lMid-sternal region, a little away from the middle line and at the level of secondor third intercostal space. lPosterior iliac crest puncture, 1 cm below the posterior superior iliac spine. 20.1.2.1 Material Required Sternal puncture needle:- A short stout needle of the lumbar puncture type, provided with a stylet and a movable guard. The latter is adjusted at a distance of 1.5 to 2 cmfrom the tip according to the distance required by the needle to reach the marrow andtherefore varies with the thickness of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the thoracicwall. The needle is introduced with the stylet in position. One 2 ml glass syringe for injecting xylocaine and one 10 ml syringe for taking the marrow. 2% solution of xylocaine.Spirit, Tr. iodine, Tr. benzoin co. Glass slides & culture bottle (Tobie's medium). 20.1.2.3 Procedure lAsk the patient to lie on his back in the supine position. lPaint the area with 1% Tr. Iodine. Clean with spirit wait for 30 sec. lInject local anaesthesia (xylocaine) upto periosteum. lWait for 5 minutes.167lMake a puncture by piercing through the skin and subcutaneous tissue upto the periosteum. When marrow cavity is reached, a loss of resistance is felt. lTake out stylet and fit a 10 ml glass syringe (dry and sterilised). lAspirate about 0.25 to 0.75 ml of the marrow fluid by gentle suction. lWithdraw the syringe along with sterile puncture needle. lSeal the wound with Tr. Benzoin co. lInoculate 2-3 drops of aspirate in culture bottle and transport to laboratoryimmediately. lEject one drop on glass slide for making smear. Make 2-3 such smears. 20.1.3 Spleen Puncture When spleen is considerably enlarged it is one of the valuable method for establishing the parasitological diagnosis of kala-azar. However, there is a risk of bleedingand it should be carried out in a hospital setting with suitable precautions under thesupervision of clinician. 20.1.3.1 Material Required lA 5 ml glass syringe having a 26 number needle. An absolutely dry sterile syringe is essential as water causes lysis of the parasite. lCotton wool bandage, Tr. Iodine, alcohol, Tr. Benzoin Co. lGlass slides & culture bottles (Tobie's medium). 20.1.3.2 Procedure lAsk the patient to lie on his back. lApply spirit and Tr. iodine to the area 1/2\" to 1\" below the costal margin on left side. lAsk the patient to hold his breath. lIntroduce first the sterilised needle into the skin and then directly into the spleen. lAspirate and withdraw the needle quickly. lSeal the area with Tr. benzoin Co. lApply an abdominal bandage with pressure pad on the splenic area. lInoculate 2-3 drops of the aspirate in culture bottle and transport to laboratoryimmediately. lEject a drop on glass slide for making a smear. Make 2-3 such smears. 20.2 Smear examination The conclusive evidence in the diagnosis of Kala azar is the demonstration of the parasite. The amastigote forms of the parasite i.e. Leishman donovan bodies (LD bodies)can be demonstrated in stained smears of bone marrow splenic aspirate and rarily inthe lymph node aspirate smears. Because of the small number of parasite present in the168peripheral blood it is difficult to demonstrate the parasite in the peripheral blood smears. The highest positivity rate is in splenic aspirate followed by bone marrow aspirate. 20.2.1 Giemsa stain Please refer to chapter No.9 for of stain. 20.2.2 Procedure of staining20.2.2.1 Giemsa staining lClean glass slide lPut drop of marrow/splenic aspirate on the slide lDraw a thin smear on the slide and air dry lDilute Giemsa stain by adding 1 drop to each 1 ml of neutral or faintly alkaline (pH 7 - 7.2) distilled water. lPour diluted stain over the film (about 5 ml/film is required) and keep for 30to 45 minutes lThen flush the slide in a gentle flow of tap water. Keep the slide in an uprightposition to drain and dry. lExamine the stained film under oil immersion and look for LD bodies. 20.2.2.2 Interpretation The LD bodies or Amastigote form of the parasite look as pinkish oval outline with dark purple kinetoplast and nucleus (Fig-20.1) Leishman and giemsa staining of test specimen should be carried out with parallel staining of peripheral blood smear and known positive LD body slides to ensure properstaining results. Microscope lense and objectives should be kept dust free and oil free.The microscope mirrors should be free of dust and fungus growth.169CHAPTER - 21 LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF PLAGUE Plague is a bacterial infection of small mammals transmitted from animal to animal by the bite of infected fleas. Humans acquire plague from the bite of infected fleas, from direct contact with contaminated tissue and by inhalation of bacteria laden droplets.Bubonic plague is most common form of infection resulting from the bacteria beingtaken up by the host macrophages in the lymph node closest to the flea bite site. Theaffected lymph node becomes inflamed (bubo), enlarged and painful as the bacteriareplicate. From the infected lymph node the bacteria sometimes multiply and becomesblood borne (septicemic) and occasionally lodge in the lung (pneumonic). When plagueinfection becomes pneumonic, direct person to person transmission via respiratory dropletspread of bacteria becomes possible. Early diagnosis with prompt antibiotic treatmentis effective against all forms of plague infection. WHO laboratory test criteria for diagnosisof plague are as follows: 21.1 Laboratory test criteria for diagnosis of plague 21.1.1 Suspect Plague 1. Clinical symptoms that are compatible with plague, e.g., fever, sepsis syndrome, lymphadenopathy and/or acute pneumonitis in a person who resides in orrecently traveled to a plague-endemic area 2. If gram negative and/or bipolar-staining coccobacilli are seen on a smear taken from affected tissues, e.g. lBubo (bubonic Presumptive antigen detected in clinical materials by direct fluorescent antibody testing, or by some other standardized antigen detection method; or lIsolate from a clinical specimen demonstrates biochemical reactions consistentwith Y.pestis or PCR positivity or a single serum specimen is found positive fordiagnostic levels of antibodies to Y.pestis F1 antigen, not explainable on thebasis of prior infection or immunization 21.1.3 Confirmed lIsolate identified as Y.pestis by phage lysis of cultures or a significant (equal or more than 4-fold) change in antibody titre to the F-1 antigen in paired serumspecimens17021.2 Collection, Storage and Transportation Transport medium \u00d8sterile swab stick 21.2.3 collection of specimens 21.2.3.1 Collection of Bubo aspirate \u00d8Sterilize the skin surface of the bubo with tincture iodine. \u00d8Draw a few ml of sterile physiological saline in a 10 - 20 ml syringe fitted with 18 or 19 gauge needle. \u00d8Puncture the bubo and apply suction. If bubo fluid could not be aspirated, inject saline into the aspirate in the Cary Blair Transport Medium (CBT) for transportation to the laboratory. 21.2.3.2 Sputum \u00d8Ask the patient to expectorate into a sterile, wide mouthed container such as petri dish or in bottle containing CBT medium. \u00d8Put it in CBT medium for transportation to the laboratory. \u00d8Make smears with the sputum. 21.2.3.3 Throat swab Collect throat swab with sterile swab stick and put in Cary Blair Transport medium. 21.2.3.4 Blood (see chapte 4 for details)) \u00d8Collect 5 ml blood sample in plain vial. Allow the blood to clot. \u00d8Centrifuge and separate serum in another vial. \u00d8Store at +40C. \u00d8Transport to the laboratory under cold chain for serological investigations. \u00d8Collect acute and convalescent serum samples of the patients at an interval of at least 14 days.17121.3 Precautions in handling and collecting specimens As these specimens are likely to contain infectious substances, the following precautions should be applied : \u00d8Strict aseptic technique (gowns, gloves, masks) \u00d8Wash hands before and after the collection of material \u00d8Place the specimen aseptically in an appropriate sterile container \u00d8Tightly close the container \u00d8Label the container 21.4 Packaging/Transportation of specimen The samples should be appropriately packaged in a triple packaging system as given in chapter-4 and should be sent to the designated referral laboratory for furtherprocessing. The processing of the samples for Y.pestis are not to be carried out at districtlevel. Since plague is notifiable disease, the sample should be collected and sent to referral laboratories. 21.5 Reference diagnostic laboratories lCentral Plague Laboratory, Zoonosis Division, National Institute of Communicable Diseases.

Outbreaks of leptospirosishave been reported from coastal districts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Naduand Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Cases been reported from Goa,Karnataka, Orissa, and Andhra Pradesh. However, the entire shoreline is extremelyfragile in nature. States/union territories like West Bengal, Lakshwadeep from wherethe disease has not been reported, may be affected in future. The deltas of Godavari,Krishna, Mahanadi and Cauveri in addition to Ganga may also be future potentialareas for Leptospirosis. 22.1 Mode of Transmission Infection is acquired through contact with the environment contaminated with urine of an animal that is a carrier or is suffering from the disease caused by leptospires.Infection may also arise from bathing or accidental immersion in the fresh water lakes,rivers, or canals contaminated with the urine of the infected livestock that has beenusing the water for drinking or wallowing. Water may also get contaminated withrodent nests located on the banks especially after heavy rainfalls and inundations. 22.2 Clinical manifestations Guidelines for collection, storage, transportation, and processing of clinical material for diagnosis of leptospirosis from suspected cases 22.3 Collection and transportation of blood, urine, and CSF for isolation of leptospires The isolation of leptospires from clinical specimens is the backbone of diagnostic work and it confirms the clinical diagnosis of the disease. Leptospires can be isolatedfrom a variety of clinical specimens such as blood, urine, CSF , aqueous humor, amnioticor peritoneal fluids or from autopsy tissues such as kidney or liver. Collection of biologicalmaterial should be done taking recommended universal precautions. 22.3.1 Blood 22.3.1.1 Ideal time 7-10 days of the onset of the disease 22.3.1.2 Media Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH), Fletcher's and Stuart's, may be procured from Reference laboratory.17322.3.1.2 Procedure lSwab the area with the spirit lDraw the blood using sterile syringe and needle by vein puncture lInoculate two drops and four drops of blood into two tubes of 5 ml. Culture medium (two drops in the first tubes and four drops in the other). lTransport the inoculated media to reference laboratory at room temperature. 22.3.2 Urine 22.3.2.1 Time: 10-30 days after the onset of the disease. 22.3.2.2 Media: Same as above 22.3.2.3 Procedure lCollect the sample of midstream urine (freshly void midstream urine processed within 2 hours is the ideal specimen) lDilute the urine as follows using sterile test tubes and sterile phosphate bufferpH 7.2. (a) Add 0.4 ml of urine to 3.6 ml of PBS pH 7.2 (1 in 10) (b) Add 3 ml of (a) to 3 ml of PBS (I in 20) (c) Add 2 ml of (b) to 2 ml of PBS (I in 40)(d) Add I ml of (c) to I ml of PBS (I in 80) lEach resulting 0.5 ml dilution of above is inoculated into 4 separate 5 ml volume of medium lLabel tubes with dilution Transport the inoculated media to reference laboratory at room temperature Note: Urine may have acidic pH in many cases. Therefore, urine should be collected in tubes containing equal amount of PBS with pH 7.2. 22.3.3 CSF22.3.3.1 Time: 5-10 days of the onset 22.3.3.2 Medium: As above 22.3.3.3 Procedure: Inoculate 0.5 ml of CSF into 5 ml of culture media. Follow the same procedure as for blood collection. 22.4 Collection of serum samples Refer to Chapter No. 4 i.e. sample collection and transportation. The serum sample174for serological diagnosis should be collected on 7th day of illness or onwards. A second serum sample should also be collected after a gap of 5 to 7 days. 22.5 Serological diagnosis Tests available are : lLeptospira agglutination test 22.5.1.2 Procedure The serum under test is warmed at 56 0C for 30 minutes beforehand and is then diluted ten fold with physiological saline. 22.5.1.3 Screening Test 1. With 10 small test tubes, produce 5 series for 2 tubes each. 2. Pour ten fold diluted serum into one test tube of each series and physiological saline into the other test tubes in 0.25 ml quantities. 3. Add 0.25 ml of the antigen solution for each series and mix thoroughly.4. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes after warming at 50 0C for 2 hours. 22.5.1.4 Interpretation 1. Lightly shake each tube, and carefully visually check for the presence of any agglomerates while gently loosening precipitated bacteria. Check, however,that all control tubes are negative, have no agglomerate, and accordinglyhave a uniform suspensions. 2. Keep a record of the names of antigens that clearly produce agglomerates and, attach the names of the estimated pathogens to them. 22.5.2 Leptospira ELISA Test ELISA test is an enzyme immunoassay for the detection of antibodies to Leptospira biflexa (serovar patoc 1) for the serological confirmation of infections in serum, andplasma. This test is intended to be performed by trained laboratory personnel only. The kits are commercially available and manufacturer's instructions should be strictlyfollowed.17522.5.2.1 Reagents \u00d8Test strips: Microwells containing leptospira antigen - 96 wells in a test strip holder \u00d8Enzyme conjugate: Anti-human IgM antibody conjugated to positive \u00d8Stop solution :1 M phosphoric acid. 22.5.2.2 Precautions lDo not use solutions if they precipitate or become cloudy. Wash concentrate may show crystallization upon storage at 2-80C. Crystallization will disappear after dilution to working strength. lDilution buffer is a colloidal solution. It will appear opaque and have aprecipitate form. lDo not use serum that may have supported microbial growth, or is cloudy dueto high lipid content. Samples high in lipids should be clarified before use. lDo not add azide to any of the reagents or serum. 22.5.2.3 Storage Store between 2 - 80 C as per kit insert. Squeeze bottle containing diluted wash buffer may be stored at room temperature. 22.5.2.4 Materials required but not provided lPipettes lSqueeze bottle for washing strips (narrow tip is recommended) lReagent grade water and graduated cylinder lTubes for sample dilution lAbsorbent paper lELISA plate reader with a 450 nm and 620 - 650 nm filter (optional if results are read visually)17622.5.2.5 Procedure Test samples: Make a 1:40 dilution of patients sera and 390\u00b5l dilution buffer). 22.5.2.6 Performance of Tests 1. Break off number of wells needed (two for controls plus number of samples) and place in strip holder. 2. Note: Negative and positive controls are supplied pre-diluted. Do not dilute further. Add 40\u00b5l of RF Absorbent in a tube and add 100\u00b5l of positive controland negative to each tube respectively (#1, #2). Transfer all mixture serum add 40\u00b5l of RF Absorbent. Mix well,. Incubate in tube for 5 minutes. Transfer all 140\u00b5l of test samplesto the remaining wells (#3-#96). 3. Incubate at room temperature (15 to 25 0 C) for 10 minutes. 4. Shake out contents and wash 3 times with the diluted wash buffer.5. Add 2 drops of enzyme conjugate to each well.6. Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.7. Shake out contents and wash 3 times with wash buffer.8. Slap wells against paper towels to remove all liquid.9. Add 2 drops of the chromogen to every well.10. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.11. Add 2 drops of the stop solution and mix by tapping strip holder.12. Read within one hour of adding stop solution. 22.5.2.7 Reading Results Visually: Look at each well against a white background (e.g, paper towel) and record as clear or +,++ or +++ reaction. ELISA Reader: Zero reader on air. Set for bichromatic readings at 450/ 620 nm. 22.5.2.8 Limitations of the Procedure lSerologic results are an aid in diagnosis but cannot be used as the sole method of diagnosis. lThe ELISA has been tested against many serovars, but cannot guarantee thatall strains will react equally. 22.5.2.9 Quality Control The use of controls allows validation of kit stability. The kit should not be used if any177of the controls are out of range. Expected values for the controls are: Negative - 0.0 to 0.3 OD unitsPositive - 0.5 OD units and above. 22.5.2.10 Trouble Shooting Negative control has excessive color development. Reason: inadequate washingsCorrection: wash more vigorously. Remove excessive liquid from the wells by tapping against an Absorbent towel. Do not allow test wells to dry out. 22.5.2.11 Interpretation of the Test 22.5.2.11.1 Initially Non-reactive Samples interpreted as non-reactive (0.0-0.3 OD units, or zero color) indicate antibody is not present in the sample. Since antibody may not be present during earlydisease, (5-8 days incubation), confirmation 2-3 weeks later is indicated for laboratorydiagnosis. At this later time, patients showing weak reactions (0.5 - ] 1.0 or +, ++) should be further tested by alternate methods or re-tested 10-14 days later. A convalescentserum with a significant reaction (>1.0 OD) indicates the formation of specific antibodyagainst leptospira. An initially negative result followed by a positive result impliesseroconversion. 22.5.2.11.2 Initially Weakly Reactive Weakly reactive specimens should be cautiously interpreted. In normal populations, weakly reactive samples are infrequent but possible. Confirmation using a samplecollected 2-3 weeks later (paired acute and convalescent sera) is recommended. >1.0OD in the second sample confirms the presence of recent, specific antibody. [Caution: Ifthis is a cross-reactive antibody, the convalescent serum sample may not show a higherantibody level than the acute sample.] If sample reading remains at m 0.5 - ] 1.0 OD, or +, ++, a second methodology should be considered, or the sample may be interpretedas taken beyond rising titer (titer declining). 22.5.2.11.3 Initially Reactive Samples interpreted as strongly reactive (>1.0 OD or +++ or > may indicate the presence of specific antibody. Antibody presence alone cannot be used for diagnosis ofacute infection, since antibodies from prior exposure may circulate for a prolongedperiod of time.178CHAPTER- 23 CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY Introduction Laboratory services play a key role in the primary health care system. Investigations done in a laboratory serve as an important adjunct to the clinical history based diagnosis.In fact it helps in the confirmation of diagnosis of the disease and hence lead to theexact/defined treatment. Laboratory investigations/assays can be performed on various biological fluids and their products. Blood is the most important biological fluid and generally blood andits products are analysed in a clinical set up. Blood can either be venous or peripheral.Blood products include serum and plasma, which contain many metabolic substanceslike sugars, electrolytes, proteins and markers of liver function tests, kidney function testsand cardio vascular diseases. Information about the levels of these markers givesimportant preliminary indication about the liver, kidney and heart status of the individual.Besides blood, biochemical investigations can also be performed on CSF and urine. Basically blood is composed of a liquid portion known as plasma which contains many metabolic substances such as proteins, urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine, sodium,carbon dioxide, chloride and cholesterols etc. and a solid portion contains various cellslike WBC, RBC and platelets. 23.1 Equipment and Glasswares 23.1.1 Following instrument and Glasswares are required lColorimeter/Spectrophotometer/ Semi with micro and macro Cuvetts lElectronic balance lIncubator lHot air Oven lWater distillation mixer lEppendorff pipettes and tube stands179lTimer lVacutainer/blood collection tubes (1, 2, 5, 10, ml with screw cap) lSyringes (1, 2, 5, 10ml) lNeedles Spectrophotometer/Semi automatic analyser, are sophisticated, microprocessor controlled optical Instruments. It is advisable that the room should have adequateventilation and free from chemical fumes for proper functioning of equipment. For optical components to retain their quality, it is necessary to operate the instruments in dust free, non-corrosive environment. Optical surfaces must be cleaned or replacedperiodically. With time, the output of UV source gradually decreases which results indecrease in the sensitivity of the instrument. In such condition, UV lamp should bereplaced. Decrease output from the visible source is normally not that significant tocause decrease sensitivity. However, if decreased sensitivity is observed in the visiblerange, the visible lamp should be checked for a brown film coating inside the lamp. Ifthe brown coating is noticed, the lamp should be replaced. The cuvetts should always be washed properly and kept dried after use. Care of scratches on the cuvetts should be taken and if scratches are there, the cuvetts should bechanged. Such equipments should always be kept under Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC). 23.2 Quality Control Internal and external quality controls (QC) are the two different monitoring procedures for the quality control in clinical biochemistry. Internal QC is essential fordaily monitoring of precision and accuracy. Daily QC is of great value in detecting anyerror, large enough to invalidate the medical usefulness of the laboratory results. Externalquality assurance (EQA) is important for evaluating inter laboratory precision. Theconcepts of quality assurance has gained widespread acceptance today among Indianlaboratories. Laboratory personnel must know that QC is an obligatory to the patient,that is designed to give the analyst confidence in the method used and that its purposeis not to find or punish mistakes. Please see detail in chapter 24. 23.2.1 Internal Quality Control Assessment (IQCA) In clinical chemistry quality control programs are used to minimize random and systematic error. Through internal quality control, the laboratory can ensure that theresults being issued by the laboratory are reliable to allow decision to be taken with180confidence. 23.2.1.1 Accuracy and precision are two terms of internal quality control assesment, which are used normally in clinical laboratory. 23.2.1.2 Accuracy is the degree of agreement between a measured value and its true value. Accuracy can also be defined as the difference between the measured value andthe true value. 23.2.1.3 Precision refers to how close values are to one another or it is agreement between replicate values. More correctly precision refers to reproducibility. It is expressedin Standard Deviation (SD) or as a Coefficient of Variation (CV). A third term reliabilityis also used when a system is both precise and accurate. Most clinical chemistry laboratories include at least one quality control sample. A quality control sample is a substance, which contains the same analyte that is beingtested for, and has a certain nominal range associated with it. Substances that are oftenconfused with QC material are standards and calibrators A standard has a known exact value and purity associated with it. A calibrator is a substance with a set of particular values that has been determined. A calibrator may also be a standard and vice versa. A calibrator is often used to adjust aninstrument to certain values prior to using samples. A QC sample is never used to set up an instrument or method because it is run in the same manner as the patient samples and does not allow manipulation of an instrumentor method in order to achieve its associated values.Once a QC material is chosen, alaboratory should evaluate the control material during 20- 30 days period. This evaluationincludes statistical as well as other performance characteristics such as stability andpreparation time. The statistical evaluation generally includes calculation of the mean(X), Standard deviation (S.D). 23.2.1.4 Mean (X) = Where SX is the sum of individual data, N is number of data point 23.2.1.5 Standard Deviation (S.D) = S (X 1-X)2 / N-1 Where X1 is one of individual measurement, and X is the mean. Therefore the Standard Deviation is the deviation of data from the data's mean value. To calculate thestandard deviation, we obtain the difference between the mean value and eachmeasurement, square the resulting difference, and add them to determine the sum ofthe squares. The standard deviation is calculated by dividing the sum of square by N-1.SX N P181Table 23.1 Standard Deviation Limits for some common Biochemical Test chemistries Name of test Normal range Test type Curve type Standard Deviation (SD) Limits Blood Sugar (F) (60-110 mg/dl) End point Blanked Linear 8.00 Blood Sugar Total End Blanked Serum Creatinine mg/dl) Linear Bilirubin (Total) 6.6-8.7 gm/dl End point Blanked Linear 13.0 It is recommended that each laboratory establishes its own reference range to reflect the age, sex, diet and geographical location of the population. 23.3 Standardization (Calibration) Proper calibration and standardization of instruments, reagents and methods is essential in obtaining accurate results. The choice of a calibration and standardizationtechnique is affected by the instrumental method, instrument response, interferencespresent in the sample, purity of regents and number of samples to be analyzed. Themost commonly used standardization technique is the analytical or working curve. 23.3.1 Analytical Curve or calibration curve or standardization curve In the analytical (working) curve technique, a series of standard solutions containing known concentrations of the analyte are prepared. These solutions should cover theconcentration range of interest and have a matrix composition as similar to that of thesample solutions as possible. A blank solution containing only the solvent matrix is alsoanalyzed, and the net readings of standard solution minus blank (background) areplotted versus the concentrations of the standard solutions to obtain the working calibrationcurve. When using a single standard of known concentration the standardization iscalled single point standardization. But the preferred approach to standardizing a methodis to prepare a series of standards each containing different concentration. This is knownas multiple - point standardization. In multiple - point standardization at least threestandards should be used. A plot of measured value (OD) versus concentration ofstandards is known as calibration curve. A calibration curve shows us the relation ship182between the measured value and the analyte's concentration. The most useful calibration curve is a straight line. Since the method's sensitivity is the same for all concentrations ofanalyate. Results from calibration curve provide a systematic means of identifying sourceof error in analysis, such as depletion of test reagents, a defective instrument, or inaccuratestandard solution.

It is now widely accepted that quality assurance, quality control and quality assessment constitute as essential part of diagnostic testing Ingeneral quality assessment is one component of a total quality assurance programme. 24.1 Terminology We need to draw distinction between three commonly used terms. 24.1.1 Quality assurance (QA) is the total process that guarantees that the final results reported by a laboratory are as accurate as possible. This involves inspecting specimens,reviewing transcriptional measures, using the most reliable assays and verifying finalreports. 24.1.2 Quality control (QC) comprises those measures that must be included during each test run to verify that the test is working properly. This includes ensuring correcttemperature conditions, kit controls, etc. This QC indicates whether the test run wasvalid and has produced acceptable results. QC does not, however indicate that theresults are accurate, nor that they have been reported properly. 24.1.3 Quality assessment is a means of determining the quality of results. It is usually an external evaluation of a laboratory's performance using proficiency panels.

District laboratory needs to upgrade and develop rapid diagnostic techniques for such diseases which they can handle. 25.4 Preparedness for laboratory capacity lInformation regarding laboratory network should be available with district, so that there is improvement in the diagnosis of agents potentially used inbioterrorism. lBiosecurity in the laboratories should be strengthened to prevent the misuse,contamination or improper handling of agents. lThe quality control in laboratory diagnosis is to be inbuilt component. lTransfer of infectious samples should be done according to guidelines in theprevious chapter.207CHAPTER-26 MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENTS Of the large number of factors which affect the sensitivity/specificity of the test results generated by the laboratory, role of equipments being used cannot be ignored in final reporting. So vigilance is required at different level as far as theequipments are concerned. Some of them are listed below. lProcurement of equipments. lProper maintenance of equipments during use. lTimely calibration of equipments to ensure the uniformity in the results. 26.1 Procurement of equipments Following points should be kept in mind while procuring the equipments. lEquipments should be cost effective lIt should be easily available. lManufacturer should provide a good after sale service for the proper maintenance of the equipments. lSupplier/manufactures should have good stock of spare parts pertaining tothe equipments. lSupplier and manufactures should provide warranty/guarantee for a longerduration. lThe equipments supplied should be as per the user's specifications. lAn operative manual should be provided along with an equipment. lEquipments should be safe and easy to handle. 26.2 Some of the equipments required at district laboratory 26.2.1 Water Bath It is important that the water bath maintains a constant temperature within a narrow range (\u00b1 0.50C) when used. Inadequate adjustment and insufficient stabilization of the temperature will strongly affect the result of kinetic measurements. 26.2.1.1 Use of Water Bath 1) The level of water in the water bath must be above the level of the solution to be incubated. 2) Open containers, vials or tubes must be incubated in a water bath with an open lid to avoid contamination and dilution of the incubated material bycondensed water. 3) The water bath must be cleaned regularly to prevent growth of algae and bacteria.20826.2.1.2 Few applications of water bath are 370C Water Bath - For bringing laboratory material before testing to 370C when ever needed during performance of test 440C Water Bath- required in faecal coliform count (water bacteriology) complement in the serum. 26.2.2 Autoclave Bacteria and viruses cannot survive in such an environment of sterilization. It should be borne in mind that autoclaves need careful handling and must be regularly inspected.They can be hazardous and can seriously injure a person with hot steam accidentlyevaporating from the instrument. 26.2.2.1 The main factors influencing perfect steam sterilization are lSaturated steam. lTemperature. lTime. 26.2.2.2 Use of autoclave Refer to chapter-5. 26.2.3 Maintenance of Refrigerators The following general advice may be helpful for maintenance. lRefrigerators must be placed where sufficient air can pass the condenser (at the back of the refrigerators) for exchange of heat and also facilitate for cleaningof the condenser. lThe refrigerator door must seal perfectly to prevent warm outside air fromentering the cool chamber. lFor photovoltaic refrigerators the collector must be optimally positioned toensure production of enough electricity. 26.2.3.1 Daily checks lCheck temperature daily. It should not exceed 120C. Maintain record of daily temperature. lCheck gas bottles or kerosene tank for sufficient fuel in gas or kerosene fedrefrigerators. 26.2.3.2 Monthly checks lClean cool chamber and defrost monthly. lClean refrigerators from outside.209lMake condenser dust free. lClean door gasket. lPeriodically clean burner and check for gas leakage. lIn photovoltaic refrigerators, check level of electrolyte solution of batteries and fill up with pure distilled water, if necessary. 26.2.4 Centrifuge Two types of centrifuge are used, mechanical and electrical. The major aspects in maintenance of different types of centrifuges used in laboratory are as follows : lThe centrifuges must be positioned exactly horizontally to prevent the instrumentmoving away from its place when out of balance during centrifugation. Checkif the rubber buffer are in the buckets. lIt is critically important that the centrifuge's load is balanced at all times.Therefore, buckets should be loaded in matched pans and tubes should bearranged so that balanced tubes oppose each other in the centrifuge head.This is necessary to maintain the same forces of gravity in the opposite positionsof the tubes. This arrangement involves placing a \"dummy\", i.e. tube filledwith the appropriate volume of water corresponding to the weight of the volume,in the oppositely positioned test tube, when an odd number of specimens mustbe centrifuged. lTurn the speed control slowly up and down. lIf infectious material is being centrifuged, cover the centrifuge completely withplastic sheet during centrifugation. After use disinfect sheet and discard; bucketsshould be appropriately disinfected and dried. lStop the centrifuge immediately if it makes an abnormal noise. lAfter use the buckets should be inverted to drain dry. lAfter any sample spillage, wipe and disinfect immediately. lClean the centrifuge at short intervals (preferably daily) because it is one ofthe most frequently used instruments. lCheck mounting and replace if necessary. lCheck brushes and bearings every 3 months. Replace if necessary. lCheck for corrosion and repaint if necessary. 26.2.5 pH meters A pH meter consists of an electrode pair which is sensitive to hydrogen ion concentration due to the development of an electrical gradient, directly proportional tothe hydrogen ion concentration. The electrodes commonly used are one of glass for theunknown and the other of calomel to be used as a standard. Precautions to be takenwhile using pH meter are as follows:210lThe electrodes, specially the glass ones should be handled carefully to prevent breakage due to contact with hard surface. lSufficient time should be given to warm up the instrument before use. lFrequent standardization of the pH meter should be done using standard buffersolution. lElectrodes are to be washed with a stream of distilled water betweenmeasurements. lThe electrodes should never be removed from the solution when the measuringcircuit is closed. lWhen not in use, the electrodes must be kept immersed in water or electrodesolution. 26.2.5.1 Calibration of pH meters To obtain a precise measurement of pH, the pH meter must be calibrated with two different buffers at pH 4 and pH-7 every day (two-point calibration). Before measuringthe pH of unknown solution, the pH meter should be calibrated with standard buffer ofpH near to the targeted pH of the solution. For the calibration of a pH special buffersolutions must be used, the pH of which should be near the pH of the solution to bemeasured. Phosphate buffer and acetate buffer are preferable. Calibration measurementsshould be done using plastic containers. A pH meter needs to be standardized before each run with a standard buffer of pH 7.0. However, when the work is related to a pH range of less then 6.0, it is advisable touse a standard buffer of pH 4.0. The buffer should be discarded if the pH deviates morethan 0.4 or if the buffer is contaminated with microrganisms. 26.2.6 Incubator Incubators should be subjected to continuous recording of temperature. However, if it is not possible, the temperature must be recorded on a sheet or log book every dayand before opening the incubator. \u00f0Incubators are used for bacterial culture by laboratories working in microbiology. \u00f0The incubators must maintain a constant temperature of 35 0C \u00b1 20C. \u00f0Temperature should be daily recorded in incubators. \u00f0Like all laboratory instruments, incubators must be cleaned routinely at short intervals (at least every fortnight) and after spillage of infectious material. \u00f0The actual temperature must correspond to the thermometer control when the instrument is used. \u00f0Fumigation of the incubator is done occasionly21126.2.7 Hot Air Oven Hot air ovens are mainly used for drying laboratory equipments and medical devices in dry air. Hot air ovens are also used for sterilization. Sterilization in dry air isonly effective when the material is exposed for 60 minutes at 160 0C or for 40 minutes at 1800C. It is important to remember that the timing of sterilization is sufficient when the holding period begins after the air in the oven has reached its expected temperature. 26.2.7.1 Use of Hot air ovens 1. Set up the thermostat at the required temperature prior to sterilization. 2. If there is a fan, check if it is working.3. Allow to continue heating for an additional required holding time after the temperature reaches the pre-set degree. 4. Switch off the heat when the time is up.5. Wait until the temperature falls to 40 0C before opening the door. 26.2.8 Maintenance of balances The following guidelines are worth remembering lThe balance should be placed on a solid vibration-free surface, free from air currents and at room temperature away from sunlight. lThe instrument must be placed in an exactly horizontal position. lThe balance should be zeroed prior to each use. lUse the smallest possible vessel for weighing. Avoid weighing in vessels madeof plastic, because they can become electrostatically charged. Use, insteadglass vessel or weighing paper, as applicable. The weighing vessel and thesample to be weighed should be at the ambient temperature. Hands shouldnever be inserted into weighing chamber as it may give working effect. lPlace the sample to be weighed in a weighing vessel in the middle of theweighing pan, to avoid corner-load error. Liquid or powder should never bedirectly weighed on the pan. The weight of the weighing vessel needs to bedetermined prior to placing the substance to be weighed. A tweezer is usefulas a substitute for hands in the weighing chamber. lUse clean weighing vessel. Keep the working place, weighing chamber andweighing pan clean. To avoid any possible corroding effect of chemicals, anyspillage must be cleaned immediately. Biological material may be a source ofinfection. Disinfection can be done with 70% alcohol. lAfter completing weighing return the balance to zero weight. lKeep the working place near the balance as clean as possible.21226.2.9 Deep freezer (-200C) lShould have visible display unit (Temp). lTemperature should have back up support (UPS). lCheck temperature daily and maintain written record (sheet/log book). lTemperature should not exceed -200C. lMake sure that door is air tight. lDefrost every month after taking care of stored samples. 26.2.10 Microscope lPlace a slide on the stage, specimen side up and center of the section to be examined as accurately as possible over the hole in the center of the stage. lAdjust the mirror until it reflects the maximum amount of the light through thespecimen with the low objective in position, lower the body tube by means ofthe coarse adjustment until the objective is about \u00bc\" from the slide. lLook through the eye piece and slowly raise the objective with the coarseadjustment until the specimen is in approximate focus. Never focus downwardwhile looking the eye piece. Bring the specimen to sharp focus with the fineadjustment. Adjust the iris diaphgram and substage, condenser until the lightintensity is optimum. lAfter examining the specimen with the low power objective shift to the highdry objective by rotating the nose piece until the objective clicks into place. lLook through the eye piece and slowly raise the body tube with the coarseadjustment until the specimen comes into approximate focus. Then bring theimage into final accurate focus by using the fine adjustment. Once the specimenis in focus adjust the mirror and the iris diaphgram to give the clearest possibleimage. lFocussing of the oil immersion objective:- First use the low power objective to locate the portion of the specimen to be examined. Raise carefully the bodytube, and then rotate the nose piece until the oil immersion objective clicks intothe position. Now place a drop of immersion oil on the portion of the slidedirectly under the objective watching the objective from the side carefully,lower it into the oil. Do not allow the objective to touch the slide. Look throughthe ocular and slowly focus upwards with the fine adjustment until the imageappears. Once it appears do the fine adjustment and adjust the mirror andiris diaphragm to obtain optimum illumination. 26.2.10.1 Maintenance \u00f0Never touch the lenses if they become dirty, wipe them gently with lens paper/ lint-free smooth cloth.213\u00f0Always remove oil from the oil immersion objective after its use. If by accident, oil gets on either of the low powers, wipe of the objective immediately with thelens paper. If oil becomes dry or hardens on a lens, remove it with lens paperlightly moistened with xylol. \u00f0Keep the stage of the microscope clean and dry. \u00f0Do not tilt the microscope when working with the oil immersion system. \u00f0When the microscope is not in use, keep it covered in a microscope compartment. Never apply force to the microscope. Never allow the objectivelenses to touch the cover glass or the slide. Never lower the body tube with thecoarse adjustment while looking through the microscope. Never exchange theobjective or oculars of different microscopes. \u00f0Store the microscope in its cabinet when not in use TABLE 26.1 Quality Control Surveillance Procedure of Commonly Used Microbiology Equipments Equipments Procedure Schedule Tolerance Limit Refrigerators Recording of Temperature Daily or continuous* 20C to 80C Freezers Recording of Temperature Daily or continuous* -80C to -200C -600C to -750C Daily or continuous* 35.50C \u00b1 10C Water Bath Recording 380C 550C to 570C Autoclaves Test with spore strip At least weekly No growth of (Bacillus stearothermophlius) spores in subculture indicates sterile run.

Inputs from this level are the key to the effective functioning of any surveillance system. The success or failureof any public health or disease control initiative depends on establishing and maintaininga good information exchange system, with accurate and timely data being provided forappropriate action. Therefore, the importance of good laboratory data managementcannot be overstated. The \"laboratory data management\" includes: lRecording the details of the specimen tested lRecording the results of testing lAnalysis and interpretation of results lLooking at epidemiological patterns and trends lSummarizing the results in the form of regular reports 27.1 Guidelines for data management 27.1.1 Recording of data 27.1.1.1 Establish the set of minimum information to be recorded on each specimen oName, age, sex, in-patient/ outpatient status of the patient, broad geographical area to which the patient belongs, syndromic diagnosis. oNature of the sample/site of the sample, date of receipt of sample, date of processing of the sample, quality of the specimen received (cold chain condition,quantity, leakage etc.), inpatient/ outpatient source, investigation requested,result of the investigation such as nature of the pathogen isolated, resistancepattern, any other significant observation. oDesign a standard format for laboratory request, data recording, and data reporting. Reporting format for laboratories is annexed (Annexure I). 27.1.2 Data recording system oFor laboratories with smaller workload, manual maintenance of records can suffice oFor laboratories with larger workload, establish a computerized record system (Microsoft Excel, Epi-Info, FoxPro, Access, any other developed by IDSP)depending upon the type of data and the type of analysis required. oFeatures of the computerized reporting system: lUser and programmer friendly lRapid and accurate access to chosen/selected records216lAble to perform simple calculations e.g. frequency and time interval lCreate graphs and tables lWell documented installation procedures, user manual etc. oComponents of the computerized laboratory record system: lData entry lData cleaning and routine back up of data lRoutine analysis and reporting lFeedback lFeed forward oRecord the results (manual or computerized) in the form of specimen based database i.e. each line of information relates to one specimen. Therefore for acase with two specimens collected and processed, there will be two lines ofinformation. 27.2 Data flow lWhat information is reported, where it is reported from and where it is reported to must be clearly agreed upon by all parties involved in the system lAll information flow must be hierarchical, going from one level to the next,without missing levels. Information can also be broadcasted i.e. sent to severalsources at the same time. Data/ Information flow Feedback Fig : 27.1217lA diagram of information flow should be made including frequency of reporting and distributed to all parties so that everyone involved understands the reportingsystem. The system must be followed without exception. lReview the system from time to time to make any improvements. 27.3 Data analysis lRegular analysis and reporting followed by reporting has a direct effect on the surveillance system. It helps in: oProviding feedback to the programme managers for follow-up and supplementary planning oCoordination activities oMonitoring of laboratory results and performance to identify problems and constraints. oGenerating early warning signals for an outbreak. oMonitoring the changing trends of prevalent pathogens oMonitoring the emergence/ re-emergence of pathogens including agents of bioterrorism oEstablishing networks of laboratories & therefore preparedness for unusual activity round the year oDevelopment of laboratory database lAnalysis may be done on daily (during outbreaks), weekly, monthly, annual basis and also communicated according to the set protocols as per the guidelineslaid down by the IDSP. lAnalysis may be done on the basis of various parameters such as: oAge/sex distribution of patients oTime distribution of cases oInpatient/outpatient status of the patient oGeographical distribution of cases: clustering of cases oSyndromic diagnosis oNature of the sample oNature of the pathogen oResults of the investigation such as titers, resistance patterns. oCorrelation between different parameters oCorrelation with the epidemiological data. oUnusual activity in laboratory results as compared to the last observation e.g. last month or the same month of the last year or as compared to218previous years. This will help in not only picking up early warning signals but also contribute to monitoring the quality of results of the laboratory. lAnalysis and interpretation must be supported by baseline studies, which needto be performed from time to time to make the data generated more meaningful. lData analysis must also be presented as graphs, charts and maps (whereverpossible) for better comprehension and decision-making. lWherever possible, take the help of the software for data analysis. lThe interpretation generated from the analysis must be regularly conveyed tothe programme manger (disease surveillance units) for necessary action. lAnalysis and interpretation must be coupled with a feedback and feed forwardcomponent for all the partners involved in the system.219Monthly IDSP District Laboratory Report Name of District: Month/ Year: Investigation Samples Results Processed (no.)
