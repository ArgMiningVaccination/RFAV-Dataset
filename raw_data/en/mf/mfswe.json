Free Schools And Communities Regional Centers Program AN EAGLE'S VIEW Sharing Successful American Indian/Alaska Native Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention Programs Written and Edited by BiUHayne Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory 101 S.W. Main Street, Suite 500 Portland, Oregon 97204 Cover art by Jennifer Hayne Volume I September 1993 From the Directors An Eagle's View represents a truly collaborative process as the five agencies under the auspices of the Regional Centers for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program worked diligently to put this publication together. The thirty-six programs documented in Volume I represent the commitment made by each regional center director to recognize, share, and promote alcohol and other drug prevention programs serving American Indian! Alaska Native people throughout their ~espective regions. It is the hope of all of us involved in this project that Volume I of An Eagle's View will provide quality information and serve as a resource of ideas and materials, in addition to expanding the networking capabilities to assist others in designing new programs or enhancing existing strategies. The past several years have witnessed a tremendous surge of alcohol and other drug prevention str~tegies designed to establish healthier reservations, neighborhoods, schools and communities, families and individuals. Developed for and by American Indian! Alaska Native professionals and organizations, successful prevention and wellness-promoting programs are effectively engaging people and their communities in seeking to build and provide for a better future. An Eagle's View is a compilation of summaries describing programs, events, and activities designed to prevent the use of alcohol and other drugs by American Indian! Alaska Native people throughout our country. Programs included in Volume I of An Eagle's View represent a significant movement in Indian country to promote wellness and support those efforts to be drug-free. An Eagle's View documents strategies that include comprehensive, ongoing prevention programs, as well as annual, stand-alone events that may be school-or community-based. From \"Cherokee Challenge\" in Cherokee, North Carolina of Life\" in Bethel, Alaska; \"Turtle Mountain Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program\" in Belcourt, North Dakota to \"Center for Youth Development\" in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the various programs included herein represent people, families, schools, communities, pride in heritage, and a commitment to improving the health of a nation. We did not \"evaluate\" programs for inclusion in this book. We defined \"successful\" as something tlmt \"worked well\" and \"made a difference\" in your community, your neighborhood, and for your schools and your families. If you would like to recommend a program or practice to be considered for inclusion in Volume II, please see the RECOMMENDATION FORM at the back of this publication.

Box 365 Lapwai, Idaho 83540 (208) 843~ 7360 Focus Group: Upper elementary, middle school, high school students Feature: Enrichment and sports programming activities for American Indian youth Program Description: The Nez Perce Tribal Youth Sports Program (NPTYSP) grew out of a need to provide appropriate and\u00ad comprehensive recreational and educational program activities specifically focused on Indian children ages 8 -16 yrs. While the focus of the program is on Indian children and youth, participation in NPTYSP is open to all children from communities throughout the Nez Perce Reservation. TYSP's central fOGus is to ensure all Nez Perce youth have an opportunity to be active and involved in a year-round sports and enrichment program. Working through a collaborative partnership with Washington State University, in Pullman, Washington, TYSP designed a program which provides youth with exemplary 2 opportunities to engage in physical, social, emotional, academic and life skill development. Recognizing the impact alcohol and other drug related issues have had on the community and youth, it is a vital aspect of the overall program to provide alcohol/drug prevention strategies that will help empower Nez Perce youth toward building strong bonds to family, school, non-drug using peers, developing habits of well ness, and maintaining positive, healthy lives. Additionally, the program emphasizes career and educational opportunities, and particularly, strives to develop a better understanding among the Nez Perce youth of their cultural heritage, history and language. In July 1992, the Nez Perce Tribal Youth Sports Program began their planning phase by forming an advisory team of local school officials, Bureau of Indian Affairs, law enforcement, Children's Home program, Nez Perce Housing, Washington State University Physical Education Department, and other appointed members. This advisory team worked hard to set up a mission, goals and objectives~ program strategies and evaluation tools. Though the advisory team developed the program with American Indian youth as the focus, they modeled it after the National Youth Sports Program sponsored by the ----- ----- ---------~~------ -- .--~~ Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which is in its 24th year of operation. Through the collaborative relationship with Washington State University, TYSP staff members received training and technical assistance in developing the scope of their program. Washington State University physical education staff are providing the assistance for the evaluation component as well. Program activities include golf, archery, bowling, videos, basketball, softball, and soccer. In addition students are exposed to various employment opportunities through guest speakers and site visitations. Cultural aspects include Nez Perce language lessons, traditional dancing, drumming and singing, root digging, talking circles, wellness, sweatlodge, stick games and more. Through such a comprehensive offering of programs and activities, Ben Pe-im-tsa Youth Sports Program is able to recruit and collaboratively involve many facets ofthe Nez Perce community. 3 Western Regional center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Bethel, Alaska Calista Corporation -Yupik Eskimo Kalukaq-Celebration of Life Contact: Ms. Gretchen Ehrsam, Project Director Celebration of Life Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation P.O. Box 528 Bethel, Alaska 99559 (907) 543-5358 Focus Group: Pregnant and parenting women Feature: Based on the Yup'ik word for gathering together, Celebration of Life works from a positive approach in utilizing cultural traditions in providing a Circle of Care around pregnant women who wish to remain substance free during and after pregnancy. Program Description: As an integral aspect of the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, The Celebration of Life project serves fifty Yupik Eskimo villages in the Southwest region of Alaska. Assessment surveys, conducted with focus groups in several Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta villages, pointed out the urgent need to develop a program that is village based and provides greatly needed support, education, screening, and risk assessment to Native American women in the area where such services are inadequate to nonexistent due to the exorbitant cost of accessing the population by air. In addition to the inadequate services, the 4 project recognized cu\"ent research pointing out the Yukon-Kuskokwim area has a fetal alcohol syndrome birth rate of 4.5 per 1,000, which is 2 112 times greater than the national rate. Doug Modig and the MCHlFamily Planning Department applied for and received funding for the program through the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP). Implementation of the project has been through a collaborative partnership developed between mUltiple organizations and village tribal council members. Through the collaborative partners/lip process, programs and services, such as early intervention and screening, are delivered in an integrated and comprehensive fashion to alcohol and other drug-using pregnant and postpartum women and their infants. In order to coordinate the delivery system and provide effective case management services to the remote villages, the project utilizes a model of community intervention leading to the formation of a volunteer community intervention team (CIT). The CIT serves as an outreach team, making approximately 75 contacts per month with clients, arranging support services, monitoring client progress, and providing invaluable support to clients in achieving sobriety. A crucial part of the project combines a unique and innovative blend of Native American principles with Western Reglonal Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communitles current medical and service delivery protocols. The project staff received three months of intensive training and inservice on educational issues: fetal alcohol syndrome, nutrition, prenatal care, childbirth; and skill-building aspects: counseling techniques, documentation to medical records, team building, and community development. Cross training within the involved programs provides additional training opportunities for project staff and volunteers. Key aspects of the project's success include community involvement, having staff of the same ethnicity as the target population, a clear vision shared and owned by all staff members, recognition of turf issues and a willingness to confront them, and offering incentives to other agencies for cooperating. The evaluation component incorporates process measures of individual perceptions, experiences, and interactions as well as outcomes and service utilization patterns. Grant compliance and project objective documentation includes quantitative and qualitative approaches, such as participant observations and structured interviews. Additional data is provided by clients completing intake forms soon after joining the program, with follow-up every six months. Demographic characteristics, substance use patterns, and general well-being of the individual and family are reflected via the intake forms. Birth outcomes are documented, in addition to daily tracking of all services provided to the client. 5 At the time of this publication the Celebration of Life project has targeted five villages to receive services during this fiscal year. Coordination of services has been successfully undertaken between Celebration of Life and key organizations in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (e.g., the Community Health Aide Program, MCHlFamily Planning Clinic, Regional Substance Abuse Program, law enforcement and the court systems, tribal government and other tribal programs, social services, and alcohoVdrug treatment programs). We~\\tem Regional center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Arcata, California Hoopa, Yurok, and Karuk Tribes PARITY-Promoting Academic Retention for Indian Tribal Youth Contact: Dr. Sheila A Webb, Associate Dean and Parity Director Humboldt State University Teacher Preparation Programs Arcata, California 95521 (707) 826-5872 Focus Group: Native American and non-Native American students, grades six through twelve of the Klamath Trinity Joint Unified School District of northern California. Feature: Seeking to reduce dropout rates and bolster resiliency in students, PARITY is a retention program employing the next step concept, making the transition from one institution to the next a process demystified through faculty and student exchanges and sharing of resources at all the sites. Program Description: In seeking to reduce various risk factors and strengthen aspects of resiliency, PARITY program developers focused their effort on developing strategies for retaining students ~nd easing critical transition periods which traditionally see many students drop out of the system. Sensing the need for a collaborative planning process, Dr. Sheila A Webb, P ARlTY Director, actively sought the involvement of several agencies. During ----~------6 the first year the project, community partnerships included Humboldt State University, College of the Redwoods, Klamath Trinity Joint Unified School District, Hoopa Valley High School, Hoopa Tribal Education Association, Humboldt County Office of Education, Aetna Life and Casualty, Pacific Bell, Hoopa Valley Elementary School (grades 6-8), Title V Program, Jack Norton Elementary, Orleans Elementary, Trinity Valley Elementary, Weitchepec Elementary (Grades 6-8), Bright Futures Project, and the Karuk Tribe. As part of the planning process, a steering committee meets regularly throughout the year fulfilling the task of planning major events including fall orientation, fall retreat, Summer Bridge Enrichment, funding issues, public relations with the communities involved, and monitoring the project's overall structure. Designed as a retention program, the steering committee restructured curriculum and implementation in math, science, language arts and social science, in order to provide a more relevant education to students. Incorporated into the process are Native American social, cultural and historical contributions to the various disciplines. Faculty members from participating universities meet on a regular basis to discuss instructional methods and content with the following Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities four principles in mind: 1) learn about and respect the student population; 2) incorporate its values and interests into a relevant curriculum; 3) combine resources to enhance learning; and 4) maintain high expectations. By using these four principles as a framework for developing strategies and building on students' experiential knowledge, the curriculum encompasses elements in the natural environment and the importance of interrelationships among the disciplines. This approach leads to a greater understanding of the students' surroundings and their relationship to a larger, exciting world of learning, academic adventure and exploration. Often this becomes a school without walls as students study outdoors at various locations and with a variety of teachers since cross-institutional exchanges occur regularly. PARITY has proved to be the impetus for promoting a caring, responsive school and extended educational community, while maintaining high expectations for student learning and attitudes. The importance of institutional support for those staff members involved is reflected in release time, shared resource materials, cross\u00ad institutional collaboration, orientation and retreat planning meetings, professional development activities, and a sharing of both human and physical plant resources among all partner sites. Monitoring and evaluating the progress ofP ARITY included data collection from participating schools and organizations. Attendance and absentee rates, grades and academic performance indicators, and CTBS scores were compiled during fall and spring semesters 7 by an Internal Evaluator. The Internal Evaluator assessed retention, grades, absences, and CTBS scores, finding \"compelling evidence of the program's success in the form of CTBS scores.\" The enriched curriculum and a Summer Bridge program have been assessed as the source for improvement ofCTBS scores across all areas of testing, particularly in science, mathematics, English and reading. These results have led to the curriculum changes being institutionalized. Serving a population separated by mountainous terrain spread over 1,100 square miles, the program citesfour key components to success: 1) cross institutional and community support promoting the common good of assisting students; 2) dedication of staff and personnel; 3) respect for the students and community; and 4) involvement of all partner participants as equals. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Tacoma, Washington Puyallup Tribe PRIDE: Positive Reinforcement In Drug Education-ChiefLeschi Tacoma, Washington 98418-0370 Focus Group: Students in kindergarten through grade twelve. Feature: PRIDE is a comprehensive K- 12 substance abuse prevention program that encompasses all aspects of the educational program at ChiefLeschi Schools. Its message of no use/no tolerance is stated at all school and community-based events. Program Description: Assessing the situation through student, staff, and parent surveys, a committee cited a general feeling of desperation at the problems caused by substance abuse in the community, and a lack of knowledge and understanding of the causes and results of substance use/abuse. Superintendent, Linda Rudolph took matters into her hands and immediately formed a planning team consisting of teachers, substance abuse counselors, administrators, community members, and elders. The planning team worked stringently to form community alliances resulting in cooperative agreements with all Tribal Service 8 Organizations within the Puyallup Tribe including Tribal Treatment Center, Kwawachee Mental Health Center, Children Services, Elders Program, Tribal Medical Center, Law Enforcement, Tribal Government, Planning, Higher Education, Fisheries, and Economic Development. Community agencies include the Rotary, local media, Pierce County Health and Sheriff Department, Bureau ofIndian Affairs and Indian Health Services, local community colleges, Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Tacoma, Federal Way, and Fife School Districts. PRIDE is based upon a K-12 comprehensive, school/community, curriculum written by ChiefLeschi stat! for ChiefLeschi students. It is a year\u00ad round program taught to. all grade levels to a total student population of 560 students, representing 54 federally recognized tribes. The program reaches out further than the classroom, striving to demonstrate that a substance-free life can be both appealing and desirable. Activities to support PRIDE are varied and multifaceted, thereby promoting a collaborative relationship within the school and community. A \"Run for Sobriety\" boasts 100 percent student/staff participation with many Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities community members attending. The Run begins with a sunrise ceremony. Drug\u00ad free dances for junior and senior high students are held to coincide with various holidays and events. Each school and grade level participates in field trips to places of significance to American Indian students. Picnics, skating parties, swimming parties, and various cultural events held throughout the year further emphasize the message of alcohol and other drug-free and healthy lives. Training for staff occurs throughout the school year. Orientation to the curriculum takes place before school begins and is revisited during regular staff meetings and special inservice days. The community receives training through special parent training/consultation sessions held in the evenings at the elementary school during the year. Awareness and community education occur via local news coverage, school/community functions, and newsletter articles. Assessment procedures rely on student records for the year in compiling needed data, such as academic grades, attendance rates, behavior and disciplinary referrals, and documented alcohol and other drug-related incidents. The records have indicated successful improvement in each of the areas previously listed. Most notably, a reduction in drug-related incidents is significant due to the influx of new students each year. Students fill out an anonymous survey at the end of the year to assess impact of PRIDE on their lives. School staff provide further assessment of the curriculum though surveys and lesson/content evaluations. Responding to evaluations and input from staff, there 9 is a movement towards infusing the curriculum into as many subject areas as possible, with the idea that by 1997-98 it will be part of the curriculum for all disciplines. This project isfunded through Drug\u00ad Free Schools and Bureau ofIndian Affairs. ------- ---- Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Early Intervention Program Contact: Russ Martin NW Inter-Tribal Youth Early Intervention Program 226 Sudden Valley Bellingham, Washington 98226 (206) 734-9747 Focus Group: Native American youth, age 12-20 years. Feature: Providing nine youth advocates who offer support group meetings and planned alternative activities on high-risk nights and holidays, and promoting healthy lifestyle choices for the youth in seven communities. Program Description: Beginning in 1987 as a grass roots initiatil'e involving youth and a few community volunteers, the Northwest Intertribal Youth Early Intervention Project has become a program of education, support, recreation, and intervention serving up to 300 youth from seven different communities. The youth were the strength of this movement as they recognized the need and desire for alternative, drug-free activities on those nights when \"everyonell was into use and abuse of a substance. Responding to this expressed 10 desire, Paulette RunningWolf and other concerned community members sought out and received funding from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), though the program operated for a full year before funding was obtained from CSAP. Planning for the project was led by the Intertribal Youth Group, with appropriate guidance and assistance from program advocates. Together with the program advocates, the youth plan, coordinate, and engage in drug-free activities as often as three times per week in their respective communities. Activities include educational events, support group meetings, outdoor excursions and more. Additionally, all the youth from the seven tribes meet for major drug-free social events/activities, such as special trainings or conferences, summer camp/retreats, dances. Due to the varied tribal representation of the youth, community alliances and collaborative partnerships became critical in providing support to the project. Training for the nine advocates is ongoing and includes topical issues such as: substance abuse prevention, youth support, group facilitation, crisis intervention, grief and loss, and suicide Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities prevention. The community advocates are hired on a part-time basis to coordinate activities in their communities and serve as a support system to the youth. A critical aspect of the program is obtaining an endorsement and sponsorship from each tribal council, as each community advocate is supervised by a tribal agency (usually the tribal human services department or alcohol and other drug counselor). Families are also involved by volunteering for events, chaperoning activities and participating at as many events as they can. The youth in the project make a verbal and written commitment to \"clean and soberl! behavior while involved, made formal through a signed contract. A picture identification card is given to each participant which provides them with special privileges at local commercial businesses. A monthly newsletter helps promote the project, coordinate events, involve the communities, and maintain awareness of the benefits of a drug-free life. Project evaluation is an integral component of Northwest Intertribal Youth Early Intervention operations. The community advocates track all activities in a monthly log, monitoring attendance and community involvement. Demographic data is compiled via a status report as each youth participant accesses the project. In 1992 a major attitude/substance use survey was completed on 90 youth participants to gain a measure of baseline data. This survey will be repeated in 1994 to ascertain program outcomes and benefits. Early assessments indicate that youth who participate in the project remain alcohol and other drug resistant. To 11 date, approximately 200 youth regularly participate and have made contract and personal commitments to healthy living, going to school, and developing healthy peer networks. Many of the older participants who have been with the program for 4-5 years have become leaders in their communities and solid role models for the younger participants. Pointing out the pitfalls of politics and occasional lack of tribal council support, project coordinators are quick to state that these problems have been overcome and worked out. This has been accomplished through open communication and a mutual understanding of the need to support youth who desire to lead healthy lives. Keys to success include a strong commitment and follow-through by the community advocates and the youth themselves, being in touch with and meeting the needs of youth, and respecting what youth desire and empowering them to accomplish those goals. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Reno, Nevada Washoe, Paiute, Shoshone Tribes Reno Sparks Indian Colony Prevention Coalition Contact: Daniel Thayer Project Specialist Reno Sparks Indian Colony Prevention Coalition 405 Golden Lane Reno, Nevada 89502 (702) 324-4600 Focus Group: All ages within the reservation community. Feature: Development and promotion of collaborative working partnerships within a diversified reservation community to enhance service delivery, educational offerings, and advocating for a healthy, drug-free community for all community members. Program Description: Seeing the need to coordinate services to 743 community members spread out over two locations, Connie Espinoza, tribal grants writer, sought out the involvement of key members within the community to be involved in the planning and development of the coalition. Initially, several tribal council members provided critical support to the planning phase and program development. Eventually, directors of the education, housing, finance, and tribal resolution programs were successfully recruited to be part of the planning process and actively ------~---~--------- ----12 supported the efforts to collaboratively involve multiagencies and programs in assessing the needs of the community and prioritizing goals. With networking and developing an effective collaborative approach to promoting healthy lifestyles as a focus, community alliances were enlisted to become a part of the Goalition. Partnership networks were formed between alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment programs, Tribal government, the media, social services, the school system, health and social services, the judicial and law enforcement agencies, families, elders and youth organizations, a university campus, and several community businesses. The Coalition's progress during the first year was marked by a receptive audience and the development of livery good working relationships with all members of the Coalition. II In order to meet the needs of the reservation community, the Coalition's full participation and input is crucial for the direction of the project. The ability to effectively plan and develop strategies for targeted groups or locations depends upon the total participation and support of the Coalition members. To assist in developing full participation and involvement from members, the ----I Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities following three activities occur on a regular basis: 1) monthly coalition meetings, 2) quarterly steering committee meetings, and 3) monthly youth committee meetings. The content of meeting discussions are shared among the committees and overall Coalition membership to ensure full communication. Strategies developed by the Coalition's committee structure include trainings related to AOD prevention for community members, youth alternative activities, tribal program directors' trainings, and professional staff development. A major highlight of the Coalition's effort was a youth retreat. The youth retreat incorporated workshop sessions on alcohol and other drug awareness, gang involvement prevention, self-esteem, peer pressure, fetal alcohol syndrome, and AOD-free dances. The youth also took a leadership role in encouraging the Coalition to plan and coordinate an adult retreat with similar activities to put everyone on the same level of understanding of the issues facing youth and adults in the community. In assessing progress of the Coalition, coordinators point to pO'sitive feedback from the community and the commitment by youth to stay AOD free. Evaluations are taken at every function, workshop and presentation to help determine if activities are meeting the defined goals and needs of the community. Sign-ill sheets are utilized at every meeting to assess involvement, which has been shown to be very high and consistent-a sign of success in and of itself 13 Western RegIonal Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Inchelium, Washington Colville Indian Nation Annual Sobriety 99138 722-4575 Focus Group: Camp is hosted by the Colville Indian Nation, but is open to all tribes and people of all ages. There is a separate youth campout for students in grades one through twelve. Feature: In its 16th .year, the Intertribal Sobriety Campout incorporates mutlifaceted strategies and activities in bringing people together in an alcohol and other drug-free camping environment which emphasizes American Indian culture and traditions. The Youth Camp out is in its second year and utilizes a similar format !'.\"1d focus. Program Description: If ever there was a grass roots movement that has inspired the involvement of a multitude of people and agencies, the Sobriety Campout is such a program. Beginning sixteen years ago out of the need to celebrate the accomplishment of sobriety for a handful of dedicated people, the event has continued with people traveling from all over the country to participate and celebrate their sobriety. 14 Pierre Louie, Camp Director, took over the operation of the camp out fifteen years ago and has work diligently to nourish collaborative relationships with a variety of programs and agencies. Due to his hard work, community relationships have been formed and maintained with alcohol and other drug treatment programs, tribal government and other programs, family/healthlsocial services, court systems, Title V Indian Education and Johnson OIMalley programs, various religious organizations, media, and a multitude of volunteers. Mr. Louie1s attitude has developed a sense of togetherness that encourages the various community programs to experiment and challenge themselves to get involved in new ways. The result finds many of the programs coming to him now with ideas to try and new activities to incorporate. Mr. Louie indicates the project is successful due to the people who continue to come and participate in the six day event. The number of people attending has grown dramatically over the past several years and serves as an indicator of how successful the event is. From a small, yet significant core of 25 people sixteen years ago, over 3,000 people from various regions and tribal nations attended in 1991. IIPeople come to enjoy themselves, to let things happen, ------------------------------------------------------- Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities instead of following a daily program, II states Mr. Louie. While there may not appear to be a set structure moving people through an agenda each day, the activities are set up to allow participants to engage in an experientially rich atmosphere. Activities include: sweats, swimming, boating, hiking, Alcoholics Anonymous and Al\u00ad Anon meetings, family groups, a pow wow, and meals every day. The Youth Campout, which takes place August 12- 14, utilizes a similar format, but also seeks to involve the youth in activities focusing on responsibility, spiritual and traditional aspects, respect and sharing, story telling, and drumming. When offering advice to other people seeking to develop a similar program or event, Mr. Louie points out the needfor a vision and the enjoyment of people. Being able to enjoy people and provide an avenue of celebration means stepping out and challenging ourselves to follow dreams. Funding for the camp out is generated from Ferry and Stevens County Mobilization donations, as well as fees charged per car. The annual Intertribal Sobriety Campout began as a dream-a dream of gathering friends and family to share the celebration of each person's sobriety. 15 Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Browning, Montana Blackfeet Indian Nation Vision Student Assistance Program: Browning Public Schools Contact: Lee D.

Feature: A comprehensive student assistance program offering inservice, assemblies, support groups, alternative activities, alcohol and other drug (AOD) prev:ention curriculum, team building, intervention, peer programs, and more, all reflective of providing students and staff with a total, holistic assistance program. Program Description: Beginning in 1989 from an expressed need for increased administrative support for the school staff, a survey was conducted among all school-related personnel. The results revealed a strong desire for more student and staff support groups to be offered and facilitated. To ensure a comprehensive programming effort was employed, Gwen Brott, coordinator of the Vision program, 16 developed a two-fold strategy. A community-wide Task Force was formed to examine resources, services, and goals in developing collaborative partnerships among the various programs and organizations. The initial goal of gaining support and involvement from as many programs as possible was attained as tribal government and other tribal programs joined with Browning School System and AOD treatment programs) businesses, family/health and social services, law enforcement and the court system, religious organizations, and a variety of volunteers. The collaborative partnership was built upon a strong relationship established between the Browning School System and law enforcement (Drug Abuse Resistance Education and juvenile officers in particular), Health Department, Housing, and AOD treatment programs. A second . aspect of the planning and development of the Vision program involved creating vision teams in each school building. The vision team was made up of a variety of school staff who monitored and assessed the needs of students and staff,\u00b7 strategies to meet the needs, and progress of the program. An employee assistance program has been developed and includes support groups, wellness activities and more. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Trainings offered through the Vision program are open to all sta~ community members and students in grades 7-12. A special effort is made to involve tribal elders and leaders in the trainings to foster relationships between school and these significant groups. Inservice is held several times a year, with special workshops offered as needed or requested. Topics such as community intervention, basic awareness, support group facilitation, fetal alcohol and other drug affected students, AIDS, parenting, and solvent abuse are just a sample. All new staff are required to attend eight hours of awareness training. Activities developed through the Vision program are held monthly and include some very innovative approaches for assisting students and the community to develop healthier standards of living. A particularly creative activity is the All Night Running Affair, a 17-hour all night run held in memory of those who have died due to alcohol and other drug related accidents. Students, staff, community members and statewide representatives are involved in the All Night Running Affair, which culminates with breakfast cooked to order by school staff. Other activities include Art in the Park, Young Authors' Fair, kite flying, Jump Rope Against Drugs, Christmas caroling, ice skating, Teen Institute Camp, Caring For Kids Conference, New Year's Eve Carnival and Dance, Mini\u00ad Olympics, and a much more. Evaluating the program's effectiveness and progress takes place with each activity, training, and event sponsored by the Vision Program. Each participant fills out a survey report for any activity they are involved in, providing --------------17 demographic data and impact effectiveness of the activity. A pre-and post test are employed for specific trainings and events. Accumulated data revealed support groups have had a tremendous impact upon students' and staff's general sense of well-being and ability to stay clean. Records also indicate a drop in student fights and disciplinary referrals. There were no recorded drug busts or bomb threats during the 1992-93 school year. In identifying key strategies for the success of the Vision program, Ms. Brott points to the need to \"get all the right people involved up front in order to gain their support and active involvement in a true collaborative process.\" Willingness to work hard and a genuine commitment to children are the cornerstones of a successful program. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Lame Deer, Montana Northern Cheyenne Reservation Department of Alcohol and Drug Studies Dull Knife Memorial College Contact: David Tompkins, Director Department of Alcohol and Drug Studies Dull Knife Memorial College P.O. Box 98 Lame Deer, Montana 59043 (406) 477-6215 Focus Group: College level students and community participants. Feature: Providing an Associates of Applied Science and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) studies degree designed for students intending to work in the chemical dependency fields. Additional services include community and professional workshops, consultation, AOD resource library, inservice trainings, and post-degree internships. Program Description: Designed as a counselor training program providing academic and practical preparation necessary for students to gain alcohol and other drug counselor certification in the state of Montana, the Department of AOD Studies provides a comprehensive array of services vital to any total health care service system. Students participating in the program are exposed to opportunities to gain: 1) theoretical expertise in the nature, treatment, and prevention of chemical and process addictions, 18 2) applied expertise in the development of the addiction counselor's competencies in the areas of knowledge and skills, 3) understanding of professional and ethical responsibilities, and 4) self understanding of personal and professional potential as it relates to the rehabilitation process. In 1988, David Tompkins, Director of the Department of Alcohol and Drug Studies, developed an advisory committee to work collaboratively together in the program's planning process. This program advisory committee was originally composed of a curriculum committee, counselors, Indian Health Services Recovery Center staff, college staff, and other key program staff. Currently the program advisory committee has expanded to include the school system, social and human services, the court system, and tribal programs. Work with the reservation community includes a variety of training and workshop events offered for the general community and for the professional organizations. For the professional workers, workshops related to issues of addiction and dysfunction affecting individual agencies are made available and are specifically tailor-made for each agency and its employees. An added Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities aspect of this for the professional community involves the maintenance of a consultant pool of area professionals to respond to expressed needs. The community workshops are designed to raise awareness of addictions and related topics, including AIDS, codependency, adult children of alcoholics, dry drunk syndrome, communication skills, and eating disorders. A resource library containing several hundred titles is maintained and available to the reservation agencies, as well as to enrolled students. When evaluating progress of the Department of Alcohol and Drug Studies, two aspects are involved: 1) the effectiveness of the community and professional workshops, and 2) the progress and success of students enrolled in the counselor training program. For each workshop sponsored and provided by the program, evaluations are filled out by every participant with the results assessed to determine if it was effective or met the desired objectives. Data generated by the evaluations are reviewed by the program advisory committee to determine the progress of the program and make recommendations for the next year's training agenda. Assessing indications of success for the counseling training program, Mr. Tompkins points to the fact that seven trainees have become state certified counselors in the last two years, while all graduates are employed in the chemical dependency field. Key aspects of the development and success of the program involve the collaborative networking among agencies and.meeting the needs expressed by the community. Working collaboratively 19 allowed the Department of Alcohol and Drug Studie.s to access resources, including people and funding sources, effectively plan strategies to meet the needs of their community, and allow for dynamic and continual assessment through the program advisory committee. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities N orne, Alaska Bering Strait Bering Strait Community Partnership Contact: Douglas McCoy Principal Investigator Nome Community Center P.O. Box 98 Nome, Alaska 99762 (907) 443-5259 Focus Group: All members of the Community of Nome and 15 Native villages in the region. Feature: The primary mission of the Community Partnership program is to help local communities throughout the 44,000 square mile, northwest region of Alaska develop a clearer \"VISION\" for stronger and healthier communities. Through an active and practical visioning process, communities can claim a clearer vision of hope. Program Description: The Partnership is an effort to empower the villages and develop cooperative efforts among the service providers in a direct response to the needs and goals of each community. Covering a 44,000 square mile area in northwestern Alaska, the Partnership is based out of Nome, which serves as a hub community providing services and support to the outlying, and often remote, fifteen villages. Most of the fifteen villages can only h~ reached by airplane, which creates a serious dilemma for many of the 20 communities whose needs are neglected. The Partnership seeks to offer a solution to this geographical distancing and service neglect. In October of 1990, an assessment survey was conducted among the region's service providers. It wa~ determined that services were often duplicated, there was a lack of services provided and a lack of coordination among providers, and that services were often provided that were not necessarily needed or wanted by the villages. Following the results of the survey, the Interagency Child Advocates for Norton Sound, an organization of service providers, put together a planning team to write a grant proposal and begin the planning phase. The planning team included the school principal, teachers, an executive of the Native regional corporation, tribal council members, community leaders, service providers, and various agency staff. Funding was approved and provided by a grant from Health and Human Services and Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP). Developing a regional strategy included the following program activities: 1) yearly village visioning events to establish an action plan and set goals; 2) resource support provided on a daily basis, as needed, for the villages; 3) coordination of efforts in alcohol and other drug prevention events and Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities technical assistance in grant writing; and 4) organizing a collaborative process of services for the various providers and agencies. Program staff and partnership members, including elders and students, attended CSAP-sponsored training opportunities on a variety of topics including needs identification, developing goals and objectives, overcoming barriers to participation, creating coalitions, community organizing, and resourcing communities. Assisting groups and committees in developing collaborative partnerships and a vision for those partnerships entails great sensitivity, a clarity of roles and expectations, an ability to empower others to overcome their self imposed limitations, and a capacity for getting others to focus their energies on practical steps and objectives. The training provided by CSAP has allowed those involved to gain varying levels of strength and competence in achieving the program's main goal of helping communities to establish a vision and appropriately follow through with goals and objectives. As with many partnerships, the first two years focused upon obtaining support and participation from the villages and service providers, promoting the purpose of the program, and developing an inclusive atmosphere. Evaluation of the program employs an outside evaluation team which monitors the progress of the partnership, the activities and strategies, and the results of the program's effort. Data is generated through on-site interviews of key village informants, staff reports of all activities, gathering of drug-related information and indicators, minutes of 21 partnership meetings, and open discussion with agency staff. Indications of progress include overcoming initial opposition leading to more agencies becoming involved, villages planning events together, political entities in villages working together, and agency staff working together and coordinating their efforts. The major obstacle of the program has been finding methods to assist groups in overcoming the distrust, antagonism, past histories, turf issues, and racism. Though people are working together more than ever, these issues are dealt with constantly and consistently, and the importance of open communication in confronting and overcoming such critical sources of conflict i~ clear. Making each visioning event a community celebration has helped ease some of the tension and provided a platform for approaching solutions, making the celebrations a key strategy for success. Other key aspects involve open, one-on-one conversation, providing opportunities for participation from the very beginning, and realizing the need to move forward even though there are members of the community who will not join the program. .-------------------------~-.- Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Various Washington Swinomish, Lummi, Day Contact: Joe Dunn, Director Swinomish Alcohol Program P.O. Box 388 LaConner, W A. 98257 (206) 466-7233 Focus Group: All ages, with an emphasis on elementary through high school students. Feature: A one day, alcohoVdrug-free event hosted by one of seven northwest Washington tribes, for the purpose of developing intertribal unity in promoting hope, healing, and healthy living. Program Description: Beginning in 1983, the Annual Intertribal AlcohoVDrug Abuse Awareness Day was organized out of an expressed need for tribal elders and youth to participate together in a drug-free environment. A concerned group of alcohol and other drug prevention program directors and counselors began meeting to discuss mutual needs and issues relative to substance abuse among several northwest Washington State Indian nations. As a result of their collaborative efforts, the annual educational and prevention event has grown to attract over one thousand people to the various tribal locations. 22 The event is rotated from reservation to reservation with participating tribal nations serving as organizing partners in planning, promoting, and organizing the all day event. Planning for the annual Awareness Day begins a full ten months prior to the event with discussions of the written evaluations provided by participants at the previous year's event. This process allows the group to plan according to the program's strengths and recommendations for improvement. The planning team consists of representatives from each of the seven tribes who meet on a monthly basis. With each tribe serving as a host for the event on a rotating annual basis, the need for collaborative plannillg and sharing of resources is crucial to the overall success and impact of the event. The various representatives on the planning team are also responsible for communicating back to their respective tribes to promote and gain community\u00ad wide sp,pport for the event. In order to improve communication lines, representatives have formed local community alliances, including treatment programs, businesses, tribal government and tribal programs, family and social services, law enforcement, media, schools, and religious Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities organizations. Such community alliance building has allowed each tribe to generate a solid funding base through donations; as well as resource sharing and successful promoting of the event within each program's clientele base. Data is collected through evaluations filled out by each participant in attendance. In order to increase the return of evaluations, a grand prize drawing is held and awarded only to those who have turned in an evaluation. Demographic information is obtained, but the critical information needed for programming comes from the written comments and suggestions offered by participants. Matched with demographics, the written portion of the evaluation serves to assist the planning team in meeting the needs and desires of those in attendance. An indicator of the event's success comes in ,the form of attendance, which has climbed from 200 in 1983 to over 1,000 ten years later. Other indicators of success include the governor of Washington signing a proclamation declaring the third week of April as Intertribal Awareness Week and the fbrmation of two new awareness day events in another region of Washington State, modeled after the Intertribal Awareness Day. A key to success is obtaining the support of each tribal council through the passing and signing of a tribal resolution supporting the event and those members involved in the planning. Being sensitive to each tribe's uniqueness, yet recognizing the common issue of substance abuse, is the foundation for the event's success. Also, listening to people's needs and interests in order to provide a better and more impactful day 23 creates the necessary ingredients for success. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Browning, Montana Blackfeet Indian Nation Stay In School Program, School District No.9 Contact: Carol C. Juneau, Director Stay In School Program Box610 Browning, Montana 59417 (406) 338-2841 Focus Group: Students in kindergarten through high school at risk for dropping out or already out of the school system. Feature: A comprehensive dropout prevention program consisting of outreach and advocacy fQr students and their families, tutorial and instructional assistance, parent and staff training, and a summer school program. Program Description: The need for a dropout prevention program was determined after a 1991-92 survey, administered to students, parents, teachers and other community members, revealed a high level of concern for dropout rates and the need to reach those students through such a program. Once the need. was assessed through survey results, a planning team was formed, consisting of school administrators from the K-12 levels. This planning team met to determine how best to meet the needs of students and develop a proposal to obtain/unding from the Department of Education's Dropout Demonstration Assistance Act. Once the program 24 proposal was approved for funding, program staffbegan forming community linkages and an advisory board. The advisory board for the Stay In School Progra.m is made up of individuals from businesses, community agencies, social services, and juvenile system. The effort to create community linkages has been successful in that a total of nineteen organizations, agencies and programs from the community are involved in offering their services and resources to the program. The community linkages aspect is critical to the success of the program as the needs of the at-risk-for-dropout students spill over into the community in a unique way and require the collaborative networking and sharing of program resources to meet their needs. The Stay In School Program utilizes six major components within the framework of operation: 1) Elementary Outreach Advocate to strengthen home-school communication and relationship; 2) Outreach High School, which provides an alternative instructional program for ninth-through twelfth-grade students currently out of the school system allowing access to high school diploma completion via semi-independent study program on a contract basis; 3) K- 8 Tutoring, conducted on an individual Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities and small group basis for students needing academic assistance, with particular emphasis on English/language arts and math; 4) parent and staff training in areas of improving parenting skills, strategies to help their children be successful in school, strengthening communication skills, and teacher strategies for working with at-risk students; 5) communityischool awareness, including an advisory board consisting of students, school and community members, providing guidance of school operations and increasing awareness of program throughout the Blackfeet reservation; 6) a summer school program designed for credit\u00ad deficient students to earn required course work outside the regular school year. A formal outside evaluator works with the program on an ongoing basis throughout the year on evaluation and techniques to help strengthen the program. Data collectiofl is required of the program through the Department of Education and provides demographic information, in addition to information on academic contracts, performance of students and staff, parent involvement, and community linkages effectiveness. Indicators of success for the Stay In School Program are three students who have graduated from high school through the Outreach High School and many other students who have completed various courses and returned to the regular school system. An additional indicator has been parents who utilized the Outreach Advocate Program more often in seeking assistance for their children, a sign of both empowerment and available resource networks. 25 A key to the success of the program is the staff, a team of individuals who are committed to the goals and mission of the program, and who are a caring group of professionals. Other key aspects include a solid funding source' (Department of Education), support from the school system administrators, seeking and meeting the needs of students, parents, school and project staff, and maintaining a close, working relationship with community agencies. The need to ensure the continuance of the program in the absence of funding is reflected by specific steps being taken to integrate the approaches and strategies of Stay In School within the school system . Recommendations to others interested in developing a dropout program are to visit other programs, dig for and gather research on dropout programs, read and synthesize the information pertinent to the location, and attend the national at\u00ad risk conferences. -------------------------------~~- ~- Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Shelton, Washington Skokomish Indian Tribe Project PRASE: Primary Reservation Alcohol and Substance Education Multidimensional Curriculum Contact: Gerald B. Miller, Director Skokomish Indian Tribe N. 80 Tribal Center Road Shelton, Washington 98584 (206) 426-4232 Focus Group: At-risk Native American youth, ages 10-14 years. Feature: Instructional curriculum kit designed with a wide range of learning situations in mind -substance abuse, grief/loss/trauma, coping skills, peer pressure, and physical/sexual abuse. Program Description: The absence of a substance abuse curriculum with an American Indian emphasis, particularly focused on western Washington tribal culture, was seen as a serious deficit for teaching and working with Indian children. Gerald B. Miller, Project PRASE Director, sought out a concerned and dedicated group of people who shared the vision of developing a culturally relevant substance abuse curriculum for Indian children. The planning team consisted of the director, curriculum developer, youth activity coordinator, curriculum assistant, and several other members from the tribal community. Working together to develop strong, culturally 26 sensitive materials, the planning team and project staff established a curriculum based on traditional Native American styles of teaching, using oral, written and hands-on activities featuring characters of Native American legends. The PRASE Multidimensional Curriculum embodies principles which successful educators have\u00b7long known and practiced: problems related to substance abuse are not isolated to the home, but are felt in the. classroom and lives of individual children; su.ccessful approaches combine a variety of teaching strategies that are multisensory and interactive; teachers face children with extended emotional problems and needs on a daily basis; and through use of traditional wisdom and culture, American Indian children can more easily recognize their own situations. Originally developed for rural Indian children, project PRASE has proven to be successful and popular with non\u00ad Indian children as well. The wide range of learning situations incorporated into the curriculum serves to reach a great number of children, gaining access to issues relevant to all. Through video and written material, \"Raccoon's; Feast\" teaches the importance of helping others recover from substance abuse by Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities showing supportive and caring attitudes, and that drugs are not needed to have a good time, especially at traditional events. \"The Saddest Day\" presents traditional Native ways of coping with the losses that disrupt a student's foundation of well-being. Confronting physical and sexual abuse, \"Bear Hugs\" addresses the issue of confusing touches and how to deal with them. Children learn to have a sense of power and control over their bodies and that it's okay to tell about bad or disturbing things that happen to them. Coping with a substance-abusing parent is effectively confronted through the story of \"Winona's Song.\" Winona shares her sadness with Eagle and Eagle shows her specific coping skills and methods for healing through the traditional therapy of story and song. \"Skunk's Greatest Lesson II furthers the effort to empower children to resist negative peer pressure. In this lesson, Grandfather tells Tara a story about Skunk, who wants to be part of a gang and suffers the consequences of his submission to peer pressure. The curriculum combines myth with ritual to achieve a form of play, which was/is a learning style for traditional Native societies. Project PRASE utilizes two external evaluators for data collection, information synthesis, and evaluation. As funding for the project comes from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, quarterly and yearly progress reports including evaluative data is crucial to the continuance ofthe project. Pre-and posttests are administered to students for assessing the effectiveness of the curriculum content, revealing substantial impact on students' awareness 27 of problems and strategies to cope with their issues. ------ ----- Western Regional center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Poplar, Montana Assiniboine/Sioux Indian Nations Adolescent Residential Aftercare Program Spotted BuH Treatment Center Contact: Kar6ii Brown, Director Spotted Bull Treatment Center P.O. Box 1027 Poplar, Montana 59255 (406) 768-3852 Focus Group: who have completed inpatient treatment. Feature: Provide an aftercare residential treatment program for adolescents at a minimum of 90 days to 6 months, incorporating a traditional medical, psychological, and spiritual philosophy. Program Description: Indian Health Services (IHS) conducted an assessment of Spotted Bull Treatment Center in January of 1990, which revealed the severe need for an adolescent component to the treatment center due to the high number of adult repeaters to the inpatient treatment program. Until July of 1989, Spotted Bull was an adult treatment center, at which time there became a split focus of service seeking to attend to both adults and adolescents. Following the 1990 IHS assessment, the focus of the treatment center was directed towards an adolescent aftercare program. 28 Incorporating a collaborative process in planning and providing service, Spotted Bulllg adolescent program involves a variety of agencies and programs from the reservation. Tribal government and other tribal programs, families, ju~icial and law enforcement departments, media, religious organizations, the school system, social services and other treatment agencies are involved. Through collaborative partnerships and relationships, an effective delivery of service by the staff of Spotted Bull is enhanced and strengthened, resulting in more agencies and programs involved in the well .. being of the individual and family. Basing the philosophy oftreatment in traditional medical, psychological, and spiritual points of view, the program emphasizes that an individual is one who has a workable system of values and meaningfhl sense of connection and relation to aspects of life outside the narrow bounds of self. Everyone has this potential for wellness and the Adolescent Aftercare Program provides a program to help each person achieve their potential. Services provided through the program include group therapy sessions held on a daily basis, focusing on self concept, self Western Regional center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities awareness, and group interaction. The goal of group therapy is to build the client's trust in self and others. Weekly individual counseling sessions are held with an assigned counselor, who monitors the progress of the client. Educational lectures are presented daily on the psychological, physical, social and spiritual effects of alcohol and other drugs upon the individual and family. Recreational ther~py provides clients with opportunities to develop an enhanced ability to use social and recreational resources in the community including evening Alcoholics Anonymous meetings held weekly in the two major reservation districts. \"Eye Opener\" sessions held daily are intended to provide residents with a positive attitude for each day; and 24-hour staff coverage is provided to ensure appropriate levels of supervision and care. A traditionallspiritualleader works with the adult/adolescent programs implementing the traditional/spiritual aspect on the family cultural values and beliefs of the clients. This leader implements the teaching/educating of the traditional/spiritual ways to program staff and community, schools and other organizations. The 12 traditional steps are implemented with the sweat lodge for those clients culturally oriented. An additional service aspect is a family counselor, who works with families that have been identified as needing a structured family program. The counselor conducts family groups using alcohol and other drug-related material, and works closely with the traditional spiritual leader. Program evaluation is documented through program reviews, quarterly 29 reports, and case management documentation. Follow-up assessment of adolescents involved in the residential aftercare program reveals a high percentage have increased the length of their sobriety. Keys to the success of the program are having a staff with two years or more of sobriety, a commitment to improving services, and developing a well\u00ad represented community alliance to ensure a wider range of service and assistance to clients and their families. --------- ---- Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Kake, Alaska Tlinget and Haida Native Corporations Annual Cultural Camp Contact:\u00b7 Cheryl J. Evan, Coordinator Education Department Organized Village students Feature: An eight-day campout style retreat offering day campers and overnighters the opportunity to participate in activities of cultural significance, with an emphasis upon living healthier lives free of substance abuse. Program Description: In its fourth year of operation, the Annual Cultural Camp represents the culmination of effort and collaboration of the Organized Village ofKake's education department, Johnson O'Malley Program, and the educational parent committee, who all saw the need for an extended event which would provide the youth with a healthy and culturally rich environment. From the roots of involvement in 1989, the planning team has grown to incorporate a number of agencies, people and programs with the Organized Village ofKake. Local businesses, tribal government and other 30 tribal programs, the school system, judicial and law enforcement agencies, health and social services, religious organizations, media, families, and many more, all play an active part in organizing, offering resources and assistance, and operating the camp out. It has become a truly unique community empowerment project. The Organized Village ofKake is located on an island southwest of Juneau which requires the entire community to work collaboratively together for the camp out and other events. The activities and structure of the week\u00ad long event provide the participants with a rich experience. The camp begins on a Saturday in July when youth and adults work together in setting up the camp site, which includes clean up, repairing existing structures, chopping wood, pitching tents, and filleting and smoking of halibut and salmon. Each day begins with a 5:30 AM wake-up ~all, when work begins on starting or maintaining the smokehouse, hanging filleted strips of salmon or halibut in the smokehouse, and getting breakfast ready, just in time for the arrival of all the daycampers. A major aspect .of the campout is that the participants are responsible for all meals, including the preparation, cooking, serving, and clean up, which serves to stimulate collaboration and responsibility to others. Activities for the participants ------------ ---------------~--'--\"'---------...-..I Western Regional center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities include swimming, hiking, storytelling, guest speakers, canning, repairing forest trails, and various cultural games. On a particular day, participants might repair a stream dam, dig a fire pit and gather wood, pick wild asparagus and elderberries, learn how to make paint and tools, strip cedar bark to weave bracelets, clean and cut bear, salmon, seal, and octopus, and paint family crests. Throughout the week-long activity is woven the constant message of healthy living, free of substance abuse. The youth participants engage in discussions with a variety of speakers and topics, providing a great opportunity to teach and learn from each other on a wide range of topics. These topics range from learning about the impact logging has on the environment and what's being done to curb that impact, to gaining insight to medical, health and law enforcement careers. Presentations on alcohol and other drug issues range from youth groups to family dynamics. A representative from Raven's Way, a program for troubled and misguided youth in Sitka, discusses the program and how it works with the juvenile judicial system in Kake. Several elders and young adults speak from a personal . viewpoint about the impact alcohol has had on their own lives and the lives of family and friends close to them. Many of the youth become involved with a cultural song and dance group, the Keex' K WdM Dancers, as they practice their drumming, singing and dancing nightly around the fire. Evaluation forms are filled out on a daily basis by all youth, adult chaperones, and guest speakers. Information is utilized to guide the planning for the following 31 year's event. Youth have indicated experiencing growth in understanding more about subsistence living, alcohol and other drug impact on families and communities, and gaining. new friendships. A key component of the Cultural Campot;1t is the need to seek out and obtain full support from the community members and agencies, to ensure a well-rounded experience for the youth. An indicator of success is that the camp out has led to a easing of tensions surrounding issues of turfism and barriers to collaboration within the community. J ----------------------- - Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Klamath Falls, Oregon Klamath Tribes Partnership For A Drug Free Klamath County Contact: Alison Ball, Program Manager Partnership For A Drug Free Klamath County 10501 Washburn Way Klamath Falls, OR. 97603 (503) 884-3786 1-800-642-2169 Focus Group: All members residing in the boundaries of Klamath County. Feature: A partnership of agencies and organizations working together to develop a comprehensive short and long\u00ad range plan for a county wide coordinated approach to alcohol and other drug prevention and wellness promotion. Program Description: Funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), the Partnership for a Drug Free Klamath County (PDFKC) is designed to build an effective county\u00ad wide alliance of agencies and organizations with the specific aim of reducing the incidence of alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse-related issues. The goals of the Partnership are to: establish a county-wide partnership of agencies and organizations; educate and train youth, families, providers, professionals and the county at large about alcohol and other drug (AOD) 32 prevention, abuse, resources, and positive alternatives to AOD abuse; and strengthen leadership among teens, and the county population at large to create positive alternatives to AOD abuse and promote a healthy lifestyle. After extensive assessment and data collection, the members of the Partnership focused on four risk factors in developing the long-range strategic plan: 1) parental involvement in crime, and alcohol and other drugs; 2) low commitment to school; 3) early first use of substances; and 4) community laws and norms favorable toward use. Through the assessment process, the Partnership has completed a plan to measure impact on the four risk factors through a system of tracking eleven baseline indicators. From the beginning, the effort to organize a comprehensive representation of the community has been the major priority for building a collaborative partllership. With the Klamath Tribe serving as lead agency in the Partnership, they have successfully recruited, nurtured and maintained the involvement of 43 agencies. With the focus of the first two years on coalitioll buildillg, the Partnership has achieved remarkable diversity in its membership through prevention training events, retreats, and other strategies to deal directly with and overcome internal conflict. Utilizing consensus building for the decision ----------~-------~~----\" Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities making process is an effective strategy for maintaining high levels of participation by providing all members an opportunity for input in decision making. This process makes it difficult for a few members or groups to dominate the interaction, forcing problematic issues into the open and providing a forum for resolution. The Partnership has four organizational components: 1) the PDFKC Steering Committee, responsible for directing the PDFKC; 2) the Partnership staff, including a program manager, substance abuse prevention coordinator, and a secretary, who provide assistance to the steering committee; 3) the Klamath Tribes who, as lead agency, are responsible for the administration of the CSAP grant; and 4) an extensive committee structure, responsible for implementing the program, and which relies on a number of internal groups to operate program activities. The committees have been formed to address issues and develop strategies for strategic planning, the youth, developmental dollars, media, multicultural, bylaws, and conflict management. Training for the Partnership is provided by Seabert Associates, Klamath County area experts, and CSAP. Committee building, coalition training, team building, consensus building and facilitation skills, grant writing, conflict resolution, adolescent parent training~ preschool parent training, junior high youth peer helper training retreats, are some of the trainings sponsored and attended by the Partnership. Assessment of the Partnership is under the management of an outside evaluator 33 from Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. Proces!)' evaluation includes minutes from Partnership meetings, observations of meetings, quarterly self\u00ad assessments, evaluation of trainings, retreats, and activities, and interviews with Partnership and key community members. Outcome evaluation activities involve the careful monitoring of ADD Indicators established from baseline data in the community profile. Indicators of success include: the commitment of 41 agencies and organizations to be involved in the Partnership; trainings and activities which have been well attended and proven effective; Partnership meetings that have been appropriately scheduled to allow for maximum attendance; and a newsletter published and distributed by the Partnership Which generates tremendous awareness of the Partnership, substance abuse issues in the county, activities and trainings open to the community, and documents successful stories and events occurring as a result of the Partnership. Key aspects to the success of the Partnership include a substantial effort in developing skills for coalition building, networking, and conflict resolution. This has led to the successful involvement of the various agencies and organizations in Klamath County. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Hoopa Valley, California Hoopa, Yurok, and Karok Indian Nations Bright Futures Project Contact: Norma Jean Pole, Coordinator Bright Futures Project P.O, Box 1364 Hoopa, California 95546 (916) 625-4337 Focus Group: Students enrolled in the Klamath-Trinity Unified School District and their families, with an emphasis on students in transition between 8th and 10th grades. Feature: A collaborative partnership providing students and families with a comprehensive program of activities, support, leadership opportunities, wellness promotion, and schooll community relationship development. Program Description: A survey administered in early 1992 revealed a tremendous need to develop a more collaborative relationship between the school system, and the community it serves. Particularly disturbing to the community was the very high drop-out rate among eighth to tenth grade students, as well as feelings of animosity between school and community. It was determined that a program of support was needed for the students of concern and that there was a need to begin the development of a comprehensive program addressing the needs of the 34 community and school system. Norma Pole, Bright Futures Project Coordinator began meeting with the high school principal and, together, they formed a planning team consisting of representatives from the school, Indian Health Services, Hoopa Health Association, churches, youth groups, and parent organizations. In working together the group developed a Wellness\u00b7 Planning Council as the collaborative entity dedicated to addressing the issues raised from the assessment survey. Collaborative partnership building is vital to the program's concept in order to help the community and youth to feel empowered to see their own needs and work together toward solutions. Training provided by the Wellness Planning Council and offered to the community focused on facilitation skills, prevention, awareness, community empowerment, developing partnerships, networking and collaboration. The Council also provided training for the youth in substance abuse awareness, peer helpers, cross ... age tutoring, mentorship, support groups and empowerment. In developing a strategic plan, the Wellness Planning Council established several goals and objectives focusing on three components: the school, individuallpeer.~, and family. Results of the strategic plan have been the Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities establishment of a School Oimate Committee, which includes several students; creation of a transition program for 8th grade students in feeder schools; student involvement activities such as a peer helping program, youth advisory groups, a teen court; and plans to create a student radio program. Other strategies include a complete review of school procedures to ensure that a clear alcohol/drug policy is in effect and establishing a student services center to provide assistance to students with personal and family issues. Another important strategy is to develop community prevention planning councils in each of the targeted communities in an effort to build a more comprehensiv,e collaborative approach to helping all children, families and their communities on issues relative to substance abuse. Key aspects to the success experienced thus far include eh,1:ensive effort to gain the involvement of key people from various agencies, working together in a truly collaborative process, and meeting the needs of a planning group with effective training and skill development in order to empower agency personnel to work more efficiently in meeting the needs of a community. 35 Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Salem, Oregon Various Northwest and Alaska Native Tribes Chemawa Alcoholism Education Center Contact: John Spence, Ph.D. Program Director Chemawa Alcoholism Education (503) 399-5942 Focus Off-reservation boarding school students, grades nine through twelve. Feature: A campus-wide student assistance program serving high school students with assessment, intervention, prevention, drug education, treatment and outdoor recreation therapy. Program Description: Operating on the campus of Chemawa Indian Boarding School, the Chemawa Alcoholism Education. Center (CAEC) was established in 1971 to assist students on campus with alcohol and other drug\u00ad related problems. Chemawa Indian Boarding School, founded in 1880, is one of five remaining off-reservation boarding schools which serve federally recognized tribes. Students in grades 9- 12, mostly from the Northwest states and Alaska, attend Chemawa. Formal and informal surveys were administered to Chemawa Indian School board and school staff during the 1985-86 school year. The results indicated a high 36 percentage of alcohol and other drug (AOD) incidents among the student population and indicated a high level of need for an AOD prevention/intervention program. A planning team consisting of school board members and school staff began the process of assessing and prioritizing needs and strategies. While the first several years of CAEC focused on detoxification and crisis intervention, the planning team sought out strategies to shift the program focus. The result has been the development of a program that provides high quality, culturally sensitive outpatient services: assessment, intervention, prevention, drug education, treatment, and outdoor recreation therapy. Through a collaborative effort CAEe has fonned critical community alliances with several agencies and organizations. The Oregon State Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Prevention, Salem-Keizer Together, Primary Residential Treatment Programs, and Bureau of Indian Affairs Social Services form the collaborative network which supports and provides services to the CAEC program. Funded through a contract with the Indian Health Services. (IRS), Chemawa Alcohol Education Center has a staff of nine, including an intervention specialist, three counselors and two recreation therapists. Western Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Chemawa Alcohol Education Center program offers several service components and activities. Individual and group counseling includes the initial assessment required for all alcohol and other drug incidents, an eight-week misuse level group, a 16-week abuse level group, an aftercare setting for Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, and a 30-45 day inpatient treatment referral to Primary Residential Treatment. Recreation therapy addresses the healing process through safe, playful interaction designed to generate experiences of support, trust and joy. Activities include challenge course, white water rafting, and snow skiing. Cultural activities include Prayer Circles, Talking Circles, Sweat Lodge ceremonies, and an annual Pow-wow held in the fall and spring. Prevention activities include many alcohol and other drug-free alternative events provided for students, such as Sobriety Dances, youth workshops, Oregon Teen Institute, and Natural Helpers. Positive reinforcement is also provided through Sobriety Recognition Banquets, certificates, medallions, key chains, movie passes, T-shirts, jackets, sobriety birthday cakes, and the earning of \"Big Bucks\" which can be used at the campus snack bar. Some training activities have been provided through the collaborative relationship with Salem-Keizer Together and the Oregon State Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Programs. In addition the CAEC staff attended the 1986-87 National Children of Alcoholics Conference held in Los Angeles, California. Other trainings include Oregon Teen Leadership Institute, Oregon Prevention Resource Center, and 37 Northwest Indian Council on Chemical Dependency. Evaluating the program's success involves the assessment of monthly lists of substance abuse violations and a Quality Assurance Survey of student satisfaction with the program administered on a quarterly basis. A powerful indicator of success comes directly from the monthly substance abuse violations list which shows the number of violations has been reduced by over two-thirds since the 1985.:86 school year. Actual numbers reflecting this reduction are 1,486 AOD incidents in 1985-86 to 403 incidents in 1992-93. Keys to success begin with the recognition of the problem by the Chemawa School Board, a commitment to work towards a Drug-Free school and the adoption of school policies supportive of this commitment. The support offered by the school board has been the key in overcoming the obstacles of staff and tribal community enabling, as well as a lack of understanding of substance abuse by both Indian Health Service headquarters and National Tribal Leadership. A well-trained staff committed to supporting a well-defined mission for the improvement of the health of youth is the foundation for the program's success .and impact upon individual lives.

Feature: A comprehensive alcohol and other drug program serving 1,500 students by incorporating prevention, intervention, assessment and referral, training, and community involvement. Program Description: A 1989 assessment revealed the need for a stronger, more comprehensive student assistance program to reach all students involved in educational programs on the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation. In response to the assessment, the Turtle Mountain Community Prevention Network planning team was formed to bring together a strong community alliance of agencies and community leaders. Twenty three agencies and individuals are involved in the collaborative Network, which serves as a forum to discuss mutual concerns, formulate strategies, and develop action plans. A significant step in the planning process has been the adoption of the Network's program mission, goals and 40 objectives, and strategies for implementation into the Turtle Mountain Tribal Strategic Action Plan. The activities of the Tribal Strategic Action Plan are comprehensive in nature and demonstrate a commitment by the tribe to promote wellness throughout the entire tribal.community. Program activities entail the following four components: 1) Prevention Education-K-12 AOD Curriculum; 2) Early Interventiqn--assessment and referral for services; 3) Training-a five-year training plan for the school system's addiction counselors; and 4) Community Support and Involvement-active interaction between the Prevention Network and community prevention activities. Although the focus of the program is on the school system, it promotes a variety of activities and events that reach out to the entire Reservation community. Training for the staff and community has included fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects, and their impact upon a family and school system. Program staff, in particular the addiction counselors, undertook a nine-month practicum course of study-a six-month inpatient and three-month outpatient focus. The addictions counselor trainees must have the required coursework completed prior ------------------------~----~~--~~~ Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities to training and must pass written and oral examinations. Training and instructional services have been provided through a collaborative partnership with tbe consortiums of James River and Lake Region Human Services Center. Evaluation of the program includes data collection in the school system to reflect ADD incidents by category, grade, number of students involved, referrals to treatment, students in aftercare, and number of sessions with parents/community. An ongoing system of assessing the trainings and community support/involvement entails onsite evaluations of participant numbers, demographic information, and event appraisal. The evaluations serve to assist the Network planning team to effectively strategize for the next year. Keys to success include having a vision that a single agency working alone will not be as effective as organizations working collaboratively; recognizing the need to effectively train addiction counselors to help them assist students more professionally; and enlisting key community leaders to overcome resistance to efforts of change and forming community alliances. 41 Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Gresham, Wisconsin Menominee Indian Tribe TRAILS: Testing Realities and Investigating Lifestyles Contact: Renee Wilber Maehnowesekiyah Treatment Center N4587 County G Gresham, Wisconsin 54128 (715) 199-3835 Focus Group: Children and youth five to eighteen years of age. Feature: A drug abuse prevention program providing youth with educational and recreational activities richly invested with Menominee culture and tradition. Program Description: Beginning in 1975, the Menominee Indian Tribe conducted a comprehensive health survey to determine community needs. The results, which revealed wide use of substances among teenagers, prompted the tribe to seek and receive funding from the state of Wisconsin to st~rt the TRAILS program. Renee Wilber, Prevention Coordinator for the Menominee Tribe, recruited and obtained the involvement of a collaborative planning team made up of the Tribal Planner, counselors, adolescent health coordinator, nurses, and Maehnowesekiyah's system manager and agency director. The planning team worked diligently to develop the program and various strategies. In designing the 42 prevention program, the planning team recognized the need to build upon and strengthen children's pride in their Menominee heritage and themselves before substance abuse prevention could occur. Training for the staff and community has been facilitated through a collaborative relationship with the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Together with the planning team, the University assesses the needs of staff and community members to effect.ively design training modules with an emphasis on prevention. Training topics include: Prevention Right From the Start, Gang Intervention, Inhalent Abuse, Child Abuse and Neglect, and BABES (Beginning Alcohol and Addictions Basic Education ~tudies). Effective tral\\ning and diligent work has empowered the staff to develop age-appropriate material and activities ingrained with healthy living messages. Some of the activities offered through the program include eight youth groups per week, provided for five to 18 year oIds, facilitated by trained staff, and once-a-month Family Nights, which encourage family members to gather together and share an evening of activities and discussion. Through well established collaborative community Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities alliances, the various agencies are inv01ved in sending and receiving referrals, volunteering time and services, and sharing time and space for the purpose of offering a wide range of activities and support services. Monitoring program progress includes collecting data generated from parent surveys, intake forms in each agency relative to services connected to the TRAILS network, monthly newsletter mailings, and activity attendance rates. Indications of progress and success include high referrals to the program, increased parent involvement with their children, and participant feedback via the newsletter's topic page, which attests to increased awareness levels of the program and substance abuse-related Issues. Extensive planning and age-appropriate materials are the keys to TRAILS' success. Additionally, program stafflive on the reservation and are known throughout its system as trustworthy and dedicated to the needs of the community. One major conflict arose when TRAILS group meetings were held at the same time as other activities. This problem was resolved by scheduling the group meetings around the various activities. Planning ... Planning ... Planning is the bottom line when making recommendations to other areas wanting to develop any system of community prevention and intervention. Without planning and involving a myriad of agencies, TRAILS would not be experiencing the success it has today. 43 Midwest Regional Center for Drug-~ree Schools and Communities Gresham, Wisconsin Menominee Indian Tribe School Intervention Program Contact: Marla Barger-Rhoads, Counselor Coordinator Maehnowesekiyah Wisconsin 54128 (715) 799-3835 Focus Group: Junior and senior high school students. Feature: A program that provides service and opportunity for adolescents who require or desire greater support and assistance to achieve success in school, particularly in providing support groups as needed. Program Description: A January 1993 assessment of junior and senior high students revealed an unusually large number of student suspensions and expUlsions in the Menominee Indian School District. In response to the assessment results, a planning team from the School District and Maehnowesekiyah Treatment Center worked together with students and families to develop an action plan to help identify problems and modify behavior, thereby assisting the student to work at his/her maximum potential. The planning team consisted of Maehnowesekiyah Treatment Center's Director, Counselor Coordinator, Residential Counselor, Case Manager, and Adolescent Counselor, along with 44 Menominee Indian School District's Superintendent, high school Principal\u00ad Guidance Counselor, and In School Suspension Program Coordinator. Though relatively new to the community and school system, the School Intervention Program has already served to bring various factions of the community together for the purpose of uniting efforts toward a shared goal-helping youth lead more productive and healthy lives. The underlying philosophy of the program seeks to empower the students to work to their full potential, thereby strengthening the community's growth and understanding of its traditional social values. The School Intervention Program components entail a six-week open-ended program, meeting twice per week on school grounds, and family sessions conducted every other Saturday through the Treatment Center. Based on information gathered, an action plan with specifically defined goals is developed and agreed upon between the ,student and counselor. Through the Maehnowesekiyah Treatment Center the groups confront and discuss issues such as peer pressure, communication, assertiveness/feelings and defenses, positive self-talk, adolescent health, alcohol and other drug abuse, and' anger cue/time outs. Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Developing a community alliance among various agencies and programs provides the foundation for success of the program as each alliance member contributes service support and referrals. Joining the Treatment Program and School District are Family Services, Juvenile Justice/Court System, Law Enforcement Department, Social Services, and Tribal Human Resources. Without the collaborative support and assistance, the program would be difficult to operate. Funding for the School Intervention Program is provided through Tribal sources. Monitoring progress involves data collection from a student's social history and individualized action plan, in addition to minutes from Team meetings held by the high school and Maehnowesekiyah Treatment Center. An immediate indicator of success was fewer student referrals to the principal per month following the implementation of the program. The key to success for the School Intervention Program was developing a team approach and actively promoting community alliances among agencies. Also, implementing community service programs is proving to be very important to the youth. 45 ----------------~-~~~---.~~~-----------------------_. -----~------- Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Flandreau, South Dakota Twenty~Six Tribal Nations Flandreau Indian School Contact: Jack Belkham, Superintendent Flandreau Indian School 1000 N. Crescent Flandreau, South Dakota 57028 (605) 997-2724 Focus Group: Off-reservation boarding school students in grades nine through twelve. Feature: A proactive, multifaceted alcohol/substance abuse counseling program provided by a certified counseling staff to a student population of 600, representing 26 different tribes. Program Description: Through self-disclosure on a personal history questionnaire, 90 percent of the students enrolled at Flandreau revealed that they came from homes where alcohol is a problem. The dysfunctional environment in which these children live has hindered their decision-making skills, leading to their own development of substance abuse patterns. Records from the 1992-93 school year indicated that approximately 120 students were disciplined for use of a substance. The needs of Flandreau students were clear, as was the need to respond. In response to the issues revealed, Flandreau Indian School developed a counseling program utilizing collaborative working relationships 46 with off-campus agencies and services. A planning team of on-and off-campus Counselors, Counseling Technicians, and dormitory personnel began meeting to determine appropriate steps to develop in order to meet the needs being expressed by the students. Providing the framework of the counseling program are three objectives: 1) Identify and place students in the school's AOD program; 2) Provide access for all students to a comprehensive health education program; and 3) Implement group support systems for education, prevention, and coping skills. Through the planning process and involvement with off-campus agencies, the planning team established and implemented several strategies to carry out the mission and objectives of the counseling program. On-campus adolescent support groups provided on a weekly basis include Alateen, Alanon, and Teens Need to Talk. Off-campus services include weekly AA and Alateen meetings, with transportation to and from sessions provided by the school system. Another component involves large group alcohol and other drug-free activities provided to all students on a monthly basis. Students are asked to sign contracts to remain alcohol and other drug-free forattendart.::e to the large group activities. ------------~~ ------------------------------------------------- Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Evaluating the counseling program includes data collected from yearly informal assessments, new student self\u00ad disclosure survey, and monthly alcohol/drug incident reports. Records and information show that the alcohol/drug usage is declining on a yearly basis, as are behavioral referrals to the discipline program. Key comp01lents to success indicated by the staff of Flandreau Indian School include care, concern, and consistency: provide the care and counseling for those in need, be concerned about those students not involved with substances, and be consistent-do what you say you are going to do. A recommendation for other schools is, do not wait for that IIperfect program, II as it's not out there and procrastination will only delay services to the children. Develop a program through collaborative networking of services and II go after it.

Supervisor Winnebago Department of Health and Human Services P.O. Box 636 Black River Falls, Wisconsin 54615 (608) 784-3083 Focus Group: Youth, ages twelve to eighteen, residing throughout fourteen counties. Feature: A prevention program providing activities on a daily basis in the areas of education, culture, recreation, and social avenues of development Program Description: The need for a youth activities program was revealed through a community-wide survey administered in 1990. Responding to this urgent need to provide assistance to the youth at risk for substance abuse, a planning team, consisting of the tribe's Mental Health and Health Directors, Health Education Director, and the Alcohol and Drug Program Director convened to begin the planning process. The initial goal of the planning team was to develop a collaborative partnership among the various agencies that work closely with youth and their families in order to provide a comprehensive array of services and activities. The broader the partnership network, the more effective the reach would become in assessing the 48 needs and appropriating the necessary servIces. The Winnebago Youth Services Program provides activities that are sequenced on a daily basis to provide a different prevention focus for the youth each day. Youth Service Coordinators are responsible for carrying out the scope of work relative to the activities. Over the course of a five-day period, the youth are involved in recreational, cllltural, educational, physical fitness, and leadership activities. Recreational activities involve youth in swimming, basketball, volleyball, softball, and other seasonal games. Cultural activities include storytelling, arts and crafts, and language development. Biking, walking, jogging, rope-skipping, and aerobic exercise are part of the physical fitness activities employed to build up body and health awareness. The educational focus utilizes films, videos, various curricula, guest speakers and group discussions on a variety of topics. Youth learn about leadership through participation in a Youth Council. During meetings, they plan and approve Youth Council activities or establish special projects and programs. Additional activities include community service projects and fundraising to attend UNITY 2000 Conferences each year. Special events, such as attending the UNITY Conference and Mass Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Communications Camp, are offered twice a year and are held as special incentives for the youth. Training for staff members is coordinated through a collaborative partnership with the University of Wisconsin. Areas of training include adolescent alcohol and other drug abuse prevention strategies, peer pressure, decision-making skills, team building, and conflict management. Evaluating the progress of the program entails data collection on the number of activities, type of activities, number of participants, percentage breakdown of male/female participants, and parent and family involvement. This information is utilized as a planning tool to assess the levels and type of participation in activities and which activities produce the most involvement from the youth and their families. The key to success in this type of program is directly related to the collaborative partnerships established within the community. Funding, which comes from Indian Health Services, is also a key aspect of a successful program. 49 I\u00b7mdwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Tribe Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention\u00ad Intervention of American Indian Youth Contact: Glory A. Allen, Project Director Family Resource Center -L.D.F. Chippewa Tribe 450 Old Abe Rd. Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin 54538 (715) 588-3303 Focus Group: Families with children ages four years and older. Feature: A community-based alcohol and other drug prevention and intervention program, specifically a bi\u00ad cultural approach, using the Ojibwe language, history, and cultural teachings unique to the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa Tribe and reservation. Program Description: A 1983 community survey offamilies on the Lac du Flambeau reservation revealed the need for a community-based alcohol and other drug abuse prevention and intervention program, specifically a bi-cultural approach working with the entire and/or extended family, using Ojibwe language, history, and cultural teachings. The survey respondents overwhelmingly supported the idea of such a prevention and intervention program. The planning team-community agency representatives and individual reservation members-worked collaboratively to 50 begin formulating an action plan to address the expressed needs of the community. Their initial step was to obtain funding from the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, then to establish a program staff and advisory board. The project stat/includes a Director, Assistant Director and Project Secretary, responsible for overall administrative activities and planning; an Outreach Coordinator, who conducts in-home visits and provides referral assistance to additional services; a Children's Coordinator, responsible for conducting all children's groups for ages four through 12 years and assisting with adolescent groups; an Elders' Activities Coordinator, who conducts grandparent groups and assists in the elders' outreach component and Elders' Resource Council; an Ojibwe Language Coordinator/Instructor, responsible for directing the Elders' Resource Council and teaching the Ojibwe language to various groups; and a Media Consultant, who works with the Director in public relations. A Project Advisory Board was formed to provide guidance and advice to review the eight program components. Activities are cultural in focus and serve to promote family gathering and communication. Each year, since 1983, Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities twenty-five different families have participated in a twenty-four-week family curriculum model, in addition to weekly cultural gatherings at the Round House. In an attempt to revitalize cultural identity and awareness in 1984 the ceremonial Round House began to be used on a more regular basis for traditional ceremonies and gatherings. The Round House has become a central aspect\u00b7 of the prevention-intervention programming strategies bringing families together in a positive manner. The Family Circles component of the program serves to develop and maintain collaborative inter-agency linkages with programs and services vital to families and their children. The networking relationships with 'Tribal Human Services, Family Resource Center, Chippewa Health Center, Lac du Flambeau Public Grade School, Lakeland Union High School, and Tribal Governme~t are proving very effectiv~ in developing a project newsletter, monthly feasts, co-sponsoring sobriety Pow\u00ad wows, run/walk events, Round House events, and presentations for a variety of community groups. Training for project staff includes yearly continuing education and advanced degree work, since all staff members hold B.S. degrees in social work. Other aspects of training include identifYing five different communities per year to receive' intensive Ojibwe language instruction. The use of the traditional Ojibwe language allows participants to achieve greater and more complex levels of self\u00ad expression, along with a greater sense of self-esteem, accomplishment, and group tribal belonging. Traditioltal culture provides a base and gives d.irection and 51 substance for self-identity and self\u00ad esteem needed for healthy living to counteract alcoholism. Project staff state clearly, IIIn the anatomy of the Ojibwe culture the language is the fiber, die genetics, and the skin that unifies it and lends it its beauty. II The Talking Circle format is utilized with the Family Circles activity, as well as with project staff meetings, which allow and encourage members to openly share thoughts, feelings, and concerns in an uninterrupted manner. Evaluation utilizes two primary systems of record-keeping maintained for process and outcome evaluation purposes. The Project Management Plan Charts and Weekly Project Component Activity Forms are used to monitor and record the necessary information. In addition, individual and family folders are maintained for each project participant to help track involvement and progress. A major finding of the process evaluation revealed that hiring staff who actively practice the values and behaviors espoused in the program is an important factor in the success of the Family Circles component. Data results show the impact and effectiveness of the program upon families completing the program. A major accomplishment of the project has been the completion of project goals and work plans during the three years of a five-year grant. A recommendation for others interested in a similar program is to. visit the Family Resource Center in Lac du Flambeau. Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Sc\\)ools and Communities Mt.

Pleasant, Michigan 48858 (517) 772-5700 Focus Group: All members of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe and other eligible Native Americans through the local Tribal Health Department. Feature: A comprehensive program that provides screening and assessment, community education and prevention, outpatient il t:nCInent and aftercare, and residential youth rehabilitation. Program Description: A 1979 community survey revealed a need for the health programs servicing the reservation community to become more unified and collaborative in nature in order to provide more effective service. Community members felt that the system was disjointed and needed an overall effort to move toward a wholistic system that both compliments and assists the individual programs operating within the framework to become more effective. Several key members of the community took a lead role in developing a well\u00ad represented planning team to address the need to form collaborative partnerships among agencies and programs. Individuals from tribal 52 government and other tribal programs, family services, tribal court and law enforcement systems, religious organizations, health and social services, the tribal education department, and the school system (public and alternative) committed their time, energy, and resources to the planning efforts to develop a comprehensive and wholistic community system of health-related services. With substance abuse identified as the single most devastating factor to Indian communities, the planning team was able to focus its effort on wellness promotion and the need to get through barriers to collaboration, such as turfism and denial. The lifeblood of the prevention effort has been the work of a number of healthy, sober \"movers and shakers,\" who have provided clarity and focus for the planning team. The overall Substance Abuse Program is administered by a Substance AbuselMental Health Administrator responsible for managing all health programs for the Tribe. Services are provided in four areas, each having additional personnel to assist in operation of specific programs. The four service areas are: 1) screening and assessments; 2) community education and prevention; 3) outpatient treatment and aftercare; and 4) residential youth rehabilitation. Proper balance and service delivery within and among these four program components are critical to effectively ---- I Midwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities provide families, individuals, and the community with comprehensive health care. A correlational aspect to the program involves the Medicine Wheel perspective on health. The Medicine Wheel engages four areas that must be maintained and effectively interrelated for an individual to be healthy and balanced: Intellectual, Emotional, Physical, Spiritual. When addressing substance abuse and service delivery, programs must incorporate a balance of these four vital components. Emotional well-being is addressed through counseling, learning to deal in a positive way with feelings; the Intellectual well-being through educational programs designed to increase the knowledge base; the Physical well-being through recreational alternatives which celebrate the body's strengths and skills; and the Spiritual well-being through a recognition of a higher power and a relationship with other living things. With the Medicine Wheel in mind, program strategies and activities followed a systemic planning approach in establishing six objectives as the foundation: 1) Provide school-based prevention programs, such as inhalant abuse education; 2) Provide substance abuse education to parents and community through quarterly substance abuse workshops open to all; 3) Conduct passive programming (media campaigns), such as writing and contributing articles for publication in local and regional media; 4) Provide substance abuse alternative activities through the Youth Center, such as hosting cultural workshops open to youth and families, facilitating a Women's Warrior Society for females age 12 and up, assist in forming a young men's 53 group, and implementing a weekly movie night at the Youth Center; 5) Participate in planning of special events, such as the Freedom Walk, Family Unity Conference and Olympics, and Little Elk RetreatlPow wow; 6) Address staff development and networking, including staff meetings, in-service and annual . retreats. Evaluation of the Ojibwe Prevention Plan is reviewed at each regular staff meeting. Staff are required to include their involvement with various activities on monthly narrative reports, which have proven very useful for assessing overall program direction. Units of service provided for prevention and intervention are documented within each service area and shared with the program planning team in assessing collaborative efforts and effectiveness of service delivery. A key aspect of success for the program is the closeness of the community, a kinship and tie to each other that is very strong and significant, allowing people and programs to draw strength from each other. The constant thought that \"the pain of one is the pain of all\" serves to keep a clear focus on efforts. The collaborative partnerships exist and are the foundation of the success of this program.

Feature: After-school alternative activities program, including educational, cultural, and recreational activities, offered to Indian youth and led by positive adult Indian role models. Program Description: The Haliwa-Saponi After-School Youth Program is part of a county and state prevention plan, designed to meet the needs of rural youth by offering alternative positive activities. A tribal community survey was administered in 1985 revealing a strong desire and need for an after-school program targeting high-risk youth, but offered to all youth. Members of the tribal center staff and tribal council discussed the findings and worked collaboratively to develop a plan of seeking funds for and implementing an after-school program. Funding was obtained through High\u00ad Risk Youth Program Funds from the 56 Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1986. The planning team established three components to the after-school program: educational, cultural, and recreational Activities and structure of each component works from a developmentally appropriate and practical standpoint, seeking to generate as much involvement as possible. For the educational component, structured workshops are held once a week, addressing such topics as substance abuse prevention, teen pregnancy prevention, suicide prevention, peer pressure, decision making, self-esteem, and mv prevention. Academic assistance is also provided on an as\u00ad needed basis. Cultural component activities instruct students on the preparation and making of traditional and contemporary Native American arts and crafts, such as different styles of beadwork design, and regalia construction. Workshops and discussions are held to actively engage students in dialogue about the Haliwa\u00ad Saponi Indian Culture, history, drumming, singing, dancing, and Pow\u00ad wow etiquette. The recreational component activities include lacrosse, volleyball, basketball and softball. Workshops address how alcohol and other drugs affect athletic performance, Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities rules and regulations ofthe activity, sportsmanship and good conduct. Recognizing the need for collaboration, the planning team and project staffhave worked hard to establish community alliances with several agencies, programs, and individuals. The alcohol and other drug treatment program provides training and workshops; tribal government provides the facilities and mentors; cultural workshops come from other tribal programs; Family, health and social services provide referral workshops, and resources; media provides news coverage; Title V provides cultural and educational workshops; religious organizations provide speakers and workshops, and the school system works to provide referrals, follow-up, and assistance to the program. Training for the project staffhas been in the areas of substance abuse prevention, youth program coordination, peer pressure, suicide and mv prevention. Staff attend several statewide prevention and wellness-oriented conferences. Evaluation includes data collection from attendance records, youth evaluation sheets, staff monthly/quarterly/annual reports, site visits by area mental health staff, and school records reflecting academic and behavior issues. Indications of success reflected from records show students in the program have a more positive self-identity and awareness about their tribe. As students must maintain a certain grade point average, improvement in this area is documented. The percentage of students staying in school and graduating has increased on a yearly basis. Initial information also indicates a decrease in 57 alcohol-related accidents in the community. One of the keys to success is the community collaboration and sharing of the entire program. Project staff are familiar with the community, which lends to the overall strength of the program. Also, an appropriate activities schedule, providing transportation for the kids, providing alternative activities, and promoting positive peer pressure are aspects of developing success. Recommendations offered to other communities include establishing a realistic budget; recognizing that not all youth will or can be served; being enthusiastic and respectful; establishing clear rules for participants and follow through with consequences and rewards; having a selection process for participants; and actively seeking funding or fundraising avenues through a collaborative effort. Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Summerville, South Carolina Various Tribes EDISTO Connection Contact: Mertice Fourteen- to eighteen\u00ad year-old students. Feature: A centrally managed, comprehensive alcohol and other drug prevention program 'Providing a wide range of activities and experiences focused on building healthy individuals, families and community through tradition; culture, service and leadership development. Program Description: Coming out of a need to develop an organizing structure and overall plan to the varied and sporadic youth programs and events, the EDISTO Connection pulled together several individuals from multiple agencies as a planning team. Janice Oglietti, Director of Prevention Services at Dorchester Alcohol and Other Drug Commission wrote the grant and began the effort of forming EDISTO Connection. Joining Ms. Oglietti were community outreach workers, an adult education teacher, Tribal Council members, and several women from the community. The planning team assessed past and current events targeting youth and began to formulate a strategy to bring them all under one 58 direction or philosophy to provide a framework for operating more effectively. Prior to EDISTO there was no formalized program, only sporadic activities with no apparent mission or direction. The pl~nning team sought to build community alliances and was successful in obtaining the support, involvement and resource donations from many organizations, including tribal government and other programs, family/health/social services, religious organizations, the media, the school system, and various volunteer groups. Activities include youth retreats, annual Red Ribbon Week, monthly meetings for a youth Prevention Club, regular community service activities such as clean-up for the Adopt-a-highway commitment, a summer recreation/culture camp, and various discussion/support groups facilitated by trained stafffrom within the collaborative community alliance. The EDISTO Connection weekend retreat provides the youth with intensive learning experiences through short courses, large and small group discussion, guest speakers and becoming part of a CLAN, which consists offour youth and one adult advisor. The CLAN serves as a home group or base group from which are planned the various activities to participate \"In and follow up. Emphasis is upon teamwork and problem solving, stimulating open discussion about --------------------------------------------------1 Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities substance abuse issues and other topics of concern to youth. Training for the staff is described as being lion the job\" training, with community resource personnel serving as mentors. Outreach workers have attended a number of substance abuse prevention workshops, courses and meetings during the course of a year. Indications of progress come directly from the increasing numbers of people involved and the continued full participation by the youth in programs like the summer recreation/culture week. Keys to successful programming with the EDISTO Connection include the need to approach AOD prevention by attending to the basic, everyday issues that the people deal with. Nurturing and maintaining a patient and persistent staff willing to take risks, and gaining the support of the elders and tribal council, have been crucial links to the success of the program. Although EDISTO Connection started with the youth, adults in the community have become a very strong force of involvement and participation in the prevention movement. Recommendations include not letting the lack of funding keep you from developing a program-EDISTO Connection was initially funded with small, short-term grants and continues today with no funding support for staff. 59 Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Cherokee, North Carolina Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian Nation Cherokee Challenge Contact: T om Hill, Coordinator Cherokee Challenge/Cherokee Center for Family Services P.O. Box 507 Cherokee, North Carolina' 28719 (704) 497-7291 Focus Group: Cherokee students, age nine thirteen. Feature: Fourteen-year-old reservation\u00ad wide adventure-based substance abuse . prevention program Program Description: Serving over 2,000 youth of the 55,000 acre Qualla Boundary, home of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian Nation, the Cherokee Challenge has been successful in building links among all Native American youtlt in the spirit of a common goal-prevention of alcohol and other drug use. Ahead of its time, the Cherokee Center for Family Services assisted in the administration of a self\u00ad confidence and self-esteem survey among elementary students in 1979. The results revealed Cherokee students scored significantly lower in those areas on psychologist-administered tests than students from other geographic and racial backgrounds. A planning team consisting of the school psychologist, parent organization members, and staff from the Cherokee Center for Family 60 Services immediately began laying groundwork for an adult volunteer to run an adventure-based program which has remained totally focused on Cherokee youngsters' esteem needs and risk factors. The planning team eventually grew to include parents, teachers, youth services program representatives, and other social service professionals. The Cherokee Challenge program asserts that through the development of adventur.e-basedskills, youth will learn practical skills for healthy decision making. Approximately 120-160 Cherokee youth are involved in a 12 week adventure-based skill development program. Goals of the program are: 1) reduce the incidence of drug experimentation; 2) reduce the drug abuse risk factors of participating youth; 3) increase protective factors of participating youth; 4) evaluate the effectiveness ofthe program on self\u00ad concept, alienation, and substance abuse. During the 12 weeks, youth are engaged in at least one two-to-three hour meeting per week and a 12 -30 hour outing, wherein problem solving, decision making, risk taking, and issues of substance abuse are confronted and worked on. Activities include work on a Ropes Challenge Course, whitewater canoeing and rafting, backcountry exploration and orientation, and other team/individual challenging activities that Southeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities incorporate group cooperation/management skills and individual risk taking. All staff have received high caliber adventure-based counseling training which has been adapted to the Cherokee cultural point of view. Volunteers receive a wide range of training from the staff: including the concrete skills taught to the students. The Cherokee Challenge is staffed with four people and funded through federal and state funds. Evaluation of the program includes two parts: program monitoring and process evaluation conducted by project staff, and outcome evaluation performed by outside consultants. Process evaluation has three components: 1) on-going monitoring system, 2) implementation analysis 8:nd 3) participant observation and qualitative interviewing. Outcome evaluation also involves three phases: 1) a five year plan involving instrument selection and norming, 2) pre and post\u00ad testing with selected instruments and 3) a matched group experimental design using selected instruments and data collection. Indications of program success are found in the pre-and posttest data which support participant awareness and in increased understanding of the risk and protective factors. Interviews with key informants indicate that attitudes and behaviors among the participating youth demonstrate an increase in self\u00ad awareness and cooperation. The major keys to success have been taking the program to the neighborhoods where the youngsters live and offering a program that takes the youngsters las 61 they arel. Community apathy has proven to be the biggest obstacle. Friendly outreach and perseverance is the key to overcoming the obstacles and educating others. -------~~~-----~~--- ~ --------~-Northeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Jerry Edwards, Director 12 Overton Avenue Sayville, New York 11782 (516) 589-7022 FAX: (516) 589-7894 Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont Northeast Regional Center for Drug-Free schools and Communities Buffalo, New York Various Tribes In Urban Setting Native American Program-Title V Wellness Curriculum Contact: Frances Hill, Program Director Native American Program- Title VlNative American Magnet School 97 West Delevan Buffalo, New York 14223 (716) 888-7044 Focus Group: Students, kindergarten through eighth grade Feature: An urban Native American youth curriculum infusing Native American culture, language, and wellness philosophies into a comprehensive health education program. Program Description: A comprehensive survey was administered in 1989 to students, parents, community members, teachers and service agencies, revealing a high level of concern over youth and parents' use of various substances, and the impact of parental use on children. Assessment also showed the frequency of use was iI1creasing. The need for a comprehensive, school-based substance abuse prevention curriculum addressing the uniqueness of Native Americans was strongly apparent. Mark Basehart, Curriculum Specialist, and Frances Hill, Native American Program Director, met with Indian Center staff and local service 64 agency representatives to address needs and begin planning strategies. In addition to curriculum development, the planning team has established several community alliances wh?,ch have assisted in expanding the comprehensive nature of providing service to youth and their families. Operating within an urban public elementary school of 625 students, the Wellness program seiVices the Native American students who account for over one-third of the student population. The Wellness program is delivered to the Native American students on a \"pull\u00ad out\" basis for 10 out of20 periods per month by grade level. Although functioning on a pull-out basis, the total school is moving toward integrating wellness into the classrooms. Students receive two to three 30-minute sessions per week. Instruction consists of substance abuse and wellness information integrated within a comprehensive health model. Other activities include \"youth\u00ad to-youth\" teaching groups and Talkillg Circles groups to process feelings and thoughts relative to substance abuse issues. The Talking Circle provides a strong setting for students needing support and an outlet for their feelings. Classroom strategies embody wellness as a concept. Cooperative learning is used extensively, and social skills are Northeast Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities constantly reinforced using humor and conviction. Wellness program staff received training in counseling strategies and techniques, comprehensive health curriculum components, and cultural information. Talking Circle leaders are trained to implement COA groups and counseling sessions, while students are trained in the \"youth-to-youth\" teaching format. Evaluation is performed through the administration of an anonymous survey to students in grades four through eight, twice a year. The survey addresses frequency, intensity, and duration of entry-level. drug use among students. A control group is established to assess the impact among Native American students vs. those students not receiving the Wellness curriculum. The results of the survey demonstrate that students involved in the Wellness program exhibit less frequent drug use, healthier behaviors, and projected less use than the control group. The biggest obstacle to the program continues to be denial and a fear of confronting the issues head on. Perseverance, humor, and accentuating the positive help individuals overcome these obstacles-working on the obstacles person to person has provided the best approach to helping people work through the obstacles. Key strategies have included public relations and awareness campaigns, special events open to all, and constant soliciting of parental input to help address resistance. Recommendations offered to others include the need to start small, with manageable initiatives that target specific 65 groups, not entire communities, while maintaining a positive public relations effort. Providing students with methods oflearning to \"say no\" works only if they are provided with avenues and activities to which they can say yes, and strategies that put a challenge in their lives. -------------------------------- Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities - Mike Lowther, Director The University of Oklahoma 555 Constitution, Suite 138 Norman, Oklahoma 73037-0005 (800) 234-7972 FAX: (405) 325-1824 Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schoofs and Communities Oldahoma City, Oklahoma Various Tribes Throughout the Country UNITY: United Indian Tribal Youth Contact: IR.

Feature: A national, non-profit organization serving the leadership of American Indian and Alaska Native youth. Program Description: In its seventeenth year of service, United Indian Tribal Youth (UNITY) is an organization designed to develop leadership, promote self sufficiency, and instill cultural pride among Native youth. Incorporated in April 1976 in Oklahoma, UNITY was formed out of a need to address a nationwide desire to develop the leadership potential and instill attitudes of wellness and healthy living among American Indian/Alaska Native youth. The mission of UNITY is to foster the spiritual, mental, physical, and social development of Native youth and to build a strong, unified and self-reliant Native America through the active involvement of its youth. Over the span of seventeen years, UNITY has sponsored 17 national leadership conferences, conducted a 68 series of youth leadership training sessions, and assisted in the development of tribal, village and community youth councils. UNITY has also made it possible for youth to formally voice their concerns at congressional and senate hearings. Other activities include conducting a series of trainings and think tanks to implement the goals of the National Youth Agenda, assisting in the continuing development of youth councils throughout Indian country, organizing a national network of American Indian and Alaska Native youth councils, providing a voice for participating youth through the National UNITY Council, and conducting a healthy lifestyles campaign. UNITY has administered the \"Youth Can Make a Difference\" project, funded by the Administration for Native Americans (ANA). The project focused on implementation of the American Indian/Alaska Native YOUTH 2000 campaign, of which the major outcome was the development of the National Agenda for American Indian/Alaska Native Youth. During the current year, UNITY is coordinating the \"Mobilizing the Healing Generation\" project, also funded by ANA. Training is offered to UNITY sponsors to help develop skills needed to establish and nurture tribal youth councils at the localleyel. Sponsors experience an ----------------------------------------------------------~------~---------------- Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities action planning and strategy development process. Evaluation of UNITY's progress is based upon the number of youth councils that are formed and continue operating from year to year. Additionally, each tribal youth council is monitored for its effort and effectiveness in managing events and activities in the areas of environmental awareness, heritage and culture, and community service projects. The key to any success experienced thus far by ~JNITY is directly attributed to the youth. 'f!~eir energy, enthusiasm, ideas, talents and involvement is what makes UNITY a program of success. The biggest obstacle is geographical distance between the youth councils and UNITY headquarters, wherein conducting business over the phone or through the mail creates some communication problems. A lack of personal contact is a drawback of any nationally-based organization, but the annual UNITY conference and regional events help overcome the distance obstacle. 69 Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Monument Valley, Utah Navajo Indian Nation Monument Valley High School PEGASUS Club Contact: Pat Seltzer, Principal Monument Valley High School Box 360008 Monument Valley, Utah 84536 (801) 727-3204 Focus Group: High school students, grades nine through 12. Feature: Providing activities, events, and social programs for high school students residing in a very remote and isolated community. Program Description: A 1990 community-wide survey administered to students and parents revealed a high level of concern over young people not having anything constructive and/or creative to do during their spare time. In addition, there were no incentives for the youth to remain drug free and very few positive adult role models in the community. The Monument Valley area is a geographically isolated, rural community with \"just a school located in the middle of a large empty area.\" The nearest town with services like a theater or mall is anywhere between 80 and 175 miles away. Isolation amI boredom continue to be the major theme behind problem issues for.youth. 70 A planning team led by then school counselor, now principal, Pat Seltzer, included teachers, students, and parents. The planning team assessed local resources for facilities, services, personnel, and programs for the purpose of developing a resource list for future activities and events. Realizing that certain limitations were invincible, the planning team focused upon the immediate need of providing a minimum of one activity per month, achievable through a collaborative partnership among the agencies and programs in the community. Serving as a supplement to the other programs in the community alliance, PEGASUS Club coordinates its efforts .with the alcohol and other drug treatment program, health services, tribal programs, law enforcement, Title V Indian Education and Johnson O'Malley Programs, and other social service organizations. The result of the efforts to develop a collaborative community alliance in providing activities and events to the youth and their families is that one major event per month is scheduled. Activities include roller skating, skiing, Grand Canyon exploration and hiking, video parties, rafting, ice skating, shopping, and coordination of personal contacts by Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities various programs to provide community support to the youth. The staffhas had no formal training, but is quick to point out a dedicated core group of individuals whose genuine commitment to and caring for the youth and community goes beyond any possible trainings offered at this time. Currently there is no formal evaluation component in place for the program, but the planning team utilizes informal letters from staff, parents, and students as a means of assessing activities and their impact. Additional sources of informal evaluation include student essays, parent petitions, and community commentaries. Thus far, the indications of the programs progress have shown satisfaction in the efforts to provide services and a high level of satisfaction with the activities being offered. The key to any success experienced thus far is directly related to the fact that if students are involved, provided with opportunities to be active and goal directed, they will respond very positively. Agreements are signed by adults and youth regarding specific responsibilities to provide clarity to the message of talking and \"walking\" a drug-free, healthy life. 71 Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Flagstaff, Arizona Navajo, Hopi and Puyallup Indian Nations Native American Prevention Project Against AIDS and Substance Abuse Contact: Julie Baldwin, Ph.D. or Jon E. Rolf, Ph.D. Northern Arizona University, mu Prevention Project NAPPASA, NAUP.O. Box 5616 Flagstaff, Arizona 86011 (602) 523-9340 and. high school students. Feature: A multi-component, in-school, and community outreach mY/AIDS, alcohol and other drug abuse prevention program for youth. Program Description: In its third year of operation, the Native American Prevention Project Against AIDS and Substance Abuse (NAPP ASA) has successfully collaborated with twenty-five schools throughout northern Arizona and western Washington to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate culturally sensitive mY/AIDS preventive interventions that are linked with alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse prevention programs. To ensure cultural sensitivity, all NAPP ASA's programs are developed through collaborative planning partnerships with local educational, health and other community-based organizations. The Project seeks to test the efficacy of 72 interventions: 1) to change risky behaviors into health-promoting ones at the individual level, and 2) to change community residents' awareness oflocal health problems and risks into participation in local mv / AOD prevention programs. During the first year research, piloting activities utilized focus group interviews to elicit information on a particular topic or cultural domain. A total of 14 focus groups were interviewed onfour main topical areas: alcohol and other drug abuse, HIVIAIDS, sexual issues, and prevention messages. Interviews were designed to elicit information particular to participant knowledge levels about the four main topic areas. Also obtained was information about participant beliefs and theories relative to peer pressure, communication barriers, AOD and other my risk factors, role models and normative beliefs. The data gathered from the interviews provided the basis for developing prevention curricula. The NAPP ASA intervention package consists of: 1) a Core curriculum, including an instructor's manual, student manual, and session specific videos, 2) follow-up booster products, and 3) a supporting program of parent and community outreach activities and media. The prevention package contains _________ ~ __ ~_~ ___ ~L_ Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities material designed to: 1) build knowledge, 2) acquire and practice prevention skills with peers, and 3) foster new peer group norms for preventive communications and behaviors in the context of Native American values. The prevention curriculum is designed to cover 20 class sessions, 50 minutes each, on topics and activities regarding alcohol and other drug abuse, human sexuality, mv / AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, life skills training, assertive communication, and self-image. Training is delivered to selected instructor/teacher teams hired to implement the curriculum. The training occurs in a two-day workshop format facilitated by JHU staff and consultants, wherein the entire curriculum is reviewed thoroughly, including the history of the project and its rationale. Participants are shown videos demonstrating \"veteran instructors\" from local schools and communities in action with the curriculum. Evaluation involves a yearly series of assessments conducted to determine the intervention effects. Students complete a questionnaire and a series of program appraisals during and at completion of the curriculum. Outcome goals for the project have been defined as: a) impact variables targeting short-term effects, and b) behavioral outcomes targeting long..:term effects. Process evaluations are utilized to determine barriers to program implementation and to document the extent of satisfaction with and cultural relevance of the preventive programs. 73 Results indicate that participants receiving NAPP ASA's school-based interventions experienced positive changes in targeted areaS of AIDS and alcohol and other drug abuse prevention. Reported availability of alcohol and other drugs significantly decreased for eighth and ninth grade participants. Keys to success are highlighted by the need to establish community partnerships through the development of local advisory groups to ensure local level involvement and ownership. Other keys include training of local schools' regular teachers and co-instructors recruited from the community and making a commitment to help community groups write new grants to continue prevention programs that are effective. Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Alhuq.uerque, New Mexico Laguna, Acoma Pueblo, Canoncito Band Navajo and Multicultural Population Center For Indian Youth Development Contact: Sally M. Davis, Ph.D., Director University of New Mexico School of Medicine Department of Pediatrics Albuquerque, New Mexico 87131-5311 (505) 277-4462 Focus Group: Children, youth and families living in rural New Mexican communities. Feature: Comprehensive substance abuse prevention program providing services to a multiculturally diverse population, primarily American Indian, in partnership with American Indian communities. Program Description: In 1983 the University of New Mexico administered a comprehensive survey to service providers, agencies, students and parents in rural communities throughout New Mexico. Data collected from the survey revealed three issues needing to be addressed: 1) alcohol abuse was viewed as the number one problem by all age groups, 2) there was a willingness among community agencies and groups to work together to address the issue, and 3) there was a consensus that efforts in prevention should occur in school\u00ad based settings. A planning team consisting of grandparents, students, 74 Indian Health Service providers, community health representatives, and university faculty began the process of planning strategies to meet the needs indicated by the survey. As each community developed its own planning team, Dr. Shirley Hunt, Center for Indian Youth director, and Ken Hunt, associate director, remained the constant component in the overall planning of the project. Such planning at the local level allowed the unique strengths of each community to be more fully developed, while maintaining the necessary scope of collaboration in developing inter-agency and inter\u00ad community alliances in order to provide more effective prevention services. The result of the efforts to develop collaborative alliances between and among communities has produced a working committee of twenty programs and organizations responsible for the support ofthe design, and developing and implementing strategies and programs. This committee meets bi\u00ad monthly to share information, coordinate activities, and plan future events. Program activities for the Center for Indian Youth Development include, classroom curricula for pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade, designed with and for local schools and communities, and inservice training for teachers and other Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities professionals on topics related to the curriculum and issues of substance abuse. Training activities for families include parenting skills, coping with alcohol and other drug abuse in the family, communication skills, understanding child development, and social influences. The scope of the program goes well beyond the typical school day to encompass the total ecology of the child. Activities occur during school, after school, on weekends, and throughout the summer months, providing youth with alternatives to substance abuse designed to enrich and strengthen their lives. Other activities include camp outs and outdoor recreation, various social events, and counseling, which is offered through formal educational sessions and informal rap sessions during and after school. The activities developed are carried out by American Indian prevention coordinators under the direct supervision of the program's associate director. All training activities are coordinated intergenerationally and include tribal government leaders and ministers, as well as members of the planning committee. Topics presented are related to issues of adolescent health and development relative to substance abuse. Monitoring progress includes data collection from a variety of sources to provide formative measures. These sources include logs, journals, curriculum pre-and posttests, student evaluations, surveys of parents, school staff and students regarding services and activities, trip evaluations, videotape evaluations, focus groups, and Teen Center client files. Aside from the longevity of the Center for Indian Youth Development 75 Program there are a number of indicators of success including youth, parent and school staff evaluations which clearly state a high level of satisfaction experienced from the program. The indicators also include continued demand from commumti~s for training offered through the program and, possibly the best indicator of success, the program was selected by the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) and the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors as one of eight nationally recognized exemplary programs working to prevent substance abuse. This is a very prestigious award and speaks volumes as to the impact and success of the Center for Indian Youth Program. Keys to success include endurance and persistence in working with changing administration and resistant youth and community members. Establishing trust and communication with school administration assists in maintaining the program's credibility and the capability of deiivering consistently high quality activities. Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Wagoner, Oklahoma Cherokee Indian Nation Area Prevention Resource Center Contact: John Eckenberger, Director Area Prevention Resource Center 1202 West Cherokee, Suite G Wagoner, Oklahoma 74467 (918) 485-4221 Focus Group: All age groups within the servIce area. Feature: One of 18 Prevention Resource Centers in Oklahoma, serving tour counties with substance abuse related materials, resources and support. Program Description: As a member of the Oklahoma statewide prevention resource network, the Prevention Resource Center in Wagoner is involved with a statewide planning team. With representatives from 18 different areas actively participating in the planning process for statewide and local substance abuse-related initiatives and activities, local areas are assured of effective representation and service. Members of the planning team include prevention specialists, education personnel, alcohol and other drug treatment staff, researchers, and various agency representatives. Jan Hardwick, director of prevention services with the Department of Mental Health in Oklahoma City, was primarily responsible for developing the program and establishing the planning team. 76 Meeting on a monthly basis, the Prevention Resource Center planning team establishes statewide goals and objectives. They also report on area progress relative to the statewide agenda, collaborate on statewide program activities such as the Oklahoma State Prevention Convention, prevention efforts in the penal system, and conduct Red Ribbon Week activities. Other activities include the development of a radio program and newsletter to reach dropouts and others not attending meetings or activities. The Prevention Resource Center network has developed an outline of required training, classes, and workshops to attend in order to gain certification as a Prevention Specialist Topics included in the outline are AIDS training, the Lofquist model of prevention philosophy, student assistance programs, Growing Up Strong (GUS), and school team development. Building community and local school components into the training is crucial in helping communities develop their unique strengths. Methods used to monitor progress include student and community-wide attitudinal surveys repeated yearly for comparison to baseline data. The main illdicator of success is the increased demand for services provided through Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities the Prevention Resource Center Network. Communities are rapidly gaining awareness of the availability and quality of the services, leading to full training schedules. Recommendations for other programs include the need for more training being offered to staff in order to more fully develop an effective program from the beginning, rather than feeling one step behind. Training is particularly important when working in rural settings as there are distinct differences needing to be recognized and understood before involvement takes place. Maintaining an effective communication network is crucial to sustaining community support for a statewide program. 77 ..sootnweStRegional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Tucson, Arizona Various Tribes Old Pascua Youth Artists (OPYA) Contact: Carol S. Kestler, Executive Director ARTS GENESIS, INC. 1311 East Duke Drive Tucson,Puizona 85719 (602) 323-0185 Focus Group: Ages eight to seventeen. Feature: Old Pascua Youth Artists (OPYA) provides a creative, fun and educational alternative for children in a safe, drug-and violence-free community setting staffed by community artists. Program Description: Old Pascua Youth Artists (OPY A) grew out of a parent/community meeting in 1988 wherein the assessment of an informal survey of parents and students indicated sufficient interest for an after\u00ad school pilot program to teach art and business skills, along with coping, social, academic, and behavioral skills to strengthen protective factors in youth and the community. OPY A represents a true collaborative partnership as it exists because of the relationship between the San Ignacio Yaqui Council and Arts Genesis, Inc. The two organizations form the core of a community alliance which has spread rapidly and encompasses a rich blend of business and service agencies within the community of Tucson. Once the alliance between the San Ignacio Yaqui Council and Arts Genesis, Inc. was established, a 78 planning team was formed consisting of parents, artists, Yaqui educators, center services director and assistant director, school administration, and the TEEM Follow Through Coordinator. The planning team recognized the need to broaden representation and actively sought out the involvement of alcohol and other drug treatment programs, business and industry, tribal government, civic groups, family and social services, religious organizations, and the school system. This rich community alliance, known as the San Ignacio Yaqui Council, forms the backbone ofthe OPYA Governing Board which works to plan, approve, oversee and evaluate the program. The program activities are directly reflective of the community alliance. The Pascua Neighborhood Center, part of the Tucson Parks and Recreation system, provides meeting space, coordination with other programs, janitorial services and clerical assistance. La Frontera Behavioral Health Center provides a Yaqui prevention counselor 16 hours per month to work individually with OPY A members) participate in workshops, and plan, implement, and evaluate field trips and community events with OPYA staff. Local businesses assist with tools and supplies, inventory storage, publications assistance, funding and showcasing OPY A. artwork. Arizona State Museum, affiliated with the University of Southwest Regional Center for Drug-Free Schools and Communities Arizona, hosted a 19-month show of work titled IIYaqui Visions: Old Pascua Youth Artists. It The museum purchased the entire show. OPYA programming is closely associated with PROJECT CHOKI, an in-house elementary school arts program. The Pima County Anti\u00ad Racketeering Fund Grant Program has been a major OPYAfunding source. The Social Services Department of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe co-funded the 1993 summer training series. An annual average of 3 8 volunteers, donating more than 800 hours as guest teaching artists and photographers, trip and event staff and business representatives, provide . crucial support to the program's depth and success. Many of the volunteers are from local churches and religious organizations. Training for OPY A staff, volunteers, and parents has been provided by Phyllis Kietha Gagnier, AlgonquinIMohawk, a consultant out of Apache Junction, Arizona. Training topics have included principle-focused leadership and bias perception, group process skill development, and co-facilitation. OPY A members and staff also receive ongoing fine arts training and support from professional visual artists, photographers and writers, most of whom are American Indian. Monitoring progress includes a variety of methods. Members sign a contract with OPY A (co-signed with parents or guardian), sign in and out of class and workshops, and keep portfolios of their work. As the participants are paid for their work, payroll is based upon fulfillment of their contract responsibilities, plus cooperation, commitment, participation and individual 79 sales of artwork. Consequently and with purpose, the youth are exposed to and involved in free enterprise while honoring community principles and values. A portion of the sales money is deposited in the OPYA Scholarship endowment fund available to middle and high school student members. Individual success stories, consistent participation, and a growing community alliance are the markers indicating success for the Old Pascua Youth Artists program. Several items are included as indicators of program progress, including the majority of OPYA members who have continued the program more than two years, with some five-year members. Ninety percent of those OPY A members who have remained in the neighborhood are in school, none are pregnant, and none have been arrested. In addition all Native staff who have left OPY A have gone on to full-time college enrollment, and public interest in and financial support for the program grows steadily. Building upon protective factors and strengthening resiliency are keys to the success of the program.
