While Tylenol is a safe drug when used correctly, incorrect dosages can make an infant or child sick. How do Tylenol dosages differ for infants and children? Old formulations In the old formulations, infants' Tylenol and children's Tylenol had different concentrations: - Infants' formulation was more concentrated, containing 80 milligrams of acetaminophen in 0.8 milliliters of the liquid. It had to be administered with a dropper. - Children's Tylenol was less concentrated with 160 milligrams of acetaminophen in 5 milliliters of the liquid. Because of these different concentrations, there used to be a risk of incorrect dosing. Since June 2011, however, both infants' and children's versions of the drug have been standardized to contain 160 milligrams of acetaminophen in 5 milliliters of the liquid.
