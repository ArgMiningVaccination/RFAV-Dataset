Symptoms are typically temporary, mild to moderate, and can be managed at home with over-the-counter remedies. - In some cases, children and teenagers may experience more side effects than adults.

If you need help managing your side effects, or in the unlikely event they appear to be worsening, please call your doctor. You can also call our nurses 24/7 at [800-551-0859](tel:800-551-0859) [952-993-4665](tel:952-993-4665) VAERS The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national program managed by the CDC and FDA to monitor the safety of all vaccines licensed in the United States. [VAERS (PDF) ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/vaers_factsheet1.pdf) An \"adverse event\" is any health problem or \"side effect\" that happens after a vaccination. VAERS cannot determine if a vaccine caused an adverse event but can determine if further investigation is needed. VAERS is a service of the CDC and FDA - VAERS is not affiliated with HealthPartners.

Parental consent is required for anyone under 18 years old to be vaccinated. The CDC recommends all people who are pregnant or breastfeeding get vaccinated against COVID-19. This recommendation is based on an analysis of nearly 2,500 pregnant people who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine series before 20 weeks of pregnancy. In particular, the rate of miscarriages among pregnant women who received a COVID-19 vaccine was similar to the expected rate of miscarriage among all women. This suggests there isn't any evidence for an increased risk of miscarriage due to vaccination. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, also recommend pregnant or nursing mothers get vaccinated against COVID-19. To help you make an informed decision, discuss COVID-19 vaccination with your doctor or midwife. Yes. Natural immunity following a COVID-19 infection can vary by individual; it may be weaker if you had a mild or asymptomatic infection. Vaccination is recommended as soon as your COVID-19 symptoms resolve and your isolation period has passed. No, you can't get the COVID-19 vaccine if you currently have COVID-19. Follow the CDC's [isolation and precautions for people with COVID-19 ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html) Yes. There's no waiting period between receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and receiving other vaccines - you can receive your vaccines on any schedule, or at the same time. It's especially important for kids and teens to keep up with their [doctor-recommended vaccination schedule](/blog/childhood-immunization-schedule-by-age/) If you were vaccinated outside the U.S., we recommend talking with your doctor or clinician for the most personalized advice.

Please check with your insurance company by calling the Member Services number located on your ID card. FAQs on effectiveness and safety We're here to help you get trusted answers about the vaccines so you can feel confident in your choice to get vaccinated. Yes. The data suggest all currently approved or authorized vaccines are effective in preventing illness from COVID-19, with the greatest protection coming against severe illness, hospitalization and death. You must complete your vaccination for maximum protection. Efficacy of incomplete vaccination has not been systematically evaluated. If you're not sure whether you've completed your vaccination, please contact your care team. All vaccines are effective, and all vaccines are considered clinically equivalent in preventing hospitalization and death due to severe COVID-19. Given the excellent performance and effectiveness of all vaccines in this important measurement, we strongly encourage you to receive any approved or authorized vaccine that's offered. Very few vaccines are 100% effective, and the COVID-19 vaccines are no exception. Therefore it's still possible for a person to get COVID-19 even after being vaccinated. The vaccines themselves do not cause COVID-19. If you do get COVID-19 after you're vaccinated, your illness will very likely be less severe than if you hadn't been vaccinated. All vaccine manufacturers must meet strict safety standards. These standards were established before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the COVID-19 vaccines went through the same rigorous clinical trials that other vaccines go through. While the COVID-19 vaccines do seem to cause more [side effects ](/content/dam/brand-identity/pdfs/care/after-your-covid-19-vaccination-what-to-know-and-what-to-do.pdf) Based on the latest evidence and analysis, the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine may be associated with an increased risk of blood clots and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Please note: Serious side effects after the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine are extremely rare. Getting the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine remains a better choice than not getting any vaccine at all. If you previously received the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine, serious side effects are extremely unlikely. However, seek immediate medical attention if you develop any of these symptoms: - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Leg swelling - Persistent abdominal pain - Severe or persistent headaches - Blurred vision, double vision or inability to move your eyes - Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection - Weakness or tingling sensations (especially in the legs or arms) - Difficulty walking - Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing - Difficulty with bladder control or bowel function No, there's no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines affect development or fertility. The vaccines don't change the body's DNA or functioning in any way. Instead, they teach the body's immune system to recognize and fight the coronavirus in case it's ever encountered. The immune system is separate from the reproductive system, so there's no reason to believe a vaccine would affect fertility, future offspring, or growth and development. If you still have questions, we recommend you [talk with a doctor](https://www.healthpartners.com/care/appointments/start?main=primary-care&primary-care=office-visit&try-video=yes) For the first 72 hours after vaccination, you may experience side effects. Symptoms are typically temporary, mild to moderate and can be managed at home with over-the-counter remedies. - In some cases, children and teenagers may experience more side effects than adults. This is not unusual - because younger people tend to have stronger immune systems, the vaccine creates a more robust response as it trains the body. If you need help managing your side effects, or in the unlikely event they appear to be worsening, please talk to your doctor.

To be protected from both, you need two different vaccinations. You can get both vaccinations at the same time. We recommend everyone who's able to get the COVID-19 vaccine does so. We don't yet know enough about COVID-19 to know if population (herd) immunity is possible through vaccination. That's what happens when a majority of the population is immune to a disease and protects those who aren't by stopping the spread of it. We also don't yet know how long population immunity could take to reach, even if it is possible. Vaccination is the best and clearest way to stop the spread of COVID-19 without many more people getting sick. "}
