It is a multisystemic disease affecting mostly the nervous system (intellectual de cits, delayed psychomotor devel- opment, ataxia, epilepsy, behavioral problems, etc.), by congenital heart defects and various dysmorphisms. This microdeletion was found in 0.57- 1.27% of pediatric patients targeted for microarray analysis,mainly with developmental delay and intellectual de cits. However, not all of the deletion carriers have a clinical manifestation - it is found in 0.25% of the population ofhealthy controls. The penetrance of 15q11.2 microdelection syndrome is estimated at 10.4%, which is signi cantly higher in de novo occurrence. We report 4 cases of pre-natally established 15q11.2 microdeletion, in 3 of the cases the microdeletion was inherited from clinically healthy mothers. The indications for aCGH prenatal diagnosis were:1) ultrasound data for unilateral cleft lip and palate in combination with an increased nuchal translucency of 3.3 mm- mother was the carrier; 2) second pregnancy after therst case; 3) increased risk from the biochemical screening (1:6) and tricuspid regurgitation, brother with neu- ropsychiatric disability - mother was a carrier; 4) IncreasedNT of 7.3 mm. Our results highlight the importance of microarray analysis in the diagnostic re nement of1234567890();,: 1234567890();,:pregnancies which are abnormal in early fetal screening. We emphasize the dif culties of genetic counseling in the inheritance and the incomplete penetrance of the aberrations. K. Belemezova: None. P. Chaveeva: None. V. Stra- tieva: None. M. Yankova: None.

P01.002.B Improvement of prenatal care in case of fetal anomaly of the corpus callosum using exome sequencing during the CHU of the corpus callosum (ACC) are usually diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. This malforma-tion is characterized by its uncertain prognosis especially when isolated which makes the prenatal counselingdifcult. Among genetic etiologies, only chromosomal anomalies are investigated during the prenatal period while ACC is due to single gene mutation in most cases and neurodevelopmental prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Methods: In order to evaluate the feasibility and contribution of prenatal exome sequencing (pES) during the pregnancy, we included 66 fetuses with ACC for trio analysis. Only pathogenic variants in known ACC and/orID genes were considered. Results: pES results were available within a median delay of 22 days. A pathogenic SNV was identi ed in 12 cases (18%). Moreover, a pathogenic CNV was identi ed in 4 cases. Thus, the genetic cause was determined in 22% of cases. In all cases with diagnoses, pES results enlightenedthe neurodevelopmental prognosis of the fetus and enabled the parents to choose to continue with or terminate the pregnancy knowingly. Conclusions: This is the rst study of pES focusing on a single malformation characterized by an uncertain prog- nosis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of pES infetuses with prenatal diagnosis of ACC. pES has an evident clinical impact. The impact of pES when negative remains to be evaluated S. Heide: None. M.

P01.003.C Genetic management of a small deletion in the PWS/AS imprinting center in a prenatal case C. P\u00e9rez1, E. Pesta\u00f1a2, C. Rivera2, M. Aug\u00e91, L. Barranco1, Spain Introduction: Imprinted genes involved in PWS and AS are under control of an imprinting center comprising two regulatory regions, PWS-SRO (around the SNRPN pro-moter) and the AS-SRO (35 kb upstream). A very few AS patients have small and/or atypical deletions in AS-SRO.142 J. del PicchiaPatient and Results: Pregnant patient (13 weeks) was referred because a daughter of 4 years old with development delay and peculiar phenotype and a 62Kb copy number loss at 15q11.2, arr[GRCh37] 15q11.2(25119854_25177138)x1. In extended familial studies, mother (pregnant) and grand- father have both the same deletion. MS-MLPA wasperformed in the daughter and the pregnant. The 15q11.2 deletion was con rmed in both and an altered methylation pattern in the daughter was detected correlating with an ASdiagnosis. ArrayCGH analysis (CytoSure UK) was performed in chorionic villus sample same deletion of 62Kb involving exon ofAS-SRO (exon 4 detected. MS-MLPA (PW/AS MS-MLPA Kit, MRC Holland) was performed in amniotic fluid with alteration of the methylation pattern, compatible with hypomethylation of the probes located in the CpG islands region of SNRPN gene was detected. Considering all the results, a prenataldiagnosis of AS was performed. Comments: IC deletion have been described in a small fraction of AS patients with ID, with no disease-causingvariants detected to date.Deletions involving AS-SRO are a molecular defect that must be determined as the recurrence risk in case of a familial IC deletion. Caution should bemade in prenatal diagnosis and is appropriate recommend- ing MS-MLPA analysis. C. P\u00e9rez: None. E. Pesta\u00f1a: None. C. Rivera: None. M. Aug\u00e9: None. L. Barranco: None. A.

P01.005.B START: Thestudy of assistedreproductive technologies R. Lyle 1, C. e e2, K. L. Haftorn2, A. H\u00e5berg2 1Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway,2Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway In the last few decades there have been marked changes in patterns of fertility and family structure in rich countries. These include increasing age at childbirth, a lower number of children born to each woman or man, greater use ofassisted reproductive technology (ART), higher frequency of family disruptions and increasingly complex family structures. The Centre for Fertility and Health (CeFH;www.cefh.no ) consists of a multidisciplinary research team of epidemiologists, geneticists, demographers, sociologistsand economists with research themes including fertility problems andintergenerational transmission of health . The START project aims to understand the causes and health consequences of subfertility and how genetic in flu- ences and epigenetic differences are associated with sub- fertility and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART).ART may introduce epigenetic changes in the embryo since the procedures are during a period of extensive epigenetic repatterning. It is unknown which genes may be affectedand the potential health consequences for the children. START uses data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa; https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/ moba/ ), which follows more than 110 000 children and their parents. We have collected genetic and epigenetic data from 1000 trios with children born after ART, and 1000 triosfrom naturally conceived children analyzed with the Illu- mina EPIC array and the Illumina HumanCoreExome chip. Investigations are focussed on the effect of ART treatmenton imprinted genes and fertility genes, and how epigenetic age acceleration interacts with fertility and ART treatment. Our results show DNA methylation changes due to bothparental subfertility and ART procedures. R. Lyle: None. C. Page: None. Y. Lee: None. K.L. A. J. None. P. Magnus: None. S. H\u00e5berg: None. P01.006.C Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome: a prenatal case report with a novel CDKN1C mutation P. Maia Almeida 1,2, Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal,5Clinical Academic Center of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal Introduction: Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) is a genomic imprinting disorder typically diagnosed after birth. Some ultrasound features that include polyhydramnios, omphalocele, and visceromegaly may raise the clinicalsuspicion in prenatal. Most reported BWS cases are sporadic, but around 15% may be familial. Delineation of the molecular defects can predict familial recurrence risksand make invasive prenatal diagnosis possible.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 143Case Report: We report a case of a 41-year-old pregnant woman in whom ultrasound revealed at 24-weeks corpus callosum hypoplasia, macroglossia, omphalocele, short long bones and enlarged kidneys. The pregnancy was terminated and autopsy con rmed the ultrasound ndings and also enlarged ovaries and pancreas, cytomegaly of the adrenalcortex and a placental mesenchymal dysplasia. Family history was irrelevant. Materials and Methods: Clinical and molecular char- acterization of a prenatal case with diagnosis of BWS. We performed array-CGH, methylation analysis at 11p15.5 BWS locus and Sanger sequencing of CDKN1C gene. The presence of the variant identi ed in the foetus was tested in the parents. Results: Array-CGH and 11p15.5 methylation analysis NM_000076.2:c.479del p.(Pro160Argfs*112) ofmaternal origin. Conclusions: This case demonstrates that search for a clear speci c molecular diagnosis is key not only to con rm the diagnosis but also to provide proper genetic counselling. Although present in only 5% of the patients with no family history the identi cation of a CDKN1C pathogenic variant of maternal origin increases the recurrence risk to 50%. P. Maia Almeida: None. S.

Pieretto, G. B. Ferrero , A. Mussa Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy Introduction: the prenatal phenotype of Beckwith- Wiedemann spectrum (BWSp) is not well characterized. Here we investigate the prenatal features of large series of BWSp patients. Methods: postnatal phenotype, genotype, prenatal ultra- sound (US) features, pregnancy course and biochemical screening tests of 88 patients with BWSp (51 females) werereviewed. Results: molecular tests had been performed in 86 patients, 80 resulted positives for BWSp-related anomalies,6 negative with a clinical diagnosis. Seventeen (19.3%) were conceived through arti cial reproductive techniques. Twin- ning occurred in 9 pregnancies and resulted in 13 BWSpnewborns. Pregnancy biochemical screening tests showed increased Morphology US scan (available in 64) revealed abdominal and head circumferences higher than normal (1.41 \u00b1 1.10 SD,p< 0.001 and \u00b1 normal femur lengths. Fifty-eight patients (66%) had a various combination of pathologic US ndings, including enlarged abdominal circumference at 20 weeks 'scan (n=17), macrosomia at a subsequent scan ( n=35, of normal at 20 weeks no detected anomaly at any US. Conclusions: on the basis of these ndings, we propose a new embryo-fetal BWSp scoring system, mirroring the post-natal one, that will implement the prenatal clinical approach of this developmental syndrome.

P01.008.B Prenatal diagnosis of a severe form of BICD2-opathy : further evidence of an extreme phenotypic spectrum E. Marchionni 1, E. Agolini2, G. Sapienza Pediatrico Bambino Ges\u00f9, Rome, Italy,3Depart- ment of Maternal and Child Health and Urologic Science, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy,4Pediatrics and Child Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is characterized by the development of multiple joint con- tractures. Neurogenic and myogenic-types have been described, resulting in complete or partial movementrestriction. In prenatal diagnosis decreased fetal movement is observed, the most severe forms being lethal in utero or after birth. We report a case of a male fetus at 22 gestationalweeks with evidence of AMC on ultrasound, presenting xed extended legs and flexed arms, bilateral clubfoot and absent fetal movements. Frontal oedema was also observed.After amniocentesis, karyotype Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on fetus genomic DNA and his unaffected parents. Results: WES analysis disclosed a de novo heterozygous pathogenic deletion (NM_015250.3: c.1636_1638delAAT; p. Asn546del) in BICD2 gene, associated with autosomal dominant spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity- predominant 2 (SMALED2). The couple decided to terminate the pregnancy. Babygram showed bilateral genurecurvatum, bilateral clubfoot and clubhand and multiple joints contractures. Conclusions: BICD2 mutations are associated with severe prenatal-onset forms spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity-predominant milder forms with childhood-onset (SMALED2A). In literaturefew prenatal cases are reported, mostly with early lethal outcome. The same variant was previously described in two children with a severe postnatal phenotype but belated ormilder prenatal signs. This observation expands BICD2 phenotypic spectrum, with further evidence of early-onset extreme prenatal forms. To date, the localization of thedisease-causing mutations does not seem to correlate with disease severity, other molecular mechanisms should be investigated to elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations.

Achilleos, Patsalis NIPD Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus Introduction: Carrier screening increasingly becomes more prevalent as prospective parents become more aware that the cumulative risk of having an affected child with an autosomal or X-linked condition can be higher than that forcommon aneuploidies. The changing admixture of popula- tions, and the increase in gamete donation in assisted reproductive technologies have led professional organiza-tions and professional bodies to recommend expanded carrier screening to the general population. Materials and Methods: The test was developed using targeted in-solution hybridization enrichment followed by next generation sequencing covering all gene exons, andintron-exon boundaries, associated with 229 autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions. The sensitivity and specicity for nucleotide variant (SNV), indel and copy number variant (CNV) a blind validation study. Results: SNVs and indels were detected at (>99.0%) and speci city (>99.9%). The algo- rithm was also designed to detect CNVs to a single or a few exons with high sensitivity and speci city. Each positive call was con rmed with an orthogonal method. Conclusions: We have developed and validated an expanded pan-ethnic carrier screening test which includes229 autosomal recessive and X-linked conditions. The test provides individuals and prospective parents with clinical information, helping them understand and evaluate theirreproductive options. S. Kyriakou: A.

M. A. Mori1, J. Nevado1, E. Mansilla1, Spain Introduction: In the last years microarrays (CMA) has demonstrated to be a signi cant tool useful in the prenatal area, mainly in fetuses with sonography anomalies. How-ever, using array-CGH in an invasive prenatal context is still under a signi cant and controversial debate especiallyAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 145regarding the use of CMA in advance maternal age or maternal anxiety samples. Previous studies supported the evidence on the feasibility of introducing a-CGH as a rst- line diagnostic testing routine prenatal diagnosis practice (1). Indeed, others and our laboratory have reported sig- nicant diagnostic yields also in low-risk pregnancies, between 1.6-4% (2,3). Methods : We used customized Karyoarray \u00aev3.0 platform (4) to study consecutive invasive prenatal samples alongtwo-year period. QF-PCR positive cases were excluded. Results : We analyzed 800 samples and we found globally 6% of pathogenic CNVs and 2% of VUS. We segregatedlow-risk pregnancy samples (positive biochemical screen- ing, soft markers, maternal anxiety, and antenatal death without sonographic anomalies). Diagnostic yield in thisgroup was 4.5% (17/379). Discussion : In conclusion, the use of the array-CGH in the prenatal context demonstrated a greater diagnosticcapacity not only in fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities but also in low-risk pregnancies. Therefore, we de nitively recommend the possibility of using the array-CGH in allthose gestations that undergo invasive prenatal diagnosis, after excluding by QF-PCR the most common aneuploidies.

P01.016.A seyedhassani, f. yazdgenetic, yazd, Iran, Islamic Republic ofIntroduction: A 39- year- old mother was referred with GA=16 w+5 d and high risk pregnancy screening test for T 21. The rst child of this patient was a 14- years old suffering from developmental delay and mental retardation. On the other hand, this family had two spontaneous abor-tion. These evidences revealed enough reasons for prob- ability of chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, monosomy X, and other chromosomal disorderin fetus. Amniocentesis was suggested for complementary investigation. Methods and materials: Twenty metaphases cells were studied on the basis of G-Banding technique from culture ofamniocytes in two flasks. Then, karyotypig was done on the basis of G-Banding for the parents. Result: In this study, we described a paternal chromo- somal aberration of twins. Through a combination of cytogenetic assessment of fetus and parents 46, XY, der (9) t(2;9) (p23;p22)pat was shown. Mother 's karyotype was 46XX but father 's karyotype revealed an abnormal chromosome complement in all cells with balanced 46, XY,t(2;9)(p23;p22). Conclusions: Paternal chromosomal balanced transloca- tion can explain repeated abortions in this family. On the other hand, unbalanced chromosomal translocation result-ing from paternal inheritance lead to developmental delay in his son. This study was highly emphasized the priority of genetic counseling and attention to the family history andgenetic basis of parents in evolution of repeated sponta- neous abortion. Legal abortion was recommended to unbalance chromosomal abnormalities. M.

Uslu1,G Buyukkurt2 Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Medical Biology, Adana, Turkey,2\u00c7ukurova University, Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Adana, Turkey Amniocentesis is a very crucial diagnostic procedure for preventing the birth of genetically defective fetuses in order to decrease the prevalence of genetic diseases in popula-tions. A retrospective review of our amniocentesis database for the period from January 2000 to February 2020 was carried out. The karyotyping of 8531 fetuses was carried outin Department of Medical Biology from the samples of amniotic fluids which were sent from Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Balcali Hospital. A standartnomenclature has been developed to describe each of types of abnormality found in human chromosomes. A total of 8531 amniocentesis specimens were processed during thestudy period. 620 fetuses (7.26%) had various chromosomal abnormalities. 54.51% of abnormal karyotypes (338 cases) were numerical and 43.38% (269 cases) were structural.Both numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations were observed in 13 cases (2.09%). The ratios were as:146 J. del Syndrome (0.88%), and the others in all numerical abnormalities. The frequent structural abnormalities were as: 46,XX/XY, unbalanced translocations, deletionsand duplications were also found in less ratio. According to the literature and our results, advanced maternal age is the main cause of fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Fetalchromosomal abnormality ratio that we found was 7.26%. This ratio emphasize the importance of prenatal diagnosis. A. Pazarbasi: None. D. Alptekin: None. N.S. Ilgaz: None. I.N. G. S. None. O. Demirhan: None. U. Luleyap: None. M.B. Yilmaz: None.

Maya2, Tikva, Israel,3Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel Objective: To examine the risk for chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) aberrations in fetuses with nuchal translu- cency (NT) of 3 to 3.4 mm. Methods: The results of allCMA tests performed due to an NT of 3 to 3.4 mm were retrospectively retrieved from the Ministry of Health com- puterized database. The rates of clinically signi cant (pathogenic and likely pathogenic) microarray ndings were compared to a previously published local control population, encompassing 5541 fetuses with normal ultra-sound. Results: Overall, 619 CMA analyses were performed due to a sonographic indication of NT of 3 to 3.4 mm. Of these, 29 (4.7%) clinically signi cant copy number variants were detected, a considerably increased risk compared to control pregnancies. Fetal karyotyping would have missed 31% of the abnormal cases, while non-invasive prenatalscreening (NIPS) would have overlooked 31-49% of the anomalies, depending on the method. Conclusions: The outcomes of our study, representing the largest number ofCMA results in fetuses with NT of 3 to 3.4 mm, suggest that the rate of abnormal CMA ndings in these pregnancies is signicantly higher compared to pregnancies with normal ultrasound. Our results support the consideration to perform invasive prenatal testing for CMA in pregnancies with NTabove 3 mm. In addition, as several of the CMA ndings in these pregnancies are not associated with major sonographic anomalies, it seems that NIPS with later sonographic survey cannot adequately replace NT measurement.

Grootscholten1, L. Medical Center Groningen, Department of Obstetrics, Groningen,Netherlands, 3Univeristy Medical Center Groningen, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, Groningen, Netherlands Background: Adding whole exome sequencing (WES) to the standard diagnostic procedure in fetuses with ultrasoundanomalies improves the diagnostic yield. Identifying a diagnosis is important for parental choice and informed reproductive decision making, amongst other factors. Herewe describe three fetuses in whom a diagnosis of achon- drogenesis type 2 ( COL2A1 variant) due to maternal mosaicism was made using WES. Materials & Methods: A couple expecting dichorionic diamniotic twins, both with severe limb shortening and fetal hydrops, was referred to our department. A previouspregnancy had been terminated for the same reasons. QF- PCR and SNP array were performed on DNA of chorionic villi from both fetuses of the current pregnancy. WES wasperformed on parental DNA (extracted from blood) and fetal DNA. Results: QF-PCR and SNP-array showed no abnormal- ities for both fetuses. WES revealed a pathogenic, apparently de novo, COL2A1 variant c.3062_3079del p. (Pro1021_Gly1026del) in both samples, which explainedthe ultrasound abnormalities. Retrospective analysis con- rmed the presence of the same COL2A1 variant in the previous pregnancy. Re-analysis of parental WES datarevealed the variant in less than 1% of maternal reads, implying an extremely low grade of mosaicism, which was conrmed by Sanger sequencing. Conclusions: This case study highlights the added value of WES in prenatal diagnostics, including the capacity to identify extremely low-grade parental mosaicism thatprofoundly impact the recurrence risk of a genetic disease. It also suggests that the possibility of very low-gradeAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 147parental mosaicism should be closely investigated when an apparently de novo variant is identi ed.

On the other hand, use of new molecular methods, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have shown bene ts in diagnosis of chromosomal and genetic diseases, which are not detectable with cff-DNA screening, but require invasiveprocedure. We prospectively evaluated performance of cFTS in Estonia during 2 years using national guidelines with application of CMA and NGS in high-riskpregnancies. Material and methods: We investigated 14,566 singleton pregnancies (60% of all pregnancies). We selected 334high-risk pregnancies for CMA diagnostic performance evaluation and 28 cases of highly dysmorphic fetuses for NGS analysis. CMA study group was divided into twogroups based on the indications for testing: group A patients with high-risk for trisomies after cFTS, but normal ultrasound and group B patients who met criteria forCMA as a rst-tier diagnostic test.Results: We found the rst trimester detection rate 94%, 100% and 100% for trisomies 21, 18 and 13, respectively, with false-positive rate of 3.1%. The diagnostic yield of CMA was overall 3.6% (1.7% in Group A and 6.0% in Group B). In NGS analysis group we report diagnostic yield of 17.9%. Combining these three methods, overall detectionrate of all genetic anomalies was 101 (0.7%). Conclusions: the use of CMA and NGS in high-risk pregnancies after cFTS is justi ed and increase diagnostic yield. Funding: Estonian Research Council grants PUT355, PRG471, and PUTJD827. K.

The main goal of this study was to eval-uate the incidence of congenital anomalies in ART con- ceived children. Methods: The retrospective epidemiological analysis was performed using data from the National Registry of Congenital Anomalies and National Registry of Newborns, run by the Institute of Health Information and Statistics ofthe Czech Republic. All diagnoses of congenital anomalies (Q00-Q99) were included. We compared the incidences of congenital anomalies in naturally conceived children andART conceived children born in the Czech Republic during148 J. del Picchia5 years period (2013-2017). Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher 's exact test. Results: During the selected period there were 547 675 children born in the Czech Republic (531 064 were naturally conceived children and 16 611 were ART conceived children). The incidence of congenital anomalieswas 3.90% in naturally conceived children group and 4.35% in ART conceived children. This difference is statistically signicant (p =0.003). Analyzing different subgroups of congenital anomalies we have found a signi cantly increased incidence of anomalies in two subgroups: Congenital malformations of the circulatory system (Q20-Q28) and Congenital malformations of the respiratory system (Q30-Q34). Discussion: The increased risk of congenital anomalies in ART conceived children was highlighted in many studies however the results are often diverse. In our population- based study, we con rmed a signi cantly higher general incidence of congenital anomalies in ART conceived children.

CHDs are a frequent nding during routine ultrasound prenatal screening. Once detected, it is important to determine their etiology. The22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is the most fre- quent known genetic cause of CHDs (1.9% prevalence). We present a multiplex marker PCR kit to detect 22q11.2deletions and duplications which we prospectively used in 1630 individuals and 450 fetal cases with a congenital heart defect referred by an obstetrician. Important features: 1)Low cost (there are 2 mixes of 11 pairs of primers and 2 conventional PCR reactions). 2) Fast, results can be given within hours of receiving the sample (DNA extraction ->PCR 1.5 hours -> automatic sequencer). 3) Safely rules out sample contamination by maternal DNA. 4) Uses small amounts of DNA (10 ng) and can be performed startingfrom amniotic fluid or non-cultured chorion biopsy or any other tissue. 5) In prenatal samples, it would be com- plementary to the QF-PCR (negative samples for trisomy13, 18 or 21). 6) The parental origin of the deletion/dupli- cation is determined when the fetus is analyzed with the parents. 7) Detects atypical and typical deletions, extendingthe analysis far beyond that given by the FISH probe that has been historically used (TUPLE1). 8) We have devel- oped a panel of 31 additional markers, not included in themultiplex, to be used in case of lack of informativity.

Materials and methods: We examined 93 Russian male CF patients (17-45 y.o., mean - 24.9 \u00b1 5.7 y.o.). Physical examination, scrotal ultrasonography, hormonal, biochem- ical, and semen analysis were done. Standard andbiochemical semen examination were done according to the WHO 's (2010) recommendations. The CFTR gene variants were analyzed using by AFPL, MLPA and DNAsequencing (Sanger 's method and MPS). Results: mutations were and genotypes high frequency of \"mild\"pathogenic variants (25.8%) and genotypes (50.5%), as well as a relatively high frequency of 3849 +10kb>T variant (12.4%), which was identi ed in OA ( p< 0.00001). with F508del/3849 +10kbC>T and F508del/F508del genotypes for a prevalence of p=0.03). Conclusions: CF dramatically affects reproductive organs, male fertility and semen parameters in CF patients, at that 3849 +10kb>T mutation in the CFTR genotype is major genetic factor of male fertility.

Lahad3,4 1Medical Genetics Institute, Obstetrics and Gynecol- ogy, Shaare Zedek Medcial Center, Jerusalem, Israel, 3Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel,4Clalit Health Services, Jerusalem, Israel Background: Since implementation of NIPS, rst and second trimester biochemical tests may no longer be necessary for Down Syndrome screening. However, studiessuggest their ability to predict pregnancy complications. We sought to evaluate whether screening tests have value for this purpose. Methods: Our cohort included all women who had rst and/or second trimester screening from 2015-2018 andsubsequently delivered in our center. Data was collected on demographics, medical history, biochemical screening and maternal-fetal pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression wasperformed to examine correlations between biochemical markers and pregnancy complications using SPSS version 25.0 (SPSS, Inc). Results: Over 3.5 years, 5400 women had screening tests and later delivered in our center. Decreased PAPP-A was associated with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and 1.277, p < 0.005. Elevated AFP was associated with PTD, maternal blood administration, IUGR and low 5-minute Apgar-score, OR =2.044, 1.95, 1.452 and 1.22, respectively, p < 0.033. Decreased HCG in second trimester was correlated with IUGR, OR =1.346, p < 0.05. Elevated HCG in second trimester was correlated with PTD and newborn NICU admission, OR =1.192, 1.285, respectively, p < 0.015. In both rst and second trimesters, elevated HCG was associated with preeclampsia, OR =1.169, 1.309, respectively, p < 0.05. Low estriol was correlated with IUGR, OR =3.597, p < 0.001. After controlling for confounders (age, ethnicity, IVF, parity, etc.) most associa- tions remained signi cant. Discussion: Despite superiority of NIPS for Down Syndrome screening, biochemical screening is still valuable for prediction of pregnancy complications. Identifying women with high-risk pregnancies has clinical implicationsfor prenatal care and risk-reducing management strategies. R. Michaelson-Cohen: None. A. Lahad: None. P01.034.A Use of prenatal exome sequencing in fetuses with ultrasound anomalies M. Segura-Puimedon , B. Campos, J. Luna, C. Sintas, M. D\u00edez, B. Laboratories, qGenomics, Barcelona, Spain, Esplugues de Llobregat, Spain Introduction : Whole exome sequencing (WES) is an established diagnostic tool in postnatal settings for indivi- duals with a suspected genetic condition. Recently, it is increasingly used as a diagnostic tool in prenatal settings aswell. We present here our experience using this technology in fetuses with ultrasound anomalies.150 J. del PicchiaMaterial and Methods : WES was performed in 166 fetal samples with ultrasound anomalies. 104 samples were from evolutive pregnancies and 62 were from legal interruptions or stillbirths. In 61 samples, previous prenatal CGH-array was performed with negative result. Segregation studies were performed in cases with a candidate variant whenpossible. Results: Common reasons for referral were skeletal anomalies, polymalformated fetuses, cerebral anomalies orspecic syndrome suspicion. Pathogenic or likely patho- genic variants of unknown signi cance were identi ed, and in 13 of them inheritance was consistent with expected pattern, including a probable mosaicism case. In half of the cases (50,6%) no candidatevariant was identi ed. Diagnostic yield was higher in fetuses with skeletal anomalies, where pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identi ed in ( n=10) 31% of cases, and in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency or hidrops (Noonan syndrome suspicion), where a pathogenic variant was found in 24% ( n=6) of the samples. No pathogenic variants were with cardiovas- cular anomalies ( n=9). Conclusions: Exome sequencing is a valuable diagnostic tool in fetuses with ultrasound anomalies, especially when skeletal anomalies are present or when Noonan syndrome is suspected. M.

Tran Mau Them1,2, A. Bruel1,2, France,9Service Center for Devel- opmental Disorders, F 76000, Normandy Center for France Introduction : Exome sequencing (ES) is the most powerful and current test for patients with developmental abnormal-ities (DA). It has considerably been deployed in postnatal indications with a diagnostic yield ranging from 30 to 40%. Several prenatal studies report a diagnostic yield rangingfrom 15% to 35%, depending on the exome strategy and the inclusion criteria. The French national network for rareAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 151diseases with AD deployed a pilot project of feasibility for rapid prenatal exome sequencing. Materials and methods: We aimed to include 61 fetuses and both parents. The main inclusion criteria were: 2 major malformations or, 1 major and 1 minor malformation or, 1 malformation and a strong genetic suspicion. The feasibilityaim was to emit a diagnostic report in 5-6 weeks. Array- CGH and ES-trio were concomitantly performed. ES-trio was captured with the TWIST-v2 kit and sequenced on aNovaSeq6000 device with a 70X average depth. Results : We included 23 patients. The turnaround time from receipt of samples to the diagnostic report was onaverage of 27 days for the negative patients and of 40 days for the positive patients. The diagnostic yield was of 44% with 7 SNV and 3 CNV, including a tetrasomy 12p. Array-CGH allowed a diagnosis in and exome Results were concordant for CNV between array- CGH and ES-trio. Discussion : Prenatal trio-ES appears feasible in a useful time and strongly helpful for decision in 65 % and genetic counseling was impactful in at least 44%. F. Tran Mau Them: None. A. Bruel: None.

P01.036.C Preconception carrier screening Abul\u00ed , E. Hospital Vall d 'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain Consanguineous couples have an increased risk of severe abnormalities and mortality in offspring due to autosomal recessive disorders. Exome-sequencing provides the possi- bility of wide preconception carrier screening (PCS) inconsanguineous couples who may be at risk of rare genetic disorders. The ef cacy of this strategy has been poorly explored. We retrospectively analyzed exome sequencingdata from 27 affected children and 3 fetuses (after termi- nation of pregnancy) of consanguineous couples. We explored diagnostic yield and carrier status for recessivedisorders. Overall diagnostic yield was 67% (20/30 patients). We detected homozygous causative variants in 19cases and one de novo heterozygous variant. Out of 20 causal variants, 18 were classi ed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and two as unknown signi cance, which were reclassi ed as likely pathogenic because of highly speci c phenotype. Based on our results and considering diagnostic yield and variant classi cation, causative pathogenic recessive mutations would have been detected in at least 60% of consanguineous couples by preconception exome- sequencing. Most of these conditions (16/20) would nothave been detected in PCS panels for most prevalent dis- eases considering a carrier frequency of 1/250. Most of the patients were carriers of one additional heterozygousrecessive mutation (70%, 21/30) and a smaller number were carriers of two (17%, 5/30) or more (13%, 4/30). The average carrier burden of autosomal recessive conditionswas of 1.7 pathogenic mutations per patient. PCS by exome-sequencing increases the detection rate of rare recessive conditions in consanguineous couples and couldpotentially increase their reproductive autonomy and facil- itate informed decision making.

P01.037.A Does maternal blood exosomal DNA effective for the fetal RHD andSRY Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey,2Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Okmeydan Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Recent advances have led to the develop- ment of important techniques in extracellular fetal DNA derived from maternal blood for prenatal diagnosis. Exo-somes 'DNA content is not affected structurally by nuclease activity and have a potential clinical application. Determi- nation of fetal Rhesus D(RhD) and sex is important forprenatal diagnosis in some diseases. Material And Method: Fetal RHD andSRY genotyping was performed using exosomal DNA(exoDNA) blood of 81 RhD negative pregnant women with exosome isolation kit. Speci c primers were applied for ampli cations by Real-Time poly- merase chain reaction. The average age of the cases in the study was 28.5 \u00b1 5.5(year \u00b1 SD). The mean gestational week of the cases was 25.81 \u00b1 9.02. The exoDNAconcentrations obtained were between 1.8-21.9 an average of 11.65 \u00b1 8.08 ng/ L.152 J. del PicchiaResults: The results were con rmed with the hospital 's New Born Follow Up System. After analysis of the 81 cases, no ampli cation was observed in 16 samples, including the GAPDH gene. 100% accuracy was achieved in the RHD and SRY detection from the remaining 65 samples. Conclusions: It was determined that fetal RHD andSRY genotyping could be performed with exoDNA from maternal plasma. The isolation technique of exoDNA couldbe enhanced and improved for high concentration with more sensitive detection covering early pregnancy age. This technique might provide a new perspective to the prenataldiagnosis as well as to the treatment options all which require more detailed studies.

S\u00f6zer: preconception screening for severe recessive disorders: Does a GP-provided test offer with couple results meet criteria for responsible implementation? J. Schuurmans 1,2, M. Plantinga1, E. Birnie1, K. M. Abbott1, A. D. Diemers1, D. M. Van der Kolk1, L. M. Van den Heuvel1, M. Y. Berger1, M. Verkerk1, A. Fenwick2,A carrier screening (ECS) enables the identi cation of couples who are at increased risk of having children with recessive conditions. Based on pre-liminary research, we conducted a pilot study of GP- provided population-based preconception ECS (2016-2018) to evaluate whether this approach would meet criteria forresponsible implementation as speci ed by Henneman et al., EJHG, 2016. The free test-offer consisted of 50 severe early-onset childhood conditions. Only couple-results were reported. We discuss key insights to guide large-scale implementation. Methods: We used a mixed-methods approach. Trained GPs from nine practices invited their female patients ( n= 4295, aged 18-40) and partners. We addressed uptake, feasibility (e.g. pre-test counselling possible within 20 min-utes), informed-choice, psychological outcomes (e.g. anxi- ety, decisional con flict) and reproductive intentions using a longitudinal survey (couples) and semi-structuredinterviews (GPs).Results: 190 couples were included. 130 (approximately 15% of the eligible population) accepted the test-offer within one month and attended pre-test counselling. 117 (90%) proceeded with testing. More than 90% of test- participants made an informed-choice. GPs felt con dent to conduct counselling, although having to make a GP-appointment with both partners was a barrier. Most participants reported low anxiety and decisional con flict; this was relatively higher in test-offer decliners thanacceptors. Conclusions: Population-based preconception ECS for a specic set of severe conditions provided by motivated and trained GPs is feasible. We will discuss how responsible implementation can best be facilitated. The possibility of prenatal ECS, ECS to high-risk couples or which HCPsshould offer this (e.g. midwives, fertility clinics) should now also be investigated. J. Schuurmans: None. M. Plantinga: None.

Ryan Natera, Inc, San Carlos, CA, United States Objective: Retrospective analysis to determine if differ- ences in fetal fraction (FF) are observed in donor oocyte pregnancies compared to the general population. Methods: Noninvasive prenatal testing samples from singleton pregnancies were analyzed at a single reference lab. NIPT was performed using a SNP-based method withFF measured as previously described. 1FF from 1611 donor oocytes was analyzed and compared to a large set of reference cases matched for maternal weight (MW) andgestational age (GA). A z-score was calculated for each donor oocyte compared to its reference data. If no impact to FF from the use of donor or in vitro fertilization (IVF), theaverage z-score is expected to be zero. Statistical analysis was performed using a z-test to establish if this was the case. Results: The average z-score for the donor oocyte cases was -0.4. A z-test determined this deviation from normal to be signi cant (p < 0.00001), indicating lower FF in donor oocyte cases vs. corresponding reference data.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 153Conclusions: Previous studies have reported lower FF in patients undergoing IVF and in donor oocyte populations.2,3 Lower FF has also been associated with increased MW,early GA, certain maternal health conditions, and abnormal fetal results (T18/T13/triploidy). 2,3,4Our results reveal statistically signi cant lower FF in donor oocyte pregnan- cies compared to matched reference data.

FMRpolyG expression in granulosa cells (GCs) of FXPOI-model-mice leads to perturbedovarian function. However, the expression of FMRpolyG in leukocytes and GCs of women with different ovarian response and variable CGG repeat length has not beeninvestigated yet. We performed Western-blot (WB) to analyze the expression of FMRP and FMRpolyG in patient \u00b4s leukocytes and GCs with -gene- we detected FMRP, both in leukocytes and GCs of women with variable ovarian reserveand different CGG-repeat-length. FMR1 /FMRP was detec- ted in a larger amount in GCs than in leukocytes, since it is a major regulator of folliculogenesis. We therefore started a pilot project investigating if variable expression-levels of FMRP and FMRpolyG detected by WB can be related to women with different ovarian reserve parameters and vari-able CGG repeats including \"normal \"and premutated ran- ges. Preliminary data already showed, in a PM patient undergoing oocytes cryopreservation because of her risk ofdeveloping FXPOI, a decreased level of FMRP, even though the FMR1 transcription level was within the normal range, tting to the hypothesis of kind of a perturbed protein production in this patient. We plan to further evaluate if results made in GCs can be translated to leukocytes. This would offer prospectively a predictive tool or marker ofprogression. X. Nguyen: None. B. Messmer: None. K.

SNVs in these genes have been investigated in mostly infertile couples undergoing IVF, in search of potential biomarkers of IVFsuccess. Recently, maternal SNVs in infertile women (rs1801133/rs1801131 in MTHFR rs2305957 INTU-SLC25A31-HSPA4L-PLK4- MFSD8-LARP1B and PGRMC2 ) were associated with embryo quality or chromosomal status. We investigated the potential association of SNVs in 26 selected genes witha possible role in preimplantation development, with oocyte/embryo quality in fertile women undergoing154 J. del PicchiaPreimplantation Genetic Testing for Monogenic Disorder (PGT-M).

Whilst causes such as Kline- felter 's and Y chromosome microdeletions have been well distinguished, the genetic causes behind severe spermato- genic failure are largely unknown, with around 40% of all male infertility cases remaining idiopathic. De novo muta-tions (DNMs) arise spontaneously in the germline or post- zygotically, and are known to be associated with early onset disorders with reduced reproductive tness. These muta- tions, however, are vastly understudied in the eld of male infertility due to the dif culty in obtaining parental samples. Here we report on the continuation and expansion of exomesequencing in our cohort of infertile patients in order to identify novel genes involved in male infertility. The role of DNMs was investigated in a total of 194 patients sufferingfrom non-obstructive azoospermia or severe oligozoos- permia and their fertile parents by adding 95 additional trios to the previously reported 99 cases. In these additional 95trios, we have identi ed and validated 75 protein-altering DNMs, of which 19 are likely to affect normal gene func- tion. Genes of particular interest are PPP1R7 ,RBM5 and MSH5 , all of which are involved in spermatogenesis and linked to infertility in mice. At this moment, none of these genes have been recognised as human male infertility genes.Our data further indicates that DNMs may play an impor- tant role in severe male infertility and emphasises the need for further replication studies in larger cohorts.

P01.049.A A case report of a rare nonsense ZP1variant in a patient with oocyte maturation defect E. G. Berkay , B. Karaman, B. Ozsait Selcuk, Z. O. Uyguner, S. Basaran Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Oocyte maturation defect (OOMD) is a rare condition causing female infertility that can be diagnosedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 155during assisted reproduction ,PATL2 ,TUBB8 , WEE2 (OMIM, 2020). We report a case of a 31-year-old woman who had four ART failures diagnosed as empty follicle syndrome and OOMD. She has short stature (-3 SD), bilateral limited extension- flexion on elbows. Materials and Methods: Chromosome analysis and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using cells investigated. Whole- exome sequencing (WES) performed via the Illumina platform. Con rmation and familial segregation analysis were performed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Karyotyping and FISH resulted in normal, possible mosaicism was excluded. WES analysis revealeda known, rare, pathogenic homozygous variant in exon 3 (c.628C>T; p.Q210*) of ZP1 gene, and her parents being rst degree cousins were carriers for this variant. Conclusions: ZP1with autosomal is essentialfor oocyte development. ZP contains four types of receptor proteins (ZP1-4). Our variant in ZP1 is nonsense, premature stop codon causes to truncate ZP1 receptor proteins. This istherst homozygous occurrence of this variant associated with OOMD. WES ndings were also analyzed for known genes related to short stature and no pathogenic variant hasbeen observed. WES is a valuable method to identify the genetic origin in complex, multigenic conditions like in infertility. Istanbul University Project-Number:TSA-2018-32135 E.G. Berkay: None. B. Karaman: None.

B. translocations are rare events in cytogenetics, characterised by a donor chromosome and multiplerecipient chromosomes. To date, only ten prenatal cases have been described. Patient: This pregnancy was a second spontaneous pregnancy of a non-consanguinous couple. A rst trimester ultrasound showed an increased nuchal translucency persisting at 18 gestational weeks (GW) along withretrognatia, cleft palate and femoral shortening. Choriocent- esis performed at 14 GW. Results: Direct examination on cytotrophoblast found a der(18)t(18;18) whereas the cultured karyotype on mesenchyme showed a der(18)t(2;18). Due to tissue discordance, an amiocentesis was performed at 18 GW.Surprisingly, we found, neither of the two previously identi ed cell lines, but a mosaic der(18)t(12;18) with a ring 18. In addition, array CGH provided breakpoints forchromosomes 2 and 12 in REEP1 (12q24.23) (Nanopore) was conducted toclarify breakpoint in chromosome 18. Using data obtained by array CGH, a long read with hard clipping showed a breakpoint in repeated sequence with about 90% homologywith D18Z1 alpha satellite. Finally, all identi ed cell lines carried a 18p monosomy which could explain ultrasound abnormalities. The pregnancy was terminated. Followingfetal autopsy, FISH analysis was performed on blood, thymic, lung and liver tissue and con rmed 18p monosomy in all tissues. Conclusion: We report here a new case of jumping translocation with precise molecular characterization of breakpoints : D18Z1 as donor region and at least 3 recipientchromosomes : 2p11.2, 12q24.3 and None.

Associated with that, asignicantly reduced life span has been observed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Klinefelter patients show molecular signs of premature ageing. Patients and Methods: We assessed age-associated DNA methylation patterns (by pyrosequencing) and relative telomere length (TL; by quantitative polymerase chainreaction) as molecular ageing biomarkers in blood from Klinefelter patients ( n=178 and 266 for DNA methylation 18-71 years. Age-matchedhealthy and and ( n=50) served as controls. Results: Age-associated DNA methylation patterns did not indicate accelerated ageing/premature ageing in men with Klinefelter syndrome. In young 18-24 years, we observed signi cantly longer telomeres compared to controls (mean =1.51 vs. 1.09 and 1.26 in female and male controls, respectively).Telomere length in subsequent age groups, however, were not signi cantly different to controls. Conclusions: We did not nd molecular hints for premature ageing in Klinefelter patients based on DNA methylation patterns. However, we observed higher base- line TL at adolescent age but comparable TL withprogressive age in other age groups. Whether this is due to an accelerated TL attrition, putatively related to the observed co-morbidities in Klinefelter syndrome, remains tobe addressed in a further longitudinal study.

However, of all infertile men, 40% have unknown aetiology after being tested for all known causes. In this study, we explored for the rst time the role of maternally inherited copy-number variations (CNVs) on a large scale, sequencing the exome of 160 patient-parents trios, a methodology primarily used to detect singlenucleotide variants (SNVs) but also robust for CNV detection. Among all rare maternally inherited CNVs detected, 3 were considered of potential pathogenicity. Oneis a large duplication (~1.7 Mb) involving, among others, VCX gene, an X-linked multi-copy gene that leads to apoptosis and cell growth inhibition when duplicated inmurine germ cells in vitro. A second case carried a ~80 kb duplication involving two genes, one of which was FAS,a known regulator of testicular germ cell apoptosis. The thirdCNV, instead, was a deletion of ~200 kb affecting, among others, PSME4 , a gene required for normal fertility in male mice but dispensable in females. The results of this study,although preliminary, provide a rst indication that mater- nally inherited CNVs may explain cases of severe sper- matogenic failure. Currently, additional 35 patient-parentstrios and 149 patients are being screened to detect variations affecting the same genes and additional rare variations. Genome sequencing data will soon be available for all thetrios, which will improve CNV detection and clarify the contribution of these variations to the disorder. F.K. Mastrorosa: None. M.J.

A genetic diagnosis combined with a clearunambiguous description of accompanying testis histology will hugely bene t interpretation of the function of identi- ed genes. However, a universal ontology for testis histo- pathology is lacking. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a formal ontology, which describes phenotypes encountered in human diseases. The HPO allows phenotypedriven differential diagnostics in clinical routine and research. The current hierarchy of terms regarding azoos- permia, is not a systematical one. Moreover, the majority oftesticular phenotypes are not annotated yet. Building on what has been published previously and our own experience we propose a framework for testis histopathology thatconsists of ve main categories. Four of these are sub- divided to obtain information on the timing of a germ cell arrest or the severity of overall loss of spermatogenesis. Toestablish a lower threshold for complete spermatogenesis we determined the number of tubules containing elongating spermatids in a collection of samples of men with anobstructive azoospermia due to a previous vasectomy (N=117). This analysis suggested 50% to be a reasonable cut-off to distinguish hypospermatogenesis from completespermatogenesis. The framework is easy to understand and straightforward in its application. It gathers most relevant information to study the impact of an identi ed mutation on spermatogenesis. We conclude that once this framework is incorporated in the HPO, the standardized vocabulary will facilitate communication and interpretation in both a clinicalroutine and research.

P01.057.C Identi cation of two mutations, in the male reproductive tract speci c-defensin 126/128 genes, potentially underlie a severe sperm dysfunction .S. Kane 1, D. Lester1, S. Cameron1, C. Barratt2, S. Martins da Silva2, S. 1School Science, Engineering & Technology, Abertay University, Dundee, United Kingdom,2Reproductive and Developmental Biology, School of Medicine, NinewellsHospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom Introduction: Idiopathic infertility affects 15% couples globally and recent evidence suggests genetic abnormalities are a causative factor in a signi cant number of cases. Hence, we conducted whole exome sequencing of men undergoing assisted conception to identify genetic lesions. The -defensin 126 (DEFB126) and -defensin 128 (DEFB128), are genes preferentially expressed in the epi- didymis, where these proteins may help protect the matur- ing sperm cells and play a vital role during spermcapacitation. Materials and Methods: DNA extracted from the blood of 26 unrelated, sub-fertile men were sequenced usingwhole exome sequencing. Pathogenic rare variants were identi bioinformatics analysis and validated using Sanger sequencing. Results: A novel and rare homozygous pathogenic 1-bp frame-shift insertion causing a premature stop codon was identi ed in DEFB128 gene from one patient. Six patients showed a previously reported homozygous 2bp deletion, causing a frame-shift mutation in the DEFB126 gene (p. Pro106ArgfsTer?). All patients ascertained with theDEFB126/DEFB128 mutations were unable to naturally conceive and hence were sub-fertile. Conclusions: The DEFB128 mutation (rs11396059), is rare and has not been associated with any disease to date. As the patient with the DEFB128 mutation has no other medical condition we predict that it is the cause ofinfertility. The DEFB126 mutation (rs140685149), is a common variant, and this homozygous variant in sub-fertile men has previously been implicated in facilitating spermmovement in the female reproductive tract. These results suggest that, -defensin genes play a signi cant role in male reproduction. This work was supported by the R-LINCS studentship, Abertay University. S. Kane: None. D. Lester: None.

Material and Methods: We collected swim-up sperm samples from 40 normozoospermic and 93 oligoasthenoter- atozoospermic patients and determined H19 and MEST methylation levels by deep bisul te sequencing. Based on this screening, we de ned three groups: normal controls (NC), abnormally methylated infertile (AMI; n=7) performed whole genome bisul te sequencing of ve NC, ve AMI and six NMI samples. Results: Whole-genome comparison of NC and AMI samples revealed that each AMI sample had abnormal methylation levels of all 50 imprinting control regions and>2,000 germ cell-speci c genes with distinct DNA methylation differences in blood and germ cells. This is consistent with the presence of somatic cell DNA in AMIsamples. The comparison of NC and NMI samples revealed 19 differentially methylated regions, none of which could be validated in an independent cohort of 40 men. Analysisof the H19 CTCF-binding region 6 in samples without somatic cell DNA revealed an association between DNA methylation levels and genotype (rs2071094), but notfertility phenotype. Conclusions: Our results suggest that somatic DNA contamination and genetic variation confound methylationstudies in sperm of infertile men and that the prevalence of aberrant methylation in infertile men has been over- estimated, which is reassuring for patients undergoingassisted reproduction.

The need of invasive procedure signi cantly contributes to late diagnosis and less effective treatment. The aim of this study is to screen for changes in miRNAs expression in peripheral blood that could be furtherresearched as potential non-i nvasive diagnostic tool for endometriosis. Materials and methods: 15 patients with surgically conrmed advanced endometriosis and 15 healthy controls were included in the study. Peripheral blood samples were collected after signed informed consent. Plasma RNA wasisolated with miRNeasy-Serum/Plasma Kit in conjunction with Plasma Spike-in-Control (Qiagen \u00ae). Equimolar amounts of RNA were used to prepare two pools: 1)latestage endometriosis and 2)healthy controls. Reverse transcription of the pool samples was performed by miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen \u00ae). Expression spectra on Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument. Results: The preliminary results revealed 65 upregulated miRNAs and no downregulated miRNAs between cases andcontrols. The fold change between 5 and 10 was detected in 21 miRNAs and fold change above 10 was detected in 44 miRNAs. The most signi cantly overexpressed miRNAs were miR-106a and with cell proliferation and apoptosis. Conclusions: MiRNA expression level differences were found in blood between endometriosis patients and healthy controls. This may lay the foundations for future in-depth research on novel non-invasive biomarker for endometrio-sis. Acknowledgements: Contract -212/12.12.2018 V. Spasova: Anto- nova: None. Z.

Hucke2, R\u00f6mer3, ment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wuppertal, Germany, 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, K\u00f6ln-Weyertal, Germany,4Division of Gynecology, Poznan, Poland,5Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hannover, Germany M\u00fcllerian anomalies include formation, fusion or absorp- tion defects of the M\u00fcllerian ducts such as bicornuate as the Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS) which is characterized by the congenital absence of uterus and vagina. The incidence of MRKHS is estimatedto be 1:4.500 and 1:250 in other M\u00fcllerian anomalies. Most cases of M\u00fcllerian anomalies are sporadic; familial cases seem to be autosomal dominant inherited with reducedpenetrance. Until now the knowledge about the etiology of anomalies of the M\u00fcllerian ducts is very limited. In approximately 1% of patients with M\u00fcllerian anomaliesrecurrent deletions in 16p11.2 encompassing TBX6 were found as causative in these patients. Moreover, in previous studies, we and others found possibly pathogenic variants inpatients with M\u00fcllerian anomalies in TBX6 . conserved transcription factor playing essen- tial in developmental processes like mesoderm forma-tion and speci cation, we suggested TBX6 as strong candidate gene. Thus we performed analysis of the TBX6 gene (NM_004608) in additional 126 patients with M\u00fcl-lerian anomalies. We detected 4 possibly could exclude the previously reported variant c.484G>A p.(Gly162Ser) as being causative for disorders of the M\u00fcllerian ducts in theEuropean non-Finnish population.

P01.062.B Circulating fetal trophoblastic cell eligible for NIPD: the exception rather than the rule L. Cayrefourcq 1,M. Vincent2, de of Strasbourg, Schiltigheim, Medical Medical Center of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France,7Service de Genetique Medicale_University Medical Center of Nice, Nice, France, de Genetique Medicale_University Medical Center of Toulouse, Toulouse, Medicale_Medical Center of Saint Brieuc, France Introduction: Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD), based on the analysis of circulating cell-free fetal DNA (cff-DNA), is successfully implemented for an increasing number of monogenic diseases. However, technical issues related to cff-DNA characteristics remain, and not allmutations can be screened with this method, particularly triplet expansion mutations that frequently concern prenatal diagnosis requests. The objective of this study was todevelop an approach to isolate and analyze Circulating Trophoblastic Fetal Cells (CFTCs) for NIPD of monogenic diseases caused by triplet repeat expansion or pointmutations. Materials and Methods: We developed a method for CFTC isolation based on DEPArray TMsorting and used Huntington 's disease as the clinical model for CFTC-based NIPD. Then, we investigated whether CFTC isolation and Whole Genome Ampli cation (WGA) could be used for NIPD in couples at risk of transmitting different monogenic diseases. Results: Our data showed that the allele drop-out rate was 3-fold higher in CFTCs than in maternal cells processed in the same way. Moreover, we gave new insights into CFTCs by compiling data obtained by extensive molecular testingby Conclusions: CFTCs appear to be often characterized by a random state of genomic degradation. This might challenge CFTC use for routine NIPD. This emphasizes the importance to have not a single diagnostic cell butmultiple diagnostic cells.

Schwitzgebel1 1University Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland, 2H\u00f4pital du Valais, Sion, Switzerland Introduction: The presence of foetal DNA in maternal plasma allows for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis ofMendelian diseases, through detection of known parental mutations. While identifying paternal mutations is straightforward, determining whether a maternal mutation ispresent in the foetus requires relative dosage of maternal haplotypes (RHDO), via heterozygous SNPs on either side of the mutation. Results: A custom library of 95 SNPs spread over a ~1 Mb region around the FBN1 gene was used for a posteriori analysis of two pregnancies in a couple with a paternalFBN1:c.5143delA mutation causing Marfan syndrome. In both cases, the mutation was detected in maternal plasma and con rmed in amniotic fluid or cord blood. We also veried that the method could determine which maternal haplotype each foetus had inherited. In another couple with a maternal GCK:p.Gly246Arg mutation causing MODY2, a panel of 99 SNPs over 0.7 Mb around GCK was used to analyse maternal plasma at 16 and 30 weeks gestation. In both samples, we correctlydetermined the maternal haplotype inherited by the foetus and diagnosed the presence of the mutation, con rmed by cord blood DNA analysis. The same results were obtainedby quantifying the number of DNA molecules, obtained through molecular barcodes, rather than sequence reads. Bioinformatic reduction of foetal fractions showed thatdetermination of maternal haplotypes remained possible down to 4.3% foetal DNA. Conclusions: Although preliminary, our results indicate that a molecular barcode library of ~100 SNPs is adequate to achieve non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of monogenic diseases, even at low foetal fractions.

A substantial proportion of these CNVs are associated with severe diseases, even with some newly identi ed microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Recently it was showed that NIPT has a good performance in detecting fetal subchromosomal CNVs, especially for CNVs >10 Mb, and can be incorporated intothe routine NIPT chromosomal aneuploidies screening with high sensitivity and speci city. The prenatal detection of CNVs with clinical signi cance would bene t all the pregnant women in genetic counselling and clinical man- agement of the pregnant outcomes. We report here a result from NIPT performed in a rst trimester of a pregnant woman with third normal pregnancy. The test revealed 5Mbp-13q duplication and array CGH was indicated for conrmation of the aberration after amniocentesis. Array CGH con rmed the aberration in a fetus with the following size: 13q21.2q21.31 (60,540,987-65,431,854)x3 (4.89 Mb). Such duplications in 13q are described in the literature to beassociated with the developmental delay, intellectual de - cits, behavioral problems, and facial dysmorphisms. We tested all family members by array CGH for the presence ofthe aberrations - the parents and two siblings (9 years old girl and 12 years old boy). The same aberration was detected in clinically healthy mother and sister, thus deter-mining the familial character of the aberration. In conclu- sion, careful evaluation should be done for each submiscroscopic aberration detected by NIPT in order tomake proper classi cation and give an adequate genetic counselling. I. Dimova: None.

P01.067.A False positive trisomy 21 NIPT-result due to maternal inherited Introduction: Noninvasive prenatal tests (NIPT) are screening methods to detect fetal aneuploidies with high speci city and sensitivity. Nevertheless, maternal factors as copy number variations (CNV) are reasons fo r discrepancies between NIPT- results and fetal karyotypes. We report a case with a con-spicuous trisomy 21 result aft er NIPT, an unsuspicious fetal ultrasound and a normal karyotype following conventional chromosome analysis (CA) of amniotic fluid cells. Material and Methods: Next Generation sequencing (NGS) of cfDNA, CA from peripheral blood, amniotic fluid placental cells, indicated fetal trisomy 21. In contrast, ultrasound examination and amniocentesis showed normal results. Reanalysis of NIPT by WISECONDOR algorithm showed a 10 Mb gain on chromosome 21. No comparablecases were described in literature or databases. The parents declined further diagnostics until birth. Postpartum CA and FISH from blood and placental cells resulted in normalkaryotypes. In contrast, aCGH con rmed a 1,44 Mb gain in chromosomal region 21q21.3q22.11 and the aberration was classi ed as variant of unclear signi cance (VUS). Addi- tional qPCR analyses con rmed the gain and showed it was maternal inherited. Therefore, we reclassi ed the aberration as a familial benign CNV. Conclusions: To best of our knowledge, this is the rst report of a small benign maternal chromosome 21 CNV leading to a false positive trisomy 21 NIPT result. That casedemonstrates again the importance of a critical re flection of genotype/phenotype correlations after NIPT. M. Blankenburg: None. A. None. S. Rauschke: None. R. Becker: None. K.

PicchiaNon-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) methods are widely used as screening tool for fetal aneuploidies. They are based on the isolation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma which for the majority is maternal, but a small percentage of it comes from the placenta (cell-free fetal DNA or cffDNA). cffDNA percentage or fetal fraction (FF)ranges from < 4% to >30% and it in fluences NIPT out- come. According to neoBona \u00aeNIPT method used in our laboratory, invalidation occurs with a FF <4%. Recently,circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been investigated as potential biomarkers for screening in pregnancy. We aimed to investigate them as biomarkers in relation to FFlevel. Previously tested neoBona \u00aesamples were divided into one \"(FF one \"test the nanostring nCounter \u00ae platform by using a pre-customised panel of 799 miRNAs. Each miRNA expression value was normalised to 1 in the \"control group \"and\"test group \"samples were analysed for expression defects. Data ltering was set using 1.5-fold of changes in signal as threshold. Ninety-three per cent of miRNAs showed no signi cant changes of expression whilst 4 analysis showed involvement of these miR-NAs and their target genes in several biological pathways. Further investigations of these preliminary data could pro- vide a new insight into the biological roles of the miRNAsin relation to FF level and in their potential use as biomarkers. G.

Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to investigate the risk for fetal aneuploidies (chromosomes 13, 18 e 21 trisomies and X/Y aneuploidies) has been demon-strated to have high sensitivity and speci city and it is worldwide accepted both as contingent screening as primary test in rst trimester. Materials and Methods: since March 2019, NIPT is offered by public healthcare system in Tuscany to pregnant women with conventional rst trimester screening test (FTS) risk (nuchal translucency and biochemical measure- ments) ranging from 1:301-1:1000 or 1:2-1:300 if they opt- out invasive prenatal diagnosis. Women are counseled indifferent centers spread out over the regional area. Blood samples are collected in a single regional center authorized to perform the test for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y byCE-IVD VeriSeq NIPT Solution (Illumina Inc.). Results: Since March to December 2019, 2199 women have been screened of which 429 with a FTS risk rangingfrom 1:2-1:300 and 940 from 1:301-1:1000. 396 out of 429 NIPT results were at low risk for fetal aneuploidies whereas 7/429 resulted at high n=1)and been con rmed by IPD. In the FTS 1:301-1:1000 risk group, 738 cases resulted at low risk for fetal aneuploidies and 5 at high risk for aneuploidy results have been con rmed by IPD. Conclusions.

SAHIN1 1Genoks Genetic Diseases Diagnostic Center, Ankara, Turkey,2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Divi- sion of Perinatology, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine,Ankara, TurkeyAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 163Objective: When non invasive sequencing (WGS) is per- formed, the autosomal aneuploidies other than trisomy 21, 18 and 13 has the potential to be detected. We present the frequency of rare chromosomal trisomies (RATs) that were identi ed between 1 July 2018 and 31 December 2019 Methods: Standard centrifugation methods were used for plasma isolation. Cell free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated and library construction was prepared according to BGI 's documented protocol. WGS of cfDNA was performed with BGISEQ-500 sequencer. Data 's proprietary Results: WGS data was generated from 13,802 NIPT cases. The mean maternal age was 33 years, fetal fraction was 10.7% and gestational age at testing was 14 weeks.Over an 18-month period, there were 30 RATs identi ed. The overall frequency of RATs was 0.21% in our study. Trisomies 16 and 22 were the most frequently observedRATs while other chromosomes were less frequently involved. Invasive prenatal diagnosis was performed in 37% (11/30) of cases with RATs. Three fetal aneuploidieswere con rmed with amniocentesis; one was T16 and the others were T22. Conclusions: Rare autosomal aneuploidies are not uncommon in clinical practice when performing genome- wide NIPT. The review of the published reports show a signicant risk for obstetric pathology and fetal anomalies such as early miscarriage, true fetal mosaicism, intrauterine growth restriction, in utero fetal demise, and uniparental disomy. We advise genetic counseling in all cases of rarechromosomal trisomies to improve pregnancy management. I.M. Tekin: None. H. Ozdemir: None. H. Ozgur: None. Y. Sahin: None.

Delhanty1 1Preimplantation Genetics Group, University College London, London, United Kingdom,2Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Igenomix UK Ltd, London, London, UnitedKingdom, 3Embryology Department, The Centre For Reproductive and Genetic Health, London, United King- dom,4Clinical Department, The Centre For Reproductive and Genetic Health, London, United Kingdom As women age the risk of an aneuploid oocyte increaseswith most errors affecting meiosis I/II. Application of next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed us to con rm our nding, from molecular cytogenetics, that a signi cant proportion of apparently meiotic aneuploidy is in fact pre- sent in the early embryo, leading to a risk of oocyte aneu- ploidy irrespective of age. It has also provided evidence thatgenetic factors in fluence premeiotic oocyte aneuploidy. Mature oocytes (27) were metaphase II - 1st polar body complexes. Totally, 111 oocytes from 33 women, (averagematernal age, 35.09 years) were tested. Overall 15/111 (13.5%) oocytes showed premeiotic (PM) errors. Eight of 33 patients had oocytes with PM errors. Aneuploidy ana-lysis was based on the reproductive histories of female partners donating oocytes. Interestingly the rst two groups of infertility patients showed almost identical aneuploidyrates in contrast to the social oocyte freezing group. Two young women preserving oocytes prior to breast cancer treatment showed complex aneuploidies. We conclude thatthe application of NGS has provided accurate information regarding the frequency of aneuploidy that is due to pre- meiotic errors compared with that caused by errors at MI ofoogenesis and that on an individual basis this is in fluenced by genetic factors.

Newcastle Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom,2Department of Human Genetics, Donders Institute for Brain Cognition andBehavior, Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands Male infertility affects approximately 7% of the male population and while genetic abnormalities are predicted to make up at least 15% of the cases, only ~4% are currently identi ed. In severe forms of male infertility, patients are found to have high numbers of genetic abnormalities and de novo mutations (DNMs). Interestingly DNMs are known to play an important role in severe genetic diseases withreduced reproductive tness. Our research investigates the role of DNMs in severe male infertility by studying a unique cohort of azoospermic and severe oligozoospermicpatients, and their fertile parents. Employing the Illumina 's Novaseq6000, 100 DNMs were identi ed in the exomes of 99 patients. While short-read sequencing data was used tocollect the location and genotypes of all informative SNPs (iSNPs) surrounding the DNMs, limitations in fragment size prevented further investigation. In-depth examination ofDNMs in context with their surrounding iSNPs requires targeted capture approaches for long-read sequencing that span the entire region of interest. Using PCR ampliconsequencing on the Oxford-Nanopore MinION platform we have been able to phase ~90% of the DNMs. Phasing analysis indicated that ~71% of DNMs occurred in thepaternal gamete pre-fertilization, which is in concordance with current literature. A link between paternal DNMs and likely causation for disease has been noted, though not alldata was available for this association at this time. Inves- tigation of allele frequency identi ed 91% of the DNMs occurred pre-zygotically, why they failed to impact fatherspermatogenesis is of particular interest for further study. G.S. Holt: None.

P01.082.A Polycystic ovary syndrome: Does it affect the expression in human oocytes?P. Tulay , Z. Al-Omar, B. Ozbakir Near East University, Nicosia, CyprusPolycystic ovary syndrome is a common disorder among women of reproductive age. The aim of this study was toinvestigate the gene expression levels of a number of genes that is functioning in steroidogenesis and in the main- tenance of telomeres. The spare oocytes were collected from IVF patients with polycystic ovaries and routine IVF patients as controls. DNA and RNA were extracted from each oocyte. Reversetranscription of RNA was performed and real time PCR was conducted to quantify the expression levels the expression levels ofTERT ,TRF,TINF ,TPP,RAP, CYP19 andHSD3B2 were similar between the two groups. However, the expression levels of POT and CYP11A1 genes were shown to be statistically different in the oocytes obtained from controlpatients (p < 0.05), whereas statistically signi cant expres- sion levels were observed for CYP17 in the oocytes obtained from the study group (p < 0.05). The expressionlevel of HSD17B1 was also shown to be statistically different in the oocytes (p < 0.05). The results of this study showed that different gene expression levels are observed in the oocytes obtained from females with polycystic ovaries compared to the controls. The extrapolation of the results indicates that the genesessential in maintaining DNA chromosome end integrity and steroidogenesis are crucial for the correct development of the oocytes. Any variations of the expression levels ofthese genes may result in anomalies of the oocyte maturation. P. Tulay: None. Z. Al-Omar: None. B. Ozbakir: None.

The aim of this study was to further investigate the link between two variants highlighted in GWAS near FLT1 gene (rs4769613, rs12050029; 69kb/ 158kb, respectively) and PE in two independent cohorts. Materials and Methods: The study utilized placental samples from Estonian REPROMETA and HAPPY PREG- NANCY (placentas n =329/1768, respectively) sample sets, including Taqman and case-control testing were conducted in PLINK (linear or logistic regression, covari-ates gestational age, sex). Results: Case-control testing showed an increased risk for PE with rs4769613 C allele in both Estonian samplesets, concordant with the previous study. Meta-analysis across the two cohorts improved the signi cance (OR=1.75, P=2.49\u00d710 3). As a novel nding, no associations between rs4769613 and other gestational complications (gestational diabetes, fetal growth, preterm birth) were detected, which suggests the variant is PE-specic. The gene expression of FLT1 was upregulated placentas carrying CC- and P whereas in maternal serum, sFlt-1 was increased inPE cases in all genotype groups. Conclusions: The study emphasizes the placental rs4769613 as the only known robust and speci c risk variant for PE, modulating placental FLT1 IUT34-12 (Estonian (EuropeanRegional Development Fund) T.

Stepanov Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Tomsk, Russian Federation Introduction: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-speci c complication with the poorly understood etiopathogenesis.There is a hypothesis that the risk to the development of PE may be a consequence of natural selection affecting on placental genes responsible for trophoblast invasion andremodeling of spiral arteries. The aim of this work was to characterize the genetic components of PE by analysis ofregulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in placenta and to detect the role of natural selection in its formation. Materials and Methods: In this report we analyzed 46 rSNPs in 21 DEGs, associated with PE according to the analysis of the transcriptome in 551 patients with PE and718 women with uncomplicated pregnancies of Buryat, Russian and Yakut populations using MassArray iPLEX (Sequenom). For detection of the signals of natural selectionwe used new INSIGHT method. Results: We have detected signi cant associations of PE weak negative selection has being shown for 4 rSNPs in 4 DEGs: rs10985257 in CORO2A SASH1 gene, rs2227262 in NDRG1 gene. It should be noted that these results corresponds to number of evolutionaryhypotheses of the occurrence of PE. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the signi cant role of studied rSNPs of DEGs and their adaptive changes in thehereditary predisposition to PE.

As thedisease negatively affects reproductive success, the risk variants are assumed to be under purifying evolutionary166 J. del Picchiaselection. The amount of low-frequency pathogenic variants has shown to be increased in Finland due to recent bottle- necks, increasing statistical power in genetic studies. We aim to screen for genetic risk factors for PE in the families mainly originating from a northeastern Finland population isolate, and generalise the results for the whole population. Methods : The PE family cohort consists of 15 extended families. DNA is available for 174 family members (mothers: 62 and family-based association analyses with PSEUDOMARKER and PLINK to study segregation of loci with both maternaland fetal phenotypes. We will seek replication of the ndings by association analysis in two Finnish cohorts with genome-wide imputed data available, the FINRISK screen, we identi ed ~35 maternal and 40 fetal candidate loci when using a lenient p-value threshold p < 5x10 5. The FINRISK association analysis showed suggestive replication (p < 5x106) of two of the loci, maternal signal in chr9 close to GAS1 and fetal signal in chr16 in CDH13 . Next steps include association analysis in FINNPEC and meta-analysis in both cohorts to verify these preliminary ndings.

P01.089.B A Retrospective Study of In Vitro Fertilization and Preimplantation Genetic Testing for chromosomal aberrations (PGT-SR and PGT-A) combined Outcome for Reproductive Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium PGT for structural rearrangements (PGT-SR) can be offered to patients carrying an inversion, balanced reciprocal or Robertsonian translocation, and PGT for aneuploidyscreening (PGT-A) to patients with fertility problems or recurrent miscarriages. Selecting against embryos without a chromosomal rearrangement could improve live birth rateswhile reducing miscarriage rates or avoiding birth of an affected child. PGT is an extended, stressful trajectory whileprecise outcome predictions are still hard to grasp. Coun- seling PGT couples remains delicate due to numerous parameters in fluencing outcome. Comparing success rates to (inter)national reference data is part of good clinical practice. PGT technologies evolve at high speed, going from different biopsy timepoints to more extensive geneticmethodologies, making good comparisons dif cult. By detailed evaluation of our in-house data, and comparison to published data from (inter)national clinics, we obtainedadditional insights and can provide couples with more patient-focused information. We performed a retrospective cohort study at the Department for Reproductive Medicineand the Center for Medical Genetics (Ghent University Hospital), including patients who underwent ICSI-IVF (January 2016-April 2019) followed by PGT-SR or PGT-A after trophectoderm biopsy (68 and 90 oocyte retrieval cycles respectively). Making use of comprehensive chro- mosome screening (shallow whole genome sequencing orsWGS), we detected abnormalities in 65% of PGT-SR embryos. In the PGT-A group, 40% of embryos showed a numerical or structural rearrangement. Fortranslocation carriers, pregnancy rate per transfer was 58% and live birth rate per transfer 44%. For PGT-A patients, pregnancy rate and live birth rate were 39% and 25%respectively. M. Baetens: None. I. De Croo: None. A. Dheedene: None. K. Tilleman: None. B. Menten: None. P01.090.C Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) for cancer predisposition: A single center large cohort experience S. Zuckerman 1, O. Freireich1, T. Eldar-Geva2,S . Center, Jerusalem, Israel,2IVF unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel In the last decade an increasing number of people carriers of cancer predisposition mutations (CCPM) are performing PGT-M. PGT-M for these late-onset and partial penetrant conditions implies that the procedure selects againstembryos that might have been cancer-free. Moreover, pre- ventive and therapeutic options for decreasing morbidity and mortality are available and ongoing cancer researchmight reveal treatments altering the natural history of cancer in the future. Most studies exploring perceptions of PGT-M among CCPM, were based on participants 'theoretical declarative intentions. Actual use has rarely been reported and analyzed. Between 2006-2019 overall 173 CCPM wereAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 167counseled in our center: One couple between 2006-2008 and gradual increase until 102 CCPM between 2018-2019.

P01.091.A Obstetric risks associated with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders and structural chromo-somal rearrangements (PGT-M/SR) compared to regular . M. Heijligers Y. Arens1, R. van Golde1, M. van der Hoeven1, J. Dumoulin1, I. Homminga2, Tilborg3,C . de Montfoort1 Medical Center Gro- ningen, Netherlands,3University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands Introduction: Earlier studies on the obstetric outcome in pregnancies following PGT are inconclusive since both an increased risk and no increased risk for adverse obstetricoutcome are reported. Moreover, not all of these studies distinguish between PGT for monogenic disorders aneuploidies (PGT-A). Methods: This pregnancies PGT-M/SR ( n=389) and IVF/ ICSI treatments ( n=1667) conducted between 2004 and 2014. Data were collected from the medical les and fromquestionnaires. These data included parental characteristics, characteristics of the treatment preceding the pregnancy and obstetric and neonatal characteristics. Results: Obstetric complications were reported in 18% and 19% of the singleton pregnancies in the PGT and regular IVF/ICSI group, respectively ( P=0.103). The risk for stillbirth was lower in the PGT group ( P=0.044). Birth weights of all singletons were converted into z-scores and showed a comparable birth weight for the two groups (0.09vs. -0.02; P=0.084). Within the multiple pregnancies, the risk for obstetric complications ( P=0.535) and the incidence of fetal loss ( P=0.617) was comparable between the PGT and IVF/ICSI group. The mean pregnancy duration was longer ( P=0.037) and the mean birth weight was higher ( P=0.010) in the PGT group. More monozygotic pregnancies were observed in the PGT group ( P=0.009). Conclusions: The more invasive nature of the PGT-M/ SR technique does not lead to an increased risk for obstetriccomplications as compared to a regular IVF/ICSI treatment. M. Heijligers: None. Y.

P01.092.B Results gained from fetal exome sequencing inform clinical management. A report of 100 cases . E. Dempsey 1, L. Ive2, R. Dubis2, T. Homfray1, S. Drury2 1St George 's University of London, London, United King- dom,2Congenica Ltd, Cambridge, United Kingdom Introduction: Exome sequencing in cases of fetal structural malformation has been shown to increase diagnostic yield(over traditional diagnostic methods) by 8-80%, depending on phenotype. This technique is soon to be made available throughout England as part of a centralisation and stan-dardisation of genetic laboratory services. Materials and Methods: We have undertaken exome sequencing in 100 cases of fetal anomaly as part of a serviceimprovement project at St George 's Hospital. In half of cases sequencing was undertaken with the intention of informing the management of an ongoing pregnancy. In theremaining cases exome sequencing was undertaken post- mortem. Exome data was analysed via the application of patient-speci c phenotype panels, reducing the risk of incidental ndings. Results: Our diagnostic rate across all cases is ~ 40 % and higher in cases with skeletal and oedema phenotypes.Exome results have in fluenced the management of preg- nancy and labour. They have also directed early neonatal168 J. del Picchiacare, including enabling the treatment of a newborn with enzyme replacement therapy. The results of exome sequen- cing have been used for accurate assessment of recurrence risk. In addition, results can be used for prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis in a future pregnancy. Conclusions: Using speci c case examples we will describe the way in which the results of fetal exome sequencing have in fluenced clinical management. We will also describe the challenges we have encountered in theimplementation of a fetal exome sequencing service, including the analysis of variants of uncertain signi cance in phenotype-limited situations.

However, interpretation of WES data is complicated due to variousfactors including limited knowledge on the prenatal fetal phenotype of rare monogenic disorders. We therefore aimed to describe the prenatal fetal phenotype of genetic variantsfound by WES. Methods: In this single-center study, we included fetuses in whom WES was indicated in a prenatal diagnostic settingbetween March 1, 2018 and January 1, 2020 during pregnancy or after termination of pregnancy. We performed trio WES using a phenotype-dependent ltering strategy. We documented prenatal and postnatal characteristics of fetuses and compared the phenotype with literature using PubMed. Results: WES was performed in 93 fetuses. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found in 29 (31.2%) fetuses (21 different genes). For eight genes, it was the rst time a causative genetic variant was found in a prenatal setting ( C2CD3,CNOT1,GATA6, PLD1,POMK,SAMD9, SMC3,THOC6 ). In three fetuses, some detected structural anomalies have not previously been described ( PEX1-, POMK-,THOC6- variants). In three fetuses, diagnosis wasltered out in the prenatal setting due to various reasons, but could be established using additional postnatal phenotypic characteristics. In general, the prenatal phenotype on ultrasound corresponded well with postnatal phenotype although some features were not detected by the prenatal ultrasound examination. Conclusions: Increased knowledge about the prenatal fetal phenotype is important for improving the interpretation and classi cation of fetal genetic variants. This will lead to improvement of parental genetic counseling as well as prenatal and neonatal care. L. Leeuwen: None. K. Bouman: None. N. Corsten- Janssen: None.

Groningen, Groningen, Nether- lands,2Department of Gynecology and Prenatal Diagnosis, University Medical Centre Groningen, Gronin- gen, Netherlands,3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecol- ogy, Isala, Zwolle, Zwolle, Netherlands Background: Adding rES to conventional genetic tests for fetuses with ultrasound abnormalities improves the diag-nostic yield, but differs from performing postnatal rES for instance by its rapid turnaround time and the impact of a diagnosis. We will present the lessons we learned by per-forming rES as a diagnostic test in prenatal care from March 2018. Methods: We performed trio rES analysis using a custom virtual gene panel of ~4,300 OMIM genes during pregnancy. Inclusion criteria were: 1) two or more independent major fetal anomalies, or 2) hydrops fetalisor bilateral polycystic kidneys, or 3) one major fetal anomaly and a rst-degree relative with the same anomaly. Results : We established a genetic rES-based diagnosis in 14 out of 54 (26%) eligible fetuses with a mean turnaround time of 14 days. We learned the following lessons: (1) We made unexpected diagnoses using our broad virtual panel,like Zellweger syndrome in a fetus suspected of a ciliopathy. (2) We missed four diagnoses that were made postnatally using additional phenotypic information andadapted our lter strategy. 3) We were confronted with incidental unsolicited ndings and changed our lterAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 169strategy to minimize them. (4) There is a lack of knowledge about prenatal phenotype of known genetic conditions, which hinders diagnostics. Further, we experienced the impact of time pressure to generate a diagnosis in limited time and had to deal with changing fetal phenotypes. Conclusion : rES in the prenatal setting is feasible but challenging, and improves by adapting the process based on insights from previous experiences. N. Corsten-Janssen: None. K. Bouman: None. A.J.

Sedlackova 1, of Scienti c and Technical Information, Bratislava, Slovakia,5Comenius University Science Park, Bratislava, Slovakia,6Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Comenius University,Bratislava, Slovakia, 7Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: Fetal sex determination is already a common part of the standard non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). The current classi cation methods are almost entirely accurate for fetal sex prediction in singleton pregnancies, but they still show the limitations for multiple pregnancies, with 98% reported accuracy of fetal sex prediction in twins. Methods: We enrolled 99 maternal samples with twin pregnancies and con rmed fetus sex in this study. Since a precise estimation of the fetal fraction is a key for correctsex determination, we used a previously published improved predictor utilizing two different attributes of analyzed genomic material - length and genomic location ofthe sequenced DNA fragments. Subsequent fetal sex prediction was performed using an SVM classi er. Results: Our method has shown perfect prediction accuracy in distinguishing between pregnancies with two female fetuses and pregnancies with at least one male fetus. We observed one incorrect prediction between one and twomale fetuses. Overall, the accuracy of fetal sex prediction was 98.99%.Conclusions: Here we described a novel bioinformatic algorithm to determine the sex of both fetuses in twin pregnancies, by the analysis of cell-free fetal DNA from the maternal plasma. Our algorithm achieved superior accuracy in fetal sex prediction in twins compared to known bioinformatics tools. Moreover, it provides supportinggraphs for visual inspection and calculation of prediction condence.

P01.100.A The value of prenatal array to detect submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances in cases with abnormal fetal ultrasonographic ndings; a retrospective study L. OZER , M. Aydin, S. Aktuna, E. Unsal MIKROGEN GENETIC DIAGNOSIS CENTER, ANKARA, Turkey Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is used in prenatal diag- nosis for detecting CNVs which are too small to detect by karyotyping. Here we report our laboratory 's array data of prenatal samples and describe phenotype-genotype corre-lations. Methods: 180 specimens (149 amniotic fluid, 23 chorionic villi and 8 cord blood samples) were analyzed by array CGH. Detection of genomic CNVs was performedusing Agilent, guidelines. Results: %16.1 of patients (29/180), CNVs were detected. 24 of them hadsegmental duplication or deletion, 5 had trisomy and 1 had monosomy X. 3.3% of patients had aneuploidy, 4.4% of patients and segmental deletions/duplications. 61.1% of the segmental pathogenic variants were deletions and most of the VUS variants were duplications (62.5%). 50% of thesegmental pathogenic variants were < 7 Mb and the smallest size was 0.5MB (deletion). 22.2% of pathogenic variants were well-de ned CNV syndromes. The most prevalent indications were ultrasonographic anomalies, increased triple test risk and advanced maternal age. While 30% of patients with normal results have normal ultrasound,all patients with a pathogenic variant had an ultrasound anomaly. The most de ned ultrasonographic ndings in cases with pathogenic variants were cardiac anomalies,increased NT and brain anomalies. Conclusion: Detection of submicroscopic imbalances by CMA increases the power170 J. del Picchiaof prenatal diagnosis. Our data emphasize the importance of CMA in the prenatal diagnosis of the fetuses with abnormal ultrasonographic ndings whereas conventional karyotyp- ing resolution is inadequate to detect submicroscopic changes.

We aimed to evaluate the value of targeted whole exome sequencing (WES) in fetuses with prenatal sonographic abnormalities and normalmicroarray and karyotype. Materials and Methods: After informed consent was obtained, we sequenced the DNA from amniotic fluid cells of 17 fetuses by WES (Illumina NextSEQ500). We then performed bioinformatic analysis of a selected gene panel. All cases were ongoing pregnancies. The genomic resultswere obtained within 2 weeks. Results: The 17 fetuses presented with the following anomalies: isolated malformations ( n=6), identi ed in 4 cases (24%): two with sustained increased nuchal translucency presented with a de novo variant in RAF1 (p. Ser267Arg) and in BRAF (p.Thr241Arg) genes, compatible with a RASopathy, the fetus with skeletal dysplasia had a de novo variant in COL11A1 gene (p.Gln921_Pro926del) causing Stickler/Marshall syndrome and the fetus with fetalis recessive Pregnancy was terminated in all 4 cases. Conclusions: targeted WES is an adequate approach of genome-wide sequencing for ongoing pregnancies with fetal structural abnormalities suspicious for a genetic etiology and normal microarray. It has a diagnostic utilityand might facilitates genetic counseling. L. Quteineh: None. J. Pellegrinelli: None. M. Billieux: None. M. Guipponi: None. S. Laurent: None. E. Hammar: None. A.

P01.104.B Ogilvie2 1Viapath analytics, London, United Kingdom,2Genetics Department, Guys and St. Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Placental mosaicism for compli- cates prenatal analysis of chorionic villus (CV) samples and has a reported incidence of up to 2%. Quantitative fluorescence-PCR (QF-PCR) analysis of microsatellite repeats is widely used to establish chromosome copy number of uncultured CV samples; if recommended pre- paration methods are employed, both cytotrophoblast andmesoderm should be represented. In the case of trisomy results, the presence of three different alleles is observed in ~90% of cases, con rming meiotic non-disjunction as the origin of the abnormal cell line. Where only biallelic 2:1 ratios are observed, the trisomy may have arisen by mitotic non-disjunction following a normal conception, in whichcase a normal cell line may be present; European and UK best practice guidelines recommend that non-mosaic bial- lelic (NMB) results should be reported more cautiously,given the increased risk of mosaicism. However, the like- lihood of nding a normal cell line following an NMB result is not established. We have therefore audited 10 yearsof cases and compared NMB results to the follow-up kar- yotype and/or amniocentesis results. In total, 133 CVS showed NMB results for common trisomies, of which 131were concordant with follow-up tests. Two trisomy 18 cases showed a normal result on amniocentesis, indicating con- ned placental mosaicism; neither case had ultrasound abnormalities present at referral. Therefore, in this cohort, ~1.5% of NMB QF-PCR cases subsequently showedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 171evidence of mosaicism, this is reduced to 0% for cases with USS abnormalities.

P01.105.C Parental experiences of rapid Exome Sequencing in case of serious ultrasound abnormalities during pregnancy M. Plantinga1, L. Zwienenberg1, E. van Dijk1, H. Netherlands : Adding rapid Exome Sequencing (rES) to con- ventional genetic tests (QF-PCR and SNP-array) canimprove the diagnostic yield of pregnancies showing ultrasound abnormalities but also includes a higher chance of unsolicited ndings. rES was offered in the context of a prenatal rES implementation study with a turnaround time of 14 days. We evaluated how this offer was experienced in an explorative mixed-methods parental experience study. Methods: We investigated reasons for accepting and declining rES, the impact of rES on decision making, experiences of the counseling and test process, andunderstanding of test information and possible test out- comes. All couples were asked to ll two surveys, one after pre-test and one after post-test counseling. Part of thecouples were approached for an interview until data saturation was reached. Results: 44 couples participated in the survey study, 11 in the interview study. In 22% of pregnancies, a diagnosis was found, in 31% an unsolicited nding. 95% wanted to be informed about unsolicited ndings. The most important reason for accepting rES was to nd a diagnosis. Most parents already decided to terminate the pregnancy on the basis of the ultrasound abnormalities, although rES resultsimpacted decision in a few cases. The impact for future pregnancies was higher than with conventional testing and the fast turnaround was valued highly. The counseling andtest process was experienced positive. Parents suggested to add information of other parents 'experiences and decisio- nal process to the test information. Conclusion : Parents evaluate rES positively, despite the risk of unsolicited ndings. M. Plantinga: None. L. Zwienenberg: None. E. van Dijk: None. H. Breet: None. J. Diphoorn: None.

Kalantari1,2,3, I. Filges1,2,3 1Medical Genetics, Institute of Medical Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland, 2Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland,3University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland Introduction: Uni- or bilateral renal agenesis (RA) is a commonly occurring major congenital anomaly impacting fetal and neonatal outcomes. Although chromosomal abnormalities, CNVs and pathogenic variants in manygenes have been associated to RA, the etiology is still poorly understood. Our aim was to better understand the biological pathways involved in RA and to identify inter-acting candidate pathways useful for further geneidenti cation and molecular diagnosis in clinical care when applying genome-wide sequencing. Materials and Methods: We used Phenolyzer to obtain all genes known as causative for syndromic and non- syndromic uni- and bilateral RA. Using ClueGO gene enrichment analysis we classi ed the relationship between these genes and biological processes as de ned by gene ontology. Results: We identi ed 289 genes described to be involved in the pathogenesis of RA when mutated. We obtained 69 groups of enriched biological processes. About 50% included pathways directly related to the developmentof urogenital organ tissues endocrine pathways are enriched,which may relate to different clinical presentations of RA. The results also support the hypothesis that RA is part of the ciliopathy spectrum and developmentally related to dys-plastic kidneys. Conclusions: Our gene ontology analysis shows that genes representing distinct biological pathways are sig-nicantly enriched. They may relate to different clinical presentations of RA, which will lead to an improved delineation of candidate genes and molecular diagnosis ofthis congenital anomaly in clinical practice. S.

J. 1, Paris, France Mitochondria play a critical role during the early stages of human embryo development by supplying suf cient levels of energy required for embryo survival. Because mtDNA replication is silenced during early embryonic development,the presence of a large number of mtDNA copies in the mature oocyte is mandatory. In human, several studies on blastocysts day-5 embryos have paradoxically evidenced apositive correlation between high quantities of mtDNA molecules and severe conditions, like aneuploidy, poor embryo quality, and implantation failure. However, datafrom day-3 embryos are much more limited and contra- dictory, making this point a highly controversial one.174 J. del PicchiaWe have quanti ed the mtDNA copy number (CN) in residual DNA of 1 or 2 cells, sampled from day-3 embryos, in a context of preimplantation genetic analysis for a non- metabolic, non-mitochondrial DNA disorder ( n=165, mutation ( the mtDNA CN wasfound, among the different cells of a given embryo, and the different embryos from a given patient. A maternal effect regulating the mtDNA CN was observed, but remained ofunknown origin. In particular, no correlation was detected between mtDNA CN and maternal age or ovarian reserve. mtDNA CN did not correlate with embryonic quality andability of an embryo to implant and give a viable pregnancy. Finally, the mtDNA CN was not in fluenced by the presence of a mtDNA mutation. Based on these ndings, mtDNA CN at day 3 of development cannot be used to select the best embryo to transfer. J.

P01.109.A A FAST AND NON-INVASIVE METHOD TO DETERMINE FETAL RHD GENE STATUS B. Schreiner , Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is a serious complication of maternal and fetal blood group incompatibility. This occurs when a Rhesus-Dnegative woman, carrying a Rhesus-D positive fetus during herrst pregnancy, is alloimmunized against RhD antigen and carries another Rhesus-positive fetus during a sub-sequent pregnancy. Nowadays, HDFN is rare since anti-D prophylaxis is provided to all RhD negative pregnant women. However, 40% of these women carry a Rhesus-negative fetus and are administered unnecessary treatment including all risks connected to blood-based products. Aims: We set out to develop a fast and reliable diagnostic test assessing the fetal RHD gene status from maternal blood at the end of the rst pregnancy trimester to enable targeted anti-D prophylaxis. Methods: A real-time PCR-based assay was developed to cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal blood. The assay contains primer-probe combination speci c for the RHD gene and the GAPDH house-keeping gene as internal control. CffDNA from clinical samples was automatically extracted from 1mL of plasma. Results: Devyser RHD exhibits high experiment repeat- ability between different reagent lots. The analyticalsensitivity is down to DNA concentrations corresponding to less than 7 gene copies per reaction with 95% probability. Summary/conclusions: Devyser RHD provides a fast, non-invasive procedure to assess the fetal RHD status in Rhesus-D negative mothers. This product is validated together with an automated DNA extraction process andreaction set-up (QIASymphony AS/SP), enabling high- throughput sample analysis with low-risk for sample mix- up. Various kit sizes are available offering flexibility with sample throughput. B. Schreiner: A. Employment (full or part-time); Signi cant; of whole genome sequencing Q. Zhou , J. Sun, T. Wang, Y. Xing, Z. Wan, X. Yang, Z. Liu, W. Wang Genomics Institute of Beijing, Shenzhen, China Introduction: Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS) is a rare disorder and has been described in all ethnicities, with several identi ed pathogenic variants. Since there is fewer than hundreds of individuals have been described, thepopulation prevalence is unknown. The genetic features and follow-up data of individuals with RTS are limited. Methods: We performed a whole genome sequencing (WGS) using cord blood for an infant, who had RTS like clinical features in infancy. Results: The infant showed a developmental delay in infancy, with a small size in both height and weight. The erythema started appearing on her face at the age of three months and then spread to the entire body. Besides, she hadneither eyelashes nor eyebrows, with sparse scalp hair. After analyzing the WGS data, we found a heterozygous nonsense mutation c.2752G>T (p.Glu918*) a novelframeshift-insertion c.1547_1548insC (p.Ala516fs) in the gene RECQL4 , which is a known pathogenic gene of RTS. Both variants had potential effects on protein synthesis orfunction. Further validation indicated these were compound variants inheriting from parents. Conclusions: Taking together with the clinical istics and the identi cation of biallelic pathogenic variants in a recessive manner, we report a diagnosed infant with RTS. Our ndings provide potential application of WGS for newborn to clinical diagnosis. The follow-up study can helpAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 175to further understand the clinical features and the genotype- phenotype interactions of RTS.

P01.111.C Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome familial case series with an emphasis on Vilnius, Lithuania,2Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine,Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania, 3Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, syndrome (SGBS) is a rare recessively inherited X-linked condition, with less than 300 reported cases. Characteristic features of SGBSinclude pre/postnatal overgrowth, distinctive craniofacial features (macrocephaly, coarse face visceromegaly and increased risk of neoplasia. This condi-tion is almost always diagnosed postnatally. Materials and methods: A 23-y/o woman with unin- formative anamnesis on the 21 weeks 'gestation was referred due to abnormal fetal ultrasound ndings (poly- fetal DNA qPCR and SNP-CGH tests from amniotic fluid revealed no chromosomal abnormalities. The precise evaluation of mother 's phenotype (tall stature, coarse facial features, macroglossia) and fetal scan were key to directly sequence GPC3 gene and make the correct SGBS diagnosis prenatally. Results: Sanger sequencing 4 of the GPC3 gene, which determines SGBS. Mother was also found to be a carrier. Despite severe polyhydramnios progression on 33 weeks 'gestation, condition of the fetus was manageable and, pregnancy was carried to 38th weeks. The newborn 's phenotype presented with classical SGBS features. Conclusions: An accurate evaluation of maternal pheno- type and fetal scan are essential pathognomonic signs for early suspicion of SGBS.

Nowadays, for these purposes embryo material isneeded. The removal of three cells in a day 5 embryo, represents an invasive procedure that could concern the embryo viability and increase the cost of a PGT. In the pastfew years there have been an increasing interest in the possibility of obtaining reliable DNA in the spent culture media (SCM) where the embryo is growing (1, 2). Materials and Methods: For optimal PGT-M results, we aim to compare embryo biopsy and SCM. After that, we want to go further: discern whether the SCM is even a betterchoice to diagnose an embryo in comparison with the trophectoderm biopsy, comparing a complete embryo. All based on next generation sequencing (NGS) withPGDSeq TM(Journey Genomics S.L.U.) technology. Results: We can con rm a high coincidence of SCM with complete embryo and the embryo biopsy. Tis primaryresults are promising, even if there are less polymorphisms obtained from this kind of material, we were able to study the haplotypes and the inheritance of the embryos. Conclusions: A non-invasive perspective on the PGT world is certainly to be the next generation of samples.Bibliography:1. Huang, L. et al.

Kogan2 1St. Petersburg State University, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation,2The Research Institute of Obstetrics, Gynecol- ogy and Reproductology named after D.O.Ott, Saint- Petersburg, Russian Federation Introduction: Sperm contain a complex population of RNA, and the utility of sperm RNA in fertility research arecurrently being explored. During mammalian spermato- genesis, the chromatin structure undergoes substantial condensation. The key role in this process is played byprotamines 1 and 2 (PRM1, PRM2). Abnormal condensa- tion could lead to DNA breaks, which is linked to preg- nancy loss after assisted fertilization, disturbances inembryo development and increased risk of abortions. The aim of this study was to estimate the relations between protamine mRNA ration and semen quality and furtherDNA fragmentation. Finding sperm-quality markers would help to understand the causes of male infertility and to improve the male reproductive health. Materials and Methods: Human ejaculates were obtained from 33 patients and semen analyses were assessed by WHO criteria (2010). We evaluated the spermDNA fragmentation measured by TUNEL assay. Patient 's ejaculates were ed by sperm cells were mRNA reverse tran-scribed and subjected to real-time qPCR speci c primer for protamine-1 p<0,05).

P01.116.B Investigating PHF13 induced infertility through single cell transcriptomics and non-vertebrate model organisms E. Bosch1, S. Ekici1,C Genetics, FAU Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany,2Digital Health Center, Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) and Charit\u00e9, Berlin, Germany Infertility is a common medical problem worldwide. Of all infertility cases, approximately 40 - 50% are due to \"male factor \"infertility, mostly caused by spermatogenic failure. Despite extensive research, there is still limited knowledgeof the genetic causes and underlying molecular mechan- isms. We previously showed that de ciency for the epige- netic reader PHF13 in the mouse results in testis hypoplasiadue to a spermatogenic defect. Here, we obtained single-cell RNA expression pro les from Phf13 /andPhf13+/-testis and compared them with wild type data. The results revealed a loss of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) in pachytene spermato- cytes of de cient mice. This is remarkable, since canonical PHF13 is only expressed in spermatogonia. In combination with ChIPseq data demonstrating an enrich- ment of PHF13 binding sites on the X- and Y-chromosome,we hypothesize that PHF13 mediates epigenetic changes on the sex chromosomes in spermatogonia, rendering the chromosomes competent for later inactivation. PHF13 is evolutionarily conserved down to Bilateria including sea urchin, acorn worm and several insects like theflour beetle ( Tribolium ), but strikingly not inD. melanogaster and compared these lines with wild type lines and lines overexpressing neuronal control genes. Phf13 -overexpressing strains but not the control strains show a high grade of infertility in seemingly normal flies. This strongly indicates a conserved and very speci c function of this protein in germ cell development, makingPHF13 an interesting infertility factor and a fundamental player in germ cell differentiation.

Its correct regulation during pregnancy iscrucial for embryonic development. The possible contribu- tion of TL to the developmental capacity of embryos with abnormal karyotype remains unknown so far. Here, westudied TL in karyotypically normal and abnormal chorion in progressing pregnancies and embryonic losses. The chorionic villus samples were obtained by chorion biopsyfrom 15 patients with progressing rst trimester pregnancy referred to invasive prenatal diagnosis and by curettage from 15 patients with missed abortion. The karyotypicallyabnormal samples included trisomy 21 and trisomy 16 cases in both progressing pregnancies n=7) and missed abor- tion ( n=7). The detected on direct metaphase preparations by qFISH. Relative TLs were measured by dividing telomeric by subtelomeric fluores- cence intensity assessed in ImageJ1.49v. The results werecompared by the Mann-Whitney U-test. In progressing pregnancies, the relative TL was higher in karyotypically abnormal samples compared to karyotypically normal ones(p < 0.0001). In missed abortions, we observed the same tendency although the difference did not reach statistical signicance (p =0.4652). When comparing the relative TL between the samples with normal karyotype in progressing pregnancies and missed abortions, we revealed no differ- ence (p =0.8890). However, the relative TL was higher in the samples with abnormal karyotype in progressing preg- nancies compared to those in missed abortions (p =0.0013). Our results suggest that in the case of karyotype abnorm-ality, longer telomeres in chorionic villi may contribute to success. Supported RSF del V.S. Baranov: None.

Ott Research Institute of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductology, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation,2Saint Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation Telomeres are complex structures of tandem DNA repeats and proteins at chromosome ends. Telomere shortening dueto cell divisions, oxidative stress or genetic effects may result in end-to-end chromosome joining, their degradation, and cell death. In contrast to short telomeres in oocytes,sperm telomeres become longer with age. Telomere length (TL) correlates with embryo developmental potential advocating the importance of TL analysis after fertilization.The study was performed on metaphase chromosomes of 23 triploid human zygotes from 20 couples (women aged 32.04 \u00b1 0.8; men aged 34.15 \u00b1 1.2) referred vitrofertilization. Paternal (sperm-derived) chromosomes were identi ed immunocytochemically by weak DNA methyla- tion and strong hydroxymethylation which contrasted themwith strongly methylated poorly hydroxymethylated maternal (oocyte-derived) chromosomes. After qFISH, relative TL was measured by dividing was signi cantly higher in the paternal compared to the maternal chromosomes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, < 0.0001). Rare zygotes demonstrated the opposite pattern: higher TL in the maternal chromosomes. However, they seem to be the exception rather than the rule suggesting thatsome cases of developmental arrest may be caused by altered TL pattern. Neither in sperm- nor in oocyte-derived chromosomes the relative TL correlated with paternal (r =- 0.058; =0.736) or maternal age (r =0.155; =0.44), respectively. after fertilization, TL in paternal chro- mosomes is \"reprogrammed \". Being hypomethylated, paternal chromosomes are prone to recombination and, thus, to alternative lengthening of telomeres, which may be part of developmental program and explains the absence ofcorrelation of TL in sperm-derived chromosomes with paternal age. Stepanov1 1Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy ofSciences, Tomsk, Russian Federation, 2Siberian State Medical University, Tomsk, Russian Federation The great obstetrical syndromes (GOS) are common preg- nancy complications that can have detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality of the mother and fetus as well aslong-term health outcomes. Although they are distinct conditions, they are often considered together as they share a common etiology of inadequate placental perfusion. Theaim of the work was to search for new genetic markers of GOS on the basis of integrative analysis of transcriptomic data. Genome-wide expression pro ling was performed on placental tissue from preeclamptic and normal ( n=47) pregnancies. Thirty original datasets from patients with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia(n=434) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and were further integrated and analyzed with our data. Subsequently, 5023 differentially expressed genes(DEGs) between GOS patients and healthy women were identi ed. We found that the transcriptional activity of 64 DEGs changes in at least two GOS diseases. Weighted geneco-expression network analysis identi ed distinct gene modules associated with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction or preeclampsia. Using Gene Set EnrichmentAnalysis we identi ed the signi cant role of disturbance of intercellular interactions and regulation of proteins mod- ication in placental tissue during the development of the GOS. We applied upstream analysis approach implemented in geneXplain platform and identi ed STAT3 and UBE2R2 ) that are new therapeutic targets. These key genes may be potential biomarkers of diagnosis, therapy and prognosis for GOS.

Rodriguez-Solera1, M. Martinez-Garcia1, I. Diez1,I Spain,8Hospital Santiago de Compostela, Spain Background : Exome sequencing has proved to be a useful diagnostic tool when fetal structural anomalies suggest a genetic etiology, but other standard prenatal genetic testsdid not provide a diagnosis. We describe a single laboratory experience with prenatal and fetal samples. Material and Methods : This study includes 13 samples with ultrasound images suggesting skeletal abnormalities or rasopathies, among others. The samples origin were amniotic fluid (69%) and fetal tissues (31%). In six cases a whole exome sequencing with a trio analysis was performed. The genomic libraries were generated using SureSelectXT and sequenced on a Novaseq 6000. Dataalignment, calling and ltering was performed using an in- house developed pipeline. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Results : A molecular diagnosis was obtained on 1 amniotic fluid prenatal sample and on 1 fetal specimen (15% global diagnostic yield). All positive cases wereobtained after trio analysis. Two pathogenic variants in the ESCO2 gene associated with Roberts syndrome were identi ed in the prenatal sample and one homozygous variant in the ASPM gene, associated with a primary microcephaly 5, was identi ed in fetal tissue. Both variants were cosegregated with the disease. Ultrasound studies didnot suggest the candidate genes due to the insuf cient and nonspeci c information about the prenatal clinical presenta- tion of these syndromes. Conclusion : This study highlights the importance of trio WES integration into prenatal diagnosis. Compared to ultrasound studies alone, prenatal molecular diagnoses ledto a re ned recurrence risk estimation, altered medical management and allows an informed reproductive planning for families. C.

Schaefer, (UPA) is a selective pro- gesterone receptor modulator used for emergency contra- ception (EC) after unprotected sexual intercourse. Data on pregnancy outcome after failure of EC is very limited. Material and Methods: Observational study of prospec- tively ascertained pregnancies after UPA exposure for EC. In addition, retrospectively reported pregnancy outcomeswere evaluated separately. Results: Among 216 requests to the German Embryotox institute related to EC with UPA, 95 concerned prospec-tively ascertained pregnancies after failed EC. Follow-up data on pregnancy outcome was obtained in 56 pregnancies: 7 spontaneous abortions, 12 terminations of pregnancy(ETOP) and 37 live births. Major birth defects were not reported. Only 34% of women had taken UPA during the fertile window. Among the 4 retrospectively reportedpregnancies there was one child diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann-syndrome (BWS) due to hypo- methylation of IC2. Conclusions: We provide a preliminary basis for reassuring women who wish to carry their pregnancy to term after failed EC with UPA. However, due to theretrospective case report of a child with BWS after maternal UPA exposure possible epigenetic effects could not be excluded and require further evaluation. As ovarianstimulation alone (independent of arti cial reproductive techniques) was previously discussed as a predisposing factor for disturbance of imprinting maintenance, UPAmight have in fluenced preimplantation development and disturbed epigenetic processes.

Venkatesh, Manipal Hospital, Bangalore, India Introduction: WAGR syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with prevalence of 1 in 500,000 to 1 million. It affects many body systems and is named for its main features: wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies and range ofdevelopmental delays. Children with WAGR syndrome present with aniridia, genito-urinary defects in the new born period and are at an increased risk for developing malig-nancies, varying range of intellectual disability and obesity in childhood. The syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving chromosome 11p13 containing WT1 andPAX6 genes. Materials and Methods: We report a case of 29-year-old Asian (Indian ethnicity) primigravida with non-consanguineous marriage. Her mid trimester anomaly scan at 18 weeks gestation showed bilateral ventriculomegaly, septum pellucidum performed using an Agilent 8x60K array. The cytogenomic microarrayanalysis showed 4.9MB deletion in chromosome 11 (11p13-p12). Discussion: The prenatal diagnosis of WAGR syndrome is associated with borderline ventriculomegaly, absent corpus callosum and absent cavum septum pellucidum. In order to diagnose rare syndrome, microarray should be therst choice of investigation in the presence of any structural abnormality. This would help in understanding the prenatal presentation, potential co-morbid condition, counseling andaccordingly decision making. Conclusions: The clinical association of WAGR syn- drome in postnatal period is well established but theantenatal presentation is not well-understood and reported twice in the literature earlier. Microarray study con rms these rare non-classical prenatal manifestations of WAGRsyndrome. M. Shetty: None. P. Venkatesh: None. S. Menezes: None. S. Hegde: None.

Chromo- somal aneuploidy and structural abnormalities are explored by karyotype testing and chromosomal microarray (CGH).The utility of prenatal whole exome sequencing (WES) is discussed. Information on the interest of prenatal WES remains limited. Methods and results: In our cohort of 53 fetuses with normal karyotype and CGH, Trio WES was performed. All fetuses had ultrasound abnormalities of poor prognosis.Most fetuses (26) were analyzed after medical termination of pregnancy, 24 analyzes were performed on ongoing pregnancies and 3 analyzes after intrauterine fetal demise.Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in 20 cases resulting in a diagnostic yield of 37%. Of these, 55% (11) were autosomal dominant with de novo variants, 45%of the diagnoses autosomal variants). In urgent cases turn-around-timewas 2 weeks. Reporting results for an antenatal Trio WES varies between 2-4 weeks. Conclusions: Whole exome sequencing identi ed a genetic cause for the fetal anomalies in 20 of the 53 (37%) cases analyzed. This made it possible to carry out genetic counseling for families and to offer targeted prenataldiagnosis for recessive diseases in case of a new pregnancy. D. Trost: None. A. Boughalem: None. P.

Skoblov Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Congenital aniridia (AN) is a rare autosomal dominant panocular disorder caused by mutations in the PAX6 gene. Previously, we performed a molecular genetic study of a large cohort of Russian patients with AN and found six PAX6 nucleotide variants in 5 -UTR. It is known that 5 -UTR variants could in fluence the translation ef - ciency and cause some diseases, but for AN such a mechanism has not been previously shown. Thus, to investigate the pathogenicity of 5 -UTR PAX6 variants the functional studies are required. Materials and Methods: To study 5 -UTR variants we by luciferase dual-assay, mRNA structure and expression level were determined by RT-PCR and qPCR respectively. Results: Six patient-derived 5 -UTR-variants were found to lead to a signi cant decrease in the translation ef ciency, while mRNA expression level was not signi cantly reduced. Three of these variants also aff ect splicing. Further bioinfor- matics analysis allows us to suggest the mechanism of 5 -UTR variants pathogenicity throug h disruption of an upstream ORF which possibly exists in PAX6 5-UTR. To validate this hypothesis, we performed additi onal mutagenesis experiments and con rmed the essential role of uORF in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. M oreover, we showed that this uORF normally affects the main protein translation. Conclusions: We have identi ed uORF in 5 -UTR of the PAX6 gene and found that mutations that disrupt this uORF cause the congenital aniridia. In addition, we hypothesized that this uORF may participate in the normal regulation ofPAX6 expression. A. Filatova: None. T. Vasilyeva: None. A. Marakho- nov: None. R. Zinchenko: None. M.

Major challenges in STGD1 molecular diagnostics include (i) non-coding variants typically not targeted by available genetic tests (ii) copy number variants (CNV) missed by standard testing, and (iii) hypomorphic variants. variants and their contribution to STGD1 diagnostic yield in a cohort ofinherited retinal disease (IRD) patients. Materials and Methods: We included 7500 IRD patients tested at a CLIA laboratory between 2017 and 2019.Sequencing analysis, including established non-coding ABCA4 variants and high resolution CNV detection, was done by using in-house developed and validated NGSplatform. Results: Two disease-causing ABCA4 variants of which 20 (20/663; 3%) had an established non-coding variant and 11 (11/663; 1.5%) a CNV. In 192 patients with clinically diagnosed ABCA4 - related disease, only one disease-causing variant wasidenti ed. those, the hypomorphic allele signi cantly increased median age at genetictesting among the 109 patients was 56 years, which was signicantly higher compared to 37 years among the 663 patients with two disease-causing variants.

P02.03.B A novel splicing variant con rms COL11A1 as a cause of autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss in the DFNA37 \u2014Head & Neck Surgery, hearing loss (HL) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Many genes exhi- biting either non-syndromic or syndromic HL have also been identi ed as causing both, owing to extensive phe- notypic manifestations in the form of pleiotropy. The gene COL11A1 has long been associated with autosomal domi- nant Marshall syndrome and Stickler syndrome type II, aswell as autosomal recessive brochondrogenesis. Each of these syndromes have phenotypes abnormalities, dysmorphic features, variable ocular and auditory phenotypes that mild-to-moderate HL, and outer ear malformations. Recently, COL11A1 has been associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic HL (DFNA37) through the genetic analysis of a large European-American family pre- senting a novel splice-site altering variant. Materials and Methods: A proband from a four generation family with non-syndromic HL was ascertained. DNA from the proband was subjected to a custom-designedhigh-throughput sequencing panel consisting of 160 HL- associated genes. An in vitro splice assay was performed to study the RNA-level effect of the variant. Results: The patient was diagnosed with moderate sensorineural HL. Additional syndromic features were absent. A +2T>C, p.?, NM_080629.2) was uncovered in COL11A1 that is predicted to abolish the 5 splice site in exon 58 out of the 68 exons comprising COL11A1 . Furthermore, this novel variant affects a highly conserved nucleotide in the alphachain domain. In vitro splice testing con rmed abnormal splicing. Conclusions: We report on the second DFNA37- associated splice-altering variant, providing con rmatory evidence of COL11A1 as a bona deautosomal dominant non-syndromic HL gene. B. Vona: None. A.

Materials and methods: A total of 61 families (78 affected cases) with an \"a priori \"diagnosis of BBS or BBS- like were studied using different molecular approaches (commercial genotyping microarrays, Sanger sequencing of specic genes and/or NGS technologies). Results: The characterization rate in our cohort was 79% (48/61 families). In 5 of the families, we found a possible triallelic inheritance, involving 6 out of the 7 affected cases.Three families carried biallelic BBS1 variants together with biallelic MKKS variants and one BBS5 and biallelic (c.724G>T; p.Ala242Ser) variant was found to be part in 3 families accompanying different biallelicvariants in BBS1 . In one family, the triallelic case showed a more severe phenotype than the biallelic affected sibling.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 183However, the phenotypic modi er effect of the triallelism could not be stablished in 4 of the families, as they were either unique cases or both affected showed triallelism. Conclusions: Our study presents triallelism as an option in BBS diagnosis, being important to consider it in genetic counselling.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular geneticcause in Czech patients with bilateral congenital or juvenile cataracts not associated with other ocular or systemic clin- icalndings. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed in 10 probands of Czech origin. Variants with minor allele frequency less than 0.005 as per GnomAD v.2were ltered and those located in genes known to be associated with cataract development as per Cat-Map database were given a priority for further evaluation.Conventional sequencing was used to follow segregation of the presumably pathogenic variants in available rst degree relatives. Results: Out of the 10 probands 6 had a family history of congenital or infantile cataracts. In total 5 variants classi ed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic as per American Collegeof Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines were identi ed. Two in were found in 5 probands. Conclusions: Herein we report for the rst time mutational spectrum of non-syndromic cataracts in Czech patient population. The failure to identify disease-causingvariants in half of the analysed cases suggests, that either the underlying mechanisms are not of genetic origin and/or that the pathogenic changes are not located in codingregions of the genome. Only two probands with family history of cataracts remained unsolved. Alternatively, larger structural variants or rearrangement could be alsoimplicated. Supported by AZV 17-30500A. J.

P02.08.A Insights into the retinal function of ciliopathy proteins gained through zebra sh models M. Masek, R. Bachmann-Gagescu University of Zurich- Medical Genetics, Z\u00fcrich, Switzer- land Ciliopathies are disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia, ubiquitous organelles involved in signal transduction. In retinal photoreceptors (PRs), light sensation occurs in theouter segments (OSs), which represent highly specialized ciliary compartments. Consequently, retinal disease is a common manifestation in ciliopathy patients. Our efforts toelucidate the molecular functions of ciliopathy proteins rely on zebra sh mutants in genes associated with Joubert iconic ciliopathy associated with retinal diseasein 25% of patients. We focus on genes that encode proteins participating in distinct ciliary complexes: Cc2d2a at the transition zone, representing the gate to the cilium, or Tal-pid3/KIAA0586 at the basal body (BB), anchoring the cilium in the cell. While both mutants display decreased visual function, we identify distinct ultra-structural pheno-types indicating speci c roles for each protein in primary cilium function. We nd that Cc2d2a organizes the vesicle fusion machinery at the periciliary margin and provides adocking point for incoming vesicles through a chain of interactions linking CC2D2A to NINL-MICAL3-RAB8. In contrast, Talpid3 is involved in BB docking and upstream of Rab8a activation. Retina-speci c tran- scriptomics identi es both shared and distinct effects on gene transcription: while transcription of phototransductiongenes is decreased in both mutants, likely as a secondary effect, we observe downregulation of the BBSome, a multi-184 J. del Picchiaprotein complex associated with the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl only in only in cc2d2a mutants. In conclusion, our ndings demonstrate how mutations in genes causing the same human disorder result in similar phenotypes through distinct mechanisms. M. Masek: None. R. Bachmann-Gagescu: None.

However, only 25-60% of patients receive genetic diagnoses. Structural variants are an important source of genetic variation, and have led to the identi cation of numerous eye development genes, including SOX2 and OTX2 . However, few studies systematically address their contribution to AMC. Here, we investigate a large cohort ofAMC families for known and novel copy number variants (CNVs). Materials and methods: A cohort of 320 unrelated probands was screened using either diagnostic genome- wide n=156), including Screening Array ( n=164). SNP analysed using the algorithms QuantiSNP and PennCNV. Variants of interest were validated using qPCR long-range PCR. Results: Our analysis identi ed multiple variants of interest, including likely pathogenic CNVs affecting known AMC genes and rare CNVs highlighting new candidates.We describe a novel homozygous 113kb deletion 19kb upstream of MAB21L2 , a developmental gene involved in eye morphogenesis. This deletion removes multiple con-served cis-regulatory elements. We also Our study supports the importance of CNV screening in routine diagnostic testing. It also highlights how CNVs affecting noncoding elements can provide insights into the role of regulatory regions of eyedevelopment genes in AMC.

It is characterized by a wide variety of clinical features that includes a typical facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, neutropenia, microcephaly, intel-lectual disability and severe visual impairments. In their early childhood, CS patients already suffer from myopia and a retinal dystrophy that affects both peripheral andcentral vision. In addition, long-term outcome studies showed that cataract reaches a high prevalence in adults with CS in their forties. To understand how VPS13B var- iants lead to these visual impairments and have the possi- bility to assess therapeutic approaches, we generated the Vps13b Ex3/Ex3mouse model. Cataract was almost sys- tematic in 2-month-old animals. Eye fundi appeared normal until cataract development, but OCT, ERG and histological data suggest that rod homeostasis may be affected in thefewVps13b Ex3/Ex3mice without cataract after 5 months of age. Immunostaining of the lens revealed that cataractAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 185formation was associated with the appearance large vacuoles in the cortical area, epithelial-mesenchymal tran- sition and brosis. In later stages, cataracts became hyper- mature, lens capsules ruptured, and sclerotic nuclear parts dissociated. Altogether, our results show that Vps13b has a function in lens homeostasis in mice and that theVps13b Ex3/Ex3mouse line is a useful model to study the pathomechanism leading to CS-related cataract.

P02.12.B Dominant cone rod dystrophy (CORD7) previously assigned to mutation of RIMS1 , is fully explained by co-inheritance of a dominant of PROM1 Schiff2, Moore1,2,3, London, King- dom,2Moor elds Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom, 3University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States A single missense variant (p.Arg820His) in RIMS1 has been associated with autosomal dominant cone rod dystrophy 7(CORD-7) and enhanced cognition. This was discovered in 2003 following linkage (LOD 3.61) to a 7cM region on chromosome 6q, in a four generation British family in 1998.The RIMS1 gene is often included in diagnostic panels for retinal dystrophy. However, despite this, no further families with CORD7 have been reported. Widespread availability of massively parallel sequencing has enabled detection of genomic variation at a scale not possible in the early 2000s. Access to vast datasets ingnomAD and Genomics England 100k genomes project (GE100KGP) now enables better understanding of the validity of previously accepted genetic associations. Interrogation of the gnomAD datasets reveal 10 carriers ofRIMS1 p.Arg820His (Non Finnish European allele frequency 0.0001). This would be unusual given theseverity of visual impairment in adulthood and absence of the variant in further patient cohorts. Four members of the original CORD7 family were recruited to the GE100KGP,where WGS showed the two affected members to be heterozygous for a well characterised dominant allele (p.Arg373Cys) of PROM1 located on chromosome 4p. All affected individuals subsequently were heterozygotes for this variant. Cytogenetic analysis excluded a balanced translocation that might explain co-segregation of a region on 6q and 4p. Thisnding suggests the rare occurrence of an alpha error despite robust linkage analysis in a large family. So far there is no evidence that perturbation of RIMS1 affects the retina in humans. G.

Kaneva1 1Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Molecular Medicine Center, Medical University of So a, Soa, Bulgaria,2Department of Neurology, University Hospital Alexandrovska, Medical University of So a, So a, Bulgaria Introduction: Fundus albipunctatus (FA) is a rare form of congenital stationary night blindness in which white or yellow dots can be seen scattered through the fundus. Individuals complain of night blindness early in childhoodwithout progression. By next-generation sequencing of clinical exome including all inherited retinal degeneration causative genes, we aimed to identify the disease-causingmutation in a patient with clinical signs of FA. Materials and Methods : Using Illumina \u00aeplatform and TruSight One, we identi ed heterozygous RLBP1 -mutation in a young patient, which results in phenotype consistent with FA. Results : A 5-years-old patient presenting ophthalmo- scopic phenotype including delayed dark adaptation, aggregation of yellowish-white lesions of various sizes in the retina, and slight vascular abnormalities, was screenedfor mutations in all known genes previously associated with inherited retinal degeneration. We identi ed a heterozygous mutation, c.346G>C (p.G116R), in the gene for cellularretinaldehyde-binding protein 1 ( RLBP1 ), already described in a pedigree affected by autosomal-recessive FA. All other genetic variants detected in the patient 's DNA were excluded after applying commonly used ltering criteria. Pedigree analysis showed the presence of p.G116Rmutation in the patient 's mother who was a heterozygous carrier. other's ophthalmological examination subse- quently con rmed pre-existing stationary night blindness, prolonged dark adaptation with preserved visual acuity strongly suggesting a phenotype consistent with FA. Conclusions : Most reported pedigrees are consistent with a recessive pattern of Mendelian inheritance of FA, although autosomal-dominant inheritance has been also reported. Our results suggest that mutation RLBP1- p. G116R may be considered as dominant-acting in pedigrees with autosomal-dominant FA. Acknowledgements: D01-285; None. I. Dimova: None. F. Shakola: None. V.

Through the international G-EAR Consortium, we united data from ten such cohorts from Europe, USA, Caucasus and Central Asia (overall >9000 individuals) and performeda GWAS meta-analysis on NHF and ARHL, analysing in the former case single hearing thresholds or their average value across speci c frequencies, and in the latter a case- control phenotype (PMID:29725052). Analyses used linearAbstracts from the 53rd European Society Genetics Interactive e-Posters association signals were detected on chromo- somes 3, 8, 11, 16 and 18. In particular, three genes - CADM2 ,CALB1 and LRRC4C - result to be potentially associated with NHF and two more - CDH13 andCTIF - with ARHL. CADM2 encodes a protein of the nectin-like family, members of which are fundamental for the development ofthe inner ear; CALB1 encodes a calcium-binding protein cochlear hair cells; LRRC4C encodes a transmembrane protein abundantly expressed in mouse inner ear. Finally, CDH13 and CTIF have been associated with NHF in previous studies, suggesting their possible role also in ARHL.

Since 2016, the gene CDC14A (Cell Division Cycle 14A) is associated with autosomal recessive non- syndromic HL (DFNB32) and hearing impairment and infertile male syndrome (HIIMS). Materials and Methods: In order to identify likely pathogenic variants of already known and novel HL genes in Iranian and Pakistani families with sensorineural HL, exome sequencing, gene mapping approaches and bioinfor-matics analysis was performed. Segregation testing of variants ensued. To investigate functional consequences on the RNA-level of both loss-of-function variants and toevaluate altered expression levels, we used assay for the splice variant (c.1421 for site variant (c.1421 +2T>C, p.?) responsible for the disruption of a splice donor site based on in silico predictiontools. Moreover, we identi ed a novel homozygous variant (c.1041dup, p.Ser348Glnfs*2) in the gene CDC14A . We observed that the c.1421 +T>C variant is responsible for the activation of a cryptic splice site resulting in a Signi cantly reduced CDC14A mRNA levels indicated a defective transcript due to the c.1041dup variant, which is likely targeted by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Conclusions: In summary, we identi ed and assessed the pathogenicity of two novel variants on the RNA-level and expand the spectrum of clinically relevant mutations in thegene CDC14A . J. Doll: None.

While pathogenic variants affecting the gene GJB2 account for roughly 10-30 % of NSHL, the majority of NSHL is distributed among more than 100 other genes. For many patients who do not bene t sufciently from hearing aids, cochlear implants (CIs) are the device of choice. Performance of CI recipients is expected to depend on genetic background and a favorable outcome has beenassociated with pathogenic variants in genes affecting the function of the cochlear sensory organ (CSO); a negative outcome was reported for patients with variants in genesassociated with spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) function. Patients : 129 unrelated hearing impaired children and adults without pathogenic variants in GJB2 and without evidence for acquired HL. Methods : Whole exome sequencing was performed analyzing 148 genes associated with HL listed in theDeafness Variation Database and additional 681 genes listed in the Human Phenotype Ontology database based on hearing impairment. Results : In 33 of 129 patients we identi ed pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 30 different genes, con rming the genetic heterogeneity of hereditary HL. Among thesewas one patient with a (homozygous) pathogenic variant in a gene proven to affect SGN function ( DFNB59 ). Conclusions: For meaningful results, a signi cantly higher number of cases is required. In addition, a further functional subdivision of patients with gene alterations influencing CSO function should be considered. C. Landgraf: None. S. von Hardenberg: None. A. Lesinski-Schiedat: None.

Bruque2, Argentina Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is the most common sensory disorder affecting 1 in 500 newborn children. Since HHL is related to more than 150 target genes, we designed a diagnosis strategy in order to identify pathogenic variants.A total of 1250 patients were analyzed for frequent muta- tions in GJB2 and GJB6 genes by 25% of them. From undiagnosed patients, 29families were selected to perform Whole exome sequencing. After ltering and analysis process, 45% of patients were genotyped, identifying 23 causative mutations (11 novel, 12reported) classi ed according to ACMG Standards. Some of the novel variants were further studied in silico by structural and stability studies of the mutated proteins. In addition,datasets from deafness and speci c variant databases were correlated with different protein motifs in order to predict the theoretical pathogenicity effect of the aminoacid chan-ges. Furthermore, knock-down phenotype rescue assays in zebra sh are underway to accomplish in vivo validation. In some cases, extensive analysis reinforced the pathogenicityprediction effect of variants and surprisingly, in one case, discouraged the deleterious effect of a genetic variant to the protein. Preliminary results in zebra sh con rmed the pathogenicity of one novel variant in the hair cell function and auditory system. This study shows that our algorithm is successful for the genetic diagnosis of deafness. Compre-hensive analysis is crucial to strengthen prediction of var- iant pathogenicity.

Oto-Rhino-Laryngology Surgery Clinic, Insti- tute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing, Warsaw, Poland, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Hearing loss (HL) is the most common dis- ability of human senses and genetic factors play animportant role in its development. Autosomal dominant HL (ADHL) is the second most common form of inherited HL, characterized by postlingual age of onset and progression.To date 63 loci with 47 different genes were causally involved in ADHL. Materials and Methods : Multigenerational families with ADHL were recruited for the study ( n=44). Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and buccal swabs samples. A high-throughput sequencing with custommultigene panel was performed on probands 'DNA samples. Family segregation analysis of the identi ed variants was conducted using Sanger sequencing. Alldetected variants were analyzed in the context of population databases and available literature. Pathogenicity of the identi ed variants was predicted by different computational approaches. Results : Genetic testing revealed probably pathogenic variants in about 52% (23/44) of the analyzed families. Themajority of identi ed variants were novel, previously not reported and hitherto not linked to the disease. The most frequent genes with identi : Our study revealed a high involvement of novel probably pathogenic variants in the development ofADHL and con rmed a high heterogeneity of the identi ed genetic changes. High-throughput sequencing in HL patients generates large amount of data that should beinterpreted carefully and con rmed by family studies. There is also a need for functional validation of the detected novel variants. Supported by : NCN Research Grant no. 2016/22/ E/NZ5/00470 BIS6 M. M.L. None. A. Sarosiak: None. H. Skarzynski: None. P02.24.B Wide spectrum of genetic hearing loss causes and large number of novel variants in cochlea implanted children D. M. L. Leja1,2, H. Skarzynski3, M. Oldak1 1Department of Genetics, Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing, Warsaw, Poland,2Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland,3Oto-Rhino-LaryngologySurgery Clinic, Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Every year, approximately 1-6/1000 children are born with severe to profound hearing loss (HL). For this group of patients cochlear implantation (CI) is the treatment ofchoice. In the majority of deaf children HL is determined by DFNB1 locus pathogenic variants. Here, we aim to dissect the genetic background of HL in DFNB1-negative CI patients. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of carefully selected DFNB1-negative patients with profound prelingual HL ( n=50) and their family members. In all probands whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by bioinformatics and expert analysis were performed. Standard Sanger sequencing was used forvalidation of selected variants, family segregation analysis and detection of the CEVA haplotype. Copy number variants were con rmed with qPCR. Results: In every tested subject WES revealed at least 5 probably pathogenic variants in HL-related genes. Causa- tive variants were identi ed in 33 patients and in 39% (13/ 33) of them they were inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Among the detected 53 disease-causing alleles, 55% (29/53) contained novel genetic alterations. Conclusions: Obtained results show a high heterogeneity of genetic HL causes in the population of Polish DFNB1- negative cochlea-implanted patients. In children with nofamily history of HL, the possibility of identifying causative variants inherited in both autosomal recessive and dominant manner should be taken into account. In patients with anunknown genetic cause of HL, the tested area should be expanded with whole genome analysis. Supported by NCN grant: 2017/27/N/NZ5/02369 D. P02.25.C Diagnostic Ef ciency of Clinical Exome Solution Panel in patients with Hearing loss/Hereditary Deafness byusing Next Generation Sequencing (HL)/Hereditary Deafness (HD) is a hetero- geneous disease which multiple genes have been found tobe implicated in the disease etiopathogenesis. Genetic diagnosis is highly important for HL/HD patients in order to190 J. del Picchiaensure the etiology of the condition and counsel the patients properly. In this study, 41 patients (22M/19F) who admitted to our clinic between February 2018 and November 2019 with HL/HD were screened for 110 genes related with syndromic/non-syndromic HL/HD. NGS is considered to be the best practice for diagnosis. Large gene panels also canevaluate non-prevelant genes and candidate variants speci c to populations. All exons and exon-intron boundaries were amplifed by using Clinical Exome (Sophia Genetics)Solution kit platform, classi ed according to ACMG criteria with in-silico tools and also investigated by HGMD Professional 2019-4 and other available online bioinformatic tools. We identi ed CNV in three patients, 26 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 19 of 41 HL/ HD patients (46 %) in 10 different genes. Similarly, 23 variants of uncertain signi cance are determined in 18 of 41 HL/HD patients (43 %) in 18 distinct genes. Besides these variations, we found 31 novel variations that are not reported before in literature or databases. Our study af rms that genetic screening of patients with HL by using CES panel not only easily diagnoses but also help counseling the patients and their family for their future risk of developingthe disease.

Giuliani1, 7Interdipartimental Program for molecular diagnosis and characterization of pathogenic mechanisms of rare genetic diseases, Siena, Italy,8Clinical Genetics. hearing loss (HL) is one of the most genetically heterogeneous disorders. Although pathogenicvariants in GJB2 account for a large proportion of cases, many patients remain undiagnosed after DFNB1 testing. NGS analysis of HL-genes to simultaneously search for nucleotide variants and copy number variants (CNVs) greatly improve the detection rate. Materials and methods: clinical exome sequencing followed by in silico analysis of HL-gene panel (106 genes) was carried out on 117 patients on which DFNB1 pathogenic variants were previously excluded. Eightycases show prelingual or childhood deafness while in 37 patients HL was progressive with variable age of onset. Clinical interpretation of genetic variants was performedaccording to ACMG2015 by InterVar and Varsome tools and revised according to the speci c guidelines for HL- genes. Results: Forty-eight pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and eight pathogenic CNVs (6 STRC -CATSPER2 and 2 OTOA whole gene deletions) were identi ed with an overall detection rate of 26.5%. Speci c detection rate was 32% (12/37) for adult cases and 24% in children. In particular, NGS identi ed 12 different pathogenic variants in dominant, 28 in recessive and 8 in dominant/recessive genes. The genes most involved were SLC26A4 and STRC. A single pathogenic variant in SLC26A4 gene was found in7 cases. Conclusions: overall detection rate of the test is in line with available data. MLPA analysis in target genes such asSLC26A4 should be performed to exclude the presence of a deletion at exonic level in cases where a single variant as been identi ed. F. Gerundino: None. C.

Mutations in gene GJB2 encoding transmembrane proteinAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 191Cx26 are the common cause for hearing loss worldwide. We present a complex assessment of pathogenicity of novel non-synonymous variant c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) in GJB2 found with high frequency in deaf patients belonging to indigenous peoples of Southern Siberia (Tuvinians and Altaians). Materials & Methods: Genetic analysis was performed in group of deaf patients and ethnically matched controls. The GJB2 knockout HeLa cell line (obtained by CRISPR/ Cas9 system) was used to establishment of transgenic HeLa cell lines with different pathogenic GJB2 -variants and GJB2- wt. Cellular Cx26 localization was investigated by immunocytochemistry (ICC). The Cx26-channels perme- ability was analyzed by dye (PI) loading assay. Results: Segregation of variant c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) with hearing loss was established in analysis of pedigrees of deaf patients and its frequency was signi cantly higher in patient 's group than in controls. Most of in silico programs predicted a likely damaging effect of p.Trp172Cys. ICC showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization of the Cx26-p.Trp172Cys protein in contrast to Cx26-wt whichrepresented distinct conglomerates on cell membrane. Dye (PI) loading assay revealed lower PI loading ef ciencies in cells expressing mutant variant Cx26-p.Trp172Cys com-pared to Cx26-wt while the absence of PI accumulation was shown for other mutant Cx26-variants with known pathogenic effects. Conclusions: Several lines of evidences support patho- genicity of novel variant c.516G>C (p.Trp172Cys) in gene GJB2 and its involving in hearing loss.

Alhazzaa King Faisal Specialist Hospital and research centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory disorders in humans with both genetic and environmental etiologies. Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common cause ofcombined blindness and deafness. Molecular diagnosis is of great signi cance in revealing the molecular pathogenesis and aiding the clinical diagnosis of this disease. Our study aims to comprehensively delineate the genetic basis of hearing loss in the individuals of Saudi Arabianorigin. The identi cation of the causative gene in affected families with hearing loss is dif cult due to extreme genetic heterogeneity and lack of phenotypic variability. Consan- guineous families are a powerful resource for genetic linkage studies/homozygosity mapping for recessively inherited hearing impairment. Homozygosity mapping,linkage next generation sequencing Deafness Gene-panel and Whole Exome sequencing were conducted. Using the combined approaches, so far mutations in 32different deafness genes including novel genes rst time identi ed in this population, have been identi ed. More than 300 familial/sporadic cases were solved, includingnovel variants in known HL genes. Using these innovative molecular approaches, we were able to document the most common forms of hereditaryhearing loss, their incidence and distribution in the Saudi population. The overall results of this study are highly suggestive that the underlying molecular basis of hearing loss in Saudi Arabia is very genetically heterogeneous. The benet of this study will hopefully provide the foundation for knowledge and awareness through screening of carrierstatus and genetic counselling, thereby having a major impact upon early intervention for and prevention of hereditary hearing loss.

It can be isolated or syndromic. Molecular diagnosis through whole exome sequencing(WES) can allow an improved management and surveil- lance of HI and possible associated anomalies. Here we show the results of a 3 years 'experience of Ear-nose-and- throat (ENT) Genetics Genome boards. Materials and Methods: Our cohort includes children with mild to profound, unilateral or bilateral HI referred byENT clinic from 2017 to 2019. We performed WES with bioinformatics analysis of 189 genes associated with HI. The results are discussed during a genome board wheregeneticists and ENT specialists confront the genetic variants found by WES with the auditory phenotype of the patients.192 J. del PicchiaResults: We tested 38 children, most often with moderate, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The diag- nostic rate was 52.6% (20/38). associated or not with infertility in males. Conclusions: The diagnostic yield of our study (52.6%) is comparable to recent data in the literature. A genetic assessment of HI in young children makes the identi cation of the molecular cause possible, and permits to anticipatepossible complications particularly in the case of syndromic forms with medical problems involving other organs or systems. Collaboration between ENT specialists andgeneticists is essential to make an accurate and precise diagnosis and to personalize the follow-up and treatment of these young patients. M.

P02.30.B utility of exome sequencing for hereditary eye diseases: single-centre experience M. Volk 1, N. Teran1, A. heritable conditions with ocular involvement have been described to date. These include isolated eye diseases (retinal degeneration, cataract, corneal dystrophy, optic atrophy, developmental ocular anomalies),as well as complex genetic syndromes with ocular mani- festations. This group of disorders is genetically hetero- geneous and diagnostically challenging. The aim of ourstudy was to determine the clinical diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in hereditary eye diseases. Materials and Methods: 243 Slovene unselected con- secutive patients were referred to our institution from November 2013 to October 2019 because of suspected hereditary eye disease. We performed exome sequencingwith the mitochondrial sequence analysis based on the off- target exome reads. Filtered variants were analyzed according to population frequency, characterization in theClinVar database, the putative impact of the variant, and predicted pathogenicity. Variants were classi ed accordingto ACMG standards and guidelines for variant interpretation. Results: We found causative pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 102 patients. The diagnostic yield was 50% for retinal degeneration (78/156), 20% for optic atrophy syndromic disease (11/19). Conclusions: The overall diagnostic yield for ophtalmo- genetic referral in a cohort of unselected consecutive patients was 42%. Therefore, the exome sequencing is acost-effective and ef cient comprehensive approach that should be considered as a rst-tier investigation for diagnostics of hereditary eye diseases. M. Volk: None.

The geneticlandscape of non-syndromic HL includes over 100 genes. In aggregate, these genes harbor several thousand causally implicated variants. The observation of recurrent variantsraises the question about whether variants arose from a single ancestral allele or were the result of independent mutational events. In our study that includes 150 Iranianprobands, we identi ed 15 families with recurrent likely pathogenic in the genes SMPX ,SLC26A4 ,TECTA andTMIE sequenced following Illumina exome protocols. LibrariesAbstracts from the 53rd of Human Genetics (ESHG) Interactive e-Posters 193were and copy number variation analysis were performed using GensearchNGS and an in-house exome analysis pipeline. Segregation analysis was performed for all families. Haplotype reconstruction allowed comparison across families. Results: Haplotype analysis of the c.99del variant in SMPX that was identi ed in three Iranian families suggested a common descent. Interestingly, this X-linked variant wasdescribed as a founder mutation in an isolated Newfound- land population. In addition, more than one recurrent mutation was identi ed in the genes SLC26A4 andTECTA in families with autosomal recessive HL that was consistent with a founder effect. In three additional families, the c.250C>T variant in TMIE was implicated in autosomal recessive HL without sharing further common variants, suggesting a mutational hotspot. Conclusions: The genetic origin of recurrent mutations could be interesting for further characterization of HL genes with respect to ethnic background and susceptibility of mutational events. M.A.H.

The use of high-throughput genometechnologies has made great strides in the discovery of new alleles/genes identi cation. Here, 714 deeply clinically characterized patients were screened with a Targeted Re-Sequencing (TRS) panel of 96 deafness genes and, in negative cases, SNP-arrays were applied. Afterwards, families negative to both approaches were analysed byWhole Exome Sequencing (WES) for new candidates ~28% of the familial and 20% sporadic cases) highlighting STRC andTECTA as the second major players in the Italian population after GJB2 . Then, WES allowed the identi cation of ve new HHL genes, two of them (SLC12A2 and USP48 ) just identi ed. three-generation HHL family. The variant is predicted as deleterious by several bioinformatic prediction tools and is not reported in any public database.Interestingly, studies in mouse and zebra sh models demonstrated Slc12a2 expression in the inner ear and its involvement in hearing loss. Moreover, to better evaluatethe pathogenic effect of the identi ed variant, an in silico protein modelling has been performed suggesting that the substitution identi ed might alter the correct folding of the protein. Thanks to this approach ~35% (60% familial cases and 20% sporadic ones) of cases have been characterized conrming the large mutation 's spectrum of HHL, and the importance of an accurate clinical diagnosis.

In many paediatric patients, genetic diagnosis is crucial for prognostics and future planning. Methods: 76 probands and 22 affected family members were ascertained, and a detailed medical and family history was obtained. Ophthalmological assessment consisted,194 J. del Picchiawhen feasible, of: best-corrected OCT), fluorescein angiography and electrophysiological assessment. DNA was isolated from blood samples, andproband samples underwent targeted next-generation sequencing for 108 known IRD genes. Results: In the vast majority of affected individuals the genetic analyses con rmed the initial diagnosis; some diagnoses, however, needed to be revised. Causal variants were found in 2/3 of the families. In ve cases, monoallelic pathogenic alterations were found in autosomal recessive genes. Most commonly mutated genes in this cohort were ABCA4 (23 individuals), CNGA3 (5) and CEP290 (4). Conclusions: Genetic analysis is crucial to achieve accurate diagnosis and prognosis, which enables informed choices for the future of the affected children. Manyprobands were the rst individual suffering from IRD in the family. An important role of genetic diagnostics is to inform the parents about their risk for having another child with thedisease. Finally, emerging targeted gene therapies indicate a chance of slowing or stopping the disease progression. Funding: National Science Centre (Poland) grant no. UMO-2015/19/D/NZ2/03193. 1 K.H.

Theaim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield of whole exome sequencing (WES) in patients with HM. Materials and methods: Patients with HM were recruited by ophthalmologists and clinical geneticists. Clinical features were categorized into isolated HM, HM with other ocular features or syndromic HM with systemicinvolvement. WES was performed using a vision gene panel including 477 genes. Results: WES was performed in 50 patients with HM; the majority had isolated HM (75%). A genetic cause was identi ed in 11 patients (22%; mean age at diagnosis 9.4 years (SD 7.5); mean refractive error -12.60 diopters (SD6.22)). Four patients ( GUCY2D ;FAM161A; PDE6H; CAC- a ARR3 mutation (X-linked female limited high myopia); 2 patients had homozygous or compound heterozygous COL18A1 mutations (Knobloch syndrome); 1 patient had a COL2A1 mutation (Stickler syndrome); 1 patient had a PAX6 mutation. In 14 patients (28%) a variant of unknown signi cance was found; follow- up examinations are necessary. Conclusions: The diagnostic yield of our WES vision gene panel for HM was 22%. It enabled us to diagnose various causes of HM, i.e. retinal dystrophies, connectivetissue diseases, and non-syndromic HM, allowing appro- priate follow up of systemic and ocular features and genetic counselling.

T\u00fcbingen, Ger-many, 5University Ophthalmology, University of T\u00fcbingen, Tuebingen, Germany,6WernerAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 195Reichardt Centre of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany Introduction: The aim of this cohort study was to unravel the molecular basis of inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) in a large cohort of 2,156 affected patients diagnosed andfollowed-up in the largest center for inherited retinal dis- eases in Germany. Our study cohort accounts for approxi- mately 7% of the estimated 30,000 IRD patients inGermany, thereby providing representative data for the prevalence and the mutation spectrum of IRD genes and mutations for the population in Germany. Presently, morethan 260 `disease genes 'are known to cause IRDs. The identi cation of the underlying disease-causing mutations has been accelerated by the introduction of next-generation-sequencing technologies (NGS). Within the eld of NGS platforms, the targeted capture of known 'disease genes ' with its strong optimization of coverage on relevant targetshas been proven superior over whole exome sequencing with respect to read depth and on-target ef ciency. Materials and Methods: DNA samples were analyzed by targeted NGS and, whenever indicated, multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli cation (MLPA). Patients analyzed by Sangersequencing and MLPA. Results: We achieved an overall molecular diagnostic solving rate of 70.8%. A total of 1,161 distinct variantswere identi ed, including 501 novel variants, reaf rming the known vast genetic heterogeneity of IRD in a mainly outbred European population. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the clinical utility of panel-based NGS in a large and highly heterogeneous cohort from an outbred population and for the rst time gives a comprehensive representation of the genetic land- scape of IRDs in Germany.

Here we present two patients, a 9-year-old girl with cone dystrophy and a 43-year old man with rod-cone dystrophy, initially referred to the Department of Ophthalmology to con rm inherited retinal disease. Material and Methods: Genomic DNA was processed using the TruSeq DNA for librarypreparation and on a NovaSeq6000 System (Illu- mina). Data analysis was conducted using an in-housebioinformatics pipeline optimized for structural/copy num- ber variant detection. Results: WGS of the girl identi ed a clinically relevant homozygous deletion in CLN3 . The detected deletion c.461- 280_677 +382del, p.? is the most frequent with autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. by seizures, psychomotor degenera- tion and visual failure. Clinical course is progressive andunfavorable. WGS of the man identi ed 1 de ciency. This mitochon- drial disease is characterized by a variable clinical phenotype including neuromuscular, cardiovascular andmetabolic symptoms and visual impairment. The detected variant has been described before in another patient with rod-cone dystrophy. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance to inform patients about the possibility of retinal disease being the leading clinical manifestation of unexpected inheritedsystemic disorders. Thus, comprehensive genetic counsel- ing and appropriate documentation of informed consent is crucial prior to performing WGS. A. Liebmann: None. P. Mazzola: None. K. Stingl: None. T. Heinrich: None.

P02.44.A Shift of T-cell repertoire cornea and Clinical Center of Physical- Chemical Medicine of Federal Medical Biological Agency, Moscow, Russian Federation,2S. Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex Federal State Institution, Ministry of Health of Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Keratoconus is a pathologic condition of the eye which results in thinning and cone-shaped deformationof cornea. While its precise cause is still unknown, kera- toconus is considered to be a multifactorial disease, and immune processes are assumed to contribute to its devel-opment, yet little data is available so far on the immune microenvironment of cornea in affected patients. Here we present the assessment of T cell repertoire in cornea andblood samples from 3 patients with keratoconus who underwent cornea transplantation. Materials and Methods: RNA was extracted from PBMC and cornea samples with RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). RNA libraries of TCR-alpha and TCR-beta transcripts were prepared using SMARTer Human TCR a/b Pro ling Kit (Takara Bio USA Inc.) and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform. TRA and TRB clonotypes samples for all 3 patients demonstrated signicantly lower clonotype diversity than corresponding PBMC samples. We observed a shift of T cell repertoire in cornea compared to PBMC samples. The top abundantTCR clones in cornea were poorly represented or absent in corresponding blood samples, which indicates that they represent a tissue-speci c population. For most of the CDR3 variants detected in cornea, no speci cities against known antigens were found, and further research is needed to identify possible functions of these T cellpopulations.

P02.45.B Genomic landscape in spanish patients with ocular malformations by next generation sequencing A. Dami\u00e1n 1, Moya1, Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain Human eye development is coordinated by complex developmental processes which involves several hundredsof genes. Any disruption in this regulation during the eye organogenesis can lead to ocular malformations such as Microphthalmia- Anophthalmia-Coloboma (MAC). Thesediseases are very clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions with overlapping phenotypes; consequently the mutational load is not well known and the genotype-phenotype correlations can be dif cult to de ne. Our aim was to perform a comprehensive molecular screening in a cohort of Spanish patients with ocular malformations usingdifferent approaches of next-generation sequencing (NGS). We have ndings in around 52% of the patients. One-third carried likely causal mutations, 8% were partially char-acterized and 8% had VUS. Different casual mutations were found and the most prevalent in our cohort are transcription factors such as OTX2, SOX2, VSX2 and PAX6. In contrast,others variants have expanded the phenotypic spectrum of some genes classically associated with other phenotypes such as GJA8, KERA, or the lens crystallins family genessuggesting new roles of them in the early development of the eye. This results show that not only NGS is ef cient for the genetic analysis of ocular malformations but also forachieving new candidate genes. Therefore, we have update our gene panels resulting in an increase in our diagnostic yield. In contrast, 34% of patients remain uncharacterized,mostly unilateral or non-syndromic cases. So that, our future purposes are to understand the mechanisms involved in this disease by identifying novel genetic causes andexploring their functional role. A. Dami\u00e1n: None. A. Tamayo: None.

They are collectively named MAC (Micro- phthalmia-Anophthalmia-Coloboma), characterized by a tremendous clinical heterogeneity and often associated withother ocular abnormalities such as anterior segment dys- genesis (ASD). We aimed to set up an exome-based gene panel test for MAC-ASD. Materials and Methods: Sample preparation was done with the SureSelectXT Low Input Human All Exon V7 kit using Bravo (Agilent Technologies) and pooled librarieswere sequenced on a HiSeq 3000 or NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) aiming for a minimal coverage of 20x for at least 90% of the investigated regions. Data analysis wasexecuted with a bcbio-based pipeline and variant ltering with in-house Seqplorer software. Copy number variant (CNV) analysis was done using ExomeDepth. Results: As of May 2018, 26 patients, 12 with MAC (46.2%) and 14 with ASD (53.8%), underwent MAC- ASD panel analysis. The overall diagnostic yield was 9/26 (34.6%), in line with the reported range (11-36%). ASD has the highest yield (50%), compared to MAC (16.7%). In seven out of the nine cases a (likely)pathogenic variant was a CNV encompassing FOXC1 was found.Conclusions: Exome-based MAC-ASD panel analysis revealed a molecular diagnosis in 34.6% of a MAC-ASD cohort, highlighting the ef cacy of H.

P02.47.A The enigma of Midfacial Toddler Excoriation Syndrome (MiTES), a PRDM12 N. Sarveswaran1,G. Woods1, 1Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom,2Birmingham Children 's hospital, Bir- mingham, United Kingdom Mid-face toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES) is a new sensory disease rst described in 2017 (PMID: 28028858). We report 12 cases in 7 families. The phenotype is of intense itch in early childhood, which causes mutilating self-injury by scratching. The intense itch is localised onlyto the midface and no other body parts; is not associated with altered sweating; it spontaneously subsides by 4-6 years; cognition and pain sensing is normal; there is noexcess of Staph Aureus infections (on the face or else- where). Inheritance appeared recessive, as parents were unaffected, males and females were equally affected, andmost cases were consanguineous. Older individuals \"grow out\"of the condition, facial injuries heal, and have normal whole-body itch and pain sensing. In six of seven families,we found the same mutation in affected individuals - a homozygous poly-Alanine repeat expansion from the nor- mal range (7-13) to 18. Parents were always carriers. Thiswas also found in a non-Asian, Caucasian, non- consanguineous family. In the seventh family, we found only a heterozygous 7 base pair deletion in PRDM12, butno second mutation. What is extraordinary is that a PRDM12 homozygous 19 poly-Alanine repeat expansion causes Congenital Insensitivity to Pain; which is not asso-ciated with excess itch, leads to self-in flicted lip, tongue and corneal damage, and always cause excess S. Aureus infec- tions. No other poly-alanine tract expansion disease has twophenotypes. We present our cellular studies to try and198 J. del Picchiaunderstand the disease mechanism whereby a single addi- tional alanine can cause such different phenotypes. N. G. Woods: None. C.

Zinchenko Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Congenital aniridia (OMIM#106210) is an autosomal dominant eye disorder mainly caused by heterozygous PAX6 mutations or 11p13 chromosome rearrangements. Pathogenic variants in some other genes could cause overlapping phenotypes, also, PAX6 missense mutations could be associated with other than aniridia phenotypes. Atotal of 208 unrelated families (256 patients) with clinical diagnoses of either congeni tal aniridia, counting WAGR syndrome, or overlapping ophthalmological diagnosescharacterized by iris hypoplasia were included in the study. Familial to sporadic proportion counted for 44/164. A combination of Sanger PAX6 sequencing, loci was implemented. 204 out of 208 families (98%) were found to have either heterozygous pathogenicnucleotide sequence variant or chromosome deletion. Disease-causing variants in PAX6 and deletions in 11p13 were families. 30.3% of the cohort carried pathogenic CNVs (62 in 11p13 and 1 in 6p25.3). A frequent 11p13 deletion ofPAX6 3-cis-regulatory region was determined (16/208, 7.7%). The frequency of this deletion in the cohort was higher than PAX6 hotspot c.718C>T rate (9/208, 4.3%). In total, repeated PAX6 were (18,8%) families, downstream dele- counted for 6/208 (2.8%). Mutational spectrum peculiarities in a large cohort of Russian families with congenital aniridia were established.

We aimed to identify enhancers, cis- regulatory elements regulating gene expression, associatedwith myopia leveraging summary statistics of previous genome-wide association studies Materials and Methods: GWAS on myopia related phenotypes (148,485 European, 11,935 Asian individuals) from CREAM and 23andMe were used to examine the association between enhancer-related SNPs and myopia.We obtained enhancer regions (N total=12,244) active in eye- related human tissues from the FANTOM5 database and performed a look-up of these regions in the GWAS. Weprioritized enhancers and ANNOVAR determined target genes by on LD, eQTLs, enhancer Results: We selected enhancers expressed in 3 eye- related tissue types (N =7,944), of which 4,610 enhancers (N SNPs=9,253) were available in the GWAS for analysis. The look-up of these regions yielded 15 signi cant SNPs clustering in 12 enhancers regions exceeding the ARL11 (~27 genes. Interestingly, SNPs RCBTB1 were associated with myopia in the GWAS. Conclusions: We selected enhancers with putative target genes, as RCBTB1 (RCC1 and BTB domain containing protein 1), that could explain signi cant loci identi ed in GWAS and play None. P02.53.A Functional analysis of a novel Myo6 variant in hereditary hearing loss family from Qatar M. K. Al-Kowari1,2,S .D a 'as1, M. Guarch1,D 1Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar,2Biological and Biomedical Program, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar Introduction: Hereditary Hearing Loss (HHL) is a com- mon genetic disorder accounting for at least 60% of pre-lingual deafness in children. The long tradition of con- sanguinity among Qatari population increases the pre- valence of HHL. A novel missense variant in Myo6 was detected in two siblinges diagnosed with severe to profound HL (Alkowari et al. 2017). Prediction tools revealed that this variant is pathogenic and conserved. Materials and methods: We functionally validate the pathogenicity of the novel variant using both cellular and animal models. HeLa cells were transiently transfected withplasmids carrying wildtype and mutated human Myo6 .A zebra sh model was generated using morpholino knock down and co-injection with synthetic RNA ( with Myo6WTandMyo6p. E60Q, overexpressed the same amount of protein. Cells with Myo6WTshowed localization of the protein in both cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. In contrast, Myo6p. E60Qis not expressed in the plasma membrane but it 's restricted to the cytoplasm. Zebra sh model resulted in severe otic defects. Myo6p.E60QRNA injection resulted in alterations in the saccule that is responsible for hearing inzebra sh ear. Additionally, we found that zebra sh with Myo6 p.E60Qdisplayed shorter, less abundant and disordered hair bundles in otic hair cells when compared to control andMyo6 WTinjected zebra sh.

With about 120 genes implicated, non- syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is extremely genetically heterogeneous. In this study, we investigated extended Iranian families with hereditary NSHL to uncover thegenetic landscape and characterize its genetic heterogeneity. Materials and Methods: Using molecular inversion probes (MIPs), we targeted 89 genes involved in NSHL in20 patients. Exome sequencing (ES) was performed in 102 and MIP-screened NSHL pro- bands. Sanger sequencing, homozygosity mapping, andin vitro functional assays were used to con rm selected variants. Results: Our analysis resolved 50% (10/20) of the MIP- screened patients and about 76% (78/102) of patients subjected to ES. The overall diagnostic rate is about 78.5% (88/112). Nearly half of the diagnostic yield edCLRN2 as a novel NSHL gene in a family. A novel variant in the SPATA5 gene, known to cause epilepsy, hearing loss, and mental retardation syndrome, was implicated in a family with HL as the soleclinical feature. Conclusions: Using two approaches, we could resolve roughly 78.5% of the patients undergoing genetic screeningfor NSHL. Our cohort also uncovered LOXHD1 as a highly prevalent gene in NSHL diagnoses that was not similarly observed in large cohort screenings of Iranian HL patients.Furthermore, we introduce CLRN2 and SPATA5 as NSHL genes.

Kadyshev , T. A. Vasilyeva, A. V. Marakhonov, S. I. Kutsev, R. A. Zinchenko FSBSI Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation The expression of the PAX6 gene is realized in the forma- tion of almost all structures of the eye - the cornea, iris, lens, optic nerve and central part of the retina. Accounting this fact, the clinical spectrum expands when there is a singlepathogenetic process. Materials and methods. The sample of patients with hereditary ophthalmological pathology was 31 children (0-16 years old). The examination included clinical(ophthalmoscopy, biomicroscopy, gonyoscopy, visometry, tonometry), instrumental (electrophysiological, molecular genetic (NGS, directSanger sequencing, MLPA) research methods. Results. Accounting the topographical principle, mutations in the PAX6 gene led to lesions in both the anterior and posterior segments of the eyeball. Structures such as the optic disc and/or macular zone (posterior segment) are affected in 100% of cases. The lesion of the anterior segment of the eyeis characterized by the involvement of different structures in the process: 6 patients had corneal changes of different grades (ex.; c. 1184-2_1184delAGGinsGGA PAX6 het; c.1184-2_1184delAGGinsGGA PAX6 het); the lens (NM_000280. 4(PAX6_v001):c. 765G>A het synchronous splicing); 7 patients had differentgrades of iris pathology. One patient with mutation NM_000280.4(PAX6_v001):c.109dupG had a congenital malformation-colobomatous microphthalmos. Two patientshad anterior segment lens) PAX6 IVS5a-3T>C het; c.718C>T, p.(Arg240*)). Mutations in the PAX6 gene have a multitopographic effect on the eye, with the devel- opment of pathology in the anterior and posterior segments of the eyeball. Supported by RFBR grant 18-015-00090.

Guidara, H. de g\u00e9n\u00e9tique m\u00e9dicale, CHU Hedi Chaker, Sfax, Tunisia Peters plus syndrome is an autosomal recessive rare dis- order comprising ocular anterior segment dysgenesis, shortstature, hand abnormalities, distinctive facial features. It was related only to mutations in the B3GALTL gene (13q12.3), leading to the inactivation of the B1, 3-glucosyltransferase. In this study, we report 9 patients with typical Peters plus syndrome. Ocular abnormality, facial dysmorphism, and rhizomelic dwar sm were present in all cases. We noted the presence of 2 new anomalies not previously described in Peters Plus syndrome, namely renal malformation and sexual ambiguity. Total sequencing of theB3GALTL gene showed the presence of the splicing muta- tion (c.597-2A> G) in the B3GALTL gene in 7 patients. This mutation harbours a novel splice site mutation in theB3GALTL gene that modulates the mRNA secondary structure.

The aim of this study was to identify presbycusis causative genes by whole exome sequencing (WES). Patients and methods: We analysed 105 families, 122 simplex cases and 120 normal-hearing controls. After an in silico bioinformatic analysis to select predicted pathogenic variants, and according to the autosomaldominant mode of inheritance in 95% of the families, we studied very rare heterozygous variants (allele frequency : AF0.0001). Results: We found ratio in by 24.7% of mARHL from three individuals carrying GJB2 biallelic variants) than in the controls (6,7%) (p < 0,001). By studing a mouse model Tmc1 N321I, we con rmed the pathogenicity of the mutation leading to congenital moderate hearing loss in homozygous mice due to a reduced mechanotransductioncurrent amplitude, and to a progressive hearing loss beginning at 7 months and affecting the high frequencies in heterozygous carriers, validating also the mutation asresponsible for a monogenic form of presbycusis. Conclusions: WES unraveled that a large proportion of severe presbycusis is due to new mutations in autosomaldominant deafness genes arguing for a genetic continuum between early-onset deafness and presbycusis. We demon- strated also the existence of monogenic forms of presby-cusis that could be targetted by new personnalized therapies like gene therapy.

Lo To determine a possible association between mitochondrial variations and primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG) in a Dutch discovery cohort. Materials and Methods: 140 mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) IlluminaInnium Global Screening Array-24 (GSA) 700K array set. Genetic analysis was performed in a case-control discovery202 J. del Picchiacohort of 734 patients with POAG and 1,417 controls. The variants were classi ed and analyzed both as single SNPs and as haplogroups. SNP association was performed using logistic regression. The bioinformatics software HaploGrep was used to determine the haplogroup. The Chi-square test and Fisher 's two-sided exact test were used for haplogroups association. Results: For discovery, a nominal association with POAG was found for the allele A of m.11915G/A(rs2853496, p =0.016), within the MT-ND4 gene. The odds ratio was 0.80 (95% con dence interval 0.67-0.95) per copy of the rare allele and adjusted for gender. No haplogroupwas associated with POAG in our cohort. Conclusions: The present study reinforces the concept that mitochondrial variation contributes to POAG suscept-ibility.

Warsaw, Poland,2Chair of Ophthalmology, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland,3Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland A Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) approach was adopted, as a part of the recently accomplished NeuStemGen project, for identifying genetic causes of inherited retinal dystro- phies (IRD) in a cohort of Polish patients. Project outcomesprompted the development of a targeted retinal panel, covering most pathogenic variants occurring in the Polish population. WES was performed for 105 patients with clinical symptoms of retinal dystrophies. A targeted panel, consist- ing of 278 IRD genes (including deep intronic regions forABCA4 ), was used to sequence 29 IRD samples, including 6 samples not resolved by WES. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using standard BWA-GATK best practice pipe-line and several databases, including POLGENOM, frequency number variants were using Over 50 pathogenic/potentially pathogenic variants were identi ed using the WES analysis, involving genes alreadyknown to cause IRD. The diagnostic yield of this approach, however, did not exceed 60%. The pilot sequencing of the targeted retinal panel resulted in a signi cantly higher coverage (389x vs 78x), 98-99% concordance ed variants and allowed to develop a CNV analysis pipeline. Data obtained using these two approaches were compared and support the decision of applying the large targeted panel for routine diagnostics of retinal dystrophies. This approach, focused on the complete set of retinal genes, assuring a highquality coverage and allowing for reliable analysis of CNVs and deep intronic variants, should be most ef cient and cost-effective for a large cohort of Polish patients.

Speci c genotypes have, however, been associated with isolated retinal disease in a few reported individuals, thereby further extending the genes that can result in both syndromic and non-syndromic IRD.

P02.64.C First systematic molecular genetic analysis using NGS analysis of 100 Greek patients with retinal dystrophy S. Kamakari 1, S. Koukoula2, and Greece,3Department Ophthalmological Institute of Athens, Athens, Greece,5Department of Ophthalmology, University of Crete School of Medicine, Heraklion, Greece Purpose: Inherited Retinal Dystrophies (IRDs) are char- acterized by clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to molecularly diagnose 100 Greek patients with different forms of IRDs. Materials and Methods: 100 unrelated Greek patients were analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), 13 and 87 of them using a 105 retinal and a 287 ophthalmicgene panel, respectively as described (Ellingford JM et al. J Med Genet 2016, Haer-Wigman L et al. Eur J Hum Genet.2017). Additional analysis methods were used (Sanger, MLPA, array-CGH) in 6 cases. Results: Potentially pathogenic mutations were detected in 45 retinal (6/13) and 81.6% (71/87) for the 105 and 287 gene panels, respectively. These mutation rates were achieved using complementary methods in 6 cases. Finaldiagnoses included retinitis pigmentosa, Usher syndrome, cone-rod dystrophy rare cases of Knobloch and Oliver-McFarlane syn-dromes due to mutations in the COL18A1 and PNPLA6 genes, respectively. Conclusions: This is the rst systematic investigation of the molecular identity of 100 Greek patients with various subforms of IRDs by NGS and complementary methods leading to an overall mutation rate of 77%. A plethora ofnovel mutations was documented further expanding the genetic heterogeneity. The molecular identi cation estab- lished the complete diagnosis of the patients thuscontributing to family making decision, prognosis and candidacy to current and future treatments. S.

Zinchenko A. Vasilyeva, V. V. Kadyshev, A. V. Marakhonov Research Center for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) refers to a heterogeneous group of inherited ocular diseases that result in a progressive ret-inal degeneration affecting 1 in 3,000 to 5,000 people. To date, more than 80 genetic forms of RP are described. Here we perform genetic analysis of the two-generation familywith 5 affected members with the terminal severe stage of RP. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of one of the patients revealed two candidate variants. The rst one is pathogenic variant in the exon 16 of SNRNP200 gene (chr2:96958829G>A), leading to the missense (p.Arg681Cys, NM_014014.4) the heterozygous state.Mutations in the SNRNP200 gene in heterozygous state were described in patients with RP33 (OMIM 610359). The second variant is a novel single nucleotide variant in exon 1of the PRPH2 gene (p.Val28Met, NM_000322.4) in a204 J. del Picchiaheterozygous state. in PRPH2 gene in het- erozygous, compound heterozygous and homozygous states were described analysis revealed SNRNP200 to be co-segregated with the disease while PRPH2 variant was not found in 2 out of 5 patients. Nevertheless, it could make an impact on the clinical presentation by aggravationof clinical picture in patients bearing two variants.

Pre-synaptic disorders, characterized by as cone-rod can be mis- taken for Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Full- eld electroretinogram is crucial for the differential diagnosis,but it can be dif cult to perform in young children. Here, we report (i) the identi cation of biallelic mutations in the RIMS2 gene encoding a pre-synaptic protein not yet asso- ciated with human diseases in 3/4 families initially referred for LCA and (ii) the diagnostic adjustment to CRSD with variable associated alteration including autistic behaviorand insulinopathy. Methods: Exome sequencing combined with targeted RIMS2 testing were performed in 46 prescreened patients with CRSD and 94 with LCA. Biallelic performed onhuman retina, brain and pancreas. Nonsense variants were functionally investigated in mammalian cells. Results: Biallelic RIMS2 sequence variants were found in four unrelated families. RIMS2, a protein regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis localizes in the human retinal outer plexiform layer, Purkinje cells and pancreaticislets. Apart from CRSD, neurodevelopmental disease was observed in all cases, and abnormal glucose homeostasis in the eldest patient. Nonsense variants lead to truncatedRIMS2 and decreased insulin secretion in mammalian cells. Conclusions: This is the rst report of syndromic CRSD with neurodevelopmental or pancreatic involvement due toRIMS2 loss-of-function.

Whole exome sequencing (WES)is a method that allows an ef cient analysis of all known genes associated with hereditary hearing loss. Aim: Using WES to identify new genetic causes of hearing impairment in the Caucasian and Roma populations in Slovakia, where standard genetic tests performed so far have not elucidated the etiology of deafness. Patients and methods : We collected 1,369 individuals from 870 families with bilateral SNHL. The previous analysis revealed that 30% of the families have mutations inthe DFNB1 locus. From the DFNB1 negative patients we selected 52 families, 42 of Caucasian and 10 of Roma ethnicity, for WES. Results : Using WES, we identi ed the genetic etiology in 22 probands of Caucasian ethnicity and in 1 proband of Roma ethnicity. The detected variants and 11 likely pathogenic variants responsible for hearing impairment. 16 variants have not yet been described in the literature. In one Roma family thecausal variants were found in two genes ( PTPRQ and MYO15A ) in one individual. Conclusion : Using WES, we detected the genetic etiology of hearing impairment in 52% probands of Caucasian ethnicity and 10% of Roma probands. WES dramatically increases the detection of pathogenic variantsin known genes associated with HL. Supported by: VEGA 1/0214/16, 15-067 Z. S. None. I. Masindova: None. D. Danis: None. L. Langova:None.

Ophthalmology Basel (IOB), Basel, Switzerland, Basel, Switzerland Introduction: ABCA4 is the most mutated gene in inherited retinal dystrophies. A genotype-phenotype correlation model was described in 1999 with few cases reported. Here,we de ne genotype-phenotype correlations in the largest cohort study worldwide of patients: 434 with Stargardt disease (STGD1) and (CRD),all carrying Next Genera- tion Sequencing technologies. Medical history and ophthal-mological data were obtained for 372 patients. Genotype- phenotype correlation studies were carried out for the following variables: variant type, age at onset of symptoms(AO), and clinical phenotype (STGD1 or and 6.5% of our cohort; these cases had a signi cantly earlier AO than patients carrying two mutations, one of which is a missense variant. CRDpatients presented earlier AO than STGD1 patients. Conclusions: Our study, conducted in the largest ABCA4 -associated disease cohort reported to date, supports the genotype-phenotype model established for ABCA4 variants, and broadens the mutational spectrum of the gene. ABCA4 truncating variants were mostly associated with earlier AO and a CRD phenotype. According to our observations, ABCA4 patients presenting with two truncating variants may rst present features of STGD1 but eventually develop rod dysfunction, underscoring the importance of an accurate genetic diagnosis.206 J. del PicchiaGrants: Instituto Miguel Servet Program (CP12/03256) from ISCIII M. del Pozo-Valero: None.

Patients with biallelic missense variants in RCBTB1 display diverse IRD phenotypes such as retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we tested the hypothesis that RCBTB1 is involved in NRF2-regulated protection against reactive oxygen species in the eye, morespecically in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Materials and Methods: AXenopus tropicalis rcbtb1 / knockout (KO) was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 editing. Histology and three-dimensional electron microscopy was performed on of RNA-seq analysis was performed on RCBTB1 -mutated patients 'lymphocytes, treated with H 2O2, as well as on embryos from the rcbtb1 /KOs treated with CdCl 2.A n RCBTB1 knockdown cell generated in cells and functional assays(flow cytometry, MTT-assay, cell the consequences of RCBTB1 loss-of-function.Results: Rcbtb1 /animals showed changes in the RPE, similar to observations in human cases, including loss of apical-basal cell polarity, cuboidal cell morphology, spreading of the pigment granules and vacuolisation. NRF2 downstream targets and several metallothioneins were found to be differentially expressed, both in the KOand cellular models. Functional assays in ARPE-19 cells revealed that RCBTB1 depletion affects cellular responses to external insults of oxidative stress.

P03 Internal Organs & Endocrinology (Lung, Kidney, Liver, Gastrointestinal) P03.01.A A cost effective experience in diagnosis of autosomal- dominant polycystic disease by custom-target NGS panel in a reference center . J. ADPKD is the most common inherited kidney disease that is caused by mutations in the PKD1 /PKD2 . Most mutations take place in PKD1 . Its molecular diagnosis is a challenge by the high allelic heterogeneity and overlap of pseudo-genes between 1-32 exons. So far, there are few data on PKD1 /PKD2 variants in the Spanish population. The main objective of this study has been to establish and know themutations in ADPKD in our cohort. Mutational analysis of both PKD1 and PKD2 was performed on 158 unrelated families, by NGS using a custom exon-target panel frominherited nephropathies, Nephroseq \u00ae. and Sanger sequencing were performedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 207onPKD1 or PCR, and Sanger sequencing for PKD2 .I n addition, MLPA was used to rule out CNVs. SNVs were identi ed in 122 families (77.23%): 96 families in PKD1 (78.7%) and 26 families in PKD2 (22.3%). Globally: 64 frameshift and nonsense; 11 splicing, 36 8 in frame ins/del, and 4 large-deletions). Overall, 15% of var-iants were de novo and 50% were not previously described. This study demonstrates that NGS is a cost-effective experimental approach for simultaneous analysis of thePKD1 and PKD2 . The analysis of mutations in the ADPKD-Spanish population expands the understanding of the genetic diversity of the different ethnic groups, enrichesthe databases with the new mutations, and contributes to their genetic counselling. As well as, reproductive (six pregnancies were currently successful) and/or therapeuticdecision-making (a signi cant number of patients with highly pathogenic variants are currently under treatment with Tolvaptan).

P03.04.A Clinical and molecular characteristics of young Russian patients with homo- and heterozygous AIRE mutations E. N. Suspitsin 1,2, L. V. Ditkovskaya1, T. V. Gabrusskaya1, N. B. Ulanova1, D. L. Strekalov1, M. N. Guseva1 1St.-Petersburg State Pediatric Medical University, St.- Petersburg, Russian Federation,2N.N. Petrov Institute of Oncology, St.-Petersburg, Russian Federation Introduction: Hereditary defects of the AIRE gene are associated with a rare autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome (APECED). The disorder has been found in many populations world- wide. The clinical manifestations are quite variable evenwithin families, but major features include hypoparathyr- oidism, Addison disease, and mucocutaneous candidiasis. Although the condition usually follows autosomal-recessiveinheritance there is an increasing body of evidence that some cases may be caused by monoallelic gain-of-function (GOF) mutations. Materials and methods: 10 Russian patients (age 3-18 years) were subjected to the AIRE gene analysis. Of those, 5 had clinical signs of APECED syndrome suspected byimmunologist, gastroenterologist or endocrinologist. In these patients Sanger sequencing of AIRE was performed. Another 5 patients underwent targeted sequencing ofprimary immunode ciency (PID) genes including AIRE because of suspected PID condition.Results: 6 patients had biallelic AIRE mutations with the common c.769C>T (p.R257*) allele being detected in 4 individuals. One patient was homozygous for c.173C>T (p. A58V) variant recently described in Russian patients (Orlova et al, 2017). Rare c.32T>C (p.L11P) mutation was reported in Russian population for the rst time. All monoallelic mutations ( n=4) were represented by the c.901G>A (p.V301M) allele. This variant altering func- tional properties of the protein was once reported in aRussian female with late-onset classical APECED (Oftedal et al, 2015). Conclusions: Our study indicates that some GOF variants of AIRE are common in young Russian patients with manifestations of autoimmune disease. This work was supported by RFBR grant 17-29-06069E.N. Genetic and molecular analysis of urinary magnesium concentration in Scottish and Croatian populations C. B. Joseph 1, C. M. Stanton1, C. Drake1, T. S.

Renal magnesium handling plays an important role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis, however the exact biologicalmechanisms remain unclear. A recent genome-wide asso- ciation study concentration (uMg) variants in theARL15 gene on chromosome 5. ARL15 encodes a GTP- binding protein that regulates the magnesium transporter channel TRPM6, and other proteins involved in magnesiumhomeostasis in physiologically relevant cell lines. We conducted meta-analyses for urinary magnesium in 11, 617 individuals from Scottish and Croatian populations todetermine possible genes involved in these traits. Mass spectrometry analysis was conducted to determine inter- actors of Arl15 and in-vitro knockout models of Arl15 wasestablished using CRISPR-Cas9. The top SNP associated with uMg in our meta-analyses lies within a transcription208 J. del Picchiafactor binding site in an enhancer region of ARL15. Indi- viduals homozygous of rs35931 has lower urinary magnesium levels compared to with the homozygous reference allele. Arl15 interacts with magnesium transporters within the distal convoluted tubule segment of the kidneys. Furthermore, we nd that homo- zygous deletion of Arl15 is lethal at the organismal level. We hypothesise that the variant found affects the expression of ARL15, which, in turn modulates magnesium transportby regulating magnesium transporters. We are performing further functional studies to elucidate the role ARL15 plays in magnesium homeostasis both in vitro and O. T. C. in monochorionic dizygotic twins (MCDZT) identi ed at molecular genetic testing of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus B.

Here we report the rst case of blood chimerism in MCDZT detected as an additional nding at molecular genetic testing. Dizygotic twin brothers wereborn to a female couple after assisted reproduction (IVF, in vitro fertilization). One presented with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Molecular genetic analysis identi ed a heterozygous pathogenic variant within the insulin gene ( INS, dominant inheritance). Interestingly, the donor of the oocytes for IVF had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as an infant.Screening for the INSvariant in her blood DNA was positive and altered the diagnosis to permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Testing of the unaffected brother for the INSvariant surprisingly showed that he also carried the INSvariant in blood DNA but not in DNA from buccal membrane cells. Additional microsatellite studies con rmed blood chimerism in both twins but ruled out chimerism in buccal membrane cells. Whether our ndings should be classi ed as con nedblood chimerism which is relatively common, or as an exceedingly rare reported tissue chimerism has to be eluci- dated by studies of other tissues. B.

Inserm, EFS, Service de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique M\u00e9dicale et de Biologie de Reproduction, enterology and Beaujon Hospital, Toulouse, France Until very recently, variants in the so far reported chronic pancreatitis (CP) genes such as PRSS1 have been found to cause/predispose to the disease through increasing trypsinactivity or eliciting endoplasmic reticulum stress. In January 2020, an international collaboration reported association of functionally de cient variants in the TRPV6 gene with CP, identifying a novel mechanism of pancreatitis due to Ca 2+ dysregulation. This discovery was made essentially by ana- lyzing young patients with idiopathic CP. for autosomal CP remains unknown. Herein, we analyzed the TRPV6 gene in probands of 235 such families by NGS. All families had atleast two affected members and had remained genetically unexplained prior to the current analysis. We identi ed 11 ultra-rare variants (all were absent in 570 French controls andhad an allele frequency of 0-0.000008 in gnomAD) in 11 families. Of the 11 variants, 5 were previously reported to beAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 209pathogenic. All the remaining six variants were novel, com- prising a clear loss-of-function variant, a single amino acid deletion variant, and four missense variants. All these four missense variants were predicted to be of pathogenic rele- vance by Polyphen and/or SIFT and had a CADD score comparable to known pathogenic missense variants. identi ed ultra-rare TRPV6 ~5% of the studied families. This establishes TRPV6 as a relatively fre- quent autosomal dominant CP gene for which genetic testingis warranted. Our results also suggest that haploinsuf ciency of the TRPV6 gene is suf cient to cause CP. (Work supported by INSERM). E. Masson: None. J.M. Chen: None. V. Rebours: None. M. Le Rhun: None. H.

Kurth Institute of Human Genetics, Germany Undine syndrome, a congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), derives its name from the legend of the water nymph Ondine/Undine who punished her mortal husband for his unfaithfulness with a curse of stoppingbreathing and dying when he fell asleep. Normally, increasing CO 2blood levels induce the hypercapnic re flex which accelerates breathing via specialized neurons of thepre-B\u00f6tzinger complex in the ventral hindbrain. Polyalanine expansions in PHOX2B and rarely other genes have been described to cause genetic forms of CCHS by disturbing thebreathing re flex. Recently, a homozygous mutation in the homeodomain transcription factor LBX1 was reported in two brothers with neonatal hypoventilation and complexautonomic symptoms. The mutation affects the C-terminus of the protein and impairs cooperativity with PHOX2B, without disrupting the DNA-binding domain. We herereport a female patient with severe hypoventilation who required continuous mechanical ventilation immediately after birth. During her rst 11 years of life she was supplied with a tracheostomy and mask ventilation at night because of episodes of apnea. In childhood, she had severe con- stipation and, developed a paralytic ileus like Hirschsprungdisease. Since the age of 11 she used a respiratory mask for sleeping and showed normocapnia.

P03.13.A Deletion and duplication: unusual case of diagnostics for patient with cystic and Child \", Yekaterinburg, Russian Federation,2Federal State Auton- omous Educational Institution of Higher Education \u00abUralFederal University named after the rst President of Russia B.N. Yeltsin, Yekaterinburg, Russian Federation Background: Cystic brosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease mutation in the CFTR (cystic brosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. Newbornscreening for CF was introduced in the Russian Federation in 2006. The incidence of CF varies among different regions, in Sverdlovsk region it is 1: 9,500. The vastmajority of recurrent CFTR variants are point mutations, but several populations have larger deletions and duplications, involving one or more complete exons. Here we want toreport a case of CF with simultaneously existing deletion and duplication of different regions of 11 exon CFTR . Case presentation: The patient (a 1-month-old girl) was born at term to non-consanguineous parents. For newborn 's diagnostics CF we use a three-step IRT/IRT1 /DNA algorithm. Our patient had elevated both times (328.6 ng/ml and 299.8 ng/ ml respectively). Moreover, the girl had pathological sweat chlorides - 110 mmol/L. Results: The trio genetic sequencing of the CFTR gene showed heterozygous delF508 mutation in exon 11 for the child and her father. For searching another variant we weredone Multiplex Ligation-mediated Probe Ampli cation (MLPA) of We have found heterozygous deletion of exon 9 for the girl and her mother and have provedthe deletion F508 for father, but this analysis has shown also duplication of exon 11 and 2 copies F508 for proband. Conclusions: We assume the proband has 3 copies of exon 11: two normal and one with del508F, and it is the defect copy, that is crucial for protein synthesis. S. Deryabina: None. O. Lagutina: None.

Phylactou3, Yiallouros1,5 1Medical School, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus, 2Institute of Anatomy, University of Bern, Bern, Switzer- land,3Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Makarios III Hospital, Nicosia, Cyprus Introduction: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of CFTR mutations in the cystic brosis population in Cyprus with particular emphasis on the endemic L346P (p.Leu346Pro) cases and a novel case which bears the poorly described CFTRdup2 inhomozygosity. Materials and Methods: The national cystic brosis patients 'registry in Cyprus was searched for the demo- graphic, diagnostic, and genotypic data of all cases whose diagnosis was genetically con rmed via the identi cation of two mutant CFTR alleles. In all cases, genotyping was doneby Sanger sequencing for the detection of common mutations and was followed by next-generation sequencing for the identi cation of uncommon mutations. Results: From an overall of 47 cases, the most common mutation was p.Phe508del with an allelic frequency of 46.9%, which is compatible with its northwest-to-southeastdecreasing frequency gradient in Europe. Most mutations were classi ed as CFTR protein processing (class II, 50%) or conductance (class IV, 12.3%) defects. Multiple muta-tions were detected in 3 cases. Seven patients with mild clinical manifestations, mostly presenting with dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalance, carried p.Leu346Pro (7.1%), aclass IV mutation detected solely in individuals of Cypriot descent. A novel case of a patient homozygous for the CFTRdup2 mutation was associated with a severe pheno-type with hepatic involvement, biliary cirrhosis and eventually hepatic failure leading to death. Conclusions: The small population of cystic brosis patients in Cyprus follows the regional genotypic trends, although several cases bear unique mutational pro les, which contribute to the wide genotypic and phenotypicspectrum of the disease.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have indicated that SNP clusters in the immediate promoterregion and far upstream of SLC6A14 modify meconium ileus (MI) occurrence at birth and progressive lung disease, respectively. SLC6A14 is a sodium- and chloride-dependent neutral and cationic amino acid transporter that is expressed in several tissues including lung and pancreatic duct. Materials and Methods: We are using public data and in vitro transcriptional reporter studies to understand how theSLC6A14 promoter and upstream SNPs contribute to modication of CF. Results: Colocalizing SLC6A14 promoter SNPs with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of multiple organs from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) suggests that thepancreas drives MI susceptibility and indicates that the eQTL effect is driven primarily by males. Reporter assays in the CFPAC-1 pancreas cell line with a 2.4kb segmentcontaining MI-associated SNPs display increased gene expression with the risk haplotypes, and exhibit transrepres- sion with a steroid hormone receptor. The core promoteractivity and haplotype effects were also evident in the lung cell lines Calu-3 and HBE. Analyses of ReMap and JASPAR databases pinpoint a series of transcriptionbinding elements in the upstream region for ongoing investigations to understand how these segments crosstalk with the core promoter of SLC6A14 in the lung. Conclusions: Our studies implicate differences in gene regulation of SLC6A14 in the lung versus the pancreas, with increased expression level being detrimental to CFphenotypes in both organs. M.

Thus, the clinical diagnosis is often difcult to be made. The aim of our study was to test the ability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to improve thediagnosis precision in a heterogeneous group of children with clinically suspected cystic kidney diseases. Materials and Methods: Next-generation sequencing of genes responsible for the formation of cystic kidneys was performed in 32 unrelated patients with various clinically diagnosed cystic kidney diseases without a de nitive genetic diagnosis. Results: The underlying pathogenic variants were detected in 69% of patients ( n=22). The result of NGS correlated with the clinical diagnosis made before the NGS in 53% of patients ( n=17), in the remaining 15 children (47%) the result of NGS revealed another type of cystickidney disease than clinically suspected or did not nd any causal mutation. The most common unexpected ndings were variants in nephronophthisis (NPHP) genes polycystic kidney disease ( n=4). Overall, we found 25 (probably) pathogenic variants in the PKHD1 gene, 8 variants in theTMEM67 gene, 4 variants in the PKD1 gene, 2 variants in the HNF1B gene and 2 variants in BBS1 and NPHP1 genes, respectively. Conclusions: NGS is a valuable tool in the diagnostics of various forms of cystic kidney diseases. Its results changed the clinically based diagnoses in 15% of the children.

P03.18.C Circulating miRNA as a predictive biomarker of type 2 diabetes in prediabetic patients-outcomes of 5-year prospective observational study I. PolandIntroduction: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) remains the most prevalent form of diabetes. The detection of cur-rent T2DM diagnostic markers is generally late and occurs when displaying metabolic imbalance thus, novel bio- markers that could be useful as a new tool for predicting theprogression from prediabetes to T2DM are needed. The goal of this study was to conduct a baseline comparison of serum-circulating miRNA in prediabetic individuals withdistinction between those who later progressed to T2DM and those who did not. Materials and methods: The study group was divided - patients with newly diagnosed T2DM over 5 year observational period ( n=18) and control group ( n=12) with no known of dysglycemia. The expressionlevel of 798 miRNAs in serum samples using the Nano- String technology was examined. Results: The study revealed that 18 miRNAs were deregulated in serum samples of patients who developed T2DM after 5 years versus non T2DM patients. Pathway analysis showed that miRNA target genes were mainlysignicantly enriched in homeostasis, neuronal signaling, protein complex oligomerization and core matrisome. ROC analysis demonstrated that miR-491-5p, miR-1307-3p,miR-298 and miR-1290 can be introduced as a diagnostic tool for the prediction of T2DM (AUC =0.940; 0.894; 0.877; 0.722, respectively). Conclusions: The results suggest that circulating miR- NAs could potentially be used as predictive biomarkers of T2DM in prediabetic patients. I. Sidorkiewicz: None. M. Niemira: None.

University Hospital, Otto- von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany,2Swabian Children 's Cancer Center, University Children 's Hospital, Augsburg, Germany,3Praxis f\u00fcr Humangenetik, Augsburg, Germany Introduction: DICER1 syndrome (MIM 601200) is a rare tumor predisposition syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance usually manifesting in childhood and adoles-cence. Tumor development follows Knudson 's two-hit model involving the gene DICER1 located on chromo- some 14q32.13. Predisposing germline pathogenic variants(rst hit) are mainly Tumor-related driver mutations are speci c hot-spot mis- sense mutations in trans (second hit) located in the RNAse IIIb domain of the DICER1 protein. Patients: We report on a female child with cystic nephroma of the right kidney and developmental delay atage 1 year. Facial features included frontal bossing, flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism and small mouth with thin lips. Body measurements were unremarkable. Her mother wasreported with Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT) and multi- nodular goiter at age 12 to 16 years. Clinical presentation of mother and child suggested familial inheritance ofDICER1 syndrome. Results: No typical DICER1 loss-of-function germline mutation was detected in the child by standard Sangersequencing. The child 's tumor tissue of the right kidney revealed DICER1 hot-spot mutation c.5437G>A p. Glu1813Lys. Subsequent molecular karyotyping of blood of the child using Affymetrix CytoScan HD SNP-Array showed a 2.31MB interstitial contiguous gene in 14q32 (arr[hg19] 14q32.12q32.13(93835222_96155830)x1). The interval harbors 23 OMIM-listed genes including DICER1 . The array result wasnally con rmed in the blood of child and mother by MLPA. Conclusions: Patients with DICER1 syndrome and germline 14q32 contiguous gene deletions infrequentlyhave been detected. In the few patients reported to date various deletion intervals were identi ed suggesting no consistent chromosomal breakpoints. I. Wieland: None. I. Schanze: None. A. Gnekow: None. M. Kuhlen: None.

Karaman 1, a aran1, Z. Uyguner1 1Department of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey,2Depart- ment of Pediatric Endocrinology, Istanbul Faculty ofMedicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Gonadotropin-dependent or central pre- cocious puberty (CPP) is caused by premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. There are several genes playing roles in this pathway and two of themare maternally imprinted; 1) MKRN3 gene, located at 15q11.2, upstream suppressor of HPG axis, 2) DLK1 gene, located at 14q32, affecting kisspeptin signaling pathwayhence important role for regulating pubertal timing. Materials and Methods: Coding regions of the MKRN3 (NM_005664.3) and DLK1 (NM_003836.6) genes were Sanger sequenced in 17 patients (15 female, 2 male). In presence of pathogenic variant, segregation analysis were performed in families. Results: We identi ed two novel heterozygous variants in two unrelated cases in DLK1 gene. The rst variant was in exon 4 (c.357C>G (p.Tyr119Ter)) and the second was inintron 1 (c.67 +78C>T), both were classi ed under probably pathogenic by in silico analysis. Segregation analysis presented the paternal inheritance of both, complying withthe inheritance model of the genes. No pathogenic variant identi ed in MKRN3 gene in our cases. Conclusions: Previously, three small and one gross deletions of DLK1 were associated with CPP. Nonsense and splicing variant have rst time presented in our study. The alteration identi ed in intron one needs further investigation on transcript level to show whether it causes splicing defect. Nevertheless, inheritance pattern complies with imprinted gene model of DLK1 . These results suggest that investiga- tion of DLK1 gene may contribute to the elucidation of the genetic assosiation of familial CPP.

Underlying cause is frequently dysfunction of motile cilia causing Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia or non-ciliary causes. Inaddition to randomization of the left right body axis, PCD is characterized by frequent respiratory infections and infertility. Methods: We used Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to delineate the underlying molecular cause in 37 mainly consanguineous families with laterality defects. Results: We identi ed causative variants in 32% with majority of mutations detected in genes previously associated with PCD, including 2 small homozygousCNVs. Variants in non PCD genes, PKD1l1 and GJA1 were also detected. We further identi ed homozygous null mutations in two genes not previously associated withhuman disease, MNS1 andDNAH9 , both in cases with situs inversus but little or no respiratory symptoms. Gene matcher database revealed two additional families withbiallelic DNAH9 mutation and immuno fluorescence analy- sis revealed complete absence of DNAH9 from respiratory cilia of one affected while DNAH9 localises to the distalhalf of cilia in controls. Further, we found direct interaction of DNAH9 with the ODA docking complex protein CCDC114 using Y2H screening also interaction withDNAH5 and DNAI2 using co-Immunoprecipitation. Conclusions: We could only solve a third of the laterality cases genetically using WES, pointing towards non codingvariations, genetic mosaicism or epigenetic effects while we were able to identify two novel human disease causing genes, MNS1 andDNAH9 , both causing laterality defects with no or little respiratory disease.ERC: TreatCilia D.

A number of plasma proteins have been found to be associated with renal phe- notypes, but prior studies have been limited by smaller sample sizes and fewer proteins. Moreover, the causalmechanisms underlying these associations have not been investigated. Methods: We conducted the largest observational study of plasma proteins and renal function in terms of sample size (up to N =5,285 across four studies: KORA, INTER- VAL, HUNT, QMDiab) and number of proteins (k =1,100). Associations with eGFR and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were tested using regression models in a trans-ethnic discovery-replication approach. We further examined thecausal nature of these associations using two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization. Results: 57 proteins were found to be consistently associated with eGFR in population samples of European and admixed ancestry; of these, 18 were associated with CKD. Many well-known biomarkers of renal function (e.g.cystatin-C) were identi ed, as were JAM-B and contactin-4 as novel biomarkers. The strongest evidence of causality was observed in the positive effect of eGFR on testican-2(p=2.84E-04), a nding consistent with the biological role of testican-2 in glomeruli remodeling and kidney injury repair. Conclusions: Our study uncovers novel plasma proteo- mic biomarkers for renal function and presents evidence for selected causal relationships. Plasma levels of testican-2 arereflective of mechanisms underlying progressive renal function loss, thus suggesting its applicability as a biomarker of early renal dysfunction and disease progres-sion in the general population.

P03.25.A Gain-of-function variant of the calcium-sensing receptor gene is associated with longer survival on renalreplacement therapy in Caucasian patients H. M. Rothe 1,2, S. C. Nephrology, University Hospital, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, 4Medical University Innsbruck, Department of Internal Medicine IV, Nephrology and Hypertension, Innsbruck, Austria Introduction: Patients with end-stage kidney disease require renal replacement therapy, i.e. dialysis or kidney transplantation, for survival. Here we report for the rst time a genetic variant which is associated with longer sur- vival on renal replacement therapy in Caucasian patients. Materials and Methods: We conducted a survival analysis of three European end-stage kidney disease patient populations in Austria and Bavaria. 198 patients (118 male, 80 female) were genotyped for three variants of thecalcium-sensing receptor gene after signing the consent form. The study started in 2005 and survival analysis was performed in 2018. During these years all patients receivedcare according to the standards of the Austrian and German societies of nephrology. Results: Survival on renal replacement therapy was signicantly different (age and sex adjusted Cox regression p=0.04) between carriers of the glycine and arginine alleles at position 990 of the calcium-sensing receptor molecule(rs1042636.) The two rs1042636 cohorts AA (two arginine alleles) and GA/GG (at least one glycine allele) were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium with a minor allelefrequency of 7%. Conclusions: The glycine variant of rs1042636 calcium- sensing receptor molecules has been shown to result in again-of-function, as compared with the arginine variant, in cell culture studies with transfected human embryonic kidney cells. It was also associated with lower baselineparathyroid hormone levels in the Caucasian patient cohort of the Evaluation of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events (EVOLVE) trial. Our studyshows that it is associated with longer survival on renal replacement therapy in Caucasian patients. H.M. Rothe: None. S. Komolka: None. C. Wanner: None. G. Mayer: None.

Approxi-mately 18% of patients have additional anatomical mal- formations or associated neurodevelopmental disorders (HSCR-complex). We hypothesized that genes affected byrare Copy Number Variants contribute to disease develop- ment in \"HSCR-complex \"patients. Indeed, we could con- rm that Copy Number (CN) losses ( n=11) are enriched in these patients ( n=23), if no other causal variant was identi ed (p=3.64E 7). At least ve patients had a large de novo CNV (3 losses, 2 gains). The identi ed rare CN losses are enriched for variant intolerant genes, overexpressed in the developing mouse enteric variant in TUBB was identi ed in a HSCR patient without a deleterious CNV, and AKT3 as well as UFD1L are impacted by CN losses in other patients. The contribution of the known HSCR predisposing risk haplotypes was comparable between patients with a pathogenic coding variant andcontrols (P =0.826). All other HSCR subgroups differed signicantly with controls and between each subgroup (P=0.02 or lower), patients with isolated HSCR and with- out a RET coding variant had the highest burden, unaffected controls the lowest. Our zebra sh model reveals that dis- ruption of six of these 9 genes - alone or via epistasis withret-results in a HSCR phenotype. This con rms the epi- static effect of losing a copy of a gene regulating enteric nervous system development with the predisposed down-regulation of RET expression. L. Kuil: None. C.S. J.D.

The aim of this study was to identify genetic causes in a cohort of children and adolescents with FSGS. Material and Methods: 35 unrelated individuals with disease onset <18 years of age and suspected hereditary FSGS were analyzed using exome sequencing. Suspectedhereditary FSGS was de ned if at least one of the following criteria was present: absence of a secondary cause, <18 years of age, kidney biopsy with suspicion of a hereditarycause, extrarenal manifestations, and/or positive familial history/consanguinity. Variants were to the ACMG classi cation. The clinical phenotype was assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Results: In seven patients, (likely) pathogenic variants according to ACMG were identi ed in known disease- causing genes (diagnostic yield: 20%). ,TRPC6 ) had to be classi ed as VUS (Table 1). Conclusions: The diagnostic yield of 20% highlights the importance of genetic testing in patients <18 years of age with nephrotic syndrome. Early genetic diagnosis couldallow a personalized treatment approach with weaning of unnecessary immunosuppressive treatment, avoidance of renal biopsies and provision of well-informed geneticcounselling.216 J. del paternal; VUS, of None.

However, not all BMPR2 mutation carriers develop the disease, highlighting the presence of reduced penetrance. In order to identify geno- mic regions that could be contributing to incompletepenetrance, high-throughput genotyping arrays and next generation sequencing were conducted in an hPAH family. The family comprises 65 Spanish individuals spanning ve different generations. One BMPR2 mutation (c.1472G> A; p.Arg491Gln) was identi ed in 22 members, but only 9 of them developed the disease. The SNP arrays analysis wasperformed in 33 family members and we identi ed a genomic region in 2q24.3, located at 38 Mb from the BMPR2 gene, which could contribute to increase the sus- ceptibility of pulmonary hypertension in mutation carriers (Puigdevall et al., J Med Genet, 2019). Several genetic association studies have identi ed variants in this region associated with phenotypes involved in cardiovascular pathology, such as hypertension or ischemic cardiomyo- pathy, which could be related to some of the symptoms ofpulmonary hypertension. In order to identify the speci c variant/s that may act as genetic modi ers of hPAH within the candidate region, we have performed whole-genomesequencing in 16 BMPR2 mutation carriers: 6 affected individuals and 7 asymptomatic carriers. The identi cation of a possible genetic modi er in this family will allow us to advance in our understanding of reduced penetrance in None. I. Blanco: None. J. Barber\u00e0: None. C. Badenas: None.

Six patients carried a likely pathogenic novel variant(p.G83D p.R295C, c.-67C>T, c.1207-1G>A, p. M532V). A functional analysis for c.-67C>T indicatedreduced activity in Caco2 and Mcf7 cells. Nine cases showed the whole HNF1B gene deletion (de novo in ve patients). The median age of diagnosis was 19 (SNVs) and6 (deletion) years old, respectively. Clinical presentation included earlier onset in deleted patients (median 6 vs 19 years) and different spatial cysts localization (cortical forSNVs and medullary in at least 3 deleted cases). Diabetes was present in six patients only, possibly due to the young age of many cases involved. Two patients with urogenitalmalformation and 3 with cholestasis were identi ed. A 21- year-old woman had mild developmental delay: additional array-CGH was performed and a large (1.3 Mb) deletionwas found. Contrary, a 29-years-old man homozygous for p.G83D did not show intellectual disability. In conclusion, the patients with SNVs developed a milder phenotype thanthose deleted, and the molecular defects were frequently of de novo origin. We con rm the wide phenotypic hetero- geneity of HNF1B-related disorders and we point out thatliver disease can be a major complication. C.P. Cristalli: None. A. Mattiaccio: None. C.

P03.33.C Impact of common genetic risk variants on familial aggregation of in flammatory bowel disease Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,4KU leuven, Leuven, Belgium Family history is the strongest risk factor for in flammatory bowel disease (IBD). The contribution of common genetic variants to familial aggregation in multiple-affected IBDfamilies, however, remains included 54 multiple-affected families ( 3rst-degree relatives affec- ted), including 189 affected (IBD), and 133 unaffected rst- degree relatives; as well as 1768 sporadic cases and 868 unrelated non-IBD controls. For all individuals,Immunochip genotypes were available. Weighted polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated using PRSice-2.0 across different p-value thresholds (pTs), and compared between groups. The association between PRS and familial IBD was further evaluated in age- and sex-adjusted generalized mixed regression models including family id as randomeffect. Using pT =0.05, the affected relatives had a higher PRS than unaffected relatives (P =1.0x10 02), sporadic cases (P =4.6x1002), and non-IBD controls (P < 2.2x 1016). The risk of IBD in families increased by 1.23-fold for every incremental standard deviation in PRS. However, the proportion of the explained variance between affectedand unaffected family members was smaller than that between sporadic IBD and non-IBD controls (5% versus 17%, respectively). Of note, in familial IBD, varianceexplained by the PRS dropped dramatically for pT>0.01. A plausible hypothesis is that while familial cases differ from sporadic cases in low-risk (high p-value) variants, familial cases differ from their unaffected relatives mostly in high- risk (low p-value) variants. Higher PRS increases the risk for familial IBD as it does for sporadic IBD. The proportionof the explained variance in families however is limited, because of shared genetic background between family members. BIRD Grant H. Lee: None. L. Hannes: None. M. Vancamelbeke: None.

Severity is variable, from benign idio- pathic neonatal hepatitis to intrahepatic cholestasis leadingto liver failure and transplant. There are several genes described for different genetic diseases that lead to choles- tasis. USP53 has been recently suggested as a candidate gene for paediatric intrahepatic cholestasis based on one family with two affected siblings. Interestingly, USP53 interacts with tight junction protein 2 ( TJP2 ) for which pathogenic variants are known to cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. To date, the USP53 gene has not been linked to an OMIM phenotype. By combining exome/genome sequencing and mining our in-house variant data- base we identi edve patients from unrelated families. All affected individuals display a similar phenotype, mainlyincluding early onset intrahepatic cholestasis. Moreover, one family showed hearing loss as an additional phenotype. All patients were homozygotes for different loss-of-functionvariants in the USP53 gene. USP53 (ubiquitin speci c peptidase 53) is a tight junction-associated protein that is known to involve in the survival of auditory hair cells andhearing. Our results con rmUSP53 as a novel gene for autosomal recessive intrahepatic cholestasis. Additionally, we demonstrate that combined exome/genome sequencingand variant database mining is an effective approach to discover and con rm novel genes related to human diseases. This accelerate the process of gene discovery and ultimatelyshortens the diagnostic odyssey in rare genetic disorders. S. Alawbathani: A.

The serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 has earlier been implicated in IBS. Material and Methods: We sequenced the alternative promoter P2 that primarily drives SLC6A4 expression in the gut and analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)for association with IBS. We also assessed their functional relevance by gene reporter assays, in silico analysis and comparative expression studies. In addition, we correlateddetected SNPs with expression data and IBS symptoms. Results: Detected SNPs were linked in different haplo- types and tagging SNP rs2020938 associated withfemale IBS with constipation (IBS-C) in a discovery sample comprising 287 individuals. Subsequent validation and meta-analysis of rs2020938 in 2175 IBS patients and 6128controls from eight countries con rmed the association with female IBS-C. Expression data obtained from different intestinal regions showed that the alternative promoterdrives SERT expression primarily in the small intestine. Additionally, gene reporter assays pointed to a functional impact of the SNPs within this region. In silico analysesindicated differential expression regulation by transcription factors that have previously been implicated in GI disorders. Further follow up in tissue samples and clinical data fromIBS patients and controls revealed that rs2020938 correlates with differential expression in the jejunum and stool consistency. Conclusions: Our results indicate differential expression regulation driven by a functionally relevant polymorphic promoter in female IBS-C and consolidates the importanceofSLC6A4 in IBS pathogenesis.

P03.36.C Application of NGS sequencing for improved diagnosis in the pediatric nephrology setting O. Beltcheva1, K. Kamenarova1, 1Molecular Center, Dept. of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Medical University-So a, So a, Bul- garia,2SBAL Pediatric Diseases, Nephrology and Hemo- dialysis Clinic, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University - So a, So a, Bulgaria Introduction: Renal disease rst diagnosed in childhood often progresses towards chronic or end-stage kidney failure in adults. Identifying the molecular cause of the condition ineach case may allow a more personalized approach to therapy and consequently increase the likelihood of pre- serving the renal function of the patients in adulthood. Materials and Methods: TruSight One Sequencing Panel (Illumina) on MiSeq platform was used for mutation screening in 10 children with hematuria, proteinuria and/orcompromised renal function, who did not respond well to standard treatment or presented with unusual course of the disease. Sanger sequencing was applied for con rmation and establishing the origin of the mutations. The patho- genicity of each novel variant was evaluated according to the established ACMG criteria. Results: The NGS yielded both known and novel mutations in the sample set. In addition to well-known genes, such as WT1, GATA3, SALL1, AGXT andCOL4A4/5, the analysis of the that pathogenic variants in CD96, HNF1? and TREX1 may also contribute to the etiology of renal disease in children. Conclusions: The application of massive parallel sequen- cing of a large gene panel allowed us to identify the molecular cause of renal disease in a number of pediatricpatients where diagnoses were hindered by atypical presentation. In several of the cases the ndings allowed us to expand the clinical spectrum of the phenotypicpresentation of the mutations in certain genes. Grant references: D-73/2019; D01-285/17.12.2019 O.

For ana- tomical blockages so far only variants have been described as causal. Genomic copy number variations(CNVs) have been previously described as a cause of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and the urinary tract. Used Methods: Array-based molecular karyotyping was performed in 152 LUTO patients. Raw intensity data were collected for all persons and CNVs were called with CNVPartition, QuantiSNP and PennCNV. Using PLINKversion 1.07 and Excel the CNVs, identi ed in the patients, were compared to CNVs of 4168 controls. Overlapping CNVs between both groups were discarded. Furtherltering steps were used. Results: We identi ed 30 potential disease causing CNVs: 8 deletions and 22 duplications. Based on expres-sion of the comprised genes in developing mouse urethra we prioritized 6 CNVs. One of those CNVs comprised the gene GPC5 (MIM 602446), located on chromosome 13q31.3. Interestingly, of 8 patients reported in the literature with 13q duplications that comprise GPC5 , four showed urogenital malformations. So far, GPC5 was yet correlated with a speci c clinical phenotype. Conclusions: Systematic analysis of copy number variations in patients with LUTO is suitable for theidenti cation of new candidate genes. We prioritized GPC5 as candidate gene. For further veri cation of thiscandidate gene, re-sequencing of LUTO patients to identify further mutation carriers and functional characterization in zebra sh is warranted.

LUTOhas a birth prevalence of about three per 10.000 pregnancies.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 221Whole-Exome-Sequencing (WES) in eight families revealed two rare variants in the ZSCAN12 gene. The rst variant (c.1695-2A>C, minor allel frequency (MAF): 0,00005814) was identi ed in affected the second variant (c.62T>C; p.Ile21Thr, MAF: 0,00002595) was identi ed in an affected father and his affected son. Re- sequencing of ZSCAN12 in 263 LUTO patients identi ed three further patients who all carried the same variant c.637T>C, p.Phe213Leu (MAF: 0.0002046). It has not beenreported homozygous. Currently no genetic material of the parents is available for testing. ZSCAN12 is expressed in the developing mouse urethra at embryonic day 15.5 (GUDMAP: 5824; GUDMAP Con- sortium) and has been found to be differentially methylated in prostate carcinoma. Based on these preliminary data we suggest ZSCAN12 as a novel LUTO candidate gene. Further functional studies are warranted. A.C.H. is supported by BONFOR grants O-149.0123. L. Waffenschmidt: None.

Biallelic mutations in the LSR gene cause a novel type of infantile intrahepatic cholestasis T. Uehara 1, for Medical Genetics, Keio of Pediatrics, Keio University Hospi- tal, Tokyo, Japan LSR is expressed in the liver and other organs, and repre- sents a component protein of tricellular tight junctions. Theroles of LSR in human health and disease have not been established. Only one patient with intrahepatic cholestasis with a rare variant of LSR has been reported. Herein, wereport a patient who ful lled this criterion establishing LSR deciency as a novel cause of human liver disease. The proband was a 5-year-old female patient. At 5 months ofage, the infant developed severe and uncontrollable itching. The results of blood examination at 9 months of age showed elevated serum AST, ALT and TBA. Her verbal milestoneswere slightly delayed. A needle biopsy of the liver at 5 years of age showed paucity of interlobular bile duct. At 6years of age, whole-exome analysis of the samples from the patient and her parents was performed. The de novo non- synonymous variant (c.602C>T) and the maternally derived heterozygous frameshift (c.1396dup) gene.

P03.40.A Neo-TAD formation on 7q36.3 causes lung agenesis in three affected fetuses U. Melo 1, J. Piard2,M. M. Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, RG Development & Disease, Berlin, Germany, Berlin, Germany,41Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, RG Development & Disease, Berlin, Germany, Berlin, Dominican Republic Lung development is a tightly regulated process under the control of a large number of signaling molecules. The sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) signaling pathway is one of the main regulators of lung development during embryogenesis and mutations in SHH -related genes can lead to lung mal- formation. Here we report on three fetuses from one familywith severe malformation of the respiratory system. By ultrasound screening and autopsy after termination, a complete bilateral lung agenesis and near-complete agenesisof the tracheae was observed in all Using com- bination of array-CGH, Illumina whole-genome sequencing and rearrangement at 7q36.3, ~580 kb downstream the SHH gene. The rearrangement consisted of a 449 kb triplication, a 232 kb duplication and a 61 kb deletion, involving parts of the SHH and NOM1/MNX1/UBE3C topologically associated domains (TADs). Due to incorporation of a boundary between two TADs in the triplicated CNV, the rearrangements lead to the forma-tion of two neo-TADs each containing the known SHH enhancer MACS1 which is now placed next to MNX1 ,a222 J. del Picchiatranscription factor involved in caudal development. This situation can be expected to result in an ectopic activation of MNX1 in the lung at a time and place where SHH is nor- mally expressed; a misexpression that likely explains the lung aplasia. The rearrangement was present in mosaic state in the clinically unaffected father, explaining the recurrenceof the phenotype in his offspring 's. Thus, whole-genome sequencing in combination with Hi-C is a powerful tool to resolve and functionally interpret complex rearrangements. U. Melo: None. J. Piard: None. M. Klever: None. M. Mensa: None.

Nevertheless, a recessive form related tobiallelic variants in LZTR1 gene was described in 2018. Following publications discussed phenotype and inheritance patterns associated with this gene. Here we report sevenunrelated patients with clinically suspected NS and LZTR1 variants. Clinical features are provided in table1. Three novel variants and four previously reported variants wereidenti ed. Two patients, NS1564 and NS960, presented a recessive form of NS. In the rst patient, c.2074T>C;p. (F692L) and c.2070-2A>G were identi ed and the second one was homozygous for c.2074T>C;p.(F692L), both affect the BTB/POZ domain. In the rest of patients only oneaffected c.851G>A;p.(R284H), on kelch-5 domain; NS1199 presented a splicing variant, c.791+1G>T; and the patient 99 was heterozygous for c.905C>T;p.(Ala302Glu), located on kelch-5 domain. Overall, these cases provide more evidence on the clinical phenotype of NS associated with LZTR1 variants. These results are in accordance with the model that speci es that the location throughout the gene determines the inheritance form of NS. Our experience indicates that LZTR1 is a not infrequent cause of NS, so this gene should be included in next-sequencing panels for molecular diagnosis of NS.

PFIC is classi ed into ve types (PFIC1-5) based on the genetic defect involved in bile transport. Other benign late-onset pheno- types and non-progressive forms (BRIC, LPAC, DIC and224 J. del PicchiaICP) are caused by heterozygous mutations in the same gene pattern. Materials and Methods: DNA analysis of 15 candidate genes involved in PFIC and other related benign phenotypes was carried out. Amplicon-based NGS on 80 patients was performed. Bioinformatic and statistic pipelines wereapplied. Results: A total of 184 different variants has been identi ed in our cohort: 18 pathogenic, 46 VUS, 44 likely benign and 76 benign. P/LP mutations were found in 12% of patients: 2 in . Many patients had multiple variants in several genes. Patients had from 7 to 35 variants each and some SNPs were signi cantly associated with biochemical parameters and phenotypic features thatcould better explain clinics and accelerate the progression to liver failure. Conclusions: Our detection rate is according to other studies proposing multi-gene panels. Our analysis may be useful for the molecular diagnostics of PFIC and a better characterization and understanding of the linking betweenmolecular defects and different subtypes of the disease. The high SNPs prevalence let us to hypothesize a synergistic haplotype effect in determining different multifactorialcholestasis phenotypes and overlapping features. A. Mattiaccio: None. G.

Most in vivo studies have looked for correlationsbetween biomarkers of oxidative stress and TL, and have used leucocytes. We have used a murine model to investi- gate the potential impact of oxidative stress on TL in atissue-speci c manner and to assess telomere oxidation directly. Our model is a C57BL/6J mouse strain with a naturally occurring nicotinamide nucleotide transhy-drogenase (NNT) de ciency. The absence of Nnt results in high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. DNAwas extracted from healthy control mice, Nnt-de cient mice and Nnt-rescued mice (Nnt reinserted analysed. qPCR methods were used: mmQPCR to glycosylase of oxidation. Analysis of RTL from kidney revealed no signi cant difference (p>0.05) between the three groups. This is predictable since rapidly dividingleucocytes probably best represent early life replicative responses and tissues such as kidney, a slowly dividing tissue, represents the heritable load of TL. QPCR analysisof the DNA extracts, before and after FPG digestion showed there was no signi cant difference in the CT values between the three groups (p>0.05), implying there was nodiscernible difference in telomere oxidation levels. Further analysis will investigate tissues with variable metabolic and cellular turnover rates such as the brain, spleen, liver, heartand adipose tissue. E. Kidd: None. J. Pender: None. M.J.

There are no reliable markers for assessment of progression of NAFLD from steatosis to steatohepatitis that leads to liverbrosis and Polymorphism I148M in hydrolysis. Pathological variants of reticulum. Polymorphisms in HFE gene leads to intracel- lular iron accumulation and fatty degeneration of liver. Materials and Methods: Group of 59 patients with NAFLD was selected. The assessment of structural changes in liver was carried out by transient elastometry withcontrolled attenuation parameter. Polymorphisms in Association between homozygous carriage of I148M polymorphism and increase of ALT was found (p=0.011). A connection was established between the presence of the polymorphism and more severe steatosis (p=0.045). AST activity was higher in PiZ carriers than inAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 225patients without changes in this gene (p =0.049). H63D and C282Y polymorphisms of the HFE gene are associated with higher ALT (p =0.020 and p =0.030). A correlation between changes in mentioned genes and more severe brosis was not demonstrated. Conclusions: Polymorphisms in the PNPLA3, SER- PINA1, and HFE genes are associated with an increase in ALT and AST in patients with NAFLD. The homozygous variant of the andthe heterozygous C282Y in HFE are associated with more severe steatosis. However, con flicting data regarding liver brosis rates need further study. D.

P03.47.B Gene expression differences in non-obese, obese and previously obese subjects . dinge, Stockholm, Sweden Obesity is a worldwide public health issue associated with many comorbidities. Understanding its underlying causes and mechanisms is one of the keys to prevent and treat this condition. Besides obvious environmental causes, as phy-sical inactivity or poor nutrition, genetics is one of the main component of obesity. Here, we perform a transcriptomic study by 5 Cap-mRNA sequencing of subcutaneous white adipose (OB) and viously obese (POB) subjects, at fasting and hyper- insulinemia states. Differential gene expression analysisshowed few difference in the analysis of NO compared to POB subjects, while the comparison of OB subjects versus NO and versus POB displayed many transcriptomic chan-ges, with most of the genes in common in both comparison. Moreover, many genes were speci cally involved in expression changes between OB and POB subjects. Geneontology analysis revealed that those genes were involved in metabolic and cellular process pathways and in cardio- vascular diseases. Fasting and hyperinsulinemia metabolicstates had little in fluence on the results. This study demonstrates that a major gene expression difference is observed between obese and lean subjects, whether theywere never obese or got rid of their fat mass after a weight loss surgery, and that after this kind of surgery, many changes in gene expression appear. Further studies areneeded to identify precisely which genes are involved and ifthey can be a target for personalized medicine in the treat- ment of obesity by weight loss surgery. M. Tessarech: None.

Classi - cation of the missense variants is challenging as allelic heterogeneity is rife, and few recurrent variants are known. Data on ADPKD in Israeli populations is yet unavailable. Materials and methods: Patient samples ( n=112) From Israel were referred to Rambam Genetics Institute ADPKD gene panel testing ( PKD1, PKD1, HNF1B) . Next One (Illumina, n=77), or exome sequencing (ES, n=35); analysis the Genoox platform. NGS was supplemented by Sanger sequencing to achieve full cover- age of panel. GANAB ,DNAJB11 were included in ES testing. Results: A clinically signi cant variant (CSV) was identi however, eight PKD1 CSVs recurred in two or more patients, notably, in Jews of Persian and Ethiopian descent. HNF1B -related kidney disease was diagnosed in four individuals. Positive family history was linked withhigher CSV detection rates, 81%, compared with 60% when negative. Conclusions: This rst report on ADPKD genetics in Israel highlights recurrent CSVs in Israeli sub-ethnicities. HNF1B CSVs can account for an ADPKD-like phenotype.226 J. del PicchiaFamily history was a strong predictor for detection of a CSV. Our experience underscores the importance of utilizing ES as well as Sanger sequencing for variant detection. T. Paperna: None. A. Mory: None. A. O r:None. N. Damouny: None. D. Magen: None. I.

Methods: We included patients with pyeloplasty or PUV resection before age 18. Signs of renal injury were de ned as dialysis, nephrectomy, kidney transplantation, estimated glomerular ltration rate<60 ml/min/1.73m 2, high blood pressure, antihypertensive medication proteinuria, and/ or one kidney functioning<45%. In the GWAS, we compared 141 and 216 obstructive uropathy patients withand without signs of renal injury 5 years post-surgery, respectively. For the associated SNPs, we performedstratied analyses for PUV and UPJO, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses in the discovery and two replication samples of 102 PUV patients each. For the associated gene, we performed RNA and protein expression analyses in fetal tissues. Results: We observed suggestive associations with six SNPs in three loci, of which rs6874819 in CDH12 was the strongest ( P=7.5\u00d710 7). This SNP also seemed to be associated with time to renal injury in the PUV discoveryand replication samples. RNA expression analyses showed clear expression in fetal kidneys, which was con rmed by protein immunolocalization. Conclusions: This study identi edCDH12 as candidate gene for renal injury in PUV. CDH12 is a target of the proin flammatory We hypothesize that in PUV, MCP1 pathway upregulation due to increased urinary tract pressure is augmented in carriers of the CDH12 variant, exacerbating renal injury.

Most cases are recessive, caused by biallelic changes in these genes. These account for around 70% of cases, sug- gesting that additional genes, and non-coding or synon-ymous changes in known genes, remain to be identi ed. Non-CF bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous group ofAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 227disorders and adults may need to be investigated for PCD. Here we present an optimised pipeline for RNA analysis from nasal brushings taken from the inferior turbinate of patients with suspected PCD or non-CF bronchiectasis. We present analysis pipelines to investigate differences in gene expression, alternative splicing and the identi cation of deleterious splicing events. We developed gene-neutral and gene-speci c analysis protocols, from both nasal brushings stored in RNA-later and cells from nasal brushings culturedat the air-liquid interface (ALI). We present this RNA-seq approach as a particularly useful diagnostic tool to inves- tigate patients in whom a single pathogenic variant has beenidenti ed in a known PCD gene and where we suspect an alteration in splicing of the same gene due to a second intronic or synonymous / non-synonymous exonic variant.This represents a step towards using RNA analysis for increasing diagnostic yield in rare recessive respiratory disease.

The 2019 National Genomic Test Directory PHPT testing criteria are PHPTand calcium ratio (CCCR) >0.02 pre- <45y one of dis- ease, or b) hyperplasia, or c) ossifying bromas of the jaw, or d) a family history (FH) of PHPT. The testing criteria for FHH is CCCR <0.02. We reviewed 121 PHPT patients from the Cambridge and Guy's Endocrine Genetics clinic over a 4y period referred with multi-glandular disease, relevant FH, CCCR <0.01, age <50y, or >1 risk factor. We offered NGS panel genetesting of all known PHPT genes. Of the 121 patients, (92F, mean age 41y), a pathogenic variant was identi ed in 16% (11CASR ,6MEN1 ,1CDC73 ,1AP2S1) 4 VUS's. mean CCCR was 0.0073 in those with a CASR pathogenic variant vs 0.016 in those without (p 0.003). A CCCR <0.01 had a sensitivity of 82% and speci city of 81% for FHH. A positive FH was a strong predictor of a pathogenic variant whereas multi-glandular disease was not. In summary, genetic testing is recommended in PHPT at any age with i) syndromic PHPT, ii) relevant FH iii) a CCCR<0.01 and iv) multiple risk factors. S. Mariathasan: None. K. Andrews: None. E.

P03.55.A Biallelic loss of function variants del of Genetics and Genomics, RajinderNagar, New Delhi, India, 3Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates,4University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract com- prise a broad spectrum of renal and urinary tract mal-formations with renal agenesis being at the most severe end of the spectrum. It usually results in death in utero or in the perinatal period. Only three genes have been identi ed so far as causing renal agenesis. By exome/genome sequencing within a diagnostic setting, with combined database ana- lyses, we identi ed two unrelated patients presenting with congenital bilateral renal agenesis and homozygous loss of function variants (LoF) in the GFRA1 gene. Both patients had parental consanguinity and similarly affected, deceasedsiblings, suggesting an autosomal recessive inheritance. Patient 1 was homozygote for the nonsense variant NM_001348097.1:c.676C>T, p.(Arg226*). The secondpatient for p.(Thr432Profs*13)). Both variants are novel, identi ed for rst time in our database, and presumed to lead to LoF. The GFRA1 gene is not reported to be associated to any human phenotype in OMIM, but GFRA1 missense variants have been reported as associated to Hirschsprung disease in several patients, based on an oligogenic model. Gfra1-de cient mice demonstrate absence of enteric neurons and agenesis of the kidney,characteristics that are reminiscent of both Gdnf-and Ret- decient mice. The phenotype described in our patients is identical to the renal phenotype reported in Gfra1 null mice,however, no abnormalities of the enteric nervous system was reported in these two cases. In conclusion, these nd- ings strongly support the causal role of GFRA1 inactivating variants for an autosomal recessive form of bilateral Khan: (full or part-time); Signi AG, Germany. I. None. R.

Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary,5Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is one of the most promi- nent growth retardation disorders. However, both, thephenotype and underlying molecular alterations of SRS show a marked heterogeneity. SRS itself is an imprinting disorder, mainly associated with speci c molecular changes at speci c imprinted chromosomal regions. Disease causing point mutations are less common and vary widely in means of the affected gene. The suitability of panel-based NGSassays to identify monogenetic causes of SRS-like pheno- types has already been proven. The reasonableness of whole exome sequencing to identify point mutations in patientswith Silver-Russel syndrome features however, is still the subject of ongoing discussions. We examined samples of 75 patients referred for molecular testing for SRS using dif-ferent NGS-based approaches. The typical SRS-associated molecular alterations had been excluded before. The results of multi gene panel, whole exome sequencing, and trio-based whole exome sequencing approaches were compared. Taking together the results of all different approaches, in 19/75 patients a disease-causing variant could be identi ed. Most of these variants are associated with monogenetic differential diagnoses of Silver-Russell syndrome. The diagnostic yield raised from panel to whole exomesequencing to trio-based whole exome sequencing. Broad- ening the molecular sequencing approach increases the mutation detection rate in patients referred for moleculartesting of SRS without one of the typical molecular alterations. Some of the monogenetic disorders detected in our cohort have an important impact on the clinical man-agement and genetic counseling of affected families mainly in terms of recurrence risks, tumor development, and mentalAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Interactive e-Posters C.

Gorodna1,D .M Scienti Practical Center for Endocrine Surgery, Transplantation of Endocrine Organs and Tissues of the Ministry of Health ofUkraine, Kyiv, Ukraine Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) is a Disorder of Sex Development (DSD) that occurs at a frequency of 1 in 20,000 live births, is the most common DSD in people with karyotype 46, XY, caused by mutations in the AndrogenReceptor (AR) gene. More than 1000 AR gene mutations have been described in patients with AIS and prostate cancer. Almost 400 of them are located in ligand bindingdomain (LBD). The pathogenicity of mutations detected in AIS patients from Ukraine was analyzed. Directional sequencing of the PCR products of LBD-coding exons 7and 8 was performed on DNA samples of AIS patients after informed consent. The substitution X:67722905 T>C (rs9332970), exon 7, C>T (rs137852594) samesence variant was identi ed. It was predicted the creation of a new enhancer motif for SRp55 splisosome protein, and as a consequence a new donor splice site at the end of the last exon 8.

Despite efforts, the availability ofeffective non-invasive diagnostics assays is still limited. Cell free DNA (cfDNA) represents extracellular genetic information that already showed promises for various elds of genetic testing, including, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and cancer testing. Materials and methods: Using a murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis model we collected blood from 46 laboratory mice, grouped by stage of ulcerative colitis modeled by the duration of DSS administration.cfDNA was isolated and sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina System. sequenced data were against mouse genome (GRCm38.p6). Statisticalanalyses were performed by in-house Python and R scripts. Results: Besides the observed different fragment length distributions between control and colitis groups, weobserved also a signi cantly increasing amount of mouse genomic material with the advancing stage of the disease, measured by the proportion of sequenced reads mappable tothe mouse genome. In addition, to further investigate the pathophysiological processes behind the observed changes, we performed a sequence based differentiation of readsaccording to their mappability to the mouse nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, as well as of the detected bacterial communities. Conclusions: We observed signi cant differences between the control group and various disease stages in sequenced data. Our results suggest the utility of cfDNA asa potential screening marker for IBD and even its speci c stages and pathophysiological processes behind them.

Skawran Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany Introduction: Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper excess due to pathogenic ATP7B ATP7B codes for a copper-transporting ATPase. Sequencing of ATP7B is an important tool to diagnose the disease. However, variants of unknown sig- nicance (VUS) are detected frequently, impeding a clear diagnosis. Functional analyses can help to unambiguouslyclassify VUS. We aimed to functionally characterize four ATP7B VUS, detected in patients with clinically distinct or suspected WD. Methods: The ATP7B open reading frame was cloned into an expression vector and the VUS were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. After HEK293T cell transfection,ATP7B expression of the mutants was quanti ed at mRNA and protein level by qRT-PCR and western blot. To assess the mutant 's ability to export copper a copper-sensitive luciferase-based assay was used. Results: For all VUS ATP7B mRNA expression was signicantly reduced compared to wild-type and a benign polymorphism. Three VUS also led to decreased protein expression and copper transport capacity. These VUS had been detected in clinically distinct WD patients. One VUSled to protein expression and copper transport capacity at wild-type level. It had been detected in a patient with suspected WD. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest a pathogenic effect for three of the VUS. For one VUS our results hint at a benign effect. On-going immuno fluorescence assays will further address a possible protein mislocalization. Besides clarifying the clinical relevance of variants, functional characterization will help to understand the variant 's pathomechanism contributing to personalized treatment with fewer side effects.Supported by: DFG A.

(AD) are skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature, brachydactyly and progressive joint limitation. Cardiorespiratory involvement may be responsible for asevere prognosis in GD. Dominant mutations in the FBN1 andLTBP3 genes are associated with AD and GD, whereas recessive mutations in the ADAMTSL2 gene only with GD. These three genes encode for proteins of micro brillar network. The aim of this study is to improve understanding of natural history and genotype-phenotype correlations. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included patients with AD and GD followed in our center, with identi ed mutation(s). Data from the medical records were abstracted, recorded in an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using simple frequency analysis. Results: We described clinical and molecular data from 38 patients (20GD, 18 AD) with a mean age of 17 years. Mutations in the FBN1 ,ADAMTSL2 andLTBP3 genes were identi ed in 23, 12 and 3 patients, respectively. Early death occurred in nine cases. 45% of patients presented with valvulopathy, progressive in half of cases.

This rare type of dwar zm characterized with shortening of the middle and distal segments of the limbs. Herein we reported ninepatients from eight families with seven novel NPR2 mutations. Methods: Nine patients were diagnosed AMDM in a single centre from 2015 to 2020 were enrolled in this study. Their clinical, radiological and molecular genetic ndings examined retrospectively. The mutations in NPR2 gene were con rmed with direct sequencing. Results: All nine patiens in this group were admitted to hospital with the complaint of short stature. All had shortlimb type dwar sm with marked shortening middle and acral segment of the limbs. All had typical dysmorphic signs, brachydactyly, signi cant greater toes and normal intelligence. We identi ed one previously reported (c.2729 fs*) mutations. All new mutations identi ed in this group are likely pathogenic and meaningfull with the patients typical clinical presentations. Conclusions: Reporting new patients with novel muta- tions would contribute to better clinical dealination of this rare dysplasia and would help to established pathogenic mutations. References: 1.

Affected individuals show a strong cutis laxa phenotype with large skin folds at birth, hypotonia and cardiac abnormalities.232 J. del PicchiaMaterial and Methods: We performed single whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the causative molecular defect in our index patient. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing, qRT-PCR and Immunoblot analyses were performed to further investigate causality of the variants identi ed. Results: Here we report on two affected individuals from a non-consanguineous family from Hungary suffering from a multisystem condition with severe, generalized musclehypotonia and and strong juvenile cutis laxa. One child died in infancy, while the other signi cantly improved. Using WES and co-segregation analyses we found our proband tobe compound heterozygous for a novel missense and the rst so far described nonsense pathogenic variant affecting ATP6V1A . Expression studies revealed a strong degradation of the allele carrying the nonsense alteration. Additionally, patients 'dermal broblasts showed strong alteration of Cathepsin D processing indicating alterations of lysosomalfunction. Conclusions: This is the second report on pathogenic variants in ATP6V1A as the cause for a severe condition with cutis laxa. Our data expand the clinical spectrum of ATP6V1A -related phenotypes and show that beside mis- sense, also pathogenic variants are a possiblecause of ATP6V1A -ARCL.

COLIN 1, Hospital,ANGERS, France, 3Pole of Biology Genetic Pathology, Lille University Hospital - Center of Biology Genetic Pathology, LILLE, France Brachydactyly type A2 (BDA2, MIM 112600) is an auto- somal dominant pathology characterized by deviation andshortening of the middle phalanx of the index and / or second toe. It may be due to mutations in the BMPR1B gene(MIM 603248) or the GDF5 gene (MIM 601146) but may also depend on structural changes in 20p12.3 involving the BMP2 gene. Indeed, microduplications downstream of the BMP2 gene have been described in 5 families (2 German and 3 Chinese). Using an SNP-array technique, we identi- ed a new duplication of 45kb downstream of the BMP2 gene in a French family.

LPApromotes hair growth and differentiation. In this study, we aimed at delineating the genetic basis of LAH in patients without pathogenic variants in these three genes. Materials and Methods: Variant analysis was conducted using exome and Sanger cultures and hair follicles to evaluate the consequences of the identi ed variants. Results: We identi ed homozygous variants in C3ORF52 in four individuals from two families with LAH. C3ORF52Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 233was found to be co-expressed with lipase H in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle and the two proteins were found to directly interact. The LAH-causing variants were associated with decreased C3ORF52 expression and resulted in markedly reduced lipase H-mediated LPA biosynthesis. Conclusions: We could connect C3ORF52 to the LPA- mediated signaling pathway which, together with LPAR6 and LIPH, plays a crucial role in hair growth. LAH can be caused by abnormal function of any of these three proteins. N. Cesarato: None. L. Malki: None. O. Sarig: None. J. Mohamad: None. T. Canter: None. S. Assaf: None. M. Pavlovsky: None. D.

Although CTS is quite common, its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. An estimated heritability index of 0.46and a familial occurrence in 27-39% of the cases indicate that genetic factors must play a role in the pathogenesis. We report on a peculiar family in which CTS occurred in sub-sequent generations at an usually young age. Additionalclinical features included brachydactyly and short Achilles tendons resulting in toe walking in childhood. Material and methods: We performed exome sequen- cing and genome-wide linkage analysis to identify the pathogenic variant in this family. Several functional assays were performed to further study the causality of the variant.In addition, we sequenced a cohort of 216 patients to assess the role of this new candidate gene in the pathogenesis of CTS in a larger population. Results: We identi ed a family.Functional assays showed that the FBN2 variant impaired integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Moreover, we observed an increased TGF- signaling and brosis in the carpal tissues of affected individuals. A variant burden test in a large cohort of CTS patients revealed a signi cantly increased frequency of rare FBN2 variants in patient alleles compared to controls. Conclusions: Our data strongly suggest a role of FBN2 in the pathogenesis of CTS. S. Peeters: None. A. Decramer: None. S. Cain: None. P. Houpt: None. F. Verstreken: None. J. Noyez: None. C.

P04.14.B and variants in genes causing collageno- pathies identi ed patients isolated , D. Rots, I. Rezeberga, L. Gail te, A. Miskova Riga Stradins Riga, Latvia Introduction: Cervical insuf ciency is phenotypically distinguishable condition causing pregnancy loss or preterm delivery. A strong genetic component and few syndromic forms of cervical insuf ciency are described. Knowledge about the genetics of human cervix remodelling during pregnancy is scarce - only 12 maternal genes and their variants are implicated in cervical insuf ciency so far as identi ed by our systematic gene analysis before. Material and methods: We sequenced DNA from 21 patients with clinical presentation of isolated cervicalinsufciency using Illumina 's TruSight One NGS kit. Genes having rare deleterious variants identi ed in our patients ( n=694) were annotated for the pathway enrichments using in genes from enriched phenotype-relevant pathways were manually234 J. del Picchiacurated based on variant 's pathogenicity, gene 's expression pattern, mode of inheritance and disease mechanism, to assign likelihood for contribution to the patients ' phenotype. Results: Pathway-enrichment analysis revealed increased variant burden in 15 pathways (max p-value 2.47E-03) playing roles in tissue mechanical and biomechanical properties, i.e. collagen biosynthesis, cell-extracellular matrix communications and previously unnoticed pathwaysof hemidesmosome assembly, and focal adhesion. unknown signi cance and (likely) pathogenic 11 patients were classi ed as potential to increase susceptibility to the development of non-syndromic cervical insufciency. Conclusions: Cervical insuf ciency being an expression point in a phenotypic continuum of collagenopathies should be investigated further using multiple approaches. This might open up new opportunities to improve patientevaluation and management in the future. L. Volozonoka: None. D. Rots: None. I. Kempa: None. A. Kornete: None. D. Rezeberga: None. L.

It iscaused by the recurrent heterozygous missense in ERF, which encodes the ETS2 repressor factor (ERF) protein. The ETSfamily of transcription factors are involved in cellular pro- liferation and differentiation, embryological development, hematopoiesis, lymphocyte function and apoptosis. Theexact pathomechanism of Chitayat syndrome remains unknown. So far, only seven individuals with molecularly conrmed Chitayat syndrome have been documented in the literature. Methods: We performed a systematic phenotype analysis of six unpublished individuals with Chitayat syndrome. Results: We found unreported phenotypic features and a great variability of pulmonary manifestations. Only one individual presented with a history of assisted ventilation,and one of the remaining presented with an atypical phenotype lacking any obvious pulmonary compromise. Conclusions: Ourndings extend the phenotype spec- trum associated with the recurrent ERF variant c.266A>G and contribute to improved diagnostic strategies in individuals with hand hyperphalangism. A.

CCAL is usually seen in polygenic disorders (hypercalce- mia, gout, arthritis), but in rare cases runs in families as a dominant trait (usually CCAL2, MIM #118600, ANKH gene). CCAL1 is extremely rare with only four families known to date: an Ashkenazy-Jewish kindred (PMIDs 2383078 and 29578045), a family from Maine (PMID7887424), a family from the Netherlands and France (PMID 24743232), and a Long Island NY family (PMID 29578045). These families all demonstrated a speci variant, elongated tein (p.Ter402Leuext*19). We report another 4-generationCCAL1 kindred from Rhineland-Palatinate (comprising 8 females and 3 males) also demonstrating the TNFRSF11B c.1205A>T variant. All patients (11/11, 100%) had early-onset osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis with an onset of symptoms between 16 and 30 years, and all had swelling of joints, motion restriction, and intense pain. Three probands(3/10, 30%; no data in a deceased family member) also had digital polyarthritis. First, knee, elbow, ankle and wrist joints were affected, followed by spinal destruction.Remarkably, ball-and-socket joints (e.g. hip joints) were only minimally affected (only an affected 30-year-old male). The early onset and familial clustering led to themolecular diagnosis. This is the rst CCAL1 family from Germany, providing further understanding of the clinical signs and treatment (including physical therapy, orthoses,antirheumatic drugs, experimental treatment with inter- leukin inhibitors, and multiple joint surgery).

P04.17.B Three families with suspected Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and glycine substitution in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes S. D\u00f6hnert 1, Reichenbach2, in the Gly-X-Y-triplet disrupt the type I collagen triple helix structure and folding,and typically result in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and have not yet been associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome(EDS). OI is characterized by bone fragility, whereas EDS affects the connective tissue resulting in joint hypermobi- lity, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Although, an OI/EDS overlap \"syndrome characterized by clinical hallmarks of EDS and mild or absent OI-phenotype is also described. The underlying mutation spectrum is wide, butincludes glycine substitutions. Material and Methods: Here, we report three patients mainly showing joint hypermobility and unusual skin. Paneldiagnostic via sequencing by synthesis was conducted including candidate genes contributing to connective tissue disorders. Sanger sequencing was used for analyses ofsegregation patterns in parents. Results: All index patients carried each an undescribed, heterozygous glycine substitution. In two gene; c.434G>A/p. (Gly145Arg) in COL1A2 gene) was maternal inherited and segregated with the symptoms in both families. In the othercase the substitution occurred de novo (c.179G>A/p. (Gly60Asp) in COL1A2 gene). Comparable to our patients, glycine substitutions in the more N-terminal region of bothgenes are already described with \"OI/EDS overlap \" syndrome. In detail, one of our families showed an EDS- phenotype with additional minimal OI-symptoms (shortstature, blue sclera), whereas the others were clinical classi ed as EDS-phenotype. Conclusions: Despite the detection of glycine substitu- tion, the patients could manifest a more typical EDS phenotype rather than OI. Certainly, subclinical symptoms for OI can additionally occur and should be considered. S. D\u00f6hnert: None. H. Reichenbach: None. S. Demuth: None. S. Weidensee: None. K. Wilhelm: None. I.

CandeloFundacion Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia Background: Craniosynostosis is the premature closure of the skull sutures. Patients with these condition undergo several surgical procedures, which are not able to fullyrestore appearance and functionality due to insuf cient bone growth and suture refusion. Most mutations disrupt genes that encode for members of the broblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family. Materials and Methods: A knock out mouse with Fgfr2c342Y/C342Y was generated for phenotypic analysisby histological staining Fgfr2c342Y/C342Y homozygous236 J. del Picchia(HOM) mouse embryos from embryonic day (E) 14.5 and E 16.5 stages. Morphological characterisation of the ectopic cartilages in the mutant specimens was done against the HET and WT by calculating the surface area, perimeter, width on the parietal cartilage in each genotype and cellular characterisation by obtaining the cellular density and shapedescriptors. Molecular characterisation was determined by mmunohistochemistry of Collagen I and II. Results: We identi ed a signi cant parietal cartilage expansion in HOM embryos since E14.5 with higher perimeter, surface area, and high cellular density. Addi- tionally, characteristic cell morphology comprised; highcellular area and perimeter and circular or rounded shape. These ndings were associated with abnormal intensity and localization pattern of Collagen type I and II. Conclusions: A possible switch off on the intramem- branous ossi cation of the parietal and frontal primordial bone and switch on of endochondral ossi cation process supported by the cellular, morphological and molecular ndings of the abnormal cartilage expansion lead to a novel hypothesis of coronal suture fusion that can future drugtarget on this condition.

Altunoglu1,4 1Istanbul University, Istanbu Faculty of Medicine, Medical Genetics Department, Istanbul, Turkey,2Undiagnosed Diseases Program, Common Fund, National Institutes ofHealth, Bethesda, MD, United States, 3Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,MD, United States, 4Koc University, School of Medicine, Medical Genetics Department, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Dyssegmental dysplasia (DD) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by micromelia and anisospondyly. Two distinct forms are described;Silverman-Handmaker (DDSH) characterized by severe shortening of limbs and perinatal lethality, and Rolland- Desbuquois (DDRD) with survival by HSPG2 but the aetiology of DDRD has not been explained. Here, we present the rst DDRD patient reported to have an HSPG2 variant. Materials and Methods: Detailed phenotyping and next- generation sequencing were performed. Results: The patient is a 15-month-old female with short bones, flared metaphyses, camptodactyly, anisospondyly,pes equinovarus, flat face, micrognathia, cleft palate and the history of respiratory distress in infancy. She was diagnosed as DDRD given milder skeletal ndings and a prolonged survival in comparison to DDSH. Whole exome analysis revealed a homozygous NM_005529.7:c.9970G>A(p. Gly3324Arg) variant on HSPG2 which was predicted to be pathogenic by in silico analyses. Conclusions: The phenotypic heterogeneity and clinical overlap and DDRD raise the question ofwhether HSPG2 variants lead to distinct DD forms or represent a single disorder with variable phenotypic spectrum. In a review of the literature, we recognised threepatients reported as DDSH whereas they had milder skeletal ndings and survival age between 13 months and 7 years, compatible with DDRD. Strikingly, they harboured novelHSPG2 variants, one of which was detected in our case. In the light of all these ndings, we conclude that DDSH and DDRD are allelic and represent a single disorder with aspectrum of severity. T. Kalayci: None. N. Balanda: None. C.R. Ferreira: None. P04.23.B FROM CEREBRAL HEMORRAGE AND SUSPIC- TION OF CHILD ABUSE TO DIAGNOSIS OF FAMILIAR EHLERS DANLOS SYNDROME DUE TO DELECION IN COL5A1 GENE P. Reina 1, A. Spain Introduction: The misdiagnosis of Ehler Danlos syndrome (EDS) and child abuse is well known, usually in relation- ship to skin lesions or bone fractures. At our case, the rst manifestation was an aborted lethal episode in an infant dueto a cerebral hemorrhage. Clinical Case: A 4-month-old boy was founded uncon- scious after sleep. He was admitted to the pediatric intensivecare unit with a subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage and severe cerebral edema. Child abuse was suspected. Familiar antecedents: Mother, 34 years, rst gravida. She was followed up during infancy due to small size. She has joint hypermobility. Her brother died at sixth month due to supposed sudden infant death. One 50 years old auntpresented a cerebral hemorrhage. Healthy father, 30 years old. No consanguinity. The child presented hypermovility and skin hyperextensibility. EDS vascular type wassuspected. NGS analysis was performed using Illumina (NextSeq 500) technology with a ClearSeq InheritedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 237Disease panel (Agilent Thecnologies) and consisted in the analysis of the coding and intronic regions of collagen deciency related gene. The study did not show any pathogenic variant and was completed by analysis of gene dosage by MLPA (P331; P332), resulting in patient HETEROZYGOUS for deletion of exons 5-7 of theCOL5A1 gene. Presence of deletion was con rmed in affected familial members. Conclusions: Vascular complications in nonvascular of the EDS could be life-threatening. - Misdiag- nosis of child abuse should be considered in EDS - The relevance of study microdeletions in cases not diagnosed bygene sequencing.

While both disorders are characterized by early onset bone fractures, progressive bone deformity and scoliosis, Bruck pterygium. FKBP10/ KRT14 mutations have been reported to be present in patients with OI-typeXI and Epidermolysis bullosa simplex(OIEBS). The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical ndings and genotype-phenotype correlation in the Turkish cohort with FKBP10 mutation. Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients from fteen families were enrolled. FKBP10 mutations studied via sanger sequencing or next generation sequencing. Theparents of all patients had consanguineous marriages. 16 patients were followed up for 6.2 years (7 months-15.5 years). Results: We identi ed p.Gly300Ter in eleven patients and p.Gly278Argfs*95 in one patient who live same region. Ten of these patients were compatible with OI-XI, twopatients had Bruck1 phenotype. One patient with Bruck1 who lives different region had a novel (c.1256 +1G>A)mutation. We also found same mutation (c.321_353del) in ve patient with OIEBS who lives same city. Pamidronate treatment was given to 16 follow-up patients. Conclusions: The clinical course of the patients was progressive; bone fractures were started in the infantile period (15/18) and continued as more than 1 fracture (9/16)per year. During the follow-up period, severe limb deformity (7/16) and scoliosis (11/16) developed and no patient could walk (16/16). Although most families are notrelated, they had the same mutation which is attributed to the founder effect. A. Y\u00fcksel \u00dclker: None. D. Uludag Alkaya: None. G. Yeil:None. None. Z.

P04.26.B Wide sutures and fontanels, delayed speech development and a hoarse voice useful signs in diagnosing KBGsyndrome, clinical, molecular and cytogenetic descrip- tion of 12 Obersztyn1,J .B a l1 1Institute of the Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland,2Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, Chantilly, VA, UnitedStates Introduction: KBG syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by short stature, macrodontia, developmental delay, behavioral problems as hyperactivity, velopharyngeal insuf ciency causing feeding problems and speech delay and by delayed closing of sutures and fonta- nels. Most of the patients with KBG syndrome have a mutation of ANKRD11 gene or micro-rearrangement encompassing this gene. Patients and methods: We present clinical evaluations of 12 patients with the clinical features of KBG syndrome atthe age from 4 months to 17 years. The mutation analysis in these patients was performed using panel next generation sequencing (6pts), whole exome typical dysmorphic features for KBG syndrome found in all patients, the majority of patients hadwide sutures and fontanels (7/12), delayed speech (9/11), feeding problems (9/12). Hoarse voice was noticed in 4 patients and short stature, below 2 SD in two patients,between -1-2 SD in 7 patients. Abnormal behavior was noted in 4 patients, macrodontia in 3 patients.238 J. del PicchiaConclusions: The fact that the delayed closing of sutures and fontanels was observed in more than half of our patients with KBG syndrome caused by mutations or rearrange- ments of ANKRD11 gene con rms the role of this gene in skull and suture formation. Speech delay is found in majority of patients with this syndrome. Rarely describedsign - hoarse voice could reinforce clinical knowledge in diagnosing KBG syndrome.

EKV is mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is mainly caused bypathogenic variants in GJB3 ,GJB4 orGJA1 . Results: We describe a large family with twelve patients ofve generations affected by a skin disorder. The index patient shows typical features of EKV. Mutation analysis in seven affected members from three generations using Next Generation and Sanger sequencing methods revealed that allof them carry both the heterozygous unclear variant c.783G>C, p.(Gln261His) in GJB3 is characterized by diffuse erythro- derma and blistering at birth and progressive hyperkeratosislater in life and is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Furthermore, two unaffected members were analyzed, one of them carries none of the variants, theother only the GJB3 variant.Conclusions: It is remarkable, that all seven tested affected family members from three generations carry both variants in GJB3 andKRT10 . Although the KRT10 variant is pathogenic, it cannot be excluded that the GJB3 variant has an impact on the phenotype, since the initial suspected diagnosis was EKV. However, it cannot be excluded thattheGJB3 variant is neutral. In this case, analysis of patients with suspected EKV should include pathogenic variants in KRT10 . A. Hotz: None. S. Redler: None.

Sabir 1, St Thomas 'Hospital, Kingdom,2University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom Introduction: Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a rare auto- somal dominant skeletal dysplasia caused by FGFR3 mutations leading to disproportionate short stature. Classi-cally HCH presents in toddlers or school-age children, as limb-to-trunk disproportion is often mild and easily over- looked during infancy. We report experiences from our UKHCH cohort of ~30 patients and review recent literature to explore the antenatal detection of HCH. Methods: We reviewed the rate of antenatal HCH detection in our 29 patient cohort and describe relevant case-date. We then conducted a systemic, retrospective literature review using PUBMED and MEDLINE, identify-ing antenatally suspected / detected HCH cases. antenatal scanning history. Results: Antenatally suspected (and concurrent or deferred molecularly con rmation) HCH has been reported 10 times in the literature (between 2004-2019) and in 6 of our 29 patient cohort. Key sonographic markers included reduced; femur length, biparietal diameter and humerallength. Conclusions: HCH is increasingly detected both antena- tally and in infancy, contrary to previous descriptions. Thisis likely due to greater HCH awareness, improved imaging and easier molecular testing. Thus one should consider HCH outside the classical presenting period. Studying thenatural history of earlier cases is important with the advent of several targeted FGFR3 therapies currently in trials forAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics such therapies may soon be trialled in HCH and are likely most efcacious during earliest skeletal maturation.

Thiel1, N. Hauer1, C. and Adolescent Medicine, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg FAU, Erlangen, Germany Short stature is a common concern in childhood with an incidence of 3%. After exome analysis about 60% remain without diagnosis (idiopathic short stature, ISS). Recentidenti cation of heterozygous mutations in ACAN in 1.4% individuals con rmed that single, large-effect var- iants strongly affect height (appr. 15cm nal adult height). We therefore hypothesized that heterozygous variants in other autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia genes also contribute to ISS. We selected exome data from 368 ISSfamilies where previous analysis showed no mutations in a known growth-associated gene and selected 114 genes known to be involved in autosomal recessive inheritedskeletal dysplasia, extracted from the \"Nosology and Clas- sication of Genetic Skeletal Disorders \"(Bonafe et al. 2015). From a total of 391 heterozygous variants weselected 33 variants in 26 genes which were classi ed as ACMG class 4/5 and compatible with segregation in the families and were thus considered strong candidates for ISS.This accounted for 31 patients (8.4%). No class 4/5 variant in any of the 26 genes was detected in 343 controls (p<1e- 85). Frequently affected genes were ACAN (6 individuals) and NPR2 (3 individuals) representing 2.5% of the study group. In addition to missense variants in 17 genes, a nonsense variant association between rare mono- allelic deleterious variants in genes for recessive skeletaldysplasia and idiopathic short stature and provide furtherevidence for the contribution of rare, large-effect variants to the etiology of this common trait.

About 20% of thepatients are reported to develop skin cancer at young adulthood. All IWC patients are carriers of a heterozygous keratin (KRT)10 orKRT1 variant leading to a shifted reading frame and the translation of an aberrant carboxyl (C)-terminus. This results in the nuclear localization of the KRT10/KRT1 protein instead of cytoplasmic. About 20years ago, two patients were described as MAUIE patients. They showed the typical IWC-phenotype including the development of pale spots. Both patients developedaggressive and fatal cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). A genetic analysis is not yet done. Our study aimed to identify an IWC-correlated frameshift variant in bothpatients and to clarify whether they suffered from IWC. We performed whole exome sequencing on genomic DNA from FFPE cSCC tissue of deceased patients to IWC-associated variants. A for the aberrantly shifted C-terminus, was identi ed in each patient and the nuclear localization of KRT10 was con rmed by immuno- fluorescence staining. Our study reclassi ed both MAUIE patients as patients with a speci c form of IWC. The fatal course of the disease is not typical for the other IWC forms, but it emphasizes the importance of skin cancer screening in all IWC-patients. We recommend the regular intensiveexamination of their skin for cancers and a good education of the patients with reference to their disease. B. Burger: None. A. Ghosh: None. C.K.Y. Ng: None. S. I.

LAM The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, ChinaIntroduction: Hypomelanosis of Ito is a neurocutaneous syndrome, characterized by distinctive skin manifestations,with or without multisystem involvements. While the exact cause of hypomelanosis of Ito is unknown, chromosomal mosaicism as a result of sporadic gene mutation has beensuggested in literature. Materials and Methods: In our Clinics for Rare diseases Referral (CRareDr), we encountered a 3-year-old girlpresenting with characteristic skin pigmentation and devel- opmental delay, suggesting hypomelanosis of Ito This case was enrolled in our undiagnosed diseases program (UDP)for ending diagnostic odyssey. We initiated genetic analysis for neurodevelopmental impairment using whole-genome (WGS) and whole in the KIF13A gene was identi ed in the patient. The variant is a single nucleotide duplication causing a shift in the translational reading frame and premature termination of the protein. The variant is absent in control population in gnomAD exomes andgenomes. Conclusions: KIF13A is a relatively new gene with a limited number of studies on its function and has not beenreported to cause any hereditary conditions. To date, KIF13A is known to interact with adaptor complex AP-1, forming a complex that is responsible for the transportationof a number of proteins and receptors to plasma membrane and endosomal organelles. The role of KIF13A in melanosome biogenesis is well-demonstrated in in-vitrostudies and may explain the underlying pathogenesis of skin hypopigmentation in hypomelanosis of Ito. C. Lam: None.

In this context, muta- tions in the rst-propeller of LRP5 result in high bone mass (HBM) in AMH, suggesting this gene as a suitable candidatefor studying the hominin evolution of bone mass. Material and Methods: Variants were looked for in the publically available Neanderthal and Denisovan genomesand functionally tested by a luciferase assay in Saos-2 cells. A molecular homology model of LRP5 was generated using MODELLER (v.9.22). Introgression was inferred in theSimons Genome Diversity Project using the CRF method. Evidences of selective pressures at LRP5 in AMH were sought using PopHuman browser. Results: displayed signi two also showedreduced inhibition by DKK1. Modelling suggested that these mutations either affected the 3D structure of the rst -propeller, or impinged on the interaction of LRP5 with DKK1. We observed that the LRP5 genomic region in AMH is depleted of introgression from Neanderthals and/or Denisovans and that the functional Neanderthal andDenisovan mutations are at a very low frequency in current human populations. Conclusions: The variants identi ed in Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes, together with the evolutionary ana- lyses in the LRP5 region suggest that this gene may have been involved in HBM determination in C.

P04.39.C Looking for genetic modi ers in Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue manifested in the ocular,skeletal and cardiovascular systems. It is most frequently caused by mutations in FBN1 with high clinical penetrance, but showing a high inter and intra-familial variability, thatcannot be explained by the current knowledge of genotype- phenotype correlation. In order to improve knowledge of the whole genetic background of this disease, this studyaims to identify genetic modi ers of the phenotypic expression of Marfan syndrome, looking for the intra- familial variability with known causal mutation in FBN1. Material and Methods: A total of 22 Marfan syndrome patients with different severity from 8 families with known FBN1 mutation, were exome sequenced. For exome widegene-set analyses F-SKAT sequence test) was performed. At the intra-family level, non-common rare protein changing variants among rst- degree relatives with severe and mild phenotypes were selected for discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). Results: F-SKAT test showed no gene with signi cant differences after Bonferroni test between severe and mild phenotype group of patients. Nevertheless, DAPC showedtwo genes of retinal homeostasis, NXNL1 gene and RP1L1 gene, as one of the principal contributors to the discrimina- tion analysis between mild and severe phenotype. Conclusions: The genetic architecture of Marfan syn- drome is very complex, however, as it was previously described in the literature, this study point to the genesrelated to retinal homeostasis as possible genetic modi ers of the disease.

Gl\u00e4ser Department of Human Genetics, Freiburg, Germany242 J. del PicchiaIntroduction: Monogenic disorders due to apparently balanced reciprocal translocations are rarely reported. There are few reports of interstitial deletions involving FBN1 -gene and only one case of a patient with Marfan syndrome and a complex chromosome rearrangement. However, no disrup- tion of FBN1 due to a translocation has been reported so far. Clinical report: We report on a mother and daughter with clinical symptoms of connective tissue disorder. The 39-year-old mother presented with congenital strabismus,muscle weakness, muscle hypotrophy of forearms and calves, reduced exercise tolerance and muscle and joint pain. Skeletal manifestations included arachnodactyly, jointlaxity and foot deformity. Her father and a paternal uncle had skeletal abnormalities and died unexpectedly in young adulthood. Her 18-year-old daughter ful lled the Ghent criteria for Marfan syndrome. Methods and Results: Connective tissue panel diagnos- tics did not reveal pathogenic variants in the mother. R-banded karyotyping of lymphocyte cultures revealed the same reciprocal translocation in mother and daughter: 46, XX,t(2;15)(q22;q21.1). Chromosome microarray analysisrevealed no imbalances. Subsequent FisH analysis with region-speci c BAC probes for 2q and 15q narrowed down the translocation break point to a region of approximately110 kb from g.43663778 proximal the FBN1 . Conclusions: In order to prove a possible disruption of FBN1 we plan to perform long range PCR, next generation mapping and RNA sequencing. We emphasize the impor- tance of a combination of cytogenetic and moleculardiagnostic techniques to reveal the cause of monogenic diseases typically caused by point mutations. B. Herr: None. K.

Amsterdam, Netherlands,2Centre Connective Amsterdam, Netherlands,3Prodia laboratories, Jakarta, Indonesia Introduction: Correct classi cation is crucial for reliable diagnostic DNA-testing of patients. The classi cation of variants ranges from benign (class 1) to pathogenic (class 5). General recommendations for classi cation have been developed, like the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Variant classi cation differs per method used.We compared three different guidelines, by reanalyzing patients 'data of the FBN1 gene. Materials and Methods: Variants in the FBN1 gene, found in our lab, were used to compare the outcome of three different variant classi cations: the ACMG guidelines, the methods of our accredited laboratory (ISO15189-RvA-M174) and recommendations from the Revised Ghent nosology of Marfan syndrome (Loeys et al. 2010). Results: We classi ed, by using our guidelines, 869 variants as pathogenic. 77 of these are classi ed as benign according to Loeys et al. or VUS according to ACMG. A large number of variants that we classi ed as benign would be classi ed as likely benign or VUS according to the other guidelines. Conclusions: Comparison of various variant interpreta- tions shows that pathogenic variants were classi ed as VUS or even benign by using the other guidelines. This was mainly caused by using an incorrect consensus sequence forthe amino acid motif of the 47 EGF domains in brillin-1 (Loeys et al.) or not using speci c properties of the protein. Different use of frequency data causes a large difference ininterpretation of benign variants. These data emphasize that knowledge of the disease and the protein involved are indispensable in correct interpretation of variants. G. Pals: None. S.A. Stolk: None. A. Maugeri: None. D. Micha: None.

Aim: We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield in these group o patients and present the variants identi ed. Methods: Using targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with a panel for 174 genes (TruSightCardio Illumina) related to cardiologic diseases we screened 52 patients (37 males/15 females) evaluated for a Marfan/Marfan like phenotype using Ghent nosology, between 2015-2020 at the Center for Genomic Medicine University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara, Romania. Results: Diagnosis was identi ed in 55.7% most(25) pathogenic 5 frameshift 17missense neonatal Marfan Syndrome (NM_000138.4:c.3143T>C and c.3217G>A). Of these, 10 are previously unreportedvariants. Nine out of 52 patients originated from 3 families. Diagnosis in 3 other patients involved COL3A1, TGFBR1 and SLC2A10 genes. Conclusions: This study broadens the spectrum of pathogenic variants in FBN1 gene, providing an update of the molecular basis of Marfan Syndrome in Romania. M. Puiu: None. A. Chirita-Emandi: None. N.

We identi ed an in-frame deletion (p. Ser605del), segregating for the rst time as an autosomal dominantmutation, in a MDPL patient from whom dermalbroblasts (HDFs) have been derived. Cells displayed in vitro abnormalities of nuclear envelope morphology, presence of micronuclei, a large number of autophago- somesand a signi cant accumulation of prelamin A, strongly linked to altered cellular proliferation and geno- micinstability. DNA damage-induced treatment in MDPL-HDFs revealed a poor capacity of DNA repair, an arrestin G0/G1 phase transition, and a lower number of cells in the S phase. Moreover, Western Blot analysesshowed a nuclearreduction of POLD1 in MDPL-HDFs compared to WT in basal condition but a statisticallysigni cant and persistent increase after cisplatin/1-Gy X-ray damage when comparedto WT. Analysis of telomere length exhibited an increased rate of telomere shortening, accompanied by anaccumula- tion of unrepaired and TelomereInduced Foci after 1-Gy X-ray treatment enabled us gure out that POLD1 repairs less ef ciently DNAdamage and its activity is mainly associated with the homologous recombination phase. Finally, we also generated human induced pluripotent stem cells from patient 'sbroblasts showing thepeculiar pre- sence of micronuclei. Knowing the mechanistic basis for the association of DNA damage and failed DNA repair with aging wouldopen up new therapeutic possibilities for thisrare disease. C. De Masi: None. P.

The aim of the study was to characterize molecularly Polish MeDOC patients. Materials and methods: A group of 161 patients with clinical symptoms of MeDOC was enrolled to the study.Genetic analysis was performed using self-designed custo- mized NGS panel. Sanger sequencing or mutations veri cation. Results: We identi ed full genotype in 125 (78%) patients. In 17 (11%) patients we didn 't detect any mutation, while in 19 (12%) we found mutation in oneallele only, despite expected autosomal recessive inheri- tance. Overall, we detected mutations in 27 distinct genes. The 33 patients had mutations in more than one geneinvolved in skin barrier functioning: 13 of them had pathogenic mutations in two genes, while in remaining 20 cases variant of unknown signi cance was detected in at least one of the genes. Conclusions: Our diagnostic strategy proved to be an efcient and sensitive diagnostic tool for MeDOC patients. Our data provide further information regarding molecular epidemiology of skin barrier defects and also focus on the presence of secondary mutations, which have importantimpact on genetic counseling and, presumably, may affect therapy.

Common risk loci explain parts ofthe trait heritability, but a substantial fraction needs to be elucidated. Parts of the missing heritability could be explained by rare, penetrant mutations that might occur denovo in genes potentially involved in craniofacial devel- opment. A previous study by our group identi ed three nsCL/P susceptibility genes with rare recurrent de novomutations ( PAXIP1 ,MDN1 ,ANK1 ). The present study aims at assessing a contribution of the rare mutations found in these nsCL/P susceptibility genes to cleft development byusing CRISPR/Cas9 generated mouse models. We created ve knock-in mouse strains that carried human missense mutations in Paxip1 (1 mutation) , Ank1 (1 mutation), and Mdn1 (3 different mutations). Embryos at embryonic day E18.5 were dissected and assessed for craniofacial anoma- lies using skeletal preparations and microscopic assessment.No craniofacial anomalies were observed for E18.5 embryos in the F 0generation in any of the ve knock-in strains. In the F 1generation, 2/31 E18.5 pups carrying the knocked-in Paxip1 missense mutation in a heterozygous state presented with abnormal body posture, a broader snout and a subtle increase in distance between the palatal pro-cesses, suggesting a role of the missense variant in Paxip1 in craniofacial development. Further follow-up studies in mice homozygous for the variants and more precise phe-notyping methods are ongoing. N. Ishorst: None. E.Z. Kvon: None. Y. Zhu: None. S. I. None. C.S. Pickle: None. S. A.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed >40 risk loci that contribute to nsCL/P risk, and it has beensuggested that ~30% of phenotypic variance is explained by common genetic variation. In the absence of surgery, nsCL/ P is a detrimental phenotype, which implies a considerableeffect on reproductive tness. Thus, rare variants are likely to also contribute to nsCL/P etiology. First studies have suggested nsCL/P candidate genes that harbor causative rarevariants, or a burden thereof. These studies included the analysis of established \"syndromic \"genes ( n=6 genes), genes with established role development ( n =5), and the identi cation of mutations in genes of the epithelial cadherin-p120-catenin complex segregating within multiply affected families ( n=5). However, inde- pendent replication is lacking. Here, we aimed at providing further genetic evidence for an involvement of these genes in nsCL/P etiology, through the identi cation of additional evidence for rare variants from a large Central-European cohort. Using single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), we obtained high-con dent sequencing results for 14 of the 16 genes in 711 nsCL/P cases, 761 population- based controls, and 234 case-parent trios. At individual level, we identi ed four novel loss-of-function (LoF) var- iants (3 cases / 1 control). The variants observed were LoF-mutations in CDH1 ,CTNND1 Fur- analyses of missensevariants, burden and pedigree analyses, are currently ongoing and will help to further understand the etiology of nsCL/P.

Materials and methods: Our study reviewed the clinical and molecular ndings of AMDM and short stature patients with NPR2 mutations. 12 AMDM DNAs and more than 200 short stature DNAs were tested, after SHOX MLPA testing, in the molecular biology laboratory of Necker Hospital. Results: NPR2 mutations were identi ed in all AMDM cases and in 8 short stature patients. 23 different mutations were identi ed: nonsense, frameshift, splice and in shortstature. Heterozygous parents of AMDM patients were relatively small. All AMDM patients were of short birth and nal heights (125-130 cm). Apart small extremities, 6 had large hallux and 7 had curved radius with limited pronation. Out of 12 cases, 8 had hyperlaxity, 7 scoliosis and 8 dental misalignment and arched palate. All heterozygous patientswere of normal birth size and grew between -2,5 to -1,5 SD. They had normal envergure/height ratio, even if X-rays showed thick radius. 2/8 had IV and V brachymetacarpia. Conclusions: our study supports AMDM genetic homo- geneity. We importance NPR2 heterozygous mutations should be considered in short stature with minor skeletal changes.

The etiology of nsCL/P is multifactorial, whereby genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and potentialgene-environment interactions all contribute to susceptibility. The present project is a genome-wide association study(GWAS) in a medium-sized nsCL/P cohort encompassing a total of 285 nsCL/P patients and 1,212 controls from The Netherlands and Belgium. Twenty of 40 previously reported nsCL/P susceptibility loci were replicated, and at the well- established nsCL/P susceptibility locus at chromosome 8q24.21, the ed 62 genome-wide signi cant SNVs. These ndings underline the validity of this sample. SNV-based analysis of the data identi ed a yet unreported suggestive locus at chromosome 16p12.1 ( p-value of the lead SNV: 4.17\u00d710-07). This association was replicated in two of three patient/control replication series (Central European and Yemeni). The lead SNV rs56383345 maps to a 930 kb non-coding region at 16p12.1, and is not located in any currently known regulatory element. Gene-based analysis of the GWAS data prioritized SH3PXD2A at chromosome 10q24.33 as a candidate gene for nsCL/P. To date, support for this gene as a cleft gene has been restricted to data from zebra sh and a knockout mouse model. The present GWAS is the rst to implicate SH3PXD2A in non-syndromic cleft formation in humans. In summary, although performed in a relatively small sample, the present GWAS generated novel insightsinto nsCL/P etiology, and demonstrates how medium-sized, clinically well characterized GWAS samples can improve knowledge of the genetic basis of nsCL/P.

Ludwig1 1Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany, 2FASTGenomics, Comma Soft AG, Bonn, Germany Molecular defects during craniofacial embryonic develop- ment may result in nonsyndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P), one of the most common birth defects.Despite the possibility of surgical correction, follow-up treatment is long-term and requires an interdisciplinary approach. Also, epidemiological data indicate that indivi-duals with nsCL/P show an increased risk for morbidities and suffer from a considerable psycho-social burden.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 247The molecular pathways underlying these observations are currently unknown. We here used nsCL/P-GWAS data and array-based expression data from embryonic mice (gesta- days E10.5-E12.5, et. al 2017), to identify pathways in which nsCL/P candidate genes are enriched. The 45 nsCL/P risk loci comprise ~400 genes within theirtopologically associated domains. Using gene-based ana- lysis, we identi ed 86 genes with enrichment of common variants, suggesting their involvement in nsCL/P etiology.For each of these genes, we analyzed the expression pattern in ectodermal or mesodermal tissues of and hier-archical clustering. One of the three clusters we identi ed comprised 33 genes, including established nsCL/P-genes likeIRF6 andTFAP2a . A pathway analysis of genes within this cluster revealed a signi cant overrepresentation of cancer-related pathways and processes related to molecular signaling. Interestingly, affecteds with nsCL/P have beenreported to be at increased risk of cancer. We will next extend our approach at single-cell level, using systematic data as recently provided (Cao et. al 2019) and the analy-tical ecosystem FASTGenomics (Scholz et. al 2018). This will generate novel insights into gene regulatory networks across development, and their contribution to nsCL/P. A. Siewert: None. B. Reiz: A. Employment (full time); cant; Comma Soft AG.

It is often clinically impossible to predict the underlying causative gene,248 J. del Picchiathus necessitating broad multi-gene panel testing or exome sequencing. We report on ve independent families with a progressively-deforming type of OI with the distinguishing feature of oligodontia. We identi ed four homozygous trun- cation or frameshift mutations in a novel namely MESD. MESD encodes receptors Because complete absence of MESD causes embryoniclethality in mice, we hypothesized that the OI-associated mutations are hypomorphic alleles since these mutations occur downstream of the chaperone activity domain butupstream of ER-retention domain. This would be consistent with the clinical phenotypes of skeletal fragility and oligo- dontia in persons de cient for LRP5 and LRP6, respectively. Further functional analysis showed that OI-associated MESD mutations produce hypomorphic alleles whose failure to remain within the ER signi cantly reduces but does not completely eliminate LRP5 and LRP6 traf cking. Since these individuals have no eye abnormalities (which occur in indi- viduals completely lacking LRP5) and have neither limb norbrain patterning defects (both of which occur in mice com- pletely lacking LRP6), we infer that bone mass accrual and dental patterning are more sensitive to reduced canonicalWNT signaling than are other developmental processes. Multigene panels do not yet include MESD. Therefore, if an undiagnosed patient with severe OI and oligodontia presents,it may be prudent to think rst of MESD. S. Moosa: None. G.L. Yamamoto: None. L.

An iliac crest bone biopsyrevealed an elevated trabecular density (BV/TV [%] 32.2 vs. 21.5 +14.8) and the presence of hypermineralized cartilage remnants leading to an overall increase in miner-alization (CaMean [wt%] 25.65 vs. 21.8). We also found large multinucleated osteoclasts with abnormal morphology and inadequate bone resorption. Although these ndings were reminiscent of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type 2, no mutations in CLCN7 were detected. Subsequent whole exome sequencing identi ed the novel homozygous the gene LRRK1 . cDNA sequencing showed nearly complete skipping of exon 3 leading to a frameshift (p.Ala34Profs*33), very likelyleading to a loss of function. LRRK1 encodes a protein kinase and OMIM # 615198). from the patient 's peripheral blood monocytes formed quickly and became unusually large. In resorption assays these cells formed large areas withsuper cial pseudo-resorption but excavated only few resorption pits (resorption pit surface surface [%] 1.3 +0.6 vs. 15+3.6; p < 0.01). Phosphorylation of was reduced in patient-derived osteoclasts, thus corro- borating a LRRK1 loss of function (0.26 +0.1 vs. 1 + 0.08; p < 0.01). Our analysis indicates a strong overlap ofLRRK1 -related OSMD with other late-onset forms of osteopetrosis, but exceptionally leaky osteoclast resorption. A. Howaldt: None. A. Hennig: None. T.

Willaert Center for Medical Genetics, Gent, Belgium Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) is an auto- somal recessive disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and strength, caused by loss-of-function mutations inAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 249LRP5 co-receptor in the WNT signaling pathway. Here we describe the rst reliable genetically induced form of osteoporosis in the zebra sh in a lrp5 knockout (KO). Molecular analysis con rmed reduced lrp5 transcripts and absence of Lpr5 protein. Reduced survival was observed inlrp5 KO larvae after the onset of mineralization. The frac- tion of larvae that did survive, displayed delayed ossi ca- tion as was shown via mineral staining. Subsequently, thesesh were grown to adulthood and analyzed via CT. This revealed decreased bone volume and decreased bone mineralization in the vertebral column, which are hallmarkfeatures of osteoporosis. Next, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis targeted at lrp5 followed by Miseq sequencingof mosaic larvae revealed out-of-frame mutations in on average 90% of the reads. Consequently, we showed a similar skeletal phenotype in the F0 'crispants 'to that of the stable lrp5 -/-larvae, showing that crispant screening in zebra sh is a promising approach to functionally screen a large set of osteoporosis candidate genes. In summary, wepresent lrp5 /zebra sh as the rst genetic osteoporosis zebra sh model that can be used as a screening platform for potential therapeutics. Additionally, we show that F0 cris-pant screening can be used for functional validation of candidate genes for osteoporosis as high rates of out-of- frame mutations in the lrp5 gene are suf cient to induce phenotypes.

P04.64.A The p.R321C mutation in p62 protein, associated to Paget 's Disease of Bone, leads to a relocation of the protein in human osteoclasts N. Gestoso-Uzal 1,2, R. Usategui-Mart\u00edn1,2, of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain,2Molecular Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, 3Rheumatology Service, University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain,4Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer (IBMCC), University of Salamanca- CSIC, Salamanca, Spain Background: The most important known genetic factor predisposing to Paget\u00b4s disease of bone (PDB) is mutation inSQSTM1 gene, which encodes p62 protein. We detected the c.961C>T SQSTM1 gene mutation in three PDB patients, that causes the p.R321C mutation. It has beenreported that p.R321C mutation causes a blockade of autophagy and an activation of NF-kB pathway. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of the p.R321C mutation in human osteoclasts. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood samples for generating humanosteoclasts. Cells were differentiated by adding M-CSF and RANKL for 3 weeks. Human osteoclasts were transiently with total plasmid DNA (pCEFL-Flag-SQSTM1-321C Finally, we performed a co-immuno fluorescence assay to detect Flag and p62. Results and discussion: Our results showed that, while 321R-p62 protein remained scattered though the cytoplasm, 321C-p62 was concentrated in the periphery of osteoclasts.This relocation of p62 protein caused by p.R321C mutation could be a consequence of autophagy blockade, which has been reported that could have a crucial role in the etiologyof PDB. The p.R321C mutation causes a blockade of autophagy and an activation of NF-kB pathway, therefore the alteration of the cell metabolism could be the cause ofthe relocation of p62 protein in human osteoclasts. Conclusion: The p.R321C mutation in p62 protein leads to a relocation of the protein in human osteoclasts. Thisreinforces the hypothesis that an alteration of autophagy could be involved in PDB etiology. This work was supported by FIS-FEDER:PI16/01920.N. Gestoso-Uzal: Usategui-Mart\u00edn: None. C.

Stephan2 1Institute of Medical Genetics and Human Genetics, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin, Berlin, Germany,2Sana Chil- dren\u00b4s Hospital Lichtenberg, Berlin, Germany Introduction: Penttinen syndrome belongs to the group of progeroid disorders and is characterized by progressivesubcutaneous lipoatrophy, sclerotic skin lesions and acro- osteolysis. This very rare condition is caused by a few distinct missense mutations of PDGFRB , other distinct mutations of this gene have been shown to be associated with different conditions such as infantile myo bromatosis. Material and Methods: Here, we describe a 5-year-old male patient with infantile myo bromatosis diagnosed in hisrst month of life who in addition developed a250 J. del Picchiaprematurely aged appearance with lipoatrophy, scar-like skin nodules on the hands and joint contractures. Results: Sanger sequencing revealed the heterozygous de novo mutation c.1997A>G; p.Asn666Ser in the PDGFRB gene. Recently, this mutation has been described in two patients affected with a severe form of Penttinen syndromepresenting a more pronounced connective tissue destruction. Conclusions: This is the rst report of an individual affected with both conditions, infantile myo bromatosis and Penttinen syndrome. This mutation lead to increased phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins such asPTPN11. Imatinib is a strong inhibitor of phosphorylation of these targets representing a treatment option. D.

MicroRNAs act tissue speci - cally but some are secreted into blood. Recent studies reported upregulation of speci c miRNAs in the in flamed oral mucosa of periodontitis patients. The regulatory targets of these miRNAs may reveal genes that are conducive to oral health. If secreted into blood, these miRNAs couldserve as biomarkers to diagnose periodontitis before clinical manifestation. To identify such miRNAs, we quanti ed 863 miRNAs in the blood of 18 periodontitis patients and 70periodontitis-free controls (Geniom in blood of periodontitis cases (P adjusted < 5x10 6). Two previous studies that pro led microRNAs in the inflamed and healthy oral mucosa independently reported upregulation 3 technical and quanti ed the mRNA levels in mock-transfected (Fold Change =-1.8, P=0.00025). Two binding sites of hsa-miR-374b-5p were predicted at the 3'UTR of UHMK1 . To validate the functional mechanism, we cloned the respective 3 'UTR of UHMK1 into a reporter plasmid (pGL4.24, Promega). of the plasmid and hsa-miR-374b-5p mimic into HeLa cells for 24 hours, the reporter gene expression was signi cantly reduced (Fold Change =-1.5, p =0.02, 3 independent replicates).

P04.70.A POP1 -Skeletal Dysplasias J. HARVENGT , S. ALKAN, POP1 mutations should be considered in anauxetic dysplasia (AD) patients without RMRP mutations but also in skeletal dysplasia (SD) of different severities. To date, only 5 patients were reported. Methods: Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia (CHH) was sus- pected in two siblings based on clinical and radiological evaluation. In family 1, a 4 years boy was investigated. His older sister is also affected by SD but currently refuses topursue genetic testing. In family 2, two sisters presented a severe short stature : the older has 120 cm as nal adult height. The second aged of 13 also suffered from animmune de ciency. Results: A skeletal dysplasia gene panel revealed in the N\u00b01 : composite heterozygous and c.1747G>T, class inherited). Family N\u00b02 : a homozygous variant c.632G>A, class 4. Discussion :POP1 patients are characterized by severe short stature of prenatal-onset and very short adult height (classically less than 1 meter, but our adult patients were120 cm and near 160 cm), hypodontia, midface hypoplasia, mild intellectual disability and radiological speci cndings including systematic bullet-shaped middle phalanges.Notably, none of the 5 published cases were reported with immune de ciency.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 251Conclusions: We describe two new families with POP1 mutations encountered in patients clinically suspected for CHH and achondroplasia, enhancing that the phenotypical spectrum is larger than AD type 2.

Madrid, Spain Roifman Syndrome (RS, OMIM 300258) is a rare disorder characterized by pre- and postnatal growth retardation,cognitive delay, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, antibody deciency and facial dysmorphism. Biallelic mutations in RNU4ATAC have been reported as the molecular cause. Our series expand the phenotypic spectrum of Roifman patients. We report four patients from three unrelated families with RS. Due to the complexity of variant annotation inRNU4ATAC , molecular studies are not usually straightfor- ward. Indeed, in families 1 and 2 exome sequencing was inconclusive. In patient 1 the diagnosis was nally uncov- ered by genome sequencing, in sisters 2 and 3 by Sanger sequencing upon clinical suspicion and in patient 4 by a customized gene panel. Main clinical characteristics includeskeletal dysplasia (4/4), short stature (4/4), intellectual dis- ability (4/4), antibody de ciency (3/4) and retinal dystrophy (2/4). Main dysmorphic features included markedly longphiltrum and thin upper lip. Hepatomegaly was identi ed in 2/4 and patient 1 presented hepatic cavernoma (unreported so far in Roifamn patients). Molecular results var-iants n.8C>T 1); variant n.13C>T and (sisters and 3) and two novel variants, n.37G>A and n.53C>T (patient 4).

Reis1, Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany The primary cilium is an organelle, which is present on almost all vertebrate cells. Cilia consist of the axoneme and the basal body and present various ciliary membrane receptors, which receive extracellular signals. Those signalsare transmitted into the cell, where they modulate different intracellular signaling pathways. Mutations in ciliary pro- teins are involved in formation, maintenance and functionof the primary cilium and associated with developmental defects, like brain malformations, polydactyly, kidney cysts and skeletal abnormalities. This patients with short-rib polydactyly syn- dromes autosomal recessive osteochondrodysplasias. Diallelic mutations in NEK1, encoding for a basal body protein, are the underlying cause of SRPS II. To gain further insight into the pathogenic mechanism, we used twoapproaches: RNA sequencing of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genomic edited HEK293T cells and scRNASeq in limb buds of E13 embryos of the Nek1 knock down mouse, andrespectively compared the knock out and the wildtype in order to nd differentially expressed genes. Analysis of signicantly enriched pathways revealed an activation of genes in early growth response and cell cycle control and silencing of different collagens and ribosomal and histone proteins. One of the main ndings was a severely reduced expression of Acan, coding for Aggrecan the most abundant cartilaginous protein, explaining the severe growth phenotype. These results underline that the NEK1 associated defect of the primary cilium causes the de ciency in cell cycle and gene expression, mainly aggrecan, in the growth plate.C. Vogl: None. K.

Perez de Nanclares2 1Rare Diseases Research Group, Molecular (Epi)Genetics Laboratory, BioAraba National Health Research Institute, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain,2Rare Diseases Research Group, Molecular (Epi)Genetics Laboratory, BioAraba Institute, Vitoria-Gasteiz, Araba, Spain, Araba, Spain Introduction: Silver-Russell syndrome is a rare imprinting disorder characterized by prenatal (SGA) and postnatal growth retardation (PNGR), relative macrocephaly at birth,a prominent forehead, body asymmetry and feeding dif - culties and/or low BMI. The most common underlying mechanisms are hypomethylation at H19/IGF2: IG-DMR and UPD(7)mat. Rarely, or paternal IGF2 variants). Recently PLAG1 and HMGA2 genes, which participate in the IGF2 pathway, have been associated with this syndrome. Patients and Methods: We present a 9 years-old girl who was initially referred to pediatric endocrinology because of short stature. A clinical geneticist suggested the clinical diagnosis of SRS (NHC score =4: SGA, PNGR, prominent forehead and problems for feeding manifested as poor food intake). She also showed dental crowding with delayed teeth eruption, triangular face, small and bulbousnose, prominent maxillary, high ojival palate, ne voice, ne hair and learning dif culties. Her mother and maternal grandmother presented the same phenotype. After discard-ing alterations in 11p15 and chromosome 7 (MS-MLPA), a custom NGS panel for genes associated with growth was run. Results: The study of the NGS panel revealed an heterozygous novel variant within exon 5 of PLAG1 [NM_001114634.2:c.551delA; p.(Lys184Serfs*45)], bioin-formatically predicted as likely pathogenic (ACMG: PVS1;Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive We report the second familial case of SRS caused by a novel PLAG1 frameshift alteration, and we expand the clinical spectrum to the previously described.

Skeletal ciliopathies are a heterogenous group of disorders with overlapping features, caused by patho- genic variants in at least 30 genes, coding for different structural cilia proteins. Materials and Methods: We examined 28 probands with radiographic ndings of skeletal ciliopathies. For single nucleotide (SNV) analysis, we used whole and genome sequencing with in silico ltering genes. Results: splice variants showed that cDNA analyses are important in facilitating molecular diagnoses in a signi cant proportion (20%) of the patients and that aberrant splicing in DYNC2H1 ,EVC and KIAA0753 can be con rmed with RNA extracted from blood. Copy number variant (CNV)analyses was performed for the same cohort and we found one individual with an intragenic deletion of DYNC2H1 and another with 1q24q25-microdeletion syndrome. Conclusions: In conclusion, combined SNV, CNV and RNA analyses result in a high yield of genetic diagnoses (86%) in a cohort of patients with a clinical, autopsy andradiological ndings consistent with skeletal and AN - Stockholm County Council.

TANGO1 binds collagen in the lumen, COPII-coats in the cytoplasm and recruits membranes from the ERGIC (ER-Golgi inter- mediate compartment) to create an export route for bulky cargos like collagen. Recently aberrant expression of trun- cated TANGO1 was linked to a severe collagenopathyassociated with primary obesity, diabetes mellitus and intellectual disability. We show that complete loss of TANGO1 results in human embryonic lethality with near-total bone loss. Material and Methods: Fetal DNA and parental blood/ broblast samples were obtained. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was Western blot, and collagen secretion assays were conducted. Results: Ultrasound examination of a 13-weeks-old fetus of healthy Indian consanguineous parents revealed tetra- micromelia, increased nuchal translucency, absent nasalbone, pingpong appearance of the skull, shortened limb segments, and extreme skeletal hypomineralization. The pregnancy was terminated and the infantogram showed analmost boneless fetus. Fetal WES detected a homozygous 4- basepair deletion in TANGO1 , heterozygously present in both parents. Parental broblast studies demonstrated decreased TANGO1 expression and protein, and severe defects in collagen secretion. Conclusions: Ourndings underscore the importance of TANGO1 in cellular protein secretion. While absence of TANGO1 results in human embryonic lethality, aberrant expression of truncated TANGO1 results in a severecollagenopathy. This further supports the physiological role of TANGO1 in collagen export, which is necessary for bone mineralization, skin and tissue biogenesis. Moreover, thedata clearly reveal the severity of human pathologies in association with levels of functional TANGO1 expression. B. Guillemyn: None. S. Nampoothiri: None. O. Foresti: None. I.

It is caused by bi-allelic variants of RBM8A gene (1q21.1) with the association of allele and a hypo-morphic non-coding variant. RBM8A encodes Y14, a core protein of the Exon Junction Complex involved in mRNA maturation. To date, only two hypomorphic variants havebeen identi ed. We report on a cohort of 26 patients affected with TAR syndrome. Half patients carried a 1q21.1 deletion and one of the two known hypomorphic variants.Four novel non-coding variants of RBM8A were identi ed in the remaining patients. We developed experimentalAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 255models enabling their functional characterization in vitro. Two variants, located respectively in the 5 '-UTR and 3 '- UTR regions, are responsible for a diminished expression whereas two intronic variants alter splicing.

IJpma, Heijsman, J. W. Roos- Hesselink, H. J. M. Verhagen, S. ten Raa, R. M. W. Hofstra, D. F. Majoor-Krakauer Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands Relatives of abdominal aneurysm patients (AAA) have an increased risk of developing aneurysms. To improve early detection and reduce risk of rupture in relatives, guidelinesrecommend screening of rst degree relatives. Current guidelines do not specify the method or extend of aorta screening in relatives. In practice, mostly male relatives arereferred for abdominal echographic screening of the abdominal aorta, possibly missing thoracic aneurysms (TAA) in relatives. To determine in which part of the aortaaffected relatives of AAA patients have an aneurysm or dilatation, we reviewed the results of family history taking and family screening of families of 471 AAA patients withfamilial aneurysms of which medical records and/or CT images relatives were available. In total 475 affected rela- tives (311 male, 164 female) in 237 families had an aortadilatation or aneurysm: 258 (54,3%) had abdominal and 147 (31%) thoracic aneurysm. Male relatives were more likely to have AAA (40% vs 28%, p < 0.05), females to have TAA(32% vs 17%, p < 0.05). Co-occurrence of AAA and TAA was observed in 7% of relatives. In 17% an iliac and in 2% a popliteal dilation occurred. In conclusion: relatives ofAAA patients have an increased risk for dilatation of the abdominal and the thoracic aorta. To preventunderdiagnosis of aortic aneurysm in relatives and improve early detection of aortic aneurysms, a CT-scan of the total aorta and the iliac arteries should be considered as the method of choice for family screening.

Hofstra, D. F. Majoor-Krakauer Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands A growing number of genes are associated with risk for aortic aneurysms. Similar mechanisms of remodeling of the extracellular matrix in fluencing the integrity of the aortic wall may play a role in abdominal and thoracic aneurysms. This helps to explain co-occurrence of AAA and TAA (25%), relatives with AAA in familial TAA and relativeswith TAA in familial AAA. To establish the role of aneurysm genes in AAA, the yield of diagnostic whole exome sequencing (WES) of a panel ofaneurysm genes in AAA patients is presented. As part of an ongoing genetic AAA study consecutively diagnosed patients at the department of Vascular Surgerywere invited for genetic counseling. In this way WES DNA testing was performed in 858 AAA patients (738 unique families, 345 with familial AAA). A pathogenic (PV) variant occurred in 20 (3%) AAA index cases and 7 family members and 301 AAA patients (41%) had a variant of unknown clinical signi no difference between familial and sporadic AAA in the WES yield. The outcome was comparable to that found in thoracic aneurysm patients. The conclusion is that DNA diagnostics may improve stratication of familial risk for aortic aneurysms and distinguish relatives who bene t most from close surveillance.

Exome sequencing and data repository (CentoMD \u00ae) analyses were performed to identify patients with ADAMTS19 variants (two families). A third family was recognized based on cardiac phenotypic similarities andSNP array homozygosity. Three novel loss of function (LoF) variants were identi ed in six patients from three families. Clinically, all patients presented anomalies of theaortic/pulmonary valves, which included thickening of valve lea flets, stenosis and insuf ciency. Three patientshad (recurrent) subaortic membrane, suggesting that ADAMTS19 is the rst gene identi ed related to discrete subaortic stenosis. In contrast to previous publication, none of these patients were reported as having a bicuspid aortic valve. However, one case presented a bi-commissural pulmonary valve. All patients displayed some degree ofatrioventricular valve insuf ciency. Other cardiac anomalies included atrial/ventricular arteriosus, and mild dilated ndings that biallelic LoF variants in ADAMTS19 are causative of a speci c and recognizable cardiac phenotype. We recommend consideringADAMTS19 genetic testing in all patients with multiple semilunar valve abnormalities, particularly in the presence of subaortic membrane. ADAMTS19 screening in patients with semilunar valve abnormalities is needed to estimate the frequency of the HVD related phenotype, which might be not so rare. S. Massadeh: None. A. AlHashem: None.

Pulmonaryartery stenosis, present in two thirds of AGS patients, is considered as a hallmark of the condition. Other vascularAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 257anomalies are identi ed in up to 10% of AGS patients. We describe a unique family with a JAG1 missense variant that segregates with a wide range of cardiovascular anomalies. Whole exome sequencing in a fetus with left hypoplastic heart and left renal agenesis revealed a missense variant (c.2242T>C; p.Cys748Arg) in JAG1 , which was absent from gnomAD, predicted likely pathogenic by prediction programs and maternally inherited. The mother underwent surgery for aortic coarctation at age 10. The JAG1 variant was present in the mother 's monozygotic twin-sister and brother but absent in another sister. Subsequent familial clinical evaluation revealed normal eye exam (no embry-otoxon), normal ultrasound of kidneys and absence of hemivertebrae in all mutation carriers. Echocardiographic evaluation revealed a normal aorta in the mother, borderlineaortic dilatation (40 mm) in her monozygotic twin-sister and a huge aortic sinus aneurysm (58 mm) in the brother. The brother also has scoliosis. Remarkably, in literature anotherJAG1 variant affecting a Cys-residu has been linked to severe congenital heart disease (Tetralogy of Fallot). Aortic aneurysm was previously reported in four patients, three ofwhich were only diagnosed on autopsy after fatal dissection. Our family data warrant regular echocardiographic follow- up in JAG1 mutation carriers as severe aortic aneurysms remain asymptomatic and predispose to fatal aortic dissection. I. Van Gucht: None.

The purpose of this retrospective multi- center study was to review the clinical and genetic data of 47 new individuals with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic ACTA2 variant and elucidate the clinical outcome of ACTA2 -related vasculopathies. Material and Methods: Index patients and relatives with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the ACTA2 gene were included in this study. Data were collected through retrospective review of available medical records using astandardized questionnaire. Results: Forty-seven individuals from 26 families participated in our study. Mean age at last evaluation was50.8 \u00b1 17.0 years. A total of 21 different ACTA2 variants were detected in our cohort, including 19 missense variants, 1 splice site variant and 1 frameshift variant. Four variantsare novel. Aortic events occurred in 30/47 (63.8%) of patients. Mean age at rst aortic event was 55.6 \u00b1 13.7 years. Male gender and the presence of hypertensionemerged as signi cant predictors of aortic events. Men were also at higher risk of aortic aneurysms compared to women. Other clinical ndings included congenital heart disease in 6/47 and iris flocculi in 6/47. Conclusions: We provide further into the genotype and phenotype of ACTA2 -related vasculopathies. Male gender and hypertension are predisposing factors for aortic events in individuals with a pathogenic ACTA2 variant.

Abouelhoda1,2 1Department of Genetics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,2Saudi Human Genome Program, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,3Heart center, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh,Saudi Arabia, 4Al-Faisal University, College of Medicine, Afliate Harvard Medical School International, Riyadh,258 J. del PicchiaSaudi Arabia,5CHU, Limoges, France,6Pzer Inc, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Introduction: Amyloidosis is a rare, frequently under- diagnosed systemic disease due to protein deposition that develops when a native protein misfolds into insolubleamyloid brils. These bril deposits alter function of most affected organs, including the myocardium. Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is one of the two main causes ofcardiac amyloidosis and occurs as a result of mutations in TTR. Under or misdiagnosis of affected individuals and incomplete penetrance make estimates of prevalence chal-lenging. While worldwide prevalence is estimated to be around 50,000 individuals, with TTR V142I being the most common cardiac ATTR associated mutation, no data onTTR mutations or their frequency in Middle Eastern coun- tries are available to date. Materials and Methods: Blinded from clinical informa- tion, we undertook data mining of 13,906 exomes of unrelated Saudi individuals, sequenced between 2015 and 2019 as part of the Saudi Human Genome Project (SHGP).Pathogenic or highly pathogenic TTR variants were identi ed following ltration to remove common, synon- ymous, non-coding identi edseven missense variants (known or predicted pathogenic) in TTR, three of which have been previously reported in amyloidosispatients worldwide. The most frequent variants were c.424G>A:p.V142I (1:435) and c.370C>T:p.R124C (1:2,318). Prevalence of TTR variants in the general Saudi population was much higher than the actual estimated rate of ATTR cases nationally (1:10,000), which may be explained by incomplete penetrance or sub-clinical mani-festation of the disease.

Webb1,2 Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Leicester, United Biomedical Research Centre, Leicester, United Kingdom, Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, Background: Bicuspid Aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital present in around 1% of thepopulation. Familial BAV has an autosomal dominant pat- tern of inheritance with reduced penetrance, however, the majority of BAV cases are sporadic. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic NOTCH1 variants have been reported in famil- ial, as well as up to 4% of sporadic cases. Aim: To investigate the frequency of causative NOTCH1 mutations in a large cohort of patients of sporadic and familial BAV disease recruited to the Bicuspid aoRtic vAlVe gEnetic research (BRAVE) study. Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was per- formed in 12 families (30 affected and 25 unaffected family members). Targeted NOTCH1 sequencing was carried out in 383 sporadic BAV cases. variants were ltered by gnomAD allele frequency deleterious effect (Combined Annotation Dependent Deple-tion (CADD) score>20). We also compared cumulative frequency of rare NOTCH1 variants between sporadic BAV patients and 1102 apparently healthy controls. Results: One BAV family had a truncating NOTCH1 variant (c.873C>G/p.Tyr291*). There were no candidate NOTCH1 variants in any of the other 11 families. We identi ed seven rare and potentially deleterious NOTCH1 variants in the sporadic patient group. Among which, there were no protein truncating mutations. There was noenrichment of NOTCH1 variants controls (1.83% vs 3.09%, p-value 0.18). Conclusions: Our data suggest that whilst occasionally responsible for familial cases of BAV, NOTCH1 mutations are an infrequent cause of sporadic forms of the disease. S.E. Hamby: None. R.

Macek, Jr.1 1Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol, Prague, Czech Republic,2Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic Aim: Analysis of the genetic basis in a representative cohort of Czech patients with familiar bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)with / without aortic aneurysm (MIM# 109730). Materials and Methods: Altogether 100 unrelated cases were clinically examined, underwent genetic counsellingand positive cases were subjected to \"cascade screening \"of rst-degree relatives. Massively parallel sequencing (MiSeqAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 259platform; Illumina.com) was utilised for a panel comprising either 136, 229 or 100 cardiac/aortic conditions-related candidate genes (Sophia Genetics.com). Presence of pathogenic variants was validated by Sanger sequencing and via their segregation in respective families. Results: Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (ACMG Class 4) were found in 3/100 patients (3 %) within TGFB2, SMAD6 and FBN1 . Variants of unknown sig- nicance (Class 3) were detected in 9/100 patients (9 genes FLNA, FBN1, MYH11, not co-segregate with BAV. Conclusions: The yield of genetic testing in familial forms of BAV is rather low in our cohort. Moreover, the identi cation of pathogenic variant in BAV-related gene is not a guarantee of their causality, hence detected variants should be carefully interpreted. The genetic basis for the familial forms of BAV will be further studied, e.g. by wholeexome analysis together with improved clinical strati ca- tion of our patient cohort.

Alaerts1 1Centre of Medical Genetics, faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Antwerp & Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium,2Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, Physiology & Pharmacology,Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium, 3Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical SCN5A encodes of channel Na v1.5. Mutations in SCN5A are identi ed in about 20% of patients with syn- drome (BrS), an inherited founder mutation (c.4813 +3_4813 leading to a loss-of-function of Na v1.5 in 25different families. Mutation carriers show variable expres- sion of the phenotype: from asymptomatic to syncopes and SCD. We used induced pluripotent stem cell derived car- diomyocytes (iPSC-CM) to investigate the underlying pathophysiology. Material & Methods: Dermal broblasts of three patients with different severity, and one unrelated healthy control were reprogrammed using the CytoTune -iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit. iPSC-CMs were differentiatedfollowing a published protocol. T3 hormone addition was tested to improve maturity of the cells. We performed several differentiation rounds and investigated expression ofcardiac markers using qPCR and immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological properties using patch-clamping and calcium imaging. Results: All iPSC-CMs expressed tested markers. We observed reduction in sodium current density in patient iPSC-CMs, together with shortening of the action potentialand calcium transient duration compared to the control. However, our data display variability between the differ- entiation batches, as well as between clones generated fromone donor. Addition of T3 improved organization of the sarcomeres and decreased result variability. Conclusions: We established iPSC-CM models for a unique Belgian SCN5A founder mutation. Despite observed variability, we could detect expected differences in electro- physiological properties of patient cells compared tocontrols. We prove that T3 addition improves the maturity of the cells, with a positive impact on the variability. E. Simons: None. A. Nijak: None. B. Vandendriessche: None. D. Van de Sande: None. E.

SHOX2 has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial brillation (AF) and sinus node dysfunction. Yet, our knowledge on co-regulatory networks associated with car- diac rhythm control in health and disease still remains limited. To dissect the role of Shox2-dependent networks,we utilized a murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) model that allowed us to investigate molecular pathways involving Shox2 in SAN-like cardiomyocytes. Differential RNA-seq-based expression pro ling of Shox2 +/+andShox2-/-ESCs revealed 94 regulated transcripts in Shox2-/-SAN-like cells. Fifteen putative target genes were selected for furthervalidation based on comparative expression analysis of our dataset with publicly available RNA-seq data of SAN and right atria enriched genes at different mouse embryonicstages. Network-based analyses integrating data from the Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas and the Ingenuity pathway analysis tool as well as validation in mouse and zebra sh conrmed a species conserved regulation for Shox2 target genes in cardiac rhythm control. Our results indicate that co-regulatory networks involving SHOX2 participate in thedevelopment of conduction traits through regulatory mechanisms, thereby affecting the expression of multiple genes.

In this study we examined the diagnostic yield of targeted gene panels compared to whole exome data analysis. Methods: The cohort consisted of 61 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or primary arrhythmia syndrome, with DCM being the most common diagnosis.The genetic analysis involved whole exome sequencing with subsequent stepwise bioinformatic analysis starting from virtual gene panels till whole exome data. Geneticvariants were classi ed according to ACMG-criteria. Results: Overall, in 39 out of 61 (64%) patients a variant of interest was detected. The detection rate was highest inpatients with a diagnosis of HCM (7/9; 77%) or DCM (25/ 36; 69%). In DCM the diagnostic yield was better compared to current literature. The majority of variants of interestwere found in the disease-speci c panel (46%; 28/61), while the further analysis of an extended panel and whole exome data led to an additional diagnostic yield of 13% and5%, respectively. Whole exome data analysis also detected variants in thus far not well characterized candidate genes whose expression and function pro le suggested a probable pathogenetic role. Conclusions: Targeted gene panel analysis led to the identi cation of the genetic cause in the majority of solved cases. The additional diagnostic yield of whole exome data analysis was low, enabled though the detection of potentially causal variants in candidate genes. K. Kolokotronis: None. N. Pluta: None. E.

Furthermore,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 261the additional diagnostic value of a larger panel of heart disease-associated genes was assessed. Methods: This study included a large population of ~2000 patients suspected of a heritable cardiac condition who underwent cardiogenetic testing at the laboratory of the Clinical Genetics Department in Maastricht. Sequencing adiagnostic panel of 46 cardiomyopathy genes and/or 27 arrhythmia genes was performed using single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs). For 347 of thesepatients, whole exome sequencing was performed for the analysis of a panel of 350 heart disease-associated genes. Results: A (likely) pathogenic variant was found in 20% (336/1719) and 8% (34/408) of patients tested for the cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia gene panel, respectively. The majority of these variants were found in the MYBPC3, MYH7, arrhythmia. larger panel of 350genes in 347 patients identi ed an additional pathogenic variant explaining the clinical phenotype in only 3 patients. Conclusions: Our data support parallel sequencing of core genes as the preferred strategy for genetic testing of patients suspected of having a genetic cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia. The incremental diagnostic yield of a largerpanel of heart disease-associated genes is minimal. There- fore, focus should not be on analysing more genes, but on developing functional assays to predict pathogenicity ofvariants of unknown signi cance (VUS 's) in the core panel genes. D.M.E.I.

Carvajal syndrome is a rare recessive form of ACM asso-ciated with woolly hair and palmo-plantar keratoderma and pathogenic variants in the desmoplakin (DSP) gene. Some families have been described with a dominantly inheritedDSP variant with features of Carvajal. Materials and Methods: In a four generation family seggregation analysis was done for a dominantly inheritedDSP p.R1113* variant. The phenotypes are described and the results are compared to literature. Results: In the large sibship (4M +8F) at least three siblings are obligate carrying the DSP pathogenic variant and have offspring with cardiac abnormalities. Five family members died suddenly, 2/5 obligate carriers, 3/5 the statusis unknown. The curly hair is co-seggregating with the variant. Not all carriers have keratoderma. A number of individuals with the variant have no cardiac complaints sofar, cardiological investigations are planned. An overview will be presented at the conference and compared to the six families described by Maruthappu et al in 2019, one ofthese families also has the p.R1113* variant. Conclusion: The p.R1113* variant in the DSP gene leads to a well recognizable phenotype of mild Carvajalsyndrome. Drawing the attention to this phenotype by presenting this large four generation family may help in identifying other families with this disease and in prevent-ing sudden death. A.T.J.M.

Materials and Methods: Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of 22q11 CNVs in Hungarian CHD patients. 175blood samples were obtained from children and adults with different isolated and combined CHDs. Samples were analyzed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli-cation (MLPA) to detect CNVs in the given chromosomal region. Positive MLPA results were con rmed with locus- specic FISH. Genotype-phenotype comparison and family screening was also performed. Results: CNVs were detected in overall 10 cases (5.7%). Six cases with typical microdeletion (between LCRs A andD) also known as DiGeorge syndrome, 2 cases with microduplication and 2 cases with combined microdeletion and microduplication were detected. The phenotypicalappearance of patients was highly variable. CNVs were familiar in 3 cases. Conclusions: Until present this was the largest systemic genetic screening of Hungarian CHD patients. Since the clinical diagnosis of 22q11 microdeletion/microduplication syndrome may be challenging due to its variable manifesta-tion, systematic genetic testing may be of utmost bene ti n the early diagnosis and proper management of these patients.

Con-genital heart disease shows a high degree of heritability but the genetic causes are still poorly understood. The 100,000 Genomes Project provides whole genome sequences for patients with rare disease or cancer and their families. Over 600 participants were recruited to the projectunder the congenital heart disease arm of the project, almost all of whom have no known causative variant. In addition, analysis of phenotyping and clinical data identi ed an additional ~2,500 participants with congenital heart disease who were recruited to the project for other conditions. We will present rare, likely pathogenic single nucleotide, short insertions/deletions and structural variants, both transmitted and de novo, from this cohort of 3,100 participants with congenital heart disease. Short variantsareltered for variants with moderate or high impact on protein function; CADD (combined annotation dependent depletion) score 20; and absent in gnomAD v3. This research was made possible through access to the data and ndings generated by the 100,000 spectrum of congenital heart disease in 73consanguineous Turkish families W. Dong 1, H. Kaymakcalan2, N. Diab1, S. Chih Jin1, C. Istanbul, Turkey,3Mehmet Akif Ersoy Hospital, istanbul, Turkey Mutation spectrum of congenital heart disease in 73 con- sanguineous Turkish families Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most frequent defect among live births and the leading cause of mortality from a birth defect. Nearly 90% of CHDcases have a suspected genetic etiology, but in 56% of cases the genetic etiology is unknown. Few gene discovery efforts have been made with consanguineous CHD cohorts. Werecruited 74 CHD patients from 73 consanguineous families in Turkey and used whole exome sequencing to identify affected genes in these patients. In 13.7% of the cohort, wecould identify a genetic etiology and we discovered four new genes that are putatively causative for CHD. This represents an important advance in our understanding of thegenetic consequences of consanguinity in CHD. Materials and methods: 74 samples from 73 families were recruited from two pediatric cardiology clinics inIstanbul, Turkey. Cardiac phenotypes were classi ed into 5 major categories and whole exome sequencing was performed at the Yale Center for Genomic Analysis usingIllumina.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 263Result: 7 out of 73 (9.6%) patients carried damaging homozygous variants in known CHD genes and 3 out of 73 (4.1%) of them harbored other types of CHD-related genomic alterations, which explained 13.7% of the cohort. Conclusions: Ourndings is consistent with the hypoth- esis that high consanguinity is more likely to be associatedwith recessive cardiac abnormalities. Additionally, it ts the perception that the heritability for severe defects is higher than milder malformations. Grant: Yale-National Institutes of Health Center for W. Dong: None. H.

Appelt, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in guiding development and maintaining function of the human heart. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been linked to various con-genital heart diseases including Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), which represents the most common cyanotic heart mal- formation in humans. Several studies have identi ed dys- regulated miRNAs in right ventricular (RV) tissues of TOF patients. In the study presented here, we pro led genome- wide the whole transcriptome and analyzed the relationshipof miRNAs and mRNAs of RV tissues of a homogeneous group of 22 non-syndromic TOF patients. Observed pro les were compared to pro les obtained from right and left ventricular tissue of normal hearts. To reduce the large list of predicted target genes of dysregulated miRNAs, we applied a stringent target prediction pipeline integratingprobabilities for miRNA-mRNA interaction. The nal list of disease-related miRNA-mRNA pairs comprises novel as well as known miRNAs including miR-1 and miR-133,which are essential to cardiac development and function by regulating KCNJ2, FBN2, SLC38A3 and TNNI1. Overall, our study provides additional insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation of malformed TOF hearts. M. Grunert: None. None.

Role of 9p21.3 locus variations in molecular mechanisms ofCAD pathogenesis and the expression of neighbour-genes remain unknown. The study aims to assess of expressions of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, ANRIL and ANRIL splices variantsassociation with to investigate the impact of 9p21.3 locus variations on the expression of studied genes in by QRT-PCR inperipheral blood, EAT, MAT and SAT of 25 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting due to CAD and 25 non-CAD patients undergoing heart valve surgery.ANRIL gene expression levels were signi cantly up- regulated while expression levels of circANRIL were signicantly down-regulated in peripheral blood of CAD patients. Moreover, increased expression levels of circAN- RIL were associated with less severity of CAD. ROC analysis data has also con rmed that circANRIL could act as a potential biomarker for detecting CAD. Conclusions: Our results are the rst data presenting the expressions of ANRIL and its splice variants in cardiacadipose tissues of CAD patients. We demonstrate circAN- RIL has a synergistic effect with ANRIL and plays a protective role in CAD. circANRIL could possibly be usedas a biomarker for CAD in Tanzania. G. Akan: None. E. Nyawawa: None.

P05.29.B Members of subgingival plaque bacterial complexes are present in blood of patients with coronary artery disease264 J. del Pasto, Colombia Introduction: It has been hypothesized that oral bacteria can migrate, through the blood, from the mouth to the arteryplaques exacerbating atherosclerosis. This study compared the bacteria present in peripheral blood of individuals with and without coronary artery disease. Materials and Methods: RNA sequences from blood downloaded from GEO (GSE58150) correspond to 8 cases with coronary artery calcium (CAC) >514 and 8 controls(CAC=0). After quality controls, the sequences were aligned to the hg38 reference genome using Hisat2. unmapped sequences were fed into Kraken to determinatebacterial taxa. Ecological indices were calculated using Vegan. The counts of bacteria between groups was compared using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The mean number of species was different between cases (433.4) and controls (226.1) ( p-value = 0.0001). A total of 129 species were found only in cases and74 were exclusive of controls. According to the Jaccard similarity index 16% of the species identi ed is not shared between cases and controls (p =0.001). The Alcaligenaceae family was more frequent in cases than in controls (FDR: 0.048). The red complex bacteria Treponema denticola was detected only in 2 cases. The mean count of bacteriabelonging to subgingival plaque bacterial complexes was higher in cases (573.5) than in controls (249) ( p-value= 0.0206). Conclusions: This study identi ed periodontopathogens in blood of patients with coronary artery disease. The list of microorganisms presented only in cases will be key toidentify new periodontopathogens that can relate period- ontitis and this cardiovascular disease.

P05.30.C Molecular genetic screening in patients with sponta- neous coronary artery dissection M. Antonutti 1, D. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of myo- cardial infarction, particularly in women often with fewcardiovascular risk factors. SCAD is de ned as a sponta- neous tear in the coronary arterial wall that is not traumatic or iatrogenic. Studies are still underway to investigate therole of genetics in promoting SCAD; genetic diseases fre- quently associated with SCAD are connective tissue dis- eases. Considering the role of SCAD for sudden cardiacdeath and the increased risk for future cardiac events, an early diagnosis is crucial. We enrolled 60 patients with nonatherosclerotic angiographic diagnosis of SCAD. Allpatients 'genomic DNA was analyzed by NGS with gene panel involved in collagenopathies to carry potential SCAD- related mutations. In particular, we observed a pathological COL3A1 mutation; 3 different VUS mutations in: LTBP2 (two patients), MYLK andNOTCH1 . Moreover, we found a new nonsense mutation in SMAD3 and a missense alteration inCOL5A2; both not enlisted in public database, but that could be categorized as pathogenetic and VUS, respec-tively, according to the ACMG classi cation. These data support the use of sequencing of genes inclusive of col- lagenopathies and arteriopathies as an approach to evaluategenetically mediated SCAD. However,, considering that only a minority of patients have clear SCAD-causative mutations, these results remark the need of further studies todene genetic mechanisms of SCAD. M. Antonutti: None. F.

Genetic aetiology of SCD in a representative Czech cohort with post mortem diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was studied and results com- pared to those in living cases. Patients and Methods: Altogether 47 victims of SCD with post mortem genes (Sophia Genetics, Switzerland). Results: The causative detection rate (according to ACMG.net classes 4 or 5) in SCD victims with DCM was 60 % (6/10) and in living patients with DCM 47.4 % (18/ 38). Variants in TTN,RBM20 ,DES andFLNC prevailed. Detection rate in ACM was 5 % (1/19 in SCN5A gene) in SCD victims and 31.8 % (7/22) [JJ1] in living patients. The detection rate in SCD victims with HCM was 16 % (3/18)and in living patients 35 % (19/54). The most prevalent gene was MYBPC3 , while PRKAG2 was detected in SCD victim and in cardiac arrest survivor. Conclusion: Post-mortem genetic analysis in DCM yields a high detection rate and allows effective primary prevention of SCD in at risk relatives. In contrast, molecularautopsy of HCM and ACM renders a much lower yield which could re flect more complex genetic aetiologyin SCD. Supported by Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic, grant Nr.

Using a discovery phase of 2,719 cases and 4,440 controls and a replication phase of 584 independent casesand 966 controls, we identi ed and replicated two new DCM-associated loci one on chromosome 3p (meta-analysis p=5.3 10 13) and the second on chromosome 22q (meta- analysis p =5.0 1010) while con rming the two previously identi ed DCM loci on chromosome 10 and 1, BAG3 HSPB7 for an estimated heritability of 31% \u00b1 8%. The genetic risk score constructed from the number of lead risk- alleles at these 4 loci revealed a 27% risk increased in individuals with 8 risk-alleles compared to the 5 risk allelesreference group. The two association signals were then ne- mapped by combining in silico and functional genomics investigations. While a few genes remain candidates at thesecond locus and deserve further investigations, our work clearly identi ed one gene as responsible for the association at the rst locus whose role in the pathophysiology of DCM is supported by recent observations in human and mice. As the biological pathway in which this gene is involved is a potential target for pharmacological agents, our nding opens novel therapeutic perspectives for treating or pre- venting heart failure. These results provide new ndings that add both on the understanding of the genetic archi-tecture of heart failure and on potential new players involved in the pathophysiology of this devastating disease.

We describe the current practice andresults of genetic evaluation in children with DCM and evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations that may guide prognosis. Methods: We performed a multicentre prospective observational study in children diagnosed with DCM from 2010-2017. Results: One hundred forty-four patients were included. Initial diagnostic categories consisted of idiopathic DCM in 67 children (47%), familial in 18 (13%), neuromuscular in 7(5%), inborn error of metabolism in 4 (3%), malformation syndrome in 2 (1%), myocarditis in 23 (16%) and 'other'in 23 was 2.1 years [IQR 1.0-4.3]. Hundred-seven patients (74%) underwent genetic testing. A likely pathogenic (LP) or pathogenic (P) variant was found in 39 children (36%); the majority in MYH7 (n= 9). Three patients had more than one LP/P variant. In at least 5/39 patients (13%) the variant occurred de novo. During the study, 39 patients (27%) reached a studyendpoint (SE: all-cause death or heart transplantation). Transplant-free survival was signi cantly lower in patients with a LP/P variant ( P=0.005). Children who carried a LP/ P variant were 2.8 times more likely to reach a SE compared to children without, while clinical characteristics atAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 267diagnosis 95%CI 1.3-5.8, P=0.007). Conclusions: Genetic testing is useful to predict clinical outcome in children with DCM and should be incorporated into the initial work-up. Patients with a LP/P variant have a poorer prognosis than patients without LP/P variant. J.C. Herkert: None. M.H. van der de Laar: None. J.M.A. Verhagen: None. D.Q.C.M. R.H. A. G. Fleming , L. Brett, S. Wilkinson, S. John, L. Briggs, M. Edwards, D. J. Morris-Rosendahl Clinical Genomics Laboratory, London, United KingdomDCM is a highly heterogeneous condition with over 30 genes implicated in inherited forms, including TTN.TTN truncating variants are found in ~2% of the general popu- lation (Roberts et al. (2015) Sci Transl Med . 7(270); 270) but there is a higher association with DCM for truncatingvariants in cardiac isoforms of titin; therefore, only cating in exons which are spliced into >90% of TTN cardiac transcripts are reported as potentially patho- genic in DCM by our laboratory. We have identi edTTN truncating variants that have been classi ed as either likely pathogenic or pathogenic in 82 of 613 DCM patients in ourcohort. Due to the prevalence of TTN truncations in healthy individuals, predictive testing for truncating TTN variants is offered with caution, and instead segregation testing inaffected relatives is rst undertaken. Within our cohort we have found several variants which do not segregate with DCM. Out of a total of 36 individuals, across 25 families,we have 5 cases of non-segregation of truncating TTN variants; 3 frameshift, 1 splice one All of these non-segregating variants are absent frompopulations databases and occur in exons which are spliced into 100% of cardiac TTN isoforms; and were therefore initially classi ed as likely pathogenic. These ndings highlight the importance of a cautious approach when interpreting TTN truncating variants, as well as the risks of predictive testing; especially if this results in clinical dis-charge for individuals who do not carry the familial trun- TTN variant.A.G.

Haagmans, J. C. Defesche Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Genetic and acquired dyslipidemias are very frequent in the general population and strongly associated with premature atherosclerosis, myocardial infarctions, arterial complications and sudden death at young age.Genetic lipoprotein abnormalities can be explained by a limited number of genes. For optimal clinical management, risk assessment and prevention of cardiovascular disease anaccurate diagnosis is an absolute requirement, but the interconnection between the metabolic pathways of differ- ent lipoprotein fractions jeopardizes this when only lipidlevels are assessed. Materials and Methods: In order to pinpoint the culprit lipoprotein fraction of clinical dyslipidemia in 4277patients, we evaluated NGS and CNV data, including 29 dyslipidemia-associated genes that enabled to examine all separate lipoprotein components simultaneously. With thisapproach 10 types of dyslipidemia can be discriminated. Moreover, this panel includes a genetic risk factor for statin intolerance. Results: A genetic cause for dyslipidemia was found in 32% of the patients. Of these, 4% carried a CNV. The specic initial clinical diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia were con rmed in only 17 and 35% of patients, respectively. However, unsolicited ndings causal for a second or an unexpected type of dyslipidemia, wereencountered in 17% of cases, and suggest a broader role than initially anticipated for variants causing dysbetalipo- proteinemia or hypertriglyceridemia. Conclusions: The use of the NGS-Dyslipidemia gene panel accurately separated genetic from acquired dyslipi- demias and within the detected genetic dyslipidemias thediagnosis was re ned based on unsolicited ndings in a substantial number of patients. This allows targeted and optimal treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk. L. Zuurbier: None. O.R.F. Mook: None.

Bik-Multanowski Department of Medical Genetics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland Congenital heart defects can decrease the quality of life and life expectancy in affected individuals, and constitute a major burden for the health care systems. Endocardialcushion defects are among the most prevalent heart mal- formations in the general population, and are extremely frequent (approximately a 100-fold higher prevalence) inchildren with Down syndrome. Several genes have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of these mal- formations, but no common pathogenic DNA variants havebeen identi ed so far. Here, we focussed on constitutive, epigenetic alterations of function of selected genes, poten- tially important for endocardial cushion development. Weused two types of microarrays, dedicated for assessment of gene promoter methylation and whole genome expression. First, we compared the gene promoter methylation proles between two groups of Down syndrome patients, with and without heart defects of endocardial cushion-type. Then, to determine the functional role of the detectedmethylation alterations, we assessed the expression of the genes of interest. We detected signi cant hypermethylation of the NRG1 gene promoter region in children with heartdefects. NRG1 is a key factor in maturation of endocardial cushions. Supplementary gene expression assessment revealed signi cantly decreased activity of the ERBB3, SHC3 and SHC4 genes in children with heart defects. The above three genes are closely related to the NRG1 gene and are crucial elements of the NRG/ErbB pathway. The resultsof this pilot study show that hypermethylation of the NRG1 gene promoter can re flect the functional genome alteration contributing to development of congenital heart defects ofendocardial cushion-type.

Berg Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom Background: DNA analysis for FamilialHypercholesterolaemia (FH), including the LDLR ,PCSK9 and ApoE genes, is available to Scottish individuals with high cholesterol who ful l Simon Broome criteria. The aim of mutation identi cation is to allow more effective man- agement of the proband, as well as cascade testing and identi cation of at risk individuals. The ultimate aim is early statin treatment of affected individuals with prevention of cardiovascular morbidity. Method: 60 index patients with causative LDLR muta- tions were identi ed between 2010 and 2018 in NHS Tayside (Scotland). We used record linkage to assess the effect of genetic testing on cholesterol levels on probandsand the number of subsequent cascade tests performed on family members. The main endpoint we used was achieving a 50% reduction of LDL cholesterol levels, as recom-mended by the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE). Results: 49/189 (25.9%) eligible rst degree relatives received cascade testing. Where data was available, 6/22 (27.3%) patients met the 50% reduction target in LDL-C levels. There was no demonstrable relationship betweencholesterol reduction and attendance at a cardiovascular risk clinic. Conclusions: The number of cascade tests following diagnosis in a proband is low. Even if a causative LDLR mutation was identi ed, there was limited impact on the clinical improvement of cholesterol levels, with only aminority of patients achieving recommended cholesterol lowering following diagnosis. A better mechanism for cascade testing and management of FH is required to gainthe maximum clinical bene t from DNA analysis in Familial Hypercholesterolaemia. C. Leung: None. E. Gellatly: None. J.

Bardey1, Institutes of Neurogenetics and Cardiogenetics, L\u00fcbeck,Germany, 3Department Introduction: Autosomal-dominant familial hypercholes- terolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by increased plasma concentrations of LDL-Cholesterol and asubstantially elevated risk for cardiovascular disease. Mutations in three major genes are known to cause FH: theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics Conference: Interactive e-Posters 269LDL gene ( PCSK9 ). Our aim is to analyze the mutation spectrum and to determine a polygenic risk score in a cohort of hypercholesterolemic patients. Methods: We screened 336 patients who were clinically assessed by the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) score and suspected to have FH for disease causing variants and genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tocalculate the polygenic risk score for the FH patients and a control group of 1,946 healthy participants. Results: We identi ed an FH causing variant in 117 of the 336 patients (12 novel variants) from the FH cohort. Most sequence variants were found in the LDLR gene (84.9%) out of which 44.4% were of the missense type. Thediscriminatory power of the DLCN score distinguished FH mutation carriers from non-carriers with an AUC =0.76 ( p < .001) in a receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve,similar to the value for native LDL-C (AUC =0.77 ( p< .001)). Similar to previous studies, the mean polygenic risk score was signi cantly higher in FH mutation negative subjects than in FH mutation positive patients ( p< .05) and healthy controls ( p< .001). Conclusions: This study substantiates the known clinical and genetic variability of FH for German hypercholester- olemic patients and examines a possible polygenic aetiology. L. Rieck: None. F.

P05.43.A FLNC gene in Hypertrophic accurate classi cation E. Cuesta-Llavona , R. Lorca, B. D\u00edaz-Molina, J. Lambert, B. Alonso, S. Iglesias-\u00c1lvarez, J. Reguero, E. Coto, J. Asturias, Oviedo, Spain Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease. Recent studies have identi ed the Filamin C ( FLNC ) gene as a HCM-associated gene. The aim of this study is to assign the percentage of HCM cases which could be relationated with FLNC variants. We sequenced 924 index cases of HCM for a compre- hensive cardiovascular gene panel of 194 genes, in an Ion GeneStudio S5 Sequencer. We identi ed 365 patients (39%) with variants in the sarcomeric and FLNC genes. Among them, 330 (90%) were carriers of sarcomericvariants, and 35 (10%) harbored rare FLNC variants (either not described or 10 cases in gnomAD). Eleven patients were carriers of both sarcomeric and FLNC variant, thus their were excluded to the further analysis and variant classi cation since their pathogenicity is complex to measure. In this way, we nally selected 24 carriers of 20 different FLNC variants. Family studies were performed in 16/24 cases. In total, we identi ed 55 relatives who harbor a FLNC variant, thirty nine of them have a HCM diagnosis (71% penetrance). According to the ACMG criteria, and the performed family studies, seven variants (35%) have been classi ed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, twelve as variants of unknown signi cance (60%), and a variant classi ed as benign or likely benign (5%). In conclusion, at least 1.2% of HCM index cases harbor a FLNC likely pathogenic variant. However, further co-segregation and functional studies have to be performed in order to accomplish an accurate variant classi cation, specially in VUS variants. E. Cuesta-Llavona: None. R.

Of these, deleterious mutations in270 J. del Picchiathe Growth/Differentiation Factor 1 ( GDF1 ) gene have recently been shown to cause heterotaxy with varied com- plex heart malformations of left-right patterning, in 23 individuals reported to date, either in monoallelic or bial- lelic state. We report three unrelated individuals exhibiting heterotaxy with congenital heart defects, each originatingfrom consanguineous kindreds of truncating c.608G>A (p.W203*) mutation in theGDF1 gene, was revealed as the molecular basis of their disease. Subsequently, targeted sequencing of this variant showed full segregation with the disease in these families,with over 15 reportedly affected individuals, enabling genetic counselling, prenatal diagnosis and planning of future pregnancies.

The LoxC285Fprotein was stably secreted butexhibited decreased enzymatic activity and altered crosslinks. Structural analysisby two photon and scanning electron microscopyrevealed holes in the elastic lamellar sheets that increased with age and blood pressure. As in humans, the rate of aortic dilation was higher in males, but was also ampli ed by pregnancy. Lox mutants showed altered transcription of matrisome genes and their aortas showed increased susceptibility to elastase. Taken together, these ndings suggest that missense variation surrounding the LOX copper binding domain increases risk for aortic aneurysm while missense variation in the region encoding the N-terminal pro-domain appearslargely tolerated. Novel gene- rst studies are underway to test this hypothesis in a large hospital-based cohort. Our mouse studies con rm that copper binding domain LOX variants cause disease through the production of a dysfunctional extracellular matrix that is unusually suscep- tible to proteolytic damage. In both humans and mice, theprogressive weakening of the connective tissue leads to worsening aortic disease, modi ed by sex and blood pressure. Funding: NIH HL006244, USA K. Tsang: None. R.H.

Genome-wide association studies have iden- tied more than 100 genetic loci for atrial brillation, including HCN4 loci associated with duration of the PR interval, a proxy for AV dysfunction. Recent candidateAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 271studies suggest an association between HCN4 variants and AV-block. We seek to determine the contribution of rare genetic variants in HCN4 to complete AV-block, 1. degree AV-block and BBB in the general population. Materials/methods: The UK Biobank is a population- based study of 500 000 individuals study, we included persons of genetically determined white-European ancestry and ana-lyzed their exome data. Analyses were performed using a logistic mixed-effects model. A gene-based burden analysis and single variant test were performed to examine therelationship between HCN4 variants and complete AV- block, 1. degree AV-block and BBB in the general population. Results: The study included 43,371 persons. In an analysis of the HCN4 genes a signi cant association between rare variants (MAF < 0.01) in HCN4 gene wasfound (complete AV-block, P =2.5 x 10 5, 1. degree AV- block, P =1.3 x 103and BBB, P =0.01). The association to complete AV block was mostly driven by the variantsSer835Phe (P =2.7e 3), Glu153Gly Conclusions: HCN4 variants contribute to the risk of complete AV-block, 1. degree AV-block and BBB in the general population. These HCN4 variants seem to confer a substantial penetrance. Clinical screening for some of thesevariants seems appropriate. J.S. Jensen: None. O.B. Vad: None. None.

Petrovic1, B. of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,2Depart- of Cardiovascular University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,3Clinical Institute of Genomic Medicine, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: MicroRNAs are highly investigated for their role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Never- theless, evidence for clinical implementation is still lacking.In our systematic review, we evaluated the potential of microRNA as pathophysiological and diagnostic bio- markers of heart failure. Materials and methods: The literature search was conducted in the PubMed database up to August 2019.Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was used to assess the quality of included research papers. Using miRTarBase, we identi ed all known gene targets for selected miRNAs that were differentially expressed in research papers included in the systematic review. We then comprised the list of all target genes and performed gene setenrichment analysis using Enrichr. Results from KEGG, BioPlanet, and We identi ed 72 differentially expressed micro- RNA molecules among groups of heart failure patients and control groups. There was no substantial overlap of differentially expressed in more than one included study. Gene setenrichment analysis, based on the gene targets of micro- RNAs presented in included studies, showed that gene targets of differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched inMAPK signaling pathway, TGF signaling pathway, PI3K- Akt signaling pathway, IL-2 signaling pathway, apoptosis pathway, p53 activity regulation, angiogenesis pathway,and PDGF signaling pathway. Conclusions: Results of our systematic review show that currently, there is insuf cient support for the use of any of the presented miRNAs as a pathophysiological or prog- nostic biomarker in the clinical setting.

Here, we present a large family from a genetically isolated population presenting withCVDs, including congenital heart defects (CHD) and familial thoracic aortic aneurysms (FTAA), caused by a loss-of-function the Notch target gene HEY2 , which hasn 't been associated with hereditary CVDs in humans previously. Methods: The index patient, who has severe CVD, underwent trio WES. The identi ed variant was subse- quently screened in 30 members of this patient 's family, which has a high prevalence of CVDs. Additionally, 3011unrelated cases and 4940 controls from two datasets (one with CHD and one with FTAA) were screened for rare risk variants in HEY2 . To investigate how the various identi ed variants in fluence gene function, the regulatory activity of mutated and wildtype HEY2 on a target gene was measured with qPCR. ed in three individuals with life- threatening CVDs. Twenty family members were found tobe heterozygous for this variant, of whom 80% had CVD. Two additional CVD datasets show enrichment for rare, likely deleterious variants in HEY2 after meta-analysis. Lastly, we demonstrate that these variants induce failure of repression of HEY2 target genes. Conclusions: Wend that rare HEY2 variants predispose to a broad spectrum of CVDs and advise clinicians to consider HEY2 as a causative gene in unsolved CVDpatients. Identifying a potentially deleterious variant in HEY2 warrants clinical follow-up. E.S. van Walree: None. G. Dombrowsky: None. I.E. Jansen: None. M. Umi eviMirkov: None. R. Zwart: None. A.

Wid\u00e9n1 1FIMM, Helsinki, Finland,2Department of Public Health, Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki,Helsinki, Finland While severe hypercholesterolemia is a signi cant risk factor for ischemic heart disease (IHD), Finnish patients remain inadequately identi ed and only a part of their mutation load is known. To elucidate the genetic archi-tecture of severe hypercholesterolemia in Finland, we have screened participants of the GeneRISK-study ( n=7 342) originating from South-eastern Finland for novel mutationsand utilized the FinnGen-cohort ( n=110 654) to assess the mutation prevalence, impact, and nationwide distribution. Five percent ( n=366) of GeneRISK-participants had severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL 5 mmol/l) and exome- sequencing revealed 3 R594Q, LDLR P309Kfs and APOB R3527Q, which has not previously been reported in Finland). We also identi ed a novel, likely pathogenic mutation, LDLR R574L. We assessed the geographical distribution of the mutation and the cardiometabolic status of mutation carriers in the nationwide FinnGen-cohort and compared them with unevenly distributed in the country with a high prevalence among individuals born in the Southeast (the ceded Karjala region) and prevalence of cardiovascular disease among mutationcarriers was elevated (22% had been diagnosed with IHD and 14% with stroke). The data further showed that less than half of mutation carriers (both the novel and previouslyknown mutations) were on statin therapy.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 273Our data show that the genetic spectrum of severe hypercholesterolemia in Finland is more diverse than previously anticipated, and further highlight the urgent need for better recognition and treatment of this disease.

Ripatti: identi es between Kingdom,2University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Elevated levels of uric acid (UA), hyperuricaemia, leads to the formation of urate crystals that cause gout. Hyperur- icaemia has also been linked to cardiovascular and meta- bolic diseases but, unlike gout, causality has not beenascertained. Here we utilised biomarker data from the UK Biobank (UKB, n=~500,000) and outcome data from a Finnish biobank, FinnGen ( n=~135,000) to explore the causal relationship between biomarkers and disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 48 available biomarkers were conducted in UKB and FINEMAP wasapplied to ascertain putative causal variants. We assessed the genetic correlation of these biomarkers with 1,485 dis- ease endpoints in FinnGen using LD a signi cant correlation following FDR cor- rection were assessed for causal associations using Men- delian randomisation (MR). GWAS of UA corrected forallopurinol treatment (a UA-lowering medication) was completed on 389,114 individuals and FINEMAP identi ed 320 putative causal signals. Signi cant genetic correlations were found with multiple diseases ( n=183) including hypertensive (rg =0.70, PFDR=8.3x1021). Results from MR analyses con rmed the known causal association of UA with gout (IVW esti-mate=1.6, P FDR=7.8x1062) as well as with poly- arthropathies (IVW estimate =0.37, P FDR=1.9x1012) but not with other diseases. A signi cant causal association was found with hypertension (IVW estimate =0.20, PFDR=0.0015) but horizontal pleiotropy was also detected (MR-Egger intercept P =0.0069). Our nding suggests that although MR does not support the direct association between UA and cardiovascular disease, we observe pleiotropic effects which could support therapies targetingshared pathways.E.M.

Blanco-Verea 1,2,R .C r Myosin Binding Protein C3 gene (MYBPC3) is one of the main genes in which mutations involved in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) appear. One of these pathogenic variants is the deletionrs397515926 that appears in the gnome AD database in only one individual of Latino origin (Allele Fre- quency=0.000004913). However, we have found 18 unre- lated patients with HCM from Galicia with this variant, which has led us to think about a possible founding effect of this variant in the Galician population. Materials and Methods: Trying to unmask a possible founding effect or a distant family relationship between patients, we made a genotyping with the AppliedBiosystems TMAxiomTMSpain Biobank Array in 6 of these patients and in a cohort of healthy Galician and Spanish population. Principal components analysis and discriminantanalysis of principal components were performed in Plink and adegenet package of R software.274 J. del PicchiaResults: discriminant analysis of principal components taking into account rare variants of the array and comparing our patients with the general Spanish and Galician population clearly differentiate our patients with respect to the rest. Conclusions: Considering the results of the analysis of the genotypes between our cases and the general popula- tion, the practically null bibliographic mention and very scarce presence in databases of this variant, we couldassume a possible common origin for the presence of this variant in the Galician population, highlighting a possible founding effect.

Bielska 1, University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland,2Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Bia ystok, Poland,3Department of Invasive Cardiology, Poland, 4Department of Endocrinology, Diabe- tology and Internal Medicine, University of Bialystok, Bia ystok, Poland Introduction: Currently, IHD is the most common cause of death in patients with diabetes and it develops much earlierbefore clinical diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the detection of sensitive and speci c early biomarkers to predict the risk of the IHD development. We postulatethat non-coding miRNAs may have higher diagnostic value for early detection of IHD than in flammatory mediators We serum samples from 43 T2DM patients (24 with IHD and 19 without IHD).The levels of 798 miRNAs were analysed using NanoString nCounter Technology. Additionally, we predicted the key miRNA regulatory network and miRNAs targets andpathways that may be critical in IHD development using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Theconcentration of MIF and CXCL12 was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of each miRNA. Results: Our and FDR <0.05). Furthermore, all miRNAs showed high diagnostic value (AUC>0.85). Targeted genes were identi ed in canonical pathways involved in the pathology of thecardiovascular system. No statistical differences were observed in the concentration of MIF and CXCL12 between tested groups. Conclusions: Our ndings suggest that circulating miRNAs might have a pivotal role in the development of IHD in T2DM patients and may be used as non-invasivelybiomarkers for early diagnosis. A.

We aimed to stratifyAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 275risk of progression to HF in patients by developing a polygenic risk score (PRS). Methods: Using summary statistics from a recent GWAS for HF secondary to CAD (ischemic HF), we computed risk scores by varying the rho parameter in LDPred and varying thep-value threshold and r2. We selected the PRS that maximized the association with ischemic HF the multiethnic Mount Sinai Bio MeBiobank(N =6276). We validated the association in Penn Medicine BioBank(PMBB; N =6674). We performed association analysis using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, smoking history, hypertension, BMI, type 2 diabetes, and ten geneticprincipal components. Results: In Bio Me, one standard deviation (SD) increase in PRS iHFwas signi iHFin a subset of individuals with CAD but no evidence of obstructive p =0.02; 2692 cases, 2472 controls) but not African Africans (adjusted OR =0.94; p =0.3; 921 cases, 589 controls). Conclusions: We derived and validated a PRS for ischemic HF in two multiethnic cohorts and demonstrated association with and without obstructive CAD. PRS iHF replicated in patients of European ancestry, but not in African ancestry. Although studies on clinical utility and in more diverse populations are needed, our results suggest application in early risk strati cation. I. Paranjpe: None. J. De Freitas: None. N. Tsao: None. R.

P05.58.A Identifying Long QT syndrome (LQTS) patients in primary care, an approach for rare diseases . W. R. H. Evans1, S. F. Weng1, R. K. Akyea1, A. D. Simms2, J. Kai1, N. Qureshi1 1University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United 2Department of Cardiology, Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom Introduction: LQTS is a rare (~1 in 2000 births) inherited cardiac arrhythmia that predisposes patients to syncope andsudden cardiac death. Identi cation and treatment can substantially reduce this risk. We aimed to identify the clinical features that precede the diagnosis of LQTS inprimary care and use these to develop a predictive model.Methods: 1495 patients diagnosed with LQTS and 7475 propensity-score matched controls were identi ed in a database of primary care electronic records (CPRD). A range of clinical features that occurred at greater frequency in cases than control (p <0.05) before diagnosis were identi ed and incorporated into a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: 18 clinical features were incorporated into the nal model, including: epilepsy (1.70 (1.12, 2.56)), palpitations (2.22 (1.80, 2.74)), collapse (1.636 (1.32, 2.03), mitral valve disease (2.64 (1.41, 4.91)), atrial brillation (1.91 (1.41, 2.60)) and IBS (1.78 (1.41, 2.26)) (OR (95% CI)). The discriminative accuracy of the model assessed by area under the curve (AUC) was 0.74, (95% CI 0.73 to 0.75), with in two moretightly phenotyped subgroups: LQTS diagnosis <45 years and Conclusion: This study demonstrates that it is possible to develop a predictive model for LQTS that performs with similar accuracy to other widely adopted cardiovascular riskmodels. Furthermore, it shows the potential of primary care records to phenotypically identify patients that are at an increased risk of having a rare disease. W.R.H. Evans: D.

P05.60.C Functional investigation of possible pathogenic EPHB4 associated with lymphatic related fetal Sackey, K. Ogmen, D. Grigoriadis, S. Mansour, P. Ostergaard St. George 's University, London, United Kingdom The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has increased the capacity of rare and novel variant detec-tion. However, this brings challenges to con rm patho- genicity of the identi ed variants and evaluate them functionally, both needed for precise clinical diagnostics.This study investigates nine novel possible pathogenic nonsynonymous variants in the EPHB4 (Ephrin Receptor B4) gene. EPHB4 have been associated related fetal hydrops (LRFH) and hereditary haemorrhagic fetal hydrops is char- acterised by fluid accumulation in at least two extravascular fetal compartments and about 15% of the cases result from a lymphatic abnormality. HHT presents commonly with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the liver and lung, in connection with cutaneous and mucosal telangiectasias.Functional analysis including immunoprecipitation, western blotting, and immuno fluorescence assays were performed on nine novel variants on EPBH4 to investigate their pathogenicity. This study demonstrates the pathogenic effect of eight variants out of nine. Most of the LRFH- associated EPHB4 variants presented similar protein expression levels compared to the wildtype protein but reduced tyrosine kinase activity while HHT-associated EPHB4 variants showed a reduction or total absence of protein expression. Based on these results, we suggest there could be two distinct EPHB4-associated disease phenotypes distinguished by two distinctive molecular mechanisms, butfurther research is necessary to elucidate this.

Despite an increasing evidence that supports miRNAs as potential biomarkers in cardiovascular disorders, the underlying mechanismsremain to be elucidated. We aimed to identify metabolites that mediate the effect of miRNAs on cardiovascular disorders. Methods: We performed two steps of two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) to study the causal association between miRNAs and metabolites, and betweenthe metabolites and cardiovascular disorders. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on miRNAexpression data (N =1,687) in the Rotterdam Study to identify genetic instruments for miRNAs. MR was performed in a hypothesis-free manner between 591 miRNAs and 886 metabolites measured by the Metabolon platform. The association of the genetic instruments with metabolites were examined in the Airwave Study(N=1,942). We further performed MR to investigate the causal role of identi ed metabolites on cardiovascular disorders using publicly available GWAS summary results. Results: Our analysis indicated causal associations between 16 miRNAs and 21 metabolites after multiple testing correction. Among the identi ed metabolites, nominally signi cant associations were found between androsterone sulfate, cysteine sul nic acid, and N- palmitoylglycine with stroke, and 3-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid with coronary artery disease. Taken together, we were able to identify metabolites that might link miR-1273h-5p, miR-3937, and miR-4753-5p withstroke, and miR-181a-2-3p with coronary artery disease. Conclusions: Our study has added insight into under- standing the role of metabolites in the link betweenmiRNAs and cardiovascular disorders. This approach could offer a way for nding candidate biomarkers and therapeu- tic targets in cardiovascular disorders. R. Mustafa: None. M. Mens: None. R. Pinto: None. I. Karaman: None. G.

Zhou State Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory for Molecular Diagnostics of Cardiovas- cular Diseases, Diagnostic Laboratory Service, Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China Background: The mosaic carriers have been clinically normal or had only minor manifestations when the pro- portion of mutated cells is low, which makes it dif cult to be detected. However, if the mutations were transmittedfrom asymptomatic carriers to their children, it will cause unexpected occurrence of diseases. So genetic tests are often required. Methods: We choosed 563 patients with suspected marfan syndrome (MFS) or thoracic aortic aneurysm/ dissection, who had been detected by Panel. Among them,we selected 56 patients who carried likely pathogenic (pathogenic) mutations and were not de novo, their parentsAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 277who harbored the same mutation were clinically normal. For these Trio families, we used the Life PGMTMDX platform to perform deep sequencing of single amplicon (approximately 5000\u00d7) on DNA samples extracted from whole blood. Results: We detected two mosaic mutations in these Trio families. The rst patient AD700-1 who had typical MFS features carried the mutation FBN1 , C1305F. After deep sequencing,23% mutated alleles were detected in healthyfather who harbored the same mutation. The second mutation FBN1 , c.2167 +1G>A was identi ed in patient AD1833, who was suspected to be MFS. The mutation wasalso carried by healthy father, who was found to carry 17% of the mutant allele through deep sequencing. Conclusions: Mosaic mutations could be a more common phenomenon in aortic diseases than has been realized so far. Therefore, whenever children are identi ed with harmful mutations, the parents who lack obvious phenotypiccharacteristics should be detected by genetic testing, which will provide more accurate guidance for genetic counseling.

We report a family with two siblings who presented with type A aortic dissections. The sister made an aorticdissection at 45 years-old. The brother made an aortic dis- section at 22 years-old treated with an aortic graft proce- dure, at 46 years-old he had revision surgery because ofpseudoaneurysms complications. His daughter was diag- nosed with a patent ductus arteriosus . Their father suddenly died at 28 years-old. Molecular analysis of a panel of 15aortic aneurysm genes in the brother revealed only the variant c.4599 +3A>C at the 5 'donor exon 33 of MYH11 (NM_00104114.1) with a potential splicing impact. This variant was also present in the affected sister. It was absent from GnomAD and internal variant database (>1000 patients) and never reported in the litera- ture. Interestingly, a single-nucleotide polymorphism is described at this position: c.4599 +3A>G (rs143288748). Interpretation of variations at the position +3 of the 5 'ss is difcult because data of the literature are con flicting with variations reported to induce aberrant splicing in some casesbut not in others. We performed transcript analysis with RNA extracted from an aortic biopsy during the brother 's second intervention. RT PCR revealed a skipping of theexon 33 of MYH11 predicting a truncated myosin tail and a dominant negative effect. This report con rms genotype- phenotype correlations for MYH11 and FAA/PDA. B.

Kilpel\u00e4inen1 1Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences,University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2Department of Public Health, Section of Epidemiology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark Introduction: Humans spend most of the day in a post- absorptive state, and thus prolonged and high postprandiallipemia can have major implications for the risk of cardio- vascular disease. Abdominal adiposity may in fluence post- prandial lipemia by in fluencing lipid metabolism after a meal. To date, >400 genetic loci have been discovered for association with abdominal adiposity, assessed by waist-hipAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 279ratio adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI). Whether these variants are associated with postprandial lipid con- centrations, remains unknown. We thus examined whether genetic risk score for increased waist-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI) is associated with lipid concentrations at fasting state and after a high-fat meal. Materials and Methods: 771 individuals of European ancestry and with obesity from the NUGENOB study consumed a liquid high-fat meal (95% fat of the energycontent). The postprandial concentrations of HDL choles- terol, LDL cholesterol, free fatty acids, glycerol and triglycerides were measured at fasting state and postpran-dially for 3 hours. The associations between the WHRadjBMI score and lipid concentrations were examined using linear models. Results: At fasting state, the genetic risk score for WHRadjBMI was associated with higher fasting triglycer- ides (P =0.0013) and lower HDL cholesterol (P =0.0059). Postprandially, the genetic risk score was not associated with changes in triglycerides or HDL cholesterol (P>0.05), but was signi cantly associated with elevated glycerol =0.012). Conclusions: Genetic predisposition to abdominal adip- osity is associated blood meal. of Diseases, Department of Medicine, Department of Haema-tology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 8Department of Medicine, University ofCambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Addenbrooke 's and Royal Papworth Hospitals, Cambridge, United King- dom Introduction: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and devastating disease, resulting from progressiveobliteration of small caliber pulmonary arteries leading to cardiac failure. PAH can occur in the context of family history or genetic mutations causing heritable PAH, or isconsidered as idiopathic in the absence of an identi ed predisposing factor. Beyond the major gene BMPR2, a gene encoding a type 2 receptor of the BMP signaling pathwayseveral new genes predisposing to PAH have been identi- ed during the last decade. Recently, preliminary evidence of the involvement of the KDR gene was found in a largegenetic association study. Methods: We prospectively analysed the KDR gene by targeted panel NGS sequencing in a series of 311 PAHpatients referred to a clinical molecular laboratory for genetic diagnosis of PAH. Results: Two index cases with severe PAH were found to carry a loss-of-function mutation in the KDR gene. These two patients were clinically characterized by low diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide adjusted for hemoglobin(DLCOc) and radiological evidence of parenchymal lung disease. Segregation analysis in one family revealed that all KDR mutations carriers have a low DLCOc that is morepronounced in affected subjects compared to non-affected Conclusions: Our study provided genetic evidence for considering KDR as a newly identi ed PAH causing gene since we describe the segregation of KDR mutations with PAH in two families. Furthermore, KDR mutations are associated with a particular form of PAH characterized bylow DLCOc and parenchymal lung disease. M. Eyries: None. D. Montani: None. B. Girerd: None. N. Favrolt: None.

Later on, it was associated with other vascular disorders, but still the mechanism of its effect is unknown. Rs9349379 is an eQTL for PHACTR1 in coronary arteries, where A allele leads to higher expression. Also PHACTR1 mRNA expression is elevated in the heart after MI, indicating its up-regulation in pathological conditions. The aim of our study was to investigate the association of rs9349379 with therst MI in Serbian population and its effect on PHACTR1 mRNA expression in PBMC of MI patients and controls. Methods: Blood samples from 171 controls and 156 patients with the rst MI were obtained for DNA extraction. For RNA extraction, we collected 32 control samples and65 samples of patients six months after the rst MI. Genotyping and expression analysis were performed with Taqman technology. Statistical analyses were done byStatistica 8 software. Results: The association of rs9349379 with the rst MI was not signi cant (p=0.13). PHACTR1 mRNA expression was signi cantly higher in MI patients compared to controls (p=0.02). We have found that rs9349379 has no effect on PHACTR1 mRNA expression in control group (p =0.90), while AA genotype led to higher expression in patient group (p =0.04). Conclusions: Rs9349379 affects PHACTR1 mRNA expression in PBMC of MI patients, six months after the MI. In order to accurately estimate its association with MI, further analysis and larger sample size are needed. Fundedby Serbian Ministry, grant III41028. J. Kuveljic: None. T. Djuric: None. M.

P05.71.B Polygenic risk scores for hypertension risk strati \"Carlo Besta \", Milan, Italy,3Genomics of Renal Diseases and Hypertension Unit, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Raffaele University, Milan, Italy,4Dept. Of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy,5Hypertension and related diseases Centre Department of Clinical and Experimental MedicineUniversity of Sassari Italy, Sassari, ItalyIntroduction: Hypertension (HTN) is a major cardiovas- cular risk factor and responsible for ~50% of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Blood pressure (BP) is also a complex genetic trait with heritability estimates of 30-50%. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identi ed a high number of genetic loci associated with HTN and BPtraits, indicating underlying polygenic architectures. This study proposes to compute polygenic risk scores (PRS) for HTN and BP for potential genetic risk strati cation. Materials and Methods: We investigated the additive effect of common genetic variants on HTN and BP by means of regression models based on PRS. We usedgenotyping data of 561 cases and 731 controls from Hypergenes cohort. We computed PRS based on clumping and thresholding method using GWAS summary statisticsof systolic/diastolic BP measurements from GERA cohort (99,785 health records) and the HTN case-control cohort of the UK Biobank (144,793 controls). Results: PRS for HTN and diastolic/systolic BP are strongly associated with hypertensive status and BP measurements. The highest signi cance is achieved for the case-control status by considering UK Biobank effect sizes (p =6.4e-28, R2 =0.09). The area under the curve is 0.68. The model remains signi cant after adjusting for sex and body mass index (p =4.1e-27). Conclusions: PRS modeling shows a strong polygenic component both for HTN status and for BP levels. Despitethe limited predictive accuracy expected for BP, which is largely in fluenced by environmental factors, the strength of associations suggests that PRS could be potentially used forgenetic risk strati cation.

Knowledge of the underlying genetic cause can aid prognostication and clinical man-agement and enables accurate recurrence risk counselling. Here our aim was to identify the causative genetic variant(s) in families with children affected by severe DCM. Materials and Methods: Exome/genome sequencing was performed on leukocyte DNA from seven children affected with severe DCM and their unaffected parents fromve independent families, followed by inheritance-based gene-agnostic variant ltering. Families were brought together by an collaborative effort facilitatedby GeneMatcher. Results: DCM presented early (range: 3 months -9 years) and was progressive, resulting in death ( n=3) or transplant ( n=3), with one child currently awaiting transplant. Biallelic variants in PPP1R13L were identi ed in the affected children in each family. PPP1R13L encodes inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 protein (iASPP). iASPP has roles in apoptosis, acts as a regulator of desmosomes and has been implicated in in flammatory pathways. Spontaneous biallelic loss-of-function variants in PPP1R13L orthologues have shown to bovine and murine models of DCM and biallelic variantswere previously reported for the of novel and emerging candidate genes. The identi cation of these ve families now provides suf cient evidence to support a robust gene- disease association between PPP1R13L and severe paedia- tric DCM. PPP1R13L is therefore recommended testing for paediatric DCM. H.K. Robinson: None. E. None. part-time); Sig- nicant; GeneDx None. V. Kaimonov: None. N. Shirokova: None. E. C. S. Ellard: None.

Molecular de Duve Institute, of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejoen, Korea, Republic of,5Walloon Excellence in Lifesciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO), UCLouvain,Brussels, Belgium Purpose: Primary lymphedema (PLE) is caused by devel- opmental and functional defects of the lymphatic system resulting in accumulation of protein-rich fluid in tissues. The 28 currently known genes causing lymphedema explain<30% of cases. We search for additional genes to better understand pathophysiology. Methods: We used WES to screen 543 patients within our cohort of >900 index patients. We ltered variants using our in-house developed Highlander software. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to validate functionaleffects. Results: We identi ed a complete angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) gene deletion in one family, and four variants of interest in four other families. All are extremely rare or absent in controls and databases, and predicted to be pathogenic by several algorithms. Functional analyses ofthe substitution-mutants unraveled that 3/4 showed decreased ANGPT2 secretion and even inhibited secretion of the wild-type ANGPT2, suggesting that they have adominant-negative effect. The fourth mutant, located in the dimerization interphase, showed reduced integrin- 5 bind- ing and its expression in mouse skin promoted hyperplasiaand dilation of cutaneous lymphatic the ligand ANGPT2 as a novel cause of primary lymphedema.The mutations alter ANGPT2 structure and/or function. The data underscore loss of ANGPT2 function as the282 J. del Picchiamechanism leading to primary lymphedema, and provide new insights into TIE2 signaling. The ANGPT2 gene is now included in the diagnostic panel used in our hospital to perform diagnostic testing for primary lymphedema.

Mutation in several known risk genes predispose to disease however, some cases remain geneti- cally unde ned. Increasing knowledge of the underlaying molecular mechanisms may lead to a better understanding of the disease and the opening of new drug targets that can improve the treatment of patients. The advance in massiveparalleled sequencing technologies has allowed improving the characterization of the molecular pro ling of the patients and a better clinical characterization. Material and methods: The aim of this project is to study 20 patients and available relatives by whole exome sequencing (WES) technology in order to identify newgenes and regions that can be involved in PAH. Variant prioritization was performed through bioinformatic tools and a custom algorithm. In addition, to stablish mechanisticsignicance, a series of in vitro studies were performed. Results: Several candidate genes were identi ed after the variant prioritization. We have identi ed two genes ( TRAF2 andTNIP2 ) in two unrelated families, which are related to the NF pathway, associated with the progression of PAH.In vitro studies demonstrate a possible impairment of NF transcription factors localization of a modulation of NF-inducible genes after inhibition of ABIN2 and TRAF2. Conclusions: Although these results have to be validated through more different functional assays, they suggested anassociation between disease and new genes which may also be considered for inclusion in genetic screening for PAH patients.

P05.77.B Association of two novel SCN5A intragenic duplications with epilepsy, ventricular tachycardia, brillation and Brugada-like Collecchio, Italy In the last years, the increasing evidences about the co- existence of genetically based cardiac arrhythmias andepilepsy brings out the emerging concept of cardio-cerebral channelopathy. In this view, we describe two unrelated cases presenting cardiac and epileptic phenotypes in whichtwo novel intragenic duplications in encodes for the -subunit of the Na v1.5 channel and mutations in this gene are mainly involved in electrical channelopathies that lead to life-threatening arrhythmias (Brugada syndrome, Long-QT syndrome, Sudden Infant Death syndrome, etc.) or struc- tural changes in the myocardium, such as in the dilatedcardiomyopathy (DCM). With the aim of characterizing the biological effects of such genetic defects, we studied the biophysical properties of the Na v1.5 channels revealing that duplication might prompt for a loss-of-function of the Nav1.5-mediated current in a zebra sh model without alterations in the heart structure and function (at least for therst mutation). Taking together, clinical and biochemical data support the idea that the intragenic in-frameAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 283duplications within the SCN5A gene could be responsible for both cardiac and epileptic phenotypes.

While the majority of mutations have no functional signi cance, some can contribute to disease and aging. The nature of the arterial wall, with itsmedia being composed of clonal smooth muscle cells, makes this tissue particularly sensitive to somatic muta- genesis. Here we analyzed progerin, the protein responsiblefor the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford pro- geria syndrome (HGPS), for its possible involvement in the accelerated vascular aging process observed in chronickidney disease (CKD), due to similarities in vascular phe- notypes. We provide evidence for expression of progerin, and the occurrence of the HGPS-causing LMNA c.1824C>T mutation as a somatic mutation in CKD patient arteries. Clonal populations of vascular cells with the 1824C>T mutation was supported by clusters of progerin positivecells in the media and a high frequency of the mutant allele in several CKD arteries. Further analysis of proliferation and DNA damage in the CKD arteries indicated regenera-tion and progerin-induced genomic damage. Our results implicate somatic mutations in the functional decline of the vascular wall and support that somatic mutations maybecome a risk factor during extensive tissue damage. G. Revechon: None. H.

It is the prime cause of acute myocardial infarction in women below theage of 50. Fibromuscular with condensed areas of arterial stenosis, aneurysm, tortuosity and dissection. It has become clear that FMD is prevalent inSCAD cohorts and vice versa. However, the genetic etiol- ogy of both conditions remains largely elusive. We aimed to investigate the contribution of rare genetic variants in vas-cular Ehlers-Danlos and the Marfan, Loeys-Dietz (LDS), genes to the etiology of SCAD and FMD in a large with or without FMD and 111 isolatedFMD patients. Subsequent variant ltering was performed. The gnomAD database was used as an independent control dataset and ltered identically.

A combined LDS-gene burden analysis was performed, revealing a highly signi cant association (4.5% vs 1.5%; p =0.000003). When performed for FMD, none of284 J. del Picchiathe analyses yielded a signi cant p-value or showed a trend. We here provide evidence for an important contribution of rare genetic variants in LDS genes to the etiology of SCAD.

Our aim is to identify genetic factors that in fluence steroid hormone metabolism, to detect genetic sexual dimorphisms and toinvestigate possible causal implications for atherosclerotic vascular disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: In two independent cohorts, we performed genome-wide sex-speci c meta-association stu- dies of loci (p < 5x10 8) were tested for sex differences in effect size. The causal relationships between hormone levels and atherosclerotic vascular diseases were investigated using sex-speci c eQTL analyses and Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches. Results: We detected 22 genome-wide signi cant loci for seven steroid hormones of our panel, of which ninedisplayed signi cant sexual dimorphisms. Eight loci relate to genes coding for enzymes involved in steroid biosynth- esis, almost completing the list of genes of this pathwaywith genetic associations. Other loci correspond, e.g., to the WNT4/ -catenin pathway. MR revealed that cortisol,androstenedione, 17-OHP and DHEA-S had sex-speci c causal effects on coronary artery disease. Conclusions: Our study greatly improves insight into genetic regulation of steroid hormones and their dependence on sex. The signi cant MR estimates support the hypothesis that steroid hormones in fluence the development of atherosclerosis, which partly explains the higher risk for men. These results could serve as a basis for analyzing sex- dimorphisms in other complex diseases.

Massey , J. Dean, L. Deboys, D. O 'Sullivan Aberdeen royal in rmary, Aberdeen, United Kingdom Aim: To quantify our ability to make a genetic diagnosis in drug users with sudden cardiac death (SCD). Background: While there are European recommenda- tions for genetic testing in SCD1, these guidelines do not extend to drug users with positive toxicology at post-mortem. We wanted to gain a better understanding of the genetic pick up rate in this population. Method: We undertook a 10-year retrospective study looking at genetic diagnoses in drug related deaths discussed at the joint pathology-genetic MDT. This was compared to age and provisional aetiology matchedcontrols. Results: 60 drug related deaths were identi ed, and 40 patients underwent genetic testing. 7 variants were found ofwhich 3 were classi ed as benign and 4 VUS. The most common reason for genetic testing was enlarged heart at post mortem; however the genetic pick up in this group was0. Patients with structurally normal hearts had the most variants detected. This would coincide with the majority of variants being found in arrhythmogenic genes. Familyhistory did not in fluence genetic pick up. In the control group variants in arrhythmogenic genes again predominated correlating with the highest genetic pick up in patients withnormal post-mortems. However in the control group 17 variants were detected of which 3 were pathogenic. Conclusions: Our ability to make a genetic diagnosis in drug users with SCD is low. We need to undertake a largerAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 285study to characterise those drug users with a positive genetic diagnosis so testing can be rationalised.

Targeted next generation sequencing A. R. Akilzhanova1, C. Guelly2, Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan,2Center for Medical Research, gery Center, Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan Introduction: Recent advances in genetic screening and the potential of therapeutic intervention in patents with cardiac arrhythmias have garnered this group of disorders muchattention in the scienti c community. The purpose of the study was to identify the genetic basis of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in Kazakhstani patients. Material and Methods: using predeveloped a targeted panel of 96 known cardiac disease genes, associated with cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia we screened 92 indivi-duals, diagnosed with VT and dilated cardiomyopathy (VT DCM) variants identi ed 307 unique variants in 74 genes totaling up in 456 variants for the overall study group. Variants included one in/del, four splice-site and 451 single-nucleotidevariants (SNV) the coding (0.15%) of the SNVs were unique stop-gain variants, three of those residing in the TTN gene. 168 HGMD mutations(61 unique) were observed in 37 genes. According to ACMG all variants were classi ed as 9 variants withuncertain signi cance and rest as benign. Conclusions: Individuals with VT either secondary to DCM or of idiopathic etiology carry multiple rare mutationsand potentially pathogenic sequence variants in cardiac risk genes in a similar pattern and at a comparable frequency.

Rare genetic variants have beenidenti ed as important contributors to the risk of congenital heart disease, but relatively small numbers of TOF cases have been studied. We used whole exome sequencing toassess the prevalence of unique, deleterious variants in the largest cohort of nonsyndromic TOF patients reported to date. The presence of such variants was de ned by their absence in the Genome Aggregation Database and bioin- formatic prediction of their deleterious effect on function. The enrichment of variants in two genes, NOTCH1 5\u00d710-8) after correction for multiple comparisons. NOTCH1 was most frequently found to harbour unique, deleterious variants (4.5%; 95% CI, 3.2%-6.1%). Three NOTCH1 variants were subjected to functional evaluation, and two showed a reduction in Jagged1-induced NOTCHsignalling. FLT4 variants were found in 2.4% (95% CI, of our cohort. In addition, variants in the well- established TOF gene, TBX1 , and the genes were also sig- nicantly enriched. Our study underlines the importance of sequencing large cohorts of CHD cases in order to further discover their genetic basis. Grant reference: BHF (RG/15/12/31616) None.

Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), an early-onset TAAD syn-drome is caused by mutations in genes coding for components of the TGFbeta signaling, including SMAD3 . Remarkably, a fraction of SMAD3 mutation carriers remains cardiovascularly unaffected throughout life, suggesting the existence of genetic modiers for aortopathy. This study implements a combina- tion of linkage analysis and whole-genome sequencing(WGS) in order to identify genetic modi ers that explain the variability in SMAD3 -related aortopathy. Material and Methods: In two 41 mutation linkage analysis was performed. LODscores obtained using MERLIN and SUPERLINK and linkage was complemented with WGS of six affected and six unaffected mutation carriers. Results: In the rst family linkage analysis identi ed a chromosomal region (chr2:149,604,077-155,607,398) with a LOD score of 2.68, suggesting the presence of anaggravating modi er. Linkage peak was observed in the second family with a LOD score of 2.86 (chr18:43,013,157- 57,021,550). Additionally, the WGS data analysis of thesecond family resulted in the discovery of a rare variant in TGFB2 , a known TAA causative gene, exclusively present in affected mutation carriers. Conclusions: The obtained data indicate that variants in known TAAD genes may play a role in modulating a primary causative mutation; chromosomal regions segregatewith disease severity suggesting a presence of genetic modiers and that distinct families may bear different genetic modi ers as indicated by the linkage analysis.

Leng, X. Liu Genetics and Birth Defects Control Center, Beijing Children 's Hospital, Beijing, ChinaIntroduction: Thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD) is a life-threatening disease, of which genetic abnormalities are considered as important risk factors. The present research aims at identifying causal variants in Chi- nese patients with sporadic non-syndromic (ATAAD). Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 73 sporadic Chinese patients with ATAAD, 30 TAAD associated genes were curated forbioinformatic analyses. Clinical differences were compared between patients with and without causal variants. Results: 15 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identi ed (8 novel and 7 previously described) in 4 known TAAD-causal genes ( FBN1 ,TGFBR2 ,SMAD3 FBN1 (7 missense, 3 truncating, SMAD3 frameshift variant. Signi cant clinical differences were found between patients with and without causal variants. Patients with TAAD-causal variants proved to have an earlier onset age, a more dilated aorta, andrelatively intractable subtypes. Even without risk factor like hypertension, they might still suffer from TAAD with TAAD-causal variants. Conclusions: The variants identi ed in our research might not only result in the occurrence of ATAAD, but also add complexities and dif culties to the clinical practice. Our data demonstrated that WES was an effective tool for determining genetic etiologies of non-syndromic ATAAD and could be helpful in genetic counseling for ATAADpatients and their at-risk family members.

P05.87.C Investigating the role of pathogenic TTN variants in heart failure by whole-exome sequencing O. for Genomic Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, United States Heart failure (HF) affects ~40 million people globally. Estimates of the genetic predisposition of developing HF is 1.69 if one parent is affected and 1.92 if both parents haveHF (Framingham cohort study, Lopez et al. 2013). Recent studies suggest higher cardiovascular genetic risk in patients with and without diagnosed heart failure if theyAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 287carry a pathogenic loss of function variant in the gene encoding titin (TTN). Here, we assess the role of pathogenic TTN variants by whole-exome sequencing in 5916 patients with heart failure from two clinical studies CHARM and CORONA, and 268,451 unrelated Europeans from the UK Biobankprospective cohort study, including 4634 individuals with ICD-10 codes for heart failure (HF, based on hospital in- patient diagnoses). In both types of cohorts, we detect a signi cant enrichment of pathogenic TTN variants in subjects with HF diagnosis. Furthermore, after restricting the analysis tothe variants located in exons that are predominantly spliced in the heart, the genetic risk was increased: from 2.54 (95% CI, 1.96-3.31) to 4.52 (95% CI, 3.10-6.68) in the clinicalstudies, and from 2.95 (95% CI, 2.42-3.57) to 4.97 (95% CI, 3.94-6.19) in the UKBB. The enrichment observed is similar in clinical trial data and routine care health records. As expected, individuals with a diagnosis of cardiomyo- pathy had the highest rate of TTN mutations, but we also observed TTN variants in up to 5% of HF patients due toother aetiologies, such as ischaemic and hypertensive disease. This result highlights the importance of TTN variants beyond cardiomyopathies. O. Chazara: cant; Astrazeneca.

Clinical course went fromasymmetric hypertrophy with restrictive phenotype tocardiac dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Pulmonary pressures were strikingly elevated. Case: A 33 years old woman was admitted in 1997 with limiting dyspnoea. Echocardigram showed non-obstructive asymmetrical septal hypertrophy septum restrictive physiology. Sarcoid cardiomyopathywas ruled out with negative scintigraphy and unspeci c biopsy in the absence of other extracardiac features. Atrio- ventricular ablation and permanent pacing were required in2002. Clinical deterioration led to frequent heart failure admissions and one episode of syncope. Implantable cardioverter de brillator was implanted. Emergency trans- plant was performed with a postoperative complicated course in 2006. Patient remained stable to date. Study of the explanted heart demonstrated macro and microscopichypertrophy, extensive brosis, unspeci c vacuolization and disarray. There were no signs of amyloid with usual stains and immunohistochemical typing. Sequencing of theTTR gene led to identi cation of a de novo frameshift mutation p.S132fs*25(g.6903_6906delinsGTAGGG) caus- ing original stop codon lost, results in prolonged protein.Cardiac evaluation of her brother, sister and parents ruled out any sign of cardiomyopathy. All relatives were free for the TTR variant. Conclusions: Case of cardiomyopathy associated with a TTR variant. Severe right and left heart failure clinical course with very particularly severe pulmonary hyperten-sion ended up in heart transplant. Mechanisms of disease in this case remain unknown. J.

Sporadic cases with the onset of the rst symptoms of disease below or equal 40 years of age were considered. Methods: A cohort of 66 PVV patients was collected and exome sequencing of the 35 candidates\u00b4 genes was performed, which focused on the genes encoding structural elements of the vessel wall, metalloproteinases, and theirprotein inhibitors, proteins involved in the homeostasis of the coagulation system and regulation of sex hormones system, as well as genes previously associated with VVdevelopment. Results: Most of the patients (91.9%) had a positive family history of VV, considering rst-, second- or third- degree relatives. 26 potentially pathogenic changes: 12 mutations in 9 genes (7 known and 5 novel), 5 rare SNPs and 9 common SNPs were found. 40% of the patients had apotentially causative mutation in the candidate genes: 33% of them had 1 mutation, 3% had 2 mutations and 1.5% had 3 mutations. The association between one SNP in theMMP-9 gene and the age of the onset of PVV symptoms was also observed. Conclusions: This report provides evidence for the heterogeneity and complexity of the genetic background of PVV in sporadic cases and shows the in fluence of genetic factors on the age of the onset of this disease. It also revealsattractive targets for further research in a larger group of patients and functional analyses. E. Strauss: None. M. Zmyslowski: None. B. Budny: None. L. Dzieciuchowicz: None. E.

Morales Brazil L-amino decarboxylase (AADC) de ciency is caused by bi-allelic variants in the DDC gene. This very rare neurometabolic disorder is clinically characterized by vegetative symptoms, oculogyric crises, dystonia, andsevere neurologic dysfunction, usually beginning in infancy or childhood. Treatment has become available recently. Wequanti ed 3-OMD (3-O-Methyldopa), a suggested AADC- specic biomarker, in blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. Upon suggestive ndings, we subsequently analyzed the DDC gene by amplicon-based next generation sequencing (NGS) and copy number variant (CNV) screening. This two-step approach identi ed several patients. The ones with at least one hitherto undescribed variant are described here in detail. All three patients had pathological levels of 3-OMD. In patient 1, we identi ed a novel whole DDC gene duplication in homozygosity. In patient 2, we identi ed the two missense variants p. (Ser147Ile) and p.(Val60Ala) in compound heterozygosity;interestingly, variant p.(Ser147Ile) was not only novel, but shown to have occurred de novo. In patient 3, p. (Trp121Arg) and p.(Arg347Gln) were identi ed in com- pound heterozygosity. The former is novel, while the latter has frequently been described in AADC patients previously. Using a combined biochemical, NGS and CNV approach, apositive identi cation and diagnosis of AADC de ciency patients is reliably reached. This allows for an early treat- ment of the patients, leading to an improvement of theirquality of life. Moreover, the identi cation of novel DDC variants and the establishment of correlations with 3-OMD levels can be expected to increase our understanding of thedisease. C. Pereira: None. C. Cozma: A.

P06.06.B Clinical study of the relationship between histamie intolerance and variants in the AOC1/ABP1 Gene J. a amine with many essential physiological activities. However, its deregulationand accumulation can cause a multitude of pathologies such as histamine intolerance. There are two enzymes involved in the metabolism of histamine: histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) is responsible for degrading histamine inside cells. Diamine-oxidase (DAO) is the other enzyme involved in the degradation of histamine, mainly exogenous histamine,ingested with the diet. The de ciency of DAO activity could be one of the main causes of histamine intolerance, an alteration in homeostasis that is caused by a reduced intestinaldegradation of histamine, with the consequent increase in its plasma levels. Variants in AOC1/ABP1 gene, coding DAO enzyme, have been associated with a reduction in DAOactivity and accumulation of histamine. Objective: The present study aims to demonstrate the negative effect that the variants rs10156191, rs1049742 andrs1049793 have on DAO plasma activity in Caucasian male patients with clinical manifestations associated with hista- mine intolerance. Methods: We analyzed 78 white male patients with a clinical manifestation associated with histamine intolerance. Variants analyzed were genotyped and reduce signicantly DAO plasma activity. Factors such as worsen- ing symptoms after eating a diet rich in histamine or NSAID-type drugs (non-steroidal anti-in flammatory) are associated with a greater number of alternative alleles in theSNVs analyzed, and reduced DAO plasma activity. Conclusions: These results show the predictive value of this genetic study in patients who have a clinicalmanifestation associated with histamine intolerance. J. Vinas-L\u00f3pez: C.

Yeltsin, Yekaterinburg, Russian Federation Introduction: Classic galactosemia is one of the ve her- editary metabolic diseases, which has been included in the290 J. del PicchiaState Program of Neonatal Screening of the Russian Fed- eration in 2006. Aim of the study: To estimate the incidence of galactosemia in the Sverdlovsk Region based on neonatal screening data. Patients and methods: 698 550 children born in the Sverdlovsk Region from 2006 to 2019 were examined. Initially, the level of total galactose and galactose-1- phosphate was determined in a dry blood spot, then anactivity of the enzyme galactose phosphate-uridyl transfer- ase (GALT) has been selected as a biochemical marker of galactosemia. The diagnosis of galactosemia should then beconrmed by genetic analysis. Results: During the 13-year study period 657 newborns were included in the risk group and assigned for moleculargenetic testing. Eight children were identi ed as having classical galactosemia on the basis of the enzymatic and molecular genetic analysis. Moreover,142 babies had agalactosemia Duarte, another 134 had decreasing activity of the GALT enzyme due to non-genetic reasons. The spectrum of (6.2%), not described earlier. Conclusion.Based on the results of newborn screening programs, the prevalence of classic galactosemia in the Ural population is 1:87 318 live birth and unlikely that it will undergosignicant changes with further increase in the screening period.

P06.12.B What is beyond the congenital lactic acidosis? variants personalized Implementation of Next Generation Sequencing has dra- matically increased the diagnosis success-rate of highly heterogeneous inborn-errors of metabolism such as those underlying congenital lactic acidosis. However, the lack ofintegrated phenotypic data, the scarce number of datasets of global metabolomics and the necessary expertise to analyze the functional effects of variants of unknown signi cance, are limiting the transfer of genetic data into clinical practice. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the powerful of anadequate clinical-biochemical and genetic analysis to drive a clinical response in a timely manner preventing the use of major invasive techniques. With a pipeline that combined specic datasets from metabolomics sub-sections and phe- notypic information, with DNA and/or RNA analysis, we identi ed likely pathogenic variants in strong-candidate genes in 64% of a cohort of 39 patients with clinical sus- picion of congenital lactic acidosis. These variants, 14 of which were new, were found in 19 different nuclear and twomitochondrial genes. Speci c biochemical test and/or bioenergetics analysis in broblasts including measures of oxygen consumption rate, steady-state levels of OxPhosproteins using Blue-native geles, and changes in mito- chondrial morphology, sustained the diagnosis for patients carrying novel genotypes. RNA analysis contributed tosolve miss or undiagnosed patients, providing a direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by speci c genetic changes. Finally, by rescuing normal splicing in aGFM1-patient cells carrying in heterozygous fashion the c.689+908G>A change with antisense oligonucleotide treatment, we corroborated the importance of molecularanalysis to investigate personalized therapeutic options.

Three major reasons are; diabetes, hyperinsulinism and ketotic/non-ketotic hyperglycemia.The brain accounts for 60% of the glucose consumption in the infants 'resting state, leaving the brain vulnerable to hypoglycemia. Tight plasma glucose control is ensured by anumber of complex mechanisms. In the majority of cases the underlying pathophysiology are unexplained. The goal in the presented study was to nd new reasons underlying these disorders. 38 families were included for trio analyses performing exome sequencing for germline variation.

Candidate genes was analyzed by in vitro studies using RIN-m -cell lines and KO of target genes using siRNA or Crispercas9. Measurement of RNA expression levels was performed by Q-RT-PCR or micro-array analysis. Insulin measurements were performed. In 10 (26%) cases the hypoglycemia was explained. In three ketotic hypoglycemia patients the reason was found ina known GSD gene, four patients was explained by novel genes. In one diabetic and one hyperinsulinism patient a novel genetic cause was found. A single hyperinsulinismpatient was explained by a previously undetected mutation in a known hyperinsulinism gene. 10 additional candidate genes are currently under in vitro cellular investigation fortheir role in manifestation of disease in individual families.

Laranjeira 1,2, is an X-linked progressive inborn error of metabolism originated by mutations in the GLA gene causing a de ciency of the lysosomal ( -Gal) hydrolase impaired and the lysosomal substrate accu- mulation triggers the onset of this lysosomal storage dis- order. Male patients usually present very low -Gal activity and marked substrate accumulation, and at least some of the clinical hallmarks. In females, however, there is a wide range of phenotypes leading to great controversy regardingclinical diagnosis and therapeutic decisions. Patients and methods Data concerning leukocytes and plasma -Gal activity together with plasma and urine substrate accumulation for 141 males and 210 females were obtained. Correlationamong biochemical parameters and with the molecular defect was evaluated. Results: 37 genetic variants were found and the most prevalent genetic variant is c.337T>C p.(F113L), found in 50% of males and females. Males usually present a correlation of reduced -Gal activity with increased substrate accumulation. In this group it was possible to identify some genetic variant-speci c patterns. Heterozy- gous females show less pronounced effect on substrateaccumulation and enzyme de ciency. The variability of patterns within carriers of the same genetic variant is also noticed. Conclusions: Some genetic variants whose pathogenicity is controversial are indeed associated with milder biochem- ical phenotypes. Plasma -Gal activity is not recommended as only diagnosis testing because in the presence of speci c variants it may give false negatives. Heterogeneity among heterozygous females should be further evaluated withrelation to X chromosome inactivation pro le. F.E. Laranjeira: None. P. Rodrigues: None. C. Case- iro: None. I. Ribeiro: None.

Bardey 1, Rieck1, GmbH, Mannheim, Germany Introduction: A sizeable proportion of patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) do have the monogenetic familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). It remains dif-cult to clinically distinguish FCS from the multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome (MCS) in the absence of genetic testing. Our aim was to characterize the genotype ofour HTG patients with respect to MCS and FCS as well as to apply the clinical FCS-score proposed by Moulin and colleagues. Methods: We studied 90 genotyped patients with severe HTG in our clinic during the last seven years. We classi ed the identi ed genetic variants (SHERLOC-criteria), fol- lowed by categorization into MCS or FCS. Clinical data were gathered from the medical records and the FCS-score was calculated for each patient. Results: The gene sequencing revealed ten FCS patients. Four were compound heterozygous and six were292 J. del Picchiahomozygous for a pathogenic variant. Another 53 patients were categorized as MCS, of which seven were hetero- zygous carriers of a pathogenic variant. Altogether, we found 16 pathogenic variants of which six have not been described before. The most common was a missense variant (c. 644G>A, p.G215E) in the LPL gene. In 27 (30%) of our patients we were unable to detect any genetic alterations. In our cohort the FCS-score yielded a sensitivity of 80% and a specicity of 92.5%. Conclusions: At 11% the prevalence of FCS among our patients with severe HTG was higher than expected. The FCS score performed similar to the original study, however20% of the FCS patients will not be detected correctly, relying on the score only. F. Bardey: None. L. Rieck: None. D. Spira: None. W.

Methods: We performed RNA-seq on 37 (16 and omental Asian obese patients,obtained during bariatric weight-loss surgery. DESeq2 was used for differential expression analysis. Results: 266 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed higher and 197 showed lower expression in T2DM vs non-T2DM samples ( Padj < 0.05). We identi ed GABRB2 as the top novel upregulated gene, highlighting a role for GABAergic system in omental fat with T2DM while ACVR1C expression was most signi cantly down- regulated and loss of function variants in ACVR1C have been reported for reduced central obesity and T2DM risks. Upstream regulator analysis using our DEGs revealed OSM as the most signi cant regulator of up-regulated DEGs and PPARG for down-regulated DEGs. Pathway-based analyses using our DEGs connected with OSM revealed signi cant associations for immune-related pathways, validating recentassociations of increased HMGB1 and TREM1 signaling for increased T2DM risks. Similar analyses on PPARG revealed pathways associated with adipogenesis, glucoseand lipid metabolism and validated the protective associa- tion between increased Apelin signaling in omental fat and T2DM. Conclusions: Our study on omental fat identi ed novel DEGs associated with T2DM. Omental from T2DM subjects exhibit upregulation of immune pathways probablymodulated by OSM, and downregulation in genes involved in adipogenesis, glucose and lipid metabolism probably modulated by PPARG.

How the different domains of PPAR exactly communicate on intra- and intermolecular level to generateAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 293the appropriate transcriptional output in the context of chromatin is unresolved. New insights can be obtained from natural PPARG mutations, as found in patients suffering from familial partial lipodystrophy subtype 3 (FPLD3), characterized by repartitioning of adipose tissue causing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We identi ed two FPLD3 mutations (E379K and R212Q) - located in distinct PPAR domains - that impair the adipogenic capacity. Methods and materials: We have used genome-wide sequencing-based in PPARG knockout mouse embryonic broblasts transduced with PPAR to determine how these PPARG mutations affect the ability of PPAR to activate PPARG target genes in the context of native chromatin structure. Results: Both mutations impair the ability of PPAR to induce an overlapping subset of target genes, including classical PPAR target genes such as Lpl, while retaining the ability to activate other genes including Acox1 . Genome-wide DNA binding pro les indicated that regula- tory regions that require PPAR for chromatin remodeling are particularly sensitive to the mutations. In addition, theexact nucleotide sequence of the PPAR binding sites can potentially contribute to target gene sensitivity. Conclusions: We propose a model in which recruitment of PPAR to chromatin is determined by multiple protein- protein and protein-DNA interfaces. Our ndings indicate that relatively subtle molecular defects in PPAR are sufcient to cause lipodystrophy by dysregulating a subset PPAR target genes. None. Stahl None. A.M. None. F.C. Holstege: None.

We report a new case diagnosed during pregnancy presenting cardiacmalformations (Shone syndrome with high risk of aortic coarctation) and progressive intrauterine growthretardation since 20w with preserved head circumference and abdominal perimeter, with out renal malformations or vertebral segmentation. Prenatal exome revealed a homozygous frameshift mutation in exon 1 of the HAAO gene (p.R15Gfs*99). The parents were heterozygous car- riers and referred non-consanguinity. After birth thelength was -3.2SD, we performed an abdominal ultra- sound (normal), skeletal X-rays (normal) and cranial MRI (normal). The patient had elevated levels of 3-hidroxyanthralinic acid (3 HAA) and 3-OH-kynurenina and normal levels of niacin, si m i l a rt ot h et w op r e v i o u s l y reported cases.

It is therefore vital to know that competitively funded research meets the needs of patients and their clinicians. The Priority Setting Partner- ships (PSPs) are an established, collaborative methodologythat brings patients, charity representatives and clinicians together to try to establish the most pressing and unan- swered research priorities for a particular disease group. Methods: After a scoping exercise to identify relevant partners, we chose to include questions relevant to both children and adults with primary mitochondrial disorders. Aweb-based questionnaire was developed and widely dis- seminated; asking for patients, carers and clinicians to pose their important research questions. This yielded 709questions from 50 patients, 47 carers and 50 clinicians. These were grouped in to themes and ltered to exclude statements that were personal stories. Extensive literaturesearching was performed to determine which questions are unanswered based on current evidence. This process resulted in a list of 42 discrete questions. In a secondweb-based questionnaire, patients, carers and clinicians were invited to rank these 42 questions. This identi ed 24 questions that were taken forward to a workshop attendedby a diverse range of patients, carers, charity representatives and clinicians.

A pathogenic variant, which is present in an affected offspring, is often not detectable in various tissues of the mother, and therefore classi ed as \"de novo\". Here we present a case, where an apparent \"de novo\"variant is actually not de novo, as it is detectable by high coverage NGS in the mother and other maternal relatives. Case: The male index patient is affected by Leigh syndrome, a classical mitochondrial disease. Symptoms are psychomotor delay and generalized dystonia and MRI brainscans show bilateral symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Muscle biopsy showed ragged red bers. Mother and grandfather are affected by Parkinson\u00b4s disease. Results: Whole exome sequencing identi ed pathogenic variant m.10158T>C in mtDNA isolated from blood. Highcoverage NGS revealed that the variant is present in this sample with heteroplasmy of 62% (2710 of 4371 reads). Testing of mother and healthy siblings showed that thevariant is present in all investigated tissues with low heteroplasmy (~1%). Therefore the variant is inherited. Discussion: Apparent de novo mtDNA-variants may be inherited and maternal relatives may be carriers of such variants. High coverage NGS of mtDNA can detect such cases. Increase of heteroplasmy in cases like this must bedue to a strong bottleneck effect. If the bottleneck works by unequal partitioning (segregation), at least 6 cell divisions without mtDNA replication must have happened in thereported affected case. U. Ahting: None. B.

A correct diagnosis is challenging due to the com-Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 295plexity of the clinical presentations, lack of classical diag- nostic clues and genetic heterogeneity. Patients and methods: In this study, mtDNA was examined in a cohort of 71 affected individuals (69 unrelated families) with suspected mitochondrial disorder. Comprehensive analysis of mtDNA was performed usingfollowing molecular genetic methods: Sanger sequencing of whole-length mtDNA for detection of point long and for detection of number analysis. patients were identi ed with pathogenic mtDNA variants in the cohort of 69 unrelated patients. Common mtDNA pathogenic variant NC_012920.1:m.3243A>G with variable heteroplasmylevels was identi ed in three unrelated female patients with phenotype MELAS.

A combined genomic and tran- scriptomic approach was adopted to diagnose mitochondrial disorders in a cohort of 14 Maltese patients. Phenotypic datawas recorded in the RD-Connect PhenoTips instance. The nuclear and mitochondrial genome were evaluated by whole exome sequencing. Variant RNA sequencing. Differential expression of candidatevariants was con rmed by q-PCR. A HEK-293 cell model was used to functionally characterise the effect of a rare homozygous missense variant on mitochondrial complex 1activity in one of the patients. Pathogenic variants were characterised according to their functional roles in OXPHOS biogenesis (see Table). The most variants wereidenti ed in Complex 1 OXPHOS subunits (N =8) and Complex 1 assembly factor variants were also identi ed in 4 of these patients. Two patients were diagnosed withMELAS. Gene expression analysis also revealed the effects of genomic and transcriptomic approach could aid in establishing a diagnosis for these rare disease patients. J. Vella: None. S. Laurie: None. L.

Pediatrics, Paracelsus Medical Austria account for an impor- tant subgroup of neuropediatric conditions but often theclinical presentation may be too unspeci c to hint to an a priori disease hypothesis. Materials and Methods: We report on a deep phenotyp- ing and trio-WES study of 492 unrelated children affected by previously undiagnosed and diverse complex neurope- diatric disorders. All children underwent a standardized andcomprehensive clinical work-up and trio-WES. In a subset of 31 children we had an a priori clinical suspicion of a mitochondriopathy. Results: Within this group of patients with a clinical suspicion of an underlying mitochondriopathy, we con- rmed the diagnosis by identifying a pathogenic variant in a known mitochondriopathy-associated gene in 9/31 children (29%). In 10/31 children (32%) we discovered a pathogenic variant in a disease gene not associated with a mitochon-driopathy. For 3/31 children we detected a pathogenic mutation in a candidate gene for a mitochondriopathy. In the group of 461 children with no suspicion of amitochondriopathy, we identi ed pathogenic mutations in known mitochondriopathy-associated genes in 13 children (3%). In 226/461 children (49%) we detected pathogenicmutations in other known disease genes. For 222/461 (48%) patients no de nite genetic diagnosis could be established. Conclusions: Overall, we molecularly established the diagnosis of a mitochondriopathy in 22 of 492 (4,5%) unselected neuropediatric patients. This study highlights the importance of WES for the identi cation of children with a clinically less characteristic presentation of their underlying mitochondriopathy. A. van der Ven: None. J.

Lord, J. L. Elson Newcatsle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom Introduction: Mitochondrial disorders are heterogeneous, showing variable presentation and penetrance. Over the last three decades, our ability to recognize mitochondrialpatients and diagnose these mutations, linking genotype to phenotype, has greatly improved. However, it has become increasingly clear that these strides in diagnostics have notbeneted all population groups. It has been suggested that haplogroup (or lineage) context might in fluence the pre- sentation and penetrance of mtDNA disease; thus, thespectrum of mutations that are associated with disease in different populations. Methods and Materials: This paper conducted the most extensive investigation to date into the importance of haplogroup context on the pathogenicity of mtDNA mutations. We searched for proven human point mutationsacross 726 multiple sequence alignments derived from 33 non-human species absent of disease. Results: 58 pathogenic point mu tations arise in the sequences of these species. We assessed th e sequence context and found evidence of population variants that could modulate the phenotypic expression of these pointmutations masking the path ogenic effects seen in humans. Conclusions: This supports the theory that sequence context is in fluential in the presentation of mtDNA disease and has implications for diagnostic practices. Our current understanding of the pathogenicity of mtDNA pointmutations, primarily built on studies of individuals with haplogroups HVUKTJ, will not present a complete picture. This will impair our understanding of disease mechanismsand create a diagnostic inequality, whereby individuals who do not belonging to more commonly studied lineages will be less likely to receive a genetic diagnosis.

The classical phenotype is late infantile pre- senting with language developmental delay, with its clinicalsigns usually appearing between the ages of 2 to 4 years with seizures and a rapid decline of psychomotor functions. Most children are bedridden at 5 years and die around theage of 10 years. Nevertheless, atypical phenotypes have been reported in the literature, creating a clinical challenge to avoid diagnosis without signi cant delay. Methods: Clinical, biochemical and neuroradiological data retrospective analysis of ve CLN2 patients showing atypical/protracted phenotypes Results: All four patients (3 males; 2 females) showed an atypical late onset phenotype. First symptons started around 5 - 10 years of age being cerebellar ataxia the mostprominent feature. Abnormal ndings in brain MRI were found in all patients (cerebellar atrophy and periventricular white matter changes). Seizures were present in threepatients, cognitive decline was seen in 4 patients and mild learning disabilities in one. TPP1 enzyme was decreased in all patients, although not in the typical range found in\"classical \"CLN2 patients. Discussion: The protracted CLN2 phenotype was pre- viously considered globally rare. In South America, thefrequency is approximately 50% of affected individuals. Recently with the recent approval of intraventricular enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with cerliponase alphafor CLN2 disease, early diagnosis is essential to start treatment before disease progression.

Guatibonza , C. Beetz, J. Gutierrez, A. Rolfs Pick disease (NPD) geneti- cally and clinically heterogeneous group of lysosomal sto- rage disorders. A deeper insight into NPD would bene t from large and uniformly characterized cohorts of patients.We queried our database for patients that had received a genetic diagnosis of NPD between December 2015 and August 2019. Information was compiled on: affected gene,age, gender, and country of origin, along with available clinical and metabolic data. A genetic diagnosis of NPD was issued for 733 patients. With n =472 (64.4%), the majority had variants in NPC1 , while SMPD1 andNPC2 were identi ed as the affected genes in 255 (34.8%) and 6 cases (0.8%), respectively. Most patients were infants(median age at diagnosis 3.6 years; range 0 to 76 years). They had been referred from 52 distinct countries, with the top 4 countries (Iran, Germany, Brazil and Egypt) collec-tively accounting for more than 50% of referrals. Transla- tion of the available clinical information into human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms revealed that hepato- and/or splenomegaly was in 76.5% of patients, intel- lectual disability in 27.9%, and jaundice in 19.0%. Further frequent HPO terms (i.e. present in >10%) included,abnormality of movement, ataxia, failure to thrive, and seizures. The NPD-speci c biomarker LysoSM-509 was pathologically increased in 97.9% of the patients. Ourcohort is amongst the largest described to date. By being well-characterized at numerous levels, it represents a valu- able basis for discovering novel correlations and, thereby,for increasing our understanding of Niemann Pick disease. P.

Methods: To identify the causative variant, DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of the child and exons were captured and enriched to perform whole exomesequencing (WES). Data were analyzed using bioinfor- matics techniques and in silico predictors. Conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to con rm the ndings in WES. Additionally, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-array was carried out to study the accurate size of the copy number variation (CNV). Results: Surprisingly, no pathogenic phenotypi- cally related disorders 'genes. the probably low coverage, we analyzed the PCCA andPCCB regions in the BAM le. In the PCCA unlike PCCB , exons 12 to 21 were identi ed with no coverage, probably suggesting deletion of the approximately 220kb-size region. Not only we con- rmed the novel PCCA deletion via PCR but also performing CGH-array revealed the approximate deletionsize of 160Kb. Conclusions: We identi ed a novel homozygous deletion in the PCCA in the patient with PA using WES. Our results showed that WES can be used for identifying CNVs instead of CGH-array. However, a lot of studies should be done to improve the accuracy of this approach. S. Farajzadeh Valilou: None. H. Heydari: None. S. Shohani: None. S. Samadpour: None. H. Abdi: J.

Hearing loss is present in all of these patients. CMTX5 patients additionally presentwith peripheral neuropathy and optic atrophy. Arts syn- drome includes developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia and susceptibility to infections. Case report: We report a boy who presented with marked generalized muscular hypotonia, progressive global developmental delay, lack of speech, trunk instability,exercise intolerance, hypomimic face with opened mouth, oropharyngeal dysphagia, dysarthria, and very frequent upper respiratory tract infections. Cardiac, audiological andophthalmological investigations were normal. A novel hemizygous variant c.130A>G p.(Ile44Val) was found in thePRPS1 gene by panel sequencing. PRPS activity in erythrocytes was markedly reduced con rming the patho- genicity of the variant. In retrospect, serum uric acid levels and the rst urine purine/pyrimidine analysis were normal, but analysis of the follow-up sample showed nearly absent hypoxanthine. Conclusions: We describe a patient with features of Arts syndrome and a novel PRPS1 loss-of-function variant. However, at the current age of ve years, our patient does not present with hearing loss, which has so far beenreported in all of the Arts syndrome patients as congenital/ early-onset. We would also like to emphasize that the rstAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 299purine/pyrimidine analysis was normal giving no clues towards a dysfunction in the purine-pyrimidine metabolism.

The rst cases in Russia . 1Research centre for medical genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Voronezh Regional Clinical Consulting and Diagnostic Center, Voronezh, Russian Federation,3Asso- ciation of Neuromuscular Disorders deciency muscular atrophy (5q) (SMA-5q) are two potentially curable hereditary diseases with different levels of damage to the neuromuscular system and etiology. Early childhood forms have a similar phenotype and aredifcult for differential diagnosis. We present the clinical characteristics and molecular defect of MM with TK2 deciency and informing health care specialists about the possibility of optimizing differential diagnosis. Materials and methods. This study involved 9 patients with excluded SMA-5q diagnosis. TK2 mutations were detected by NGS- gene panel in 3 of them. In addition, 96 DNA samples of patients with SMA-phenotype were screened for TK2 mutations by Sanger sequencing. Results. Nine patientswith MM with TK2 from 6 unrelated families have been diagnosed. Three of them have been found retrospectively by analysis of 96 SMA-5q negative samples. Screening formutations in the TK2 gene can be recommended for all children with a manifestation of the disease up to 2 years old, with rapidly progressing muscle weakness, increasedCPK and/or lactate in the blood and/or detection of damage to the leg muscles on MRI.

P06.44.A TYPE 2 DIABETES AND CANCER CO-MORBIDITY: IS THERE SHARED GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY? L. Zudina 1, A. . Uni- versity of Surrey, Guildford, United Kingdom,2Nutrition and Metabolism Section, International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, Lyon, France A plethora of epidemiological studies showed relationships between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and common cancers,reporting increased risks for postmenopausal breast (RR=1.20), colorectal (RR =1.30) and pancreatic (RR=1.94) cancers, and decreased risk for prostate cancer (RR=0.84) in T2D patients. We aimed to dissect the genetic factors shared between T2D, pancreatic and three common cancers using genome-wide genetic variability in a largecase-control and population-based context. We evaluated the role of signals established for T2D on the susceptibility to postmenopausal breast, prostate, color-ectal and pancreatic cancers in EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) a combined nested case-control study of 14,553 individuals, including 4,345/2,120/426/499 with postmenopausal breast/colorectal/pros- tate/pancreatic cancer diagnosis and 476 prevalent cases of T2D. We generated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for breast/colorectal/prostate/pancreatic cancers and T2D using 171/ 90/154/21 and 403 established DNA variants for each disease, respectively. To perform reciprocal evaluation ofPRS effects on diabetes and four cancer risks, we used the variants from original phenotype and the estimates of per- allele genetic effects from the other outcome. For all individual PRSs, we observed signi cant (P < 5x10 5) increase in the risk of original outcomes. T2D PRS was signi cantly associated with risk of pancreatic cancer (OR=3.82[1.65-8.84], P =1.71x103). This effect was stronger compared to the T2D PRS effect on T2D risk (OR=1.53[1.35-1.75], P =9.87x1011). and LINC-PINT/KLF14 loci only. Using the pan-European EPIC study data, we provide evidence for shared genetic factors between T2D and pancreatic cancer. Funding: WCRF-2017/1641300 J. del PicchiaL. A. None. I. Pupko: None. M.J.

Brennerova2, Borecka1, Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia,2Department of Pediatrics, Medical Faculty of Commenius University and National Institute of Children 's Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia,3Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institute of Children 's Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia Introduction: Vici syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome caused by mutations in the gene EPG5 encoding ectopic P granules protein involved in autophagy. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder with multisystem involvement callosum agenesis, cataracts, hypo-pigmentation, cardiomyopathy, and immunode ciency. It has been hypothesized that the severity of phenotype is related to residual level of functional EPG5. Patient: A 4 years old boy of Roma ethnicity with preterm birth, hypotonia, severe hypotrophy and growth retardation, developmental delay, mild brain atrophy, andurine organic acid pro le suggesting mitochondrial disease was referred for whole-exome sequencing. Results: We have found a novel variant c.4205G>A (p. Arg1402Lys) in the EPG5 gene. As it is the last base of exon 23, we performed a mini-gene assay to estimate its effect on splicing. This has shown decreased inclusion ofexon 23 compared to wild-type (40% vs. 72%, respec- tively). RNA sequencing con rmed only presence of the correctly spliced transcript. The patient was furtherexamined for symptoms common in Vici syndrome and hypopigmented skin areas and immunode ciency were conrmed. Interestingly, the patient has present corpus callosum, although thin, no seizures, no cataracts and no cardiomyopathy. Additionally, he has hemodynamically important stenosis of left pulmonary artery. The typical sign- pale skin and hair were also not present. Conclusions: Novel variant c.4205G>A causes aberrant splicing only in a proportion of transcripts, therefore, milderpresentation of Vici syndrome in our patient is probably due to the residual presence of the EPG5 protein.

P07 Immunology and Hematopoietic System P07.05.A A rare pair in one patient - Bernard-Soulier syndrome unraveled by 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome Riga, Latvia,2Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia,3Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Riga, Latvia Introduction: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is one of the most common microdeletion syndromes. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, in turn, is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder (prevalence <1:1 000 000) with dysfunctionalglycoprotein Ib-V-IX complex, responsible for the adhesion activity of platelets. We report a patient having both diseases. Case report: A boy who was admitted to hospital on the third day of life due to epistaxis, petechias and umbilical cord bleeding. Brain MRI showed subdural hematomaamong cerebellar lobes. Blood count revealed severe thrombocytopenia (8 x 10 3/uL), that required several platelet infusions and did not improve with immunoglobulintreatment. An NGS analysis for Bleeding disorder gene panel was ordered, with CNV analysis. On the second month of life flow cytometry revealed reduced CD42b expressivity. Results: The NGS gene panel results revealed a heterozygous pathogenic 22q11.2 microdeletion, encom-passing 73 genes with GP1BB gene included. The analysis also showed a heterozygous likely pathogenic variant in GP1BB gene c.395T>A, p.(Leu132Gln). The combination of the microdeletion on one and the mutation on the other GP1BB allele explains the bleeding disorder of our patient and con rms in him Bernard-Soulier syndrome. 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome was not suspected before the DNA analysis. Afterwards at a repeated consultation the patient demonstrated signs of velopharyngeal insuf ciency but as yet no other signs of the Velocardiofacial syndrome. Conclusions: In patients with early onset bleeding disorder genetic testing with CNV analysis must beperformed in order to not miss an autosomal recessive disease unmasked by a seemingly presymptomatic frequent microdeletion syndrome.

Here, we report a CDA family with a novel homo- zygous mutation in C15orf41 , one of six CDA associated genes, and unusually high intrafamilial clinical variability. The proband, 3-month-old male born to consangineous parents, presented with transfusion-dependent anemia, malnutrition, recurrent pulmonary infections, hypotonia,refractory seizures and cerebral atrophy. His affected sibling had a milder neonatal anemia with no additional exome (c.58C>A,p. Pro20Thr), which is not present in GnomAD and also found in the affected sibling. Another mutation in thiscodon (c.58C>T,p.Pro20Ser) had already been associated with CDA. In order to discover a second mutation that may explain the neurological ndings in the proband, we focused on twelve >4Mbp runs of homozygosity and detected a nonsense mutation in C2orf69 (c.929G>A,p. Trp310Ter), which is absent in GnomAD and in-housedatabases. No other family member was homozygous for this variant. C2orf69 is highly uncharacterized, but we predict that absence of any homozygous truncating muta-tions in GnomAD indicates selective pressure on C2orf69 . A high expression in brain is apparent in GTEx dataset. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a novel mutation in C15orf41 affects a hotspot codon leading to CDA. In addition, we associate biallelic mutations in C2orf69 with intractable infantile epilepsy.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterizedby driven by excessive activation and expansion of macrophages and defective Natural Killer (NK) cytotoxicity; it can be fatal if untreated. Here, we identify apreviously unrecognized hematological and autoin flammatory condition in four this new syndrome, we performed phenotype and whole-genome/exome analyses. In silico,in vitro and in vivo ( C. elegans ) assays allowed to characterize the impact of mutation on localization and function. Results: All patients shared the same de novo CDC42 mutation (Chr1:22417990C>T, p.R186C) and altered hematopoietic compartment, immune dysregulation, andinflammation. We documented unique effects of the p. R186C on CDC42 localization and function. Indeed, CDC42^R186C showed impaired interaction with knownCDC42 regulators and effectors, rearrangement and reduced growth andmigration, which likely underlie the distinctiveness of the trait of this syndrome. Aberrant CDC42 function caused defective NK cytotoxicity, which likely contributes to theHLH phenotype. Timely therapeutic neutralization of IL-1 and IFN was critical to the survival of one patient, who underwent successful bone marrow transplantation.

Viken University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Introduction: CFS/ME is a chronic debilitating disease of unknown origin and cause, but a heritable component is implicated, likely harbouring a multifactorial aetiology Evidence from recent studies suggest an involvement of theimmune system as well as a high degree of comorbidity with other autoimmune disorders. This has led us to explore the genetic architecture of CFS/ME to further explore theimmune component of this pathology. Previous genetic studies of CFS/ME were limited by heterogeneous diag- nostic criteria as well as sample size (<100 patients),thereby lacking statistical substance. Materials and Methods: We have genotyped 426 CFS/ ME patient (diagnosed according to the strict Canadiancriteria) and 973 controls with the Illumnia immunochip. The Immunochip is designed to screen for more than 250,000 common genetic variants covering genetic regions,previously associated with autoimmune and in flammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Results: Our analysis has shown 16 signi cant and close to signi cant (P values ranging from 6.35E-14 to 9.90E-05) genetic associations with CFS/ME scattered over several different chromosomes. The most robust nding is a block of 4 genetic variants located on chromosome 2. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, our study is therst of this magnitude in CFS/ME. The results from our discovery cohort are promising and replication studies in 2 different cohorts are in progress at the time of writing this abstract (independent Danish cohort with >700 samples anda UK Biobank cohort with >1500 samples).

Scheijen Radboudumc, Nijmegen, NetherlandsAbstracts from the 53rd of Conference: Interactive e-Posters 303Introduction: Diffuse large B-cell aggressive with a 30-40% relapse rate after rst- line chemoimmunotherapy treatment. Some patients develop multiple recurrences, but the clonal relationship between the initial diagnosis and subsequent lymphomas is not routinely assessed. The molecular mechanisms under-lying therapy response or failure are still poorly understood. To support diagnostics, guide therapy choices and even- tually improve outcome of patients with DLBCL, we aim todene the clonal relationship and mutational landscape of DLBCL recurrences. Materials and Methods: In a cohort of 37 matched DLBCL diagnosis and one to three relapse biopsies, clonality analyses were performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of immunoglobulin (IG) gene rearrange-ments. The clonotypes for the different IG gene rearrange- ments were identi ed by ARReST/Interrogate bioinformatics. Mutation analysis by whole exome sequen-cing is currently being performed on a subset of the paired diagnosis-relapse samples. Results: IG-NGS clonality analyses on matched diagnosis- relapse(s) revealed identical dominant clonotype(s) in 33/37 of the recurrences, even in cases with an interval period of 14 years. However, in 4/37 DLBCL patients, at least one in of the cases, suggesting the occurrenceof second primary lymphoma, possibly linked to a genetic predisposition or immunode ciency. Our cohort of clonally related cases will be subjected to mutational analyses todene the patterns of clonal evolution and identify genes related to therapy resistance. These studies will help to dene the genetic landscape of relapsed DLBCL. M.R. Berendsen: None. M. van den Brand: None. J. None. G. Astuti: None. Scheijen: None. P07.17.A Clinical and cytogenetic assessment in a cohort of Egyptian patients with Fanconi anemia: A 10 year experience M. Farid 1, M. M. Thomas2, G. Y. Kamah2, M. M. Eid1 1Human Cytogenetics Department, Human Genetics and Genome Division, National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt, 2Clinical Genetics Department, Human Genetics and Genome Division, National Research centre, Cairo, Egypt Introduction: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Common clinical presentations includeprogressive bone marrow failure, abnormal skin pigmenta- tions, skeletal malformations and high risk of malignancy. Due to its rarity and heterogeneous presentation, it is rather challenging to establish a de nite registry on a national level. Therefore, this study describes the FA cases in the NRC 10 year registry, focusing on family history, clinical,hematological and cytogenetic ndings. Methods: This study included 225 patients. Their age ranged from 4 months to 26 years. All patients weresubjected to thorough clinical examination, pedigree construction, hematological and radiological investigations. Cytogenetic assessment using diepoxybutane(DEB)-induced chromosomal breakage was done to differentiate Fanconi anemia from acquired aplastic anemia. Results: 131 patients (58%) showed positive chromoso- mal breakage and were diagnosed with FA. 93% of them were of consanguineous parents and 21% showed positive family history as an affected sibling. Clinical examinationshowed; limb anomalies (20%), abnormal skin pigmenta- tion (31%), bleeding tendency (22%) and kidney anomalies (10%) of the cases. Hematological investigations showed:cytopenia in one or more of blood cell types (52%), bone marrow failure (42%) and 34% had received blood /blood products at least once at the time of diagnosis. Cytogeneticstudy showed mosaicism in 10% of the FA cases which is signicant for treatment assessment. Conclusions: This study is the rst to present the clinical and cytogenetic characterizations of a cohort of Egyptian FA patients. Further large scale studies are needed to identify the prevalence of FA in the Egyptian society. M. Farid: None. M.M. rare pustular skindiseases S. HaskampInstitute of University Hospital Erlangen, Germany Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a systemic in flammatory IL-36 carry bi-allelic mutations in IL36RN , the majority of patients do not carry mutations in known genes. In order to identify and char- acterize new pathways involved in the pathogenesis of performed whole exome sequencing in 31 GPP patientsand demonstrated effects of mutations in MPO encoding the neutrophilic enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) in myeloid304 J. del Picchiacells. We discovered eight MPO mutations resulting in MPO-de ciency in neutrophils and monocytes. Mutations were associated with GPP, primarily those resulting in complete MPO-de ciency (p =3.49E-10; OR =8.63). Dosage of mutant MPO alleles showed signi cant differ- ences between 82 patients and >3,600 controls (p =2.67E- 10); this effect was stronger when including IL36RN mutations (p < 2.20E-16) and correlated with a younger age of onset (p =0.0018). Activity of four proteases, previously implicated as activating enzymes of IL-36 precursors, cor- related with MPO-de ciency. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps =0.015). Phagocytosis assays in MPO-de cient mice and human suggested that altered neutrophil function together with impaired clearance ofneutrophils by monocytes (efferocytosis) allowed prolonged neutrophil persistence in patients MPO mutations contribute signi cantly to GPP 's pathogenesis. Our study implicates MPO as an in flammatory modulator in humans by regulating protease activity and NET formation, and modifying efferocytosis. Our ndings con ne using MPO inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases. MPO and affected pathways represent attractive targets for inducing resolution of inflammation in neutrophil-mediated skin diseases.

Cavdarli Wollnik2 1Ankara Bilkent City Hospital, Ankara, Turkey,2Institute of Genetics, Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany Introduction: Genomic instability syndromes are a group of inherited disorders that include a high variety of symp- toms such as congenital anomalies, bone marrow failure,and cancer susceptibility. Fanconi Syndrome(FS) is a rare syndrome belonging to this family characterized by neuro- developmental delay, radial-ray defects, microcephaly andprogressive de ciency of bone marrow production. Material and Methods: We present a 33-year-old female who was monitored for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Clinical ndings of the patient included short stature, microcephaly, neuro- developmental delay, patchy hypopigmented dark-colored skin, signs of premature aging and chronic liver disease. Results: Chromosomal breakage rate was detected high after mitomycin-C(MMC) treatment of cells suggesting chromosomal instability syndrome. We performed whole-exome-sequencing on the DNA of the index patient and her affected brother who had parental consanguinity. Weidenti ed an intronic variant, c.1114-8G>A in FANCE that was homozygous in the index patient as well as her affected brother, and it is predicted to generate a new acceptor splice-site resulting in alternative-splicing and premature protein truncation (p.Ile372Leufs*2). So far, this variant has only been described in a single case also of Turkish originwith a similar phenotype. Besides this patient, there are currently only four additional patients carrying biallelic mutations in FANCE. All of these patients were diagnosedin the rst decade of their lives. Conclusions: We expand the clinical spectrum of patients with FANCE mutations and show that the absence of renal,cardiac and radial ray anomalies might be the cause of late diagnosis of FS caused by FANCE mutations.

Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic,2Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China,3Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is always present in plasma, and it is utilized in prenatal diagnostics as well as in oncology and transplantology for therapy ef ciency monitoring. But does the cfDNA have a physiological role? Here we show thatcfDNA presence in plasma of healthy individuals plays an indispensable role in immune system regulation. We exposed THP1 cells to healthy individuals 'plasma with (NP) and without (TP) cfDNA. In cells treated with NP, we found elevated expression of genes whose products main- tain immune system homeostasis. Exposure of cells to TPtriggered an innate immune response (IIR), documented particularly by elevated expression of pro-in flammatory interleukin 8. The results of mass spectrometry showed ahigher abundance of proteins associated with IIR activation due to the regulation of complement cascade in cells cul- tivated with TP. Our results provide evidence that the pre-sence of cfDNA in plasma of healthy individuals blocks fundamental mechanisms of the in flammation process. The expression pro les show that this process could play an important role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis. This nding epitomizes one of many intriguing properties and features of the human immune system. Its detailed under-standing is of crucial interest for future medical applica- tions.

Common genetic variants inunderlying genes have been linked to various in flammation- mediated diseases and pathogen induced cytokine respon- ses, but the role of rare variants remains to be elucidated. Inthis study, we characterize the role of rare and common genetic variation in 48 genes related to the IL-1 pathway, onin vitro stimulation-speci c human cytokine responses from 463 healthy individuals. We identi ed strong NCF4 and CASP1 rare variant associations with cytokine induced phytohaemagglutinin (P =7.2E =3.0E05). Additionally, com- mon variants in IL36A andIL38 were associated respective IL-30 subpathway level (IL-1 P=0.0017; IL-6 P =1.8E04). The nature for the immunological response to C.albicans was conrmed by an group (IL-1 P=1.87E03; IL-6 validated this for non-coding common variants. Lastly, we detected an association between inpro-in flammatory genes and LPS-induced IL-6 cytokine (P=2.42E a role for anti-in flammatory genes on S.aureus induced IL-6 produc- tion (P =6.71E03). In conclusion, we show that both common and rare genetic variation in genes of the IL-1 pathway differentially in fluence in vitro cytokine responses to various stimuli in healthy individuals. This study there- fore provides insight into potential mechanisms relevant for the characterization of genetic variant involvement invariability of immune responses and possibly in flammatory- mediated diseases.

P07.28.C Correcting clinical diagnosis with targeted immunde - ciency gene panel sequencing: the critical role of geneticcounselling K. 1, 1PentacoreLab Ltd., Budapest, Hungary,2Semmelweis University 1st Department of Internal Medicine, Budapest, Hungary Immunode ciency results from a failure or absence of ele- ments of the immune system including lymphocytes, pha- gocytes and complement system. Theseimmunode ciencies can be either primary such as Bruton 's disease or secondary as the one caused by HIV infectionIn our case, a 35 years old healthy female patient was referredto our lab, who lost two of her brothers with severe immunode ciency. She is about to have her rst child and306 J. del Picchiawanted to be tested before the pregnancy. The suspected familiar diagnosis, based only clinical symptoms, was X- linked agammaglobulinemia which is a X-linked mono- genic disorder. After sequencing of the BTK gene, MLPA were carried out, both returned with negative results. After second genetic counselling it was revealed by the counsellorthat the suspected phenotype is not t entirely and targeted gene panel test was ordered, included 200 genes which are linked to immunode ciencies. A pathogenic heterozygous deletion in the CD40LG gene (c.67dupA) was identi ed, which is a known cause of X-linked immunode acterized by normal or elevated serum IgM levels associated with markedly decreased IgG, IgA, and IgE, resulting in a profound susceptibility to bacterial infections and anincreased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Patients also tend to have neutropenia, as well as a high rate of gastrointestinal and central nervous system infections.Based on estimation only 20% of patients will reach the third decade of life.

Here we report the case of a 22-months-old Caucasian boy present-ing with high fever and lethargy ve days after live- attenuated MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. Laboratory lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), with pro- gressive decrease in cell blood count, hyperferritinemia, elevation of liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase andhypobrinogenemia.Materials and Methods: Clinical Exome, using a custom panel including 6920 genes known as associated to genetic diseases, was sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq6000 \u00aeplat- form. In silico analysis was performed on the basis of the patient 's clinical phenotype. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the patient and his familyand stimulated with IFN or IFN ; phosphorylation of STAT1 and Type I and II IFN signatures were analyzed by FACS analysis and RT-PCR. Results: We identi ed the two novel frameshift mutations c.234delT and c.555_559delAAAAG, in a compound heterozygous status, studies on patient 's PBMCs conrmed the defect in the activation of the type I IFN signaling, but not in type II IFN response. Treatment with high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone allowed a progressive improvement of patient condition and ofclinical and laboratory features. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that HLH episodes following administration of live-attenuated MMR vaccinecould suggest the presence of a defect in the type I IFN response. C. Passarelli: None. A.

Increased levels of circu- lating IL-6 in blood is associated with the pathophysiology of complex disorders like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascularand autoimmune diseases. Albeit, IL-6 levels are heritable with estimates up to 61%, only a few common genetic loci associated with circulating IL-6 levels have been identi ed. We therefore conducted a two stage (discovery and repli- cation) meta genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating serum IL-6 concentrations comprising up to67,428 individuals of european ancestry.

Different compound KIR-HLA genotypes can impart dif- ferent thresholds of activation to the NK repertoire and such genotypic variation has been found to confer altered risk in a number of human diseases including infectious diseases.The aim of this study was to establish and analyze the spectrum of KIR-HLA genes in people with a con rmed diagnosis of CF, homozygote of F508del mutation of the FTR gene for understanding the genetic predisposition of congenital immunity key part functioning during CF. Results: KIR andHLA class I ligands (C1,C2) genes dis- tribution was established in 48 CF patients and 104 prac- tically healthy individuals of control group. HLAC genotypes frequency did not differ in the CF group and inthe control. The lower frequency of KIR2DL3 ,KIR2DS1 and KIR2DS4 genes (37.5%, 6.25% and 0%) was found among CF patients (p < 0.05) compared to control group(67.3%, 20.2% and 10.5%) indicating a strong inhibitory effect on NK cells. Respectively, the frequency of KIRBB haplotype 8.34% in CF patients was signi cantly higher compared to the control 0.96 % (p < 0.05). Analysis of combined frequencies for iKIR+HLA (>=<)aKIR+HLA showed no signi cant difference between the study groups. iKIR+HLA aKIR analysis showed signi cantly lower fre- quency iKIR+HLA<aKIR combinations in the CF group compared to controls (p < 0.05). Thus, the results indicatethat people with cystic brosis have genetically predis- possition of weak activation and a strong inhibition of NK functional activity, that possibly contributing to bronco-pulmonary infection process development.

Clinical features in individual patients can be highly variable, ranging from mild arthritis, skin manifes-tations and antinuclear antibody production to life- threatening organ disease. SLE exhibits a striking female predominance, with ratios exceeding 9:1. The disease oftendisplays a more aggressive clinical course in men, resulting in poorer prognosis. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this gender bias, including X-chromosome inactivation, sex hormones and TLR/miR- NAs altered expression. Methods: By employing data from mRNA sequencing in whole blood samples from 142 SLE patients and 58 healthy volunteers we explore gender/disease speci c patterns of gene expression and their putative functional gene networksas suggested by DAVID analysis. Results: Genes displaying a stepwise up-/down-regula- tion upon comparison of their expression in the order ofhealthy males (HM), healthy females (HF), affected females (AF) and affected males (AM) groups, were the most over- represented among all possible combinations. These genesappeared to belong to pathways highly relevant to SLE pathogenesis, including NOD-/Toll-like p-values < 0.05). Conclusions: Although preliminary, our results suggest that gender bias may - at least partially - be re flected by patterns of altered expression of genes/pathways relevant to SLE. Future analysis in lupus mouse model will reveal genetic impact on gender-speci c gene expression. K. Varvagiannis: None. D. Gerasoudis: None. A. Filia: None. N. Panousis: None. E. Dermitzakis: None.

Passos2,J Brazil Introduction: Studies have showed the importance of microRNAs in Down syndrome(DS) pathology and impaired T cell proliferation may result of altered micro-RNAexpression. Therefore, in this study we investigated the relationship between expressionpattern of hsa-miR- 378a-3p, hsa-miR-668-3p and hsa-miR Material Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 52healthy individuals with fulltrisomy 21 (DS) (age 1 to 20) and 53 healthy control (HC) (age 1 to 12). MicroRNAs expression was investigated by real time polymerase chainreaction using Taqman assays.Statistical analysis was performed using One- SampleWilcoxon Signed Rank Test, in the GraphPad Prism 6 software. Bioinformatic analysiswas carried by expressed differentially RNAs andthe interaction between proteins using MiRTar- base and STRING t-v11.0 tool. Results: DS individuals over-expression of hsa-miR-378a-3p 36.70, 48.68; respectively, P=0.007). analysis showed that genes regulated by hsa-miR-378a-3p and hsa-miR-668-3p are signi cantly involved in cell differentiation, celldivision, cell cycle (P=<0.001) and regulation of cell growth (P =0.02). Conclusions: The lower lymphocytes concentration in DS may in part explain the highfrequency of immune alterations. Genes that regulates the lymphocyte concen-trationsare probably affected by impaired microRNA expression. MicroRNA target genes areinvolved in biolo- gical process \u00c9.C. Pavarino: None.

Laboratoryexplorations showed a normochromic, normocytic anemia, normal ferritin level, liver and kidney function, deciency, but also immunological abnormalities: IgA, IgG2 and IgG4 de ciency, poor response to vaccination, low memory B cells and a normal number of T cell subpopulations. Ophthalmologic examination was normal.The cerebral MRI-scan highlighted multiple 0,5 and 4 cm in diameter tumors. The cerebral biopsy revealed a diffuse astrocytoma IDH mutant and she started chemotherapy.Taking in account the consanguinity, family history and the negative clinical exam of the parents we performed genetic exam - WES that revealed a pathogenic homozygousc.2653A>T mutation in MSH6 gene, parents being carriers for the same mutation. Conclusions: Homozygous mutation in MSH6 gene is a very rare type of immunode ciency from DNA repair syndromes and it must be suspected in atypical cases of neuro bromatosis associating immunological abnormal- ities.

Here, we attempt to detect causal mutations in three paediatric patients with possible presentationsfor MSMD. Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed on two patients with severe localized BCG infection (#1 and #2)and their parents, and another individual patient with disseminated TB (#3). The functional effects of the identi ed variants were characterized using RT-PCR analysis ofendogenous and transcripts, and SPRi analysis. Results: Six rare variants detected addition, disease-associated variants in three presumed causative genes were de HEATR3 #1), c.373-2A>C in STAT1 demonstrated in STAT1 pre-mRNA splicing. Characterization the c.1149 +14T>C variant via minigene assay revealed some exon-skipping event fromthe mutant construct. Additionally, analysis showed a greater af nity of silencer-bound hnRNP A1 protein to RNA oligonucleotides harboring c.1149 +14T>C compared to the wild type oligonucleotides, providing support to the minigene assay. Conclusions: Our ndings expand the spectrum of genetic variation possibly predisposing to mycobacterial infections in children. Funding: Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and Hanover Uni ed Biobank.

We leveraged the rich phenotypic data in the UK Biobank to identify genetic loci that in fluence response to multiple infections. Methods: We undertook 45 genome-wide association studies of antibody responses against common pathogens,in 9,611 participants from UK Biobank, identifying NFKB1 as a common locus. Using incidence of disease in 487,409 UK Biobank participants, we investigated the associationbetween NFKB1 variation and 91 infection and in flamma- tion phenotypes. To better understand the impact of variation on underlying immune mechanisms, we alsoexplored the effect of these variants on eight blood cell traits and cellular expression data. Results: We identi ed an insertion-deletion variant (rs28362491), known to affect NFKB1 promoter binding, as a likely causal variant. The insertion allele has a protective effect against infection, but increases the risk ofallergic disease. The same variant was associated with shifts in haematopoietic pathways, and likely impacts cell survival, antibody production and in flammation. Interest- ingly, this variant is relatively common in all human populations, suggesting that variation within this locus is largely maintained through balancing selection. Conclusions: Wend that disruptions to the tightly regulated immune responses and in flammatory processes can tip the balance between exacerbated immune responsesand allergy, or increased risks of infection and impaired resolution of in flammation. This subtle yet demonstrable effect across the population is likely driven by modulationofNFKB1 gene expression. A.Y. Chong: None. N. Brenner: None. A. Jimenez Kaufmann: None. None. J. Fellay: None.

However, the reasons for clonal expansion in an acquired loss of function of GPI biosynthesis, is still amatter of debate. Here we describe, how PNH also mani- fested in a patient with essential thrombocythemia (ET) after a copy number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in PIGV , another gene Similar to other proliferative myeloid malignancies, the clonal expansion of the HSC with ET resulted in our casefrom a de novo mutation in MPL (p.W515L) on chromo- some 1 (1p34.2). 16.7 MB upstream of the acquired MPL mutation in cis, the patient carried a heterozygouspathogenic mutation in PIGV (p.R469X, 1p36.11), con- genitally. A in the HSC comprised almost the entire p-arm of chromosome 1. Hence, the MPL mutation p.W5151L gained dominance and deteriorated ET and while homozygosity of p.R469X in PIGV resulted in a GPI-anchor de ciency and manifestation of PNH. In addition to ET and PNH, the patient presented with nephrotic syndrome that ceased after treatment with eculizumab and hydroxycarbamide. We determined theorigin of kidney injury as a result of podocyte instability due to an increase of non-GPI linked soluble uPAR. In this report we identi ed PIGV as a novel gene causing PNH and provide insights into the pathomechanism of acquired GPI anchor de ciency and expansion of PNH cells. Further- more, we discuss the contribution of PNH to kidney injury. A. Maurel-Ribes: None. A. Knaus: None. C. Garcia: None. H. Engels: None. S. Sivalingam: None. H. Hundertmark: None. D. Ribes: None.

There remains an incomplete understanding of the potential impact of humangenetic variation on inter-individual responses to polyomaviruses. Material and methods: To identify human genetic determinants of the humoral immune response against polyomaviruses, we performed genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses of immunoglobulin G (IgG)responses against the major capsid protein VP1 of Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6), BK virus (BKV), JC virus (JCV) and WU polyomavirus (WUPyV), using data from threeindependent studies grouping 15 '660 individuals of Eur- opean ancestry. Results: We found evidence for an involvement of HLA class II variation in the determination of antibody responses to JCV (P =1.5e-78) and HPyV6 (P =3.2e-14). We also observed associations in ABO for JCV (P =6.2e-11), and FUT2 =9.7e-26; respectively), involved in blood group determi- nation and secretor status. Lastly, we found a functionalvariant in MUC1 , previously associated with the risk of developing gastric cancer and Helicobacter pylori asso- ciated gastritis, againstWUPyV (rs4072037, P =3.6e-33).Conclusions: These results provide insights into the human genetic control of a family of very prevalent viruses, highlighting polymorphisms that play a modulating role on the humoral immune response against speci c human polyomaviruses. Functional follow-up studies will be needed to uncover the biological mechanisms responsiblefor the newly discovered associations. F. Hodel: None. A.Y. P. H. Ehren- reich: None. N. None. A.J. C.

Niskakoski , Alastalo Blueprint Genetics, Espoo, Finland Background: Finding the genetic diagnosis for patients with suspicion of primary immunode ciency (PID) is becoming increasingly important in the management of primary immunode ciency and estimating the risk for family members. Simultaneous sequence and copy numbervariant analysis combined with customized analysis for difcult to sequence regions in speci c genes such as NCF1 improves the diagnostic yield in patients suspected for PID. Methods: A retrospective review of nearly 1700 patients suspected for PID and referred for genetic testing at Blueprint Genetics between 2018 and 2019 was performed.Patients were tested with Blueprint Genetics next generation sequencing panels related to immunology. Results: Diagnostic yield including all immunology related panels was 14.9% (253/1698). The diagnostic yield was highly variable between the different panels; diagnostic yield for Primary Immunode ciency Panel was 13.3% (138/ 1036), whereas Immunode ciency Panel it was 46.7% (7/15). The diagnostic yield for Chronic Granulomatous Disease Panel is high (10/21, 48%)although analysis of the NCF1 gene included in this panel is complicated by two highly homologous pseudogenes NCF1B and NCF1C . Out of the 296 reported diagnostic sequence variants, 234 (79%) were unique, and only 7 diagnostic variants were reported over 3 times. Copy number variants, including deletions and duplications, werereported for 19 patients from 17 different genes.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 313Conclusions: We constantly increase the diagnostic yield for PIDs by improving the sequencing technology, updating the panels with new genes discovered related to PID, and nding diagnoses from dif cult to sequence regions and regions with high homology.

PsA is considered a T-cell mediated disease with a complex genetic basis. To date, GWAS identi ed >60 mostly uncertain. RUNX3 encodes a tran- scription factor expressed e.g. in immune cells, including T- cells, and skin. As genotyping arrays had insuf cient SNPs for furtherne-mapping. Association analysis in 3,049 PsA patients and 6,178 controls of the Psoriatic Arthritis Genetics in Europe consortium showed signi cant association to an LD-wise isolated intronic SNP (p SNPs in high LD (r 20.9) with the SNPs were inconclusive, including histone modi ca- tions and DNAse-sensitive sites in immune cells. Haplotype and conditional analyses, though, pointed to disease-contribution of the common, evolutionary conserved var- iant c.53T>A/p.Ile18Asn CD8 +T-cells unveiled alternative splicing in homozygous wildtype carriers, but a reduced number of splicing products and lack of alternative splicing in homozygous risk-allele carriers. Comparativetranscriptome analysis in CD8 +T-cells of homozygous carriers provided evidence for differentially expressed involved in T-cell exhaustion signaling, Th1/ Th2 activationand T-helper-cell differentiation. Our study indicates that theRUNX3 risk-allele in PsA reduces splicing variability thereby contributing to altered signaling, activation anddifferentiation of T-cells.314 J. del PicchiaU.D.

Previously, peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) was identi ed as a susceptibility gene for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by genome-wide association studies in Japanese population. PADI genes can provide peptidyl citrullinewhich is a target antigen of anti-citrullinated peptide anti- bodies (ACPAs) that is highly sensitive and speci c anti- bodies in RA. After that, PADI2 was also identi ed as susceptibility gene with RA. But, it is not clear how these PADI genes are involved in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to investigate the rela-tionship between PADI4 gene and PADI2 gene in the progression of RA. To clarify the physiological function of PADI4 and PADI2, we used collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), known as a RA model mouse. We examined that localization of PADI4 and PADI2 protein was indicated by immunohis-tochemistry in CIA mice. We also measured expression of PADI genes and various in flammatory cytokines in immune cells generated PADI4 /and PADI2 /mice, and performed experimental arthritis. We demonstrated that the clinical disease score was signi cantly decreased in PADI4/mice and PADI2 /mice. PADI4 expression was induced by CII immunization. Interestingly, PADI2 expression was compensationally induced in CD11b +cells of However, mice, conpensational of PADI4 not and PADI2 enhancecollagen-initiated in flammatory responses. A.

BCL11B heterozygous loss-of-function variants have been associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder,alterations in the T-cell development and reduced number of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Moreover, a single patient presenting with syndromic features and severecombined immunode ciency (SCID) due to a pathogenic missense variant in BCL11B has been reported. Here we report a newborn with developmental SCID diagnosedthrough neonatal SCID screening based on T-cell receptor excision circles. The child presented with microcephaly, hirsutism, loose skin folds and dysmorphic facial features,which include eyebrows, hypertelorism, short palpebral ssures, broad nasal bridge, anteverted, small nares, upper and lower lip vermillion and long philtrum.

Bioinfor- matic prediction algorithms suggest this missense variant binds to identical alternative genomic sequences, resultingin acquisition of novel DNA-binding regions, as the pre- viously reported one. Thereby, providing an explanation for the striking clinical similarities of the two missense cases.Our ndings further suggest that only result in a severe immunode ciency.

They are de ned by a sig- nicant de ciency in T lymphocytes. Patients with SCID are asymptomatic at birth but infections can lead to their early death unless appropriate treatment is applied. A 10 day oldgirl, born to consanguineous Lebanese parents was referred to our Medical Genetics Unit for genetic evaluation, because of a family history of SCID. Lymphocytic immunophenotypingand serum immunoglobulin testing revealed a low absolute lymphocyte count, T cell lymphopenia with a signi cant decrease in na\u00efve T cells and normal circulating B cells countincluding mainly immature B cells. SCID/atypical SCID was suspected in the patient. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was conducted and did not reveal any mutation in the SCIDgenes. However, reanalysis of WES data showed the presence of a homozygous missense variant, likely pathogenic, in the DNMT3B gene (NM_ 006892; c.2477G>A, p.R826H).

Institute of Technology, Brno, Czech RepublicShwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder that include pan- ciency, hematologic dysfunction, and skeletal abnormalities, Haematological malignancies occur in one third of patients. SDS is caused by homozygous orcompound heterozygous mutations in SBDS gene. We present a sibling pair with mild to moderate neutropenia, episodes of autoimmune hemolysis andrecurrent infections of the oral cavity and respiratory airways. Prior investigations were inconclusive. Family history suggested AR mode of inheritance. We performedwhole-exome sequencing of siblings and parents. Whole- exome libraries were prepared according to the Nimblegen Exome v3 protocol and sequencing wasperformed on NextSeq 500 for all of them. Furthermore, we performed in silico analysis of a virtual gene panel, focused on congenital neutropenias. Whole-exome sequen-cing identi ed a compound SBDS gene in both siblings. We identi ed a likely pathogenic missense variant c.355T>C; p.(Cys119Arg) inexon 3 of SBDS gene, leading to substitution of strongly conserved cysteine for arginine. This variant has been previously reported in a French family with SDS (Donadieuet al., 2012). Furthermore, we identi ed a rare, previously undescribed missense variant, analysis(Align SIFT, MutationTaster) predicts pathogenic or likely pathogenic effect. Molecular-genetic analysis of parents con rmed heterozygous carrier status. Compound heterozygous mutations in SBDS leads to disruption of SBDS gene and clinical manifestation of Shwachman- Diamond syndrome in the siblings.

In chronic infections, the interplay between human and viral genetics contributes to HBVevolutionary changes. Here, we use a genome-to-genome (G2G) approach to identify sites of host-pathogen genomic interactions. Materials and Methods: We obtained paired human exome and HBV genome data from 424 chronically infected individuals of Asian ancestry from three Phase3 studies evaluating tenofovir-based regimens. For each variable HBV amino acid, a genome-wide association study was conducted using generalized linear mixed models andcontrolling for human and viral population structures. Results: We identi ed strong associations (p =1.9E-12) between an Asian-speci c missense SNP in the SLC10A1 gene encoding the HBV receptor NTCP (rs2296651) and amino acids in HBV large surface (preS1 domain) and polymerase proteins. The minor allele is present in 7% ofEast Asians (1KG Project) and was previously reported to associate with decreased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic HBV. We also identi ed signi cant associations (p =8.7E-13) between variants of HLA-A protein and amino acids in HBV polymerase and core proteins. Conclusions: Our joint analysis of human and viral genomes shows that variation in NTCP exerts selective pressure on HBV during chronic infection, and con rms the impact of HLA class I variation on HBV epitopes. These results demonstrate the power of the G2G approach to identify host restriction factors and identify speci c HBV amino acids likely to be involved in the interaction between HBV and its cellular receptor.

Andersen1 1University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States,2Uni- versity of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States Introduction: Smoking causes epigenetic changes asso- ciated with in flammatory diseases and elevated mortality. Of particular interest are changes in the level of T cellsexpressing G-protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15), a che- mokine receptor linked with in flammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Accordingly, a betterunderstanding of the mechanisms by which smoking influences variation in GPR15 +T cell subpopulations is of potential interest. Materials and Methods: Flow cytometry and digital PCR assays were used to measure the GPR15+CD3+CD4+ helper T (T h) populations in peripheral blood from n=62 primarily African American young adults (aged 27-35 years) with a high rate of tobacco and cannabis use. Results: Tobacco and cannabis smoking predicted GPR15+(Th) cell levels using linear regression models. Methylation of two candidate CpGs, cg19859270, located inGPR15 signi cant pre- dictors of GPR15+Thcell levels, mediating the relationship between smoking and increases in GPR15+Thcells. As hypothesized, the interaction between cg05575921 and cg19859270 was signi cant, indicating that low cg05575921 methylation was more strongly associatedwith GPR15 +Thcell levels for those with lower cg19859270 methylation. Smoking leads changes in two CpGs, cg05575921 and cg19859270, that mediate 38.5% of the relationship between tobacco and cannabis smoking and increased GPR15+Thlevels in this sample. The impact of cg19859270 in amplifying the association between cg05575921 and increased GPR15+Thlevels is of potential theoretical interest because it may re flect a permissive interaction between different parts of the immune system.

P07.54.B in HLA loci in patients with myeloid leukemiaAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human blood transfusion, Prague 2, Czech Republic,2Institute of experimental cellular therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany Introduction: In the HLA department of Institute of hematology and blood transfusion in Prague we deal withHLA typing of hematooncological patients and their related/ unrelated donors. The best donor compatibility is important for succesful hematopoetic stem cell transplantation(HSCT). Materials and methods: Using NGS (Omixon, Hun- gary), we investigated more than 2000 patients and theirHSC donors. New alleles found were con (Inno-train, USA). Results: . From our recent studies (2017 - 2019), in our cohort of patients, 15 new alleles were detected. Two of them were a somatic mutation in patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML); one was in the HLA-B andthe other in the HLA-C locus. In both cases, the somatic mutation represents a single nucleotide polymorphism. Conclusions: Our ndings are in agreement with the known genome instability in AML. In the HLA region, somatic mutations are not so common, however, they should be given more attention since they can affect diseaseprogression and may impact also on HSCT.

Vran\u00e1: Moscow, RussianFederation, 2Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Rearrangements of T- and B-cell receptor (TCR and BCR) genes are useful markers for clonalityassessment and minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring during the treatment of hematological malignancies. Despite their estimated lineage, B-cell leukemias manifest a remarkably high incidence of TCR gene rearrangements. According to indirect estimation, TCR alpha (TRA) inci- dence in B-cell precursor ALL could reach 46%. Currently,rearrangements of all BCR and 3/4 TCR loci are used for this purpose with the exception of TRA due to the large number of multiplex primers needed to amplify all TRAsegments. Materials and Methods: We developed the rst targeted sequencing-based method for identi cation of TRA clonal rearrangements. gDNA was extracted from a bone marrow of children with B-ALL. Ampli cation of TRA rearrange- subsequentlysequenced platform. Results: TRA rearrangements were detected in 5/ 45 of TRA varied from 31% to 98% and corresponded to main leukemic clones. All found TRArearrangements were nonfunctional. TRA clones arose after leukemic transformation and have high clonal rate, which indicates these clones are most viable of all other leukemicclones. Conclusions: The innovative study provides pathbreak- ing analyses of TRA occurrence in B-ALL at the DNA leveland suggests that particular TRA rearrangements may be of clinical relevance in childhood B-ALL by adding a signicant marker to MRD detection panel based on TCR/BCR rearrangements analysis.

Hematology and Transfusiology Center, Baku, Azerbaijan, 3Department of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Thalassemias are de ned by the absence or decrease of globin chain(s), which may lead imbalances of318 J. del Picchiaglobin chains, ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and eventually to a variable degree of anemia. With the esti- mated carrier frequency of -thalassemia is 4%-8.6% in country, the importance of premarital genetic testing, informed family counseling and preventive medical treat- ment cannot be overstated. Screening for traits by hemo-globin electrophoresis and biochemical analysis has become a routine application test prior to the issuance of a marriage license throughout Azerbaijan. Methods: We aimed to evaluate prevalent mutations spectrum, the effect and their co-inheritance and/or role of polymorphisms (BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB and Xmn1 disease phenotype dot-blot hybridiza- tion using customized strips, sequencing analysis of the complete genes and MLPA. Results: We report here a summary nding of HBB gene analysis for 265 patients and HBA1 -HBA2 genes analysis for 28 patients, along with their family members totaling570 individuals. ; thalassemia -66 were found to have homozygous, 76 possessed compound heterozygous and 80 possessed heterozygous mutations. Overall, a total of 416alleles were found to have 34 mutations. The rst 20 frequented mutations covered 87% of the entirety of all mutations. The summary range 45 alleles revealed 9 mutations, the 3.7 kb deletion is the most frequent mutation (35.6%), followed by 20.5 kb deletion (24.4%) and 2 polyA2( HBA2: c.*92A > G, 13.3%).

Snyder2,P .W 1Global Health Institute, Lausanne, Switzerland,2Vander- bilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States Introduction: Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with asthma development. However, this association is confounded by shared heritability, andgenetic studies have focused exclusively on severe infection. Longitudinal, population-based studies of RSV infection arethus required to assess the causal association between RSV and asthma. To determine whether there are genetic variants involved with susceptibility or resistance to infection, we performed the rst GWAS on non-severe RSV infection. Methods: We performed GWAS analyses of healthy term infants in a population-based birth cohort (INSPIRE)specically designed to determine the effect of infant RSV infection on later child health. We compared infants who were and were not infected with RSV in the rst year of life as determined by biweekly surveillance for RSV infection and serology at age 1 year. Results: Among 1959 enrolled, 54% of infants were RSV infected and 46% were uninfected at age 1. There were signicant differences in environmental factors associated with RSV infection, including daycare (p =0.001), siblings (p=0.002) and black race (p =0.002). GWAS analyses of a subset of 663 participants with available genotyping data, adjusted for birth month, sex, race, daycare and siblingsrevealed no signi cant associations. Conclusions: We found no genome wide associations with risk of infant RSV infection; environmental factorswere signi cantly associated with infection risk.

AAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 319peculiar feature of this infection is the extreme variability in clinical presentation, ranging from very mild sub-clinical flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality. This heterogenous presentation poses the question whether individual variability of immune response to the virus can be in fluenced by genetic factors. Speci cally, it is unknown whether HLA and AB0 can explain the different prevalence in population of SARS- CoV-2 infection and its clinical evolution. To address thispoint, a retrospective analysis was performed on an Italian cohort composed by subjects who received organ trans- plantation and candidates in a waiting list in a 2002-March2020 time frame. A total of 56,304 cases were studied with the aim of comparing HLA and AB0 frequencies according to the presence (COVID +) or absence (COVID) of SARS- CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of COVID was 0.112% in the Italian population and 0.462% in waitlisted and trans- planted patients. HLA-B*51 and HLA-DRB1*08 weremore frequent in COVID +compared to COVID, while HLA-DRB1*07 showed a protective effect. In transplant recipients, HLA-DRB1*08 was an indicator of mortality(1.9% in living vs15.2% in the deceased, OR =9.4 95%CI [1.9-47.3]; P =.006). Moreover, blood group A was more frequent in COVID +(45.5%) than in COVID(39.0%). Overall, this study shows for the rst time that some HLA antigens in fluence SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical evolution and con rms that blood group A subjects are at greater risk of infection.

De cient expression or function of the maternally inherited UBE3A allele results in AS. Pathogenic UBE3A sequence variants (predominantly loss-of-function) account for ~11% of Angelman syndrome cases. maternally c.1900G>C (p.(Val634Leu)) variant of signi cance was identi ed in a seven- year-old male with clinical features consistent with Angel- man syndrome (although no seizures noted). This variantaffects the rst nucleotide of UBE3A exon 7 (transcript NM_130838.2) and in silico splicing tools predict weaken- ing of the canonical 3 '-splice site. Methods: RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing of gel-puri ed amplicons was performed on mRNA isolated from the proband and maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs). To detect aberrantly spliced transcripts targeted by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), PBMCs Results: TheUBE3A: a cryptic 3 'splice transcripts demon- strated an increase in the relative abundance of abnormallyspliced transcripts, suggesting targeting by NMD. The c.1900G>C variant was re-classi ed as a pathogenic. Conclusions: The maternally inherited UBE3A: c.1900G>C variant induces abnormal splicing of the predominant UBE3A isoforms expressed in blood and brain, introducing a frameshift consistent with the patho-genesis of Angelman syndrome. Therefore, UBE3A splicing outcomes observed in mRNA isolated from blood can inform the molecular consequences of cryptic splicevariants for diagnosis and genetic counselling of Angelman Williams: None.

We will provide insight inthe spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with ANK2 and explore the effects of ANK2 mutations on neuronal function. Methods: We describe clinical and molecular data of seven individuals with de novo loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in ANK2 . These patients were collected through our database, international contacts and contacting authors of previous reports. Furthermore, we generated a hetero- zygous loss-of-function of ANK2 using CRISPR/Cas9 in human stem cells (hIPSCs). HiPSCs were differentiated towards excitatory neurons to study neuronal function. We measured axon initial segment (AIS)plasticity, which plays an important role in regulating homeostatic plasticity in response to increased neuronal excitability. We stimulated ANK2- CRISPR neurons with KCl to chronic depolarization. We immunostained neurons for AnkG, a scaffolding protein that acts as marker for AIS. Results: All patients had intellectual disability or developmental delay. Six patients had a formal or suspected diagnosis of autism, four patients had early onset epilepsy.Two patients had concurrent cardiac abnormalities. All patients with neurodevelopmental disorders have LoF mutations, in contrast almost all reported patients withcardiac problem had missense mutations. Functionally, heterozygous loss of ANK2 causes a more diffuse AnkG staining and showed impaired AIS plasticity upon KCltreatment. Conclusions: We show that heterozygous de novo ANK2 LoF mutations cause a novel neurodevelopmental disorderwith early onset epilepsy. Furthermore, we showed thatheterozygous heterozygous LoF mutations in ANK2 affect neuronal function. M.W.A. None. E. D. None. M.R.F. Reijnders: None. R. Pfundt: None. S. M. None.

The function of this protein, and its role in human health is unclear. However, is highlyexpressed in the cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere regions of brain (gtexportal.org). It is hypothesized that ANKRD12 plays a role in inhibiting the ligand dependent transactivation by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the p160 coactivators/nuclear receptor complex. HDACs are involved in the regulation of gene expression. Patho-genic variants in another member of the Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein, ANKRD11, cause the KBG syndrome whose phenotypes include intellectual disability,developmental delay and seizures in some patients. Here, we report six affected individuals from three unrelatedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 321families variants in ANKRD12 . Four of these individuals are from a consanguineous Pakistani family, and have a homozygous non-synonymous variant c.3425A>C,p.(Lys1142Thr) in ANKRD12 (NM_015208.4). The other two are from the USA and carry compound heterozygous variants inANKRD12 ; c.4511C>T,p.(Ser1504Leu)/c.3375_3377del in one, and c.5251C>G, p.(Leu1751Val)/deletion of exon 1 of the transcript NM_001204056.1 in the other. Phenotypesnoted in these individuals include intellectual disability, aphasia, delayed motor milestones, hypotonia, mild hearing loss, and seizures (in one patient). Functional experimentsin drosophila are in progress and will be presented in the meeting. Further investigations need to be done to under- stand the disease mechanism. However, the phenotypicsimilarity of the patients and the expression data from GTEx indicate that pathogenic ANKRD12 variants may cause a recessive disease characterized by intellectual disability,developmental delay, hypotonia and mild hearing loss.

Genome-wide studies have suggested CAPRIN1 as a new autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can- didate gene. Interestingly, Caprin-1 +/-animal models show defects in the development of dendrites and dendritic spines and are characterized by a reduction in social interactions and lower response to novelty. Despite a clear involvementof Caprin-1 in neurodevelopment, the gene is still not associated with a human disease. Here we report the description of seven affected individuals with de novo andthree cases with inherited loss-of-function (LoF) variants in CAPRIN1 . Our cases show a broad spectrum of phenotypes, that ranges from ASD to language delay, intellectual dis-ability, attention de cit hyperactivity disorder and epileptic seizures. Other traits, such as abnormal facial features and skeletal anomalies are observed in subgroup of cases.CAPRIN1 is predicted to be an haploinsuf cient gene by computational pLI score (GnomAD). Taking advantage of the availability of patients-derived cells, we demonstrated ahalf-dose of CAPRIN1 mRNA levels, caused by nonsense mediated decay of the transcripts with LoF variants, that is followed by a parallel protein level half-dose. Our data laythe bases for further characterization of the involvement of CAPRIN1 in neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting the haploinsuf ciency of this gene as causative of a form of ASD with a possible incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.

By whole-exome sequencing, we identi ed a novel patient with a de novo likely pathogenic variant(c.1586A>G; p.(Asp529Gly)) and a familial case with three siblings who inherited a nonsense change from an affected mother (c.1357G>T; p.(Glu453*)). Moreover, we report ade novo 39-kb deletion encompassing TLK2 gene. Clinical phenotype included intellectual disability, facial dys- morphisms, microcephaly and anomalies of the hands asprevalent features, in accordance with previously reported cases.TLK2 is involved in many fundamental processes, including DNA replication, cell cycle checkpoint recoveryand chromatin remodelling, through its regulation of the ASF1 histone chaperone. TLK2 is essential in mice forplacental development but how TLK2 mutated protein affects central nervous system development remains largely unclear. Using spatial proteomics (BioID), we have inves- tigated the proximity interaction landscape of TLK2 and analysed the effects of missense mutations on TLK2 inter- actions, localization and activity. These results demon-strated that TLK2 activity is strongly impaired by the p. (Asp529Gly) mutation and identi ed new links between TLK2 and other proteins implicated in neurological dis-orders. Moreover, single cell gel electrophoresis demon- strated a more relaxed state of chromatin in lymphoblastoid cells harbouring the p.(Asp529Gly) variant compared tocontrol cells. In conclusion, our study has identi ed novel TLK2 -patient pathogenic variants and provided new insights into the role of TLK2 in intellectual disability. L. Pavinato: None. M. Villamor-Paya: None.

Schweiger1,3 1Institute of Human Genetics, University Medical Centre Mainz, Mainz, Germany,2Center of Molecular Biosciences (CMBI), Institute of Biochemistry, University of Innsbruck,Innsbruck, Austria, 3Leibniz Institute for Resilience Research (LIR), Mainz, Germany Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairment of communication and social interaction, as well as by high levels of repetitive behaviours. Due toatypical information processing within the brain, indivi- duals with Autism highly rely on predictable procedures, e.g. daily routines. Changes of these procedures increasesstress in the individuals. To investigate stress effects on autistic phenotype development, we used a Tsc2 hetero- zygous KO mouse model. Heterozygous mutations in theTSC1 or TSC2 genes, which both negatively regulated the mTOR kinase cause tuberous sclerosis, which is frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy. Weassessed sociability, anxiety, cognition and sensorimotor gating, and found signi cant de cits in Tsc2 heterozygousAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 323KO animals. In a second step we asked, how chronic social defeat stress affects the behavior of these mice. The chronic social defeat stress (CSD) procedure used had been shown to effectively induce a depression-like phenotype in wild- type animals. Interestingly, in Tsc2 heterozygous KO mice exposure to CSD stress lead to an improvement in somebehavioural domains including repetitive behavior, senso- motoric gating and working memory suggesting an inverse stress reaction in these animals. Proteomic analysis ofsynaptosomal fractions of the prefrontal cortex in stressed and non-stressed animals revealed a signi cant overlap of pathways affected in Tsc2 animals and stressed wildtypeand Tsc2 KO animals. This data suggests that the mTOR kinase is involved in the response following chronic social defeat stress and surprisingly point towards a potentiallybenecial effect of manageable stress in autistic children.

Moog1 Human University Hospital Heidel- berg, Heidelberg, Germany,2Center for Child Neurology and with neu- rodevelopmental disorders and dysmorphic features. Over 50 patients have been described, mostly carrying de novosingle exon deletions, including eight patients with exon 6 deletions. Small in-frame 5 'deletions have been associated with a mild phenotype and parental inheritance. Clinical Report and Methods: We report on two siblings, a girl and a boy aged 11 and 13 years, in whom we identi ed the same pathogenic 85 kb deletion on 7q11.22 encompassing exon 6 of AUTS2 by SNP-array and subsequent con rmation with MLPA and FISH. Both children had typical symptoms of AUTS2 -syndrome such as intellectual impairment and behavioral problems, but with markedly different expression. As in most children with exon 6 deletions, there were no feeding dif culties, which are otherwise common in AUTS2 -syndrome. We subsequently performed targeted testing of both parents. Results: MLPA and FISH excluded the deletion in blood samples of both parents. Conventional karyotyping did not show any structural rearrangements. Additional FISH analysis marking the flanking regions of the deletion showed normal arrangement of the signals on chromosome 7 in both parents. Parenthood was molecularly con rmed.Conclusions: We suggest germline mosaicism as the most probable explanation for occurrence of the same deletion in these two siblings. To our knowledge this is the rst report of germline mosaicism for AUTS2 syndrome. This report additionally provides further evidence of intrafamilial phenotypic variability and adds clinicalinformation to the phenotypic spectrum of patients with AUTS2 exon 6 deletions. L.

The aim was to ne-map breakpoints of de novo BCT in a female patient with the global develop-mental delay. At the age of 13 years she was referred to genetic counseling because of severe intellectual dis- ability, macrocephaly and the lack of the speech. Theautistic features and outbursts of aggression were also observed. Methods and results: Conventional G-banding karyo- typing revealed a genome-wide mate pair sequencing (SGMPS) was applied to identify the exact structure of the breakpoints in the translocation. The breakpoint onchromosome 13 disrupted the STK24 gene, while the breakpoint on chromosome 15 was located in KLF13 gene.324 J. del PicchiaDiscussion: The BCT identi ed in the presented girl disrupted genes with so far unknown ( STK24 ) or poorly delineated impact on the phenotype ( KLF13 ; only one previous report on mutation in this gene in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders). The function of STK24 and KLF13 genes will be discussed based on available literature data. Their role as good candidates for disease loci will be suggested. Conclusions: SGMPS in symptomatic carriers of BCTs is a powerful approach to delineate novel human gene-disease associations. This study was supported by the NCN Grant No. UMO-2016/21/B/NZ5/02541. M.

P08.013.A Unexpected phenotypic variability in a family with epilepsy explained by independent segregation ofbiparental CACNA1A loss-of-function variants C. migraine, 2, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, and neurodevelop- mental disorders. We now report on a family with ve members affected with variable CACNA1A -associated neurological pheno- types. The mother was diagnosed with episodic ataxia type2 due to the heterozygous mutation p.(Ala868Profs*24). A similarly affected son was tested negative for this variant. Three further children presented with severe muscularhypotension, refractory epileptic seizures, optic atrophy and dysphagia, fatal in all within the rst years. One of them was positively tested for the known maternal CACNA1A variant. However, as this was not suf cient to explain the very severe phenotype, we performed exome sequencing. Surprisingly, we identi ed a second heterozygous variant p.(His1826Thrfs*30) in the CACNA1A gene, which wasshown to be paternally inherited. The same compound- heterozygous situation was con rmed in material from one of the other two deceased children. Furthermore, the mildly affected son was found to be heterozygous for the paternal CACNA1A variant, thus con rming his initial clinical diagnosis of episodic ataxia type 2. In conclusion, we report two different variants in CACNA1A segregating in either heterozygous or compound-heterozygous states in a single family withvariable neurological phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is only the second observation of a severe, fatal epileptic encephalopathy associated with bi-allelic variants inCACNA1A .

Kl\u00f6ckner , R. A. Jamra, K. Platzer Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany Recent work on discovery of genes to cause neurodeve- lopmental disorders (NDD) has indicated that probably over1000 monogenetic causes, including those with reduced penetrance, remain to be discovered. To ful l the aspira- tions of personalized medicine and power downstreamresearch, a validation and extensive description of every candidate gene turned morbid gene is inevitable. This requires case-level evaluations to provide detailed pheno-typic information and functional validation on every gene that is usually beyond the scope of large meta-analyses such as DDD. If single exome sequencing of the index individual does not identify a genetic cause for NDD, we follow this up with parental exome sequencing on a research basis toidentify novel candidate genes. In a subset of 120 individuals consisting of 60 individuals with NDD + epilepsy and 60 individuals with NDD, we identi ed more than 150 candidate genes using our in-house scoring system of 0-15 points considering variant and gene attributes, literature research and inheritance. A prerequisite for all ourcandidate genes is a minimal expression in brain tissue derived from the GTEx database. Recurrent pathways with multiple candidate genes identi ed in our cohort include axon guidance, mTOR signaling, Ras signaling andAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 325regulation of transcription. As of now, we contributed seven patients to promising efforts validating novel NDD genes. At the time of the conference, we will present comprehen- sive data on our full cohort of candidate genes and progression on ongoing validation efforts. C. Kl\u00f6ckner: None. R.A. Jamra: None. K.

Biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) variants in CENPF gene are responsible for Stromme disease, a condition presenting with intestinal atresia, anterior ocular chamber anomalies, and microcephaly. Cases: Through an international collaboration, 5 indivi- duals (2 females and 3 males) carrying novel CENPF biallelic variants (1 missense and 4 LOF) were identi ed by ES. Four individuals were lacking the distinctive clinical abnormalities of Stromme disease, such as intestinal atresia or anterior chamber malformation of the eye. All individualshad microcephaly (average -3.2 SDS, ranging from -2 SDS to SDS) and developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). Genitourinary malformations (3/5), short stature(2/5), and epilepsy (2/5) were also observed. The ve individuals shared a recognizable pattern of dysmorphicfacial features with sloping forehead, flat philtrum, and anteverted nares. Discussion: ES is rapidly changing the diagnostic process and the 'genotype- rst'approach is rapidly becoming the method of choice. In the context of ES, reverse-phenotyping (i.e., re nement of clinical presentations in light of the identi ed genetic variants) is important for gene variant interpretation. The small case series of individuals with biallelic CENPF variants herein presented offers evidence Stromme disease. Microcephaly, DD/ID and dysmorphic features are consistent even in the absence of intestinal atresia or malformation of the anteriorchamber of the eye. M. Gensini: None. G. Cappuccio: None. S.

To date, six of the nine disorders. CHD3, CHD4 or nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, required for neural development. Material and methods: We assembled 10 unrelated individuals with a de novo CHD5 variant and a neurode- velopmental phenotype in different centers through Gene- Matcher. All patients were diagnosed through exomesequencing performed in a diagnostic setting. Results: The patients (seven males and three females) were aged 3-18 years old. They presented with moderate tosevere intellectual disability (ID) (8/10), speech impairment (7/10), epilepsy (7/10) - including suppression bursts (1/10), (3/10), generalizedtonic-clonic seizures (2/10) -, (6/10), and/or hypotonia (4/10). Brain MRI showed non-speci c white matter changes in two patients and focal cortical dysplasia in one. Of the ten de novo CHD5 variants, nine were missense and one was a splice site variant. Seven were absent from the gnomAD database,while three were present at a low frequency. Conclusions: Ourndings suggest that, in line with other CHD-related disorders, heterozygous CHD5 variants are associated with a variable neurodevelopmental disorder including ID, epilepsy and autism as the main features.

Engel1, A. etSyndromes Malformatifs and nonsense variants in CLTC are responsible for a form of intellectual disability (ID) with variable non- specic morphological features of autosomal dominant transmission (OMIM #617854). Since 2016, 32 patients with mild to severe ID have been reported in the literature [AS1], all carrying de novo variations. We report here newpatients carrying a pathogenic CLTC variant, including inherited mutations, suggesting the existence of familial forms. By a collaboration throught the French AnDDi-Raresreference centers network, we collected 10 patients (4 girls and 6 boys), from 8 families, with CLTC pathogenic var- iants (diagnosed by solo exome sequencing or presented with mild to moderate ID, variably asso- ciated with epilepsy, stereotypies, developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders. For ve patients, from three families, the variation was inherited from a parent initially considered asymptomatic, including one with a somatic mosaicism (52%). After being questioned again about theirpersonal history, it turned out that these parents had initially presented with learning dif culties or behavioural disorder and a favorable evolution. The identi cation of pathogenic CLTC variations inherited from paucisymptomatic parents allows us to envisage that this gene 's phenotype is not limited to the initially described forms, exclusively causedby de novo variations. Familial forms appear to be less severe and permit to expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with CLTC mutations. This work also illustrates how dif cult it is to interpret inherited variations, and that itAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 327is sometimes necessary to reconsider the initial clinical hypothesis with a more precise familial history.

Koolen2, NZ, Wellington Zealand,4Institute of Human Genetics, Technical University Munich, Munchen,Germany, 5Institute of Human Genetics, Technical Uni- versity Munich, Munich, Germany,6Hunter Genetics, Newcastle, Australia In 2012 we reported on a 16q23.2 de novo deletion in a patient with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delayand intractable epilepsy. The region contained CMIP as the only candidate gene for the clinical presentation of the patient. More recently we have gathered an additional 6deletion cases with CMIP as the only commonly deleted gene. Three of those were reported as de novo, in two cases the deletion was inherited and in one case parental testingwas not performed. One of the two inherited cases was from an affected parent. Two more de novo deletions were reported by others in the literature. In an additional patientwe diagnosed a de novo stop mutation in CMIP . Common clinical features of the patients include: developmental delay and intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorderand epilepsy. Other neurological symptoms are coordina- tion disorders and behavioural problems. CMIP encodes a protein that is part of the scaffold that links the plasmamembrane to the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal remodelling is essential in neuronal migration and synaptic formation. Association studies found an association between CMIP and speci c language impairment (SLI1). According to gnomAD, the gene is intolerant to genetic LoF variation (pLi=1). Thus, we report in total 9 CMIP containing deletions, the majority de novo or inherited form an affected parent and one de novo stop mutation. In combination with the predicted function of the gene our data strongly suggestthat haploinsuf ciency of CMIP is causative of Van der Aa: None. D. Koolen: None. K. Neas: None. T. Brunet: None. A.

We have identi and ARID1B (1), together with previously unidenti ed mutations in NIPBL (9), ANKRD11 (6), KMT2A, and SETD5. We have also identi ed plausibly causative DNM in the 5 'UTR (2) and deep intronic regions of NIPBL together with both balanced and unbalanced328 J. del Picchiastructural variants (SV) at this and other loci. In total WGS has identi ed a likely pathogenic variant in 30% of affected individuals providing a higher than expected diagnostic uplift from known loci.

It is involved in transcription- coupled histone modi cation, of the dopamine transporter. Through GeneMatcher, molecular and clinical data of 11 probands were collected. In all probands, whole exome sequencingidenti edCTR9 missense variants, encompassing 10 de novo and 1 inherited from an affected father. Recurrent patient ndings were intellectual disability, ranging from borderline to severe (10/11), speech delay (8/11), autism spectrum disorder (5/11) associated with regression and aggressive behavior during late childhood (3/11), hypotonia(6/11), joint hyperlaxity mild dysmorphism. EM and crystal structure modelling of the activated human tran-scription complex Pol II-DSIF-PAF-SPT6 and the PAF1/ CTR9 complex predict a likely disruptive effect on local CTR9 structure and/or protein interaction of the differentmissense variants. In yeast, the role of the PAF1C in H3K4 and H3K36 methylation is exerted by regulating the activity of Set1 Set2. Interestingly, pathogenic variants on thehuman of neurodevelopmental de cits. In skin broblasts from four of the CTR9 mutant patients, an effect on H3K4 and H3K36 methylation is currently under investigation. In conclusion, we describe a novel dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by (mainly) de novovariants in CTR9 , likely affecting PAF1C function. M.E.C. E. None. A. Verstraeten: None. J.

CYFIP2 plays an important role in the regulation of actin polymerization as a member of theWAVE regulatory complex (WRC) and in transcription regulation via the interaction with the fragile X mental retardation protein. We evidenced that the pathogenicCYFIP2 variants spatially cluster and are predicted to weaken the interaction of CYFIP2 with WASF1 or NCKAP1 of the WRC-complex. We now have identi ed further 18 patients harboring two previously described, one novel recurrent and 10 novel unique pathogenic missense variants, as well as the rst three loss-of-function variants. Genotype-phenotype correlation indicates a profound phenotype for substitutions at the mutational hotspot p. Arg87 and a more variable phenotype in other recurrentmissense alterations, while there is currently no evidence that haploinsuf ciency leads to a similarly severe pheno- type. Consistent with the role of CYFIP2 in WRC-mediatedactin polymerization our functional studies demonstrate aberrant regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in all six available patient broblasts. Our study further delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of this novel disease and provides evidence for WRC-mediated actin dynamics as a cellular pathomechanism.

PSD-95 protein, encoded by DLG4 , is located in the post- synaptic density and regulates excitatory synaptic maturationand function. Only a few patients heterozygous for pathogenic variants in DLG4 have been reported to date. The character- istic features include intellectual disability (ID) (some withmarfanoid habitus (MH)), developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia. Materials and Methods: A total of 44 patients (33 unpublished) were included. The unpublished cases were identi ed through GeneMatcher or Decipher and clinicalAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 331investigations were carried out by the local clinicians. Pathogenic variants in DLG4 were identi ed through next- generation sequencing (NGS) based technologies. Results: Mean age of clinical onset was 1.4 years and mean age at last evaluation was 14 years (1.5-47). The most frequent manifestations were developmental delay (25patients) (developmental regression; 12), ID (37)(severe 9, moderate 15, mild 9), ASD (20), epilepsy (19), ADHD (16), ophthalmological manifestations (16). MH was present in 5cases. MRI abnormalities were reported in 11 cases. Most of the DLG4 variants were truncating whereas 6 were missense, located in the functional domains of the protein.There were no differences in clinical severity between patients with the two groups of variants. Conclusions: Clinical manifestations associated with DLG4 variants are similar to those of other synaptopathies, mainly ID, ASD and epilepsy. MH is not a characteristic feature of the condition. NGS is fundamental to establish amolecular diagnosis, given the non-speci c clinical spec- trum here reported. A. Rodr\u00edguez-Palmero Seuma: None. M. Boerrigter: None. G. Mandrile: None. A.

P08.027.C Towards personalized treatment of Dravet syndrome using induced neurons as an ex-vivo tool E. J. H. van Hugte1,2,3, E. Lewerissa1,3, M. Frega1,3,J . Nicolai2, H. J. Schelhaas2,J .S . Verhoeven2, J. Netherlands Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by recurrent and prolonged seizures. Inaddition, DS is associated with substantial cognitive and neuropsychological decline as a result of seizures duringbrain development. It is therefore important to timely con- trol seizure activity. Although numerous antiepileptic drugs are available, it remains a challenge for clinicians to select effective drugs with minimal side effects for each speci c patient, and a predictive tool to investigate treatment options is lacking. Moreover, Dravet syndrome is asso-ciated with both genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which increases the complications of nding an appropriate treatment. ln 70%-80% of the cases, DS results from denovo mutations in the SCN1A gene, encoding the voltage gated sodium channel Na v1.1. Conversely, not every patient with a mutation in SCN1A develops DS, and also milder clinical phenotypes can arise. In addition to SCN1A , other genes have been associated with a DS phenotype. Animal models can neither recapitulate mutation-speci c effects nor genetic background factors, and are unsuitable for devising personalized medicine interventions. This research proposes the development of human induced pluripotent stem cells(hiPSC), differentiated into induced neurons as a patient- specic disease model. The neurons are cultured into a neuronal network on micro-electrode arrays (MEAs), ableto record network activity by embedded micro-electrodes. Here, we report a patient speci c neuronal network (PNN) ngerprint of DS on both the single cell and the network level. With this PNN, we aim to provide a predictive tool to model DS and to explore treatment options in vitro. E.J.H. van Hugte: None. E. Lewerissa: None. M. Frega: None. J. Nicolai: H.J.M. Reis2, C.

To screen for known and novel genetics causes of NDDs at scale we recently developed Exome Pool-Seq. Thisapproach combines DNA pooling and capture-based exome variant ltering in curated lists of known NDD genes and candidate genes. We now performed Exome Pool-Seq in a cohort of 576 individuals with unsolved NDDs, collected and clinically characterized by a collaboration of ve institutions from four European countries. Most individuals had previous normal microarray analysis (93.7%) and Fragile-X testing (67.7%). Remarkably, 48.7% already had gene panel testingwithout conclusive result. We identi ed (likely) pathogenic truncating or previously described variants in known NDD genes in 11.5%. Thisincludes four cases with truncating ANKRD11 and other commonly mutated genes like SYNGAP1 lighting a potential pitfall when ltering only for de novo variants. Analysis of missense variants absent from publicdatabases but predicted as deleterious by novel ensemble scores increased the diagnostic yield by 5.2%. Finally, we analyzed truncating variants in candidate and constrainedgenes and identi ed several candidate variants, e.g. in KMD2B and MARK2 , which have subsequently been submitted to matchmaking platforms. This study provides new insights into the clinical and mutational spectrum of a representatively pre-analyzed European cohort of individuals with NDDs and highlightsthe value of curated disease gene lists.

The DISSEQ study aims to assess the ef ciency of different NGS strategies in the diagnosis of patients with intellectual disability from acohort of 330 patients (205 males/127 females) without previous genetic investigation, using double-blind strategy 1 (array-CGH +FRAXA +large gene panel sequencing (459 genes)) and strategy 2 (FRAXA +exome (ES)). Preliminary results in 235/330 patients display a positive diagnosis in 85/235 (36 %) (62 SNV, 21 CNV, 1 FRAXA, 4 double-hits): 29.7% with strategy 1 and 30% with strategy 2. The results were concordant in 88%. Gene panel and ES iden- tied a positive diagnosis in 58/235 (25%) and 66/235 (28%), respectively. No SNV interpretation was missed in gene panel sequencing. Different reasons explain the defects in ES a solo strategy. But ES identi ed variants in new disease-causing genes, recently described and new candidate genes. For CNV diagnosis, gene panel sequencing appeared limited and required to be coupled with array-CGH, whereas ESappeared ef cient. Overall, solo ES obtain slightly higher results than gene panel but a trio-based analysis should be preferred for a greater ef ciency. Moreover, the possibility to reanalyze ES data confers a signi cant bene t due to the continuous development of knowledge. A. Bruel: None. B. G\u00e9rard: None. A. Piton: None. F.

P08.034.A DOES GENDER AFFECT THE FACIAL FEATURES OF FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME? EVIDENCE FROM A COHORT STUDY M. F. Urban1, L. T. Brink1, C. Lombard2,H . Bezuidenhout1, G. de Jong1, H. J. Odendaal1 1Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town, South Africa,2Medical Research Council of South Africa, Cape Town, South Africa Background: By Institute of Medicine criteria, smooth philtrum and thin vermilion border of the upper lip, andshort palpebral ssure length (PFL) are cardinal features of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Lip assessment is by visual comparison with a photographic 5-point Likert scale (Astleyscore), and PFL by and vermilion >4, and PFL <10thcentile de ne the facial features. We assessed gender differences in these features. Methods: The Safe Passage Study is an international cohort study of prenatal alcohol exposure effects on infant outcomes. Data from 7060 pregnancies were assessed at theCape Town site. Case report forms prospectively collected exposure information. Dysmorphologists examined one- year-olds. Multivariate statistical analysis included gender,alcohol and smoking levels per trimester, maternal mea- surements, socio-economic status, and excluded drug users. Results: After Astley score was commoner in males than females for philtrum (21.0% versus 13.3%, p < 0.001) and vermilion(20.6% versus 17.3%, p =0.005). On multivariate analysis males had relative risk Astley score >4 for philtrum of 1.53 0.53; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Gender differences in facial features for FAS diagnosis are independent of alcohol use and may confound dysmorphic assessment. Males are more likely to score positive on lip features but less likely on PFL. Cautionis warranted in reifying cut-off measurements for FAS diagnosis.

Koch1, 1Department Functional Genomics, Interfaculty Institute for Genetics Floating-Harbor syndrome (FLHS) is a rare genetic disease characterized by growth de ciency, facial dismorphism, language delays and often mild to severe intellectual disability. It is caused by mutations in theSRCAP gene, which encodes a core component of the chromatin-remodeling complex and also acts as a tran- scriptional activator. We identi ed a de novo truncating mutation in the SRCAP gene of a patient diagnosed with FLHS and aimed to establish an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line that can serve as a model for FLHS. Material and methods: Gingival broblasts from the patient and skin broblasts from the unaffected father were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a virus-free episomalvector system. iPSCs and qPCR) and differen- tiation capability (embryoid bodies). Two and three iPSCclones were generated for the patient and the control, respectively. Results: We were able to create iPSCs from primary broblasts of a FLHS patient and his father. However, the patient iPSCs displayed an atypical colony morphology with fuzzy borders and loose cell grouping. Despite theatypical appearance, the patient iPSCs were pluripotent and able to differentiate into the 3 germ-layers. Conclusions: The patient derived iPSCs we describe can be instrumental in furthering our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involving SRCAP and contribute to a better understanding of the aetiology of FLHS.

Ownership Interest Ethnicity is an independent Risk Factor for Full Mutation Expansion in FMR1 Premutation CarriersN. Domniz Genetic Institute, Tel-Aviv, Israel Design: A cohort population-based study. Materials and Methods: All Jewish FMR1 premutation carriers who underwent chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis (AC) at Sheba Medical Center and the TelAviv Medical center during the period of 2011-2018 were included in this study. Ethnicity was determined by self- report as appeared in the medical records. Long range PCRforFMR1 (Asuragen, TX, USA) was performed in order to determine the number of CGG repeats and AGG interrup- tions in all women and fetuses. General distribution anddata analysis were calculated using SPSS 18.0 and Microsoft Excel. Results: 766FMR1 premutation carriers underwent CVS or AC. Of them, 592 carriers had parents 'concordance for ethnic background. The number of CGG repeats was signicantly higher among the Ashkenazi carriers compared to Non-Ashkenazi women (median 69 vs. 64; p < 0.0001). The number of AGG interruptions was lower in Ashkenazi (35% with no AGG 's) compared to the Non-Ashkenazi carriers (20% with 0 AGG 's); p < 0.0001. Multivariate analysis using CGG repeats, AGG interrup- tions and ethnicity, revealed that women 's ethnicity was an independent risk factor for a full mutation expansion (p=0.01). Conclusions: Carrier 's ethnicity may be an independent risk factor for a full mutation expansion among FMR1 premutation carriers, suggesting the existence of further components affecting the mother-to-offspring transmissionprocess. Further research is needed in order to identify other ethnic groups at risk and to better understand the process of CGG inter-generation expansion and the different variablesthat affect it. In addition, these ndings may contribute for a precise genetic counselling. N. Domniz: None. L. Ries Levavi: None. M. Berken- stadt: None. E. Pras: None. Y. Cohen: None. H. Raanani: None. S.

Although a single individual has been reported in the literature with a homozygous possibly pathogenic variant, suggesting a recessive inheritance pattern, it is currently unclear whetherheterozygous FOXP4 variants can also cause a phenotype. Methods: We assembled a cohort of eight individuals with heterozygous and mostly de novo variants in FOXP4: seven individuals with six different missense variants and one individual with a frameshift variant. We used functional assays to assess pathogenicity of the variants, and collectedclinical data to delineate the associated phenotypic spectrum. Results: Four missense variants clustered in the DNA- forkhead-box domain of the encodedtranscription factor. Luciferase assays showed loss-of- function effects for these four missense variants, and aberrant subcellular localization was seen for three out offour. The two missense variants located outside the functional domains of FOXP4 showed transcriptional repressor capacities similar to wild-type FOXP4, as wellas normal subcellular localization patterns. Clinical data were collected for the six individuals with variants likely affecting FOXP4 functions. Recurrent features includedgrowth abnormalities, language de cits, phragmatic Although a dominant-negative effect can- not be excluded for the missense variants, it seems that loss- of-function of FOXP4 can already be suf cient to cause a phenotype. Our ndings show that heterozygous variants in FOXP4 can cause an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by growth defects, congenital abnormalities and mild developmental delays, mainly affecting speechand language.L.

Cells from rare individuals with no intellectual disability and carriers of an unmethylated full mutation (UFM) produce slightly ele-vated levels of FMR1 -mRNA and relatively low levels of FMRP, like in PM carriers. With the aim of clarifying how UFM cells differ from CTRL and FXS cells, a comparativeproteomic approach was undertaken, from which emerged an overexpression of SOD2 in UFM cells, also con rmed in PM but not in FXS. The SOD2 -mRNA bound to FMRP in UFM more than in the other cell types. The high SOD2 levels in UFM and PM cells correlated with lower levels of superoxide and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and withmorphological anomalies and depolarization of the mito- chondrial membrane detected through confocal microscopy. The same effect was observed in CTRL with FMR1 -mRNA in UFM and PM. Overall, these data suggest that in PM and UFM carriers, which have high levels of FMR1 transcrip- tion and may develop FXTAS, SOD2 overexpression helpsto maintain low levels of both superoxide and ROS with signs of mitochondrial degradation.336 J. del PicchiaV.

FRAXopathies are widespread pathologies due to CGG repeat expansion in the 5 '-UTR of the FMR1 gene. Changes in the repeat length lead to FMR1 expression alteration. Previously, microRNA involvement in FMR1 gene expression regulation was demonstrated in an animalmodel. We described nine microRNAs complementary to the 3'-UTR of FMR1 with expression alterations dependent on the FMR1 gene allele. Here, we present a study on the identi ed microRNA interactions with the 3 '-UTR of FMR1 in a plasmid model system. Materials and methods: A plasmid expressing two reporter genes was designed. Both reporters were driven by constitutive promoters. One reporter was fused with the 3 '- UTR of the FMR1 gene, while microRNA expression was driven by an inducible promoter. Measuring the protein expression of the reporter in the control and after microRNA expression induction allowed us to quantifythe interaction between the microRNA and the 3 '-UTR. Results: The model plasmid was con rmed by sequen- cing. The activity of reporter genes was detected aftertransfection of HEK293 cells. The genes of nine micro- RNAs were cloned into a plasmid and separately transfected into the cells. The expression of reporter proteins wasmeasured, and the interaction of every microRNA and the FMR1 gene was quanti ed. Conclusions: Screening of microRNA expression allowed us to study its involvement in the regulation of a specic gene. The use of a molecular model helped us to show the interaction of microRNAs and the regulatoryregion of the gene. The study is supported by Russian Science Foundation grant 18-15-00099. A.A. P08.044.B Protein abundance pro ling in murine model for intellectual disability induced by FTSJ1 de ciency L. R. Jensen 1, V. Dhople1, U. Institute for Genetics and Functional Genomics, UniversityAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 337Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany,2Proteomics Core, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar Congenital forms of intellectual disability (IQ < 50) are genetically heterogeneous but affect up to 0.5% of the population. Mutations in most known intellectual disabilitygenes often only account for a comparatively small number of cases, as exempli ed by mutations in the X-linked gene FTSJ1 , which are a rare cause for non-syndromic intellec- disability in that methylates tRNA phenylalanine at position 32 and 34 (wobble position) in yeast and man. Wehave recently established a mouse model for Ftsj1 de- ciency and found that in male Ftsj1-de cient mice the phenotype is not restricted to cognitive functions. In orderto investigate the effects of Ftsj1 de ciency in different mammalian tissues, we generated protein extracts from brain, liver, kidney and heart from ve wild type and Ftsj1 /ylittermate pairs, generated protein abundance pro- les and compared the normalized label-free quantitation values (LFQ). The fold changes between control andFtsj1 /ytissues were generally at or below factor 3, but still between 54 and 131 proteins from each tissue showed a signicantly different abundance (p < 0.01). Among these we found enrichment of proteins involved in protein synthesis, energy metabolism and actin dynamics. Our results suggest that a common pathway is affected in allfour different tissues but that the evolutionarily compara- tively young cognitive aspects of brain function are more sensitive to changes in this functional context. It also raisesthe question whether additional characteristic features might not also be detectable in patients with FTSJ1 de ciency at cellular or tissue levels. L.R. Jensen: None. V. Dhople: None.

We searched 9,858 patients for de novo variants directly upstream of genes known to cause developmental disorders and identi ed six likely disease-causing variants upstream of MEF2C . All six probands have phenotypes that are consistent with disruptions in MEF2C , including global developmental delay (6/6) and seizures (4/6), and no otherlikely diagnostic variants. These variants are predicted to cause loss-of-function through three distinct mechanisms. (1) Two 5 'UTR single nucleotide variants (SNVs) create upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that overlap with the MEF2C coding sequence out-of-frame, negatively regulating translation. (2)Two further 5 'UTR SNVs create upstream start codons that extend the coding sequence by three and nine amino acids, respectively. These variants are also observed de novo infour additional patients (two with each variant) sequenced by Genomics England and GeneDx. Protein structure modelling suggests that these variants disrupt DNA bindingof MEF2C protein, impairing its function as a transcription factor. (3) The nal two variants are large deletions (294Kb and 97Kb) that remove the N-terminal exon of the 5 'UTR and the entire promoter sequence, completely ablating transcription of one allele. We will present ongoing functional assays to prove the mechanism through whichthese variants cause disease. Our analyses show that non-coding variants upstream of known disease-causing genes are an important cause ofsevere disease and demonstrates that sequencing 5 'UTRs can increase diagnostic yield. N.

In particular, the c.1022C>Atransversion is frequently reported in European patients with GPIBD. Materials and Methods: To gain further insight into the pathophysiology of neurological features observed in patients with GPIBD, we performed a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis mouse model. Results: Based gene expression pro les of around 8,800 Pigv341Eand 7,100 wild type cells, we identi ed 17 cellular subgroups. Cells of both genotypes were present in all subgroups, but the distribution was skewed in Pigv341E mice, e.g. with an increased fraction of subicular neurons and decreased fractions of granule cells and oligodendro- cytes. The most extensive changes in transcriptional pro les due to glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor de ciency were observed in a microglia subgroup as well as in subicular neurons. Among the affected genes, several synapse-relatedGene Ontology terms were found to be enriched. Across all cellular subgroups, expression of Abl1 was decreased and expression of Hdc,Cyp4x1 , and Gm14216 increased in RNA sequencing study of hippocampus cells in the Pigv341Emouse model allowed us to generate new hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in GPIBDs. In particular, differ- ential expression of Abl1 suggests an involvement of the Eph/ephrin signaling pathway, which is known to play a major role in synapse formation and function. F.S. David: None.

Sanchez Soler1,2, L., Barcelona, Spain Introduction: X-linked mental retardation 103 is caused by loss of function mutations in KLHL15 gene. Only 2 families have been reported. First reported patient hadintellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, brain anomalies and coarse features. Array-CGH: 22kb deletion Xp22.11 involving the rst three of the four exons of KLHL15 gene; mother carried the deletion with skewed XCI in lymphocyte DNA. Second report includes a large family with several affected members with mild to moderate ID in which aprotein-truncating variant in KLHL15 which segregated with the phenotype was detected by exome sequencing. We report on a new case with a new causal variant in KLHL15which further supports its implication in ID, and delineate the phenotype. Clinical description: 5 year-old boy, second child of healthy non-consanguineous parents. Mother haddeceased twin brothers with ID and brain atrophy. Patient had global developmental delay, OFC 3 rdcentile, coarse facial features, braquidactyly, cataract and choroidal colo- boma of left eye). Brain MRI, abdominal and cardiac sonogram were normal. No epilepsy. Array-CGH wasnormal, and clinical exome sequencing detected a pre- viously not reported variant c.417_418delGA; P. Leu139ArgfsTer2 in KLHL15 gene, XCI in lymphocyte DNA (100:0). Conclusions: 1- We report on a new case of X-linked MR due to loss of function mutation in KLHL15 supportingits implication in ID. 2- This case expands clinical phenotype of patients with KLHL15 mutations with ocular involvement. 4-Achieving molecular diagnosis with NGSpermits adequate genetic counseling in families.

We present a pipeline which aims to discriminate likely diag- nostic CRE variants from those of neutral/low-penetranteffect. Six rare testable CRE variants were identi ed using targeted and whole genome sequencing in 48 unrelated males with apparent X-linked intellectual disability (XLID)but without detectable coding region variants. These variant segregated appropriately in families and altered conserved bases in CREs targeting known XLID genes. Three wereunique and three were rare but too common to be plausibly causative for XLID. Cis-regulatory activity was initially tested by comparing wild-type and mutant alleles in zeb-rash embryos using dual-color fluorescent showed striking changes: one CRE) and other likely These regulatory variants were mice and both caused abnormal embryonic neural expression of their target gene. Only micecarrying the plausible FMR1 CREshowed disease-relevant behavioral defects. We consider FMR1CREto be plausibly disease-associated and resulting in complex misregulationofFMR1 /FMRP rather than loss-of-function. This is con- sistent with absence of typical physical features of Fragile X in affected individuals and electrophysiological anomaliesin the brains of post-natal FMR1 CREmice. Thus, extreme rarity and the presence of relevant phenotypic features in knock-in mice were the only discriminative factors forcausative CRE variants. Importantly, disruption of the normal in vivo pattern of target gene expression in disease-relevant tissues cannot be used as strong evidence for Mendelian disease association. H. Bengani: None. D.

Ekici, Exome sequencing is cient test to diagnose patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Given the constantly growing number of NDD associated genes,improvements in analysis tools and information on variants, regular re-analysis of negative or unclear cases is recom- mended. In a long-term study aiming at identifying thegenetic basis of NDDs we performed exome sequencing (SureSelect_v.6; HiSeq2500) in 205 individuals from 197 families presenting with NDDs who had negative testresults including CMA. Filtering against known NDD genes (SysID database) followed by identi cation of de novo variants in all genes resulted in a diagnostic rate of 45% (89/197). Interestingly, the diagnostic yield in singletons was higher than in trios (52% vs. 42%). We now re-analysed 105 unsolved sporadic cases regarding homozygous, com-pound-heterozygous, X-linked, de novo and autosomal dominant variants in all genes, considering also an updated list of 1,164 NDD genes and 1,127 candidate genes. Oneadditional case could be diagnosed: an affected boy inher- ited a stop mutation in SETD5 from his healthy mother, which previously was missed due to ltering for de novo variants in a trio setting, highlighting the relevance of reduced penetrance. Furthermore, we identi ed 20 candi- date variants in 17 genes compatible with the clinical pre-sentation but a rm diagnosis could not be made due to lack of functional validation, including a de novo missense variant in the candidate gene NEUROD2 . The relatively low re-analysis detection rate is probably due to the high initial detection rate based on a combination of diagnostic and research analysis strategy. M. Hebebrand: None. C.T.

Pouillie, S. Vergult, M. De Smet, B. Callewaert, O. Vanakker, B. Menten, A. Dheedene Center for Medical Genetics Ghent (CMGG), Ghent, Belgium The implementation of whole exome sequencing (WES) in the clinic has led to a steep increase in diagnostic yield inpatients with (syndromic) intellectual disability (ID) and/or epilepsy. Since 2017 the Center for Medical Genetics Ghent (UZ Ghent) offers a WES-based gene panel analysis forgenes related to ID and epilepsy. Here we present an overview our ndings. WES was performed in ~1000 pro- bands and both parents (if available) using the SureSelectAll Exon kit (Agilent technologies) enrichment followed by 2x150bp sequencing on a HiSeq3000 or NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina). Data analysis was done with a com-munity developed pipeline based on the Broad Institute Best Practices (bcbio-nextgen). Virtual panel analysis was per- formed for 1175 genes and variant classi cation was based on ACMG-AMG guidelines. In 21% of cases a de nitive genetic causal defect (class 4 or 5 variant) could be iden- tied: in 60% of these patients a de novo variant was found while in 40% the causal variant was inherited. From the latter 12,5% are variants in genes related to an X-linked disorder, 41,5% to an autosomal dominant and 46% to anautosomal recessive disorder. In addition, in 25% of the patients an interesting variant of unknown signi cance (class 3) was reported. Currently, follow-up studies areongoing to evaluate these class 3 variants, e.g. collecting additional phenotypic data, performing segregation and transcriptome analysis. With a diagnostic yield between21% and 46%, we can conclude that WES is a game- changer in the diagnostic workup of patients with ID/ epilepsy. E. D 'haenens: None. E. Pouillie: None. S.

P08.056.B A de novo missense mutation highlights the role of FBXO28 gene in 1q41-q42 syndrome a distinctive neurodevelopmental syndrome. The reported clinical features include: intellectual disability, seizures, dysmorphia and brain anomalies among others. Haploinsuf ciency of different genes has been proposed as the causal mechanism. Since most of the reported 1q41-q42microdeletions encompass both FBXO28 and WDR26 genes, their causal role has been debated in recent years. Materials and Methods: Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina platform (MiSeq) considering a panel of 460 genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders. Raw reads were mapped to the human genome using BWA. PCRduplicates were removed using Picard Tools; GATK was used for base quality score recalibration and variant discovery. Variants were annotated using Annovar andltered according to their frequency in gnomAD database. Results: We identify a de novo c.1043 G>T substitution not reported in gnomAD and causing a p.Arg348Leuchange in FBXO28. The patient is affected by severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, brain alterations and absent speech, with a global phenotype resembling that of the1q41-q42 microdeletion syndrome. To date, only a single de novo loss of function mutation in FBXO28 gene has been reported for a patient having similar clinical features. Conclusions: This second case evidences the critical role of FBXO28 gene in 1q41-q42 microdeletion syndrome phenotype. FBXO28 protein is proteasomal degra- dation.

Pacio-Miguez1, CIBERER, Spain Introduction: Global developmental delay (GDD) / intel- lectual disability (ID) has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1-3%. The genetic causes of GDD/IDare highly heterogeneous, traditionally limiting the possi- bility to reach a speci c diagnosis. In recent years, with theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 341advent of next generation sequencing (NGS), the genetic diagnosis of GDD/ID has greatly improved and expanded with currently more than a 1000 genes involved. Methods: We present the results of NGS testing in a cohort of 456 individuals with syndromic GDD/ID (de ned as GDD/ID plus additional manifestations such as con-genital malformations, growth abnormalities or dysmorphic features) evaluated in our clinical genetics department over a 42-month period (Jul2016-Dec2019). All had a previousnormal 60K array-CGH (KaryoArray v3.0, Agilent). NGS trio analysis was performed either using a customized NGS panel containing 1253-1663 genes associated with neuro-developmental disorders (RD-Seq\u00a9 v1.0-v6.0) and/or exome sequencing (WES). Results: Causal variants were identi ed in 131 different genes in a total of 207 probands (45%), the majority autosomal dominant de novo variants (66%). Two novel GDD/ID causing genes have been identi ed and con rmed with further cases identi ed through international collabora- tion. Detailed results of the cohort will be presented. Conclusions: This study re flects the vast genetic hetero- geneity associated to GDD/ID. Comprehensive clinical and molecular evaluation are key to a successful etiological diagnosis, increasing our genomic understanding of GDD/ID and ultimately allowing improved medical management and genetic counselling for these patients and their families.

These individuals belong to the same family fromNortheastern Brazil, which has 28 consanguineous mar- riages and 59 genotyped family members. IMPA1 is responsible for the generation of free inositol from de novo biosynthesis and recycling from inositol polyphosphates and participates in the phosphatidylinositol signaling path- way. To understand the role of IMPA1 de ciency in ID, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients and neurotypical controls and differentiated these substantial de cits in proliferation and neurogenic potential. At low passage NPCs (P1 to P3), we observed cell cyclearrest, apoptosis, progressive change to a glial morphology and reduction in neuronal differentiation. These observa- tions were validated by transcriptome pro ling. Tran- scriptome analysis showed that NPCs and neurons derived from ID patients have extensive deregulation of gene expression affecting pathways necessary for neurogenesisand upregulation of gliogenic genes. IMPA1 de ciency did not affect cell cycle progression or survival in iPSCs and glial progenitor cells or astrocyte differentiation. Therefore,this study shows that the IMPA1 mutation speci cally affects NPC survival and neuronal differentiation. This study nancially supported by G. Kobayashi: None. D. Moreira: None. D.

JS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by malformation of the and brainstem, hypotonia, additional del PicchiaClinical report: We report on a 3-year-old girl born of consanguineous parents with signi cant psychomotor delay, expressive language disorder, muscular hypotonia, gait ataxia and increased re flexes in the lower extremities. Cranial MRI at age 8 and 33 months did not show any structural abnormality apart from a pineal cyst and lipomaof the lum terminale in spinal MRI. A detailed examina- tion revealed bitemporal a strabismus, long, curlyeyelashes, a high-arched palate, a low-set hairline. Methods and Results: Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) showed a homozygous deletion of 88.97 kb at 2q13 (110879075-110968043) encompassing the entire NPHP1 gene. Both parents carry the deletion in heterozygous form. Conclusions: Homozygous NPHP1 deletion (JBTS4, OMIM #609583) in a subset of mildly affected patients. Reportswithout the pathognomic molar tooth sign are very rare, though, subtle ndings that may be missed have been reported. In our patient many features may evolve onlylater; there is a high risk for nephronophthisis and ophthalmologic abnormalities.

P08.061.A When a seemingly heterozygous CNV turns out to be compound-heterozygous - from NRXN1- associated neu- rodevelopmental disorder to Pitt-Hopkins-like 2 Platzer1, N. Rahner3 1Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany,2Heinrich-Heine-University, Medical Faculty, Institute of Human Genetics, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany,3Institute of Clinical Genetics, Bonn, Germany Introduction: Heterozygous CNVs and SNVs of NRXN1 have been associated with a wide spectrum of neurodeve-lopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including mild to moderate intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum dis- orders (ASD) and schizophrenia with reduced penetrance.Furthermore homozygous and compound-heterozygous variants of NRXN1 are autosomal recessive Pitt-Hopkins-like syndrome 2, including severeID and a spectrum of ASD, epilepsy and breathing anomalies.Materials and Methods: We report on an 11-year old female presenting with moderate ID, no active speech development, muscular hypotonia, one febrile seizure during childhood and suspected autism. Family history includes the father with learning dif culties and a paternal aunt and cousin with learning dif culties, epilepsy and autism. Results: SNP-Array revealed a deletion 8-19 of NRXN1 . As the phenotype of our patient was more severe than would be expected, we additionally performed NGS-panel-diagnos- tics, which revealed unremarkable ndings in the index individual. Segregation analysis in the parents unexpectedly revealed a heterozygous deletion of exons 10-19 in the father and a heterozygous deletion of exons 8-9 in themother. The mother is unaffected. Conclusions: The initial diagnosis of NRXN1 -associated developmental delay due to a seemingly heterozygousdeletion turned into a Pitt-Hopkins-like syndrome 2 caused by a compound-heterozygous deletion in NRXN1 . Further genetic testing including segregation analysis are thereforekey for patients not phenotypically matching the initial diagnosis, especially in genes where multiple modes of inheritance are known.

P08.062.B Comprehensive genetic analysis of intellectual disability patients from the Kashubian population using homo- zygosity mapping and Hoffman-Zacharska1 1Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland,2Medical University of Gda sk, Gda sk, Poland,3Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID) is the most common form of intellectual disability (ID) in populations with frequent parental consanguinity.However, ARID is extremely heterogeneous, and the vast majority of ARID genes are still unknown. The main research hypothesis of the study was the assumption thatpatients with ID belonging to the isolated Kashubian population have, because of parental consanguinity, homozygous regions in the genome where pathogenic,recessive mutations are present.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 343Materials and Methods: The project included 45 families of Kashubian origin. There were 64 patients diagnosed with ID in this group. To identify regions where pathogenic, homozygous mutations may be present, an innovative, computational method combining homozygos- ity mapping and exome sequencing was used. In thismethod homozygous regions were indicated by coverage analysis involving biallele frequency calculation, transfor- mation and segmentation. Results: No evident homozygous regions were identi ed in patients of Kashubian origin. Mutations responsible for ARID were rare. It has been shown that the molecular basisof ID in this group is not ARID, but autosomal dominant ID and X-linked ID. Overall, clearly pathogenic variants have been identi ed in 29% of examined families. Conclusions: This project was the rst in Poland, and one of the rst in Europe aiming to identify recessive risk factors involved in the pathogenesis of ID based ongenomic data obtained by testing an isolated European population. The molecular basis of ID in the group of Kashubian patients proved to be not autosomal recessive,but autosomal X-linked None. T. None. J. E. Kaczorowska: None. E. Obersztyn: None. B. Wojta :None. B.

P08.063.C Identi cation the role of TUB in Intellectual Disability using RNA-seq F. Peymani 1, K. InanlooRahtloo2 1Genetic Research Center, University of social welfare and Rehabilitation, Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of, 2School of Biology, University College of Science, Uni- versity of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of Intellectual disability (ID) is a genetically and phenotypi- cally heterogeneous disorder with more than 1000 candidate genes to date. Despite the accelerating rate of gene dis- covery for ID, the molecular mechanisms underlying thedisease remain elusive. In a previous study, whole exome sequencing in a consanguineous family with ve affected individuals representing ID led to the identi cation of a splice site variant (NM_003320:c.1281 +1G>A) in TUB, a novel ID candidate gene, whose mutations have already been associated with Retinal dystrophy and obesity. TUBacts both as a membrane bound transcription regulator and an adaptor molecule in insulin signaling and GPCRtrafcking in neuronal cilia. In order to investigate TUB role in the etiology of ID and identify dysregulated mole- cular pathways in patients, we conducted whole blood transcriptome pro ling of patients and their age and sex matched healthy individuals, using RNA-seq technique. The transcription pro le demonstrates deregulation of 1045 genes ( p-value < 0.01, fold change > 1.5), of these 155 genes were upregulated and 890 genes were downregulated. Upregulated genes show enrichment in Insulin synthesisand processing, diabetes and metabolism pathways and the molecular function of downregulated genes mainly include constituent of ribosome, transcription regulator and DNAbinding. Signaling pathways involved in the regulation of translation and insulin synthesis and processing were amongst the most signi cant dysregulated pathways in patients. Here, we put an emphasis on the role of insulin and translation pathways in the molecular pathophysiology of ID. This study was funded by National Institute For Med-ical Research Development (NIMAD).

Materials and Methods: We report 15 year-old patient who was born at term with healthy conditions. Motor signals were delayed, and also seizures started at the age of 18 months. EEG revealed generalized spike-wave activities.Brain MRI performed, atrophy of the cerebellum was detected. Recent clinical examination;contractures on the large joints, and dyskinetic tremor. Whole exome sequen-cing (WES) was performed and in-slico analyses were conducted. MCF7 and 293T cells transfected with either344 J. del Picchiawild-type or mutant expression vectors. Cellular distribution was determined by immuno fluorescence.

Immuno fluorescent staining revealed that novel variant is not interfering with synthesis of KCNMA1however mutation exhibit dominant-negative effect on cell viability when compared to wild-type. 293T and MCF7 cells transfected with homozygous p.Arg458Ter mutationshowed markedly increased KCNMA1 currents compared to controls on patch clamp recording, and these data support loss-of-function effect of all KCNMA1 mutants. Conclusions: Herein we report a 15-year old boy who has neurological conditions. A novel homozygous stop-gain mutation detected by WES and con rmed by conventional sequencing. Afterwards, functional characterization was conducted using two step-approach, immunostaining to detect subcellular effect of the variation and patch-clamp todetect difference between mutant vs. wild-type of the protein.

P08.065.B A next generation sequencing solution to detect copy number variants, single nucleotide variants and loss of heterozygosity in intellectual disability and developmen- tal delay samples J. Reid, S. Kachhia, P. Dougall , J. Shovelton, Marek, V. Pullabhatla, L.Parkes, D. Hurd Oxford Gene Technology, Oxford, United KingdomThe detection of copy number variants (CNVs) in intel- lectual disability (ID) and developmental delay (DD) sam-ples is crucial in elucidating the genetic cause of abnormality. We have developed a targeted NGS panel and analytical software to accurately detect CNVs, as well asSNVs, indels and LOH. The assay uses a bait capture approach, which is able to capture the exons and untranslated regions (UTRs) fromover 700 genes, chosen for their relevance in ID/DD, as well as a range of backbone regions across the genome.Combined with the CNV detection algorithm in the software, both intragenic and large 'backbone 'CNVs can be con dently detected. We implemented a web-based data analysis solution that runs OGT 's NGS analysis pipeline, comprising many state- of-the-art open-source NGS software tools. These toolswere carefully chosen and deployed using containers to ensure cross-platform compatibility and reproducibility. Pipeline optimisation and performance was assessed usingequivalent array data and reference materials. We will outline the results from over 200 intellectual disability and developmental research samples to demon-strate the ef ciency of the CNV, SNV and LOH detection. The study demonstrated that the assay automatically called 97% of CNVs assay was able to call CNV deletions as small as 1.42 kb and CNVs in samples with mosaicism as low as 10%. We have describedan improved method to investigate ID/DD, providing critical information on not just CNVs, but SNVs and Indels as well. J. Reid: A.

P08.066.C Clinical and genetic aspects in 26 patients with KBG syndrome caused by mutation of ANKRD11 . M. Rio1, Rondeau1, Hospital, Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Paris, France,2Data plateform, IMAGINE Institut, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9,, Paris, France Normal 0 21 false 1975, is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distinctive facial features, developmental delay, short stature, and skeletal anomalies. In 2011, heterozygous mutations in theANKRD11 gene were identi ed in patients with KBG syndrome. Since then, 200 cases have been described expanding the clinical phenotype. Here we present 26unrelated patients with pathogenic mutations in ANKRD11. We compare these patients with previously reported cases to further expand and update the phenotypic and mutationalspectrum of this condition. The mutation occurred de novo in the 22 families where parental DNA was available and was inherited from a parent in two patients. Age at diag-nosis ranged from 7 to 58 years. Developmental delay was reported in 94% of the patients. Intellectual disability was not a constant nding. Three patients attended regular school. 68% of patients have behavioral disorders, and 30% of patients have methylphenidate therapy for attention decit hyperactivity disorder. Gastrointestinal ndings were common. 56% of patients had deafness. This study allowed us to con rm clinical features already reported in the lit- erature (deafness, feeding of the olfactory bulbs, a sign not described in the literature to our knowledge, was identi ed in 3 patients.

Schaefer 1, Mary2, de diag- nosis in individuals with intellectual de ciency (ID) and, through its unbiased approach, to broaden the clinical spectra associated with each gene involved. We reportherein 6 patients with isolated intellectual disability (ID), carriers of a likely pathogenic variant in KCNQ2 , a gene usually implicated in benign familial neonatal seizures(BFNS) or early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE). Patients were diagnosed either by targeted HTS (panel of 450-556 epilepsy- and/or ID-related genes) or exomesequencing. Pathogenicity of the variants and predictions of proteic structural changes were assessed by multiple in silico tools. All patients were children at diagnosis. Patients ' ID ranged from mild to severe with predominance of speech disturbance and autistic features. All patients carried a heterozygous likely pathogenic missense variant in KCNQ2 , 4 of them disrupted the same amino-acid (Arg144, pre- viously reported in EOEE). We compiled all the pathogenic variants previously reported (>130). We observed thatmissense variants in the voltage-sensing domain and the pore are signi cantly more associated to EOEE than BFNS (p < 0.01, Fisher test). However, there was a strong overlapbetween variants causing EOEE, isolated ID and BFNS and phenotypic variability. To con- clude, pathogenic variants in KCNQ2 can be associated with isolated ID. We did not highlight strong correlations between KCNQ2 -related phenotypes and the associated variants 'localization. A second genetic hit, a burden of rare variants or other extrinsic factors may explain such a phe- notypic variability. However, it is of interest to study encephalopathy genes in non-epileptic ID patients. E. Schaefer: None. L. Mary: None. E. Nourrisson: None. C. Feger: None. B. Isidor: None. G. Lesca: None. D.

P08.068.B Brain-on-a-chip: altered neuronal network development in neural derived patients with intellectualdisability N. Nadif Kasri , M. Bokhoven Radboudumc, Nijmegen, NetherlandsGreat progress has been made over recent years towards the identi cation of intellectual disability (ID)-related genes, resulting in hundreds of genes. A remaining challenge, however, is to connect the genetic causes of ID to processes that establish and/or modify neuronal circuit function. Therecent developments in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have provided us with the ability to model patient- specic neuronal networks. We studied the development of neuronal networks of iNeurons derived from patients with Kleefstra Syndrome, Koolen-de Vries Syndrome, and Kabuki Syndrome. These are three well-described intellec-tual disability syndromes caused by mutations in different ers, respectively in EHMT1 ,KANSL1 and KMT2D . Little is known as to how disruption in these genes lead to altered neuronal network development. Here, we monitored the electrophysiological activity of neuronal networks coupled to multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) overtime and compared their activity to healthy controls and between syndromes. Interestingly, independent clustering analysis revealed that all tested patient lines deviated fromhealthy control lines, which functionally clustered together. Whereas Koolen-de Vries patient lines showed a general reduced level of activity, Kleefstra syndrome and Kabukisyndrome patient lines were mainly characterized by changes in neuronal network burst activity and organisation. Interestingly, patient lines from the same syndrome phe-notypically clustered together, but separately between syn- dromes. These data indicate that neuronal network measurement of iNeurons on MEAs is a robust and sensi-tive method to perform genotype-phenotype analyses for NDDs and can be a powerful platform for drug screening assays N.

P08.069.C Novel missense mutation of the KMT2D gene a is a rare congenital disorder characterized by typical facial features, postnatal growth de ciency, intellectual disability, skeletal anomalies and cardiac defects with variable expressivity. Mutations intheKMT2D gene (lysine-speci demethylase 6A) have been identi ed as the main cause of KS. Both genes are involved in cellular differentiation processes during embryonic development. Here, we report a 4 10/12-year old girl with the clinical diagnosis of KS due to typical facialdysmorphism, slightly reduced head circumference and speech delay. Materials and Methods: We performed multi-gene panel testing via sequencing by synthesis, which includes among others the two core genes KMT2D andKDM6A associated with KS. Results: We revealed a novel missense variation c.15869G>A / p.(Gly5290Asp) in exon 49 of the KMT2D gene in the index patient. This mutation occurred de novo,since it was absent in the clinically unaffected parents. Conclusions: The majority of mutations (about 87 %) causing KS produce premature termination codons. How-ever, the role of missense mutations remains weakly explored, although they may be disease-relevant dependings on the localization in the gene. The detected missensevariant is situated in the functional \"FY-rich\" domain C- terminal (FYRC) of the protein, suggesting that it may affect function. It has previously not been annotated inGnomAD or Ensembl and is classi ed as \"probably damaging \"by several prediction data bases like PolyPhen-2. There is also a strong evidence for thedisease-causing effect due to de novo occurrence and the patient\u00b4s phenotype. S. Riedel: None. M.

This previous study included 38 patients with het- erozygous, mostly truncating de novo variants in KMT2E or microdeletions disrupting the gene. We present the second case series of patients with ODLURO, re ning the muta- tional and phenotypic spectrum of this not-so-raresyndrome. Results: We report 13 additional patients with ODLURO from clinical centers in Europe and the US. We detected tenheterozygous nonsense or frameshifting variants, two with predicted deleterious effects on splicing, and one micro- deletion encompassing >90% of KMT2E 's coding sequence (eleven changes con rmed de novo). Eleven variants and the microdeletion are novel, one has been previously observed 1. We con rm and re ne the phenotypic spectrum of the KMT2E -related neurodevelopmental disorder, espe- cially concerning developmental delay with rather mildintellectual disability and macrocephaly with subtle facial features in most patients. In contrast to the study of O'Donnell-Luria et al.21, the rate of autism in our cohort was higher with ~40%, whereas seizures were reported in only a single patient with recurring febrile seizures. Furthermore, we describe additional anomalies and symp-toms reported only in one or two patients, for which a potential causal relation to the disruption of KMT2E remains to be investigated. Our study, bringing the totalof known patients to more than 50 within a year of the rst publication, also illustrates a surprisingly high relative frequency of ODLURO worldwide.

Epilepsy, autism and macrocephaly are part of the phenotype in a subset ofthe affected individuals. The occurrence of truncating variants in most of these subjects and the overlapping features observed in cases withmicrodeletions spanning this gene suggest haploinsuf - ciency as the mechanism underlying this type of variants. Clinical description and molecular ndings: A male was referred for genetic evaluation at the age of 2 months in the context of prenatal-onset hydronephrosis, DD and dysmorphic features. Investigation with chromosomalmicroarray (CMA) revealed a 239-kb microdeletion of 7q22-q23 spanning 2 protein coding genes, namely KMT2E348 J. del Picchiaand LHFPL3 . The deletion was classi ed as VUS at the time of initial reporting. Re-evaluation of the CMA result upon last examination of the child at the age of 3 years and 3 months, resulted in re- classi cation of the variant to likely pathogenic. Similarly to other individuals harboring variants affecting KMT2E , our proband presented DD, dysmorphic features albeit without occurrence of autistic features, epilepsy or abnormal growth parameters. Review of his medical records revealedpersistence of hydronephrosis without associated anomalies of the urogenital tract. The boy had extensive work-up for severe constipation, raising suspicion of possible Hirsch-sprung disease. Conclusions: We provide a detailed clinical description of our proband, focusing on ill-de ned previously reported issues such as bowel dysmotility while extending the phenotypic spectrum of the disorder with additional features such as hydronephrosis.

P08.072.C MEA-seq for combined gene expression and neuronal network measurements in iPSC-derived neurons fromKoolen-de Vries patients A. H. A. Verboven , K. Linda, M. Hogeweg, C. A. Albers, B. B. A. de Vries, P. A. C. 't Hoen, N. Nadif Kasri Radboudumc, Nijmegen, NetherlandsKoolen-de Vries Syndrome syndrome caused by haploinsuf ciency of KANSL1 , due to a loss-of-function mutation in KANSL1 or a micro- deletion in region 17q21.31. To study KdVS in vitro, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) frombroblasts of three KdVs patients and three healthy con- trols. Additionally, we introduced a loss-of-function muta- tion in KANSL1 in one control line using the CRISPR/ Cas9 system. For all cell lines, iPSCs were differentiated into neurons (iNeurons) by forced expression of neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) resulting in a homogeneous popula-tion of mature excitatory neurons within 30 days. MEA-seq was performed to measure neuronal activity of iNeurons arrays (MEAs), followed by RNAsequencing (RNA-seq). The RNA-seq method used allows us to screen many samples at low cost by barcoding and pooling samples during the library preparation. MEAmeasurements revealed a decreased network burst rate and more irregular ring pattern in KdVS iNeurons. RNA-seq was performed on these iNeurons as well as on iPSCs fromthe same individuals. Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed to identify changes in gene expression inKdVS patients compared to controls. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed cell type-speci c enrichment of up- and down-regulated genes in gene sets involved in processes such as cell cycle regulation, cellular respiration and early development. These results show that MEA-seq allows for characterization of iPSC-derived neurons both ona functional and transcriptional level, and therefore is a powerful tool to study mechanisms underlying neurodeve- lopmental disorders.

Variable clinical features include seizures, behavioral problems, craniosynostosis, brain MRI changes and endocrine abnormalities. In summary, homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in KPTN may be a hitherto under- recognized cause of macrocephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability and language de cit. We suggest including KPTN in gene panels for the study of patients with these features. M. Pacio Miguez: None. F. Santos Simarro: None. S. Garc\u00eda-Mi\u00f1a\u00far: None.

P08.074.B The simultaneous presence of microcephaly, seizures, and developmental delay due to PNKP gene mutation and infantile hypophosphatasia caused by mutation inALPL gene I. Sansovic , A. Bobinec, A. Measic, M. Kero, I. Barisic Department of Medical Genetics and Reproductive Health, Children 's Hospital Zagreb, Scienti c Centre of Excellence for Reproductive and Regenerative Medicine (CERRM), University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croa- tia Introduction: Microcephaly, seizures, and developmental delay (MCSZ; MIM #613402) is neurodevelopmental dis-order with onset in infancy caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the PNKP gene. There is a range of phenotypic severity: some patients haveearly infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), whereas others have more well-controlled seizures and a protracted course. Infantile hypophosphatasia (MIM #241500) iscaused by a pathogenic mutation in the ALPL gene char- acterized by defective bone mineralization, a combination of typical radiological signs, hypercalcemia, hyperpho-sphatemia, and low alkaline phosphatase activity. We describe a family with three affected children born of allegedly nonconsanguineous with infantilehypophosphatasia and nine-year-old sister with infantile hypophosphatasia, microcephaly, global developmental delay and paroxysmal seizures with vomiting. Method: Clinical exome sequencing was performed in all family members using Illumina TruSight One Kit.Results: A boy with MCSZ has a homozygous c.1253_1269dup17 pathogenic variant in the PNKP gene, the older sister has homozygous c.542C>T pathogenic variant in ALPL gene and the younger sister has homozygous pathogenic variants in both genes. Conclusions: The simultaneous presence of infantile hypophosphatasia and MCSZ has never been reported before. The overlapping clinical features of infantile hypophosphatasia and MCSZ (hypotonia, craniosynostosis,seizures, short stature, failure to thrive) as well as the milder clinical course of MCSZ, resulted in delayed diagnosis of MCSZ in the female patient.

To further delineate its spectrum, we have studied 28 clinically well-characterized newpatients (age 7 months to 31 years) harbouring pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) MED13L sequence or copy number variants. We found 21 likely gene-disrupting(LGD) de novo variants distributed throughout the gene and 7 deleterious missense variants (5 de novo, 2 unknown inheritance). We observed clustering of our new and pre-viously reported P/LP missense variants between the two LxxLL motifs, between Leu-Zipper and Ser-rich motifs, and within the C-terminus of the MED13L protein, which aredeprived of missense variants in gnomAD. Clinically, we have been able to ascertain details of developmental mile- stones and growth parameters, and to nd multiple novel features. Remarkably, we noticed previously unreported mild global developmental delay in 3/28 (~11%) and verbal dyspraxia in 6/28 (~21%) patients harbouring of epi- lepsy (~86% vs. ~29%) and severe congenital heart defects requiring surgery (~29% vs. 0%) in our patients with mis-sense compared to LGD variants. We also report the rst MED13L patient with no obvious congenital heart defect who passed away at the age of ~10 years possibly due torespiratory insuf ciency and right-heart failure. Altogether, ourndings highlight new aspects of the syndrome and suggest a critical role for the MED13L C-terminus, mis-sense defects of which may even cause a more severe phenotype than MED13L haploinsuf ciency.

Perovic1, M. Grk1,M Human Genetics, Belgrade, Serbia,2Clinic of Neurology and Psychiatry for Children and Youth, Belgrade, Serbia Introduction: Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is the most important cause of cerebral palsy (CP). Perinatalbrain damage activates the immune system and in flamma- mediators. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are necessary in in flammation and might be involved in neu- rodegeneration. Aim of this study was to examine possible association between MMP2 promoter polymorphisms and CP onset in children with perinatal asphyxia. Material and methods: Study included 96 patients aged 1 to 16 years with anamnesis of perinatal asphyxia. Detailed neurological evaluation and neuroimaging (ultrasound,computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) were performed for all subjects. TaqMan assays were used Frequencies of rs243866 and rs243864 AG, 2.8% GG and 2.7% AT, while in the group of those who did not develop CP were in patients with CP (p =0.018). Also, in patients with AG haplotype, HIE and pathological neuroimagingnding were more frequently observed (p =0.012, p =0.048, respectively) Conclusions: MMP2 promoter haplotype could be a risk for CP in patients with perinatal asphyxia.

The precise functions of SETBP1 , encoding the SET-binding protein 1, are yet to be dis-covered. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms or neuronal pathways by which rare loss-of function SETBP1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder remain largelyunknown. Materials and Methods: By employing induced plur- ipotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain organoids andtranscriptomic approaches, we aim to dissect the underlying neuronal pathways. We will differentiate patient-derived iPSCs carrying de mutations organoids. transcriptomic will levels. Morphological examination, clustering, cell-type speci c differential gene expression analysis and cell lineage tracing will be performed. Results: We have identi ed six truncating mutations in theSETBP1 gene in a Dutch cohort. We have generated homozygous and heterozygous SETBP1 knockout iPSC lines using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing. Moreover, we have characterized a robust protocol for generating cerebral organoids using the isogenic control iPSC line that we usedto generate SETBP1 knockout iPSCs. Conclusions: These iPSC lines are ready for cerebral organoid differentiation and subsequent downstream ana-lyses. In the long-term, we hope that cell-culture models can provide a platform for testing drug panels with the potential to rescue aberrant molecular/cellular phenotypes that weobserve. Together, this work promises to offer insights into fundamental neuronal mechanisms that go awry in SETBP1 disorder and, ultimately, to accelerate development oftherapeutic applications. M.M.K.

Popp Institute of Human Genetics, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany Clinical guidelines recommend iterative re-analysis in undiagnosed cases. Re-interpretation and reporting research in light of novel data is not well investigated. Of 152 consanguineous families with NDDs we previously found adiagnosis in 56 and identi ed VUS or candidate genes in 53. In total 116 variants were reported in 109 families. We re-evaluated all reported variants according to updatedclassi cation guidelines or our internal candidate gene scoring system. Variants in candidate genes were uploaded to GeneMatcher and collaborations were joined/initiated.We re-processed all case-level re-analysis. In variants variantclassi cation or increased signi cance of candidate genes. In 4 (9%) of the 43 undiagnosed cases a possible diagnosis was found. Of the 53 originally identi ed candidate genes 8 were in the meantime associated with NDDs, 2 are in submission and 3 collaborations were entered in the course of this project. Two reported variants were missed by theupdated computational pipeline due to alignment (old data) or reference (ambiguous region in hg38) issues. We sub- mitted all relevant variants to public databases and revisedtheir previous classi cation. Our results support the need to re-evaluate research screening studies. We highlight potential bene ts and pitfalls of computational re-analysis. Its complexity for old data should be weighed against the decreasing re-testing costs. Published variants in established and candidate disease genes are not assessable unlessreported in databanks. Future studies should incorporate post-publication variant management and bio-banking of patient cells for upcoming methods. T. Bartolomaeus: None. R.

We now assembled clinical and mutational information on 13 additional cases. The phenotypic spectrum remainshighly variable, and the mutational spectrum includes intragenic deletions, likely gene disrupting and missense variants distributed across the protein, in line with hap-loinsuf ency of FBXO11 as the most likely disease mechanism. We analyzed the effects of ten different missense variants on protein expression and localization by overexpression of mutant constructs in HEK293 and Hela cells. Variants located close to the N-terminal F-Box domain lead toaltered subcellular localization and exclusion from the nucleus, and to reduced protein levels in western blot. In contrast, variants localized in the C-terminal Zn- nger UBR domain lead to an accumulation in cytoplasmatic granules and to increased protein levels in the cell. Together, these results indicate that some missense variants impair functionthrough mislocalization or reduced expression. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism, we investigated the effects of Fbxo11 deciency on neuronal development. We found a mild impairment of basic locomotor function in the climbing assay upon neuronal knockdown and a stronger impairment upon glial knock-down. We also found decreased dendrite branching and total dendrite length upon Fbxo11 knockdown in multiple dendrite neurons of the larval body wall. Our study further characterizes the FBXO11 associated NDD and the underlying pathomechanism and highlights the importance of Drosophila Fbxo11 for neuronal devel- opment and basic None. T.

P08.083.B Using RNA-sequencing to expand the diagnostic toolset for neurodevelopmental disorders: a pilot study M. Radtke , D. Le Duc, R. Jamra Medical University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany Introduction: Despite the inclusion of next generation sequencing in routine genetic diagnostics, around 50 % of cases remain unsolved. One cause for this is the dif culty of assessing synonymous and non-coding SNVs. RNA- sequencing is one way to unravel their potential causality and gain rst insights in potential pathomechanisms. Materials and Methods: We extracted RNA from PAX- blood of a rst cohort of 26 individuals with syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders that remained unsolved afterexome sequencing. The RNA-sequencing data was ana- lyzed with respect to gene expression and splicing alterations. Results: Arst evaluation of the sequencing data shows a strong inter-individual fluctuation, stressing the importance of selecting appropriate control groups. Differentiallyexpressed genes were then analyzed with regard to function, interaction and disease association. In at least two individuals, we identi ed disruptive splicing events in genes with a known disease association. In one individual we found a signi cant enrichment in differentially expressed genes involved in synaptic signaling andneuronal processes. This implies a possible disturbance of neuronal pathways and offers a set of potential candidate genes for further investigations. We are still in the processof interrogating the sequencing data and will present a full report of our ndings at the conference. Conclusions: The blending of exome and transcriptomic sequencing data allows for more in depth exploration and offers the potential to identify disruptive variants which remain unnoticed by exome sequencing.

The etiology of NDDs include both environmental and genetic causes. In this study we evaluated the genotype-phenotype correlation of 201 patients with NDDs con- secutively admitted to our Unit for a clinical genetic eva- luation from 2006 to 2019. Based on the clinical evaluation,the appropriate genetic testing was performed for each patient: array-CGH and FMR1 analysis were used as rst- tier tests and speci c genetic testing/WES as second-tier analysis. Array-CGH was performed in 158 cases and positive in 13 (DR 8.2%). Two patients were carriers of a complex chromosomal rearrangements (one due to chro-mothripsis), a family had a recurrent 4p15.31p15.2 deletion. Speci c genetic tests revealed a pathogenic variant in 7.5%. WES was performed in 52 patients and revealed a mutationinHNRNPH2, DLG4, IQSEC2, ATP1A3 genes (DR 16%). Overall, 16 different genetic conditions were diagnosed and Fragile-X syndrome was the most frequent (3 cases).Detection rate of array-CGH in our cohort was roughly in line with the 10% estimated by in literature. In our cohort, the results of WES are encouraging but certainly under-estimated: DR of this test would be higher if WES was employed also instead of other second-tier speci c gene analysis (DR estimated: 23%). The new knowledge andtechnologies would probably change the multi-step genetic testing approach, indicating WES or WGS as rst step analysis after FMR1 test as routine diagnostic test in all patients with NDDs.354 J. del PicchiaA.

However, with the introduction of the NGS, the setting of the genotype-phenotype correlations has become even more straightfor- ward. By determining causative mutations in individual genes, it enabled us to understand the role of individualgenes in the etiology of the disease, and signi cantly increased the diagnostic yield for genetic diagnostic of NDDs in Slovenian children. Methods: Clinical exome sequencing was performed by using the TruSight One Illumina Kit (4813 genes) and focusing on phenotype driven analysis on a small serie (N45) of pediatric patients with various NDDs. Results: With NGS analysis, we were able to identify the genetic origin of the disorder (pathogenic Single NucleotideVariant - pSNV) in 29% of screened patients. In 24% of patients, a SNV classi ed as variant of unknown signi - cance (VOUS) has been determined within the disease-associated genes. Discussion: With phenotype-genotype driven analysis, we were able to identify rare and clinically poorly de ned syndromes in previously undiagnosed patients. Among them, disorders such as Kabuki and Noonan syndrome, Menkes disease, mutations in IQSEC2 gene causing theRett-like phenotype etc. were identi ed. A high percent of pSNV are also partly due to the selection of suitable patients for NGS testing based on their good clinical characteriza-tion. Our study con rmed a high ef ciency of NGS in diagnostic of NDDs and enabled the diagnosis of rarely described cases which will be presented. D. Krgovic: None. S.

Recently, patients harbouring heterozygous truncating NSD2 variants. In order to understand the full clinical spectrum and molecular mechanism, we investigated 15 new indivi-duals carrying truncating or phenotypic collected for 15 new sporadic and familial affectedindividuals. Clinical data were compared to the available information of 10 previously described carriers of NSD2 truncating variants or small deletions. modelled in silico . Each missense variant was tested in vitro for methyltransferase activity and for the ability to reconstitute H3K36me2 in knockoutcell lines. Results: the core phenotype associated NSD2 pathogenic variants overlaps only partially with WHS andincludes mild to moderate DD, prenatal-onset growth retardation, failure to thrive and characteristic facial features distinct from WHS. Carriers of missense variants weresignicantly taller and had more frequent behavioural/ psychological issues compared to carriers of truncating variants. BMI was signi cantly higher in older patients. All missense variants in known structures are supposed to interfere with NSD2 's folding and function in silico .In vitroAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 355data showed that missense variants lead to a reduction of methylation activity.

Ownership Interest (stock, stock options, patent or other intellectual property); Signi syndrome (PS) (OMIM #602342) is a rare disorder characterized by intellectual impairment, characteristicfacial gestalt, microcephaly, fetal nger/toes pads and anteromedial fat pads of the heels (Pierpont et al, 1998). A recurrent de novo TBL1XR1 variant [c.1337A>G; p. (Tyr446Cys)] is known to be disease-causing for the syn- drome (Heinen et al, > A;p.(Cys325Tyr) and c.1336 T > C;p.(Tyr446His)] have been reported in patients with a typical PS (Lemattre et al, 2018). The authors suggest compar- ability between the functional consequences of all thesevariants. TBL1XR1 haploinsuf ciency, though, is reported to cause a different entity, MRD41 (OMIM# 616944). Here we report on a four-year-old girl with a typical PS pheno-type and a novel de novo heterozygous TBL1XR1 variant, c.1184A>G;p.(Tyr395Cys). We studied the three- dimensional structure of TBLR1 protein and noted thatthe amino acid affected by this variant is located in the WD6 repeat of the WD40 domain and lies in the close vicinity of the amino acids affected by the other PS causingvariants (Tyr446 and Cys325). The WD40 domain has a -propeller-like-structure where hotspot residues at the domain 's top as identi ed by WDSPdb (Wang et al, 2015) are likely to interact with -catenin. Tyr395 and Tyr446 are hotspot residues and therefore predicted to be of importancefor the function. In summary, a review of the clinical and molecular data of all the reported patients so far, inclusive the present patient, suggests that the TBL1XR1 variants causing PS affect most likely protein structures with com- parable gene function.

The Glu198Lys mutations, located in the PP2A catalytic subunit interaction interface, is associated with a more severe phenotype due to its severeeffects on the binding properties of the B regulatory subunit PP2A. All but one the mutations were detected by targeted NGS analysis of a ID/ASD multigenic panel in 600 NDDssubjects. Among these cases we report for the rst time a dual diagnosis. A girl carrying a de novo Glu198Lys mutation, identi ed by whole-exome sequencing, exhibiting a very severe NDD with ID, ASD, absent speech, marked hypotonia, and typical dysmorphisms, also carry a full FMR1 gene mutation. The fragile X phenotype seemed tobe overshadowed by the severe PPP2R5D clinical features. The other individuals carrying PPP2R5D mutations (seg- regation analysis is currently underway) showed a rathermild ID phenotype, very variable dysmorphic features, no hypotonia and, only in case of the Glu200Lys mutation,356 J. del Picchiaabsence of ASD features. These new cases con rm the phenotype correlations in recurring mutations and con- tribute to highlighting the variability of PPP-related NDDs. M. Aspromonte: None. E. Leonardi: None. R. Polli: None.

P08.093.C A novel mutation in WDR62 gene in a patient who had autosomal recessive primary microcephaly with con- comitant .A 1Department of Pediatric Genetics, Dr. Behcet Uz Chil- dren 's Hospital, Izmir, Turkey,2Department of Medical Genetics, Dr. Behcet Uz Children 's Izmir, Turkey, 3Department of Pediatric Turkey Introduction: Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly is a rare form of primary microcephaly, characterized by a marked reduction in brain size and intellectual disability.WDR62 , which is the second most frequently mutated gene, plays a signi cant role in neuronal progenitor cell pro- liferation and spindle formation. Materials and Methods: Herein, we present a novel WDR62 gene mutation in a 11 year-old girl. The index girl patient was referred to our genetic clinic for microcephaly,epilepsy and developmental delay. Her parents had a consanguineous marriage and the patient had a 2 year-old brother who had microcephaly and developmental delayand a 10 year-old healthy brother. She had increased serum CK levels and muscle biopsy ndings were compatible with An autosomal recessive microcephalypanel (including 9 gene) and limb-girdle muscular dystro- phy panel (including 31 gene) with MiSeq \u00aeNGS system, were performed in the patient. Sanger seguencing was used forfamily segregation analysis. Results: We detected a novel homozygous frameshift mutation (c.621_622delAG; p.Glu208GlyfsTer23) inWDR62 gene. The 2 year-old brother was homozygous, whereas the healthy parents were heterozygous for this mutation. No pathogenic mutation was detected in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy panel. Conclusions: We have identi ed a novel frameshift mutation in WDR62 gene and to our knowledge, this is the rst case who had autosomal recessive primary micro- cephaly with concomitant sarcoglycanopathy. Further molecular studies for sarcoglycanopathies will allow us tobetter understand the genetic etiology in this patient.S. G\u00fcrsoy: None. F.

Consanguinity due to extensive homozygosity unravels many recessive pheno-types and facilitates the detection of novel gene-disease links. Here, we report two siblings with phenotypic signs including intellectual disability, developmental delay, andmicrocephaly from a Pakistani consanguineous family in which we have identi ed homozygosity for p(Tyr103His) in thePSMB1 gene encodes a -type pro- teasome subunit (i.e. 6). Modeling of the p(Tyr103His) variant indicates that this variant presumably weakens theinteractions between PSMB1/ 6 and PSMA5/ 5 protea- some subunits and thus destabilizes the 20S proteasome complex. Biochemical experiments in human SHSY5Ycells revealed that the p(Tyr103His) variant affects both the processing of PSMB1/ 6 and its incorporation into protea- some, thus impairing proteasome activity.

P08.095.B Expanding the PTEN-associated phenotype: patients de novo PTEN mutations and 1UKE, Institute of Human Genetics, Hamburg, Germany, Department of Pediatrics, Hamburg, Germany Introduction: Heterozygote PTEN variants are associated with different but overlapping diseases, such as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, Cowden syndrome,Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and macrocephaly autism syndrome. We report on two patients with de novo PTEN mutations who presented with an MPS-likephenotype. Case reports: Patient 1: A 3-year-old boy, who is the rst child of healthy parents, was referred to hospital due todevelopmental delay, macrocephaly, splenomegaly and facial dysmorphism leading to suspicion of a metabolic disease. Results after extended metabolic work up werenormal. The brain MRT revealed occipital white matter anomalies and enlarged perivascular spaces. Trio whole exome sequencing (WES) identi ed the de novo missense variant c.80A>T [p.(Tyr27Phe)] in PTEN. Patient 2: A 4- year-old girl, who is the second child of healthy parents, was referred to hospital due to macrocephaly, mild motordevelopmental delay and dysmorphic features resembling a storage disorder. Extended metabolic work up was normal. Brain MRT showed some enlarged perivascular spaces.Trio WES detected a de novo missense mutation c.103A>G [p.(Met35Val)] in PTEN. Discussion: Both patients were initially referred to hospital due to suspicion of a metabolic disease, most likely MPS, which could not be veri ed. Instead, de novo PTEN mutations were found. The phenotype does notmatch the currently described PTEN-associated diseases. This leads to the assumption that there might be anadditional PTEN-associated phenotype. Children who are suspected of having a lysosomal storage disease that cannot be con rmed should be considered for an extended genetic analysis including PTEN. T. Scholz: None. T. Bierhals: None. J.

RBL2 encodes p130, a member of the retinoblastoma pro- tein family. Previous studies on p130 knockout mice dis- playing embryonic death and impaired neurogenesis highlight the importance of RBL2 in brain development. Material & Methods: We performed Exome sequencing (ES) in two siblings with a neurodevelopmental disease and their parents. Subsequent segregation analysis was donewith haplotype analysis by GSA-Array in all four (two affected and two unaffected) siblings and their parents. Results: The two siblings share a phenotype character- ized by severe intellectual disability (no ability to stand/ walk, no expressive language), stereotypies, autoaggressive behavior, dysmorphic features identi compound-heterozygous variants RBL2 the sole candidate (NM_005611.3) in patients: A heterozygous nonsense variant in-frame deletion of exon 13-17. Subsequent haplotype analysis showed that the two disease haplotypes segregate in the family. Discussion: RBL2 , that has not been linked to a monogenic disorder yet, is the key regulator of maintaining neuron survival among the Rb family members. Thehypothesis of RBL2 as a disease gene is underscored by the gnomAD gene constraint metrics showing a depletion of loss of function variants and p130 knockout mice exhibitingimpaired data358 J. del a candidate gene for an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental delay. 231 words T.

P08.098.B Cell system with inducible transcription for the study of CGG repeat instability I. V. Grishchenko1, Y. V. Purvinsh1, I. Imatdinov1,S Novosibirsk, Russian Federation Introduction: The molecular basis of certain hereditary neurodegenerative diseases is trinucleotide repeat expan- sion, which dramatically increases the number of tripletrepeats. However, the expansion mechanism has yet to be dened. A failure of the DNA repair system at sites with alternative DNA structures formed by repeats can lead toexpansion. This work aimed to design a cellular system for studying the instability of CGG repeats involved in FRAXopathy development during transcription and TCR-NER. Materials and Methods: CGG repeats were transfected plasmids containing CGG repeats of different lengths. Transfected cells were selected using flow cyto- fluorometry or puromycin. Changes in CGG repeats were evaluated by fragment analysis. Reporter gene expression was measured by qPCR. Results: To control transcription levels, DNA fragments of CGG repeats and the EGFP ORF were inserted into plasmids under the inducible promoter TRE. Additionally, vectors encoded DsRedExpress or puromycin-N-acetyltransferase driven by a constitutive promoter. Several types of plasmids carrying CGG repeats of various lengths were generated. HEK293A cells were transfected, andtransformants were selected. In the obtained cell lines, plasmid integration sites, expression levels of fluorescent proteins and changes in (CGG)n repeat length uponinduction of TRE were determined. Conclusions: Cell lines with controlled transcription across repeats were produced. This system allows trackingchanges in the repeat region. The obtained cell lines can be used as a model to study the effect of transcription and TCR-NER on repeat instability. The study is supported byRussian Science Foundation Grant 18-15-00099.I.V. Generation Sequencing the characterization of Rett-like spectrum disorders E. Leonardi M. and Child Health, University Research Institute - Citt\u00e0 della Biomedical Sciences, University Neurology Unit, Padua, Padova, Italy, 13CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padova, Italy The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) allowed identifying a number of genes responsible of RTT and associated phenotypes (RTT-like). However, the etiology ofthe condition in a subset of RTT and RTT-like patients still remains unknown. Using the Ion Torrent platform, we developed a low-cost NGS gene panel and sequenced ca.630 samples for early ID/ASD diagnosis. The gene panel contains 74 ID and ASD related genes, including 18 known and candidate genes associated with RTT-like disorders.We identi ed de novo causative mutations or likely pathogenic variants in 18 of the 90 (20%) sequenced indi- viduals with RTT-like disorders. Among negative caseswith clinical features in the spectrum of Rett-like disorders, we performed whole exome sequencing in 31 family trios, 1 singleton, and 2 multiplex families.

The phenotype of SHFYNG in child- hood partially overlaps with that of the well-establishedPrader-Willi-Syndrome/PWS. While several studies of younger individuals with SHFYNG have been recently published, the phenotype in adulthood is not well estab-lished. We recruited 7 adults (aged 18-36) with molecularly conrmed SHFYNG and collected data regarding eating habits, sleep, behavior, autonomy, psychiatric, and medicalconditions, as well as information about the respective phenotypes in childhood. Methods: Participating individuals with SHFYNG and their families received a questionnaire covering the aforementioned areas. The legal guardians of all participantsprovided signed consent under the IRB-approved human research protocol H-34578, Baylor College of Medicine. Results: We identi ed common symptoms within our cohort, such as disturbed sleep, hypoactivity, social with- drawal, and anxiety, but noted considerable differences at the level of personal autonomy and skills. Behavioralproblems were frequent, and a majority of individuals displayed weight gain, food-seeking behavior, and mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual function.Typical symptoms of SHFYNG in childhood were reported for most individuals. Conclusions: Ourndings indicate a high variability of functional abilities and social participation of adults with SHFYNG. The prevalence of obesity was high, and lack of satiety was of concern for some caregivers. The phenotypesof PWS and SHFYNG might be more dif cult to distinguish in adults than in children. Molecular genetic testing for SHFYNG should be considered in adults with thesuspected diagnosis of PWS, if testing for PWS has been negative. F. Marbach: None. M. Elgizouli: None. M. Rech: None. J.

KBG and the mental retardation autosomal dominant syndromes, caused by ANKRD11 andSETD5 gene muta- tions respectively, belong to this broad group of disorders. We performed high resolution array CGH and trio-based360 J. del PicchiaWES on three molecularly unsolved patients with an initial KBGS diagnosis, found to carry SETD5 gene hap- loinsuf ciency. A de novo deletion of 116 kb partially involving SETD5 and two de novo frameshift variants in SETD5 were identi ed in the patients. The clinical re- evaluation of the patients was consistent with the molecularndings, however still compatible with KBGS. Phenotypic features of KBGS and MRD23 overlap to some extent, but the presence of facial features not fully consistent withKBGS can suggest differential diagnosis. Our results pro- vide further examples that loss-of-function pathogenic var- iants in genes encoding factors shaping the epigeneticlandscape lead to a wide phenotypic range with signi cant clinical overlap. To conclude we recommend clinicians to consider SETD5 gene haploinsuf ciency in the differential diagnosis of KBGS, enhancing deep phenotyping and genotyping of KBGS overlapping conditions. M.

Sleep anomalies are a heterogeneous set ofproblems, including dif culties with initiating or maintain- ing sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and parasomnias.The relationship between abnormal sleep patterns and NDDs is complex and potentially synergistic. Indeed, sleep anomalies exacerbate an already compromised neurobeha- vioral phenotype. Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) [MIM:182290], of RAI1 gene, is a NDD characterized by sleep disturbances, which in 95%of the patients results from disruption of circadian rhythm with an inverted melatonin secretion. Based on the assessed role of RAI1 in the regulation of circadian rhythm, weevaluated through RT-qPCR the expression of circadian genes in peripheral blood of 18 clinically suspected SMS/ SMS-like patients, three with con rmed RAI1 mutation, manifesting sleep disturbance except three. Out of the 6 tested genes CLOCK ,BMAL2 ,PER2 , and NR1D1 were found deregulated in at least one patient with sleep pro-blems: gene expression alterations were observed in 9 out 15 patients, whereas no dysregulation was identi ed in the 3 patients without sleep disturbance. Our data con rms a few studies suggesting a correlation between sleep disturbance in patients with molecularly de ned syndromes and expands the correlation to patients with sleep disturbancewho are molecularly unsolved. Our pivotal study needs to be validated on a larger cohort of patients and by testing also the melatonin receptor genes which due to their lack ofexpression in blood, need alternative tissues, such as buccal smears A.

Two missense variants have been reported in SLITRK2 , located on the X chromosome, in patients with schizophrenia (Piton et al., 2011). Through a collaborative study, we report on seven individuals (1 female and 6 males, including two siblings) carrying rare variants in SLITRK2 identi ed by WES. These variants include one nonsense and ve missenses changes (p. Thr312Ala, p.Arg426Cys, p.Val511Met, p.Pro691Ser and p.Val201Ile), that were never reported at the hemizygousstate in gnomAD populations. Three variants were de novoand three were maternally inherited. All patients had mod- erate to severe intellectual disability and speech delay, mostly severe. Neurological regression was observed in one patient after six years-old. Patients present behavioral issues (anxiety, aggressiveness or autism spectrum disorder) (5/6), spasticity and/or nonspeci facial features. Nonspeci c brain MRI anoma- lies (3/6) included white matter reduction, ventricles dila-tion and thin corpus callosum. Based on these observations and the role of SLITRK2 in synapse development and organization, we believe that these variants contribute to theneurodevelopmental phenotype of our patients. We aim to gather more patients with pathogenic SLITRK2 variants and to continue with functional studies, to con rm the impli- cation of this gene in neurodevelopmental disorder and to better delineate the clinical manifestations associated to mutations in this gene, especially at the behavioral level.

P08.106.A Do SMARCC2 truncating and splicing variants cause disability and developmental delay? \u00d6. Baysal , R. Pfundt, C. L. M. Marcelis Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands BAFopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by variants in genes encoding the various subunits of the chromatin-remodelling complex BRG1-associated factor(BAF). De novo variants in SMARCC2, one of core sub- units of the BAF complex, have been described as a cause of intellectual disability (ID) in 2019. Missense and splicevariants affecting the highly conserved SMARCC2 DNA- interacting domains (SANT and SWIRM) present with more severe phenotype overlapping with the phenotype ofother BAfopathies, Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Truncating variants affecting other regions show a much milder phenotype. According to datafrom the gnomAD database the loss-of-function variants (pLI-score =1), porting However, wehave now identi ed four unrelated patients harbouring predicted loss of function variants in SMARCC2 that are362 J. del Picchiainherited from healthy (grand)parents. Whole exome sequencing was performed on these patients because of developmental delay (DD)/ID. Two unrelated patients have the same frameshift variant (c.3129del, p.Gly1044fs), inherited from their healthy father. The brother of one of these patients, who had a similar DD, did not have thisvariant. A third patient (c.574C>T (p.(Arg192*)) inherited a nonsense variant from his unaffected father and grandfather. The fourth patient has a predicted splice donor variant(c.317+2T>A (r.spl.?)) inherited from her healthy mother. The presence of these truncating variants in healthy indi- viduals in four different families seems to contradict thesuspected pathogenicity of this type of SMARCC2 variants. We'll discuss the possible relation between truncating SMARCC2 ID. \u00d6. None. P08.107.B M. J. Nabais S\u00e1 1, G. El Tekle2,3,4, A. P. M. de Brouwer1,S . L. Sawyer5, D. del Gaudio6, M. J.

Interestingly, three individuals shared craniofa-cial dysmorphisms, including microcephaly, which were strikingly different from those observed in the other indi- viduals, which included (relative) macrocephaly andhypertelorism. Based on these ndings, we hypothesized that two distinct molecular pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the phenotypic differences, similarly to theobserved effect of somatic SPOP variants in cancer. Indeed, measurement of BETs levels in human Ishikawa endo- metrial cancer cells and patient-derived cell lines variants identi ed in the microcephalic indi- viduals result in a gain-of-function, while the other variants lead to a dominant-negative effect. These results suggestthat divergent functional effects on BETs are related to distinct and clinically recognizable syndromic forms of intellectual disability with contrasting craniofacialdysmorphisms.

CDG Iy is associated with developmental delay(DD), intellectual disability (ID), hypotonia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, failure to thrive and epilepsy. Carrier females are only mildly affected. SSR4 was linked with CDG Iy in 2014, and since then only 10 patients with sufcient genotype and phenotype details have been reported. We describe a 5-year-old boy with hypotonia,feeding problems, failure to thrive, DD, speech delay, microcephaly, abnormal EEG, history of seizures and facial thin upper lip Exome sequencing c.200_2001delA, p.Y67Cfs*2 which was absent from all databases. Our patient con rms that males with CDG due to SSR4 variants show consistent phenotype with DD/ID, hypotonia, microcephaly, facial feeding problems, failure to thrive and gastrointestinal and eyeabnormalities. Seizures have been reported in 6/10 previous patients, and our patient supports their involvement in the syndrome. On the contrary, skeletal, coagulation, cardiacand renal abnormalities mentioned among minor features were absent in our patient. A similar clinical picture is seenin many CDG types, and changes in serum transferrin levels in CDG Iy patients are easily overlooked.

Variants other componentsof EZH2 andEED ) have been reported Weaver syndrome and Cohen-Gibson syndrome. In 2017, Imagawa et al . reported rst of a patient with Weaver-like syndrome due to a mutation in SUZ12 . We report on an eight year old girl, born at term after uneventful pregnancy with body measurements withinnormal range. Postnatally a VSD and a persistent left vena cava were detected. Our patient has mild intellectual disability and facial features including synophrys, hyperte-lorism, long and deep seated ears. She showed no overgrowth, had mild hearing impairment and hypermetropia. In suspicion of mild Cornelia de Lange-syndrome sequencing analysis of known CdLS genes on DNA isolated from blood or broblast were conducted but could not identify a causative variant. Karyotyping was normal and array-CGH SUZ12 (NM_015355.2: c.1657C>T, p.Gln553Ter). Systematic review of the literature showed only 13 patients with pathogenic variants in SUZ12 reported so far. Nine of them had overgrowth. Missense variants appear to be stronger associated with overgrowth rather than nonsensevariants (Cyrus et al., 2020). Facial features suggestive for CdLS were not reported. Our ndings expand the phenotypical spectrum of variants in SUZ12 and link the spectrum of CdLS-like phenotypes with another chromatin associated complex.364 J. del Y. None. F.J. Kaiser: None. I.

Vanakker Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Gent, Belgium Introduction: Before the common use of whole exome sequencing (WES) in routine diagnostics, hereditary syn-dromes were de ned by distinct clinical features. However, with the increasing use of WES-based diagnostics, in par- ticular for indications with large numbers of causal genessuch as intellectual disability (ID), very mild or atypical phenotypic presentations of known syndromic causes can be observed. Methods: We present several patients with thorough clinical description, presenting with ID in whom no syndromic diagnosis was made prior to testing. A con rmed molecular diagnosis via whole exome sequencing of a targeted panel of ID genes was made with (likely) pathogenic variants in genes such as WAC ,CHD8 ,TBR1 , andSOX5 . We compare their phenotype to what has been traditionally reported in the syndromes associated with these genes and delineate mild key features useful forevaluating causality of the sequencing results. Results: Arst patient with a WAC mutation presents with a duplicated ureter and aggressive behavior. In patientswith CHD8 -related ID, early bone maturation is seen. Furthermore, pathogenic variants in TBR1 can lead to exclusively developmental delay and absent speech.Finally, lower limbs abnormalities such as seen in Lamb- Shaffer syndrome ( SOX5 ) contribute to determining the diagnosis. Conclusions: We de ne several mild but characteristic features in patients having a variant in syndromic genes, even if an overt syndromic diagnosis in them was not clear.Taking into account these mild symptoms in patients with apparent non-syndromic ID is an important help in interpreting sequencing results, particularly in case ofvariants of unknown signi cance.

Here, we present a targeted custom NGS panel (Agilent- SureDesign), developed for patients in the Rett/Angelman phenotypic spectrum. The panel includes coding regionsand splice site junctions of 25 genes, causing disorders with overlapping clinical phenotypes such as Pitt-Hopkins and Mowat Wilson. Bioinformatics using Surecall (Agilent) along with in-house established pipelines. The panel design proved successful with a mean target depth of 550X andmean uniformity of 99%. Upon validation, 74 patients were referred for testing. Thirty patients had classic Rett or Angemann Syndromefeatures and were tested by Sanger sequencing and MLPA/ MS-MLPA analyses for MECP2 orUBE3A as a rst tier test. Six were found positive for deletions or pointmutations (one of which mosaic) and were included in the panel only as blind positive samples. All positive blind samples were successfully identi ed. Out of the 68 undiagnosed patients that were analysed with the panel, 9 (6 novel) were found to have de novo pathogenic variants in UBE3A, EHMT1, CTNNB1, con rmed with Sanger sequencing. Additional 11 patients were found to have a VOUS, yielding a total detection rate of atleast 13%. This custom designed panel will improve clinical detection rate and provide a comprehensive accurate testingfor individuals suggestive of a disorder in Rett/Angelman spectrum. A. Alexandrou: None. A.

Macro-autophagy vital for long-lived, non-regenerating and metabolically active neu- rons. In 2012 a founder variant in the autophagy-related gene TECPR2 was identi ed in three Bukharian Jewish families. The ve affected individuals were homo- zygous and showed spastic paraplegia complicated bysyndromic intellectual disability. Subsequent reports of ve unrelated individuals with this or novel truncating/missense variants con rmed autonomic involvement as descent with neurodevelop- mental disorder (NDD) and epilepsy. RT-PCR on PAXgene stabilized blood showed normal expression of the c.2829delallele in the heterozygous parents and gel electrophoresis indicated no expression reduction in the index. Together these results suggest escape from nonsense-mediated decay.Through matchmaking we identi ed one additional unre- lated individual with NDDs TECPR2 -variant (c.1319del, p. (Leu440Arg fs*19)). Based on these cases and comparison with the 10 literature cases, we now provide a Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) standardized clinical synopsis.The neurologic spectrum comprises muscular hypotonia with progression to spastic paraplegia in the rst decade, abnormal re flexes and autonomic involvement. The variable neurodevelopmental disorder present in 11/12 cases can be complicated by structural brain abnormalities (7/8 cases with brain MRI) and seizures (3/12). Because NDD is acentral feature in addition to the neurologic presentation, we propose to classify this disease as TECPR2 -associated congenital disorder of autophagy. S. Neuser: L. O 'Grady: None.

To date, only four different patients have been reported from two unrelated families. Patient and Methods: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis was performed in a 4-year-old male patient with tall stature, macrosomia, macrocephaly, dysmorphic facialfeatures, recurrent pulmonary joints laxity, prominent super- cial blood vessels, developmental delay and speech delay. He had consanguineous parents. Result: A homozygous frameshift variant gene (NM_004214.5) was detected and classi ed as pathogenic variant. Additionally, in the Toll-Like uncertain signi cance. Conclusions: Two variants in FIBP gene previously detected in patients with TROFAS have a loss-of-function effect putatively similar to the variant in our patient which caused putatively a premature protein. The patient had ahistory of recurrent pulmonary infections, cryptorchidism and spontaneous erection, unlike reported patients. It is not known whether our patient 's history of recurrent pulmonary infections is a component of TROFAS because of the limited number of patient reports. Primary immunode- ciencies and polymorphisms in TLRs are associated with susceptibility to infections in humans and animal models and also TLR5 has protective effects against bacterial infections. Owing to the limited number of reported patientswith TROFAS, new patient reports and further studies are needed to clarify the clinical properties of the disease. A. Sezer: None. A. Sava :None. G.

Here wereport a patient presenting with KOS and harboring two undescribed splicing variants in UBE3B . We describe new clinical features and in vitro characterization of the twovariants. Case presentation: The propositus is an 18-year-old boy microphtalmia,bilateral tetralogy of Fallot, scoliosis, hip malformation and facial dysmorphism consistent with KOS. Other clinical features not described in KOS includeanal imperforation and cryptorchidism. Results: and c.1622 +1G>C, each one inherited from a healthy parent. None of the variants was found in population databases. Minigeneassays were performed to evaluate the effects of both variants in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. The c.1956+3G>C induced skipping of exon 18 with a shift in the reading frame. The c.1622 +1G>C variant resulted in the retention of the rst 61 bp of intron 15 and the immediate insertion of a stop codon. The two variants weretherefore predicted to be highly deleterious. Conclusions: We expand the phenotype of KOS, further highlighting the interest of in vitro assays to demonstratecausality of new splicing variants.K. Uguen: None. C. Ka: None. M. Planes: None. S.

P08.116.B A novel loss of function mutation of the WAC gene in a subject with intellectual disability and autistic features associated with encephalopathy related to status epilep-ticus during slow sleep E. Leonardi M. Italy Alterations of the WAC gene have been recently associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intel- lectual disability, neonatal hypotonia, behavioral problems, and mildly dysmorphic features. To date only 20 indivi-duals have been reported with WAC mutations, which, in the majority of the cases, are de novo loss of function (LoF). Using targeted deep sequencing, we screened a cohort of600 individuals with variable degrees of intellectual dis- ability and identi edve WAC rare variants: two variants were inherited from parents; two previously repor-ted de novo mutations, c.1661_1664del (p.Ser554*) and c.374C>A (p.Ser125*);and a novel c.381 +2T>C variant causing the skipping of exon 4 of the gene, inherited from areportedly asymptomatic father with somatic mosaicism. A phenotypic evaluation of this individual evidenced areas of cognitive and behavioural de cits. The two individuals with previously reported WAC mutations presented phenotypic differences in comparison with reported cases. The patient carrying the novel splicing mutation had a clinical history ofencephalopathy related to Status Epilepticus during slow Sleep (ESES), only recently reported in WAC individuals. This rst report of a WAC somatic mosaic remarks the contribution of mosaicism in the etiology of neurodeve- lopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

It is considered a classic epileptic encephalopathy (EE). We designed a diagnostic sequencing panel targeting 131 genes associated with epilepsy and/or EE and screeneda cohort of 45 individuals with clinical diagnosis of West syndrome. We identi ed disease-causing single nucleotide variants in 11 out of 45 individuals affecting genes com-monly associated with West syndrome (such as CDKL5, ARX) but also in genes pre- dominantly linked to other epileptic disorders (such as DEPDC5, SCN1A, WDR45,AARS). Panel analysis revealed copy number variants in two additional cases, comprising a 6,7 Mb Duplication on chromosome 2 including SCN2A and SCN3A and asupernumerary marker chromosome 15 leading to an overall diagnostic yield of 29% (13/45). In our cohort, individuals with a disease-causing variant had signi cantly more severe phenotypes with respect to DD/ID, therapy resistant epilepsy and cerebral atrophy compared to genetically unclari ed cases. In addition to investigating the genotypic spectrum of West syndrome, we compared the phenotypic spectrum ofclaried versus unclari ed cases. Our study illustrates that West syndrome is an electro- clinical syndrome caused by various genetic disorders. Individuals without detectable genetic cause might have less encephalopathy leading to a less severe course. \u00a9 2019 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Pub- lished by Elsevier Ltd.

P08.120.C Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome: clinical and molecular characterization of 11 patients from four Portuguesehospital centers S. Fernandes 1,C. S. Rosas1, M. Soeiro e I. Soares6, Ramos1,5, J. M. de Lisboa, Central, Lisboa, Portugal, 4IPO, Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal,8University Clinic of Genet- Coimbra, Portugal Context: Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome (WSS) is an autosomal dominant condition comprising intellectual dis- ability, short stature, typical facial features and hyper-trichosis. It is caused by loss-of-function variants in KMT2A gene, leading to chromatin remodelling defects. Methods: Clinical and molecular characterization of all cases with WSS diagnosis from 4 Portuguese hospital centres based on retrospective analysis of patient medical records. Clinical exome (7/11) or KMT2A targeted NGS (4/ 11) was or is being performed in all cases. Results: We describe 8 male and 3 female unrelated patients. The age of diagnosis ranged between 2 and 18years. The main reasons for referral were intellectual disability (8/11) and dysmorphic features (7/11). Most368 J. del Picchiaindividuals had mild to moderate intellectual (11/ 11), (9/9), bridge (10/11). Hypertrichosis cubiti was present in 10/10. Short stature was present in 3/11 individuals, recurrent infections in 4/7and sleep apnoea in 2/6 cases, one requiring non-invasive ventilation. We identi ed 7 novel KMT2A heterozygous variants and 3 previously described pathogenic variants.One case is awaiting for results. Discussion: Our data are in accordance with the literature, except for short stature which seems to havelower prevalence than expected. Clinical suspicion is often challenging as the phenotypic variability is wide. In 6/10 cases, the diagnosis was not initially considered and in 4 ofthose only achieved by reverse phenotyping. Detailed description of national cohorts of WSS patients contributes to awareness and better-informed counselling andmanagement. S. Fernandes: None. C. S. Rosas: Soeiro e S\u00e1:None. I.

Homozygous c.5054C>G (p. (Ser1685Trp)) has been reported in two brothers with an intellectual disability (ID) syndrome.Methods: SNP genotype data were used for mapping the disease locus in Family I. Gene variants were identi ed by exome sequencing. Results: All of the patients we describe have ID, ranging from mild to profound, and reduced motor and cognitive skills plus variable features including short stature, micro-cephaly, developmental delay, hypotonia, dysarthria, deaf- ness, visual problems, behavioural anomalies, pubertal onset and facial dysmorphism.Werst mapped the disease locus in the large family (Family I) and identi ed homozygous ZNF407 c.2814_2816dup (p.(Val939dup)) in the four patients ofthe family, and then added to the study two patients of different ethnic origins with biallelic ZNF407 variants: homozygous (p.(Arg962Gly)) and c.3642G>C (Lys1214Asn)) in patient Family III. Conclusions: Our ndings con rm that ZNF407 is a recessive neurodevelopmental disease gene, biallelic var- iants of which can manifest with ID and wide phenotypicvariability. The observation that all four variants found in our patients are predicted as benign on canonical transcripts by computational algorithms indicates that many othervariants may have escaped identi cation as causal in this large gene with extreme loss-of-function intolerance.

Many are aware ofcardiac anomalies associated with this uncommon genetic disorder. However, the different types of seizures, neu- ropsychological pro le, EEG, and MRI ndings seen in this condition are not well appreciated.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 369Methods: Through 2010 tell 2019, Medical records of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome were retrospec- tively reviewed for documentation of Neurological/neurop- sychological evaluation, seizure types, EEG, and brain MRI ndings. Results: 28 patients were collected. 6 (21.4%) patient have epilepsy, 3 have focal epilepsy and 3 have generalized epilepsy and all of them were controlled on AED. Brain MRI performed in 16 patients: normal in 6 patients (37.5%),abnormal in 10 patients: polymicrogyri cortical 3 with average intellectual ability, 9(30%) with intellectualdisabilities of variable range. 3 patients suffered of neuropsychiatric illness. Conclusions: Patients with 22q11.2DS have a high risk of epilepsy. Patients with brain malformations should have a chromosomal microarray (CMA) performed to screen for the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

Beysen1, Edegem, Belgium,2Department of Pediatric Neurology, Queen Paola Children 's Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium,3Center for Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp, Edegem, Belgium,4Center for Medical Genetics, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium Introduction: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a clinical descriptive term that de nes a heterogeneous group of non-progressive, neurodevelopmental disorders of motor impairment, which co-occur with a wide range of medical conditions, such as intellectual disability (ID), speech/language de cits, autism, epilepsy and visual and/or hearing impairment. CP is caused by a cerebral anomaly/dysfunction that develops during pregnancy, birth or infancy. CP is still the most commoncause of physical disability in childhood with an important impact on the quality of life of patients and, by its high prevalence of 1.5-2.5 per 1000 live births, even on society.Recent studies demonstrate an important contribution of genetic factors.Methods: At the Antwerp University Hospital, we therefore perform genetic testing for CP using SNP-array and a targeted whole exome sequencing-based gene panel consisting of approximately 200 genes associated with CP and CP-mimics. Results: We report the ndings on two siblings from a consanguineous family presenting with spastic CP, and mild to moderate ID. Brain MRI showed hypoplastic corpus callosum and periventricular white matter abnormalities.WES demonstrated the homozygous pathogenic variant c.1100G>A (p.Gly367Asp) in ADD3 in both cases. Conclusions: In literature, only one report describes a homozygous ADD3 variant as a cause of CP in a consanguineous family with similar clinical ndings of spastic quadriplegia or diplegia, variable ID and cerebralwhite matter abnormalities. Interestingly, the same variant was identi ed in our family, which suggests the possibility of a founder mutation. Our ndings con rm the role of ADD3 in CP. T. Beyltjens: None. C. Dielman: None. D.

Paracchini1 1School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom,2Department of Psychology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 3Psychology Department, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong Introduction: The cerebral hemispheres differ in structure and function underpinning specialisation for cognition,perception, and motor control. Atypical brain asymmetries have been implicated in psychiatric and neurodevelop- mental conditions. Handedness is often used as a proxy forbrain asymmetries and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest a genetic association with schi- zophrenia, while other laterality measures are less explored.Here, we investigate shared genetic components between behavioural laterality phenotypes and their relevance to these conditions. Methods and Results: We performed GWAS on hand, foot, eye and ear preference in a longitudinal British cohort (ALSPAC, n > =5770). Our results suggest an involvement of genes associated with immune response (footedness) and370 J. del Picchiaaxonogenesis (eye, ear preference). In line with previous research, genes involved in body asymmetries were associated with handedness. The relevance of neurodeve- lopmental conditions was tested using gene set enrichment analyses and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder.PRS for ADHD were associated with left- and more strongly with non-right-handedness, but not with other laterality phenotypes. Multivariate structural equationmodels (SEM) (genome-wide genetic markers in ALSPAC and classic multivariate SEM in a Chinese twin cohort ( n= 486)) revealed shared genetic factors for hand and foot, butnot eye preference, suggesting a dissociation of motor and sensory laterality. Conclusions: These results give further support to a shared biology between laterality and neurodevelopment, which is potentially mediated by brain asymmetry.

P09.006.A Assessment of SORL1 rare variants segregation in Alzheimer disease families and in vitro models show reduced penetrance and oligogenic inheritance G. Nicolas , C. Schramm, L. Miguel, M. Lacour, S. Rousseau, D. Wallon, C. Charbonnier, and CNR- MAJ, F 76000, Normandy Center for Genomic and Personalized ROUEN, France rare loss-of-function (LOF) and missense predicted (Mis3) variants have rst been identi ed in early-onset Alzheimer Disease (EOAD, onset 65) probands with a pedigree suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Then, increased burdens of rareSORL1 LOF and Mis3 variants were reported in AD patients with odds ratios ranging from 1.9 to 29. Hence, using SORL1 rare variants for genetic counseling appears debatable. In addition, a functional effect of Mis3 variants cannot be inferred from bioinformatics predictions only. Methods: We included families with a rare LOF or Mis3 variant, evaluated their segregation, and developed a functional assay. Results: We studied 20 families with a LOF variant (mean age at onset (AAO) in probands, 55.4 years, range: [48-65]). Seventeen showed a positive family history. MeanAAO in affected relatives was 66.3 [50-80]. One patient carried two LOF compound heterozygous variants. DNA was available in 18 relatives: 5/6 affected relatives carried the familial variant (AAO =[61-78]) while 3/12 unaffected were also carriers, aged 42, 71 and 95, respectively. Strikingly, 57% affected carriers were APOE4 +, a strong AD risk variant, including one being homozygous, who also carried a LOF ABCA7 risk variant. We introduced one LOF variant and one Mis3 variant using CRISPR/Cas9 in iPSCs and observed increased levels of Ain the supernatant. The proband carrying this Mis3 variant was APOE4 +and carried a LOF rare ABCA7 risk variant. We are now assessing additional missense variants. Conclusions: SORL1 LOF variants are not fully penetrant and can be observed in an oligogenic context. G. Nicolas: None. C. Schramm: None. L. Miguel: None. M. Lacour: None. S. Rousseau: None. D.

It has been reasonable that the younger age at onset is, the higher the risk of genetic condition gets. To identify the causative nucleotide variant for the disease, westudied a Japanese pedigree consisting of a trio of a patient with sporadic young-onset PD and unaffected parents. The patient was a 35-year-old male. He had noted involuntarymovement of slow torsion in his right shoulder and forearm at the age of 31. He also noticed slow torsion in his left toe and dragged his left foot in every evening at the age of 34.On neurological examination, he showed dystonic posture in his right wrist, mild hypertonus and bradykinesia in his right upper limb, hyperre flexia and mild spasticity in the lower extremities. showed no abnormality.

Whole-exome sequencing of the trio combined with strict criteria revealed an X-linked nonsense variant (NM_001669: c.1556C>T [p.Arg498X]) in the ARSD gene encoding arylsulfatase D. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis ver- ied that the mRNA expression level of ARSD was sig- nicantly reduced in the patient 's peripheral blood cells probably due to the nonsense mediated decay. This is the rst record of a disease associated with a variant of the ARSD gene. S. Miura: None. T. Shimojo: None. R. Fujioka: None. Y. Uchiyama: None. H.

Brain volume is highly heritable and is partly regulated by variation in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Rare mTOR-related variantsassociate with macrocephaly ciated with intracranial volume (ICV) in the generalpopulation. We hypothesized that variations in mTOR- related genes could mediate the occurrence of enlarged brains in ASD. Materials and methods: Looking at rare de-novo mTOR-related variants, we estimated enrichment of macro- cephaly and ASD using a local ID cohort (N =2,257) and publicly available resources ( n=32,991). Looking at common variants in a unique set of mTOR-related genes, we estimated association with ASD (N =46,350) and ICV (N=25,974) using publicly available data. Using the same data, we estimated 1) genome-wide genetic correlation between ASD and ICV and 2) mTOR-restricted ASD-ICVgenetic correlation. Results: We found a signi cant macrocephaly and ASD in for common mTOR-related variants revealed signi cant independent associations with ASD (p =0.002) and ICV (p =0.021). While no signi cant genome-wide ASD-ICV genetic correlation was present (p=0.81), we show a signi cant positive mTOR-strati ed genetic correlation (p =0.027). Conclusions: Our study shows that both rare and common mTOR-related genetic variations contribute to ASD and brain volume. These results are compatible with amodel in which variable mTOR activation may drive both larger brain volume and ASD risk. M. Arenella: None. N.R. Mota: apraxia: molecular basis and M. Santos 1, J.

HCAs share clinical features and disease mechanisms with hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs), with several ataxia-relatedgenes found to cause HSPs and vice-versa. In this study, we used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to unravel the variant myelin-associated gly- coprotein (MAG). Cellular studies con rmed its detrimental effect. Our results showed that this variant reduces proteinstability, impairs post-translational been asso- ciated forms of HSP. Our MAG variants with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. The low expression and premature degradation ofthe mutant protein showed the variant to cause protein loss- of-function. This work has also expanded the clinical should, therefore, be considered in the diagnosis of HCAs, in addition to HSPs. M. Santos: None. J. Dam\u00e1sio: None. C. Kun-Rodri- gues: None. C.

Material and Methods: In a large family with 9 sympto- matic patients, we aimed at identifying a new genetic causeof SCA by performing exome sequencing combined to whole analysis. in NPTX1 , segregating in all affected cases. This mutation was recurrent in 2 independent pedigrees without a common founder effect and another missense mutation, E327G, wasidenti ed in a smaller pedigree with two affected patients. The phenotype in these 4 families is a late onset (range 34- 71 years) slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus,cognitive impairment, myoclonic tremor and mild cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Both mutations affect conserved amino- acid residues in the NP1 protein and are extremely rare ormissing from public databases. We show that both mutations alter the endoplasmic reticulum morphology and induce ATF6-mediated stress, ultimately leading toincreased cytotoxicity in COS7 cells. The E327G change also abolishes the protein secretion, as well as the formation of NP1 complexes. In silico modeling of thecomplex evidenced a destabilizing effect for the E327G change, located at the interface between monomers. No phenotype-genotype correlation could be established. Conclusions: We suggest that mutations in NPTX1 can lead to spinocerebellar ataxia via endoplasmic stress, following a dominant negative complex-destabilizing pro-cess or a direct alteration of the protein function.

IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Bosisio Spectrum is a neu- rodevelopmental condition with complex etiology.Although genetics play a key role in ASD, causative or predisposing genetic variants have been detected only in 30% of patients. Here, for the rst time, linked-read whole genome sequencing of ASD patients is used to access dis- ease associated regions unmappable by short-reads NGS. Materials and Methods: 10 children with ASD, including 3 couples of affected siblings, were enrolled and HMW DNA isolated from peripheral blood. DNA was submitted to 10Xgenomics micro fluidics partitioning and barcoding, library preparation and Illumina WG-NGS. Data were analyzed through 10x Long Ranger pipelines to nd SNVs, in/dels aggregation database and NHLBI-ESP populations. Genes affected by variants were compared with those already known to be associated withASD (SFARI database, large-scale sequencing studies, bioinformatics predictions). Results: this approach successfully produced sequences up to 9mln bp in length. Among the detected variants, 405 were listed in SFARI, 43 con rmed bioinformatics predic- tions and 3,210 were new. Among the latter variants, 22were homozygous in all the 3 couples of siblings. Conclusions: this powerful approach deciphered under- lying genomic heterogeneity and missing variations inASD. Further studies will be performed to validate the new ASD variants in a large size of samples and in public data.Data integration will be also performed to identify pathways and gene networks involved in the disorder to understand disease mechanisms and design target-driven treatment.

This study aimed to compare the level of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and transcriptional activity of mitochondrialgenes in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of ASD patients (ASDP) and healthy controls (HC). Materials and Methods: The study included 20 ASDP and 15 HC aged 4 to 10 years. PBL DNA was isolated from plasma using phenol extraction. mtDNA content in PBL DNA samples was determined by non-radioactive quanti-tative dot-hybridization. PBL RNA was isolated with RNeasyPlusMiniKit( 'Qiagen '). Expression of 85 mitochon- drial genes including those involved in regulating redoxmetabolism, to stress, mitophagy, mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial ssion, mitochondrial transports, and those that encode for proteins of I-Vrespiratory complexes, was evaluated using real-time PCR. Results: There were no signi cant differences in mtDNA levels between patient and control groups. Analysis ofmitochondrial gene expression revealed 3-5 fold elevation of transcript levels for UQCRFS1 ,SC01 , and MT-ATP6 genes (complex III, IV, and V, respectively) in PBL of ASDpatients compared to those of HC. Besides, PBL of ASDP were characterized by heightened expression of PINK1 gene (tenfold) involved in mitophagy as well as FIS1 (twofold) andMFN2 (fourfold) genes regulated mitochondrial ssion and fusion, respectively.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 375Conclusions: Increased transcriptional activity and mitophagy genes in PBL of ASDP may be associated with adaptive response maintaining functional mitochondria under disease-related metabolic or/and envir- onmental RFBR grant 17-29-06017o _m.

Martiniano1,2, A. Marques1,2,C . Integrative Sciences Institute, Universidade de Lisboa,Lisbon, Portugal Sequencing studies have yielded several candidate genes for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the biological mechanisms underlying its onset are still unclear. Envir- onmental factors may modulate ASD risk, with heritabilityestimates of 50-80% supporting a role for gene-environment interactions in idiopathic cases. We hypothesize that ASD candidate genes interact with reported ubiquitous environ-mental risk factors. Thus, we interrogated the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) for interactions between 1144 ASD candidate genes and 59 ASD-risk chemicals. Aproportion analysis was performed to identify genes that selectively interact with ASD risk chemicals (and vice- versa). Genetic data from ASD-individuals n=2674) and CNVs ( n=3570). Eleven genes, encoding for sex receptors (AR,ESR1 and ESR2 were found to selectively with ASD- chemicals. Meanwhile, heavy metals, endocrine disruptors(pesticides, benzo(a)pyrene and a phthalate) and valproic acid were found to selectively target ASD-candidate genes. In ASD-cases, we found 22 loss-of-function or deleteriousmissense and MAPK3 ) were CNVs. External cues may dysregulate the MAPK signaling cascade, leading to neu-rodevelopmental problems. Hormone-mimicking toxins act as agonist/antagonist ligands to hormone receptors, whileSLC7A5 is a blood-brain barrier (BBB) transporter. Sex hormones and BBB are fundamental during early devel- opment. We highlight the need of considering genetics and environment as interacting entities. Efforts to collect early- life exposure data from genetically susceptible patients may accelerate the implementation of health management stra-tegies for ASD. J.X. Santos: None. H. Martiniano: None.

ASD has a complex multifactorial etiologywith high genetic involvement. Previous unpublished data suggested that inversions 17q21.31 and 8p23.1 could act as susceptibility variants. The purpose of this project is toelucidate the transcriptional consequences of these rearrangements. Materials and Methods: We performed RNAseq analysis of peripheral blood in 13 idiopathic ASD patients and 11 controls grouped by homozygous inversion376 J. del Picchiagenotypes: non-inverted; inv8p23.1; inv17q21.31. discover expressed genes (DEGs) with p.adj.value < 0.05. Results: We found that inversions affect the expression of genes encompassed in each inverted region and genes elsewhere in the genome. Regarding inv17q21.31, wediscovered 38 DEGs, 8 from the region and some of them associated to neuronal diseases the interaction of phenotype- genotype, no regional genes were found deregulated. We discovered 27 DEGs for inv17q21.31 including somerelated for inv8p23.1 we found 73 DEGs of which 4 have been previously related to ASD ( ABCA13,SLC7A8, STX1A,SLC24A2 ). Conclusions: Our data indicate that inversions have a direct effect on gene expression patterns both in invertedregions and elsewhere in the genome. Moreover, we note that ASD carriers of the susceptibility alleles (inv17q21.31/ inv8p23.1) have differential expression of brain function-related genes. Further studies are needed to determine the involvement of these deregulated genes to the ASD phenotype.

Gabau: the identi cation of neurotransmission and synaptic risk genes and processes Autism de Sa\u00fade Dr. Ricardo Jorge, Lisboa, Portugal,2University of Lisboa Faculty BioISI -Biosystems Ci\u00eancia, Oeiras, PortugalAutism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by communication de cits and repetitive behavioral patterns. ASD has a strong genetic component and there is evidence supporting many putative risk genes. However, the genetics underlying the disease is unclear. Our objective was to identify neurotransmissionand synaptic (NS) genes that play a role in ASD. For this purpose, we de ned 1216 NS candidate genes ltering for the terms 'neurotransmitter 'and'synapse 'in Gene Ontol- ogy, Reactome and KEGG, and overlapping the gene list obtained with the synaptic databases SynaptomeDB and SynSysNet, and with literature review. We then searchedthe Whole Exome Sequencing dataset from the Autism Sequencing Consortium (3938 cases) for ultra-rare loss of function (LoF) Single Nucleotide Variants (MAF < 0,1%;gnomAD 60146 controls) in these genes. We selected 434 LoF variants in 244 genes and identi ed the biological pathways enriched in these genes using Reactome. Apply-ing the Louvain community detection algorithm to the network spanned by the selected genes and edges from the STRING database of protein-protein interactions, we iden-tied several biological communities within the network: MAP Kinase, Calcium and G alpha signaling, Interleukins receptors, Energy/Insulin metabolism, Phos-pholipids, Nicotinic acetylcholine and NMDA/AMPA receptors. Finally, we constructed a network-based gene rank through the computation of topological parameters andcentrality measures in Cytoscape. The genes PRKCA, GNG13 and ANK2 involved in phosphorylation, trans- membrane signaling and membrane stabilization of iontransporters and channels, which are important processes for the brain function, are the top-ranked genes.

ASDs have a complex multifactorial etiology, with genetic causes being recognized in 25-35% of cases. Array comparative genomichybridization studies showed that copy numer variants (CNVs), in particular rare and those encompassing brain- are associated with idiopathic ASDs. Weapplied oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of kpz to evaluate its usefulness for identi - cation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 528patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients 'genomes were performed using genome-wide, high-resolution (180K) array to accurate detection of copy number varia-tion at the exon level. Probes have been designed to target 4645 genes including 227 genes relevant for etiopatho- genesis of ASDs. Chromosomal microarray analysisrevealed 116 nonpolymorphic CNVs, ranging in size from 9.3 kb to 8.16 Mb, in 100 (19%) patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were identi ed in 42 (8%) patients, whereas CNVs with uncertain clinical signi cance were identi ed in 68 (12.8%) of cases. Due to high resolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 37 CNVsthat could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k).

It has a life-time prevalence of about 1%. The disease manifests itself by reoccurring episodes of depression and mania. BD is acomplex disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Formal genetic studies have esti- mated a relatively high heritability of approximately 75-80%. Our actual project focuses on the identi cation of rare risk variants for BD that segregate in 12 multiply affected families from Andalusia/Spain with a total of 71 indivi-duals, using whole exome data. Methods: To identify risk variants that segregate within the pedigree we set up an analysis pipeline using acommercial software. The work flow includes trimming of reads, mapping to the reference genome, removal of duplicates, local realignment and variant detection. Variantsthat matched the segregation pattern were further analyzed using different prediction tools and for known candidate genes. Results: We have identi ed 138 '000 missense variants, which were familywise present in all affected and none of the healthy members. These variants were annotated usingdbNSFP, including several different prediction scores. As a rst approach to identify causative variants, we looked at the overlap with the 30 loci described in the BP2 GWASfrom the PGC (Stahl, E.A. et al. 2019). We found 18 mutations in BD associated genes, 3 of them being rare. SYNE1 is outstanding, as 9 mutations pertain to this gene.Next steps will comprise following up of these mutations using biological pathway analysis tools and starting analysis of identi ed frame-shift mutations.

Loss of C9orf72 protein function, a toxic RNA gain- of-function and a gain of function by RAN translation havebeen proposed as triggering pathological mechanisms. In addition, mitochondrial defects have been described to be a major driver of disease initiation. MtDNA copy number hasbeen proposed as a useful biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated the role of mtDNA copy number in the pathogenesis C9ALS/FTD. Material and Methods: Total mitochondrial and geno- mic DNA was extracted from postmortem human prefrontal cortex brains from 18 C9orf72 samples and 11 controls. ThemtDNA copy number was assessed by digital droplet PCR. Results: A statistically signi cant decrease C9orf72 samples mtDNA copy number in C9orf72 frontal cortex brainsamples. This association was independent of age and gender. Conclusions: A growing number of studies demonstrated the in fluence of mtDNA copy number reduction on neurodegeneration.

Since its discovery in 2011, many research groups havetried to assess its frequency in several neurodegenerative disorders, reporting differences among populations and phenotypic heterogeneity. The aim of the present study is toidentify the C9ORF72 expansion in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders in Greece (ALS, HD-like syndromes, dementia, Parkinson 's disease-PD, Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia \u2014HSP) and healthy controls. Using molecular biological techniques including Repeat-Primed PCR (RP-PCR) 860 patients (399 with ALS, 44 with HD-like syndromes, 224 with dementia, 178 with PD and 15 with hereditary spastic paraplegia, HSP) and 321 controls were tested for the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. Thirty-eight patients with ALS (9.5%), 2 with HD-like syndromes (4.5%), 8 with FTD (8.5%), 1 with AD (1.7%), and 2 with PD (1.1 %) were expansion-positive. The expansion wasnot detected in the HSP or control group. The results of this study provide an update on the spectrum of C9ORF72 - related neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing theimportance of establishing C9ORF72 as a diagnostic test in laboratory routine for both familial and sporadic patients.

Here we aim to understand the underlying pathomechan- ism of the CDKL5 de ciency disorder (CDD), a rare genetic disorder that causes seizures, developmental delay,and severe intellectual disability, by studying the Cdkl5 phenotype at single cell resolution. The CDKL5 encoded protein is a kinase responsible for normal neuronaldevelopment, synapse formation and signal transmission, but the mechanism(s) by which loss of CDKL5 expression leads to disease remains unclear. We studied total brain isolated whole cells from hemizygous Cdkl5-knockout male mouse embryos (E18.5) by single-cell RNA sequencing were able toidentify numerous cell-type-speci c phenotypes. Our single-cell approach provided the necessary resolution to detect previously unidenti ed transcriptional changes and molecular states compared to wildtype mice. Additionally we identi ed altered pseudotemporal trajectories of Cdkl5 decient brain cells during embryonic development. Our data provides new insights into the molecular pathomechan- ism of CDD and highlights the potential of single-cell RNA sequencing as a phenotyping tool for mouse models ofneurodevelopmental disorders.

Pilz 1, K. Schwefel1, A. Weise2, P. Felbor1, M. Rath1 1Department of Human Genetics, University Medicine Greifswald, and Interfaculty Institute of Genetics and Functional Genomics, University of Greifswald, Greifs- wald, Germany,2Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany,3Institute of Medical Diagnostics, dominant cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are leaky vascular lesions that can cause epileptic seizures and stroke-like symptoms. Germ- line mutations in either CCM1 ,CCM2 orCCM3 are found in the majority of patients with multiple CCMs or a positive family history. Recently, we have identi ed the rst copy number neutral inversion in CCM2 by whole-genome sequencing in an apparently mutation-negative CCM family. Material and Methods: We here asked the question whether further structural genomic rearrangements can be detected within NGS gene panel data of unsolved CCM cases. Hybrid capture NGS data of eight index patientswithout a pathogenic single nucleotide, indel or copy number variant were analyzed using two bioinformatics pipelines. Results: In a 58-year-old male with multiple CCMs in his brain and spinal cord, we identi ed a 294 kb insertion within the coding sequence of CCM2 . Fine mapping of the breakpoints, multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli cation veri ed that the structural variation was an inverted unbalanced insertionthat originated from 1p12-p11.2. As this rearrangement disrupts the CCM2 gene on 7p13, it was classi ed as pathogenic. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that efforts to detect structural variations in known disease genes increase the diagnostic sensitivity of genetic analyses for well-dened Mendelian disorders.

FARCY1,2, A. Di Cicco2, A. Baffet2, N. Imagine, Paris, France,2Institut Curie, Paris, France The cortex is the centre for our complexes cognitive capa- cities. Its development is a highly regulated process. Thedynein protein is a unique molecular motor and is crucial for intra-cellular traf cking. Our team identi ed mutations in the gene coding for the dynein in patients with micro-cephaly. Interestingly, distinct mutations within this same gene lead to a different phenotype, the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Why some mutations affect the cortexdevelopment and some doesn 't remain unclear. The project is focus on the cortex, and aim to investigate which speci c neuronal dynein functions are altered, and how it can lead tomicrocephaly. In order to study dynein-dependant functions during cortex development, I generate cerebral organoids, 3D structures that fully recapitulate the human features ofthe developing cortex. I reprogrammed two cell lines from patients caring mutations leading either to microcephaly or to SMA into pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) and differentiatethem into cerebral organoids. Neuronal defects have been observed only in the organoids mutated for the micro- cephaly. The rst observation was a strong reduction in the size of the organoids, which correlates with the patient 's phenotypes. In those same organoids, an alteration of the neural stem cells proliferation have been observed as well asan increase in the number of apoptotic cells. I am using the live imaging technique, a new outcome in the eld. This technique allows me to investigate in real time the divisionof the neural stem cells as well as the newborn neurons migration to their nal location. S. Farcy: None. A. Di Cicco: None. A.

Accumulating evidence suggests a signi cant genetic contribution. Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing (ES) was performed on 1,777 patients with CP. Positive cases harbored one or two pathogenic or likely pathogenic alleles,depending on mode of inheritance, in a single gene. Results: ES yielded a positive result in 27.5% of patients (488/1777). Causative variants were identi (19.9%), and X-linked disorders (14.1%), encom- passing 238 different genes. Trio testing revealed a high denovo rate (71.5%). Linear modeling indicated that the likelihood of harboring a pathogenic variant was higher in patients with multiple co-morbid neurodevelopmentaldisorders (OR =1.34; 95% CI =1.18-1.53; p analysis from one study center ( n=208) showed that individuals lacking CP risk factors were 8-fold morelikely to have a genetic etiology when controlling for score (95% CI =2.33-52.59; p =0.0052). Conclusions: ES identi ed a genetic etiology in more than a quarter of CP patients, supporting genetic testing in this group. Although recurrent CP-associated genes were elucidated, the results revealed vast genetic heterogeneity,underscoring the need for a broad genetic testing approach for CP. The high rate of de novo ndings supports utilizing trio-testing. Individuals with multiple co-morbidities weremore likely to have a positive nding, as were those lacking traditional CP risk factors. Genetic testing of patients with CP can inform an accurate recurrence risk, and provideinformation for prognosis, adjusted therapies, and manage- ment options. F. Millan: A.

This condition is characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, per-ipheral neuropathy and developmental delay. One hetero- zygous de novo missense alteration (Thr991Ala) has been reported in a patient with progressive, early-onset neuro-pathy with normal cognition. Materials and Methods: We performed diagnostic trio exome sequencing on three affected individuals and theirparents. We collected clinical and electrophysiological data. Wild-type and In three unrelated individuals, we identi ed two different de novo missense alterations (Arg207His and Tyr679Cys) in SLC12A6 . Arg207His was found recurrent in two patients. Functional analyses demonstrated a signicant reduction of K+influx in all mutant with cognition and MRI. Conclusions: We conclude that heterozygous de novo SLC12A6 alterations can cause intermediate CMT, a milder phenotype than the autosomal-recessive disorder, Ander-mann syndrome. Although the patients with de novo variants in SCL12A6 had a homogenous phenotype, the biophysical properties of all mutant cotransporters weredifferent. Furthermore, less is known about the role of histidine or cysteine on Arg207 that causes different inheritance patterns. J. Park: None. B. Flores: None. K. Scherer: None. H. K\u00fcpper: None. M.

Here we describe a new association with a truncating homozygous mutation in CHDH gene, not associated with any disease until now. Materials and methods: A 70 years old man, son of second-cousins, presented with progressive spastic ataxia since his fties, ptosis, autonomic features, diffuse leukoencephalopathy and cortical atrophy. Routing screening for acquired forms was performed, along with common causes of ataxia caused by dynamic expansions.Exome was sequenced with xGen Exome Panel v1.0, NextSeq 500 by Illumina. Validated OMIM genesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 383were analyzed and broad search in all candidate genes was performed in search of homozygous potentially pathologic mutations. Results: No common SCAs nor Friedreich Ataxia expansions were detected. Exome analysis failed to nd any variation amongst 33 validated genes causing auto-somal recessive SA. Broad analysis extended to all OMIM and no OMIM genes led to identify a ultrarare frameshift mutation, c.386del (p.G129Vfs*89) in mitophagy with other genes SQSTM1, PARK2 and TMEM70, which cause different neurodegen- erative diseases through mitochondrial dysfunction whenmutated. Functional studies are ongoing. We propose CHDH as candidate gene for autosomal recessive neuro- generative diseases presenting with SA, inexplicableleukoencephalopathy or cognitive decline. C.

NDDs include autism spectrum disorders, intellec- dis- orders, attention-de cit/hyperactivity, epilepsy, speci c learning problems and motor disorders. The risk of devel- oping NDDs seems to be highly in fluenced by the effect of rare but recurrent copy number variations (CNVs). Methods: We have analysed the ndings of CNV studies from a cohort of 1170 patients with NDDs referred for clinical geneticist evaluation. The analysis was conductedusing Agilent 60K oligonucleotide array-based comparative 1170 patients with NDDs and CNVs were identi ed in 89 children (7,6%). We identi ed 45 duplica- tions considered to be pathogenic, 11(12,3%) likely pathogenic and 31 were variants of unknown signicance (VUS). In 15 patients two or three copy number alterations were present. Conclusions: A rare CNVs contribute to a signi cant proportion to the risk of deve loping NDDs.

This term describes a syndrome characterized by typical par- kinsonian features, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and resting tremor, and other clinical signs aty-pical for Parkinson 's disease (PD). The signs are different for each disease, but they share the pathological384 J. del Picchiamechanisms: they presented intracellular protein aggrega- tion in the brain of tau or -synuclein, which is thought to be the cause of the development of the disease. Mutations in genes encoding tau and -synuclein have been identi ed as risk factors for these diseases. DCTN1 encodes the largest subunit of dynactin complex essential in the retrogradeaxonal transport and cytoplasmic transport of vesicles; mutations in DCTN1 have been reported predominantly in individuals with Perry syndrome and, recently, in patientswith PSP. Here we performed a mutational screening of DCTN1 in 207 patients with atypical parkinsonisms from Italy. Material and Methods: The cohort included 79 patients with PSP, 100 patients with MSA and 28 patients with DLB. A control group of 500 healthy subjects from thesame geographical area was also examined. All 32 exons and intron-exon boundaries region of DCTN1 were sequenced. Results: Sequence analysis revealed only a synonymous variant in one of PSP case, and two intronic variants with the same frequency in patients with atypical parkinsonismsand healthy subjects cohort. Discussion: DCTN1 mutations have not a key role in the development of atypical parkinsonisms in the Italianpopulation. R. Procopio: None. M. Gagliardi: None. M. D 'Amelio: None. L. Brighina: None. G.

Bencsik1, A. Ill\u00e9s1, Moln\u00e1r1 1Institute Rare Disorders, Semmelweis University, Hungary,2Department of Neurology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hun- gary Introduction: Dementia is one of the most common neu- rodegenerative disorder with a previously suggested het-erogeneous genetic background. In the recent years the increasing availability of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has made it possible to better understanding thegenetic background of this disease group. Materials and Methods: In our study 111 Hungarian patients with relatively early onset dementia (mean age ofonset was 56 \u00b1 7.41 years) were pre-screened for the most common AD or FTD associated genes by Sangersequencing and C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. In subjects without positive results ( n=56), targeted panel sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform. The common AD genetic risk factors, APOE and MTHFR genotyping were performed too. Results: In the most common dementia associated genes (PSEN1 ,PSEN2 ,APP, GRN ), mutations were detected in 8.1 % of the cases. Abnormal repeat number for C9orf72 gene was identi ed in 6 cases. Further heterozygous possibly damaging alterations were detected by NGS in other genes such as TREM2, ABCA7, PLA2G6, C19orf12, PARK7 . In some cases the coexistence of a genetic risk factors and a rare variant indicating monogenic dementia has additive effect on the phenotype. Conclusions: In our study, variants with potential association with the early onset dementia were identi ed in 20.7% of the investigated cohort. With the application of NGS both rare damaging variants and genetic risk factorscould be effectively identi ed, which could contribute to understand the complex genetic architecture of dementias and could be helpful for genetic counselling.

However, the current studies are performed predominantly in Europeanpopulations, and information in more ethnically diverseAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 385groups is lacking. This study aims to search for the monogenic causes of DEEs in Latin-America. Materials and Methods: We ascertained 316 patients from different countries: Brazil (223), Argentina (57), Chile (15), Peru (14), Uruguay (4), and Honduras (3). To date, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 100 patients. Forgenetic variant selection, two lters were used: i) read depth (RD10), allele frequency in control population ( 1%) and exonic consequence; ii) 129 known genes related to DEEs.For variants of interest selection, three criteria were used: considered deleterious by variant effect predictors, impact in the protein, presence on dbSNP and CLINVAR. Results: The mean RD was 30X, and the mean percentage of targets with at least 10x RD was 89%. The mean number of genetic variants per patient was 19,5341before the lters and 22 after the lters. We selected sixty- three variants of interest in 41 genes from 49 individuals for further studies. From the selected variants, 51 are missense,5 nonsense, 4 frameshift indel, 2 in-frame indel, and one affects a splicing site. According to the American College of Medical Genetics classi cation 52 variants are of uncertain signi cance, 9 likely pathogenic, one likely benign, and one pathogenic. Conclusions: The combined lters and selection criteria used identi ed genetic variants of potential clinical interest in 49% of Latin-American patients with DEE. H.T. Moraes: None.

Olfactory dysfunction may be an early clinical symptom of AD. Recent studies show that vitamin D 3(VD 3) has neuroprotective effects in mouse models of AD. In this study, we evaluated the effectsof VD 3on the olfactory bulb (OB) in mouse model for DS. Materials and Methods: Female mice with 14-week-old of the lineage B6EiC3Sn-Rb(12.Ts171665Dn)2Cje/CjeDnJwere distributed into experimental groups: (Ts Wt (VD3)), and for 10-week with common diet (CO) or 12.500 IU/Kg of VD 3. At twenty-fourth week old the mice were euthanized. The OB was were analyzed statistically (P < 0.05). The F-(F) and H- statistic (H) were used to analyze between-groups factors(trisomy; vitamin D 3; interaction). Results: Trisomy reduced the volume of the external plexiform layer (F =4.313; P =0.046), number of mitral cells =9.941; (F 9.802; P 0.0001) and MTHFR (F=13.191; P =0.002) and increased the volume of the mitral cell layer (F =5.398; P =0.034).

It is an autosomal dominant disease withincomplete penetrance. The clinical symptoms of dystonia- 28 are development microcephaly, focal or gen- eralized dystonia, gait dif culties and toe walking. Materials and methods: We present a 7-year-old girl with clinical symptoms of generalized dystonia. Motor386 J. del Picchiadevelopment is delayed - keeps his head from a fore month, sits from a ten month, walk from a year. At the age of 2 years, she started walking on \"socks\" and instability was observed. At the age of 6 years, after infections, there was tension in the muscles of the left leg, involuntary move- ments, a turn of the left leg when walking, tiredness due towalking. The dystonia was progressive and eventually became generalized with involvement of the upper limbs, hands, neck, face, tongue, and trunk. She had microcephalyelongated face, dysarthria, generalized dystonia, and spasticity. EEG and MRI of the brain were normal. Results: Analysis of whole genome sequencing data revealed a previously undescribed heterozygous variant .3626G>A in KMT2B gene. This variant was not detected in either parent and was con rmed with Sanger sequencing. Conclusions: We report clinical case with undescribed heterozygous variant KMT2B in the girl with a clinically recognizable form of dystonia.

Our group was among the rst to report bi-allelic mutations in RNF216, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as the genetic cause of Gordon Holmes syndrome (GHS), an adult-onset rare neurodegenerativedisorder characterized by ataxia, dementia and hypogona- dotropic hypogonadism or Huntington-like disorder (HDL). To date, >10 mutations in RNF216 have been reported not only from the catalytic active site but also from N-terminal part of the protein. Objective: We intend to unravel the mechanisms by which RNF216 mutations lead to GHS and HDL. We aim to identify novel RNF216 mutations for genotype- phenotype correlation studies, identify protein compositionof the pathological intranuclear inclusions, and understand the cellular and biochemical function of the RNF216 protein. Methods: Frozen and xed brain material from patient were used for generalized proteomics and neuropathological studies and patient broblast and Hela cells were used for cellular studies. Results: We describe a Spanish patient with HDL having 2 novel compound heterozygous missense mutations inRNF216. The study of brain material from one of the two reported Belgian families demonstrated ubiquitin- and p62- positive intranuclear inclusions, negative for Tau, - synuclein and TDP-43. Proteomics generated a list of candidate genes whose histopathological examination is currently ongoing. Hela cells transfected with bodies. Conclusions: The identity of intranuclear bodies should be further analyzed hoping to reveal molecular intricacies linked to this neurodegenerative disease. Odysseus None.

By Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) great advances have been made in gene discovery for EIEE and several studies emphasized de novo variants as major underlying cause. Current diagnostic pathways allow molecular diagnosis tobe made in about 20% of cases with EIEE and recent studies have also highlighted extreme genetic heterogeneity. Therefore, the current scenario indicates that most of thegenes responsible for EIEE are probably still unknown. To this regard, our group recruited 21 patients (and their par- ents) with EIEE or epilepsy of unknown origin, negative forthe presence of micro-arrangements, and investigated by WES, in the frame of the multicentric project EPI-IDEA, which is part of the RETE-IDEA network constituted byeight Italian pediatric IRCCS. In our study, we identi ed a pathogenic or very likely pathogenic variant/genotype in about 48% of the patients. Only in 2 patients a de novomutation was identi ed, whereas 64% of diagnosed cases were caused by recessive genes previously associated with a seizure-related phenotype/s, including ve compound het- erozygosity for causative sequence and 2 homozygous. 27% of the mutations were novel variants not described before. 10 patients are currently still under investigation. Ourresults con rm a relevant role of mostly compound het- erozygous recessive inheritance for EIEE with important implication for genetic counselling. L. Musante: None. C. Zanus: None. P.

The etiology of epilepsy remains unknown in 40-50% of cases, although it is well known that approximately 30% causes is genetic. According to recent studies, the copynumber variants (CNVs) are important factors in this dis- order (2-11%). We used array CGH method in a cohort of 90 patients with epilepsy, and neurodevelopmentalabnormalities with or without dysmorphic features. Array CGH analysis was performed using genome-widemicroarray with average resolution of 30 kb (180K, OGT) with speci cally designed coverage for over 212 selected genes, known or candidate to play an important role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 33 CNVs (17 duplications, 15 deletions, 1 tripli- cation) in 29 out of 90 (32.2%) patients with epilepsy. 2pathogenic CNVs were detected in 2 patients from our cohort. 9 potentially pathogenic CNVs, and 22 CNVs with unknown clinical signi cance were detected in 27 indivi- duals. All of the identi ed CNVs were submicroscopic in size, ranging from 1.7 kb to 8.85 Mb, and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis.Additionally, 17 CNVs (51%) could not have been detected by our clinical microarray (60K).

Both families were clini-cally assessed in detail and mutation analysis was performed using Clinical Exome Sequencing(CES) with388 J. del PicchiaIllumina platform. In the rst family CES revealed a fra- meshift deletion (c.194delT,p.Leu65ArgfsTer3) affecting theGRIN2A and Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures(GTCS), motor aphasia and moderate intellectual disability (ID). In his pedigree we diagnosed a total of seven additionalaffected members all having GTCS with onset around 4-6 years of age. The GRIN2A gene encodes a subunit of N- methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA) receptors found in excitatorysynapses with role in neural plasticity. GRIN2A mutations are associated with focal epilepsy with speech disorder with or without cognitive disability. In the second family CESrevealed a possibly pathogenic splice-acceptor variant c.216-1G>A in exon 2 of the LGI1 gene. This family consists of a total of eight affected members. The probandpresented a fever-provoked GTCS, while his rst-degree relatives have GTCS preceded by auditory aura and later development. are associated with partial epi- lepsy with auditory features. Con rmation Sanger sequen- cing showed that the variants segregate with disease phenotype in all available affected members from each family. Both variants are absent in public databases. Furtherinvestigations are needed to elucidate the splice-site muta- tion effect on RNA level. The study was supported by Grants DTK/67/2009 and DUNK/01-2/2009 of NSF, MES,Bulgaria. V. Peycheva: None.

Recent studies on largeAmerican or European cohorts showed that susceptibility genes for GGE are numerous and their variants rare, chal- lenging their identi cation. In this study, we aimed to assess the GGE genetic etiology in a Sudanese population. Methods: We collected 13 large consanguineous families with GGE from Sudan including 34 patients to search forGGE susceptibility genes. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in DNA samples of probands from 13 families. We ltered non-silent ultrarare/rare variants identi ed in each family and compared them with publicly available data and ethnicity-match controls. Results: We identi ed in a family of 3 siblings with GGE- TCS one ultra-rare missense variant in ADGRV1 , a recently involved in the pathogenesis of myoclonic epilepsies. Five additional ADGRV1 ultra rare/rare missense variants segregated with GGE in three of the remaining families. The frequency of this class of ADGRV1 variants was signi cantly higher in our cohort compared to gnomAD African controls (P =0.0018). A homozygous patient for an ADGRV1 variant presented a more severe phenotype than her heterozygous brother, suggesting a dosage effect. Signi cance: Our study showed for the rst time the segregation of ADGRV1 variants with familial GGE, epilepsies to CAE/JAE and GTC epilepsy.

Here, we present, our work on contribution of EFHC2 in predisposition to JME. EFHC2 encodes a protein DM10 domains and a putative EF-hand motif. EFHC2 is expressed in the mammalian brain regions: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cere-bellum. In cultured mammalian cells, it localizes to the spindle poles and midbody. We have identi ed seven potentially pathogenic EFHC2 variants present almost exclusively among 500 JME patients examined. On over- expression of EFHC2 carrying these variants, signi cant levels of spindle abnormalities, multi-polarity and chro-mosome segregation defects are observed. We analyze the contribution of the DM10 domains to subcellular localiza- tion and function of the protein. EFHC2 is a homolog of EFHC1 , a known JME causing gene. Cellular defects caused by EFHC2 variants in cultured mammalian cells are partially rescued by EFHC1, and vice versa. EFHC2 co-precipitates with -tubulin and -tubulin suggesting that EFHC2 is a microtubule-associated protein. EFHC2 's role in microtubule organization during cell cycle are beingcurrently studied.

De novo, mostly loss of function variants cause a spectrum of epi-leptic disorders. These have recently been divided into four groups: (1) Genetic epilepsies with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), (2) Genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), (3) Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) and (4) Focal epilepsy. Most patients with STX1B -associated epi- lepsy can be classi ed as GEFS +, whereas those with GGE or focal epilepsy are less common. Materials and Methods: We screened our diagnostic in- house exome sequencing database comprising 4000 datasetsfor cases with de novo and/or loss of function variants in STX1B and reviewed the clinical information of the respective patients. Results: We identi ed four patients with pathogenic or and the clinical spectrum ranged from febrile and afebrile seizures to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy withcerebral malformations. Conclusions: Our ndings con rm the broad clinical spectrum of STX1B associated epilepsies. We identi ed three loss of function variants in differently affected individuals implying that a one-to-one genotype- phenotype correlation cannot be established. M. Schl\u00f6gl: None. M.

Seeman1 1DNA laboratory, Department of Pediatric Neurology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic,2Department of Pediatric Neurology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic,3Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic Introduction: Epileptic encephalopathies (EE) are severe epilepsies of childhood with early onset of usually drug-390 J. del Picchiaresistant seizures and developmental delay or regression. Their etiology is extremely heterogeneous. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used in patients previously unsolved using standard diagnostic methods and clinical experience. Patients and Methods: Here we present WES results of 48 EE patients. These patients were selected based onprevious experience by the expert in epilepsy genetics from the cohort of patients unsolved after targeted NGS gene panel. Results: To date, causative variants were found in ten patients (20.8%) in genes explaining the cause (12.5%), seven suspected variants of unknown causality were found and wait to be validated and interpreted byfamily segregation or phenotype con patients, we found variants in genes not associated with EE or any other human disease (KCNJ4 ,TULP4, PHYHIP ). Five variants out of twenty presented were already published before (by differentauthors) and the rest of them are novel. Conclusions: WES represents ef cient tool for clari ca- tion of various EE types. It has an important potential fornovel candidate genes detection, however, international collaboration is required for searching other patients for genotype-phenotype con rmation. WES may help in selected patients to obtain genetic diagnosis in those who remained unclari ed after targeted NGS gene panel (up to 40% of patients). Supported by: MH CR AZV 15-33041 L.

FAME is genetically heterogeneous with 6distinct disease-causative genes identi ed over the last two years. Notably, all share an emerging common pathomole- cular mechanism consisting in the expansion of non-coding(intronic) pentanucleotide repeats at distinct loci. We report a novel three generation FAME pedigree with 3 affected subjects and a healthy carrier. Two sibs had full-blownFAME phenotype, while a 32-year-old girl manifested only myoclonus starting at age 25. Molecular genetics investi- gation by means of repeat primed repeat refer- ence sequence was not identi ed in the expansion. Sanger sequencing con rmed an apparent loss of heterozygosity in affected members and, more interestingly, depicted a com- plex structure of wild-type (not expanded) alleles. Of note,ATTTC-STARD7 expansion was con rmed in the unaf- fected 89-year-old mother of affected sibs. To our knowl- edge this is the rst report of reduced penetrance in a molecularly con rmed STARD7 expansion carrier indivi- atypical wild-type alleles broadens the STARD7/FAME2 locus. L.

We also found that Foxp1 +/-animals display a reduced striatal expression of proteins biogenesis and , Tfam, Opa1 and Drp1), suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the symptoms. To address this issue in moredetail, we investigated mitochondria in WT and Foxp1 +/- animals. We demonstrate that Foxp1+/-striatal neurons display a disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential. Inaddition, we detected an increased abundance of reactive oxygen species, increased cytochrome C release as well as lipid peroxidation in the Foxp1 +/-striatum. In summary, our results indicate mitochondrial dysfunction in murine Foxp1 deciency, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress may also contribute to the de cits in FOXP1 Syndrome.

Miller2, G. Kim2, K. Usdin2 1KwaZulu-Natal (KRISP), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban,South Africa, 2Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States The Fragile-X related disorders (FXDs) are Repeat Expan- sion Disorders (REDs) that result from expansion of aCGG-repeat tract in the FMR1 gene. While expansion affects both disease risk and severity in humans, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible is unknown.Despite a high frequency of expansions in vivo, existing patient-derived cell models do not show signi cant repeat instability. Here, we describe the generation of mouseembryonic stem cells (mESCs) carrying an expanded CGG- repeat tract in the endogenous murine Fmr1 gene. We show that these cells show high frequency repeat expansions,visible in a matter of days in culture. Moreover, using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, we show that theseexpansions are dependent on MSH2, a factor essential for expansions in vivo. Altogether, our data has implications for the timing of expansion and allows these cells to be useful for modeling the expansion mutation. Additionally, we demonstrate that these cells have abnormalities con- sistent with human disease including elevated mitochondrialcopy numbers and Fmr1 hyperexpression, that we show is O 2-sensitive. Thus, this new stem cell model should facil- itate studies of both expansion and the consequences ofexpansion during early embryonic development. I. Gazy: None. C. Miller: None. G. Kim: None. K.

Rodriguez-Revenga is a late-onset neurodegenerative with that in premutation carriers (55-200 CGGs). The neuropathological hallmark ofFXTAS consists of presence of ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions that are broadly distributed throughout the brain. Additionally, bioenergetic de cits and mitochondrial dys- function have been also reported. Since autophagy promotes cell survival by elimination of damaged organelles and proteins aggregates, we aimed to study its potential role inthe pathogenesis of FXTAS. Material and Methods: Skin broblasts formation (LC3-BII content) (VDAC1 expression). Results: The analysis of autophagic flux in skin broblasts cultures evidenced enhanced autophagic path- way activation and increased mitochondrial amount in FXTAS patients compared to controls. Increased autopha-gosome number was also con rmed by confocal microscopy. Conclusions: These ndings suggest that despite the increase in autophagic flux, abnormal cell waste may contribute to the pathology of FXTAS broblasts by causing the accumulation of incomplete degraded mito-chondria, among other subtracts. As a result, we postulate392 J. del Picchiathat FXTAS broblasts suffer from a bioenergetic collapse, leading to cell stress that triggers cell death.

Straniero1, V. Rimoldi1,2, S. G. Milan, Milano, Italy, Istituto Neurologico Introduction: 's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting more than 1% of the over-65 population. To date, mutations in the GBA gene, coding for the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, represent the most frequent cause of genetic PD. Besides GBA , other lysosomal genes have also such as SMPD1, NPC1 , and SCARB2 . The reason why patients with the same mutation may or may not develop neurodegeneration and PD is still unclear. To this end, we evaluated the impact of the burden ofdeleterious mutations in lysosomal genes in patients het- erozygous for pathogenic GBA mutations vs asymptomatic GBA -mutation carriers. Materials and Methods: This analysis was performed using a custom NGS panel by exploiting a DNA pooling strategy. The panel included 50 genes responsible forlysosomal storage disorders (LSD) and all previously reported PD-genes to evaluate if they contribute to PD penetrance in GBA -mutation carriers. Results and Conclusions: Statistical analysis revealed a signicantly increased burden of deleterious variants inLSD genes in PD cases (P =0.003). In particular, the 36% of patients was carrier of at least one mutation in an LDS gene compared to the 23% of controls. Moreover, performing single-gene analysis, we observed that a second mutation in GBA represents the strongest modulator of GBA itself (5% vs 1%, P =0.012). The identi cation of genetic lesions in lysosomal genes increasing the risk to develop PD may contribute to classify patients in subgroups most likely to benet from existing and upcoming targeted therapies.

P09.069.A Modelling motor-neurons in a dish to study the effects of a homozygous codon-stop mutation in GDAP1 respon- sible Limoges, France Introduction: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, the most common inherited peripheral neuropathy in humans, iscaused by mutations in more than 90 genes. Among these, GDAP1 encodes for a mitochondrial protein important for mitochondrial dynamic and protection from ROS. However,motor neurons (MNs), the mainly involved cells in this neuropathy, cannot be obtained from patients. Our goal was to generate MNs derived from iPSc (induced-pluripotent-stem-cells) in order to investigate the effects of GDAP1 - mutations. Materials and Methods: We created iPSc from bro- blasts of two unaffected subjects and a CMT-patient carrying a GDAP1 homozygous codon-stop mutation. iPSc were differentiated in neural progenitors (NP), then in motorneurons (MN). To study GDAP1 expression, we realized RNA-extraction, qRT-PCR immunocytochemistry. Electronic microscopy functional tests GDAP1 mRNA expression in Fibroblasts, iPSc, and MNs, on controls 'cells, we observed that GDAP1 is mostly expressed in neural cells (NPs and MNs), showing the importance of generatingAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 393MNs to study GDAP1 mutations effects. Interestingly, in all patient 's cell types, GDAP1 expression was low, suggesting that GDAP1 mRNA, containing a premature termination codon (PTC), is probably degraded by the nonsense- mediated-decay (NMD) system. These results have been conrmed by immunocytochemistry. Then, we analyzed morphological and functional properties of our cellular models. Conclusions: Cellular models are useful tools to investigate the impact of genomic mutations on functional level. Our study highlighted the importance of employing the good cellular model (MNs), to study the alteredmolecular mechanisms associated to GDAP1 -mutations in CMT disease. F. Miressi: None. N.

Moln\u00e1r Institute of Genomic Medicine and Rare Disorders, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: Telomere length was previously shown to be decreased in several neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington 's Disease (HD) while mitochondrial DNA copy number changes were reported to show con flicting results. Simultaneous measurements and detailed data on disease severity is lacking. Materials and methods: HD patients and preclinical patients (pathologic CAG expansion carriers) were staged (n=142) based on the Shoulson-Fahn clinical staging system (Stage I-V. and preclinical). A healthy control group was used ( n=71). mtDNA copy number and telomere lengths were measured with real-time PCR technique. Results: For preclinical HD patients the average telomere length is 133.8 (\u00b188.2) (kb/cel) and mtDNA copy number mtDNA copy number copy number is 326.5 (\u00b1127). We did not have any stage IV and V HD patients. Average telomere length for the controlpatients is 167.3 (\u00b184.7) while mtDNA a signi cantly (p < 0,05) lower telomer length and higher mtDNA copy number than healthy controls. Both telomere length and mitochondrialcopy number decreased with HD disease severity (with a small spike in Stage I patients) but the changes were not statistically signi cant in that regard with the given sample sizes.

Till date, 316 monogenic and 2 chromosomal disorders are desig-nated as LD/gLE. Though neuroimaging was the key to diagnosis over last two decades, broad-spectrum genetic394 J. del Picchiatesting has now taken a central role in diagnosis. Methods: We reviewed literature to retract a list of genetic disorders with white matter abnormalities. We also evaluated 109 individuals from 101 families with white matter abnormal- ities. Exome sequencing (ES) was performed for genomic evaluation. Results: Literature review rendered 445 condi- tions with white matter abnormalities. One-hundred-and- two conditions present with hypomyelination and 343 conditions have de/dysmyelination. Of the total, 129 dis-orders have not yet been designated as LD/gLE but have predominant white matter abnormalities. Diagnostic yield of ES in heterogenous cohorts of individuals with white matterabnormalities has been noted to be in the range of 40-50%. ES has led to discovery of 63 novel conditions with white matter abnormalities in the past decade. In our cohort of 109families, 14 had hypomyelination and 95 had de/dysmye- lination. Molecular diagnosis was established in 67 families (66.33%). Thirty-eight (59.37%) of 64 disease-causingvariants were novel. ed.Conclusions: The spectrum of genetic disorders with white matter abnormalities is ever-increasing and ES has emerged as a highly ef cient modality for diagnosis of known conditions as well as elucidation ofnovel conditions.

Kenis1, Roeselare, Medical Genetics, Uni- versity of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium,4Center for Medical Genetics, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium Introduction: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a clinical descriptive term de ning a heterogeneous group of non-progressive, neurodevelopmental disorders of motor impairment, which co-occur with a wide range of medical conditions, includingintellectual disability, speech and language de cits, autism, epilepsy and visual and/or hearing impairment. Recentstudies demonstrate an important contribution of genetic factors. Materials and methods: We performed diagnostic genetic studies in 100 CP-patients that are followed at the Pediatric Neurology department using a whole exome sequencing (WES) based gene panel consisting of 200genes associated with CP and CP-mimics. Results: Here, we report the presence of de novo KIF1A variants in a relatively large proportion of our CPpopulation (7/100 patients tested, 7%). These variants were located in the KIF1A motor domain, absent in control databases, predicted pathogenic by in silico prediction programs and reported as likely pathogenic (class 4/5) or pathogenic (class 5/5). Patients presented with develop- mental delay and mild to moderate ID (7/7), spasticparaplegia axonal motor protein, have been described to cause variable neurological disorders. This is the rst report in which de novo KIF1A mutations are demonstrated to be an important cause of CP associated with early onset spasticity and a frequent nding of periventricular white matter abnormalities.

M. van der Werf 1,2, M. of the EHMT1 gene is the cause of Kleefstra Syndrome (KS), a disorder characterized by intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and spe- cic facial features. EHMT1 encodes the Euchromatic Histone 1 (EHMT1) protein, which in complex with EHMT2 can deposit methyl groups on histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1/H3K9me2), importantepigenetic marks for gene repression. Ehmt1 heterozygous knockout of Ehmt1 , shows phe- notypic resemblance of the human disorder with develop-mental delay, learning and memory de cits, craniofacial abnormalities and diminished response to social novelty. ToAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 395evaluate social behaviour in the Ehmt1+/-mouse model in more depth, we used the recently developed Live Mouse Tracker system (de Chaumont et al. 2019). This system can automatically track and score behaviour of a group of mice in a home cage-like setting. We recorded Ehmt1+/-mice and their wildtype littermates over time periods of 23 hours andanalyzed general activity, isolated behaviour, dyadic inter- actions and group dynamics in familiar social contexts, thereby excluding social novelty. Our results indicate thatEhmt1 +/-mice are generally hypoactive when compared to wildtype littermates and display speci c social behaviour decits, in particular in group dynamics. These phenotypes will be further investigated as endpoint measures for phe- notypic rescue in drug studies.

Materials and methods: This retrospective study included patients followed in our center with con rmed WSS. Data from the medical records were abstracted, recorded in an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using simplefrequency analysis. We compare these patients with previously reported cases.Results: We described 14 unrelated patients with pathogenic mutations in KMT2A . All the mutation occurred de novo. Age at diagnosis ranged from 2 to 19 years, sex ratio 1. All patients presented with global developmental delay with a wide range of severity, only 14% with severe intellectual disability. 86% of the patients have difculties of the patients had an hypertrichosis whose more than half with hairyelbow. Abnormalities of craniocervical junction were reported in 4 patients (29%). Two patients developed conductive deafness. Conclusions: This study improved the description of natural history of WSS, especially about neurological development. Moreover, our cohort emphases the impor-tance of early detection of craniocervical junction abnorm- alities and deafness. C. Ormieres: None. S. None. G. Barcia: None. S. Lyonnet: None. A.

DLD presents sive comorbidity with other disorders like dyslexia andADHD. DLD is highly heritable but few genes have been identi ed so far. Through an exome sequencing analysis we identi ed a rare missense mutation (chr16:84405221 G>A (GRCh38.p12)) in the ATP2C2 gene. Exactly the same variant was reported previously in a different exome sequencing study for DLD, and ATP2C2 was previouslyproposed as susceptibility gene for language disorders by linkage and association studies. We followed this nding up by genotyping the mutation in cohorts selected for DLD andcomorbid disorders. We found that the variant had a higher frequency in DLD cases (1.8%, N =360) compared to396 J. =520) and ADHD (0.7%, =150), reference databases (0.9%, N =24,046 gnomAD con- trols). Analysis of quantitative phenotypes in the ALSPAC birth cohort showed that carriers (N =42) of the variant had, as a group, lower mean scores on a range of reading andlanguage-related measures compared to controls (N =1825), e.g. carriers had a mean score 0.4 SD lower than non- carriers on a phoneme awareness task. We are currentlyinvestigating the potential effects of this variant on protein function with a range of biochemical and electrophysiology assays.

P09.085.B Contribution and consequences of LIS1 dosage in mechanism LIS1 Gerard12, Bahi- Buisson1,2,13 1Genetics and Development of the Cerebral Cortex, Imagine Institute, Paris, France,2Sorbonne Paris Cite University, Paris, France,3University Hospital of Martini- que, Martinique,4Meyer Pediatric Aix-Marseille University, Paris, of Paris, France, Diseases, IGBMC, Illkirch, Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris, France Introduction: LIS1 is an ubiquitous protein of which loss of function mutations lead to lissencephalies, whereas LIS1 overexpression causes microcephaly. This suggests cerebral development is very sensitive to LIS1 dosage. The maingoal of this project is to evaluate the dose-effect impact of LIS1 on the different degrees of lissencephalies 'severity.Material and methods: Four lines of broblast from patients with LIS1 de novo heterozygous mutations were used. Two of them displaying a severe phenotype carry an intronic mutation (c.1002 +1G>T) or a missense (c.445C>T) while the two other patients presenting a less severe phenotype display a splice site mutation (c.569-10T>C). LIS1 transcripts and proteins were quanti ed and the subcellular distribution of the protein was visualized by immuno fluorescence. Analysis of LIS1 mRNA showed that the c.569- 10T>C mutant transcripts were degraded while both c.445C>T et c.1002 +1G>T mutant transcripts, associated to the severe phenotypes, were not. Yet, no difference of LIS1 protein level was detected between patient and control lines, by Western Blot. But, immuno fluorescence targeting LIS1 after proteasome inhibition allowed the detection of clusters in broblasts associated to the severe phenotypes (c.1002 +1G>T ; c.445C>T). Conclusions: In LIS1 lissencephalies, our data suggest that more severe forms would be associated to an abnormal repartition of the LIS1 protein forming clusters afterproteasome inhibition, which might be toxic for the cell. Recent studies indicate the clusters might be stress granules, membraneless organelles involved in post-transcriptionalregulation and translational control, formed by RNA-RNA, protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions, in which LIS1 would bind RNA-binding proteins.

Genetics Research -Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Cluster, Vrije Universiteit of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 397The development of the cerebral cortex is a complex pro- cess and pathogenic variants in >200 genes have been associated with malformations of cortical development (MCD). Yet, the etiology still remains to be elucidated in a large group of MCD patients. The proband of this study, a17-year old boy presented with a complex brain mal- formation including severe cortical dysplasia, Parents are non-consanguineous. proband has a simple arachnoid Whole exome in the MAN2C1 (NM_006715.3) gene. This variant was not reported earlier and classi ed as variant of uncertain signi cance (VUS 3). TheMAN2C1 gene encodes a cytosolic mannosidase and is involved in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. Possibly, as a consequence of the accumulation of proteins,the organization and maturation of neurons is altered during fetogenesis. Preliminary RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of MAN2C1 is downregulated in broblasts compared to controls, although this downregulation was not signicant. The variant in MAN2C1 causes a \u00b1 50% decrease in cytosolic alpha-mannosidase enzymatic the patient compared to controls. RNA ana- lysis in patient and control broblasts showed up/down regulation of multiple glycosylated proteins. The functionalconsequences of the detected variant and the exact role of the MAN2C gene in the development of MCD need further investigation. L. Kerkhove: None. H. Yildirim: None. S. Seneca: None. A.

Some of the MCD causative genes have been identi ed, but part remain unknown. Here, we describe a patient with heterozygous variants in the C-terminal domain phosphatase 1 ( gene, a gene potentially involved MCD. functions as a phosphatase which depho- sphorylates the C-terminus of RNA polymerase II, makingit available for initiation of gene expression. A 2.5-year old girl presented with congenital arthrogry- posis, periventricular unilateral auditory neuropathy.

(Arg889Trp). assess the gene expression levels of CTDP1 , real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is performed. The phosphataseactivity of CTDP1 was assessed by performing western blotting (WB) of its target RNA polymerase II. RT-PCR data showed a non-signi cant downregulation of CTDP1 expression in the patient versus controls. By performing WB, more phosphorylated RNA polymerase II was detected in patient cells. Our preliminary analyses show that the phosphatase activity of CTDP1 is altered in the patient compared to controls, supporting its role in MCD. CTDP1 is involved inthe regulation of RNA polymerase II and forms a complex with INTS1 and INTS8. Variants in the latter genes result in a phenotype similar to that of in our index patient, furthersuggesting a role for CTDP1 in brain development. H. Yildirim: None. L. Kerkhove: None. B.I.

Main examples of MCD are lissencephaly, heterotopia, and polymicrogyria. MCD place a signi cant burden on affected individuals, their families and society, aspatients often suffer from lifelong symptoms including drug-resistant epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and intellectual dis- ability. Although next-generation sequencing has becomebroadly available worldwide, marked differences in diag- nostic yield remain due to broad genetic and clinicalheterogeneity and lack of guidelines in the recognition and classi cation of these rare disorders. Methods: The international network on brain malforma- tions Neuro-MIG formed a multidisciplinary task force. Through expert meetings, literature search, and the Delphi consensus method a diagnostic strategy for individuals withMCD was developed. Results: We present consensus recommendations on the optimal work flow applicable to any individual with MCD. This includes a flow chart for the clinical work-up, laboratory standards, and a curated MCD gene panel list. In addition, we discuss the differential diagnosis, possiblediagnostic pitfalls and special recommendations for speci c MCD subtypes. Conclusions: These recommendations will aid clinicians in providing the optimal diagnostic strategy, which will improve genetic and prognostic counseling and patient care.

Biallelic mutations in 25 genes have been demonstrated to cause MCPH, and the numbers are growing with more inclusive and cross dis- ciplinary collaborative approaches. Materials and Methods: This study analyzed two consanguineous MCPH families (Pakistani and Syrian) through homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequen-cing (WES). The functional consequences of the candidate variants were studied by immuno fluorescence, confocal microscopy and Clariom microarray analysis. ed a homozygous missense mutation, afore identi ed on chromosome 5 (LOD score of 3.1). In the Syrian patient (identi ed through Gene- Matcher), clinical WES revealed another missense mutationin the same gene, NM_018928.2:c.1463C>T:p.Ala488Val. Together with its isoforms, PCDHGC4 is expressed on the surface of neuronal cells in different combinations, therebyproviding cells with a unique \"barcode \"for self/non self- discrimination. PCDHGC4 is a highly conserved Ca +2 binding protein and in silico analyses predicted both variants to decrease its Ca+2afnity, which most likely impairs its function. We also observed endogenous and transiently overexpressed blebbing of the nuclear envelope, micronuclei, misshapen nuclei and higher apoptotic rates were observed. Arraytranscriptome analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in cadherin signaling. Conclusions: Ourndings indicate that PCDHGC4 is a novel MCPH gene, and its optimal function seems to be an indispensable requirement for the development of a proper brain structure. M. Iqbal: None.

Mutations in MCT8 (SLC16A2 gene on Xq13.2) cause Allan-Herndon- Dudley syndrome(AHDS), characterized by severe neuro- cognitive impairment and abnormal thyroid function (lowserum T4, high T3 levels). Methods: Male subjects clinically suggestive of AHDS underwent thyroid function testing(particularly T3),SLC16A2 analysis, or WES. Results: We report 7 individuals from 5 families,3 were siblings. All boys startled easily and showed progressivehypotonia by 3-6 months-old. Key unifying features included severe motor and intellectual disability, axial hypotonia, progressive spasticity, microcephaly, failure tothrive. Limb dystonia was a dominant feature, and 3 demonstrated paroxysmal movements. Two had seizures/ abnormal EEG, one had sleep myoclonus. MRI brainshowed delayed myelination with progression in 4 boys. TFT revealed high serum T3, low T4 and normal TSH pathogenic inSLC16A2 (3 frameshift,1 missense) were 4unrelated The fth variant(c.698G>T) was classi ed VUS but in-silico analyses suggest it disease- causing, and patient showed clinical and biochemical correlation. Four mothers were carriers. Upon diagnosis, L-thyroxine in 3 individuals was ceased as not to furtherexacerbate the high T3 and resulting hypermetabolism. Conclusions: We wish to highlight the combination of clinical features and abnormal TFT unique to MCT8deciency in prompting early diagnosis, as disease conrmation not only directs accurate genetic counselling and reproductive options, but also offers therapeutic hope asongoing clinical trials suggest encouraging response to T3 analogue Triac as a potential therapy.

We sought to expand our knowledge of the phenotypic spectrum ofMCPH15 and demonstrate the underlying mechanism of inactivation of the MFSD2A transporter. Materials and Methods: We carried out detailed analysis of the clinical and neuroradiological features of eight individuals from seven consanguineous families with severe microcephaly. Genetic investigation was performed throughexome sequencing. Structural insights on the human Mfsd2a model and in vitro biochemical assays were used to investigate the functional impact of the identi ed variants. Results: All patients had primary microcephaly and severe developmental delay. Brain MRI showed variabledegrees of white matter reduction, recurrent variants p.(Thr198Met) and p.(Thr159Met), all resulting in either reduced MFSD2A expression and/or transport activity. Conclusions: Our study further delineates the phenotypic spectrum of MCPH15, re ning its clinical and neuroradio- logical characterization and supporting that MFSD2A deciency causes early prenatal brain developmental disruption. We also show that poor MFSD2A expression despite normal transporter activity is a relevant G. None. H. Alsaif: None. B. Artem: None. S. Riazuddin: None. S. Riazuddin: None. M. Manzini: B.

Res Inst, Sch Medicine, Univ Minho, Braga, Portugal,17Sackler Fac Medicine, Med Cen, Kfar Saba, Israel,19MedStar United States Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) is a neurological disorder caused by an unstable (CAG) ninATXN3 , ranging usually 61-87 repeats in patients. Although MJD is the most frequent dominant ataxia worldwide, our previous studiessuggest that de novo expansions would not explain its worldwide prevalence. To date, only two major MJD mutational origins have been identi ed: the Machado line- age, more recent, most frequent in parts of Portugal; and the ancient Joseph lineage, of Asian origin, spread worldwide. We extended our previous studies and tested the potential ofadditional markers for higher-resolution MJD haplotypes. We analysed a total of 370 families, from 30 world popu- lations (5 continents); assessed a set of 30 SNPs ciswith the (CAG) nexpansion, , to construct net- Joseph ( n=210) and Machado ( n =90 families) pure lineages, we observed 7 sublineages, differing from those two main haplotype backgrounds at 1-3 variants. Based on extended STR-haplotypes, the highestgene diversity was observed in Joseph-lineage families from the USA (0.91 \u00b1 0.05) and Asia (0.88 \u00b1 0.03), followed by central European populations (around 0.50), with Portu-guese families showing the lowest diversity (0.18 \u00b1 0.08). Besides its epidemiological and historical interest, these variants could be of great value to study phenotypic varia-tion and genetic modi ers linked to these haplotypes; to study genetic instability of the (CAG) n; and for ther- apeutical interventions, including best design for allele-speci cATXN3 silen- cing, that might be applicable to most MJD patients.

The CAG repeat length is inversely correlated with the age of onset (AO) but only explains upto 60-70% of AO variation. Thus, additional modi ers of AO need to be identi ed. Whole exome sequencing was performed in 4 early AO and 5 late AO (\u00b110 years devia-tion) patients of a large Dutch MJD/SCA3 family (n affec- ted_total=32) via Illumina HiSeq. Sequencing bioinformatics pipeline and Alissa(Agilent). ATXN3 protein aggregates were quanti using alter-trap identi ed a rare non-synonymous variant c.472G>C, p.Gly158Arg in the highly conservedmethyltransferase domain of NSUN5 in the late AO cases but not in the cases with early AO. NSUN5 was previously shown to regulate lifespan and stress resistance in yeast,worms, and flies. Upon screening of all 32 affected family members, we identi ed 8 cases carrying the p.Gly158Arg variant, who showed an average delay in AO (7.9 \u00b1 4.8years) compared to non-carriers. Upon silencing of NSUN5 in HEK293T cells transiently expressing ATXN3-148Q increased protein aggregates were observed compared tocontrol. Our preliminary results point to NSUN5 as likely modi er gene of AO in MJD/SCA3. Further studies are needed toconrm if the p.Gly158Arg variant changes NSUN5 's modifying role on ATXN3 protein aggregation and toxicity.

MPAN is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the C19orf12 gene and is considered the third most common clinical form of neurodegenerationwith brain iron accumulation. Nevertheless, only few patient cohorts were described and MPAN clinical and genetic diversity is of great interest. Material and methods: For cohort formation, we analyzed the internal database in Research Centre for Medical Genetics in Moscow and several commercialgenetic laboratories. Patients were examined by a clinical geneticist and gave their inform consent to participate in the study. Mutation analysis was performed by whole exomesequencing or by Sanger sequencing of C19orf12 gene. Functional analysis of c.193 +5G>A variant was performed using a minigene assay. Disease prevalence was calculatedwith the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Allelic imbalance was detected using RT-PCR. Results: We gathered a cohort of 17 con rmed MPAN patients with detailed clinical information. The common c.210_214del variant accounted for 73,5% of all the pathogenic alleles. We detected four previously undescribedvariants and several patient with an unusual clinical presentation. The estimated MPAN prevalence wasAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 4031:600000. In one heterozygous carrier, a pronounced allelic imbalance with lower expression levels of the wild-type allele was detected.

P09.100.B A recurrent de novo CAPRIN1 mutation causes a novel progressive early onset neurodegenerative disorder Delle of Human Genetics, Cologne, Germany,2Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany, 3Institute for Genetics, Cologne, Germany,4Department of Neurosciences, Ospedale Pediatrico Division, University Ger- many Introduction: Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) repre- sent increasingly prevalent and severely debilitating dis- eases. In several cases, their molecular diagnosis remainselusive. Materials and methods: Trio-based WES and Sanger sequencing led to the identi cation of the disease-causative variant. Its functional impact is being investigated in HEK293T cells and iPSCs. Results: We describe two individuals from two unrelated non-consanguineous families with an identical de novo mutation in CAPRIN1 (Cell Cycle Associated Protein 1): an 8 year-old girl with progressive muscular atrophy, whodeveloped ataxia and cognitive decline at 11 years, and a 7 year-old boy with spinocerebellar ataxia and learning difculties. Both carry an identical de novo c.1535C>T variant (p.Pro512Leu) which is not reported in gnomAD and affects a highly conserved residue. CAPRIN1 isabundant in the brain, where it regulates the transport and translation of mRNAs of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. As other ND-related proteins, it is a component of stress granules and harbours a prion-like domain (PRD). In accordance with the in silico predictions suggesting that the p.P512L mutation increases its aggregation propensity,CAPRIN1 P512Loverexpression causes the formation of insoluble aggregates in transfected HEK293T cells. To investigate the mutation effects in neurons, we successfullyintroduced the missense mutation in human iPSCs using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CAPRIN1 P512Lis prone to aggregation. As CAPRIN1 de ciency is linked to autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) in humans, we identify CAPRIN1 as a novel gene implicated in NDs, and a novel class of mutations perturbing CAPRIN1 function in a dominant manner.

P09.101.C Implementation of WES-based gene panel testing in patients with adult-onset neurological disorders at theUniversity Hospital of Ghent: a retrospective observa- tional analysis of Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium,2Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Belgium,4Department of Head and Skin, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium Introduction: Neurodegenerative inherited diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. A molecular diagnosis is elementary for genetic counseling and potentialtherapeutic strategies. In January 2019 6 novel WES-based gene panels were introduced at the Ghent University Hos- pital to facilitate diagnostics in patients with neurodegen-erative diseases. In this study we want to establish the added value of these panels and de ne patient- and disease- specic characteristics associated with a high diagnostic yield.404 J. del PicchiaMethods: 6 novel gene panels were introduced in diagnostic setting at the Centre for Medical Genetics Ghent: 1. Ataxia/spasticity 2. Leukodystrophy 3. Paroxysmal/ episodic disorders 4. Movement disorders 5. Neurodegen- eration with brain iron accumulation 6. Progressive myoclonic epilepsy Results: From January the 1stup till December 31st2019 176 cases have been analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 50 years with a majority of the patients being adults(98%). The leukodystrophy panel was most popular (43%), followed by the ataxia/spasticity panel (26%) and the movement disorders panel (20%). The overall diagnosticyield was 15%. In another 15% variants of unknown signicance were found. The diagnostic yield was highest among patients presenting with spinocerebellar ataxia(30%). The causal mutations were missense (10%) and deletion (3%) mutations. Conclusions: Gene panel testing is a successful tool to diagnose inherited neurological diseases. The overall diagnostic yield after analysis of 176 cases was 15%, withanother 15% of potential but unsure diagnoses. Patients suffering from ataxia and/or spastic paraplegia were most likely to obtain a molecular diagnosis (30%). N. Schuermans: None. E. Debackere: None. S. Symoens: None. B. Poppe: None. P.

Microcephaly, progressive cortical atrophy, cerebellar hypoplasia and delayed myeli- nation are neurological in affected individuals. NMIHBA is caused by biallelic variants in PRUNE1 encoding prune exopolyphosphatase 1. We provide in-depthclinical description of two affected siblings harboring compound heterozygous c.383G>A (p. Arg128Gln), c.520G>T (p.Gly174*) in and provideevidence that they result in the destabilization of protein structure and/or loss of exopolyphosphatase activity. Genetic ablation of Prune1 results in midgestational leth- ality in mice, associated with perturbations to embryonic growth and vascular development. Our ndings suggest that NMIHBA results from hypomorphic variant alleles inhumans and underscore the potential key role of PRUNE1 exopolyphoshatase activity in neurodevelopment. H. Nistala: A.

Houlden1 of London, United Background: Neurodevelopmental char- acterized by high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Their molecular basis had not been well characterized inBangladesh. Through the Synaptopathies and Paroxysmal Syndromes (SYNaPS) Study Group, we aimed to elucidate the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders affecting the Bangladeshi patients. Methods: We applied whole exome sequencing (WES) in a cohort of 50 Bangladeshi families with primarilyMendelian neurodevelopmental diseases. In families with- out likely pathogenic variants in known disease causing genes; novel candidate genes were prioritized according tofunctional impact, rarity in multiple databases especially in Southeast Asia population, presence in multiple families with overlapping phenotypes, mutational tolerance of thegene, animal studies, predicted deleteriousness by several in silico tools and expression of the protein in affected tissues. Results: We found known pathogenic or novel variants in known disease genes with phenotypic expansion in 18 families and 12 novel candidates in 10 families including RTN4R ,ITGB8 andACBD6 . Overall, molecular diagnosis was provided by variants in known genes in 36 families (72%) and by novel candidate genes in additional 10 families, resulting in a potential molecular diagnostic rate of92%. Homozygous variants were causative in only 34.7%, despite high rate of consanguinity in our cohort. Conclusions: Our study shows the bene ts of WES analysis in neurodevelopmental disorders in non-European populations and highlights ongoing dif culties in variant interpretation. In our cohort, only six of identi ed variants were previously reported, the remaining were novel variants and hence interpretation of pathogenicity was challenging especially in cases with atypical phenotypes.

The goal is to utilize BTS to lower the age of CLN2 disease diagnosis. Eligibility criteria were: age-at-test-order between 24-60 months and unprovoked seizure onset >24 months. BTSuses an epilepsy gene panel of 180 +genes with the option to include preliminarily associated genes. Non-BTS epilepsy gene panel testing, which includes no limitation for age-at-test-order and age-of-seizure-onset, has shown a 15.5% ( cally involving TPP1 gene (CLN2 disease). Within program, the overall MDx was 6.74% ( n=46/682). However, the yield of TPP1 was 0.88%, representing a 17.6-fold increase incomparison to non-BTS cohort. Age of CLN2 disease diagnosis was earlier than as described in the literature (3.89-year versus 5-year). CLN2 disease was not asuspected diagnosis for 5 out of 6 individuals tested using BTS. Other genes that contributed to positive molecular diagnoses in the BTS program earlier CLN2 disease identi cation. These ndings indicate that broad epilepsy gene panel tests can increase diagnostic yield for CLN2 disease and simultaneously identify other genetic causes of epilepsy. S. Aradhya: A.

ADHD traits were associated with increased deletion burden ( p=0.014), whereas there was an increased burden of duplication for SSRT ( p=0.034). We found no global CNV burden for OCD traits. ADHD traits showedsignicant enrichment for deletions in genes associated with mouse neurophenotypes ( p=0.009) and with human brain gene expression ( p=0.04). OCD and SSRT traits showed enrichment for duplications in genes expressed in human brain ( p=0.004 and 0.016, respectively). SSRT traits showed 1q42.3, 2q37.3, 9q22.2, 12q13.13, 18p11.21, and 22q11.21.

Theworldwide prevalence of CADASIL has been estimated at approximately 5:100,000. Methods: Total coding region of the NOTCH3 gene was analyzed with Sanger or NGS sequencing in 650 patients (359 male, 291 female; mean age 45.27 \u00b1 15.95 years) with the MRI sign of small vessel disease. In our cohort nongenetic risk factors for cerebovascular disorders have been excluded.Results: Damaging variants has ben in found in 7.84% of the cases, in 51 patiens 16 missense substitutions were found in the NOTCH3 gene. Twelve have been previously described as G420C, R133C, R207C). These variants were not present in controls and were predicted as disease causing by in silico analysis. Conclusions: In the Hungarian cohort the most common rare variant was the R90C NOTCH3 gene, the mutation frequency was, 2.5%. In the Caucasian population thisvariant is the most frequent pathogenic variant. We detected rare variants characteristic of Asian population as well (R133C). We can conclude that the henetic epidemiologicaldata of the Hungarian pateints with CADASIL can be explained by the Hungarian history.

We report six individuals from four families with biallelic variants in NRROS . All affected individuals had refractory epilepsy, developmental regression, and reduced white matter volume with delayed myelination. Intracranial calcication was detected in three individuals. These fea- tures are consistent with those observed in the Nrros knockout mouse. Methods: Confocal microscopy in HEK293T cells was used to investigate the localisation of wild-type and mutantNRROS proteins. Flow cytometry was performed to analyse the in fluence of mutant NRROS proteins in anchoring latent TGF- 1 to the cell surface. Results: Wild-type and mutant NRROS proteins were found to co-localise with latent TGF- 1 intracellularly. However, flow cytometry showed that the mutant NRROS proteins failed to anchor latent TGF- 1 on the cell surface, as compared to wild-type NRROS. Moreover, wild-type NRROS rescued the defect of the disease-associatedmutants in presenting latent TGF- 1 to the cell surface. Conclusion: Ourndings suggest that loss of NRROS function causes a severe childhood-onset neurodegenerativecondition with features suggestive of a disordered response to inflammation.

Kyoto, Japan,3Kobe Children 's Hospital, Hyogo, Japan,4Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan Introduction: N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) plays a critical role in intracellular transport, whichis essential for neurotransmitter release. Dysregulation of neurotransmitter releasing process has been recognized as the mechanistic basis for neurological disorders. Here, we describe two patients with de novo pathogenic variants in NSF with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Clinical Report: Patient 1 was a girl with no signi cant family medical history. She was born at 37 weeks of gestation by uneventful delivery after an uneventful pregnancy. Immediately after birth, she developed contin-uous tonic seizures. Electroencephalography showed burst- suppression patterns. Patient 2 was a 1-year-old girl with no signicant family medical history. In her prenatal period, she exhibited failure to thrive, fetal hydrops, and anemia. After birth, she had no spontaneous respiration, which required mechanical ventilation, and had frequent myoclo-nic seizures. Her electroencephalography showed burst- suppression patterns. Results: Trio-based exome sequencing revealed de novo heterozygous variant (NM_006178.3) in both the in patient 2. Functional analysis: When ectopically expressed in the developing eye of Drosophila in the presence of normal fly protein, the mutant human NSF protein severely affected eye development, while the wild-type human protein had no detectable effect under the same conditions. This nding suggested that the two variants had a dominant negative effect. Conclusions: De novo heterozygous mutations in the NSF cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy.

It is upregulated during human embryonic brain development and has low expression afterbirth. Homozygous KO mice are lethal. A recurrent mis- sense variant was reported in patients with Schuurs- Hoeijmakers syndrome (OMIM 615009), an autosomaldominant disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinct craniofacial features, and variable additional con- genital abnormalities. Seizures of various types are frequentand usually respond well to antiepileptic drugs. This variant was suggested to act via a dominant-negative or a gain-of- function mechanism. No other pathogenic variant has beenreported to date. We report on four patients from three unrelated families, with homozygous variants of PACS1 . They presented with severe developmental delay, poor eyecontact, absent language. Seizures started in infancy. They were of various types (focal seizures in one patient, spams in another one and generalized seizures in three patients)and drug resistant. EEG showed multifocal spikes or gen- eralized sharp waves. Brain MRI showed variable patterns in patients, including delayed myelination or cerebral atro-phy. Patients did not show the dysmorphic features remi- niscent of Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome. One family carried a homozygous stop variant and the two others dif-ferent unreported homozygous missense variants, affecting highly conserved amino acids. These variants were absent or with a very low occurrence in the gnomAD v2.1 data-base. These observations suggest that biallelic variants of PACS1 can cause a phenotype of developmental epileptic encephalopathy. Functional analyses will be performed tocharacterize the consequences of these variants. N. Chatron: None. A. Rad: None. S. Efthymiou: None. A. Labalme: None. B. Vona: None. M. Carneiro: None. K.

The underlying mechanism of mitochon- drial processes in the sporadic form of PD is still largelyunknown. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) gather the total risk for disease in an individual based on common variants, where the risk alleles and their effects are de ned by pre- vious genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we evaluate whether an additive genetic risk of variants from gene-sets is associated with increased PD risk. Material and Methods: A Luxembourgish cohort of 656 controls and 633 PD patients were genotyped on the Neurochip array. PRS for each individual were calculatedwith PRSice-2, using the GWAS data from Nalls et al., 2018. The PRS was tested for association with PD status with mitochondrial and other pathway-related gene-sets.The Parkinson 's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset included 363 PD cases and 165 controls genotyped with NeuroX chip. Results: The results show a signi cantly higher common variant burden in PD cases compared to controls in mitochondrial with within the known PD genes, lysosomal and autophagy gene-sets. The same resultwas observed with the (PPMI) data. Conclusions: Our study suggests that cumulative effect of common variants in mitochondrial genes signi cantly contribute to PD. Association tests targeting speci c mitochondrial pathways and functional studies could determine the level of involvement of each mitochondrialprocess in the disease onset and progression. Z.

We now reviewed genetic and clinical data from asequential series with pathogenic variants in PNKP , 2015 through 2019, to update mutational spectrum and reassess phenotypes; we report 10 additional AOA4 patients. Weused Sanger sequencing of PNKP or a NGS multigene (whole-exome based) panel for recessive ataxias, according to clinical request; 10 Portuguese AOA patients (7 families),were found to be homozygotes (2 families) or compound heterozygotes (5 families), c.1029 +2T>C (r.spl) Incidentally, through multigene panels, six other patients with ataxia (or other differential diagnoses) carrieda single pathogenic or likely- pathogenic variant in PNKP . This study expands considerably the number of AOA4 patients genetically characterized by our group, from 11 reported in 2015 to a total of 21. Further, con rms AOA4 as among the most frequent subtypes of recessive ataxia in Portugal. Considering the limited number of patientsreported in the literature so far ( n=8), studies in other populations are much needed. S. Sousa: None. J. Oliveira: None. J. Parente-Freixo: None. I.

Various studies suggestgenetic risk factors for POCD. This prospective cohort study aimed to detect genome-wide associations with POCD in older patients. Methods: Study participants aged 65 years completed a battery of neuropsychological tests consisting of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer 's Disease-Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-NAB), Trail Making Tests A and B, and the Phonemic Fluency Test (S-words) before, and at 1 weekand 3 months after major noncardiac surgery. Test variables were converted into standard scores (z-scores) based on demographic variables. POCD was diagnosed if the declinewas >1 standard deviation in 2 or more of the 15 variables in the test battery. A genome-wide association studyAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 411(GWAS) was performed to determine potential that are linked to the phenotype POCD. Results: Sixty-three patients with blood samples were included in the study. POCD was diagnosed in 47.6% of patients at 1 week and in 34.2% of patients at 3 months after surgery. Insuf cient sample quality led to exclusion of 26 patients. In the remaining 37 patients, a GWAS was performed, but no association with POCD was found. A subsequent gene set analysis on 36 genes using VEGAS2did not reveal any signi cant associations. Conclusions: In this patient cohort, a GWAS did not reveal an association between speci c genetic alleles and POCD at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Future genetic analysis should focus on speci c candidate genes for POCD. N. G\u00f6ttel: None. M. Rickenbacher: None. C.S. Reinbold: None. P. None. A.U. Monsch: None. L.A. Steiner: None.

Material and methods: We performed exome sequen- cing in a family with ataxia. To interpret pathogenicity of aPOLG2 variant, we used deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, tested for mitochondrial deletions; and established primary broblast lines from two mutation carriers to investigate mitochondrial integrity by immuno- cytochemistry, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry. Results: The index patient, a 55-year-old woman, presented with signs of vertigo at 30 years, followed by the development of cerebellar ataxia and progressive ophthalmoplegia. Her brother and mother had onset ofataxia at ages of 40 and 50 years. By exome sequencing, we identi [p.Ser424Pro], NM_007215.3) inPOLG2 in all three affected family members. Initially, this was a variant of uncertain signi cance (VUS). We found a higher number of mtDNA sequence changes in blood cellsfrom the mutation carriers compared to matched healthy controls. However, large mtDNA deletions were notdetected in the blood samples. In POLG2 -mutant bro- blasts, we demonstrated an impaired mitochondrial net- work, a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased TOMM20 protein levels in comparison to healthy controls. A muscular biopsy was not available. Conclusions: We provide multiple lines of evidence that thisPOLG2 variant is associated with impaired mitochon- drial integrity suggesting its pathogenicity in respect to the mitochondrial phenotype (ataxia and progressive externalophthalmoplegia) in this family.

K. of NEDHIB (neu- rodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia and variable intellectual and behavioral impairment) in a girl withmultiple anomalies and a de novo frameshift mutation in POLR2A . J. Behunova , F. Laccone Institute of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria The gene POLR2A is coding polymerase II, RNA, subunit A and its heterozygous mutations have been described to cause global developmental delay with hypotonia, abnormal behaviour, feeding and visual problems, strabismus, vari-able craniofacial dysmorphic features, frequent infections, and, eventually, structural brain anomalies. To date only 16 patients with POLR2A mutations have been described in a single publication, three of them carrying a truncating mutation. Many features in the published patients are overlapping with those of our patient. However, none of thepatients reported presented a polydactyly (in our girl pre- axial with a double thumb on the left), a thumb hypoplasia (in our girl just a soft tissue thumb \", which had been removed, on the right), anal anteposition and stenosis, and a heart defect (ASDII). There was signi cant neonatal hypotonia. Unsupported walking was possible only at theage of 4 years. Developmental delay now at the age of 14 years is severe. The girl does not speak at all. After the rst decade the tendon-re flexes of the legs decreased and bilat- eral pes cavus developed, possibly manifesting a peripheral neuropathy. There are craniofacial features, but no microcephaly. Whole exome sequencing (incl. CNV)identi ed a 2 bp deletion in POLR2A which is supposed to cause a frameshift and a premature stop of protein synthesis.412 J. del PicchiaNo other DNA variants were identi ed that could explain the symptoms unusual for NEDHIB.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are used for identifying the geneticarchitecture of complex diseases in order to predict disease genetic risk, as well as testing their shared genetic archi- tecture. In this study, we investigated the associationbetween PRS related to neurodegenerative and complex diseases and brain morphometry. A total of 479 cognitively unimpaired middle-age participants at increased risk of AD(ALFA cohort) with available genotyping and neuroima- ging data were included. PRS were calculated from the most recent genome-wide association meta-analyses for Alzhei-mer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease, stroke, hyperten- sion, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, depression, cerebrovascular disease, and CSF core AD biomarkers.Association analyses included brain regional volumes as outcomes. Associations were estimated using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE - 4 status, and total intracranial volume. We found increased PRS average of AD, p-tau and A 42 levels among ALFA participants. Furthermore, results suggested evidence of anassociation between increased risk of cholesterolemia andreduced volumes of left accumbens area, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and reduced volumes of thalamus proper, as well as increased risk of having higher p-tau levels and reduced volumes of right thalamus proper and right cerebellum cortex. We provide strong evidence that genetic liability of cardiovascular diseases and core ADbiomarkers in fluences brain morphology in ALFA partici- pants. In addition, across all diseases, ALFA participants showed increased genetic risk of AD and altered CSFbiomarker. N. Vilor-Tejedor: None. R. Guigo: None. G. Operto: None. M. Crous-Bou: None. R.

Labalme 1, L. of Saint Etienne, Saint Etienne, France,3Fol- kh\u00e4lsan Research Center, Helsinki, Finland,4Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Brescia, Brescia, Italy,6University Hospital of Saint- Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France,7Epilepsy Research University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Purpose: Progressive myoclonus epilepsies are a geneti- cally heterogeneous group of rare Mendelian disorders dened by the combination of action and re flex myoclonus, other types of epileptic seizures, and progressive neuro-cognitive impairment. In addition to the classical diseases, namely Unverricht-Lundborg and Lafora, several other genetic forms have been identi ed during the past years. Despite recent advances, a substantial proportion of cases remain without a molecular diagnosis and additional genes still remain to be identi ed. Methods: Individuals from two families from different ethnic backgrounds with several individuals affected with a similar presentation of progressive myoclonus epilepsyresembling Unverricht-Lundborg disease were analyzed by exome sequencing. Results: Affected individuals from both families were homozygous for the same p.(Gln64Arg) variant affecting a splice site in SLC7A6OS . It occurs 7 times in gnomAD as a heterozygote, and is absent as a homozygote. Haplotypeanalysis suggests the variant arose independently in the two families. Analysis of cDNA from lymphoblastoid cells of a patient showed a partial abolition of the splice site and thecreation of an abnormal isoform with the retention of intron 1 (NM_032178.2:r.191_193ins[ag;192 +1_193-1]). RT-qPCR and western blot showed a 80% reduction of cDNA and 60% of protein. Gene knockdown experiments in zebra sh indicate that slc7a6os plays a critical role in dened areas of the developing CNS. Conclusions: Our results suggest that SLC7A6OS may be a novel gene causing progressive myoclonus epilepsyphenotype resembling Unverricht-Lundborg disease. A. Labalme: None. L. M. Muona: None. B.

Lesca: P09.128.C The Paczkowska , M. Geremek, Nowakowska Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, PolandThe RBFOX1 gene encodes a protein that regulates pre- mRNA splicing in developmental genes expressed inmuscle, heart and neuronal cells. Intragenic deletions of RBFOX1 gene have been identi ed as susceptibility loci and reported in patients with aggressive behavior, conductdisorder, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder. Despite of the documented correlation with neurodevelopmental dis- orders, the deletions of RBFOX1 gene are often inherited from the healthy parents, therefore the clinical interpretation of CNVs within this gene is still unclear. We applied oli- gonucleotide microarrays (OGT) in a cohort of 9430patients with neurodevelopment disorders and their healthy relatives. The analyses of genomes were performed using genome-wide array to accurate detection of copy numbervariation at the exon level in RBFOX1 gene. Chromosomal analysis revealed intragenic RBFOX1 deletions in 36 patients. The differential distribution across the genebetween patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and the control group allowed to distinguished evidently pathogenic areas within the gene. Deletions of exones 1-2and 13-14 have high penetrance, and are mainly associated with conduct disorder and autism spectrum disorder. While the middle part of the gene and all intronic CNVS wereobserved with higher frequency in the control group, sug- gesting their benign impact on the phenotype.

Patients typically present with an urge to move the legs at rest at night which severely impairs sleep and quality oflife. Based on previous GWAS results, we performed mutational load analysis of putatively causal candidate genes. Materials and Methods: We sequenced exons and promotors of 84 genes in 4,649 RLS patients and 4,982 population-based controls from Germany in a targeted NGSapproach with 11,214 molecular inversion probes (MIPs). We compared the variant load (MAF < =0.05) by genebetween cases and controls using standard burden testing. As variants in a MIP 's binding regions affect its sequencing yield, we also analyzed target sequencing depths as an integrative and independent assessment of the differential variant burden. Results: Differential variant burden results of both types of analysis overlapped signi cantly. Therefore, 14 genes were signi cantly associated and validated. Both types of analysis also converged signi cantly in ne-mapping potentially causative domains within these genes. Conclusions: By assessing differential burden with intragenic low-frequency variants we identi ed at least 14 putatively causative genes in RLS. In keeping with other polygenic diseases, the variant burden was higher in patients. Methodologically, we demonstrate that targetdepth analysis is useful for independent validation of conventional variant-based burden tests. Acknowledgements: DFG (project 310572679), RLS e.

P09.131.C Extension of the phenotypes caused by RNF13 variants to include a choreo-dystonic movement Switzerland,2Pediatric Neurology, Geneva Uni- versity Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland The substantial recent advances in genetic diagnosis, have identi ed numerous pathogenic variants on genes involved in neurodevelopment in patients with developmental delayand epilepsy. Among those, heterozygous missense gain-of- function variants in RNF13 leading to altered signaling of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, have beenrecently reported in three children with congenital micro- cephaly, encephalopathy with epilepsy, blindness, and failure to thrive (PMID 30595371). None of these patientspresented with movement disorders. We here report a child with early-onset global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, failure-to-thrive, infantile spasms, focal sei-zures and gastrointestinal dysfunction, who also presented at 3 years with a choreo-dystonic movement disorder. AnAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 415extended metabolic work-up was normal. Brain MRI did not reveal signi cant abnormalities. A trio whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous de novo c.932delT:(p. Leu311TyrfsTer2) variant in the RNF13 gene. The variant results in a frameshift near the carboxyl terminus of the predicted protein sequence (codon 311 of 380), producingan abnormal protein with a postulated gain of function effect. Interestingly the previously described pathogenic variants were in the same location of the primary proteinsequence p.(Leu311Ser) and p.(Leu312Pro).To our knowl- edge, our patient is the fourth described so far. In addition to previously reported symptoms, the phenotype of this childalso included a choreo-dystonic movement disorder; thus the phenotypes related to RNF13 pathogenic variants are extended to include a movement disorder. The RNF13 should be added to the panel of candidate genes in patients with abnormal movements, in addition to those involved in encephalopathy and early-onset epilepsy. E. Ranza: None. X.

P09.136.B DNMT1 overexpression results in dysregulation of multiple In the context of DNMT1 overexpression as one of the etiological factors for schizophrenia (SZ), and abnormal neurogenesis associated with Dnmt1Tet/Tet(Tet/Tet) mouse embryonic stem cells, we studied the effects of DNMT1overexpression on neurogenesis. Transcriptome analysis of Tet/Tet neurons showed dysregulation of a signi cant number of genes associated with neurological disorders.Downregulation of Shhwas the main event associated with dysregulation of genes involved in multiple pathways such asWnt1 andWnt3a signaling, extracellular matrix synthesis, homeobox family and other transcription factors required for brain development. Transcriptome analysis of Tet/Tet ES cells to understand earlier events also showeddysregulation of a signi cant number of genes associated with neurodevelopment and neurological disorders. Speci- cally, Bmp4 , an antagonistic molecule to Shh, emerged with the highest number of interacting partners. In ES cells, high Bmp4 transcript levels were associated with low transcript levels of Lrp2 ,Htra1 and Bmper (negativeregulators of Bmp4 ) and Dpysl2 (negatively regulated by BMP4). Consequently, as in case of some SZ-patient derived iPS cells, Tet/Tet ES cells possessed a decreased potential to produce neurons and oligodendrocytes but an increased potential in forming glial cells. RRBS data on ESCs and neurons did not reveal any signi cant difference in the level of DNA methylation of the promoters of the affected genes. DNMT1 affects on these genes therefore, appear to be independent of catalytic activity. Takentogether, increased DNMT1 levels results in abnormal neurogenesis by affecting multiple SZ-associated genes and pathways in a DNA-methylation independent manner. S. Saxena: None. S.

Genotype-phenotype correlation is unclear, though some variants have been associated mainly with spastic ataxia and others with WRS. Methods: Phenotypic analysis and exome sequencing were performed in 4 affected siblings, two healthy siblings and their mother. Results: All affected siblings (two men, two women; ages 45-58) had early childhood-onset hypodontia They biallelic POLR3A pathogenic variants. The mother was heterozygo- tous and both healthy siblings had wild-type alleles. Each mutated allele had two intronic splicing-altering variants in cis, leading to skipping of exons 14 and 26. This allele was reported previously in compound heterozygous combina-tions in patients with severe progeroid WRS. Conclusions: This is the rst report addressing the clinical consequence associated with a unique homozygouspathogenic allele in the POLR3A gene. Our ndings indicate that for this pathogenic allele causes spastic with hypodontia, rather than a progeroidsyndrome, dysmorphism or hypogonadism previously attributed to this allele when found in a compound heterozygous state with other alleles. Our ndings con- tribute to the characterization of genotype-phenotype correlation in POLR3A -related disorders. A. Felner: None. A. Lossos: None. E. Kogan: None. Z. Argov: None. C.

Genetics, Medical University Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria,2Psychiatric ward for active treatment, State Phsychiatry Hospital Pazardzhik,, Plovdiv, Bulgaria Introduction: Speci c Language Impairment (SLI) is a disorder characterized by slow, abnormal language devel- opment, despite normal intelligence, adequate social environment and in the absence of any explanatory medicalconditions. Most children with this disorder do not present any other cognitive or neurological de cits and have normal non-verbal IQ. This condition is highly heritable and affectsbetween 5% and 8% of pre-school children. Lately inves- tigations have begun to uncover genetic factors that may contribute to susceptibility to language impairment. In ourprevious study we conducted a pool expression analysis and GINS2 was the most up regulated gene. Materials and Methods: The study aimed to examine the individual expression pro le of GINS2 gene by ddPCR inthe peripheral blood of 48 individuals divided into two groups: children with SLI and healthy controls. Results: Mean values of 15,4copies/20mcl was found in the SLI group and 8,8 - in the control one. The difference was statistically signi cant - P =0.03, proving that the GINS2 gene is up regulated in the SLI group. GINS2,located in 16q21 is part of the GINS complex which plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication, and progression of DNA replication forks. There are a couple ofcase reports that report speech delay in patients with 16q21 duplications. A recent study found a connection with GINS2 expression and neuroin flamation. Conclusions: Comparative gene expression analysis is useful in discovering novel genetic markers associated with SLI. Elevated gene expression of GINS2 might contribute to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of SLI. I.G. Sotkova-Ivanova: None. H. Ivanov: None. A. Linev: None. T. Vachev: None. N. Popov: None. I.

M\u00fcller-Hofstede, S. Ledig, J. Horvath, P. Wieacker, A. Bohring, A. transmission spinoc erebellar ataxia (SCAX) is missense ATP2B3 resulting in spinocerebellar a taxia 1 (SCAX1) is reported twice in the literature as the cause of SCAX1 in two families. The ATP2B3 gene encodes for a member of the calmodulin-activated plasma membrane Ca 2+ATPase family (PMCA3) which extrudes excess calcium from the cell to maintain neuronal Ca2+-homeostasis, especially in the cerebellum. The 46 year old index patient was referred to our institute because of early onset cerebellar ataxia. He showed a delayed motor development as an infant,impaired gross and ne motor skills, dysarthria, and hypoplasia of the cerebellum. Intellectual development was normal. Kennedy 'sd i s e a s ew a se x c l u d e da n daN G S panel for ataxia related genes showed no pathogenic variants. Array-CGH revealed a duplication of 357 kb in Xq28. This duplication spans eight genes, includingATP2B3 and two more OMIM genes (BGN, FAM38A). Further analysis of female family members con rmed this duplication in the patient 's mother, her sister and the sister 's daughter. Her three year old son also displayedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 417ataxia and a delayed motor development. He was proved to carry the duplication as well. Based on the family constellation and the known literature for the ATP2B3 gene we highly assume that the duplication in Xq28 comprising ATP2B3 is causative for the spinocerebellar within family, implicating a dysregulation ofthe calcium homeostasis in neuronal cells by the dupli- of the ATP2B3 gene.

Mohammadpour2 1Islamic Azad university-Tehran medical sciences branch, Iran, Islamic Republic of,2University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran, Rasht, Iran, Islamic Republic of Suicide is a major public health problem, with almost one million people victims 'world-wide each year. Psychologi- cal risk factors for suicidal behaviors are including, psy- chiatric and medical illness, impulsivity, aggression, alcohol and drug abuse specially stimulants, and low stress resi-lience. Genetic risk factors of suicide are not completely claried. Our study aimed to detect genetic risk factors that increasing the vulnerability to committing suicide. DNAwas extracted from blood samples of 8240 saved suicide victims with at least one attempt to suicide in last 12 months that were suffering from psychosis and 5000 healthy sub-jects. Genotyping for the subjects was performed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affy- metrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer 's protocol. Several SNPs were detected with genome-wide signicance. The signi cant association found in 77 SNPs involved in dopaminergic pathway and neurodevelopmentof CNS. 56 of signi cantly related SNPs were found as risk factors of psychiatric disorders specially schizophrenia; other 21 SNPs were related to the mitochondrial complexes,transcription factors and growth factor genes. The study showed strong genetic bases of suicidal thoughts and could be used for providing genetic prognostic markers for pre-diction of suicide risk especially in subjects with psychosis. Also importance of mitochondrial complexes and growth factors in neuorobilogical functions and decision makingprocesses of brain were showed. A. Haghighatfard: None. F.

TAF1 (TATA-box binding protein associated factor 1) codingregion have been shown to cause a complex X-linked neurodevelopmental syndrome that includes intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and neurological manifes-tations. The changes described to date are predominantly missense and distributed along the entire gene. A non- coding TAF1 variant causes X-linked dystonia-parkinson- ism (XDP), disorder. Patients Methods: By whole-exome sequencing, the genetic cause of X-linked intellectual disability was investigated in male patients from two families. In other available family members, the presence of relevant TAF1 variants was investigated by targeted Sanger sequencing. Where appropriate, a standard X-chromosome inactivation assay was used. Results: The proband from Family 1 clinically mani- fested with global developmental delay including motor, speech and cognitive abilities and carried the c.1606G>A(p.(Asp536Asn)) TAF1 variant and the MT-CO1 m.6054G>A (p.(Asp51Asn)) mitochondrial variant in the heteroplasmic state. In Family 2, the affected male patientspresented with early onset spastic paraplegia and mild cognitive impairment, all carrying a missense (c.5418G>C; p.(Glu1806Asp)) variant in TAF1 . Their mother was a heterozygous carrier of the same change and developed adult-onset parkinsonism, spasticity, and dementia. Her X- chromosome inactivation (XCI) was random. Conclusions: Two novel TAF1 variants were identi ed as the likely disease causes in our patients. The affected members of Family 2 presented with pyramidal signs,suggesting that the TAF1 variants other than those related to XDP may cause an affection of additional neurological systems. J.

P09.146.C Brain lipid pro le of early onset Tay-Sachs disease mouse model418 J. del Germany Introduction: Tay-Sachs disease is one of the lysosomal disorders caused by mutation in Hexa gene. HEXA gene deciency affects the central nervous system owing to GM2 accumulation in lysosomes resulting in progressive neuro- degeneration in patient. Previoulsy generated Hexa-/- Neu3-/- mice mimic neuropathological and clinicalabnormalities of early onset Tay-Sachs patients. Lipids are important players in the central nervous system function- ality. Several studies showed that neurodegenerative dis-eases indicate alterations in lipid metabolism. Here, we aimed to clarify the secondary accumulation of lipids and presence of unregulated lipid metabolism in brain of earlyonset Tay-Sachs disease mice model by lipidome pro ling. Materials and methods: Cortex and month-old of and Hexa-/-Neu3-/-mice were analyzed by belongs to glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingoli- In glycerophospholipid class, high level of LPC, LPE and PG lipids while low level of PC, PS lipids weredetected in cortex and hippocampus of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice compared to age matched control group. Signi cantly high levels ceramide and sterolipid were also measured in cortex.Alterations in glycerolipid class was detected in both regions. Conclusion: Here we report that in addition to abnormal GM2 accumulation in lysosomes, secondary but distinct lipid alterations may also contribute to pathophysiology of early onset Tay-Sachs disease suggesting the possibledysfunctionality of cellular pathways such as autophagy.

A. of Technology, Izmir, Turkey Introduction: Tay-Sachs disease is one of the lethal lyso- somal storage disorders caused by mutations on the HEXAgene leading to GM2 accumulation which causes neuro- degeneration. Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice mimic neuropathologic phenotype of the disease. Oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases. In this research we investigated whether the oxidative stress has an effect on theneuropathology mice. Material and Methods: Brain sections and broblasts from WT,Hexa-/- ,Neu3-/- andHexa-/-Neu3-/- mice as well as neuroglia were studied. Oxidative stress markers were analysed by RT-PCR, western blot and protein carbonyla- tion assay. The intracellular ROS level and analysed by FACScan. Results: Signi cant increase in protein carbonyl levels was determined particularly in cerebellum of Hexa-/- Neu3-/- mice. Similarly, we determined signi cant change in neuroglia but not in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- broblast. However, we found signi cantly high level of catalase and Ttase1 mRNA in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- broblasts. In addition, oxidized DCFDA was also increased in Hexa-/-Neu3-/- broblast indicating high level of ROS but surprisingly we detectedthe low level of ROS in neuroglia. Signi cant increase in the level of APE1/Ref-1 protein was observed in cerebellum and thalamus of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- ; however, in broblast there was no signi cant difference among samples. Signi cantly decreased level of catalase and increased Ttase1 mRNA were detected in neuroglia compared tocontrol. abnormal in early-onset Tay-Sachs disease pathology.

Here wereport one patient presenting with central neurological and ophthalmological signs, amyloid deposits on subarachnoidAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 419biopsy and a familial history of neurodegenerative disorder. We identi ed a rare heterozygous TTR mutation c.149T>G, p.(Val50Gly) at the same aminoacid position as the most frequent mutation V50M. In order to understand this unu- sual phenotype, we used bioinformatic tools including structure prediction, estimation of thermodynamic para-meters ( G) to compare models of V50M and V50G mutants, in relation to WT-TTR and applied a molecular modeling method to test the self-assembly capacity of aTTR peptide located in the region of the mutated residue. Our model predicted that the relative stability of tetramers and dimers was not affected by both mutations, Gvalues indicated a moderate instability of V50M monomers whereas V50G showed a very high unfolding capacity. We also investigated theorical models composed of 4 segmentsP11-K35 with a methionine or glycine at position 50. Although in both mutants the structure of each segment consists of a -arch, oligomers were very different. V50M 4-arches were stacked in a parallel -sheet structure sta- bilized by inter-strand interactions whereas 4 -arches of V50G associated in a -barrel structure with intra and inter strand interactions.

The disorder is characterised by multiple hamarto-mas in the brain, heart, skin, and kidney. Another common feature of TSC is epilepsy, which is frequently drug-resistant and constitutes the main cause of morbidity and disability in affected individuals. The project EPIMARKER is aimed to identify new biomarkers of epilepsy in a group of patients affected with TSC. We believe, the results of this research will become a starting point for further work on new therapeutics and clinical solutions. Materials and methods: Therst step of the project was intended to describe an exact molecular cause of TSC in a group of 65 affected individuals. We screened TSC1 and TSC2 genes with the use of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for all exons both genes. Results: Testing with targeted next-generation sequen- cing gene panel revealed pathogenic variants in 50 out of 65 patients, whereas qPCR performed in 15 remainingindividuals showed intragenic deletions in 5 additional cases. Noteworthy, we have found 19 novel and 31 known pathogenic variants. Conclusions: The diagnostic algorithm presented here is a suitable and helpful approach in the molecular analysis of TSC. Furthermore, the data we have obtained will be usedin the further part of the project, which is focused on novel therapeutic strategies.

VASH1 and VASH2, in complex with SVBP, have recently been iden- tied as responsible for intracellular tubulin detyrosination activity. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in SVBP have much recently been described in patients showing intellec- tual disability, microcephaly, ataxia and hypotonia. Methods: All patients underwent accurate clinical evaluation and provided informed consent. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed using patients 'DNA samples, and segregation in relatives was con rmed by Sanger sequencing. Primary broblasts were generated from patients 'skin biopsies, and cultured cells were incubated with paclitaxel to analyze detyrosinated tubulin levels by and blot. cDNA of VASH1 and wild-type/mutated forms of SVBP were cloned into a pCMV-Tag4A vector, and then cotransfected into HeLa cells for Western Blot analysis. Results: We report two families with multiple patients harboring an homozygous missense variant in SVBP (p. Leu49Pro). Affected paraplegia, peripheral neuropathy, verbal apraxia and intellectualdisability, in absence of microcephaly, broadening the previously reported phenotype. In vitro experiments in patients 'broblasts demonstrate a signi cant loss of VASH1/2 detyrosination activity and decreased SVBP levels. Cotransfection studies show that SVBP p.Leu49Pro variant reduces both VASH1 and SVBP soluble quantitiesor stability. Conclusions: Our results expand the of SVBP mutations to complex spastic paraplegiawithout microcephaly, and con rm for the rst time that a detyrosination defect is observed in patients 'cell lines, enabling functional testing of SVBP variants and extended pathogenetic studies.

P09.152.C Another case with childhood-onset Neurodegeneration due to UBTF identi ed novo variant c.628G>A; p.Glu210Lys in the gene UBFT in cases with childhood-onset Neurodegeneration. In these patients,regression of skills occurred at 2.5-7 years. Initially motor regression followed by language regression was found. Brain MRI revealed diffuse cortical atrophy of the sub- cortical white matter. UBFT encodes a transcription factor, which facilitate the assembly of the transcription initiation complex of the RNA polymerase I (PolI), which is crucialfor rRNA synthesis. Functional studies showed that the UBTF variant leads to a stronger binding af nity to the rDNA promotor and increased 18s rRNA As aresult the chromatin structure at the rDNA locus was decondensed. In rats enhanced PolI activity promotes neurite outgrowth, which can lead to neurodegenerativeprocesses (Edvardson et al., 2017). Here we report on another patient carrying the de novo p.Glu210Val UBTF variant identi ed by WES. The psychomotoric development of the boy was slightly delayed at rst. He started walking on his own with 1 \u00bd year, and ataxic gait was noted. At the age of 5 years, he was unable to walk without assistance,and was wheelchair-bound at the age of 7. Subsequently, the boy developed tetraparesis, global retardation, and severe scolio-kyphosis. Around the age of 1 \u00bd the boystarted to use identi able words but his speech deteriorated and by the age of 7 he presented with slurred speech, and subsequently stopped using words. MRI of the brain per-formed at the age of 14 years revealed supratentorial atrophy. D. Zengeler: None. H. Gabriel: None. S. Biskup: None. C. Schell-Apacik: None. P09.154.B Expanding the spectrum of WDR62 mutations : description of new cases L. Ruaud 1,2, S. Drunat3,2, A. Ernault1, Y. HUG, Gen\u00e8ve, Switzerland,Abstracts the Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive Belgium,15Unit of Medical Genetics, Galliera Health Sciences, University of Genova, Genova, Italy,17SYNLAB for Human Primary Hereditary 2), caused by WDR62 mutations, is the second most common form of MCPH. WDR62 , located on chr19q13.12, encodes WD repeat-containing role for mitoticdivision, proliferation of neuronal progenitor and neuronal migration. To date, more 100 patients with pathogenic homozygous or compound heterozygous variants inWDR62 were reported. They have developmental delay with constant speech impairment, moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) and multiple brain malformationsincluding hypoplasia of corpus callosum and migration disorders (polymicrogyria, pachygyria, lissencephaly and schizencephaly). Nevertheless, no patient have been prop-erly assessed by appropriated neuropsychological tests. Using multi-gene panel or exome sequencing, we identi ed 18 cases with WDR62 clinical, neu- ropsychological assessment and neuroradiological pheno- type. Phenotypic spectrum of our patients is very large ranging from severe antenatal presentation leading to pro-found motor handicap, to mild-moderate ID, learning abil- ities and autonomy in daily life. We were surprised to discover that some patients had a VCI at 50 and able to readand write, similar to what is described with ASPM . Some patients had normal brain structure on MRI except micro- cephaly. Interestingly, some patients develop ataxia withage, which was never reported. Epilepsy is not constant but pharmaco-sensitive for all patients unless one. We report here the largest series of WDR62 patients with a very pre- cise clinical, neuropsychological and neuroradiological characterization. We demonstrate that WRD62 mutations do not always cause severe ID/motor handicap and corticalmalformation. However, we have concerns regarding the long term neurological outcome. L. Ruaud: None. S.

Croce1, Telematics of CNR, Pisa, Italy, 3National Research Council Italy, for Biomedi- cal Technologies, (MILANO), Italy,4ALS Piedmont, UPO, Alessandria, Italy Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder with adult onset. Mutation in over 30 genes account for less than 65% of ALS familial cases. To explore ALS missing heritab ility, we performed WGS of 70 ALS/Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) patients nega- tive for mutations in main known causative genes, focusing on a panel of 699 genes implicated in 5 neuro-degenerative disorder s (NDDs, ALS, Parkinson 's disease, FTD, Ataxia and Spastic Paraparesis). We analysed and prioritized mutations in the coding sequence, repeatsexpansions, and structural variants by standard bioinfor- matic tools and we implemented a novel pipeline to prioritize non coding-varia nts with a possible pathoge- n e t i ce f f e c t .W ei d e n t i ed 11 pathogenic variants. Four of them map in genes causative of rare forms of ALS (KIF5A, NEK1, TBK1 OPTN) . The remaining 7 variants map in genes associated with different NDDs and never reported in ALS. Among them, ABCA7, TGM6 and CCDC88C genes associated respectively to Alzheimer disease and autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia. In addition, we found the most common causative mutation of PD in LRRK2 , in an ALS patient with a PD positive family history. Among the non-coding variants, we prioritized 5 deep intronic variants predicting an effect on422 J. del Picchiasplicing mechanism whose functional impact is under investigation with in vitro studies. We found pathogenetic variants in ALS patients in genes involved in other NDDs, reinforcing the idea of a shared genetic cause and a pos- sible overlapping condition between these disorders.

Common genetic risk factors identi ed by GWAS explain 25-38% of the phenotypic variance. It is assumed that rare variants may also play a substantial role andexplain part of the hidden heritability. One strategy to identify such variants is Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of large multiply affected families with BD. In the presentstudy we conducted WGS of 108 individuals in 8 multi- generational affected families of Spanish origin. Methods: Sequencing was performed with 30x mean coverage on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and variant calling was performed using the GATK best practice work flow. For downstream analysis we developed a variant based scoringmodel. We combined information on family structure and the proportion of allele sharing amongst the affected individuals plus the biological impact for each variantbased on different prediction classi ers such as CADD or SNPeff. Results: We focused on the identi cation of rare variants following two WGS data: an \"extended exome \"analysis, focusing on the high impact and protein-coding variants only. Secondly we applied themodel to the full WGS dataset, including also the non- coding part of the genome. On average we identi ed 4.4 million variants per individual. In two families, weidenti ed stop mutations as the top scored variants in the genes TAS2R19 andPPEF2 . Additional top scoring variants were identi ed in the non-coding/intronic regions of the genome.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters S.H.

Haack1, University Hospi- tal, variants in ACTA1 (OMIM *102610) have been associated with a spectrum of rare myopathies. Inheritance is described as autosomal-recessiveas well as autosomal-dominant. The clinical phenotypes can be highly variable regarding age at onset and severity. The severe form of the disorder is characterized by the absenceof spontaneous movement, arthrogryposis, and respiratory failure at birth. Case report: We report on a young woman who presented with a congenital non-progressive muscular disease with unilateral paresis of hypotonia and non-symmetrical muscular atrophy. Aphenotype-based exome analysis showed no causative mutation. During her rst pregnancy a sonogram at 14 weeks of gestation diagnosed severe arthrogryposis ofthe fetus with akinesia of the hips and ulnar deviation of the hands. The pregnancy was terminated. Fetal autopsy documented arthrogryposis multiplex as well as facialdysmorphism, bilateral talipes equinovarus atrophy of muscle bres. with a severe structural (actin) myopathy. Thesubsequent trio exome analysis prioritized heterozygous ACTA1 missense variant (c.226G>C,p. Val118Met) in the fetus. A re-examination of the maternal data revealed a low mosaicism (15%) in the maternal blood sample for the same variant. Conclusions: We postulate that the asymmetric maternal myopathy is caused by a postzygotic mosaic mutation in ACTA1 . The fetus inherited the ACTA1 variant in a then non-mosaic state and developed the severe lethal pheno-type. An analysis of the ACTA1 variant in maternal muscle tissue is intended. U.

P10.02.C Whole exome sequencing reveals a novel homozygous mutation in the ADAM22 gene, underpinning its association with severe neurologic morbidity . L. Sagi-Dain 1, Peleg1 1Carmel Center, Haifa, Israel,2Bnei Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel Background: Numerous genes have been implicated in congenital arthrogryposis and epilepsy. In this report we describe a second reported case of ADAM22 mutations,associated with severe neurologic manifestations. Case presentation: We describe a female infant with congenital arthrogryposis and severe hypotonia includingdiaphragmatic weakness. Intractable seizures appeared in the age of several days, and the patient passed away at the age of one year. Family history evaluation revealed similarsymptoms in daughter of paternal cousin, who passed away at the age of 6 months. This patient had hypotonia, seizures, respiratory dif culty, and her brain MRI showed progres- sive atrophy of the white matter. Consanguinity was noted in parents of both patients. Results: Whole exome sequencing of the patient revealed a novel homozygous variant c.2077-2A>C in intron 23 of ADAM22 gene. The variant was not found in large exome databases, and several in-silico prediction programs classi-ed the mutation as \"pathogenic\" vs no benign predictions. Family segregation analysis demonstrated heterozygous carrier state in both parents, their healthy daughter, as wellas in parents of additional familial case with similar symptoms. Literature search yielded one description of compound heterozygous mutations in ADAM22 gene,424 J. del Picchiacausing rapidly progressing cerebral atrophy, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability. Previous research showed that knockout mice for ADAM22 manifest with lethal seizures during the rst postnatal weeks. Conclusions: Our case provides valuable information to the scarce literature evidence describing the associationbetween mutations in ADAM22 gene to severe neurologic morbidity. L. Sagi-Dain: None. S.

P10.03.A The genetic architecture of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the role of comorbidity in Italian population I. Palmieri 1,2, Medicine, Pavia, Italy,3Department Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease (ND) characterized by hetero-geneous clinical manifestations due to both genetic and phenotypic overlapping with other NDs, such as Fronto- temporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson 's disease (PD) paraplegia (HSP) (Elert-Dobkowska et al., 2019; Abramzon et al., 2020). Here, we screened an Italian population of 210 sporadic ALS patients for 95genes related to ALS, FTD, PD and HSP to enlighten the genetic burden in ALS clinical spectra. Materials and Methods: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was done using a customized panel of 175 genes (SureSelect, Agilent). The eVai software ( https://evai. engenome.com for variant calling and classi ca- tion. Pathogenic, likely pathogenic and uncertain variants were retained and validated by Sanger sequencing. C9orf72 repeat expansion was assessed using the AmplideX \u00aePCR/ CE C9orf72 Kit (Asuragen). Results: 81 ALS patients carry one or more variants in ALS/FTD associated genes. Interestingly, there are alsoALS patients that carry variants in PD (19) or in HSP (9) linked genes and patients that carry variants in genes related either to ALS and other NDs.

P10.04.B Different levels of soluble nuclear SOD1 activate speci c pathways in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells ofALS patients S. Gagliardi 1, M. Garofalo1,2, Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by loss of motor- neurons. SOD1 may have a toxic role in the pathogenesis when the protein aggregates in the cytoplasm; increasedaccumulation of nuclear SOD1 (nSOD1) represents a pro- tective cellular reaction (Cereda et al., 2013; Bordoni et al., 2019). We investigated pathways activated by nSOD1 inPeripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of ALS patients by dividing them depending on the \"high\"or\"low\" concentration of nSOD1. Methods: Subcellular fractionation from PBMCs of ALS patients (18) and healthy controls (12) was performed and proteins were quanti ed by Western blotting. RNA libraries were prepared by Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA LibraryAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 425and run on NextSeq (Illumina). Differential expression analysis was performed using R package EBSeq. Results: We obtained two gene expression patterns for high and low nSOD patients. Differentially expressed genes in patients with high nSOD1 form a cluster similar to controls compared to low nSOD1 group. Pathwaysactivated in high nSOD1 patients are related to the up- regulation of SEMA6B, a semaphorin involved in axon guidance, and HSP70, molecular chaperones ensuring thecorrect protein folding. In low nSOD1 group the up- regulation of KDM4C and S100B may be responsible for hyper-demethylation of histone H3 impaired in ALS. Conclusions: Ourndings highlight the importance of subcellular localization of soluble nSOD1 in ALS patients. We observed a different behavior of RNA regulation in thetwo groups of patients, leading to pathways conferring \"protection \"where nSOD1 was high, and a general \"where nSOD1 was low. S.

The aim of our workis to determine the effectiveness of high-throughput sequencing in patients with CP. Materials and methods: 604 patients, in whose clinical signs was CP, were examined using NGS-based tests (gene panels, containing up to 2000 genes, whole exome and genome sequencing). Data analysis was performed using in-house pipeline. Results: Among the provided clinical data, spastic manifestations were described in 256 patients (39.07%),atonic-astatic - in 111 patients (18.38%), mixed form - 45 patients (7.45%). Intellectual developmental disorder, speech delay were observed in 380 patients (62.91%),seizures - in 267 patients (44.21%). After testing de nitive diagnosis can be made in 31.8% cases, a possible cause wasdetected in 17.5%, a negative result was obtained in 50.6%. found in the investigated group. Copy number variations (CNVs) were determined by coverage analysis in 31 patients (10.4%). Conclusions: In our study NGS-based tests detected 31.8% clinically signi cant variants in patients with CP.

The pathogenesis of ARCMT is poorly understood. Over 30 ARCMT genes have been identi ed so far, yet they only explain a small portion of cases. The aim of this project is to identify novel causative ARCMT genes. Methods: Based on whole exome sequencing data of a cohort of 135 ARCMT families highly enriched with consanguineous pedigrees, we perform homozygosity mapping and focus on the resulting autozygous regions todo variant ltering and prioritization. The functional effect of the variants in candidate ARCMT genes is further characterized in vitro and in vivo, using Drosophila melanogaster as our main model of choice. Results: In 2 siblings with severe axonal CMT we have found a homozygous splice-site variant in a mitochondrialnuclear-encoded gene, that works as an assembly factor for cytochrome c oxidase. Screening for additional cases identi ed 5 additional families with 9 different variants. The splice variant leads to frame recovery and expression of an alternative transcript which lacks one exon. Immuno- blotting showed that the new isoform is effectivelytranslated into protein. The functional characterization of426 J. del Picchiathe mutant protein in patient-derived lymphoblasts and in yeast models is currently ongoing. Conclusions: We have established a gene discovery pipeline for ARCMT that combines exome sequencing with homozygosity mapping and functional experiments in cellular or in vivo models.

There no treatment for that haploinsuf ciency is tolerated for COL6A2 , knockdown of the allele including a pathogenic dominant-negative variant is under investigationas a treatment strategy for COL VI-CMD. The only approach for COL6A2 so far targeted a variant in intron 9 (c.954+17_954 +22del28). We focus on a group of patho- genic variants that lead to substitutions of essential Glycines in triple helical repeats (Gly-X-Y). Materials and Methods: The aim is to utilize CRISPR interference to repress the transcription of the mutated allele and to use common variants to differentiate between alleles. After the identi cation of common heterozygous variants in potential target sites (promotors, enhancers) via Sanger sequencing, the target region was enriched using Cas9 enrichment and sequenced with an Oxford NanoporeMinION. The data analysis was performed with a script containing several command line tools. Results: A 48kb region including enhancers, promotors and 24 exons of COL6A2 was successfully enriched, sequenced and the found variants were phased with the pathogenic variant. Outlook: Allele-speci c guideRNAs will be used to repress the transfection of the pathogenic allele. The project is supported by a grant of the German Society of Muscular Diseases (DGM).F.

Morocco Introduction: Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group ofneuromuscular disorders. The most common CMD subtype is laminin- 2 or merosin de cient (also known as MDC1A), accounting for 30-40%of CMD cases. It is characterized by muscle weakness at birth or within the rst months of life, delay in motor milestones, elevated creatine kinase (CK) and white matterabnormalities in brain MRI. MDC1A is an autosomal recessive condition caused by LAMA2 gene mutations. Patients and methods: We investigated six unrelated Moroccan patients with clinical and paraclinical signs of congenital muscular dystrophy. We performed a molecular analysis of a customized panel of 24 genes involved indifferent forms of muscular dystrophies by targeted next generation sequencing. Mutations were con rmed Trp739Ter) were identi ed in the LAMA2 gene. Conclusions: Next generation sequencing has improved genetic diagnosis pathway for heterogeneous diseases like muscular dystrophies. Our results allowed to provide appropriate management of patients and genetic counselingto families, and to expand mutational spectrum of LAMA2 gene in Moroccans. Y.

P10.14.C molecular character- A. Shukla Kasturba Medical Manipal, Karnataka, India Introduction: Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a neuromuscular transmission defect. They are rare and often treatable genetic disorders depending onthe underlying molecular defect. This study expands the mutational spectrum of CMS in India. Materials and Methods: We performed detailed clinical evaluation in seven patients with CMS from ve families and singleton exome sequencing in ve index patients. Validation of the identi ed variant and segregation analysis was done by Sanger sequencing. Results: All patients had autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Clinically signi cant variants were identi ed in 4 state. COLQ variant c.955-2A>C was identi- ed in two unrelated families. Patient with RAPSN variant had a later onset of disease while all others had an early- onset of disease. All patients with COLQ variant had generalized muscle weakness, those with DOK7 and RAPSN variants had limb-girdle weakness, and with CHRNE had predominant ocular weakness. Patients with COLQ andDOK7 variants showed improvement with salbutamol and CHRNE with pyridostigmine therapy. Conclusions: In CMS, genetic diagnosis is essential to guide pharmacotherapy and avoid adverse reactions to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in COLQ ,DOK7 , and slow channel CMS (AChR subunit genes). This study adds asmall but signi cant cohort of patients with CMS from India. S. Mishra: None. K. Girisha: None. A. Shukla: None. P10.15.A DHTKD1 R. G.

Numerous genes regulatingmitochondrial function have been associated with neuro- degeneration. In a pilot whole-exome sequencing study of 27 ALS patients, rare heterozygous variants in the DHTKD1 gene were recurrently identi one nonsense variant. DHTKD1 encodes a subunit acting in L-lysine degradation disease type2. Here, we aimed to investigate the frequency and clinical implications of rare DHTKD1 variants in an ALS cohort. Methods: n=46) and targeted ( n=179) sequencing of 225 unrelated ALS patients of central European ancestry. All patients were diagnosed according to the El Escorial criteria by aspecialized neurologist. Clinical (e.g. age and region of onset, ALS subtype, and disease progression) and diag- nostic (e.g. electrophysiological, biochemical) characteris-tics are being analyzed to discover genotype-phenotype relations. Results: Five missense and one nonsense variant, all rare (MAF < 0.5%) or novel and predicted to be pathogenic, were identi ed in 10 of 225 patients. Two of these variants were previously described in patients with 2-aminoadipicand 2-oxoadipic aciduria. Preliminary clinical correlations indicate a slightly later ALS onset in DHTKD1 variant carriers (median: 71 years) compared to non-carriers(median: 63 years). Conclusions: We identi ed rare heterozygous DHTKD1 in 4.4% of central European ALS patients. Potentialphenotype-genotype correlations and frequency of rare DHTKD1 variants in other ALS cohorts are currently being assessed. I. Gogol: None. A. Osmanovic: None. H. Martens: None. M.

Weishaupt: alterations: diagnosis and characterization of the genetic mechanisms involved L. Luce 1,2, M. Carcione1,2, C. Mazzanti1,2, para Madrid, 6CONICET linked recessive diseases caused by DMD mutations. Molecular alterations in this gene are large deletions/ duplications in 80% of cases and small mutations in the remaining. Several authors reported the occurrence of non-contiguous rearrangements within the same DMD allele, with frequencies up to 4%. The present work aims to characterize the incidence of complex rearrangements in anArgentinian dystrophinopathy cohort and unravel the causing molecular mechanisms. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 437 boys with clinical diagnosis of Dystrophinopathy. The following techniques were implemented: MLPA, In breakpoints were precisely determined, so we performed a bioinformatic screening of microhomologies, interspersed repeats, secondary structures and recombino-genic motifs 50pb surrounding each breakpoint. Results: We detected 6 patients carrying complex rearrangements in DMD: 2 deletions-duplications, 3 non- contiguous duplications and 1 large deletion plus a 20pb insertion. These accounted for 1.4% of our cohort. In a deletion-duplication case, familial segregation and bioinfor-matics analysis suggested that the duplication was the rst mutagenic event caused by Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS), while the deletion occurred secondlyby Non-homologous end joining. Furthermore, bioinfor- matic screening of the deletion plus insertion propose thatAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 429the deletion was due to Microhomology-mediated joining, while the insertion arose by FoSTeS. Conclusions: Ourndings widen the understanding of the molecular events that may take place in DMD and characterize the occurrence of complex rearrangements in our dystrophinopathy cohort.

Two male cousins had a previously unreported splicesite NM_004009.3:c.175-1G>T pathogenic variant in DMD gene. After negative testing for DMD gene, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy was con rmed using NGS in com- pound heterozygosity in FKRP gene in 3 patients, of which 2 were siblings(M/F): c.148A>G/c.985G>A, and one unrelated (c.826C>A/c.935G>C). Pompe disease wasdiagnosed in two brothers showing pathogenic variants in GAA gene (exon 18 deletion) and in one unrelated patient with c.784G>A/?. Carrier status for DMD was identi ed in 6 out of 10F. Using MLPA for DMD and a NGS panel of4813 genes, no pathogenic variants were detected in 4M and 1F (persistent extremely elevated CK levels). Conclusions: This study shows a diagnostic yield of almost 80% and lists the variants associated with myody- strophies, underling the limitation in establishing the diagnosis in patients with increased CK levels.

Neonatal orchildhood hypotonia can present with other symptoms, like decreased muscle tone, arthrogryposis or developmental delay making a de nite clinical diagnosis challenging. We aimed to assess the genetic causes of this condition, with interest in neuromuscular disorders (NMD). Patients and methods: For 124 patients with excluded common genetic causes of early hypotonia (e.g. SMA, PWS, MTM1 andACTA1 mutations), an exome sequencing430 del Picchiahave been performed. The rst-tier analysis of exome data has been done towards the identi cation of pathogenic variants in NMD-, arthrogryposis- or connective disorder-related genes. Results: in genes related to neuromuscular disorders (NMD) were identi ed in 42 patients. In 21 (32%) and 18 (27%) probands, we have found mutations in genes related to congenital myopathies or muscular dystrophies, respectively. The commonly affected genes includedLMNA ,RYR1 and TTN with 5, 4 and 3 patients with pathogenic variants, respectively. In 13 patients, mutations in non-NMD genes were found, including 2 cases withmutation in single cases. Conclusions: The genetic cause of floppy child syndrome was identi ed in 55/124 (44.3%) patients. Although the most commonly mutated genes are related to NMD, other genes involved in etiology of connective tissue disordersand syndromic hypotonia should be also considered.

Guskova Research centre for medical genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is FSHD molecular-genetic diagnostics requiresexpensive and laborious we present a newly developed simpli ed qPCR-based diagnostic approach and obtained results. Materials and Methods: Blood-derived DNA samples from 64 FSHD patients and 39 their phenotypically healthy relatives were examined by Southern blotting, molecularcombing, and a newly developed qPCR-based approach.Results: We validated the qPCR-based approach on 26 individuals with at least one allele of chromosome 4 D4Z4 array contracted up to 10-1 repeats, and on 19 individuals without the contraction. In 96% of the cases, qPCR-based results were concordant with the Southern blotting and molecular combing references. Remaining 60 individualswere analyzed only by qPCR-based approach. In a group of 64 affected individuals, FSHD diagnosis was con rmed for 36 (56.3%) patients. In 69% of the con rmed cases, pathogenic alleles had number of D4Z4 repeats in range between 3-6. We de ned 13 carriers in a group of 39 healthy relatives (33.3%). Among them, 76.9% of cases hadthe permissive allele with number of the D4Z4 repeats from 6 to 8. There were no signi cant prevalence between sex in any observed groups. Conclusions: In this work we present newly developed FSHD diagnostics approach based on qPCR and rst study of the FSHD genotyping in Russian patients. We observedenrichment of the permissive alleles in the range of 3-6 D4Z4 units among affected individuals, whereas among carriers permissive alleles were enriched in the range 6-8D4Z4 units. N.

Polyakov Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Hereditary spastic p araplegia (HSP) is highly heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative dis- eases that is characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs and mild sensory dysfunc-tion, due to the axonal degeneration in the pyramidal tract. Mutations in about 80 different loci and 60 genes have been associated with HSP pathogenesis. Thus the appli-cation of NGS technologies can enable the enhanced molecular diagnosis of HSP because multiple loci can be analyzed simultaneously. Herein we characterize a cohortof Russian HSP patients using NGS techniques along with the routine diagnostics. Materials and Methods: We screened DNA samples from 198 unrelated probands with HSP. Sanger sequencing ofSPAST gene was performed in 60 DNA samples, and ATL1 was analyzed in 24 of partially overlapping samples. DNA with unidenti ed mutations and non-tested samplesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 431were examined by MLPA-analysis and by target gene panel containing 63 HSP related genes. Results: We diagnosed the genetic type of for less than in 3% each). We nd 88 mutations across diagnosed patient, whereas 39 mutations were new. Remarkably, 85.2% of mutations were discovered by NGS and Sanger sequencing; and 14.8% of larger genomicrearrangements - by MLPA-analysis. Conclusions: Our data show that combination of NGS and routine methods allows for effective HSP diagnostics.This is the rst overview of the HSP mutations frequencies in Russian population that have to be further expanded.

Todate, more than 70 genes have been identi ed that con- tribute to the cause of HSP. Despite the use of next- generation sequencing-based methods, genetic-analysis in the nding in of HSP patients, indicating a signi cant genetic heterogeneity in the disease and emphasizing that the majority of HSP-geneshave remained unknown. Materials and Methods: To identi cation of Candidate variants were con rmed and co-segregated in the family members. Functional studies including RNAseq for a familyharboring a variation in a novel candidate-gene are currently in progress. Results: Variations in 18 known HSP-causing genes novel candidate-HSP gene were identi ed. Discussion: HSP-causing genes were detected in 26 probands(52%). Also, a novel candidate-gene that is exclusively expressed in the brain and directly involved inaxonogenesis was identi ed. Given that the HSP is a length- dependent, \"dying-back \"axonopathy, the candidate-gene can be an important HSP-causative gene. The researchpresented the powers of WES for facilitating gene- discovery and identi cation of causative genes for diseases with genetic heterogeneity. The precise mechanisms under-lying the HSP are unknown. Identi cation of novel genes and molecular-pathways will enhance our knowledge of the cellular pathways that are involved in the diseasepathogenesis. Grant-Reference: no.963846(NIMAD) R.

P10.26.C GWAS on hand grip strength: new insights into the genetics of muscular strength support a strong genetic component at different ages . F. Abbondanza , S. Paracchini University of St Andrews, St Andrews, United Kingdom Introduction: Hand grip strength (HGS) is a widespread proxy for muscular strength and a predictor of cardiovas- cular disease and poor health outcomes. Genetic studies in adult cohorts (e.g. UK Biobank) found multiple genesassociated with HGS and showed a modest heritability (h 2~24%). However, the genetics of HGS remains largely elusive and has never been explored in a cohort of youngindividuals. Materials and Methods: We performed GWAS analyses on three measures of HGS in the ALSPAC dataset(N~5,400, mean age =11.8 years), namely HGS for the right and left hand and grip strength maximal, i.e. best result regardless of the hand used. Analyses were performed inPLINK and functional mapping with FUMA. Genetic correlations and SNP-heritability were computed with LD Score Regression using summary statistics from UKBiobank. Results: We reported a novel genome-wide signi cant hit for HGS (rs2968991, p < 1.75E-08) with the right hand andwe replicated a common association in UK Biobank for the three traits (p < 1E-06). We reported a higher SNP-432 J. del Picchiaheritability than previous studies and highlighted a moderate-to-high genetic correlation between HGS in the current study and in the UK Biobank. Conclusions: In addition to a novel association, our analysis replicated some of the associations previously reported both at pathway (skeletal muscle bres and neurological disorders pathways) and gene-speci c (HOXB3) level. This, together with the modest-to-high genetic correlation with HGS in the UK Biobank suggests astable genetic component of HGS at different ages. This work was funded by the Royal Society. F.

Shariati Mashhad University Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Hypokalemic periodic paralysis(HOKPP) is a rare disorder usually manifesting by episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis. However in some cases, clinicalpresentation may be atypical and may be misdiagnosed with other possible progressive neurological diseases. The pre- sent report describes a case of HOKPP which was rst misdiagnosed as a case of distal spinal muscular atrophy (DSMA). Material and methods: A 5 years old male child referred because of variable distal limb weakness. The patient had a history of hypotonia at birth, evidence of irritable myopathy on electro-diagnostic study and elevated creatine-phosphokinase. The whole exome sequencing(WES) revealed a variant with unknown signi cant(VUS) in IGHMBP2 gene(c.403A>G) causing DSMA. However, the VUS was not con rmed in segregation analysis and the patient 's WES data was reanalyzed with a genotype rst approach. Results: The FASTQ les were reanalyzed by Seam- less TMsoftware and the pathogenicity of 112 variants which were pathogenic or likely pathogenic were checked inVarsome TMand Sixteen pathogen and likely pathogen variants were remained checked in OMIMTMdatabase. Only 1 candidate variant in CACNA1S gene(c.3724A>G) causing HOKPP was remained. After a brief history taking, prolonged episodes of muscle weakness after exercises in school was reported. Our segregation study on patient 's family con rmed the diagnosis of HOKPP and the patient 'sfather also reported milder and similar weakness in his childhood and carried the same mutation. Conclusions: The present experience demonstrates that a genotype rst approach can be helpful in discovering novel mutation in rare diseases even with atypical clinical presentations or negative WES results.

Bonapace1, IBFM/CNR; Institute of Neurology, is a peripheral nerve hyper- excitability (PNH) syndrome that presents as continuous motor activity. Mutations in the KCNA1 gene, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel,Kv1.1 subunit, have been found to be associated with this syndrome. Materials and Methods: The patient was a 56-year man presenting cramps painful stiffness of calves, undulating wave-like rippling of left thigh muscles. The neurological examination showed visible myokymias of left thigh.Electromyography revealed spontaneous continuous single motor unit discharges ring at a high intraburst frequency (>150 Hz)compatible with neuromyotonic discharges, onvastus medialis of left tight. Single needle electromyo- graphy and nerve conduction studies were unremarkable. Brain MRI and laboratory test excluded autoimmune orparaneoplastic conditions. The Molecular analysis revealed no point mutation on the KCANA1 gene. Based on the recently identi ed role for C9ORF72 protein, in modulating the membrane channel subunits maturation, an Amplicon- length analysis on the C9ORF72 gene, was performed. Results: Capillary electrophoresis analysis of the patient amplicon revealed the presence of a 94 pathological CCCGG expansion. Conclusions: The Kv1.1 subunit recycling processes is driven by speci c Rab proteins and regulated by the C9ORF72 protein acting both as Rab effector and component of the GTP ase exchange factor GEF. Wehypothesize that the loss of function of the c9orf72 protein, due to the CCCGG expansion can affect the traf cking ofAbstracts from the 53rd European Society (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 433the Kv1.1 monomers leading to a reduction in the channel subunits correctly allocated into the plasma membrane, altering the normal flows of potassium during the action potential generation.

The children were born to con-sanguineous parents of Roma ethnicity. Exome sequencing identi PAPD5 genes. These variants were present in heterozygous state in the parents. LBX1 is a transcription factor that affects migration of muscle precursor cells and it has been associated with adultidiopatic scoliosis. Identical frameshift variant (p.Val236A- lafsTer59) was described in a recent publication (Hernan- dez-Miranda et al., 2018) as a variant that interferes onlywith a subset of Lbx1 functions, speci cally, with the ability to cooperate with Phox2b. This disturbance leads to congenital central hypoventilation. The variant was presentin one individual of Roma ethnicity in our internal database but is absent from GnomAD database. Ethnicity-speci c genomic databases would be useful tools to estimatepopulation frequency of candidate variants. The effect of the homozygous frameshift variant in PAPD5/TENT4B gene (p.Ser610ArgfsTer56) is not clear. The gene is classi ed as intolerant to the loss of function (pLI=0,999) but it is not associated with any disorder. The TENT4B enzyme was recently described as a noncanonicalpoly(A) polymerase that generates mixed poly(A) tails with intermittent guanyl residues that shield mRNA from degradation (Lim et al., 2018). Two homozygous candidate variants in siblings born to consanguineous parents substantially complicate a potentialprenatal or preimplantation genetic testing in the family. At the same time, it underscores the importance of whole- exome sequencing. D. Musalkova: None. L. Noskova: None. V. None. P. Melenovska: None. R. Dobrovolny: None. H. Treslova: None. K.

Inapproximately 2.000 exome sequenced patients included in the MYO-SEQ project we identi ed c.1746-20C>G 26 times in heterozygosity and 1 time in homozygosity. Werecruited further centres from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and UK. We identi ed the c.1746-20C>G for c.1746- 20C>G. Most of the patients were of Polish or EasternEuropean origins. In all these cases there was reduced cal- pain3 expression on Western Blots and muscle MRI in available cases was suggestive for LGMD R1 calpain3-related. The phenotype of these patients was keeping up with mild calpainopathy with characteristic hypertrophies. Population studies suggest allele frequency of 0.017 inPoland and 0.015 in Estonia. No homozygous healthy individuals were identi ed so far in our populational studies and according to gnomAD there are 3 homozygous indi-viduals (out of 282.874). In some populations the variant was rare or nearly absent. Functional studies are ongoing. Population frequency data suggest that c.1746-20C>G maybe a hypomorphic variant. Preliminary haplotype analysis of a patient homozygous for c.1746-20C>G revealed a434 J. del Picchiahaplotype block, indicating this might be a founder allele in Polish population.

Features include hypertrophy of calfmuscles and elevated level of serum CK. Age of onset, progression and distribution of weakness vary according to genetic subtypes which are related to more than 30 genes.We aimed to correlate the clinical manifestations and clin- ical exome sequencing results of 29 patients with LGMD from Turkey. Method: 29 patients with clinical diagnosis of LGMD were recruited to NGS-based clinical exome screening of 4811 genes, we performed during 2017-2019, at tertiaryhealth center, Istanbul/Turkey. Results: In 28 patients, 34 variants were identi ed, seven of variants are novel. In 28 patients, the most commonsubtypes were LGMD R1 calpain3-related one patient (3.57%) and one patient with no variant related to the phenotype. Rare clinical presentations were observed, one LGMD R10titin-related patient with cognitive/psychomotor retardation and a LGMD ledto diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases in seven patients.Conclusions: The result of the cohort led to better understanding of the relative prevalence of different LGMD subtypes and genotype-phenotype correlation in Turkish population.

More than 40 genes were identi ed and genotype-phenotype correlation is not clear for most of cases. The aim of this study is to improve the genotypic features of muscular dystrophiesother than Duchenne-Becker Muscular Dystrophy with novel mutations. Thirty-three patients who were suffering from muscular dystrophy were referred to our clinic. Sixteenpatients were male and seventeen patients were female. Mean age was 22,06 years and mean age of disease onset was 11,48 years. Creatinine kinase levels were between 27.000 and Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) panel which has 33 muscular dystrophy related genes were sequenced for all patients. Reported pathogenic mutations infourteen patients and novel mutations in twelve patients were identi ed. One patient 's biopsy had shown megaconial changes, NGS panel revealed homozygous c.1031G>A(p.Arg344Gln) known mutation in CHKB gene. Another mutation in CHKB gene which was novel homozygous c.1130G>T(p.Arg377Leu) mutation was detected in eleven-year-old patient. Novel homozygous c.195 +3A>T mutation in SGCG gene was identi ed in patient whose biopsy showed pathogenic staining with gamma-sarcoglycan. In thirty-four-year-old patient and her sibling who had same clinic novel homozygous c.3666delA(p.Asp1223Thefs*24) mutation in DYSF gene were identi ed. In CAPN3 gene two novel homozygous mutations were detected, which were c.691T>C (p.Phe231Leu) and c.850C>T(p.Arg284Cys) mutation in two unrelated patients were detected, which indicates this muta- tion may have founder effect.

Here, next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to investigategenomic variants including copy number variants (CNV) to determine causative variants behind clinical presentations in patients. DNA samples were extracted from 309 patients withpresentation of muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy who were referred to our laboratory. NGS was performed to investigate genes associated with muscular disorders. NGSndings were validated using other molecular methods such as MLPA, QPCR, long PCR, and PCR-Sanger sequencing. In 275 out patients, variants with pathogenic or likelypathogenic classi cations (88.9%) were detected. Based on genetic nding and other clinical and para-clinical data, diagnosis was con rmed in these 275 patients. Total number of known or novel detected pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants is 303 variants in 51 genes. The most frequent genes causing the disease in this study were the most common mutations detected in our patients were gross deletion/duplication variants in DMD gene, SGCBdeletions and deletion of exon 7 in SMN1 gene. Detailed analysis of data will be presented in the meeting. In addition to obtaining valuable data regarding genetic epidemiology ofhereditary muscular diseases in Iran, this study showed great value of NGS for de ning causative variants in patients with muscular diseases. High frequency of CNVs detected as thecausative variants in patients shows the necessity of developing ef cient tools for CNV analysis on NGS data. M. Asadollahi: None. A. Karamzade: None. M.

P10.36.A Usefulness studying myopathies muscular dys- through Exome Sequencing: an Sciences Research Institute Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona (Barcelona), Spain Muscle weakness and hypotonia usually suggest a clinical diagnosis of myopathy or muscular dystrophy. However,these pathologies include more than 50 subtypes and are associated with more than 250 genes, making an accurate diagnosis challenging. Genetic testing through NGS has a huge impact on diagnosis due to its ability to analyze, in parallel, large number of genes and due to the possibility of reanalyzingnon-conclusive cases including new disease-causing genes. Such potential has been proven to be even useful for the diagnosis of families with a strong history of hereditarydisease when no affected members are available and healthy relatives must be tested. Here, we applied NGS to a cohort of 73 patients with clinical or familial suspicion of myopathy or muscular dystrophy. Samples were analyzed using SureSelect XT Human All Exon kit (Agilent) and a HiSeq sequencer(Illumina). An in-house pipeline was used for the bioinfor- matic analysis. Fifty-four out of 73 individuals were analyzed using a whole clinical exome approach while theothers were analyzed through virtual panels. Variant ltering was performed based on variant effect, familial pattern of inheritance, allele frequency and informationavailable in databases. Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 23 out of 73 patients (31,5%) including a patient with a complex phenotype oftricuspid insuf ciency with structural heart disease and bromyalgia. In 39 patients only VOUS were detected (53,4%). In 11 out of 73 patients (15,1%) no candidatevariants were found. These results con rm exome sequen- cing as an effective strategy to study myopathies and muscular dystrophies. Y. Moreno-Saez: None. A. Romera-L\u00f3pez: None. A. And\u00fajar: None. A.

From 2015 till 2020 our variant analysis team interpreted NGS data for 837 patients with myopathy or myasthenia, mostly from Russia and other Russian-speaking countries. The set included 271 clinical exomes, 176 WES, 16 WGS, and 374 custom panels of several types comprising in most cases >2000 genes. After pro-cessing via an automated pipeline, the variants were uploaded into a custom database-driven software and assessed by clinical bioinformaticians, with subsequentreview of the reports by medical geneticists, when possible. As a result, 336 patients (40%) had de nitive molecular diagnostic ndings explaining the diagnosis based on variants of unknown signi cance with a need for additional evidence. Maximum success rate was in infants who were less than 1 year old at the time of test (59%; 53/90 cases) and minimum success rate was inadults 18 years and older (33%; 56/170 cases). In 59 suc- cessful cases (18% of 336; 7% of total) the result was due to detection of CNVs, and this was not limited to DMD deletions/duplications. The CNV ratio here is higher than in our other patient cohorts, indicating high importance of CNV analysis step in myopathy/myasthenia cases. Mole-cular diagnostics of neuromuscular disorders is complex due to their clinical variability and genetic heterogeneity,requiring a combination of exome-scale NGS and thorough data analysis. M.

Here we report on a familial case series where members with MC of varying severity harbour different combinations of patho-genic variants in these two genes. Materials and methods: Five out of six family members display the classical spectrum of MC features. Proband(aged 57), her two daughters (aged 37 and 24), her grandson (aged 17), and a cousin (aged 45) have similar complaints of muscle rigidity in the extremities and face, provoked bycold or potentially elicited by percussion of muscles. The youngest grandson (aged 8) does not exhibit symptoms representative of his age. EMG of three individuals (mother,older daughter, cousin) showed classical excessive myo- tonic discharges.

Patients present with hypotonia and severe atrophy of various parts of their brain,resulting in slow development, movement problems and intellectual disability, even death. Material and Methods: In our family, we identi ed the causative mutation by massively parallel sequencing, using a clinical-exome kit (Illumina) in three affected patients (post-mortem, from archived DNA samples). Following theinitial nding, we screened the respective genomic position in the remaining family members using Sanger sequencing. Results: In the affected family members we identi ed a rare homozygous pathogenic variant c.92G>C in the EXOSC3 gene, causing an autosomal recessive PCH type 1B. Unaffected parents and four siblings are heterozygouscarriers, one healthy sibling has a wild type genotype and three affected siblings were homozygous and died soon after birth (2-6 months of age). Two other siblings were notanalyzed, however, one of them also died soon after birth and suffered most probably from the same disorder. Conclusions: We report detailed clinical ndings of the largest PCH type 1B family published up to date, with fouraffected children. The causative variant was reported to be more frequent in the Roma population of the Czech Republic (considered a founder mutation). Based on the close connection of the populations of Slovakia and the Czech Republic, we hypothesize, these two alleles may have a common origin. Therefore, we are still investigatingtheir haplotype background. Funding: APVV-18-0319; None. J. Barosova: None. M. Hyblova: None. T. Szemes: None. L. Kadasi: None. J. Radvanszky: None.

The assembly of myelinated bres and nodes of Ranvier is mediated by a number of cell adhesion molecules of theimmunoglobulin superfamil y including neurofascin, encoded by the NFASC gene, its alternative isoforms Nfasc186, Nfasc140 and Nfasc155. We identi ed 10 individuals from six unrelated families, exhibiting a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized with a438 J. del Picchiaspectrum of central and peripheral neurological involve- ment, who were found by NGS to carry frameshift and non-synonymous variants . Expression studies using immunostaining-based techniques identi ed absent expression of the Nfasc155 isoform as a consequence of the frameshift variant and a signi cant reduction of expression was also observed in association with two non- synonymous variants affecting the bronectin type III domain. Cell aggregation studies revealed a severelyimpaired Nfasc155-CNTN1/CASPR1 complex interaction as a result of variants. Immuno showed a severe loss of myelinated bres and abnormalities in the paranoda l junction morphology. Our results establish that recessive variants affecting theNfasc155 isoform can affect the formation of paranodal axoglial junctions at the nodes of Ranvier. The genetic disease caused by biallelic NFASC variants includesneurodevelopmental impairment and a spectrum of central and peripheral demyelination as part of its core clinical phenotype. Our ndings support possible overlapping molecular mechanisms of paranodal damage at peripheral nerves in both the immune-mediated and the genetic disease.

To date, 18 disease-causinggenes have been identi ed, all encoding for proteins involved in the glycosylation of -dystroglycan and thus affecting its binding to the extracellular matrix. Methods: As part of the MYO-SEQ project, detailed clinical and histological information was collected for 1,803 patients with unexplained LGMW. Whole-exome sequen-cing was carried out and genes known to be associated with dystroglycanopathies were analysed to identify likely pathogenic variants. Results: Suspected disease-causing variants in 8 genes were detected in 47 patients: DPM3 andISPD in one patient each, FKTN ,POMK and POMT1 in two patients, GMPPB in four patients, POMT2 in 14 patients and FKRP in 21 patients. The overall frequency for the disease group was 2.6%. The phenotypes were highly variable, generallypresenting with progressive proximal muscle weakness and high CK, yet cognitive impairment was not always observed. Muscle biopsies were available for 21 cases;reported results of -dystroglycan labelling were incon- sistent, indicating that standardised immunohistochemical protocol and training in its interpretation are crucial. Inaddition, we looked at undiagnosed patients carrying two or more heterozygous pathogenic variants in two different dystroglycanopathy genes, however we did not nd evidence of digenic inheritance in this pathway. Conclusions: Given their genetic and phenotypic hetero- geneity, here we highlight the advantage of using next-generation sequencing in combination with traditional histopathological analysis to improve the diagnosis of dystroglycanopathies as a rare disease group.

Recently, biallelic pathogenic variants in PDXK were shown to atrophy We performed whole exome sequencing and segregation analysis using Sanger sequencing in order touncover the pathogenic variant(s) in a family affected by an undiagnosed autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy. Pathogenicity of the via enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on dried blood-spot samples, derived from all members of the family. Results: Here, we report two affected individuals, aged 17 and 14 years old, from a consanguineous Iranian family presenting with a childhood-onset sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and rst signs of optic atrophy. Genetic analysis identi ed a segregated novel homozygous missense variant in PDXK, (NM_003681.4); c.225T>A, p.(Asn75Lys). We show that the variant leads to reduced PDXK enzymaticactivity with low PLP. The relatively early diagnosis and PLP replacement restored the PLP plasma levels with observable clinical improvement. Conclusions: We recommend that patients presenting with autosomal recessive childhood-onset axonal neuro- pathy and optic atrophy should be screened for PDXKmutations, as this is a rare opportunity for treatment.P.N.

HINT1 gene c.110G>C, (p.Arg37Pro) variant already reported in the literature as the most commonpathogenic variant [P. La uthov\u00e1, 2016]. Here, we describe genetic and phenotypic characteristics of patients with ARAN-NM in Lithuania. Materials and methods: By using multigene NGS panel, we identi ed 8 patients with recessive variants in HINT1 gene from 2014 to 2019. Results: Eight patients showed homozygous or com- pound heterozygous variants in HINT1 gene, including previously reported pathogenic variant c.110G>C p.(Arg37-Pro) and a novel variant c.299A>G p.(Glu100Gly): i) ve patients harboured a homozygous pathogenic variant c.110G>C, ii) two patients had compound heterozygousvariants (c.110G>C and c.299A>G), and iii) one patient had a homozygous novel variant, which was also identi ed in affected brother. Co-segregation of these variants inaffected sibs or healthy relatives con rmed a recessive inheritance. Patients with homozygous novel and previously reported HINT1 variants shared pure axonal motor neuropathy. Conclusions: Novel variant in HINT1 has been identi ed from three unrelated patients. Our data expand the spectrumof pathogenic variants in HINT1 and its signi cance in molecular diagnosis. Additionally, our ndings support that previously reported variant c.110G>C may result from afounder mutation in European populations.440 J. del PicchiaB. Burnyte: None. A. Morkuniene: None. K.

P10.46.B The result of NGS disease speci c panel for practical genetic diagnostics of neuromuscular disorders . I. Ukraine,2Lviv Regional Clinical Hospital, Lviv, Ukraine Introduction: The genetic determined neuromuscular dis- ease are characterized by broad spectrum of clinical dis-orders and clinical polymorphism. Materials and Methods: We analyze the results of using NGS for practical genetic diagnostics. Genetic testing wasperformed among 65 person (55% male), 1 to 56 y.o with clinicaly unexplained progressive neuromuscular pathol- ogy. DNA samples was extracted from blood leucocytesand common mutilations for DMD and SMA were excluded by target testing. The Illumina technology for 289 genes associated with muscular dystrophies, myopathies, neuro-pathies was performed at INVITAE laboratory, USA. All clinically signi cant observations were additionally conrmed. Results: The positive results - identi cation of at least one pathogenic variant in the gene panel, were received for 35/ 65 (54%) of cases. The conformation of CAPN3 autosomalrecessive limb-girdle muscular was the most frequent, 9.2%: three patients c.550del homozygous and two compound with other mutations. Charcot-Marie-Toothdisease was diagnosed in association with mutations in PMP22, MFN2, GJB1, GDAP1 genes in 6.2%. The other than deletion DMD genetic variants were identi ed in 4 males. The interesting nding of this study: TCF4 deletion of entire coding sequence associated with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome; copy number gains for X-chromosome genesand XXY in boy with SMA- like clinical phenotype. In 40% of patients the diagnosis of monogenic disorder was con rmed with use of NGS disease speci c panel. The clinical treatment of VUS is challenging. Conclusions: The collaboration between molecular geneticist, clinical geneticist and neurologist guarantee the correct diagnosis for patients with orphan neuromuscular disease. I. Haiboniuk: None. H.

In the current study, we describe a severe case of NMIHBA due to the compound heterozygosity of amissense and a novel frameshift variant in the PRUNE1 gene. Materials and Methods: The affected proband is a 3.5- year-old girl generalized muscular hypo- tonia, drug-resistant epilepsy (10-15 myoclonic seizures daily) and severe swallowing problems. Serious develop-mental and speech delay is also present. The clinical examination of the patient has detected scoliosis and kyphosis, high myopia, frequent respiratory tract infections,tooth enamel loss and severe constipation. WES was performed in three family members (proband & parents) using SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kit in a HiSeq4000instrument. The detected variants were con rmed by Sanger sequencing analysis. Results: WES analysis detected two PRUNE1 affected proband, c.316G>A (p.Asp106Asn) and c.181_185delTCTGA (p. Ser61Thrfs*6), the rst of paternal and the second of maternal origin, con rming the compound heterozygosity in the index patient. Conclusions: Given that PRUNE1 gene has recently been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and conse- quently it is not included in older custom NGS gene panels, WES application constituted the most ef cient approach for the molecular investigation of the speci c case. These results highlight the utility of WES in order to reveal the genetic etiology of complex phenotypes, allowing the betterclassi cation of the patients and the design of personalized therapeutic strategies.

Due to the strongly overlapping phe- notypes, the differential diagnosis of non-5q-SMAs ischallenging. Materials/Methods: 52 patients analysed by a large gene panel with 479 neuromuscular disease-causing genesreceived no conclusive results. We re-evaluated 21 unsolved cases by trio whole-exome sequencing (trio- WES), in addition to nine families without previous panelanalysis. Results: In 10/21 individuals with negative panel results, trio-WES revealed the pathogenic variant (48%). Of theseten identi ed genes, ve (50%) were associated with genes involved in mitochondrial function ). The remaining genes encoded for proteins of diverse functions, with one variant in the lysosomal enzyme-encoding gene ARSA , one in a gene required for amino acid synthesis ( SEPSECS ) and one in the muscle protein-coding TTN. Additionally, we identi ed a variant in a gene relevant for cellular stress response ( ADPRS ) and one encoding an enzyme essential for vitamin B6 metabolism ( PDXK ). Among nine patients with no prior gene panel testing, we diagnosed four patients (4/9) with pathogenic variants in known neuromusculardisease genes. Discussion: Inborn errors of organelle metabolism might primarily manifest with neuropathic features in childhood.Our preliminary analysis shows that mutations in mitochon- drial proteins are the leading cause in this spectrum. Due to abundance and high number of the associated genes, andhigh clinical variability, we recommend performing WESinstead of gene panels, in order to address the extreme heterogeneity of the causal pathomechanisms.

P10.49.B Comparison of gene panel and alpha-glucosidase activ- ity on dried blood spot in patients with suspected muscle disease in order to screen and diagnose Pompe disease F. Thuriot 1,2, caused by alpha-glucosidase (GAA) de ciency, leading pro- gressive limb-girdle weakness and respiratory insuf ciency. Limb-girdle weakness is the most common form of muscle weakness and Pompe disease is hard to differentiate,delaying diagnosis and administration of treatment. Enzy- matic activity of GAA is wildly used to screen patients but sequencing of GAA is required to con rm the diagnosis. In order to investigate if potential Pompe cases could be missed by using a gene panel approach alone, we screened 876 patients with a suspected muscle disease, and comparedGAA enzymatic activity on dried blood spot with an 89- gene panel. Eight patients were diagnosed with Pompe disease; enzymatic activity and sequencing results wereconcordant. Of the 36 patients carrying a single hetero- zygous GAA variant, only one patient harboring a patho- genic heterozygous variant had low enzyme activityoverlapping with levels seen in Pompe cases suggesting that a second variant could have been missed. RNA studies are pending. Finally, nine patients had low or borderlineenzyme activity, but no variant was detected. These patients have a low risk of having Pompe disease since enzymatic activity is close to the threshold and does not overlap withconrmed Pompe cases. With gene panels being increas- ingly performed as a rst-tier test for patients with sus- pected muscle disorders, our study emphasizes the need toperform re flex enzymatic activity in patients with a single GAA variant. RNA sequencing should be considered if it the enzymatic result is compatible with Pompe. *Supported by J. del Dynacare. E. None. C.

With massive parallel sequencing anda laboratory developed Mendeliome gene panel, we iden- tied a truncation mutation in the PTRH2 gene in two affected siblings. This multifunctional the of peptidyl-tRNA. It is also a key determinant incell survival, growth and apoptosis processes. The precise role of the protein in muscle disease has still to be deli- neated. Our index patients are the 15- and 13-year-old sonand daughter of non-consanguineous healthy Nepalese parents. Both patients had multiple neurological symptoms including sensorineural deafness, psychomotor and lan-guage delay, epilepsy and behavioral disturbances, subse- quently motor regression with ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and later, in one of them, diabetes mellitus. In both patients,pancreatic echography disclosed hyper-echogenicity. A homozygous pathogenic 1 base pair insertion c.127dupA was revealed in the PTRH2 gene of both siblings, and conrmed with Sanger sequencing. This frameshift causes a premature translation stop p.(Ser43Lysfs*11), and is present in heterozygosity in both parents. Originally, a homozygousdeletion variant in the PTRH2 gene was identi ed as the molecular cause of global developmental delay, hearing lossand ataxia. Since 2014, the identi cation of additional patients has documented a clinical heterogeneity, and expanded the clinical spectrum of pathogenic PTRH2 var- iants.

Rost1 W\u00fcrzburg, Institute Germany,2Praxis f\u00fcr Humangenetik, Bremen, Germany Lipin-1, a protein coded by the LPIN1 gene, plays an important role in the human triglyceride synthesis. MutationsinLPIN1 lead to recurrent rhabdomyolysis with myoglobi- nuria, myalgia and generalized weakness in childhood. We investigated two independent cases with rhabdomyolysis.Patient 1 is a six-year-old Turkish boy with healthy con- sanguineous parents. His sister died of a respiratory infection at the age of 3. He showed massively increased creatininekinase (CK) levels (up to 400.000 U/l) and myoglobinuria. Patient 2 is a German 36-year-old women with myalgia, increased CK values and a history of kidney failure aftergastrointestinal infection in early childhood. The DNA was processed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) after enrichment of a custom-made myopathy panel (65 genes).Data analysis was done by GensearchNGS. Three different variants in LPIN1 could be identi ed, a large recurrent dele- tion including exon 18, a nonsense variant and a single basepair duplication. Patient 1 carries the deletion and the dupli- cation, each in homozygous state. The duplication has not been described before, is not present in gnomAD and leads toa frameshift with a premature stop codon at position 769. Patient 2 carries the same deletion of exon 18 and a known nonsense variant leading to a stop codon at position 19. Thebreaking points of the deletion could be identi ed exactly by NGS. Our ndings revealed a novel and already known mutations in LPIN1 and veri ed the breakpoints of the recurrent deletion. This con rms the causative role of LPIN1 mutations in patients with muscular disorders. Y. Jelting: None. A. Zaum: None. S. SNX14 geneAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics Conference: Interactive center, Haifa, Israel,2Rambam medical center, Haifa, Israel Background: Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 20 (SCAR20) is a rare disorder, mainly characterized byintellectual disability, ataxia, coarse facial features, pro- gressive loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and often hearing loss and skeletal abnormalities. Case report: We describe a 3.5 years old boy, fourth child to consanguineous parents, double rst cousins from Druze origin. Prenatal sonographic examination demonstrated periven- tricular dysmorphic small cave ofseptum pellucidum and shortened long bones of the legs (5 th percentile). Amniocentesis for chromosomal microarrayanalysis yielded normal results. Magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) demonstrated hypogenesis of corpus callosum and delayed myelination of the white matter. Examination of the 3.5 year old boy at our genetics clinicdemonstrated global severe developmental delay, vision impairment, severe hypotonia, lower motor neuron lesion characteristics and some dysmorphic signs. Results: Two bioinformatics analyses of exome sequen- cing did not reveal any pathogenic ndings. However, the third exome re-evaluation raised suspicion of about 200bpdeletion in the SNX14 gene, including part of exon 13 and intron 14.

Tizzano1 1Department of Clinical and Molecular Genetics and Medicine Genetics Group, VHIR, University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain,2Servei de Gen\u00e8tica, i Sant Barcelona, Las Hospi- tal, Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuro- muscular disorder caused by loss of function of both copies ofSMN1 . SMA patients are classi ed into different clinical groups. Copy number of SMN2 , the highly homologous copy ofSMN1 , is considered the most important phenotypic modier of the disease but this correlation is not absolute. In the present therapeutic scenario with SMN2 splicing modi- ers patients receive expensive treatments and there are dif- ferent degrees of responses (responders, slow responders, non-responders). All SMN2 copies are not always equivalent. Thus, in deep analysis of the SMN2 genotype could provide useful information to further characterize SMA patients. Materials and Methods: We study 53 SMA patients with homozygous SMN1 -deletion to determine their SMN2 sequences. DNA samples were sequenced by Long-PCR and NGS. The ampli ed region includes the complete SMN2 gene (promoter, 5 'UTR and 3 'UTR regions). Variant analysis was performed using a bioinformatic pipeline adapted to the complexity of the region. Results: We found previously described modi er variants c.859G>C, c.835-44A>G, c.835-1897C>T in 5 patients, and 10 new candidates, being two of them recurrent.Additionally we have detected SMN1-SMN2 hybrid in two patients. Conclusions: our technique was useful to accurately characterize the SMN2 copies, identifying described and new modi er variants. Further functional analysis of those candidates should be essential for categorization. In thecurrent framework of new therapies it is extremely important to characterize historical and new patients that receive further advanced treatments. Funded by Biogen andFIS PI18/00687 L.

Kraft Institute of Human Genetics RWTH University Hospital, Aachen, Germany Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)-5q is an autosomal- recessive neuromuscular disorder with a frequency of app. 1:4,900 in the European population. Mutations in the Sur- vival Motor Neuron (SMN) 1 gene are responsible for thedisease while the copy number of SMN2 modi es the patient 's phenotype. Both genes are located in a highly homologous, duplicated and inverted region on chromo-some 5q. The majority of patients carry a homozygous deletion of SMN1 but 3-4% of patients are compound heterozygous for the deletion on one and single nucleotidevariants (SNV) on the other allele. There are not more than ve unique sequence differences between SMN1 and SMN2, only one of those, c.840C/T, in the coding sequenceand the others in intronic or non-coding regions. When a patient suspected of having SMA carries a heterozygous deletion of SMN1, direct sequencing of the SMN1 gene todetect a second pathogenic SNV is necessary. Due to the nearly 100 % sequence identity it is almost impossible to distinguish SMN1 and SMN2 sequences with standardsequencing approaches and a SNV cannot be assigned unequivocally to one of the genes. Several sequencing strategies to overcome this problem have been introduced,all of them being rather laborious. We have established a long-range Nanopore sequencing protocol that allows unequivocal assignment of variants to SMN1 or SMN2, andthereby improves the diagnostics for the patient and genetic counselling for the family. In times of promising therapeutic approaches for SMA-5q, it is crucial to make a fast andunambiguous diagnosis of the disease. K. Eggermann: None. T. Pster: None. I. Kurth: None. F. Kraft: None. P10.55.B Update on SMN1 mutations in Spanish SMA patients: description of new rare missense, nonsense and splicing mutations L. Al\u00edas 1, S. Bernal1, March2, IIB- Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain,5Dept. Of Clinical andMolecular Genetics and Diseases Unit, Hospital Vall d'Hebr\u00f3n, Barcelona, Spain Background: Homozygous absence of SMN1 is the major genetic cause of SMA (90%), the remaining cases are hybrid SMN2-SMN1 genes (4.6%) and rare point mutations (5%). When a patient has no homozygous deletion, SMA molecular diagnostic is of utmost importance to include him in a speci c advanced treatment considering the current SMA landscape. Materials and Methods: TheSMN genes were quanti ed by MLPA in 931 unrelated Spanish SMA patients. Sangersequencing was usefully to detect point mutations in the SMN1 gene. C212 and C272 molecular markers were analysed to From our 834 of the SMN1 ; (4.5%) showed homozygous absence of only exon 7, harbouring at leastoneSMN2-SMN1 hybrid gene; 46 (4.9%) showed a point mutation in the SMN1 gene, being the c.399_402delAGAG in exon 3 and the c.770_780dup11 in exon 6 responsible ofthe 65.2% of the cases (20 and 10 respectively), other 11 known and 3 novel (missense:c.808A>C, nonsense: c.188C>A and splicing:c.724-1G>C) point mutations weredetected. Interestingly, just one SMN1 deleted allele was found in 9 symptomatic patients but any other pathogenic variant in the other allele has been currently identi ed. Conclusions: Although the vast majority of Spanish SMA cases present an homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene, a minority of cases can be explained due to other raremutations that are necessary to discover by Sanger or Next Generation Sequencing. Genetic con rmation of these patients is crucial in order to include them in therapeuticprotocols. FIS-PI18/00687 L. Al\u00edas: None. S. Bernal: None. F. March: None. I. Cusc\u00f3: None. L.

Additionally, detection of c.859G>C in SMN2 is linked to reduced disease severity and prognosis while gene dupli-cation variants c.*3 +80T>G and c.*211_*212del in SMN1 can inform carrier risk in several populations. Methods: We validated the AmplideX \u00aePCR/CE SMA Plus Kit, which quanti es 0 to 4SMN1 andSMN2 exon7 copy numbers and the three informative variants. Auto- mated analysis with AmplideX PCR/CE Reporter softwareincorporates batch and sample QC checks to qualify results. We assessed single-site precision and accuracy of SMN1 and SMN2 copy number and variant detection against reference methods using DNA samples isolated from whole blood with over ve puri cation methods. We also assessed analytical speci city, reagent stability, and other perfor- mance factors. Results and Conclusion: SMN1 andSMN2 copy number and variant measurements were concordant with referencemethods for all isolation methods. Further, results were precise across 200 sample measurements generated with three reagent lots and two operators over multiple runs/days. The assay was speci c for all genes and variants. The AmplideX PCR/CE SMA Plus Kit is in development for in vitro diagnostic use for carrier screening and diseasediagnosis, and provides accurate and reliable results in under four hours. W.

Peleg1 1Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel,2The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Hifa, Israel Introduction: Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by lossof lower motor neurons. All types of SMA are caused by homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene, resulting in low levels of the survival motor neuron protein, insuf cient to protect motor neurons. Homozygous deletions of exon 7 in SMN1 gene in clinically asymptomatic individuals are extremely rare, involving less than 30 described cases. These patientsusually have several copies of the SMN2 gene, which compensates for the loss of SMN1 product. Case presentation: An asymptomatic 31-years old woman was referred for pregestational genetic testing within the Israeli national genetic carrier-screening program for reproductive purposes. Carrier screening was performed using Multiplexligase-dependent probe ampli cation (MLPA) Probemix P060. homozygous absence of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene. The deletion wasvalidated using MLPA Probemix P021 and Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction. MLPA testing revealed three copies of SMN2 exon 7 and 8. Genetic testing of the spouserevealed three copies of exon 7 in SMN1. Discussion: Carrier testing for reproductive partner of SMA requires SMN1 dosage analysis. If an individual isfound to have at least two SMN1 copies, the probability of being a carrier is approximately 1/670 (mainly taking into consideration the 2% frequency of two SMN1 copies on thesame chromosome). However, in our unique and pretty fortunate couple the risk for SMA disease in the progeny is very low due to the spouses 'extra copy. M. Echar: None. L. Sagi-Dain: None. V. Adir: None. O.

A. 1Montreal Neurological Institute, and Hospital, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, Montreal, QC, Canada, 2Department Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QC, Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which involves loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) in the centralnervous system (CNS). While both upper and lower MNs are affected, some subtypes of lower MNs are resistant to degeneration such as oculomotor nuclei located in themidbrain. The molecular mechanism underlying this dif- ferential vulnerability among MNs is currently unknown.446 J. del PicchiaUsing snRNA-seq to pro le expression in ALS tissues will explain the changes in cell type proportions associated with neurodegeneration. Materials & Methods: Postmortem brain tissues have been collected from 30 tissue samples from oculomotor nucleus, medulla, and spinal cord of ALS cases and healthycontrols. Nuclei isolation and library preparation using the Chromium Single Cell 3 Reagent Kits v2 (10X Genomics) has been performed aiming for 6,000 nuclei per sample. Theaverage sequencing depth per sample was 360M reads using the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). Cellranger software was used for alignment and generation of feature-barcode matrices.The R package Seurat was applied for downstream analysis such as differential gene expression and cell clustering. Preliminary Results: We have identi ed differences in surviving cell types between severely affected and spared regions of the CNS. Further, we identi ed cell population differences and cell-speci c dysregulation of genes between ALS patients and controls, as well as between different regions of the CNS. Conclusions: Knowing the mechanisms underlying tissue- specic neurodegeneration could help understand why some cell types are resistant to degeneration and how it could be possible to simulate this resistance in vulnerable regions.

Kunstmann, Human Genetics, Wuerzburg, Germany Introduction: SPG7 encodes paraplegin, a protein that is of a metalloprotease of the inner mitochondrial mem- brane. Mutations in hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG), a clinically andgenetically heterogeneous group of neurological diseases. Due to the heterogeneity of SPGs and other neuropathies, genetic diagnostics by whole exome sequencing (WES) isbenecial and performed successfully in our laboratory for different (virtual) gene panels. Methods: We present the case of a patient with clinical suspicion of SPG. For molecular diagnosis, we used WES and analysed a (virtual) SPG-panel consistent of 13 genes. To validate one variant 's effect on splicing, we isolated RNA from whole blood and retranscriped it into cDNA, followed by Sanger sequencing. Results: We identi ed two heterozygous variants in SPG7: of uncertain signi cance (c.1779 +5G>C). Prediction tools calculated a decreased probability for the usage of the donor splice site adjacent to the second variant. However, RNA analysis con rmed the usage of a cryptic splice site (c.1779 +42) that leads to the inclusion of 14 amino acids in the protein. The insertion is in frame , but occurs in a functionally important peptidase domain of the protein. Conclusions: In summary, we present the case of a new SPG7 splice site variant, with con rmed effect on RNA splicing. Together with the second variant, it con rms and species the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, WES is a powerful tool to diagnose heterogeneous neurological disorders. A. Zaum: None. F. Zimmer: None. N. Pluta: None. E. Kunstmann: None. S. Rost: None.

Drunat c.*3 +80T>G and c.*211_*212del SMN1 variants had associated with SMN1 cis duplication in the Ashkenazi population (Luo et al. GenetMed. 2014). Our study falls within improvement of genetic counseling for carriers of SMA as already done for Spanish population (Al\u00edas et al. EJHG. 2018). Materials and methods: We used a previously published ddPCR design for the variant c.*3 +80T>G detection (Vidal-Folch et al. Clin Chem. 2018) and a custom madedesign for the variant c.*211_*212del. Carrier status was established after familial studies around SMA cases. Results: See Table ; SMA for Spinal Muscular Atrophy ; *Corresponding to the same individuals ; &27 individuals carried the two variants, the last individual only carried the c.*3+80T>G variant. Conclusions: The variants were absent in 1/0 healthy carriers which corroborate the high association with multi- ple and furthermore cisduplicate SMN1 genes. We can assume that the percentage of variants carriers in 2/0 carriers individual is about 43% in our population which place itself between the average 20% and 46% in Spanish andAshkenazi population respectively(Luo et al. Genet Med. 2014, Al\u00edas et al. EJHG. 2018). The variant study leaded to the estimation of 11.48% of cis duplication carrier in ourgeneral population, allowing us to increase the sensitivity of our SMA carrier detection test.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 447Cis duplication SMN1 variants in SMA patients, in SMA carriers and in general population SMA patients withhomozygous deletion of Total studied (n=315)48 37 37 2 120 64 6 1 C.

Harting2, Zeevi1 1Dor Yeshorim Committee for Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases, Jerusalem, Israel,2Pacic Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, United States,3Dor Yeshorim Committee for Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases, New York, NY, United States Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused primarily by bi-allelic loss of SMN1 exon 7 via deletion and/or gene conversion to SMN2 . Here we show that bi- allelic SMN1 >SMN2 gene conversion presents with mild, or completely absent, disease phenotype. Materials and Methods: A consanguineous couple and 4 children were selected for investigation. Two children wereasymptomatic and the other two children were diagnosed with mild Type 3 SMA (at ages 13 and 28, respectively). For each sample, SMN1 exon7 dosage was measured by qPCR and SMN1 /2 alleles were determined by long read amplicon Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing on the Sequel System (Paci c Biosciences) followed by segregation analysis. Results: The qPCR assay identi ed a carrier state in both parents, non-carrier st ate in one unaffected child, and complete absence of SMN1 exon 7 in 2 affected children and 1 unaffected child. Long-read amplicon analysis identi ed identical genotypes in th e parents, including one normal SMN chromosome (bearing 1 copy of SMN1 and 1 copy of SMN2 ) and one gene conversion SMN chromo- some (bearing one normal copy of SMN2 and one SMN1 >SMN2 gene converted copy). The non-carrier unaffected child was homozygous for the normal SMN chromosome, while the 2 affected children and 1unaffected child were each homozygous for the gene conversion SMN chromosome. Conclusions: SMN1>SMN2 gene conversion, which is fairly common in the general population, was readilydetected with qPCR and long amplicon sequencing. Our results suggest that bi-allelic loss of SMN1 by gene conversion is not necessarily indicative of disease. H. Muallem: None. J. Harting: A.

Despite SMA is a classic monogenic disease, the clinical phenotype of patients varies from the most acute infantile type to arelatively mild chronic juvenile type. Some genetic modi- ers of SMA are already known, such as a type of SMN1 mutation and SMN2 copy number variation. It was shownthat the female SMA phenotype was signi cantly differing from the phenotype of the male patients. The aim of our investigation is to study an association of SMA phenotypewith X-linked genetic and epigenetic factors. Materials and Methods: The study groups consisted of female ( n=103) and male ( n=75) patients with determined SMN2 genotypes. The X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) was done by methyl- specic CAG-genotyping of AR gene. The rs2070169 and rs4339766 of UBA1 were analyzed by RFLP-method. Spearman 's correlation, regression analysis and Mann- Whitney test were used for the statistical analysis. Results: The correlation between the patients 'SMN1 and SMN2 genotypes and SMA phenotypes was stronger in the male group. Skewed XCI was detected in 45.5% of females,these patients signi cantly more often (p <0.05) had differ phenotype than expected. It was demonstrated that rs2070169 and rs4339766 had no signi cant effect on SMA phenotype. Conclusions: It was con rmed that a XCI skewing may influence on SMA phenotype. The skewed XCI in SMA patients lead both to milder and severer phenotypes.448 J. del PicchiaA.

Despite an important role of supervillin in muscle cell physiology has been suggested, no muscular disease associated with SVIL mutations has been described. We here report a new structural myopathy in fourindividuals of two unrelated, consanguineous families caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in SVIL . Material and Methods: Patients were comprehensively investigated clinically, and whole exome sequencing on genomic DNA was performed in all affected individuals. Skeletal muscle biopsies were morphological analyzed byenzyme and immunohistochemical techniques and electron microscopy. Results: Affected patients share a distinctive phenotype that includes a wide neck, anteverted shoulders, and a prominent trapezius muscle together with variable contrac- tures besides further skeletal and mild heart muscleinvolvement. Muscle biopsies of both families demon- strated complete loss of supervillin in muscle tissue by western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. Compre-hensive light and electron microscopical investigations of muscle biopsies showed striking similarities between patients and revealed a structural myopathy with prominentlobulated type 1 bers, myo brillar disintegration and signs of altered proteostasis and impaired autophagy. Conclusions: The results underline the importance of supervillin for the structural integrity of muscle bers in humans and show that recessive loss-of-function mutations inSVIL cause a novel myopathy with distinct histological, ultrastructural and clinical ndings.

P10.68.C Unexpected identi cation of a novel 11 bp deletion mutation in TARDBP causing a slowly progressive autosomal dominant myopathy P. of Medicine, Faculty of Medi- cine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Gent, Belgium, 2Center for Medical Genetics, Gent University Hospital, Gent, Belgium,3Department of Neurology, Ghent Uni- versity Hospital, Gent, Belgium,4Department of Head andAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 449Skin, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Gent, Belgium,5Department of Human Struc- ture and Repair, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Gent, Belgium Background: In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), TDP-43 proteinopathy occurs in 97% of ALS cases and 45% of FTD patients. Furthermore, missense mutations in the C-terminus of TDP-43 are a genetic cause of ALS, emphasizing the crucial role of this protein in the disease 's pathogenesis. Objective: To identify and characterize the genetic cause of an autosomal dominant slowly progressive neurogenic myopathy in a large Belgian family. Methods: Whole exome sequencing and segregation analysis of candidate causal variants. Results: We identi ed a novel causal 11bp deletion in the TARDBP gene (c.1152_1162del) segregating with the disease (2-point LOD-score of 2.4). The disease presented as a slowly progressive neurogenic myopathy with an average age-of-onset of 32 years (range: 18-40) and adisease duration of >45 years. No family members showed classical ALS or FTD pathology. Unlike previously described classical ALS-causing mutations in TARDBP , this mutation causes a frameshift that leads to an entirely novel C-terminus. This region of the protein is key for the formation of TDP-43 aggregates, therefore this novelmutation provides a unique opportunity to dissect the pathogenic role of TDP-43. Conclusions: Since the molecular mechanisms respon- sible for TDP-43 pathology remain fairly unknown, unravelling the biophysical properties of TDP-43 aggrega- tion is of utmost importance.

London, Recessive TTN gene variants cause congenital myopathy (CM) with variable presentation, progression and patholo- gical features. Implementation of Next generation sequen-cing (NGS) has enabled screening of the TTN gene in routine diagnostic testing and is highlighting the consider- able prevalence of this myopathy. The UK Highly Specia-lised Service for CM started TTN analysis in 2016 as part of a panel of genes associated with congenital myopathy. We present results from 99 patients with TTN sequence variants. In most cases other potentially relevant CM genes had been excluded either prior to or at the same time as TTN analysis. 23 patient have homozygous/compound heterozygous(likely) pathogenic variants which were con rmed to be in trans in 13 patients. 21 patients had one or more missense variants of uncertain signi cance in addition to a (likely) pathogenic TTN variant, con rmed to be in trans in 16 patients. A further 13 patients had a heterozygous patho- genic variant but a second causative variant was not iden-tied. The remaining 42 patients had one ( n=18), two (12), or more than three (4) variants of uncertain sig- nicance. The high number of missense variants with insufcient evidence to classify as likely pathogenic, even in patients with strong clinical, pathological and MRI fea- tures, means that functional characterisation of missensevariants is required and further investigation such as tran- scriptome analysis is necessary to identify additional pathogenic variants in in those patients with a single het-erozygous pathogenic variant.

Severalmechanisms were proposed as explanation of gender bias in autoimmune diseases, including skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and X chromosome dosage, sex hor-mones, and variants of genes involved in autoimmunity development. Normally, XCI is a biological event that occurs randomly, and females are thus functional mosaicsfor the X-linked genes. A skewed XCI pattern can lead to an unbalanced expression of certain X-linked alleles, for this reason it has been hypothesized that females may be moreprone to certain diseases. Indeed, a high frequency of skewed XCI pattern has been observed in several auto- immune disorders characterized by female predominance.No data are yet available concerning myasthenia gravis, so that we investigated the XCI pattern in MG females with this autoimmune disease. Materials and Methods: XCI analysis was performed on blood samples of 84 myasthenic women and 111 healthy age-matched female controls. XCI was analysed by humanandrogen receptor (HUMARA) assay. Results: In 72 MG informative patients the frequency of skewed XCI pattern ( 75%) was 35,0 %, which was higher than in healthy controls (14,4%; p=0.002). Furthermore, the prevalence of skewed pattern was observed mostly in youngest patients (<50 years; p=0.008), suggesting an age-independent effect. Conclusions: In this study, we observed preferential XCI in MG female patients, this could suggest a potential role ofthis mechanism in the disease etiology, and in the increased prevalence of autoimmune disorders in females.

Errors in suchtransportation between the organelles can lead to human diseases and implicated in nervous system disorders. Here, we describe 6 patients from 5 unrelated families presentingwith progressive encephalopathy with various degrees of mixed movement disorder, dysphagia, hypotonia, micro- cephaly, and epilepsy. Common genetic was carried out using whole exome sequencing. All affected individuals shared a similar phenotypic features. The resi- dues in the variants are highly conserved among differentspecies and were absent in publicly available databases such as GnomAD. YIF1B is ubiquitously expressed molecule in various tissues including neuronal cells and speci cally in raphe neurons. We performed computational structural analysis of the variants. The modeling predicted that the variants lead to unstructured molecules with loss of func-tion. Our network and functional analyses revealed co- regulation of 171 genes with YIF1B in over 46,000 human RNAseq samples (r 0.9). Our data indicates that disease causing variants in YIF1B in humans lead to a novel neu- rogenetic disorder. Additional studies are required to dis- entangle the precise pathobiological mechanisms of thisautosomal recessive novel disease entity.

The Thrombocytopenia Absent Radius (TAR) syndrome is characterized by hypo-megakaryocyticthrombocytopenia, radius agenesis with thumbs. This study describes ten patients with 1q21.1 CNV including one clinical TAR syndrome. Material and Methods: An array-CGH (Agilent 4x180K) was performed in 1508 patients with different indications. Results: Ten CNVs in 1q21.1 region were identi ed, 6 pathogenic and 4 probably pathogenic. Nine patients showed a variable clinical phenotype, autism spectrumdisorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay and craniofacial dysmorphisms, and a fetus with radius agenesis; three CNVs included the deletion ofRBM8A gene, but only the fetus had clinical TAR. Discussion/Conclusion: The presence of a CNV in the 1q21.1 region could represent a contiguous gene deletion/duplication syndrome (autosomal dominant inheritance) or TAR syndrome (autosomal recessive inheritance).In the fetus with absent radius, the RBM8A gene sequencing revealed no pathogenic coding variants, so further studies will be performed to identify a second variant (intronic or promotor regions) that could explain the TAR phenotype.In1q21.1deletion patients the most common psychiatric manifestation includes internalizing disorders. In 1q21.1- duplications, ASD, attention de cit-hyperactivity disorder and ID are the most common features. Our patients\u00b4 clinical characterization and a comparison of the deletion versusduplication phenotypes will be done in detail. This study highlights the clinical usefulness of aCGH as a rst-tier test for evaluation of patients with neurodevelopmental dis- orders and malformation syndromes. A. Grangeia: None. J. None. M.

C. Sgardioli2, D. Q. Soares3, V. Gil-Da- Silva-Lopes2, C. A. Kim3, M. I. The clinical heterogeneity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) might be caused by complex mechanisms including variants in other regionsof the genome, known as genetic modi ers. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most relevant phenotypes and previous studies have shown that copy number variants(CNVs) outside the 22q11.2 region could play a role in its variable expressivity. However, those described loci account for a small proportion of the variability. Therefore,CNV analysis in new cohorts from different ancestry-based population are a valuable resource to identify a wider range of modi ers. Materials and Methods: We performed SNP-array (CytoScanHD) in 77 Brazilian patients with 22q11.2DS (55 with CHD and 22 with normal cardiac phenotype).Genome-wide CNV analysis was performed by two algorithms (PennCNV and Rawcopy) and the overlapping CNVs were considered for downstream analysis. The CNVscontent was annotated using AnnotSV and compared between patients with and without CHD using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Results: We identi ed 407 CNVs (308 deletions and 99 duplications). CNV-affected genes in patients with CHD were enriched for pathways related to transition metal ionbinding, cytoskeleton and stabilization of membrane potential. Some of these genes have been previously associated to cardiac genes in these pathways could reveal new modi ers to the cardiac phenotype in 22q11.2DS patients. This study will leverage new insights to the understanding of genetic modi ers involved in the expressivity of cardiac alterations support: a disorder of vasculogenesis? C. E. Benson, D. P. Osborn, G. S. Whitley, L. Southgate St George 's University of London, London, United King- dom Introduction: Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS) is a debili- tating disorder of limb, scalp and vascular birth defects, providing a unique window into the regulation of human embryogenesis. AOS is considered to be a disorder ofvasculogenesis; however, this remains to be determined. We have previously identi ed pathogenic mutations of the Rho GTPase regulators DOCK6, abnormal inactiva-tion of Cdc42 and Rac1. Nonetheless, their role in human blood vessel formation requires further exploration. Here, we sought to generate in vitro and in vivo models of Rhodysregulation to investigate the mechanism of vascular disruption in AOS. Materials and Methods: Rho GTPase ) and human vascular smooth muscle cells. Gene expression patterns were assessed by quantitative PCR and whole-mount in situhybridisation. Gene knockdown was conducted using splice-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides. Results: Both genes were expressed in human vascular smooth muscle cells and early stages of vascular develop- ment in zebra sh. Whole-mount in situ hybridisation zebra sh embryos arhgap31 dock6 are localised to the vasculature, ocular and cranial regions, highlighting a correlation with the human phenotype. Furthermore, dock6 morphant embryos displayed vascular defects and microphthalmia, analogous to the clinical features observed in DOCK6 -related AOS. Conclusions: Our preliminary results support a role for ARHGAP31 and DOCK6 during vascular development. Further interrogation of these models will broaden our understanding of Rho GTPase biology in the vasculatureand the mechanisms driving Kucinskas syndrome: the E.

The phenotypic spectrum of 15 previously reported cases range from mild-to-moderate intellectualdecit with microcephaly to a phenotype characterized by severe ventriculomegaly and/or brainstem dysgenesis with intrauterine or neonatal death. Only three children survivedtill childhood. We here report two new ALKKUCS cases from two unrelated consanguineous families.

The second patient was consulted at 9 years of age. She had a history of NICU care due to poor sucking/weak swallowing re flex and car- diac arrest in early neonatal period. Clinical ndings included mild myopathy of the the KIAA1109 gene, segregating with the phenotype, made the diagnosis of ALKKUCS possible, placing the case to the mildest end of the pheno-typic spectrum.

P11.11.B Severe scoliosis in the patient with a novel variant p. Pro237ArgfsTer7 in the WDR45 geneAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 453N. Codina2, L. 1University Clinical Centre of the Republic of Srpska, Banjaluka, Bosnia and Herzegovina,2Quantitative Geno- mic Medicine Laboratories SL, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Mutations in the WDR45 gene have been described as the cause of beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), an X-linked dominant disorderwith brain iron accumulation. It typically presents in early childhood with global developmental delay, seizures and autistic-like behavior. Following an initial static phase,these symptoms progress to dystonia, parkinsonism and dementia in early adulthood. We report a case with a novel pathogenic variant in the WDR45 gene that exhibited anearly progression of symptoms and severe scoliosis which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in BPAN. Case report: A 10-year-old girl is the second child of healthy unrelated parents. At 14 months, developmental delay was noted. She had autistic-like behavior, didn 't walk until the age of 3-year and was mute. Seizures were never noticed but EEG was abnormal. Her condition was stable until the age of 7-year when her cognitive skills furtherdeclined. In that time, scoliosis was noted together with bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. Scoliosis was severely progressive and needed surgical treatment. At theage of 9-year she lost the ability to walk. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous frameshift pathogenic variant in the WDR45 gene p.Pro237ArgfsTer7,veried by Sanger sequencing, that wasn 't present in either parent. No other variants of studied genes associated with scoliosis were identi ed. Conclusions: Our case is a very rare example of BPAN with severe scoliosis that might be due to a novel variant in the WDR45 gene and thus expands the knowledge of thephenotype-genotype correlation of BPAN.

Defective cilia lead to a groupof inherited, monogenic disorders referred as ciliopathies, including disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, poly- cystic kidney disease, Joubert CC2D1A c.1186C>T (p.Arg396*) variant identi ed in our proband left renal cysts, autistic features and Mental MotorRetardation (MMR), his sibling has also austictic features, obesity and MMR, as a candidate ciliopathy gene. To analyze the effect of CC2D1A in ciliogenesis, we utilizedthe frog Xenopus epidermis harbor numerous multiciliated cells that generate head-to-tail polarized fluid flow. When we knocked down CC2D1A in frog Xenopus tropicalis using CRISPR/CAS9 system, and analyzed epidermal flow using Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging, we observed lossof epidermal flow in F0 mutant tadpoles. When we further examined the epidermal surface in these tadpoles using immuno fluorescence, we detected the loss of multiciliated cells. In parallel, we also showed the loss of cilia in C. Elegans CC2D1A knock-out model utilizing the CRISPR/ Cas9 system. Together, this work demonstrates thatCC2D1A is required for proper ciliogenesis in multiciliated cells, providing a plausible mechanism for its role in our patient phenotype. <!--EndFragment--> I. Sakin: None. G. PicchiaP11.15.C Chitayat syndrome: a rare but potentially underdiag- nosed condition ? C. Mueller-Hofstede1, A. Muenster, Germany We report on a ten months old boy, third child of non- consanguineous parents. The pregnancy was uncomplicated without ultrasound abnormalities. Body measurements were in the normal range. Bowed hands and feet with bilateralshortened and ulnar deviated index ngers, additional bone nuclei of digits II / III of both hands and clinodactyly of digiti II, III, IV were noticed. The feet showed bilateralhallux valgus. Neonatal respiratory distress required initi- ally high- flow oxygen therapy. At presentation the boy showed a pectus excavatum and mild facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, short columella) in addition to the above- mentioned abnormalities. The general development wasage-appropriate. Due to the combination of the symptoms Chitayat syndrome has been considered. Sequence analysis identi ed the de novo heterozygous variant c.266A>G (p.(Tyr89Cys)) in the ERF-gene. Chitayat et al. rst described 1993 a patient with hyperphalangism, brachydactyly, bronchomalacia and facial anomalies. Since then, only 6 other patients have been described in literature. In 2016 the recurrent variantc.266A>G (p.(Tyr89Cys)) in the ERF-gene was identi ed as the underlying molecular cause. Heterozygous mutations (predominantely loss-of-func- tion) in the ERF-gene are described in syndromal craniosynostosis 4. The above-mentioned variant has not yet been described in this context. This could indicate, thatthe variant may have a different in fluence on protein function and potentially leads to a gain-of-function. We suggest that the rare condition of Chitayat syndrome should always be considered in children with the combina- tion of characteristic skeletal abnormalities of the hands and feet especially hyperphalangism with respiratory distress.

P11.16.A Isolated familial choanal atresia: new Garde Rennes, Rennes, of Evolution and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences,Faculty of Biology, Medicine, and Health, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Introduction: Loss of function variants in KMT2D can be responsible of Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1). Recently, missense variants in exon 38 or 39 in KMT2D have been found in patients presenting a new phenotype with multiple malformations distinct from KS1, including choanal atresia absence of intellectual disability. Choanal atresia (CA)is disorder characterized by a mem- branous septum between the nose and nasopharynx. CA can occur as an isolated form or in syndromic presentations. Patients and Method: A newborn girl was referred to our medical department because of choanal atresia. Given the fact that 8 members of the family spreading across 3generations had non-syndromic choanal atresia, we decided to perform exome sequencing (ES) in our patient and one cousin, the most distant affected relative. Results: In 2014, ES was rst concluded as negative. Following the publication entitled \"A restricted spectrum of missense KMT2D variants cause a multiple malformationsdisorder distinct from Kabuki syndrome \"(Cuvertino et al., 2020), we interrogated our database for missense variants in exons 38-39 with choanal atresia in the family. One obligate carrier did not present choanal atresia, suggesting incomplete penetrance. Prediction scores are in favor of thepathogenicity and functional analyses have been proposed. Conclusions: Considering these results and the recent literature, we suggest that missense variants in exon 38 ofKMT2D can be responsible of milder phenotypes such as isolated choanal atresia. A.

P11.17.B Chromatinopathies: clinical hypothesis versus molecular diagnosisAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Interactive Dentici, M. Digilio, A. Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Medical Genetics, Bam- bino Ges\u00f9 Pediatric Hospital, Rome, Italy Introduction: Defects of the structural or regulatory com- ponents of cohesin lead to various multisystem malforma- tion syndromes described as \"cohesinopathies \", that share clinical ndings such as distinctive facial features, growth retardation, intellectual disability and limb abnormalities. Moreover, in patients presenting classical and non-classicalfeatures of cohesinopathies were identi ed pathogenic variations in key chromatin-associated factors, genetically different from cohesin, but with overlapping functions, suchas transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modi cations; these conditions could be con- sidered part of a larger disease family categorized as\"chromatinopathies \". Materials and Methods: Between 2017 and 2018, 40 cohesinopathies/chromatinopathies patients carrying hetero-zygous pathogenic variants have been diagnosed at the Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children Hospital, with initial clinical hypothesis of KBG syndrome, CHARGE association,Kabuki syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Cofn-Siris syndrome. A custom Chromatinopathies NGS panel was used to analyze genes associated with thesesyndromes. Results: In 22.5% of cases molecular defects causing phenotypic conditions different from the initial clinicalhypothesis were identi ed in other genes coding for cohesin, transcriptional regulators, chromatin-associated protein complex among chromatin disorders, clinical diagnosis of these patients isoften challenging or rather impossible without genetic evidence. In our cohort, the high rate of positive cases not matching with the rst clinical suspect suggests that broad spectrum molecular analysis is crucial to reach accurate diagnosis and will probably led to the identi cation of additional genotype-phenotype associations.

Parents of children with such a deletion search the internet and unite in international social media platforms. A successful collaboration with theChromosome 6 Facebook group allowed us to collect data of 109 newly identi ed individuals. Families can sign up for the study via the secured project 's website by uploading the proband 's array report. Phenotype data is collected directly from the individuals or parents via an online multilingual questionnaire. Literaturecase reports are added to the database using the same questionnaire. Up till January 2020 this resulted in a total of 250 individuals. Subgroups are made based on the predicted haploinsuf - ciency genes within the deletions, leading to detailed phenotype descriptions for 18 subgroups thus far. Gastroesophageal re flux, trachea/laryngo/bronchomala- cia, congenital heart defects, cerebral defects, seizures and vision and respiratory problems are predominant in6q14.2q15 deletions. In contrast, 6q11q14.1 deletions present less severe clinical characteristics. Deletions including the gene TAB2 (6q25.1) are char- acterized by facial dysmorphisms, short stature, heart defects and connective tissue problems and resemble a Noonan-like syndrome. Within the 6q25.2q25.3 region ARID1B plays a promi- nent role, resulting in a Cof n-Siris syndrome phenotype when deleted. Terminal 6q26q27 deletions are characterised by micro- cephaly, hypotonia, balance problems, vision problems, seizures and brain abnormalities. Deletions includingPARK2 presented with more severe developmental delay. In conclusion, social media are instrumental in collecting large numbers of detailed data on rare chromosomeaberrations, resulting in a more precise description of the phenotypic spectrum. A.

Ciliary dysfunction leads to rare recessive multiorgan disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies, which have overlapping genotype-phenotype correlations, makingaccurate diagnosis challenging. Our aim is to develop a novel cell-based functional assay to improve accurate diagnosis of ciliopathies on the basis of the underlyingmechanism of disease. Materials and Methods: Skin- broblasts from 10 ciliopathy patients (from 3 different subgroups) and 8controls were cultured in vitro and immuno fluorescence was applied to determine cilium phenotype parameters; 1) ciliogenesis, based on presence or absence of ciliummarkers, 2) cilium length, measured by the combined signal of an axonemal and a cilium membrane marker, and 3) intra flagellar transport (IFT), quanti ed by the area of the ciliary tip using the IFT88 signal. Results: Cilium phenotypic data from skin- broblasts of controls comparable and reproducible results:88% were ciliated, the ciliary tip area \u00b1 0.02m 2. Analysis of the cilium phenotype in the 10 patients for three clinical subgroups not only showed signicant differences in cilium length and IFT results, but also allowed to distinguish the three ciliopathy subgroupsfrom one another. Conclusions: In summary, standardized analysis of the cilium phenotype can lead to identi able clusters for different ciliopathies. Therefore, we believe that standar- dized tests based on cilium phenotypic data can provide additional proof for conclusive diagnosis of ciliopathies,which is essential in routine diagnostic care.M.M.

SNVs were in the coding region/nearby intron suggesting our high diagnostic rate may be related to a more complete coverage of WGS versus exome, and/or ourintertwined bioinformatics and clinical prioritization of variants. The diagnosis changed the management of all positive cases, including referral to palliative cures(RRM2B ; mtDNA depletion syndrome), referral for a spe- cic follow-up, or cancer surveillance program ( ASXL1 ). We provided a correct recurrence risk for future pregnanciesfor parents, including a consanguineous couple with a de novo causative variant in their child. In conclusion, we show how WGS can dramatically increase our ability toreach a genetic diagnosis in undiagnosed cases.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 457F.

Y\u00fcr\u00fcr Kutlay Ankara University School of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome (Liehr et al.,2013). Here, we describe a complex sSMC derived from a maternal translocation between chromosomes 19p and 22q in a patient with intellectual disability and short stature. Materials and Methods: G-banding, FISH, and micro- array were performed in order to de ne sSMC. Results: The patient presented with a complex sSMC derived from a 3:1 segregation of a maternal balanced t (19;22)(p13;q11) reciprocal translocation and resulting in tertiary trisomy of 19p13.3 and 22q11.1q11.21. Conclusions: Genotype-phenotype correlation and assigning a speci c feature to an aberration are often difcult in cases with combined partial trisomies. Besides, numerical and structural abnormalities involving chromo- some 19 is relatively rare compared to other chromosomes. In comparison to patients with similar aberrations, ourpatient showed a phenotype similar to 19p13.3 duplication, regarding intellectual disability and growth retardation (Orellana et al., 2015). This is the rst complex sSMC originating from chromosome 19 and 22. Functional analysis of the genes in these regions may provide a better explanation about the gene-dosage effects on the phenotype.

Clinical heterogeneity is illustrated byvariable severity and atypical cases overlapping with some other syndromes. Mutations in 6 genes from the cohesin results from a retrospective study of 202 cases referred between 2011 and 2019. Methods: Clinical data were reviewed by an expert clinician before molecular testing. Phenotypes were classi- ed as typical/mild/atypical CdLS or another diagnosis. We applied a clinical score for all suspected CdLS cases, andcompared values per molecular outcome and phenotype. A gene panel sequencing assessed 5/6 CdLS and 17 differential diagnoses genes (~700x depth of coverage onaverage). Results: Differential diagnoses were suspected for 23 individuals. CdLS was suspected for 179 individuals: 66typical, 40 mild and 73 atypical. Molecular testing identi ed a (likely) pathogenic variant for typical rming for 73 of them. A differential diagnosis was identi ed for 6 atypical individuals. We identi ed 11 mosaic mutations with variable phenotypes; 9 were detected in saliva and were undetectable in blood. Clinical scores were signi cantly higher for typical individuals and for pathogenic variants carriers. Conclusions: Applying deep gene panel sequencing from other tissues than blood is an effective strategy for typical CdLS given the number of mosaics, while atypicalphenotypes could be by rst-tier sequencing.

This is of particular interest for Cor- nelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), in which heterogeneity in clinical presentation and phenotype overlap with differentsyndromes, and the still widely unknown molecular pathomechanisms makes its diagnosis challenging for pae- diatricians. Here, we performed a phenotypic study on acohort of 49 individuals harbouring causative variants in known CdLS genes in order to evaluate Face2Gene utility and sensitivity in the clinical diagnosis of CdLS. Material and Methods: We analysed the frontal images of all individuals using Face2Gene technology. All individuals with CdLS were subjected to molecular analysisby next generation sequencing. The CdLS clinical score was computed by trained physicians according to the interna- tional consensus criteria of CdLS. Results: Based on the pro le images of patients, a diagnosis of CdLS was within the top ve predicted syndromes for 97.9% of our cases and even listed as rst prediction for 83.7%. The age of patients did not seem to affect the prediction accuracy, whereas our results indicate a correlation between the clinical score and affected genes.Furthermore, each gene presents a different pattern recognition that may be used to develop new neural networks with the goal of separating different geneticsubtypes in CdLS.Conclusions: Overall, we conclude that computer- assisted image analysis based on deep learning could support the clinical diagnosis of CdLS.

Five genes have been identi ed but only 4% of cases are associated with HDAC8 , in contrast to 60% associated with NIPBL gene. Variants in HDAC8 present themselves with phenotypical differences from the classical-CdLS, therefore having no evident clinical diag- nose. In the past 3 years, with whole exome sequencing(WES), we identi ed three cases of HDAC8 CdLS, including a long-term accompanied, yet undiagnosed, 20 year old girl. Cases report: Three girls were studied due to develop- ment disorder and multiple dysmorphologies not resem- bling of any particular syndrome. After initial inconclusiveanalysis, further testing with WES found that each one presented a variant in the HDAC8 gene, one already known and classi ed as pathogenic, and two unknown classi ed as likely pathogenic.

Although TUBGCP2 muta- tions were recently reported in families with developmental delay, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, epilepsy,460 J. del Picchiamicrocephaly and lissencephaly spectrum changes, we for therst time investigated the cellular defects caused by GCP2 mutations in patient broblasts by immunocyto- chemical, proteomic and in silico analyses. We studied the localization of some -TuRC components and associated proteins in control and patient broblasts in interphase and in mitosis by immuno fluorescence, and the levels of the GCP2 protein along the cell cycle. Our data suggested that the localization of -TuRC complex was perturbed in mitosis but down-regulated proteins, which were enriched fortubulin and cytoskeletal proteins that play role in neurode- velopment. In summary, we describe two siblings carrying a novel homozygous TUBGCP2 variant with dysmorphicsigns, severe developmental delay and epilepsy, and show that, in addition to a neuronal migration defect, brainstem atrophy and disturbed myelination are also associated withTUBGCP2 mutations, explaining the variable clinical and imaging ndings. *TUBITAK research grant 216S771, Newton A.

Craniosynostosis may occur in an isolated setting or as part of a syndrome. FGFR2 ,FGFR3 ,FGFR1 ,TWIST1 and EFNB genes are major causative genes of genetic syndromes with craniosynostosis. Our aim was to investi- gate the clinical and genetic aspects for the patientsrecorded with craniosynostosis in the les of the Iasi Regional Medical Genetics Center for the last 15 years. For each case we have studied clinical features to highlight the evocative signs for diagnosis and to establish the correlation with the laboratory results. In all patients we applied ima- gistic investigations (RX or CT) that was concordant withcraniosynostosis types. We identi ed 99 patients suspected for craniosynostosis. From these, 84 presented an isolated form of craniosynostosis, while 15 patients had a syndromicform (Apert, Saethre-Chotzen, Crouzon, Carpenter syn- dromes). We with syndromic forms of craniosynostosis by MLPA analysis using kit P064 andP080 (MRC Holland \u00ae). We identi ed the mutation in TWIST1 gene associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in 4 patients. Another mutation was detected in FGFR2 gene, being discovered in a case of Apert syndrome. In familial cases we accorded genetic counselling in concordance with results of molecular analyses and we discussed the possi-bility of surgical therapy. Our cases illustrate the genetic heterogeneity among cranyosinostosis syndromes. Mole- cular diagnosis is very important for an adequate geneticcounseling and guidance for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis. M. Danila: None. M. Tonu: None. M. Panzaru: None. L.

OC15 showed asymmetrical skeletal defects and syndac-tyly, while OC15b presented with a more severe micro- cephaly and semilobal holoprosencephaly. All fourprogenitors were related (the two mothers being sisters and the two fathers being cousins once removed). Additionally, OC15 parents were consanguineous (again cousins once removed). Material and Methods: WES analysis of patient OC15 was performed as a singleton inside the URD-Cat project.The OC15b trio was sequenced at the National Center of Genomic Analyses (CNAG; Barcelona, Spain). Selected variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: We did not identify any shared variant that could be associated with the disease. Instead, each patient presented a de novo heterozygous variant in a differentgene. OC15 carried a nonsense mutation in PORCN (p. Arg95*), a gene responsible for Goltz-Gorlin syndrome, while OC15b carried an indel mutation in ZIC2 leading to the substitution of 3 residues by a proline (p.His404_- Ser406delinsPro). Autosomal dominant mutations in ZIC2 have been associated with holoprosencephaly 5. Bothvariants are absent in the general population and are predicted to be pathogenic. Conclusions: These two de novo heterozygous variants identi ed in the two patients seem to explain the major phenotypic alterations of each particular case, instead of a homozygous variant that would be expected by None.

The phenotype in our patient resembles two previously reported patients with GLOW ( Global developmental delay, Lung cysts, Overgrowth and Wilms tumor)syndrome harboring mosaic hotspot mutations in theRNase IIIb domain. His symptoms support novel results from integrated genetic analysis and in vitro cell experi- ments where RNase IIIa tions involving the catalytic core, causing phenotype commonalities with tissue speci c tumors. In addition, his symptoms with macrocephaly, polydactyly, multiple nevi, and intellectual disability resemble phenotypes seen in other overgrowth syndromes that activate PI3K/AKT/mTORsignaling. In conclusion, we show that germline mutation p.Ser1344Leu in the RNase IIIa domain ofDICER1 is compatible with life and causes a GLOW syndrome-like phenotype through a novel pathogenic mechanism in the RNase IIIa domain.

The aim of this study is to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) in these individuals to search for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) related to the phenotype. Methods: We selected 36 individuals with CNVs classi ed as VOUS, from a group of 228 individuals presenting MCA and (or) ID/DD previously investigated by Chromosomal Micorarray Analysis. To date, WES wasperformed for 18 individuals using the Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment V5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform(Illumina, San Diego, CA, of them the clinical phenotype was compatible with the mutations found. In addition, a class IV, likely pathogenic SNV was found in one individual ( FOXL2 ), and SNVs classi ed as VOUS SOX11 andNSDHL; ASXL2; TGFBR1) , one of them also with a pathogenic variant in another gene. None of the SNVs found matched the CNVs classi ed as VOUS. Conclusions: Since the (likely) pathogenic SNVs found in 5/18 (28%) individuals explain the clinical phenotype, we conclude that the CNVs classi ed as VOUS were rare ndings, with Financial support: CAPES, FAPESP (#2018/08890-9) FAEPEX-Unicamp. - An Australian case series S.

The pre- valence is currently unknown, with 110 affected individuals reported in the literature. MFDM is an important differential for other multiple congenital malformation syndromes suchas CHARGE syndrome. Materials and methods: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using Pubmed. A proforma wasdevised to capture the demographic, clinical and genetic variables of identi ed patients. Other clinical genetic services in Australia were contacted to contribute. Results: Four patients with EFTUD2 related MFDM were identi ed at two Australian centres. Two patients were monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twins. One twindied secondary to complications of MFDM in the rst year of life, his surviving twin was recently reviewed at age 7 years. Two patients were last reviewed aged 15 and 30years respectively. Conclusions: This case series contributes further to the literature, allowing for greater expansion of the knownphenotype for this rare congenital multiple malformation syndrome. In particular, our report of MCMA twins of varying clinical manifestations, supports the view that whileMFDM is highly penetrant, it is variably expressive. Our case series may further guide surveillance and management of this small, but highly diverse, patient group. S. O 'Sullivan: None. J. McGaughran: None. L. McGregor: None. P11.37.A Genome wide methylation pro ling, EpiSign, as a diagnostic test M. Alders 1, P. Henneman1, Health Sciences Centre, London, ON, Canada,3Western University, London, ON, Canada A growing number of neurodevelopmental syndromes are shown to have unique genomic DNA methylation pro les. These episignatures can be used to diagnose patients with such syndromes. We have recently implemented genomewide methylation pro ling as a diagnostic test in our laboratory. This test, named EpiSign(v1), is able to recog- nize 22 syndromes, 14 of which are syndromes with c episignatures, (for example for Kabuki syndrome, BAFo- pathies and Cornelia de Lange syndrome), 6 are imprinting disorders and 2 are repeat expansion disorders. Validationof the test was based on 38 positive samples (with known pathogenic variant) and 24 negative controls. All sampleswere called correctly provided that the DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and there was no low mosaicism for the pathogenic variant. Reasons for requesting an EpiSign clinical test were: the presence of a variant of unknown clinical signi cance, clinical diagnosis without molecular conrmation, or as a test complementary to WES/WGS, without a prior (suspected) diagnosis. In approximately 40% of cases with a suspected (VUS present) or clinical diagnosis, EpiSign was able to con rm this diagnosis. This shows that EpiSign is a powerful new diagnostic tool, in particular for patients for whom conventional genetic test- ing was inconclusive. In March 2020 an updated version ofEpiSign will be available (EpiSignv2), allowing diagnosis of an additional 23 syndromes (45 in total).

Most patients did not achieve unassisted sitting or walking, had no speech and were not able to use their hands purposefully. For years,targeted sequencing of FOXG1 gene has only been pre- scribed in such severe cases and did not permit to describe the full clinical spectrum associated with FOXG1 variants. The advent of exome/genome sequencing now permits to diagnose unbiased clinical presentations. Methods : A collaborative call was sent through the ERN-ITHACA, in order to gather detailed clinical cases with a heterozygous FOXG1 variant associated with a mild phenotype, de ned as a patients who could walk unassisted and/or acquire speech. Results : Eight patients were collected from different European countries, all carrying a pathogenic or likelypathogenic de novo missense FOXG1 variant, the majority being located in the forkhead conserved site 1. Patients usually presented with non-speci c ID, distinct from the congenital Rett variant, microcephaly and epilepsy being rarely associated. Conclusion : These ndings corroborate with the recent genotype-phenotype analysis (Mitter et al., 2017) proposing to delineate 5 different FOXG1 groups. Milder in the forkhead conserved site.

We hypothesized that genome sequencing (GS) has high potential to diagnose childrenwith medical complexity, and that cohorts of these children are enriched for novel genetic disorders. Screening 545 children with medical complexity from a Complex Care Program yielded 143 children suspected of an undiagnosed genetic condition, despite having under- gone an average of four genetic tests per proband. 49/143were evaluated through clinical genetic assessments and found to be phenotypically complex, with a median of 24 Human Phenotype Ontology terms/patient. Short read GSwas performed on these 49 probands, including 2 quartets, 40 trios, and 3 dyads. Despite prior genetic testing, GS yielded a new molecular diagnosis for 15/49 probands (31%). The majority of diagnostic variants were sequence level variants, although an exonic duplication causing Kabuki syndrome found byGS escaped detection by CMA, ES, or MLPA analysis. Of note, only three autosomal recessive disorders were identi ed and >90% (11/12) of the dominant and X- linked disorders identi ed by GS were caused by de novo mutations. The majority of disorders (9/15) were ultra rare (<25 reported cases), including three associated with noveldisease genes FBXW7, H3F3B, and RAC3. Importantly, using DECIPHER, Matchmaker Exchange, and ClinVar, similarly affected individuals were rapidly identi ed around the globe. Our results suggest that trio-based genome sequencing is a high yield testing strategy for this patient population,which appears to be enriched for de novo mutations, ultra- rare disorders and novel genetic syndromes.

Some skeletal problems without mesomelic dysplasia and urogenital abnormalitieshave been reported in this condition. However, our patient did not have RUSAT. This may be due to the different functional effects of these variants, although they arelocated in the same protein domain (homeodomain).

Array-negative single hetero-zygous carriers are currently undergoing RNA analysis to investigate the presence of cryptic variants affectingsplicing. In 137 probands, no pathogenic variants were identi ed. Yet, most of them have been tested only for a subset of known genes, and WES is in progress. Clinical evaluation of JS-mutated cases con rmed strong gene- phenotype correlates for some major genes correlates emerge for CC2D2A and KIAA0586. These ndings have major implications for prognosis and counselling of JS families. V. Serpieri: None. S. Nuovo: None. A. Micalizzi: None. F. D'Abrusco: None. P. Accorsi: None. R. Battini: None. F.

P11.47.B Description of the molecular and phenotypic spectrum of Kabuki syndrome in 73 Chinese patients Y. Wang , Y. Shen, J. Wang, X. Wang Shanghai Children 's Medical Center, Shanghai, China, China. <META NAME =\"author\" CONTENT =\" \">Introduction: To retrospective analysis the clinical phenotypes and genotypes of Kabuki syndrome patientsdiagnosed in a single center. Meanwhile, the clinical dataof Chinese KS patients reported in the previous literature were summarized. To explore the characteristics of phenotypeand genotype of Chinese KS patients. Materials and Method: The objects who were referred to Shanghai Children 's Medical Center from July 2017 to December 2019 diagnosed with KS were included, and Chinese KS patients reported in the database were collected. The clinical phenotypes Chinese KS patients were compared with non-Chinese KS patients to further analyze and summarize the characteristics of their phenotype and genotype. Results: A total of Chinese KS patients include 32 cases diagnosed byour hospital and 41 reported cases in the database. By comparing the clinical phenotypes of Chinese KS patients with non-Chinese KS patients, we found that the incidenceof some facial features was higher in Chinese KS patients, but congenital heart disease, cleft palate, infant nger pad and vision abnormality was lower. The difference of theabove phenotypic incidence was statistically signi cant. Sixty- ve pathogenic mutations of KMT2D gene, 7Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 467pathogenic mutations of KDM6A gene and 1 copy number mutation of KDM6A gene were found. Conclusions: Through this study, we found that the incidence of several phenotypes in Chinese KS patients vs non-Chinese KS patients was statistically signi cant.

P11.49.A Clinical features and identi cation of mutation spectrum in 23 Turkish children with Kabuki syndrome E. Usluer 1,G .Y Turkey,2Bezmialem Vakif University, Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinct facies (long palpebral ssures with eversion of the lateral portion of the lower eyelid and large ears), persistent fetal nger pads and intellectual disability (ID). It is caused by heterozygous mutations in KMT2D (56-75%) or KDM6A (3-8%) genes. We investigated clinical and molecular ndings of 23 patients diagnosed with KS. Methods: Twenty-three patients clinically were enrolled. Exons and exon-intron boundaries of KMT2D andKDM6A were studied by Sanger sequencing method. Results: We detected different pathogenic mutations ( ve missense, four nonsense, ve small deletion, one small insertion, one splicing) in KMT2D gene in 16 patients (69.6%), seven of them were novel. None of patients had amutation in KDM6A gene. All of the patients had typical facial features, fetal nger pads and ID (6 severe, 17 mild). The patients also had short stature (11/23), renal anomalies (11/23),congenital heart defects (CHD) (1 1/23), cleft palate (5/23), epilepsy abnormal brain MRI (6/23) d premature thelarche Conclusions: Up to date 829 different mutations in KMT2D gene have been reported. This study also revealed that novel mutations are common in KMT2D gene. The absence of mutations in 30.4% of patients points genetic heterogeneity and the need to investigate indels and new candidate genes. In addition, while patients with KMT2D gene mutations have CHD and renal abnormalities, the absence of those without mutations supports the effect of KMT2D gene on heart and kidney development. E.

Dentici1, Digilio1 1Laboratory Medical Medical Pediatric Cardiology, Endocrinology Units andScienti c Rectorate, Bambino Sapienza University, KBG syndrome (MIM #148050) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by develop-mental delay, intellectual disability, distinct craniofacial anomalies, macrodontia of permanent upper central inci- sors, skeletal abnormalities and short stature. Moleculardefect results from loss of function mutations or deletions of theANKRD11 gene, encoding for an inhibitor of ligand- dependent transcriptional activation. Materials and Methods: KBG patients were analized with NGS Cohesinopathies gene panel while clinical exome sequencing was performed to study patients with a likelyassociation of neuro bromatosis. Common clinical features have been reviewed together with unusual ndings, clinical expression in the rst years of life and distinctive associations. Results: This single-center study reports the clinical features of 31 KBG patients of Bambino Ges\u00f9 ChildrenHospital: 28 with ANKRD11 pathogenic variants and 3 with 16q24 deletions. In addition to ANKRD11 causative mutation, pathogenic NF1 variants have been found in two patients. Unusual manifestations emerging from present series include juvenile idiopathic arthritis, dysfunctional dysphonia, multiple dental agenesis, idiopathic and endothelial polymorphic dystro- phy. Facial clinical markers suggesting KBG syndromebefore 6 years of age include ocular and mouth conforma- tion, wide eyebrows, synophrys, long black eyelashes, long philtrum and thin upper lip. Conclusions: The spectrum of clinical features in KBG is wide. It is likely that uncommon clinical presentation and overlapping features in patients with multiple variants areresponsible for underdiagnosis in KBG syndrome. Improved knowledge about typical and atypical symptoms is useful for clinical management of this disorder. M. Gnazzo: None. F. Lepri: None. M. Dentici: None. R. Capolino: None. E. Pisaneschi: None.

P11.52.A Pathogenic variant in KLHL11 in six individuals a family with lichen planus, ungueal hypoplasia andcancer. \u00bfA Nevado1, J. Fort2, Spain,2Institute Research in Biomedicine, Barcelona, Spain,3Dermatology Department - Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain,4Centro Nacional de Biotecnolog\u00eda, Madrid, Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas Alberto Sols, Madrid, Spain Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic in flammatory disorder that affects the skin, oral mucosa and hair. The lesions of the LP tend to chronify and sometimes can lead to malignancyneoplasias. LP can be associated with several systemic disorders such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. We here present a 2-generation familywith six affected members with LP, nail dystrophy and in two of them, carcinoma of the tongue and other localiza- tions, with several members of the families developingcancer. Clinical features segregates along the family, sug- gesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Thus, whole exome sequencing was performed in all availablemembers of the family (including healthy and affected members), allowing to identify a heterozygous missense variant in KLHL11 that segregates with the phenotype. This variant is not present in the control population databases. In addition, there is no disease associated with KLHL11 yet. KLHL11 belongs to the KELCH superfamily -42 genesdescribed -, and encoded for a protein that have a BTB/ POZ, BACK ve KELCH domains. The BTB/POZ domain is involved in protein-protein binding and dimerization. TheBACK domain does not have a known function and the KELCH motifs create a tertiary structure of -helix which is involved in extracellular functions, cellular integrity andprotein binding. Kelch proteins acts as homodimer, and the variant detected it is suspected to impair this dimerization. It's the rst time that a KLHL11 is associated with lichen planus and neoplasia. Functional assays are necessary to conrm the pathogenic mechanism. J. Tenorio: None. J. Nevado: None. J. Fort: None. M. Feito: None. V. Mart\u00ednez-Glez: None. R. De Lucas:None. A.

The phenotype includes severe intellectual disability, distinctive but subtle facial features, hypotonia, variable congenital malformations and persistently elevatedalkaline phosphatase (ALP). Methods: The search for an unidenti ed syndrome causing the above clinical features led to the clinicalidenti cation of a case of MS at Tygerberg Academic Hospital. This was assisted by Face2Gene phenotype matching and con rmed by elevated ALP. detected a homozygous candidate variant (PGAP3: c.557G>C, p.Arg186Thr). A case series was assembled by retrospective and prospective case nding at three South African sites using database searches, Face2- Gene phenotype matching, and/or ALP levels and Sanger sequencing for the candidate variant. Results: Nine clinical cases were identi ed and Sanger sequencing could be performed on 7, all proved homo- zygous for the candidate variant. The likely pathogenicvariant is absent from population databases, affects a highly conserved amino acid and is predicted damaging/deleter- ious. Observed clinical features in all included severeintellectual disability, absent speech, hypotonia and cleft palate in (5/9) (56%). ALP levels were include hypertelorism,long palpebral ssures, broad nasal tip and tented upper lip. Conclusion: A previously undiagnosed syndrome was identi ed in an indigenous South African population, with computer-assisted syndromology being instrumental. We describe 9 cases of MS and their genetic basis. The common homozygous variant in PGAP3 , in the absence of consanguinity, suggests genetic drift and investigation is ongoing.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 469H.

P11.54.C De novo variants in MCF2L are associated with congenital blindness, hearing loss, microcephaly, ID and autism D. J. Smits , L. Donker Kaat, R. Schot, M. Wilke, M. van Slegtenhorst, G. M. S. Mancini Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Nether- lands Introduction: MCF2L encodes for the Dbs protein guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rho- GEF). Rho-GEFs accelerate the exchange activity of Rho GTPases and thereby regulate several growth related pro- cesses. MCF2L interacts with RAC1 via its plekstrinhomology domain, and thereby in turn activates RHOA. RAC1 activating mutations have been associated with megalencephaly and RHOA mosaic postzygotic inactivat-ing variants have been syndrome with asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy, microphthalmia or other ocular,dental and skeletal anomalies. Previously, GWAS studies pointed to MCF2L as locus for osteoarthritis. Results: We identi ed heterozygous de novo missense variants in the spectrin-like repeat domain of MCF2L in two unrelated boys. They presented with nearly identical and recognizable phenotypic features including mildfacial dysmorphisms, microphthalmia with persistent hyperplastic primary , detach- ment, mild hearing loss, microcephaly, cognitive autism, epilepsy, pyramidal signs and congenital thyroid insuf ciency. Brain MRI in one child (10 years of age) showed focal cortical dysplasia of the insula, oneperiventricular nodula r heterotopia and calci cations. In suggest a causal implication for the MCF2L variants, which enlarge the broad clinical spectrum of mutations in proteins involved in regulation of Rho-protein signalling and emphasize the importance of this pathway in neurodevelop-mental disorders.

Following our recent pilot of 30families (PMID:31625567), we have now sequenced the whole genomes of a further 336 individuals (including 115 patients) from 87 families with various conditions, includ-ing: disorders. We identi ed novel causative mutations in known disease genes in 34 families (40.2%), including 29 SNVs/indels and 5 structural variants. Nota-bly, we discovered a complex rearrangement (tandem duplication and deletion) affecting exons 1-6 of IRF6 in three siblings with Popliteal pterygium syndrome, con-rmed by de novo local re-assembly of WGS reads and PCR. For another 15 families, we identi ed putatively damaging variants in novel candidate genes, e.g. a missensevariant in the CPSG4 shared by two siblings with severe hypotonia, dysmorphic features and myoclonic encephalo- pathy with seizures. Homozygous sh we generated by CRISPR displayed highly similar phenotypes, prompting deeper functional studies to elucidate gene mechanism. The Qatari Mendelian program continues to enroll 2-4 familiesper week, consented for sample/data sharing, thus creating an international genomic and phenotypic resource for mutation matching and gene discovery from the globallyunder-represented greater Middle Eastern populations.

Morphological characteristics were assessed by an expert(RCH) blinded to the molecular data. Variants were plotted on 3D protein domains using iCn3D software. Results: Variants clustered closely around the Zinc binding residues of two Zinc nger domains (ZZ and TAZ2) and within the (ID4) of CBP/p300. All variants werepredicted to disturb local protein structure and therefore likely the function of CBP/p300. By evaluating morpholo- gical and physical features, we discerned one clearlydelineated and likely subtypes. Conclusions: Variants recognisable MKHK subtype. Although numbersare still small, three other possible subtypes can be discerned in ZZ and two regions within TAZ2. LAM was funded by the Janivo Foundation and Emma Children 's Hospital Foundation.

Bartuli osteodysplastic primordial dwar sm (MOPD) type II is a rare disorder characterized by skeletal dysplasia, severe proportionate short stature, insulin resis-tance and cerebrovascular abnormalities including cerebral aneurysms and moyamoya disease. MOPD type II is caused by mutations in the pericentrin (PCNT) gene, whichencodes a protein involved in centrosomes function. We report a 2 year old girl affected by MOPD type II caused by two compound heterozygous loss of-functionvariants in PCNT gene, of which one is a novel variant (c.5304delT; p.Gly1769AlafsTer34). The patient presented atypical brain MRI ndings consistent with pachygyria. This was con rmed by morphometric analysis of cortical thickness and gyri cation index by comparing MRI data of the patient with a group of 8 age-matched healthy controls.The statistical analysis revealed a signi cant and diffuse increase of cortical thickness with an anterior predominant pattern and diffuse reduced gyri cation (p< 0.05). These ndings provide new evidences to the emergent concept that malformations of cortical development are complex disorders and that new genetic ndings contribute to the fading of classi cation borders.

The charts for males and females aged from 0 to16 years were constructed using a total of 2,865 measure- ments of 99 MWS patients, of different ancestries. The data were collected through collaboration with the Italian MWSassociation (AIMW) and the MWS Foundation. To model the growth charts, the GAMLSS package for the R statis- tical program was used. Height, weight, body mass index(BMI) and occipito-frontal circumference (OFC) were compared to healthy children using CDC growth charts. In472 J. del Picchianewborns, weight and length were distributed as in the general population, while head circumference was slighlty smaller. Weight and height distribution was slightly shifted to lower values than the general population until the age of 7, when the difference increased. BMI distribution was almost similar to that of the non- affected children until theage of 7, then values in the general population increase rapidly and in MWS children increase with a less steep slope. Microcephaly develops gradually in infancy, not allchildren were microcephalic and the head circumference was often between the 3 rdand the 10thcentile. These charts contribute to the understanding of the natural history ofMWS and should assist pediatricians and other caregivers in providing optimal care to MWS individuals with problems related to physical growth.

Giorgi three-generation family with and renal agenesis: a new candidate genein Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome M. K. e1, con-genital anomaly characterised with 46,XX karyotype. Prevalence is 1 in5,000 females. MRKH syndrome is often associated with extragenital malformations (type 2), predominantly kidney anomalies such as renal agenesis. The aetiology remains unknown, however rare reports of familial occurrence suggest a genetic cause following autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Material and Methods: We investigated a unique three- generation family with two female cousins with type 2 MRKH syndrome including unilateral renal agenesis andtwo deceased male relatives with renal agenesis. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of genomic DNA from eight family members. Results: We identi ed a novel likely pathogenic (CADD =33) c.705G>T missense variant in GREB1L - a gene recently identi ed as a novel cause of bilateral renal agenesis. Previous literature include several cases of bilateral renal agenesis in female foetuses also having uterus agenesis, which supports GREB1L as an important gene in both kidney and female genital tract development. The missense variant was con rmed in all affected family members, however, the variant was vertically transmittedthrough two unaffected women suggesting incomplete penetrance following a parent-origin-speci c manner. Conclusions: We suggest GREB1L as a novel and promising candidate gene in MRKH syndrome aetiology, especially in patients with type 2 MRKH syndrome also having kidney abnormalities. The incomplete penetranceobserved in our family could be explained by genomic imprinting and is currently subject to further investigation. M.K. Herlin: None. A.T. H\u00f8jland: None.

Variant pathogenicity assessment by familial co-segregation analysis for wasAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 473carried out when necessary. According to the ACMG-AMP guidelines (2015), variants were classi ed as classes 1 to 5. Fetal karyotypes were normal. Results: Likely pathogenic (class 4) and pathogenic (class 5) variants were identi ed in 14 (23%) out of the 60 cases. The variants were found in 13 different uncertain signi cance (class 3) were detected in 6 cases (10%). No variants (class 3-5) were identi ed in a total of 40 fetuses (67%). Our ndings show a strong correlation between the detection rate of causative mutations and the complexity of the fetal phenotype. Conclusions: SCES facilitates the identi cation of genetic causes with high diagnostic yield and should be considered for molecular genetic diagnosis in cases of complex fetal malformations. This unique challenge ofexome-based prenatal diagnostics requires a team of prenatal and human genetic specialists. K. Gahle: None. M. Shoukier: None. C. Daumer-Haas: None. C. Bagowski: None. N.

Traeger- Synodinos National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece Introduction: Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder belonging to a group of developmental disorders called RASopathies with overlapping features and multiple causative genes. The variable clinical phenotypeassociated with NS and Noonan-like disorders is partly due to genetic heterogeneity, whereby mutations in many genes may result in different phenotypic expression. In this studywe present the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of NS illustrated by the analysis of 15 patients. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients with pheno- typic characteristics of NS were referred to the Laboratory of Medical Genetics, following clinical evaluation, pre-test counselling and signed consent. Clinicians requested wholeexome sequencing (WES, ~19,000 genes). Library prepara- tion kits and Rapid Capture identi ed 10/15 patients, achieving a diagnostic yield of 67%. Causative alterations included known pathogenic variants in thePTPN11 gene (5 variants), 2 in RIT1 gene, 1 in KRAS gene, 1 in SOS1 gene and 1 in SHOC2 gene. Discussion: In most cases, the NS genotype cannot be predicted by phenotype. Even typical cases with character-istic morphological features, pulmonary valve stenosis and short stature, as well as atypical cases, were positive for pathogenic variants in any currently known Noonancausative genes. WES supports marked improvement in diagnostic-yield for NS, including unusual phenotypes and sometimes revealing unusual genotypes. E. Tsoutsou: None. N. Marinakis: None. K. Kosma: Psoni: None. J.

She developed severe congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring amine administration and mechanical ventilation. Given the near-terminal CHF, Trametinib - a selectiveinhibitor of MEK1/2 approved for the treatment of cancers with RAS/MAPK hypersignaling - was introduced (0.022 mg/kg/day). There was prompt improvement in clinicalcondition, allowing inotropes and mechanical ventilation withdrawal; consistent with HCM stabilization, nt-pro-BNP decreased from 30,805 to 2,355 pg/ml. During the nextmonth, treatment was continued without side effects, allowing a progressive reduction of respiratory support. Cardiac ultrasound showed a tendency to HCM improve-ment but revealed the sudden appearance of pulmonary artery dilation. At 3 months of age, she underwent ven- triculoperitoneal shunt device placement for post haemor-rhagic hydrocephalus: after surgery she showed a rapidly worsening of CHF and died at 3\u00bd months of age from untreatable CHF. Autopsy showed an obstructive HCM,severe dilation of pulmonary artery trunk and branches with complete disarray of both gross and ne pulmonary vas- cular anatomy.

Braun-Walicka 1, Bal1 1Department of Medical Genetics, Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland,2Bioimaging Research Center, World Hearing Center at the Institute of Physiology andPathology of Hearing, Kajetany, Poland, 3Department of Child and Family Clinical Psychology of the University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Noonan syndrome (NS) is one of the most common genetic conditions caused by mutations in parti-cular genes of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. Patients with NS might have cognitive problems in language skills,memory, attention, executive functioning and decreased overall intelligence level. The resting-state functional con- nectivity (rsFC) analysis could be particularly useful for characterizing functional brain network differences in populations with intellectual disabilities. Materials and Methods: According to our knowledge this is rst study on functional connectivity in Noonan syndrome. 28 subjects with Noonan syndrome and 23 healthy took part in rs-fMRI data acquisition using a 3 TSiemens PRISMA scanner. All subsequent analysis of rs- fMRI ndings was performed in CONN-fMRI Functional Connectivity (FC) toolbox ver. 18b. We in between- within-network rsFC connec- tivity for key seeds of salience and default mode network. In addition,, subjects underwent a complex assessment ofcognitive abilities with the use of Stanford-Binet Intelli- gence Scales. Results: Overall, both hypo- and hyper- connectivity within salience and DMN networks were revealed in subjects with Noonan syndrome. For example, patients exhibit increased connectivity between DMN networkMPFC seed and superior frontal gyrus bilaterally and PCC and cerebellum. Simultaneously, they demonstrated decreased connectivity within precuneus which is a keyregion of DMN. In respect of IQ, subjects with Noonan syndrome showed decreased Verbal and Nonverbal IQ compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: These ndings imply that the functional architecture of rsFC might be altered in subjects with Noonan syndrome. Supported from NCN research projects no. 2016/21/N/ HS6/02891 N.

Noonan syndrome is the most common entity among this group of disorders and is char- acterized by heart defects, short stature, variable develop-mental delay and typical facial features. Pathogenic variants inSOS2 , encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAS, have recently been identi ed in patients with Noonan syndrome. The number of published cases with pathogenic SOS2 variants is still limited and little is known about genotype-phenotype correlation. Materials and Methods: We collected clinical and genotype data from 17 previously unpublished individuals carrying a disease-causing SOS2 variant. Results: Most individuals had one of the previously reported pathogenic variants; only three had novel changes at the established mutation hotspots, which were classi ed as likely patho- genic. The phenotype of the 17 patients ts well into the spectrum of Noonan syndrome and is most similar to the phenotype observed in patients with SOS1 -related Noonan syndrome, with ectodermal anomalies as common and short stature and learning disabilities as infrequent ndings. The spectrum of heart defects in SOS2 -related Noonan syn- drome was consistent with the known spectrum of cardiac anomalies in RASopathies, but no speci c heart defect was particularly predominating. Notably, lymphatic anomalieswere extraordinarily frequent in our cohort, affecting more than half of the patients. Conclusions: SOS2 -related Noonan syndrome is pheno- typically similar to SOS1 -related Noonan syndrome and associated with a particularly high risk of lymphatic complications that may have a signi cant impact on morbidity and quality of life.

White3,R Hens1, P. 1KULeuven, PA, versity, State College, PA, United States,4Indiana Uni- versity Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN,United States, 5Cardiff University, Cardiff, United King- dom Orofacial clefting is the most common craniofacial mal- formation in humans. Previous research has demonstrated that unaffected relatives of patients with non-syndromiccleft lip with/without cleft palate (NSCL/P) show distinctive facial features, which can be considered an endophenotype. The presence of this facial endophenotype is potentially anexpression of underlying genetic susceptibility to NSCL/P. To investigate this, we applied partial least squares regres- sion (PLSR) to de ne a set of endophenotypic traits in a dataset of 3D facial images from 264 unaffected parents of patients with NSCL/P and 3,171 controls. The PLSR pro- vides a p-value and direction of effect (or trait) for each endophenotype. We observed nominally signi cant (p < 0.05) differences between parents and controls involving 59 endophenotypic traits. Next, we quanti ed these discovered endophenotypic traits in another dataset of 8,246 unaffected European individuals and then subjected these traits to GWAS. We identi ed 29 independent lead SNPs that were associated with at least one of the tested endophenotypic risk phenotypes at the genome-wide level (p < 5e-8). Of the 29 lead SNPs, 22 are in the proximity of SNPs previouslyassociated with normal facial variation and 15 are near genes that show evidence of roles in orofacial clefting. This study supports the existence of an overlap between thegenetic pathways involved in normal facial development and orofacial clefting.

While deletions are associated with macrocephaly, patients withduplications have microcephaly. The SRO in multiple patients (113.5Kb) included three genes and one pseudo- gene, with a suggested major role of PIAS4 in determination of the phenotype and head size in these patients. Here we rene the prox19p13.3del/dup with four additional patients; two with microdeletions, one with microduplication and fortherst time as far as we know one family with single- nucleotide nonsense variant in PIAS4: NM_015897.4: exon9:c.1063C>T:p.Gln355* and concordant phenotype.The variant was detected by NGS and is not present in her healthy parents. PIAS4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by PIAS4 as a small ubiquitin-like modi er (SUMO) ligase that regulates the interaction between E2 enzymes such as UBE2I and the substrateThe patient with the PIAS4 LoF variant displayed a phenotype quite similar to deletionpatients -including the macrocephaly and many other core features of the syndrome. Patient 's SNV was inherited from her mother who is similarly affected. Thus, our data indicatethat PIAS4 is a major contributor to the proximal 19p13.3del/dup syndrome phenotype. In summary, wereport the rst patient with a pathogenic variant in PIAS4 - and three additional rearrangements at the proximal 19p13.3 locus. These observations add further evidence about the molecular basis of this microdeletion/microduplication syndrome. Grants: FIS PI15-01481 P. Lapunzina: None. J. J. None. A.

Stark3,4,T .Y .T a versity, Melbourne, Australia,4The University of Mel- bourne, Melbourne, Australia,5Genetic Health Service New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand Introduction: Verheij syndrome (VRJS) is a neurodeve- by in PUF60 or interstitial deletions of the 8q24.3 region, where PUF60 is located. PUF60 encodes a splicing factor which facilitates assembly of the spliceosome and preferentially activates speci c exons enriched for uridine upstream of their 3 'splice sites. We undertook a literature review of VRJS caused by PUF60 SNVs to ascertain the known mutational and phe- notypic spectrum. This identi ed 25 individuals exhibiting marked phenotypic heterogeneity. Case reports: We report four additional patients, including the rst described patients of Khmer and Indian ethnicities, with previously unreported heterozygous PUF60 variants (3 con rmed de novo, 1 undetermined) identi ed through clinical exome sequencing. These included two novel variants (p.(Pro385Leufs*12) a novel missense change (p.(Arg146Cys)) and one inframe deletion variant (p. (Ala150_Phe152del)). All four patients had global devel- opmental delay (GDD) and underwent thorough phenotypicassessment identifying variable dysmorphism, growth delay, and congenital anomalies. Features unique to our Khmer and Indian patients were talon cusps and proximalinsertion of the right hallux, and craniosynostosis, respectively.Discussion: In combining this detailed phenotypic data with the previously reported, and variably phenotyped, individuals we further re ne the known frequencies of features associated with VRJS. These include GDD (100%), short stature (68%), limb (31%) and other ocular anomalies (61%).

P11.80.B Perinatal mortality in Rasopathies Y. are group of multiple congenital anomalies syndromes clinically and biologically similar including Noonan, Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous and Costello syndromes. Rasopathies occur in a dominant or sporadic manner and arecaused by abnormality of ubiquitous proteins belonging to the cell signalling pathway RAS-MAPKinase. Prenatal symptoms including abnormal nuchal translucency, serosiseffusion or polyhydramnios lead to suspect Rasopathies during pregnancy but little is known about the prognosis of foetuses with prenatal symptoms. By studying the clinicalpresentation and the distribution of molecular anomalies in affected subjects who died in perinatal period, we aimed to nd prognostic elements which could help in counseling. Among more than 1500 positives patients for a mutation in one of the 18 known genes involved in Rasopathies from the French cohort, we selected subjects who died in peri-natale period (during pregnancy or within the 28 days after birth). We collected 65 subjects with severe clinical pre- sentation leading to pregnancy termination (34), stillbirth(15) or death within the 28 days after birth (16). Mutations occurred de novo in 43, was inherited in 14. PTPN11 was involved in 33 cases (50,7%), RAF1 in 12 RIT1 in 10 NRAS ,LZTR1 and NF1 in 1 for each gene. If PTPN11478 J. del Picchiaremains the major gene, RIT1 and RAF1 are more repre- sented in this lethal population compared to the post natal distribution of Rasopathie genes. Whereas SOS1 , which is usually the 2ndgene in Noonan syndrome, is under- represented. Y. Capri: B.

Mutations in several components and regulators of this pathway have been identi ed as pathogenetic cause. In 2015, missense variants in A2ML1 were reported in three unrelated families with clinically suspected Noonan syn- drome (NS). Two subsequent publications reported three additional A2ML1 variants in NS patients. However, an association of A2ML1 variants with NS has not been replicated since. Herein, we report our experience with A2ML1 mutational screening in a large cohort of patients with clinically suspected NS or another RASopathy. Materials and Methods: Individuals included in this study belong to a cohort of 1029 patients with clinicallysuspected NS/RASopathy that underwent RASopathy-related genes including A2ML1 . Results: We report on 15 individuals carrying rare variants in A2ML1 , including previously published variants. The respective A2ML1 variant was inherited in all cases where parental DNA was available. Seven individuals hadan alternate disease-causing genetic aberration. In cases with A2ML1 mutations only, careful re-analysis of the phenotype indicated that clinical features were insuf cient to meet criteria for de nite clinical diagnosis of NS in most. None of the A2ML1 variants evaluated herein reach a classi cation above class 3 (VUS) with strict application of published classi cation criteria. Conclusions: Our ndings underscore that current evidence is insuf cient to support a causal relation of variants in A2ML1 and NS. Inclusion of A2ML1 mutation screening in diagnostic RASopathy testing cannot be recommended. J. Brinkmann: None. C. Lissewski: None. V. Pinna: None. Y. Vial: None. F. Pantaleoni: None. F.

P11.82.A Characterization of a unique karyotype resulting from a complex rearrangement involving the chromosomes 3 and 4 using chromosome analysis, FISH and array- CGH in a girl with facial dysmorphismAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Genomic rearrangements can result in losses, gains, trans- locations and insertions of DNA fragments thereby mod- ifying genome architecture, and potentially having clinicalconsequences. We report on a four-month-old girl with facial dysmorphism. Physical and motoric development was normal. Karyotype analysis presented mosaicism, showingone partially deleted chromosome 4 in all analysed cells and an additional ring chromosome of unknown origin in only part of the cells. Array CGH detected different gains4p15.33p15.31, 4p15.1p12 and 4p12q12 and one deletion in 4q13.3q22.1. Two gains showed mosaicism of 76%. The deletion was detected in a mosaic level of 35%. Therefore,we suggested that the additional ring chromosome consisted of the detected aberrations showing mosaicism. To prove this presumption, we performed FISH. The results con-rmed our hypothesis concerning the ring chromosome and surprisingly identi ed an insertion of material of chromo- some 4 in the short arm of one chromosome 3 in all of theanalysed metaphase spreads. In relation to the array result, this insertion might represent the gain of 4p15.33p15.31, detected without mosaicism. As well as for the gains as forthe deletion, different severe clinical effects were described including developmental delay, behavioural problems, epi- leptic seizures and facial dysmorphisms. The clinical fea-tures could differ due to size of the copy number changes as well as to mosaic level and distribution in different tissues. Our results suggest that the mosaicism of the 4q deletioncould explain the mild clinical features of the little girl. Analysis of the parents showed that the chromosome abnormalities occurred de novo. V. Langhof: None. J. Naab: None. C. Bartaun: None. S. Anders: None. S. Demuth: None. T. Liehr: None. M. Klaus: None. P11.85.A Fetal phenotype of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome caused byCREBBP R\u00e9union, an autosomal dysmorphism, broad thumbs and halluces asso- ciated with intellectual disability. RSTS is caused by in CREBBP (about 60%) and EP300 genes (8%). RSTS is often diagnosed at birth or during early childhood but generally not suspected during antenatal period. We report nine cases of well-documented fetal RSTS. Twocases were examined after death in utero at 18 and 35 weeks of gestation and seven cases after identi cation of ultra- sound abnormalities and termination of pregnancy. Onprenatal sonography, a large gallbladder was detected in two cases, and brain malformations were noted in four cases, especially cerebellar hypoplasia. However, the diag-nosis of RSTS has not been suggested during pregnancy. Fetal autopsy showed that all fetuses had large thumbs and/ or suggestive facial dysmorphism. A CREBBP gene anomaly was identi ed in all cases. Alterations were similar to those found in typical RSTS children. This report will contribute to a better knowledge of the fetal phenotype toconsider the hypothesis of RSTS during pregnancy. Geno- typing allows reassuring genetic counseling. J. Van-Gils: None. S.

Nonsense variants and whole gene deletions cause intellectual disability with marked speech delay, seizures and facial dysmorphisms. Recurrent missense variants atcodons 868-871, forming the critical consensus sequence of the degradation signal, have been associated with classic Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS; MIM269150) which ischaracterized by severe developmental delay, facial dys- morphisms, epilepsy, hydronephrosis, cardiac and brain anomalies and progressive neurodegeneration, malignanciesand frequent early death. Patients with missense mutation near the degradation sequence (codons 862, 867, and 873) exhibit a milder SGS phenotype. novel de heterozygous SETBP1 variants, presenting with mild and atypical phenotypes. Case report: Patient 1 is a 3 years old female with developmental delay, stunted growth, typical SGS facial dysmorphisms, neutropenia, and joint hypermobility, carry- ing a p.Ser854Tyr variant. Patient 2 is a 15 years old male,with speech delay and borderline intellectual disability with autistic traits, carrying the p.Pro995Leu variant, not associated with other sign of SGS. Conclusions: Phenotype severity in patients carrying SETBP1 missense variants depends on localization and biological effect of the variants, providing a likelyexplanation to the mild phenotypes we have observed in these patients. Clinical evaluation and prognosis de nition inSETBP1 patients are challenging. Further functional and genotype-phenotype correlation studies are essential to establish their natural history and management indications. A. Moroni: None. D. Carli: None. E. Giorgio: None. F.

G.B. disomy of chromosome 20 (UPD (20)mat) and advanced maternal age in Silver Russell Syndrome: identi cation of three new cases . Tannorella1, S. Guzzetti1,L Syndrome (SRS, MIM #180860) is a rare (1:30,000-1:100,000) growth retardation disorder, whoseclinical diagnosis is based on the Netchine-Harbison clinical scoring system (NH-CSS), combining six features: pre- and postnatal growth failure, relative macrocephaly, prominentforehead, body asymmetry and feeding dif culties. The molecular mechanisms underlying SRS are highly hetero- geneous, including (epi)genetic deregulation at multipleloci. Over 50% of SRS show loss of methylation (LOM) at the paternal H19/IGF2:IG-DMR (chr11p15.5), about 10% maternal disomy of rare CDKN1C and IGF2 mutations, UPD(16)mat and UPD(20) mat have been reported in a minority of cases. Our studywas aimed to evaluate the frequency of the rarest known molecular defects in a cohort of SRS patients with a NH- CSS3. Within a selected cohort of 176 SRS, 55 patients had LoM at H19/IGF2:IG-DMR (31.3%) and 17 cases showed UPD(7)mat (9.7%). Further investigations on the 104 remaining patients identi ed 3 cases sharing UPD20mat (1,7%), the most frequent out of the rare alterations. The patients, with a clinical score >3, shared prominent forehead, feeding dif culties and postnatal growth delay, while one case had relative macrocephaly, and another body asymmetry. Interestingly maternal age in these three UPD(20)mat cases is >40 years and literaturesurvey pointed out on a total of 16 cases a mean of 38 years, likely due to its origin by trisomy rescue. Our study iden- ties UPD(20)mat as a subclass among patients with NH- CSS3 and elevated maternal age suggesting to introduce this pathomechanism in the SRS diagnostic flow-chart. S. Russo: None. D.

P11.89.B First record of homozygous loss of function variants in theSLF2 gene in patients with chromosome instability syndromesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters . for Medical Human Genetics, Ingelheim, Germany,2King Fahad Military Medical Complex, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia The chromosome instability syndromes are a group of predominantly recessively inherited conditions associated with defects in DNA repair mechanisms that lead to chro- mosomal instability and chromosomal breakage. The so farknown Double Strand Break Repair (DSBR) associated inherited genetic disorders share cancer predisposition, immunode ciency, neurological disease and aplastic ane- mia as main clinical phenotypes. Here we present two patients with the shared clinical symptoms of severe intrauterine growth restriction, short stature, hypotonia,respiratory insuf ciency and dysmorphic features. Chro- mosomal analysis for both patients revealed increased amount of numerical and structural chromosome aberra-tions, indicative for a genetic instability syndrome. Whole exome sequencing analysis revealed novel homozygous loss of [p.(Arg190*) and p. (Asp783Serfs*53)]. SLF2 (SMC5-SMC6 complex locali- zation factor 2) plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by regulating post-replication repair of UV-damaged DNA and genomic stability maintenance. The SLF1-SLF2 complex acts to link RAD18 the SMC5- breaks (DSBs) sites on chromatin during DNA repair. To the best of our knowledge we are presenting here the rst human phenotype of a chromosome instability syndrome in association with SLF2 . Ourndings underline the importance of SLF2 in the DDR pathway and introduce the rst human chromosomal and phenotypic presentation associated with a defect in this gene. In addition to diagnostic analysis, reporting scienti c ndings in disease candidate genes seems to be a crucial task of the diagnostic laboratory settings. N. Nahavandi: None. Z. Y\u00fcksel: None.

This feature allows to speci cally distinguish SNF from Neuro bromatosis (MNFSR), presenting isolated bromas. clinical phenotype of SNF, MNSFR and classical NF1 can be revealed by spinal MRI, little is known on the molecular basis underlying these conditions. Weinvestigated 12 NF1 families with at least one SNF patient, 15 sporadic SNF/MNSFR patients, diagnosed by Spinal MRI. We applied Targeted NGS using a panel consisting of139 genes encoding RAS pathway effectors, neuro bromin interactors and genes mapping ed 26 NF1 variants, 36,6% were missense mutations, indicating an increased prevalence in our cohort versus 27,7% missense/nonsense mutations reported in Italian (PMID: 26740943) and in a British (PMID:28637487) NF1population. Furthermore, we evaluated rare variants with damaging predictors in genes of RAS pathway and neuro- bromin interactors. In more than one sporadic case MAP3K1, SNF family were detected RASAL1, RASAL3,MAP3K1 genes variations. Our results con rm the high frequency of missense mutations in SNF as to SNF. In some patients, the co-occurrence of potential pathogenic variants in NF1 related genes are detected with severephenotypes, suggesting that they might be modi er genes and promising pharmacological targets.

Shinawi1 University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, United States,2Department of Molecular Medicine, Al Jawhara Center for Molecular Medicine, Genetics andInherited Diseases, College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Manama, Bahrain, 3Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, Bahrain Defense Force Hospital,Manama, Bahrain, 4Department of Pediatrics, Queen 's University, Kingston, ON, Canada Introduction: (cerebral dysgenesis, neuropathy, ichthyosis, and keratoderma) syndrome (MIM# 609528) is a condition (15 published cases) caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in SNAP29 , which encodes membrane traf processes. Clinical man- ifestations include developmental delay (DD)/ brain malformations including cortical migration and corpus callosum (CC) defects, failure to thrive, and skin abnormalities. Materials and Methods: Clinical trio exome or targeted sequencing was performed for each case to elucidate the cause of DD/ID and of other speci cndings. Results: We report with homozygous predicted loss-of-function variants in SNAP29 , four 4/5 had ophthalmological ndings. Other phenotypes were variable between cases, including facial features, poor growth and feeding dif culties, and recurrent respiratory infections. The cohort includes 2 siblings with a c.2T>Cvariant who have a milder neurological phenotype, a patient with the most C-terminal variant yet described (c.622G>T) with a more severe phenotype, and two patients withpreviously described variants (c.354dupG, c.487dupA). Conclusions: We describe ve additional patients with CEDNIK syndrome, including novel SNAP29 variants and the oldest known surviving individual. Our cohort expands the genotypic and phenotypic (seizures and strabismus) spectrum of CEDNIK syndrome. Table 1.

WeAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) with different LOF mutations show no obvious phenotype. Interestingly, in contrast to the proteins implicated in ciliary kidney disorders, TMEM260 long isoform showed a moderate cytoplasmic and a strong nuclear membranelocalization. The short isoform located in the cytoplasm and strongly in the nucleus. Neither isoforms were detectable in the primary cilium. Mutations of TMEM260 arteriosus. Conclusions: Our results are strongly supported by one publication indicating the role of TMEM260 in this syndrome. The preserved translation of the short isoform in all three affected families strongly suggest that thedysfunction of the short isoform is intrauterine lethal. T.M. Keszthelyi: None. M. Varga: None.

Giglio Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Biomedical Sciences 'Mario Serio ', Univer- sity of Florence, I-50139 Florence, Italy., Florence, Italy We report the case of a boy evaluated mainly for trigono- cephaly and generalized seizures. His critical events were poorly controlled by antiepileptic multi-drug therapy. His phenotype with some facial features (thick eyebrows, epi-canthus, long ltering, thin upper lip), growth and psy- chomotor development delay, renal ectopia, complete hip dislocation, thin corpus callosum with scarcity of whitematter, did not suggest any speci c condition. Karyotype and CGH-array analysis were normal. Whole sequencing (WES) revealed a heterozygous frameshiftvariant in KMT2A in a premature stop codon. Variants in KMT2A have been already described in patients with Wiedeman-Steiner Syndrome (WSS). This geneencodes a histone methyltransferase involved in the reg- ulation of chromatin-mediated transcription and it is widely expressed in most human tissues. The majority of WSS-associated variants reported so far are de novo loss-of- function, predicted to result in premature termination of translation and nonsense-mediated decay of the corre-sponding transcripts. WSS is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by short stature, developmentaldelay and intellectual disability, hypertrichosis (cubiti-hairy elbow-or generalized) and facial dysmorphism. Concerning the incidence of bone anomalies, to date trigonocephaly (a feature at our rst evaluation) has been reported only in one case, while craniovertebral junction anomalies have been described in two other patients; both of these signs were notincluded in the features associated with WSS. Further data will be needed to evaluate the exact incidence of these features in subjects with WSS associated with hap-loinsuf ciency of a gene involved in histone-mediated chromatin remodeling. E.

Copy number variants (CNV) involving the X chromosome hasbeen previously described, mainly deletions (e.g. Leri-Weill dyschondrostsosis). However, little is known about pheno- types arising from duplications. In this study, we reviewedCNVs involving the short arm of the X chromosome, spe- cically duplications involving band P22. This region contains 194 genes, only 107 have an OMIM description(e.g. SHOX andSTS). Materials and Methods: Cases that underwent array comparative genomic hybridization between years (2016-2019) were reviewed. Indication for testing was variable, ranging from developmental delay, seizures to multiple congenital anomalies. We focused on cases with duplicationinvolving Xp22 Results: 69 cases reported with CNVs involving (33/69) with Thesize of the duplication ranged from 147 Kb to 2.3 Mb. The detected CNVs ranged from benign or likely benign (12/484 J. del Picchia33), pathogenic or likely pathogenic (9/33) and variants of unknown signi cance (12/33). Some cases were de novo, others were inherited from a healthy parent. Variable expressivity and low penetrance were observed in this cohort. Conclusions: Deletions affecting the X chromosome is usually associated with a known clinical syndrome that could be male lethal. However, duplications tend to be milder, showing variable expressivity and penetrance,which makes it hard to con rm pathogenicity. N. Alsaleh: None. I. Ben Abdallah: None. A. Al Hashem: None. H.

Materials and Methods: We in affected patients in zebra sh. Results: We present genetic and detailed phenotypic information on 23 newly identi ed families and simplex cases that include 19 affected females from 18 families and 14 affected males from nine families. The genetic spectrumAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 485ofZC4H2 defects comprises novel and recurrent mostly inherited missense variants in affected males, and de novo splicing, frameshift, nonsense, and partial ZC4H2 deletions in affected females. Two newly identi ed missense variants were investigated by studies in zebra sh and the results supported pathogenicity. Of note, the 15 females withdeleterious de novo ZC4H2 variants presented with phenotypes ranging from mild to severe, and their clinical features overlapped with those seen in affected males. Bycontrast, of the nine carrier females with inherited ZC4H2 missense variants that were deleterious in affected male relatives, four were symptomatic. We also comparedclinical phenotypes with previously published cases of both sexes and provide an overview on 48 males and 57 females from 42 families. Conclusions: We propose ZC4H2 as a good candidate for early genetic testing of males and females with a clinical suspicion of fetal hypo-/akinesia and/or (neurogenic) AMC.Grants: DDD F. None. None.

Our recent integrative analysis of GWAS and GTEx eQTL data showed that the risk allele of the SNP (rs147462972) at the genome-wide signi cant locus 5p15 is associated with increased SLC9A3 expression in esophageal mucosa tissue. Interestingly, upregulation of this gene has been linked to gastro-esophageal re flux disorder, a major risk factor for BE development. Therefore, we hypothesize that rs147462972 maps to a regulatory element in fluencing SLC9A3 expression. To study the regulatory mechanisms at 5p15, chromatin interactions are analyzed using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) technology from two distinct viewpoints, the promoter of SLC9A3 and the region around rs147462972. The method was rst estab- lished in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), where numerous interactions at the locus and beyond wereobserved. Further analyses will be performed in different cell lines representative of the course of BE/EA develop- ment: (OE19). between the SLC9A3 promoter and the sentinel SNP was detected at 5p15 in iPSC. A lack of thisinteraction was assumed, since these cells do not express SLC9A3 . Based on these results, the experiments in esophageal cell lines are currently ongoing and the resultswill be presented at the conference. Our work will help to understand the contribution of the risk locus 5p15 to the etiology of BE and EA, and the role of SLC9A3 in their pathogenesis. J. Schr\u00f6der: None. R. Hollstein: None. I.

High-throughput sequencing characteristic mutation spectra in two leu- kemia subtypes; however, the role of different mutationevents in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Patients and methods: In total, 9 patients with t(8;21) and 16 patients with inv(16) were investigated (13 boys and12 girls, mean age 7.2 years). For 18 patients, paired samples at diagnosis and remission were analyzed. Coding regions of 84 genes, involved in the pathogenesis of AML,were captured with SeqCap EZ Target Enrichment System (NimbleGen, Roche) and sequenced Illumina platform. Results: for inv (16) compared to t(8;21) (56% vs. 11%, p =0.04). In the group with inv(16), KIT mutations in exon 8 (66%) prevailed comparing with exon 17 (33%); two patients(12.5%) had biallelic KITmutations. In CBL,CBLB , ,EZH2 genes patients with inv(16), mutations in the KDM6A and KMT2A genes, involved in chromatin modi cation, were found. Conclusions: Mutational pro ling revealed characteristic differences in spectrum and frequency of somatic mutations in patients with t(8;21) and inv(16).

Yen2 1Center of Medical Genetics, Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan,2Department of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan, 3Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Tai- wan Introduction: Although cytarabine (ara-C) has remained an important cornerstone for treatment of acute myeloid leu- kemia (AML) for decades, chemo-resistance is commonand the overall survival of adult AML patients is less than 40%. Internal tandem duplication mutations in the FLT3Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 487tyrosine kinase receptor (FLT3-ITD) account for up to 30% of cases and are associated with a poor outcome. To understand the role of FLT3-ITD in the development of drug resistance. An ara-C resistant cell line (MV-4-11-CR) was established from parent MV-4-11 cells which harbors FLT3-ITD. Here, we compared MV-4-11-CR with MV-4-11 cells, and explored the underling mechanisms for developing resistance in FLT3-ITD AML cells. Materials and Methods: MV-4-11-CR and MV-4-11 cells performed tests including RTqPCR, Western blot, G-banding and SKY. Results: MV-4-11-CR cells were highly resistant to ara-C by their high IC50 value, and enhanced cell growth rate. This cell line was con rmed to retain the homologous FLT3-ITD mutations. However, a signi cant increase of FLT3-ITD mRNA and protein was observed. To test whether FLT3-ITD activation is crucial for resistance, we measured the effects of combined treatment of cells withara-C and FLT3 inhibitors. Inhibition of FLT3 was notably effective in cell viability, but not effective in drug sensitivity. We further compared genomic alterations andfound multiple chromosomal changes and complex We suggest that gain the resistance to ara-C may be associated with chromosomal aberrations and DCKdeciency in FLT3-ITD +AML cells.

Crysandt2, of Medicine (Hematology Transplantation), University Hospital RWTH Aachen,Aachen, Germany Introduction: The current diagnostic scheme for classi - cation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is usually based on cytogenetic and molecular biology methods. The turnaround time for karyotype analysis is up to two weeks,due to the indispensable cultivation of hematopoietic cells. Although initial PCR or FISH-based testing for recurrent structural variations (SV) can be carried out within fewhours, the AML classi cation is demanding and requires accurate karyotyping.Methods: We utilized nanopore-sequencing to overcome the time-consuming karyotyping and further increase resolution and accelerate SV analysis for AML classi ca- tion. In detail, low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LC-WGS) was carried out in combination with a modi ed SMURFseq protocol on AML bone marrow or bloodsamples ( 20% LC-WGS in Genome-wide CNV analysis was done from SMURFSeq data. Results: For all 16 samples the results from nanopore- sequencing con rmed the SV identi ed by FISH analyses. Translocations, inversions,tandem duplications and CNVs were identi ed at single base resolution. We could detect additional small CNVs in growth regulating genes which may modify the aggressive-ness of the leukemia. Moreover, the procedure from DNA isolation to obtaining results requires less than 48h and is not operator dependent. The method can also generatekaryotype data from samples for which the cell cultivation failed. Conclusions: We show that nanopore-sequencing can speed-up and potentially improve the comprehensive analysis of SV in AML. Rapid classi cation according to ELN risk strati cation will immediately impact on targeted and risk adapted treatment of AML patients. F. Kraft: None. P. Kr\u00fcger: None. S. Koschmieder: None. E.

With the aim of improving and standardizing variant classi ca- tion, we 'll create a national registry of genetic variants in cancer predisposing-genes. To that end, seven Spanishmolecular laboratory groups currently using NGS panels for hereditary cancer diagnostics created a variant database. Our current database gathers all variants with less than 1%allele frequency in all GnomAD outbred populations, starting with the ATM gene, study because of its moderate increase in breast cancer risk and its remarkable number ofVUSes. The methodology consisted of: 1) selection and curation of 50 representative variants from our cohort; 2) evaluation of each by three members; and 3) discussion ofevidences for classi cation in monthly teleconferences. As ATM -speci c guidelines have not been published, we have previously carried out our own ACMG/AMP criterionadjustment. So far, 842 variants belonging to 730 tested patients with different hereditary cancer conditions. Among the 265 unique variants, 97 appeared more than once, and35 had differences in classi cation among groups. Our newATM -speci c criteria have allowed us to improve and standardize the classi cation of the 50 pilot variants. We 'll next submit our classi cations to international databases and extend our database to other Spanish participants and hereditary cancer genes.

Hahn 1, Diego, CA, United States,3Eppendorf Application Tech- nologies SA, Namur, Belgium Due to the growing number of relevant genes and variants, next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a standardtechnique in the eld of cancer research and molecular pathology. AmpliSeq TMpanels for Illumina \u00aehave been introduced to study the growing number of interesting var-iants in an increasing number of relevant genes. In theory, library preparation with such panels promise the ability query many interesting loci in DNA or RNA isolated from a broadrange of specimen, including blood, cell culture, and formalin- xed paraf n-embedded (FFPE) tissue at low efforts. However, especially working with the latter materialscan represent practical challenges that require robust and established work flows for analytical studies. Here we sought to establish a work flow for this purpose using automated liquid handling for library preparation on the ep Motion sys- tem that can accommodate both RNA and DNA samples. We show exemplary NGS sequencing data achieved with theAmpliSeq for Illumina Focus panel assembled from indivi- dual DNA and RNA reference sample sets with known mutations and quality generated in a single automated setup.We found high run-to-run reproducibility and repeatability (R\u00b2>0.98) with 100% success rate for library preparation (DNA n=;R N A n=preparations). Call rates of known variants (R\u00b2>0.99) and fusion transcripts were consistent over several independent experimental replicates. FurthermoreAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 489variant calling and index representation were comparable to manual preparations performed on the same samples.

Kilic Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands The BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS) is a hereditary tumor syndrome caused by germline patho- genic variants in BAP1. It is risks for uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma,renal cell carcinoma, and cutaneous BAP1-inactivated nevi. A 50 year old female patient presented with pneumothorax, caused by bilateral mesothelioma, with no history ofasbestos exposure. Molecular analysis of the tumor showed a pathogenic variant and a variant of unknown signi cance (the c.535C>T, p.(Arg179Trp) variant) in the right tumor.The left tumor showed the same variant of unknown sig- nicance (VUS) as found in the other tumor, but no second mutation. Both tumors showed no staining for BAP1 byimmunohistochemistry. DNA analysis of a blood sample conrmed that the VUS is present in the germline. RNA analysis showed expression of both the wild type and thevariant allele in the same amount. Clinical work up of the patient showed no signs of uveal melanoma. Testing of healthy parents showed the VUS is present in the 80 yearold mother of the proband. In the meantime the mother also developed mesothelioma, with no history of asbestos exposure. Molecular analysis of the tumor of the mothershowed the VUS that is present in germline and another somatic VUS in the other BAP1 allele. The tumor was positive for staining of the BAP1 protein. Family history ispositive for basal cell carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma of thekidney and lung cancer. At the moment further testing of affected family members is conducted. B.W. van Paassen: None.

By the literature, 5-30% of patients with bilateral breast cancer carry a pathogenic variant in thehigh-penetrant BRCA genes. Our aim was to determine the spectrum of pathogenic variants in HBOC genes among Slovene bilateral breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Among 2483 HBOC patients tested between years 2014 and 2019, 205 patients with bilateral breast cancer were included in the study. gDNAwas extracted from peripheral blood and NGS sequencing was performed using Nextera_DNA_Library_Preparation_- Kit in combination with Illumina 's TruSight_Cancer_Panel or TruSight_Hereditary_Panel. All variants were classi ed according to ACMG_guidelines. Results: Among 205 patients with bilateral breast cancer, 124 (60.5%) had positive HBOC family history and 81 (39.5%) had no HBOC family history. A pathogenic variant in one of HBOC genes listed in the NCCN guidelines wasdetected in 58 patients, which represents 28.3% of all patients. Most of them (67.2 %) were patients with positive HBOC family history. Majority of patients with pathogenicvariant harbored variant in BRCA genes: 50.0% in BRCA2 . of bilateral breast cancer patients with positive family history had pathogenic variant in HBOC genes: 68.9% of cases in BRCA genes and 61.5% cases in other genes. The frequency of BRCA pathogenicvariants in Slovene patients with bilateral breast cancer is similar to frequencies reported in the literature. G. Klancar: None. P. Skrel: None. V.

They originate from germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) caused by genetic and epigenetic incidents. With currently used TGCT biomarkers lacking speci city and sensitivity, stronger discriminatory biomarkers for various forms of TGCTs are needed. Our goal was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of POU5F1, NANOG,KIT, SALL4, HOXA9 and MGMT assessed at the protein level (current clinical use) alongside mRNA expression, DNA alteration and DNA methylation using prominentdatabases. Materials and Methods: For TGCT patient data were retrieved TCGA while healthy adult testis data from using platforms. Results: Our results suggest that TGCT could be discriminated from healthy tissue by difference in mRNAlevels (all investigated genes), while SE from NSE by increased mRNA level ( KIT) and DNA hypomethylation (MGMT and Identi cation of individual NSE types and GCNIS was possible only by analysing gene expression at the protein level ( HOXA9 ,KIT,SALL4 and POU5F1 ), since databases present NSE as a single entity and no data on GCNIS. Conclusions: There is discriminatory value in gene expression at the mRNA level and DNA methylation ofanalysed genes in TGCT diagnostics. Promoting the inclusion of further molecular analyses, rather than just at the protein level, enhances the development of TGCT diagnostics as has recently been done for other types of tumours. J.

P12.014.A BIRC5 gene polymorphisms and gene expression of eight different isoforms in breast cancer V. Musani 1, M. Vinceti 1,I .S u ac2, Trnski1, 1Rudjer Bo Zagreb, Polyclinic, Introduction: Survivin (encoded by BIRC5 - baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5) gene is the smallest member od thefamily of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins. Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers and is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in women inthe world. Materials and Methods: The whole coding region, including alternate exons S-2 , S-2B and S-3B, as well 'UTR regions of BIRC5 gene was genotyped in eighteen BC 3V) were analyzed at the mRNA expression level in BC samples and matching healthy tissues. TBP gene was used as housekeeping control. Results: Eleven different polymorphisms were found in the breast cancer samples. All eight isoforms were detected in BC samples, but isoforms S-3 M and S-3 V were not expressed in any of the healthy matching tissues. S-WT and S-2isoforms had the highest expression, followed by S- S-3B, S-2B, S-3 , and S-3 M and the lowest. All isoforms, except for S-2B, S-3 M and S-3 V, had signi cantly higher expression in cancer tissue in comparison to healthy tissue. Expression of three isoforms,S-3, S-3M and S-3 V showed signi c.-644T>C, c.9386T>C, and c.10611C>A. Conclusions: At least eight different BIRC5 isoforms are expressed in breast cancer. The isoforms showed signi cant positive association in BC tissues, and less so in healthytissue. The isoforms showed signi cant association with different polymorphisms.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 491V. Rare congenital disease: Bloom syndrome. Complex genetic analysis R. Michalovsk\u00e11, V. Kruli ov\u00e11,T .P \u00ed 1, L. Czech Republic,2LLG, Pardubice, Czech Republic Introduction: syndrome (BS) is a very rare auto- somal recessive disease characterized by prenatal andpostnatal growth retardation, photosensitive skin changes, immune de ciency, insulin resistance, and signi cantly increased risk of cancer in very young age. BS is caused bypathogenic variants in the BLM gene. Absence of functional BLM protein causes chromosome instability, excessive homologous recombination, and increased numbers of sisterchromatids exchanges. Materials and Methods: We performed massive parallel sequencing on NextSeq (Illumina) using Sequence Capture(ROCHE) panel of 55 genes. Examination of spontaneous chromosome aberrations (ZCA) and classical conventional cytogenetic analysis (G band) were used as standardcytogenetic procedures. Results: The 12 year old boy born from second physiological pregnancy (sp2760 g, PD 46 cm) wasgenetically examined for a number of non-speci c clinical problems and due to the occurrence of cancer in the family, respectively. We detected variants in BLM gene in the compound heterozygous state paternally, class 4),which con rmed clinical diagnosis of Bloom syndrome. Subsequent cytogenetic analysis of SCE and ZCA supports the outcome of molecular genetic testing and presentscomplex examination in the rare chromosome instability syndrome of the genome Conclusions: Given the anamnestic data, a very rare disease called Bloom syndrome was predicted as a possible genetic background of the patient 's phenotype.

The successful targeted therapies against this mutation explainthe importance of the analysis of concomitant molecular transformations in this pathology. Materials and methods: In order to evaluate the differential gene expression pro le between BRAF-positive and BRAF- negative samples in PTC patients we used DNA Agilent microarray. There were included 24 patients (8 classical PTC,14 follicular variant of PTC, 2 insular and/or sclerosing variant of PTC), with 2 samples per patient (tumor and normal samples) obtained shortly afte r surgery. Patients gave their informed consent for study before surgery. Microarray analysis was performed following Agilent One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Expression arrays by Sanger sequencing. Results: The list of differential expressed genes (DEGs) between BRAF( +) and BRAF(-) samples was obtained by statistical analysis using GeneSpring GX-PA 14.5 software. Moderated T-Test with p < 0.05 identi ed 541 DEGs. Applying a fold-change >2 the list restricted to 536 p-value with Benjamini-Hochberg correc- tion) gave a nal list of 125 DEGs, 91 genes upregulated and 34 down-regulated between cPTC and the other types of tumors. The Kegg pathway analysis suggested \"pathways in cancer \"as the most signi cant signal pathway, followed by N- glycan biosynthesis and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Conclusions: Differential gene expression analysis could be a valuable source of information regarding the molecular changes and pathways involved in BRAF-related papillary thyroid carcinomas (CNCS-UEFISCDI None.

E. of Pathology and Laboratory Diagnostics, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of492 J. del PicchiaOncology, Warsaw, Poland,2Genetic Outpatient Clinic, Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Warsaw, Poland Introduction: Pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 can be identi ed in more than 10% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. With the introduction of targeted therapy for BRCA-de cient recurrrent ovarian cancer and breast can- cer, testing for somatic/germline mutations in BRCA1/2 genes in tumor tissue became essenti al for treatment decisions. Identi cation of pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants, especially large rearrangements in DNA isolated form FFPE, is challenging due to the high fragmentation grad e of formalin-treated DNA and chemical modi cations that lower the DNA quality. Therefore, the aim of the study was to verify the usefulness of NGSanalysis of BRCA1/2 large rear rangements detection in DNA isolated from blood and FFPE samples. Materials and Methods: 920 blood samples from patients with ovarian/breast cancer and 233 FFPE tissue samples from ovarian cancer patients were enrolled. FFPE tumor cell content was determined by a pathologist andtumor tissue was micro-dissected prior to DNA isolation. The NGS technology was used to detect BRCA1/2 large rearrangements in all the samples. All detected BRCA1/2-deletions were con rmed by MLPA method. Results: In total we detected 18 large deletions: 12 in 920 blood-derived DNA and 6 in 233 FFPE isolated DNA. In 15cases deletions were detected in BRCA1 gene and 3 in BRCA2 . Conclusions: The detection rate of large rearrangements was similar in both FFPE samples a nd blood derived DNA reaching 1% and 3%, respectively. The results show that BRCA1/2 large rearrangements can be relia bly detected in both FFPE and blood derived DNA by next-generation sequencing (NGS). A. Podgorska: None. A. Stachurska: None. E.

Bublitz , J. L. van Luttikhuizen, S. Schubert, W. Hofmann, G. Schmidt, B. Schlegelberger, D. Steinemann Department of Human Genetics, Hannover, Germany Introduction: The genetic predisposition causing heredi- tary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) remains in the majority of patients unknown. We hypothesize that a subsetof HBOC is caused by regulatory variants located outside ofcoding regions of the highly penetrant genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1 /2). Materials and Methods: We selected 96 high-risk HBOC patients tested negative for (likely) pathogenic variants in 94 cancer-associated genes using the TruSight Cancer panel and high resolution CGH-arrays. Theirgenomic BRCA1/2 loci including introns and flanking intergenic regions, comprising 140 kb each, were rst enriched using a SureSelect custom panel and subsequentlysequenced on Illumina NextSeq and 100 variants per gene had a MAF 0.1% in the general population (gnomAD) and <5% in our cohort. Using in silico analyses, such as CADD, ncER, and Alamut, remaining further prioritized. Amongothers, one BRCA1 variant (c.5333-469T>A, intron 21 of 23) is predicted to create a novel acceptor splice site, which appears stronger than the canonical site. The variant mightlead to intron retention, which is currently tested on transcription level to prove the predicted splicing effect. Conclusions: As the eld of genomic sequencing and variant interpretation rapidly progresses, regulatory variants should be included in the search for cancer predisposing variants. The identi cation and characterization of genetic predispositions outside the coding genome cannot only provide HBOC patients with superior treatment and prevention plans, but may also offer new insights intotranscriptional regulation of BRCA1/2 .

P12.020.A Is HRT safe for BRCA mutation carriers after risk reduction salpingo-oophorectomy? A 7.5 year cohort study S. Gabizon-Peretz 1, S. Paluch-Shimon1,2, S. Armon1,3,E . Zedek Medical Obstetrics & Gynecology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel,4Medical Genetics Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusa-lem, Israel replacement treatment (HRT) after Risk-Reducing-Salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is controversial. In the general population, HRT slightly raises breast cancer (BC) risk(HR=1.34). However, it is unclear whether this applies to mutation carriers. Our hypothesis was that short-term use ofAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 493HRT from RRSO till age 50 would not elevate BC risk signicantly more than baseline risk of healthy carriers. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 306 healthy BRCA1/ 2 mutation carriers who had undergone RRSO was followed-up for a mean duration of 7.26 years. We compared BC incidence over time in carriers who receivedHRT vs. those who didn 't. Results: During follow-up, BC incidence was 22/150 HRT vs. 16/156 women (10.2%) in non-HRT group (OR =1.371, NS), when controlled for age, the association appeared stronger (OR =1.996, NS). However, survival analysis didn 't demonstrate a signi cant difference in BC incidence (HR =1.777, NS), possibly due to shorter follow- up in HRT group (6.2 vs. 8.3 years, p < 0.001). Median age at BC diagnosis appeared earlier (43.5 vs. 49 years, respectively),and latency period to BC diagnosis seemed shorter in HRT group vs. non-HRT group (invasive BC 1.58 vs. 3.45 years, respectively, DCIS 1.92 vs. 6.52 years, respectively), however,neither of these differences was signi cant. Conclusions: In our BRCA carrier cohort, followed for ~7.5 years post-RRSO, there is no evidence that HRTelevates breast cancer incidence, or signi cantly shortens the latency period between RRSO and cancer diagnosis. However, caution in HRT administration is warranted untillarger, prospective studies show similar results. S. Gabizon-Peretz: None. S. Paluch-Shimon: None. S. Armon: None. E. Levy-Lahad: BRCA2 Pathogenic Exon 5-11 Duplication in the Christian Arab Population in Northern Israel N. Ekhilevitch rambam, HAIFA, IsraelMost of the genetic research of BRCA1/2 genes germline mutations in Israel have been focused on the Jewish IsraeliPopulation. The Christian Arab population in Israel accounts for about 2% of the population. Unlike in the Jewish population founder BRCA1/2 mutations have not yet been reported in the Christian Arab population. Here we describe a recurrent BRCA2 pathogenic rearran- gement in four patients from different families with apersonal and/ or familial history of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC). During the years 2015-2019, 20 Christian Arab patients with a personal or familial history ofbreast (BC) and/ or ovarian (OC) cancer were to BRCA1/2 testing (Sequencing and Copy Number Variants (CNV 's) analysis). A recurrent gross duplication of the genomic region encompassing exons 5-10 and the 5 'portion of exon 11 of the BRCA2 gene was found in 4 out of 20(20%) patients from different Christian Arab families. This duplicated is expected to result in an absent or disrupted protein product. A similar duplication has been reported in the literature in two individuals affected with BC. The Exon 5-11 BRCA2 Duplication is a recurrent rearrangement, possibly founder in the Christian Arab population inNorthern Israel. It is important to include CNV 's analysis in all Christian Arab patients suspected for HBOC. Farther research is needed to evaluate the carrier frequency of this rearrangement in the Christian Arab population and the degree of its penetrance. These results should help guide the BRCA1/2 genes testing strategy inthis population. N. Ekhilevitch: None.

Pathogenic germline variants inBRCA1 andBRCA2 account for 25% of identi cation of genetic defects in HBOC patients allows detection of carriers that can bene t from cancer risk management protocols, and predictive genetic testing to at- risk family members, after appropriate genetic counseling. Two female patients with a personal and family history ofcancer were studied by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Methods: NGS using TruSight Cancer Panel (Illumina) followed by bioinformatic analysis of 18 genes associatedwith HBOC was performed. Pathogenic variants were conrmed by Sanger sequencing.494 J. del PicchiaResults: A rare event of double heterozigosity for pathogenic variants was identi ed in both patients: patient A c.2037delinsCC, p. (Lys679Asn*4) three rela- tives of patient A were analyzed: while one of her two healthy sons was heterozygous for the ATM variant, the other was a double heterozygote for BRCA1: c.2037delinsCC and ATM: c.3802delG; a female cousin, recently diagnosed with breast cancer, was a carrier ofATM: c.3802delG only. Conclusions: The identi cation of these two rare cases of double heterozigosity for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/ BRCA2 andATM genes, highlights the importance of using NGS-gene panel testing in HBOC. If molecular analysis had been restricted to BRCA genes only, the pathogenic ATM variants would have been missed in both families, depriving them of appropriate genetic counseling and cancer risk management.

Prior prevalence estimates of BRCA1 and BRCA 2p r o t e i n - truncating variants (PTVs) have been generally limited to studies that have ascertained for cancer patients or individuals with a family history of cancer. The aim of this study is toutilise one of the largest sequenced Biobank populations to investigate the prevalence of participants ( https://www.ukbiobank. ac.uk/ ), which is a prospective cohort study linked to deep phenotypic data. Among the 300,000 exomes, we identi ed 1332 carriers of high con dence rare PTVs in BRCA1/2 and another set of 62 carriers of ClinVar pathogenic/likelypathogenic classi ed pathogenic variant carriers, 529 (38.0%) have been diagnosed with cancer, 455 (32.6%) havea reported family history of cancer but are not diagnosed with cancer and 410 (29.4%) have no reported history (or family history) of cancer. For the 529 individuals with a cancer diagnosis we further evaluated the contribution that they have to 100 distinct ICD10 primary cancer phenotypes and iden- tied that ovarian (5.3% of reported), breast (2% of reported), prostate (1% of reported), pancreas (1.5% of reported) and lung (1.1% of reported) cancers are amongst the cancers that are signi cantly enriched for these BRCA1/2 putatively pathogenic variants. This study provides an unbiased sum- mary of germline BRCA1/2 contribution to various primary cancers and highlights the value of careful variantinterpretation. Z. Ghazoui: A.

Atanasoska 1,2, MD\",S o a, Bulgaria,2Soa University St. Kliment Ohridski, Faculty of Biology, Department of Genetics,Soa, Bulgaria, 3Soa University St. Kliment Ohridski, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biology, Medical genetics and Microbiology, So a, Bulgaria,4Department of Medical Genetics, Medical University of So a, So a, Bulgaria Introduction: There are more than 840 ovarian cancer cases in Bulgaria and more than 240 000 worldwide, every year. OC represents 3.7% of all female cancers and it is themain cause for cancer deaths with gynecologic malignancy. Fifteen to thirty ve percent of the familial cases are carriers of pathogenic variants in tumor suppressor genes. There aremore than 16 known genes associated with hereditary ovarian carcinogenesis. Here we present a retrospective review of rare genetic variants in different tumor suppressorgenes in BRCA 1/2 negative Bulgarian patients with diag- nosed ovarian cancer. Materials and Methods: Our cohort includes 91 patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Their DNA samples were investigated for the presence of pathogenic variants in 94 cancer-predisposing genes. Sequence analysis was per-formed on an Illumina platform. We identi ed germline pathogenic variants in (21/91) of the patients. The pathogenic variants in theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 495BRCA 1/2 genes were detected in (16/91) of the patients. In 6.6% (5/75) of BRCA1/2 negative patients pathogenic ATM, CHEK2, FANCA, FANCL andBLM genes. Conclusions: The risk of ovarian cancer increases parallel with the modernization and the social economicdevelopment. The precise and fast identi cation of pathogenic variants in the ovarian cancer-predisposing genes is a key in the decision-making process for therapystrategies. Our results gain a better understanding of the genetic complexity of the disease and may result in a more personalized approach for cancer risk management in apreventive settings, early diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of ovarian cancer.

P12.026.A Relevance of for the classi cation of BRCA1 intronic variants and clinical management M. Ferreira1,2, S. Castedo1,2,5 1Institute of Molecular Pathology of the University of Porto (Ipatimup), Porto, Portugal,2Institute for Research and Innovation in Health Porto, de Coimbra, Coimbra, Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal,5Faculty of Medicine, University of Carriers of BRCA1 orBRCA2 pathogenic variants have a high lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. The most common pathogenic variants in BRCA1 gene are nonsense and frameshift variants, however there are well documented pathogenic site variants. Classi cation of intronic variants can be challenging and frequently demands further molecular studies. We iden-tied a breast cancer (BC) family with six family members affected with BC. In the proband c.4675 +3A>C BRCA1 variant was identi ed, which was later found to be present in two more affected relatives (of the remaining patients, two were deceased and one awaits genetic counselling). Due to lack of further evidence, this variant was classi ed as variant of unknown signi cance, according to the ACMG guidelines. To clarify the clinical signi cance of this variant, we decided to evaluate its splicing impact. Material and Methods: We performed RT-PCR in cDNA synthetized from a RNA sample of the proband,followed by Sanger sequencing, to evaluate the splicing impact of the c.4675 +3A>C BRCA1 . Results: We were able to identify an aberrant transcript, as a result of the creation of a new splice site, located 5`- upstream from the canonical site that is translated into a truncated protein, p.Gln1556Glyfs*14. Conclusions: Based on these ndings and the absence of this variant in the population, we were able to reclassify the c.4675+3A>C BRCA1 variant as pathogenic, thereby warranting the genetic study of at risk relatives, and making carriers eligible for surveillance and, when clinically applicable, treatment with PARPi.

Loginov, Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan (Volga Region) Federal University, Kazan, Russian Fed-eration, 3Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, RIKEN, Wako, Japan Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Genetic testing is used to identify hereditary breast cancer. Hereditary breast cancer is a polygenic disease, andnext-generation sequencing allows the most comprehensive genetic examination of patients. Materials and Methods: We performed the analysis of the genomic DNA of 62 patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer, who were treated in Moscow Clinical Scienti c Center n.a. Loginov. The average age at diagnosis were43 \u00b1 6.5 years. Three patients were diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer, and another 4 had a combination of breast cancer and other malignancy. A family history of 31patients was burdened with malignant tumors. All patients had negative test results for 8 frequent mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. DNA was isolated from leukocytes ofperipheral blood. For sample preparation, enrichment by hybridization with NimbleGen probes (Roche) was used. Results: We identi ed 140 variants in 49 genes in 48 patients with a minor allele frequency <1%. 57 variants were annotated as variants with uncertain clinical signi - cance. In 12 patients, pathogenic and likely pathogenicvariants were found PicchiaConclusions: It is necessary to conduct prospective monitoring of patients, as well as segregation analysis in families, to estimate clinical signi cance of the identi ed genetic variants. Investigation the effect of cancer- associated genes variants can help to understand the processes of carcinogenesis and individualize the treatmentand further observation and provide genetic counseling for patients and their relatives.

TRAIL pathwaycomponents 'expression patterns could possibly serve as future predictive biomarkers for patient assortment regard- ing TRAIL targeting therapies. Materials and Methods: Relative mRNA expression of TRAIL DR5, DcR1, DcR2, cFLIP, BCL2) was 90 cancer tissues, using the RT-PCR/ Ct method. The SPSSv22 package was used for statistical analysis. Results: The aforementioned genes presented elevated mRNA levels ranging from 8% to 17% of the cases and reduced mRNA levels between 31%-65% of the cases. Linear correlations were observed, indicating the simulta-neous gene expression, with the strongest found between cFLIP/DR4 (R =0,709, p < 0,001) and cFLIP/DR5 (R=0,793, TRAIL p-Stage stage with cFLIP, BCL2 , receptors 'genes.Conclusions: In our study of different components of TRAIL apoptotic pathway, relative mRNA levels correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and multiple simul- taneous expression patterns emerged. Taking into consid- eration these ndings, it is of signi cant importance to stratify breast cancer patients using predictive biomarkers inorder to maximize the ef cacy of TRAIL targeting therapies.

Kaur Johannes- burg, South Africa Introduction: Breast cancer is the most commonly diag- nosed and leading cause of cancer-related deaths amongst women globally. TAM resistance is the major challengefaced during endocrine therapy in ER +breast cancer. Several TAM resistance mechanisms have been proposed. Recently lipid reprogramming was reported to be involvedin TAM resistance. It has emerged that certain miRNAs are involved in cholesterol metabolism and cancer drug resis- tance pathways. We hypothesise that miRNAs controllingcholesterol metabolism and are potential tar- gets to be investigated in cholesterol-mediated drug resis- tance in breast cancer. Materials and methods: To investigate the role of miRNAs in cholesterol-mediated drug resistance, bioinfor- matic tools and in vitro cell based assays were utilised.Estrogen positive (ER +) breast cancer was of interest as drug resistance is a major problem in patients with ER + breast cancer. Results: Wend that inhibition of hsa-miR-128-3p with AP+TAM treatment induced cell death and decreased cholesterol levels in MCF7 cells. Through focused pathwaystudy using the RT2 pro ler microarray, we nd that genes that were differentially expressed promoted cholesterol efflux and drug metabolism while genes that mediate drug resistance were reduced. The work also highlights another potential mechanism of AP in ER +breast cancer, where it acts as a negative regulator of hsa-miR-128. Conclusions: The ndings demonstrate that targeting these miRNAs presents an opportunity for developing new strategies to combat anticancer drug resistance.

MLPA (Multiplex Ligation- dependent Probe Ampli cation) is widely used detect CNVs. Recent advancements in bioinformatics made dele- tion/duplication analysis possible within the NGS data without any further experimentation. Here, with this study,we compared the results of MLPA with CNV detection algorithm (CNV by NGS) in colorectal and breast cancer patients. Our study included 755 (683 breast-ovarian and 72 colorectal cancer) patients. MLPA test were prepared by using targeted multi-gene capture panel (coding regions and splice junctions of aforementioned genes) and sequenced byNextSeq using paired-end reads. CNV by NGS analysis was performed with Sophia DDM bioinformatics software. In 724 patients (96%) no deletion/duplication was detected in CNV by NGS, consistent with the results of MLPA. In 21 patients (2.8%), the same germline pathogenic variation was detected in both CNV by NGS and MLPAanalyses. CNV by NGS gave a false positive result in 12 patients (1.6%) and a false negative result in only 1 patient (0.13%), in which MSH6 e1 deletion was only detected with MLPA. Our experience reveals that the sensitivity of CNV by NGS is comparable to MLPA. Yet its considerably highfalse positive rates necessitate con rmation of the positivendings with an alternative method. N.B. Agaoglu: None. G. Alkurt: None. E. Celik: None. I.M. None. B. Unal: None.

RGS7 was mutated in 11% of melanomas and was found to harbor three recurrent mutations (p.R44C, p.E383K and p.R416Q). Structural modeling of the most common recurrent mutation of the three (p.R44C) predicted that it destabilizes the protein due to the loss of an H-bond andsalt bridge network between the mutated position and the serine and aspartic acid residues at positions 58 as 61, respectively. We experimentally con rmed this prediction showing that the p.R44C mutant protein is indeed destabi- lized. We further show RGS7 p.R44C has weaker catalytic activity for its substrate G o, thus providing a dual mechan- ism for its loss of function. Both of these effects are expected to contribute to loss of function of RGS7 resulting in increased anchorage-independent growth, migration andinvasion of melanoma cells. By mutating position 56 in the R44C mutant from valine to cysteine, thereby enabling the formation of a disul de bridge between the two mutated positions, we slightly increased the catalytic activity and reinstated protein stability, leading to the rescue of RGS7 s function as a tumor suppressor. Our ndings identify RGS7 as a novel melanoma driver and point to the clinical relevance of498 J. del Picchiausing strategies to stabilize the protein and, thereby, restore its function.

Puiu1 1Center of Genomic Medicine, Medical Genetics Discipline, University of Medicine and Pharmacy \"Victor Babes \", Timisoara, Romania,2Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Politehnica University Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania Large panels of genes - also called the \"clinical exome \"- are increasingly used in medical practice, where \"inci- dental \"or\"unsolicited \"ndings are common. There is a lack of consistency regarding protocols for addressing such ndings between different laboratories. The bene to f reporting secondary ndings in NGS related to cancer genes in children may have implications for family members, nevertheless, could also cause distress. Aim: to retrospectively investigate germline variants in 94 genes implicated in oncogenesis, in patients referred to NGS testing for various rare genetic diseases and reevaluatethe utility of reporting different classes of pathogenicity. Methods: We used in silico prediction software to classify variants and conducted manual review to furtherexamine secondary ndings frequencies in 229 children with rare diseases, that underwent sequencing using a 4813 gene panel. Results: The reanalysis revealed 27907 variants, of which 176 were considered after variants inATM, ATR, BLM (in two patients), SUFU andSDHB genes, presented potential cancer susceptibility, raised ethical debate in reporting them.Conclusions: In retrospect, 4.4% (10/229) of individuals in our cohort had unexpected NGS ndings related to cancer. More efforts are needed to create an updatable consensus in reporting variants in cancer predisposing genes, especially for children. Strategies are required to ensure that consent process informs of both value and riskof additional genetic information. A. Chirita Emandi: None. N. C.G. Zimbru: None. P12.040.C Somatic mutation analysis of cell-free DNA in the plasma of gastric cancer patients G. Streleckiene 1, M. Forster2, L. Kupcinskas1,J Clinical Molecular Biology, Kiel, Ger- many Introduction: Since the discovery of the circulating plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) the origin and characteristics of cfDNA were extensively studied. It was shown that cfDNAcould harbor genetic aberrations from malignant tissue. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies con- ducted in gastric cancer (GC) comparing tumor tissue DNAand plasma cfDNA mutational pro les. The aim of this study was to analyze cfDNA yield and to compare tumor tissue DNA and cfDNA mutational pro les for GC patients. Materials and Methods: GC tissue and blood were collected from 30 patients who were recruited at the Department of Gastroenterology, LUHS Hospital. Tumortissue was obtained from the primary lesion and peripheral blood was drawn before the surgery. cfDNA amount was quanti for the tissue samples and targeted sequencing for the plasma cfDNA samples. Results: Signi cantly higher yield of cfDNA was determined for GC patients. Mutations in GC related genes were detected for 76.7 % of the was created for plasma cfDNA sequencing and analysis. Finally,correlation of mutant allele frequencies between tissue and plasma cfDNA samples was determined. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that cfDNA yield is signi cantly higher in GC patients and re flects mutation prole in GC tissue, therefore may enable cfDNA analysis for monitoring of the GC patients 'disease state.

S\u00f6zer Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia(CML) is CML is associated with BCR-ABL1 located on Philadelphia chromosome[t(9;22)(q34;q11)]. Recent studies revealed that some leukemic cells might release BCR-ABL1 . Our hypothesis is; the cell-free BCR- ABL1 might transfect the susceptible cells and may trans- form them into leukemic cells. This study aims to under- stand whether endothelial cells EC could acquire cell-freeBCR-ABL1 in vitro. Materials-Methods: BCR-ABL1 positive CML cell line (K562) is cultivated and the spent media was collectedevery 96 hours, some saved for DNA isolation and rest was aliquot and stored in -80 oC.BCR-ABL1-EC line(HUVEC) was cultured with 1x105/ml density in 96-well plates for transfection. HUVEC culture media was mixed with 40 lo f K562 spent media without any nucleases and incubated for 48h at 37oC. After 48h, HUVEC was washed and detached from the plate. Following gDNA isolation, PCR analysis were performed for BCR-ABL1 .BCR-ABL1 product the haematological malig- nancies usually referred to the cancer cells migration and insertion into the different distant organs. Some studiesrevealed the theory of genometastasis; transfection of healthy cells by cell-free DNA without any induction. This study provides evidence for BCR-ABL1 insertion into the different type of cells from their origin including EC. This process might also provide some answers to other cancer prognosis as well.

Saetta 1st Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece Introduction: EGFR mutation analysis in circulating cell- free tumor DNA (cf-DNA) from plasma constitutes a con- venient and less invasive alternative method for NSCLCpatients without adequate tumor material and for disease monitoring. Materials and Methods: We examined 420 blood samples from patients with NSCLC of which 102 had also FFPE tissue tested. Circulating cell-free tumor DNA (cf- DNA) isolation from plasma and detection of EGFRmutations was performed using Cobas \u00aeEGFR mutation v2. Results: EGFR mutations in cf-DNA were detected in 26% of the samples. The most common mutations were deletions in exon 19 (62%), followed by point mutations in exon 21 (31%). A resistance mutation, p.Thr790Met wasdisplayed in 24% of the mutant cases. The presence of mutations in primary samples reached 12% whereas for follow up samples the percentage of mutations was 40%.Three out of fteen tissue samples with Invalid cobas result, showed presence of EGFR mutation in cfDNA. The presence of EGFR mutations in plasma and tumor tissueswas correlated with gender (p < 0.001, p =0.031) as were more common in female patients. The overall concordance of EGFR mutation status in plasma 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 72%. Conclusions: The to current data indicating that cf-DNA EGFR mutation testing has a veryhigh PPV. The PPV indicates that EGFR mutations could be reported with certainty, whereas the sensitivity of the test indicates that a biopsy should be obtained for patients withan EGFR mutation-negative cfDNA M.

This provides opportunities for standardized screening of both known and putative cancer predisposition syndromes(CPS) in children with cancer. This confers a challenge regarding what gene panel to use in a diagnostic setting. Methods: Criteria were developed to select genes eligible for a childhood CPS gene panel. Genes were divided into two categories: 1) genes associated with conditions that can only be caused by this speci c gene, and 2) grouped genes that give rise to the same CPS. The criteria were applied to multiple sources of in total 392 candidate genes. Results: Single genes were included in the panel when a minimum of ve children with cancer and a pathogenic variant in the gene were reported in literature. In addition, evidence must be present supporting a causal relation withthe malignancy (i.e. studies describing somatic second hits in the tumor or segregation in families). Genes were grouped if they are associated with a heterogenous CPS andif they share the same cellular pathway or mechanism. At least two genes in the group must ful ll the criteria for individual genes for the group to be included in the panel. Intotal, we included 139 genes in the childhood cancer gene panel. Conclusions: We have made criteria for the development of a childhood cancer gene panel. Currently, 139 genes are included in the gene panel. Regular updates in the future are necessary for novel genes. A. Byrjalsen: None. I.J. Diets: None. J. Bakhuizen: None. T. van K. Schmiegelow: None. A. Gerdes: None. None. P12.044.A Combination of Panobinostat and Chloroquine as a therapeutic strategy against ovarian cancer M. Ovejero-S\u00e1nchez 1,2,3, D. Iglesias-Corral2,1,3, P. Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain,2Molecular Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, 3Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer (IBMCC), Salamanca, Spain,4Institute of Molecular andCellular Biology of Cancer of Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain Introduction: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, therefore new and potent treat- ments are needed. Chloroquine is known to generate reac-tive oxygen species (ROS) causing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Some HDACi have been reported to inhibit DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). Thisstudy aims to investigate the effect of Chloroquine, Pano- binostat and their combination in the survival of different OC cell lines. Material and methods: OC cell OV-3, MTT, were performed to test chloroquineand Panobinostat anticancer activity. Synergistic interaction between these two drugs was assessed using the median dose effect analysis of Chou and Talalay, and combinationindexes were calculated. DCFH-DA staining was used to determine ROS generation. -H2AX and Rad51 foci were detected by immuno fluorescence. To analyze HR, a reporter GFP cassette was integrated into the genome of SK-OV-3 and a unique DSB was introduced by transfection with an endonuclease encoding plasmid. HR-ef ciency in the presence or absence of Panobinostat was calculated by quantifying the number flow cytometry. decreased cell viability and induced G0/G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest, respectively. The combination of both drugs caused a synergistic effect in all cell lines that was reverted by theaddition of an antioxidant. Treatment with Panobinostat decreased the ef ciency of HR due to the inhibition of Rad51 recruitment to DSBs. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the Chloroquine- Panobinostat combination could be a therapeutic strategy against OC. M. Ovejero-S\u00e1nchez: None. D. Iglesias-Corral: None. P.

BAYRAK1 1Yeditepe University, School of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey,2Yeditepe University,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 501Institute of Natural and Applied Sciences, Department of Biotechnology, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Tumorsphere formation is a widely used cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment method. The protocol is based on cultivating cancer cells on a non-attachment sur-face with speci c growth factors and absence of serum for enrichment of cancer cells with higher stem-like properties. Studies suggest that invasion and metastasis capabilities ofcancer cells are driven by increased epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) status and associated with CSC pheno- type. However, EMT characteristics of tumorsphere-derived CSCs are poorly de ned. In this study, migration/ invasion capabilities of tumorsphere-derived chordoma CSCs, and their EMT related gene expression levels areinvestigated. Materials and Methods: U-CH1 and MUG-Chor 1 Chordoma cell line derived tumorspheres were cultured onultra-low attachment plate in serum free culture medium with speci c supplements. Pluripotency and EMT related gene expression pro les were evaluated using qPCR. Migration capacity and invasiveness were assessed via tumorspheres comparing parental cell lines indicates an enriched population with high pluripo- tency. Additionally, downregulation of CK19 and upregula-tion of Twist, and ZEB1 in tumorspheres offers an epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. In contrast migration/invasion capacities of tumorsphere derived cellsare decreased, a signature EMT marker, CDH1 expression is increased. Conclusions: Our results demonstrates that tumorsphere formation assay may enrich cancer stem-like cell popula- tions with high stemness potential, but these tumorsphere- derived cells are losing their capacity to migrate, probablydue to the high CDH1 expression.

P12.046.C Genetic pro ling of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients in Estonia during 2018-2019 M. Tooming 1, Kahre1,2 1Tartu ment of Clinical Genetics, Tartu, Estonia,2University of Tartu, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Department ofClinical Genetics, Tartu, Estonia Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia in adults. Laboratory methods such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), fluor- escence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromosomalmicroarray (CMA) are used to investigate CLL patients. The aim of this study was to genetically pro le and to get an overview of genetic alterations of the CLL patients inEstonia. Patients and methods: 378 patient samples were referred to the Tartu University Hospital Clinical Genetics Centerduring 2018-2019 from 3 major tertiary referral hospitals. Patients were tested with Illumina TruSight Myeloid panel (NGS-54 genes), FISH (TP53, trisomy12, ATM deletion,DLEU1 deletion) and CMA (HumanCytoSNP-12). FISH or CMA was carried out on 343 patients. NGS was performed in 210 patients. Both NGS and FISH or CMA wasperformed in 175 patients. Results: Altogether 50/378 patients (13,2%) tested positive for TP53 mutations or del17p. TP53 pathogenic mutations were detected in 40 (19%) patients. FISH/CMA revealed 23 (6,7%) patients with del17p. 13 (3,4%) patients harboured both TP53 mutations and del17p. and by FISH trisomy12, ATM and DLEU1 deletions. Unfortunately, in 160 FISH/CMA-negative cases NGS was not performed and in 22 TP53-negative NGS cases FISH/CMA was not analysed. Conclusions: Both NGS and FISH/CMA testing should be considered to establish a status of TP53 mutation/del17p to improve patient strati cation and optimize therapeutic decisions.

Great success has been achieved in the treatment of CML due to the devel- opment of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), but 20-40% ofpatients are resistant to targeted therapy. The aim of the study is to detect exome variants predicting effectiveness of CML therapy. Materials and methods: Blood was sampled from 60 CML patients at the time of diagnosis, before starting the TKI therapy. Later, 30 of the patients matched theELN2013 criteria of optimal response, 18 were included in warning group, and 12 were resistant to therapy. Exome sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 550Sequencing System. Bioinformatic analysis included SnpEff (analysis of transcripts), ANNOVAR (analysis of allele frequencies in gnomAD, 1000G, and the ASXL1 andDNMT3A genes in 33% of patients in the group of resistant to therapy TKI, but not in other groups. 25% of patients in the treatment-resistant group had variants only in ASXL1 , variants in and DNMT3A may be associated with resistance to TKI therapy and serve as prognostic markers of the TKI therapy effectiveness at the stage of CML diagnosis, and thus provide a personalized approach to the targeted CMLtherapy.

Medicine, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, 3Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer (IBMCC), University of Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain,4Medical Oncology Service, Salamanca, Spain Introduction: Androgen receptor (AR) plays a crucial role in prostate cancer (PCa) and the presence of the receptor in blood cancer is being used as a biomarker. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a newly discovered type of endogenousnon-coding RNAs, characterized by a closed continuous loop, which can regulate gene expression by acting as microRNA or RNA-binding protein sponges. In this workwe wanted to test whether circRNAs derived from the AR gene (circ-AR) could also be detected in blood samples and used as PCa biomarker. Methods: Peripheral blood was drawn from 35 patients with diagnostic of metastasic PCa. Whole blood (10mL) was collected in EDTA tubes. Plasma was isolated from thesupernatant by centrifugation at RT, 20 minutes and 1500 rpm. Total RNA was extracted from patient serum/plasma and VCAP cell line using the miRNeasy and miRNeasyMini kits respectively. RNA samples were treated with RNase R for 30 minutes at 37\u00baC to digest linear RNA and circRNAs were isolated again. Circ-AR expression wasanalysed by qPCR using GAPDH mRNA for normalization. primers for circ-AR the CircInteractome webtool ofGAPDH Results: Circ-AR was detected by RT-qPCR in plasma PCa patients and in VCAP cell line. To validate theexistence of a circ-AR, Sanger sequencing was performed on the PCR product ampli ed with the divergent primers. Conclusions: Circ-AR was detected by RT-qPCR in all plasma samples, indicating that these molecules could be used as novel biomarkers in PCa. P. V\u00e1zquez-C\u00e1rdenas: None. A.

M.A. validation of the Droplet Digital PCR system for the detection of the most frequent clinically relevantEGFR ,BRAF andKRAS hotspot tumor variantsAbstracts from the 53rd European of Human Genetics (ESHG) - Medical Genetics Center, Munich, Germany, 2Genomics Institute, University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, United States Introduction: Precision medicine targeting speci c genetic variants in cancer can be used for prediction and prognosisof disease progression and outcome. This requires accurate molecular pro ling of the tumor, which is traditionally performed using DNA extracted from tumor tissue. Liquidbiopsies can overcome some of the challenges regarding tissue biopsies and offer several advantages like real-time monitoring of driver hotspot variants, although highlysensitive methods are required to identify these variants in ctDNA. Materials and Methods: The Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) technology requires low amounts of input DNA and enables quanti cation of low variant allele frequencies (VAF) of targeted variants, yet accuracy varies betweenassays and laboratory protocols. Results: We conducted the analytical validation of ve ddPCR assays, for the detection of the most frequentclinically relevant EGFR ,BRAF andKRAS hotspot tumor variants and established precise thresholds between negative and positive results as well as VAF quanti cation. All assays showed very low limits of blank and detection ranging from 0% to 0.11% fractional abundance and 0.08% to 0.4% VAF of the targeted variants, respectively. However, strikingdifferences were observed between ddPCR assays for the detection of low VAFs of the targeted variants. Conclusions: In particular, the observed difference in performance in low VAF variant detection and quanti cation demonstrates the importance of speci c analytical validation for each assay to obtain reliable results of ctDNA analysis.

Mensenkamp2 1Department of Clinical Genetics, University Medical Center, Maastricht, Netherlands,2Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, of Pathology, Rad- boud Medical Center, Nijmegen, NetherlandsConstitutional mismatch repair de ciency (CMMRD) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary cancer condition, characterized by early onset colorectal cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, brain tumors and other malig- nancies. We report a 24-year-old man referred to our outpatient genetic clinic because of rectal cancer. Hiss i s t e rh a dd i e do fa na s t r o c y t o m aa ta g e1 4 .T h e i rf a t h e r was diagnosed with prostate, bladder and renal cancer at age 47 and 58. A paternal uncle died of esophageal cancerat age 50, a paternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 70 and the paternal grandfather died of liver cancer at age 70. The maternal grandfather died of bladdercancer at age 77. The family history did not include additional cancer cases amongst rst or second degree relatives. Immunohistochemistry of the rectal cancershowed mismatch repair de ciency with loss of MSH2, atypical diminished staining of MSH6 and presence of patho-genic heterozygous germline ,c . 1 7 5 9 +3A>G (p.(Ser554fs)) and a deletion of the rst exon, c.

Parental testing showed that both variants were inherited from a different parent. The latter nding con- rmed CMMRD due to bi-allelic patient. Formalin- xed paraf n-embedded tissue analysis revealed that his deceased sister also car-ried both MSH2 variants.

Kamping, T. de Bitter, L. Elze, R. at adolescent and young adult age (AYA; 25 years) is a rare condition. Here we analyzed the clinicopathological and molecular features of CRC at AYA age to improve genetic counselling, surveillance and, ulti- mately, treatment and disease outcome. We retrospectivelycollected clinical information and tumor tissues from AYAs with CRC between 2000 and 2017 in the Netherlands.504 J. del PicchiaTumor DNAs were analyzed for microsatellite instability, mutations in 56 hotspot regions and/or driver genes, and genome-wide somatic copy number aberrations. A total of 139 patients (58% male) were diagnosed with CRC 25 years of age (mean age 22) between 2000 and 2017. Mucinous and/or signet-ring-cell components wereobserved in 33% of cancers. A genetic tumor risk syndrome was con rmed in 39% of cases. Negative predictors of outcome were a younger age at diagnosis, signet-ring-cellcarcinoma, the absence of a genetic tumor risk syndrome, and a diagnosis at advanced stage of disease. Compared to CRCs 60 years of age from The Cancer Genome Atlas, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs at AYA age quently harbor somatic mutations in TP53 andPOLE , less frequently APC and are enriched for nearly- diploid MSS tumor genomes. Our data suggest that CRCs at AYA age have a biology and etiology different from sporadic CRCs at older age. Therefore, treatment of AYAswith CRC should be optimized based on their molecular genetic phenotypes. Performing comprehensive sequencing of germline and tumor DNA in every individual diagnosedwith CRC 25 years of age would aid in this optimization. R.M. de Voer: None. I. Diets: None.

Due to technical limitations and variantinterpretation challenges, high penetrant pathogenic variants are frequently reported only in the exonic regions of the genes. Materials and methods: The study included 206 patients with suspected hereditary CRC referred to the Cancer Genetics Counselling Clinic at Sahlgrenska UniversityHospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. Variant screening was performed using a comprehensive genomic panel including established and also putative CRC predisposition genes(covering 50 kb upstream and downstream of genes and intron regions). Variants, including CNVs (copy-number variants), were evaluated regarding pathogenicity. Inaddition, 40 out of the 206 patients were further investigated through whole-genome sequencing (WGS).

P12.056.A A new approach for the identi cation of novel candidate genes of susceptibility to colorectal cancer A. Lopez-Novo 1, A. Dacal2, D. the (CIBERehd), Universitat Oncologia Gastrointestinal y Institut Spain Introduction: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was expected to identify genetic variation that explained themissing heritability in colorectal cancer (CRC). The strate- gies prioritization of recurrent loss-of- function rare germline variants in genes previously involvedin cancer pathways. However, not only a very small number of candidate genes with strong scienti c evidence were identi ed, but a large number were proposed whose role in colorectal tumorigenesis is not yet established. The failure to identify the real causative genes could be due to the genetic heterogeneity underlying CRC. Our aim is tomolecular characterize early-onset MMR-pro cient CRC at somatic level to further identify novel candidate genes by integrating germline and tumor omic data. Materials and Methods: WES and RNA-seq were performed on paired normal-tumor tissues from a homogeneous cohort of (<50y)MMR-pro cient expression analysis analysis (G: Proler), consensus molecular subtyping (CMSCaller) and signature pro le (MuSiCa) were carried out. Results: According to consensus molecular subtyping, colorectal tumors were as: CMS1 (3), CMS2 (2), CMS3 (4), CMS4 (6), the remaining were still not classi ed. Conclusions: These data show the molecular hetero- geneity underlying this phenotypically homogeneous cohort of early onset comprehensive prioritization of germline variants accordingto the molecular subtype of each tumor will be followed increasing the probabilities to identify the causativegermline CRC risk variants. As a result a more personalized genetic diagnostic could be achieved. Grant support: ISCIII and FEDER funds PI17/00509; Predoctoral Fellowship (GAIN, Xunta Galicia) A. Lopez-Novo: None. A.

However, the effects of GNMT polymorphisms on colorectal cancer (CRC) are still unclear. Herein, weinvestigated the role of GNMT in CRC. Materials and Methods: The study sample consists of 352 CRC patients. Clinical variables including parametersof staging, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, and age of CRC onset were collected. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including rs9471976, rs9462856,rs11752813, rs10948059, and rs2274517 were genotyped. The associations of SNPs with clinical variables were examined by a two-stage approach: chi-square test andlogistic regression were used for categorical variables; Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were used for age of onset. Results: The minor alleles of three SNPs were associated with a higher risk perineural rs9471976506 Furthermore, subjects carrying GGgenotype of rs11752813 have a younger age of onset compared with other subjects (HR =3.02, 95%CI =(1.09, 8.36)). According to GTEx database, these four mayinfluence expression levels of PEX6 GNMT in transverse and sigmoid colon tissues. Conclusions: GNMT is associated with risk of perineural invasion and age of disease onset among CRC patients.

Sheth 1, J. 2CIMS Ahmedabad, India,3Dwarika Clinic, India, 5Zydus Cancer Hospital, Ahmedabad, India,6Nishtha and Research Centre, India, 7HOC Ahmedabad, India,8Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom Microsatellite instability (MSI) and Lynch syndrome (LS) prevalence in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is estimated to be 15% and 3% in European populations. However,prevalence estimates from India are not available. We aim to systematically assess the prevalence of MSI and LS in CRC patient population from India. Venous blood andprimary tumour biopsies were prospectively collected and analysed for MSI using Promega fragment length analysis assay and with MSI- high -negative biopsies were assessed for LS using germline DNA sequencing of the MSH6, PMS2 andEPCAM ). Within 9 months of a 3 year study, 38 patients have been recruited with CRC. MSI testing in these patients showed MSI-high phenotype in 10 patients (26.3%). Of these, 9 patients(90%) were negative for BRAF V600E mutation. Germline testing in 6 of these patients have shown known and novelmutations in the MLH1 gene. Ad hoc analysis of the pro- spective study cohort suggests higher prevalence of MSI and LS in CRC patient population in India. Analysis of the entire patient cohort ( n=0) in 2022 will provide a robust estimate of the prevalence of MSI and LS in CRC patients in India. These estimates would help in formulation ofnational guidelines for MSI testing, LS diagnosis and che- moprevention strategies of CRC in India.

CRC detection rates have improved; however, disease-related mortality remains very high. Comprehensive miRNA analysis showed deregulatedmiRNA pro les in CRC. In order to understand functional relevance of miRNA deregulation, studies analyzing their target genes are of major importance. Materials and methods: MTT, colonogenic, wound healing, dual-light luciferase reporter gene, gene protein expression assays were performed in SW620, HCT-116 andCaco-2 cell lines after cell transfection with hsa-miR-1246 mimic and inhibitor to determine miR-1246 impact in cell function changes and to con rm its target genes. Results: Reduced cell viability was observed in Caco-2 and SW620 cell lines 72 hours after transfection with 1246 inhibitor. Colonogenic test results number only in Caco-2 cell line. Inhibition of miR-1246 decreased covered gap area in wound in Caco-2 and HCT-116cells. CFTR dual light luciferase assay. Overexpression miR-1246 decreased the expression ofCFTR andAXIN2 genes in SW620 cell line 48 hours after transfection. Tendency of higher CFTR and AXIN2 expression in protein level was observed after inhibitionof miR-1246 in Caco-2 and SW620 cell inhibition of miR-1246 affectedcell viability, colony formation and migration in CRC cell lines.

Patients with CRC have an increased risk for developing metachronous CRC (MCRC) during follow-up evaluation. It is still unknown which patients are prone to this condition, despite genomics stu-dies have enhanced our ability to identify molecular chan- ges associated with CRC. The clinician\u00b4s challenge is to propose a tight follow-up and control the possible return ofcancer. This study is focusing on the characterization of mutational pro le of MCRC that could inform in regards to prognosis and therapy decision. Materials and Methods: A total of 90 formalin- xed, parafn-embedded (FFPE) tumor DNA from 45 patients diagnosed with MCRC were selected to perform nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) using Ion Torrent platform and Ampliseq cancer hotspot panel v2 (Thermo sher). Data analysis was performed using Torrent Suite and IonReporter software (Thermo sher). The annotated variants were visualized using IGV (Broad Institute). Results: The most frequent mutations in initial tumors were located APC (48,9%), patients showed the same mutations in both tumors.Moreover, those patients with APC mutation in their inicial tumor showed a tendency to develop later their metachro- nous tumors (p =0,05). Conclusions: These results highlight the genetic features of MCRC that could in fluence for tailored surveillance programs. Additionally, data showed the mutational pro le differences between both tumors in MCRC patients. S. Tapial: None. D. Rueda: None. D. G\u00f3mez-S\u00e1nchez: None. N. Carrizo: None. Y.

Genetics, Medical University Innsbruck,, Innsbruck, Austria,2Faculty of Medical Sciences, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United King-dom, 3Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at508 J. del PicchiaBirmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States,4Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria Introduction: Biallelic germline mismatch constitutional MMR de ciency (CMMRD), a highly penetrant childhood cancer overlapping with neuro bromatosis type 1 (NF1). CMMRD testing in suspected NF1 children withoutNF1/SPRED1 mutations enables inclusion of CMMRD positives into monitoring programs prior to tumor onset. However, testing is associated with potential harms. Theprevalence of CMMRD among these children, although unknown, is estimated to be as low as 0.39%. Methods: We have previously developed a simple and scalable microsatellite instability (MSI) assay of non- neoplastic leukocyte DNA to reliably detect CMMRD. Here we used this assay to retrospectively screen a cohort of>700 children suspected of sporadic NF1, but lacking NF1/ SPRED1 germline mutations after highly sensitive mutation analysis. Results: three MSI-positive patients, identi cation of MMR gene germline mutations con rmed the diagnosis of CMMRD. Founder mutations NM_000535.5(PMS2):c.736_741delinsTGTGTGTGAAG, prevalent in Europe and North America, and NM_000179.2(MSH6):c.10C>G, affecting 1:400 French Canadians, represented two of ve prevalence was 3/735 (0.41%, 95% data provide reliable num- bers urgently needed for genetic counseling, and con rm previous prevalence estimations on which the Care for CMMRD (C4CMMRD) consortium guidelines are based. These advocate CMMRD testing of preselected patients rather than offering re flex testing to allsuspected sporadic NF1 children lacking NF1/SPRED1 mutations. The MMR mutations in the CMMRD patients identi ed here suggest that the possibility of founder effects should be considered, in addition to C4CMMRD guidelines, when counselingNF1/SPRED1 mutation negative children.

Up to 10% of all CRC cases are considered hereditary. Here, we aimed to characterize the spectrum of pathogenic var-iants in Turkish CRC patients and investigated the phenotype-genotype relationships of these variants. Materials and Methods: We sequenced the coding regions and splice junctions of 25 cancer susceptibility genes in 174 unrelated CRC patients and 457 elderly controls with no personal and familial cancer history usingmulti-gene panel testing. We also performed MLPA analyses for mismatch genes ( MLH1, MSH2, and EPCAM pathogenic ( n=24) of all variants were genes MLH1 (n=7),MSH2 (n=4) and MSH6 (n=2). 2 of these variants were gross deletions. MUTYH c.1437_1439delGGA variant was the most pre- valent pathogenic variant. Monoallelic MUTYH mutations were not signi cantly with colorectal cancers (p=0.2849). 47% of patients with MMR gene defects had loss of MMR gene expression in their tumors. 4% (7/174)of all patients had mutations in well-known breast cancer genes and other cancer susceptibility genes. Variants of uncertain signi cance (VUS) were detected in more than 34% of all subjects. Conclusions: This study provides important information to estimate the contribution of cancer susceptibility genes toCRC in Turkish population, and to improve the interpreta- tion of VUS.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 509E.

The extent of the del (5q) varies in individual cases. Two different commonly deleted regions (CDRs) have been published: the proximal5q31.2 region associated with a high-risk MDS, and the distal CDR 5q32-5q33 involved in the pathogenesis of MDS with isolated del(5q). However, rare cases of atypicaldeletions not including de ned CDRs have also been reported. Materials and methods: During 1993-2019 we exam- ined bone marrow cells of 3714 MDS patients by conventional G-banding and I-FISH (Abbott). Extent 920/3714 patients of them had large deletion spanning bothdened CDRs. Atypical deletions with retained CDRs were identi ed in 9/920 cases (1%; 4M/5F; median age, 73 years). In ve of them del(5q) was a sole aberration, in four cases it was detected together with other chromosomal rearrangements. In all cases, deletion was localized proximally to the 5q31 region. The size of the deletedsegment ranged from 25.46 to 53.19 Mb (median 38.51 Mb). Conclusions: Our results suggest that del(5q) may occur outside of de ned CDRs. Although these ndings are extremely rare, they show that also genes located outside known CDRs may contribute to the malignant progressionof MDS. The identi cation of these genes will lead to better understanding of the MDS pathogenesis and may contribute to identify new therapeutic targets. Supported by RVO- VFN64165, IHBT-00023736 . Z.

During disease progression gliomas undergo cel- lular and genomic evolution. However, the mechanism ofthis complicated process associated with treatment failure is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: We compared genomic pro les of 28 primary and recurrent gliomas. To assess copy number variations, IDH1/IDH2 mutation status and hyper- methylation In 27/28 cases, the genomic pro les of recurrent tumors were different from their primaries and shared the genetic/epigenetic alterations depending on the evolutionary pattern, i.e. linear or divergent. Except typical aberrations,recurrent lesions in all these patients included additional gains/losses of various parts of different chromosomes resulting in complex rearrangements. Repeatedly affectedregions were detected in bands 2q36.3, and Besides copy del Picchiaat 7p, 9p, 12p, and 17p. In one case, newly acquired chromothripsis of chromosomes 1, 9, 11 and 17 was observed. Hypermethylation of MGMT and/or MLH3 promoter was detectedin 10/28 recurrent tumors. Conclusions: Our study proved heterogenous pattern of clonal evolution in gliomas which is characterized byacquisition of new genomic aberrations and leads to high genome instability. We proved, that recurrences are genetically/epigenetically different from their primariesand may arise from one major tumor clone or by one or more subclones presented within primary tumors.

P12.067.C Development of a novel, online training platform for genomics education in cancer care; preparing health- care professionals for \"Generation Genome\" V. J. Malawana2, A. Kulkarni1 1South East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Guy 's and St Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, London, United King- dom,2Medics.Academy, London, United Kingdom,3Guy's and St Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Genomic testing in the UK is changing, with more clinicians ordering genomic tests for patient care. The UK Government has called for improved education toappropriately order and interpret tests. Existing evidence highlights the bene ts of online learning, as well as those of blended delivery approaches, and initiatives need to bescalable to the wider workforce. We developed an online platform ( Nucleus ) to address this need across for cancer healthcare professionals in our region. Materials and Methods: Collaborating with healthcare technology company, Medics.Academy, Nucleus was developed based on face-to-face education delivered byGuy's Hospital. Scoping exercises, literature reviews and recommendations from national healthcare and govern- mental bodies identi ed target audiences, training needs and the utility of online training. Content was developed and reviewed by genetics clinicians. User testing data of an initial Nucleus module was collected.Results: Modules in basics of cancer genomics, cancer genomics susceptibility, and precision oncology (technolo- gical and clinical applications) have been developed. Podcasts and blogs are currently in development. Initial user testing has been very positive with users rating the platform as relevant to practice (x =4.57/5), with appro- priate length (x =4.29/5) and pace (x =4.14/5). Conclusions: Nucleus can facilitate scalable cancer genomics education and is well-received by clinicians.Modules will be combined with face-to-face teaching in a blended learning course to be piloted in June 2020. Subsequent expansion of further modules is planned overthe next 18 months. V. Tripathi: None. A.E. Coulson: None. E. Cox: None. Z. Beydoun: None. V. Reeve: None. J. Malawana: None. A. Kulkarni: None. P12.068.A Using genetics to understand the relationship between non-cancerous gynaecological diseases and endometrial cancer risk T. A. O 'Mara 1, P. Kho1, S. Mortlock2, G. W. Montgomery2, A. B. Spurdle1, D. M. Glubb1 1QIMR Berghofer Medical Institute, Brisbane, Australia,2The Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Uni- versity of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia Endometriosis, polycystic ovary and uterine broids are three prevalent non-cancerous gynae- cological diseases, affecting women of reproductive age, with unclear effects on endometrial cancer risk. UsingGWAS summary statistics for each of these performed genetic correlation, genetic causal inference (latent causal variable and Mendelian randomization analysis) and gene-based analyses (fastBAT analysis) to understand the relationshipbetween these three non-cancerous gynaecological diseases and risk of endometrial cancer. We found positive genetic correlation between endometrial cancer and PCOS(r g=0.37, P =2\u00d7103) and endometrial cancer and uterine broids (r g=0.24, P =7\u00d7103). There was no evidence of genetic correlation between endometrial cancer and endo-metriosis. As body mass index (BMI) is a shared risk factor for PCOS, uterine broids and endometrial cancer we adjusted genetic correlation results for BMI. Upon thisadjustment, the signi cant correlation between uterine broids and endometrial cancer remained; however, the genetic correlation between PCOS and endometrial cancerAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 511was attenuated. Despite the signi cant genetic correlation observed, we did not nd evidence supporting a causal relationship between any of the three non-cancerous gynaecological diseases and endometrial cancer develop- ment. Gene-based analyses prioritized seven endometriosis andve uterine broids-associated genes that overlapped with endometrial cancer-associated genes, highlighting potential shared pathways affecting risk of these diseases. No PCOS-associated genes overlapped with endometrialcancer-associated genes. Our study provides insights into the shared relationship between PCOS, uterine broids and endometrial cancer, and avenues for future research. Fundedby NHMRC grants to TOM, ABS, GWM T.A. O the concept of a circulating tumor DNA-based clinically scalable work flow focused on ESR1 epigenetic modi cation in hormone receptor positive Metastatic Breast 1, D. Basile2, 3DAME-University have been largely explored in Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) but little isknown about their epigenetics. Aim of the study was to test the feasibility of a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based workflow focused on ESR1 mutations and promoter methylation in MBC patients (pts) treated with endocrine therapy (ET). Methods: overall, 49 pts eligible for rst line ET were prospectively enrolled. Mutations were evaluated through NGS, while the methylation of ESR1 promoter A and B (met_promA/B) was assessed through methylation-speci cddPCR. Associations between prom A/B, pathological characteristics and mutations were explored through Fish- er's exact test and Mann -Whitney test. Results: Aromatase inhibitors were the main was 38.5%, liver metastases (P =0.0211) while for met_promB no differences were observed among sites, with the exception of numerically higher levels in pts with soft tissueinvolvement. Met_promA was signi cantly lower in pts with ESR1 mutations (median 41 vs 25 for ESR1 wild-type and mutated; P =0.0091) and numerically lower in pts with aPIK3CA mutation (median 40.5 vs 24 for PIK3CA wild- type and mutated). Three clusters were de ned by combining met_promA and B, with a signi cant association between PIK3CA mutations and Cluster1 (P =0.0025). Conclusions: The study showed feasibility of a ctDNA-based epigenetic evaluation. Intriguingly, differen-tial methylation levels were observed across baseline features, suggesting a broader impact of epigenetic modulation of ESR1 in breast cancer biology. A. Franzoni: None. D.

P12.075.B Identi cation of modi er and dependency genes for human hereditary cancer syndromes using CRISPR/ Cas9 mediated genome editing allows gene ruption experiments in a multitude of organisms. Xenopus tropicalis shares with zebra sh an aquatic habitat and easy manipulations associated with its external development.However, unique features make it a favorable and powerful organism for human disease modeling. Unlike zebra sh, Xenopus tropicalis has a true diploid genome. Hence, gene disruption studies are not suffering from redundancy. Its genome shows high synteny with humans, assisting iden- tication orthologs of human genes. Targeted injection of512 J. del Picchiaindividual blastomeres allows manipulations of speci c tissues and organs. We generated the rst genetic cancer models in Xenopus tropicalis . Upon mosaic targeting of the tumor suppressor gene Apc using CRISPR/Cas9, tadpoles rapidly (< 1.5 months) and Rb1/Rbl1 double mosaic mutant tadpoles rapidly develop retinoblastoma. Mostrecently we documented the generation of Tp53 hetero- zygous leukemia and kinetics of tumor development in the tadpoles/froglets pave the way for their use as pre-clinical models. These cancer models pro-vide unique possibilities for identi cation of modi er and dependency genes using multiplexed injections ( e.g. tumor suppressor gene +candidate depen- dency gene). We present our results with multiplexed gene targeting in a FAP associated desmoid tumor model Thesegenetic Xenopus tropicalis models offer a unique experi- mental platform in the eld of human cancer research and medical genetics.

De Leeneer 1,2, T. Belgium, 4Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium We validated and implemented a custom panel of 66 genes associated with familial cancer syndromes. Target enrich- ment was done by SeQCap EZ Hypercap (Roche) followed by sequencing on a Miseq or a Novaseq (Illumina) instru-ment. Data analysis was performed with an in house developed pipeline, allowing to limit the analysis to sub- panels speci ed by the clinician. In total, 1522 patients referred to our hospital for clinical testing were investigated. We analyzed the following subpanels: panels were analyzed for some patients, depending on personal and/or family history. In 270 patients (18%) a variant (Class V, Class IV) was detected in the requested panel. Our diagnostic yield increased with 3% ( n=47) compared to what we would have obtained if we had applied our previous panels for these indications. Thisincrease is mainly attributable to the expansion of the panels with moderate risk genes, like ATM (19 pathogenic variants detected), BRIP1 (7 pathogenic variants) and CHEK2 (6mutations other than c. 1100delC) in our HBOC panel. Interestingly, we also identi ed several variants in genes associated with also allowed to detect several mosaic patients (TP53) or patients displaying clonalhematopoiesis in their lymphocytes (TP53, ATM).

Sweet Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, United States Although family history remains an essential tool for assessment of risk, diagnostics and prevention, it is often not systematically collected or assessed in clinical settings. Thus, individuals at increased risk for common diseasessuch as cancer and/or coronary heart disease (CHD) might not be identi ed or referred appropriately. A web-based tool known as Family Health Link which assesses familial cancer and CHD risk was made available for the general public (2010-2018) and as part of patient registration (2014-2018) with over 200,000 users. A one-page anonymous user sur-vey was made available on the website during a one-month period (Jan-Feb 2018). Of 502 survey participants, 460 (91.6%) found FHL easy to use; 476 (94.8%) felt theassessment was easy to understand; and 365 (72.7%) found the assessment accurate and complete. 337 (67.1%) felt the program helped the user to learn more about cancer andCHD disease risk; 421 (83.8%) would encourage a family member to use the program, and 377 (75.1%) planned to talk to their healthcare provider about their risk. QualitativeAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 513research on patient users showed that certain aspects of FHL could be executed more effectively, to include increased opportunity for personalization of the web interface and risk messaging. FHL version 3.0 is under development and will allow for 1) automatic integration and updating of profes- sional guidelines (e.g. NCCN guidelines for hereditarycancer); 2) expansion as a mobile application and for EPIC electronic health record integration; and 3) capacity to deliver tailored, evidence-based risk messages.

Although truncating mutations in the APC gene are the most common defects in FAP patients, recent papers indicate that in asignicant number of cases the disease develops due to large deletions that cannot be detected with routine testing. Here we describe two novel germline large deletions of theAPC gene detected in 4 unrelated families presenting a severe FAP phenotype. The deletions were characterized using MLPA, high-resolution and 139.889bp) had a 5 'breakpoint in intron 4 of the APC gene and a 3 'breakpoint in intron 4 of the SRP19 gene, indicating that these regions are prone to recombination errors and might also be frequently affected by somatic rearrangements in sporadic CRC. RT-PCRanalysis showed that the deletions resulted in the production of a hybrid APC-SRP19 transcript with an ORF of 550 AA, with ~92% sequence homology with the ZRSR2 gene. TheZRSR2 gene codes for the U2 small nuclear ribonucleo- protein auxiliary factor 35kD subunit-related protein-2, which plays an important role in RNA splicing.

P12.084.B Investigating the role of CD44v6 in Gastric Cancer: development of exon-v6 skipping models by CRISPR/ Cas9 (GC) is the 5thmost common cancer and 3rdwith highest mortality. Standard of care for advanced disease is conventional chemotherapy. CD44v6- containing isoforms are de novo expressed in GC, are oftencorrelated with cancer aggressiveness, and may predict chemotherapy response in vitro. Whether expression of CD44v6-containing variants, or presence of exon-v6 per sein these isoforms, determine tumor behavior and therapy response is unknown. This is relevant for therapeutic design and constitutes our main aim. Materials and Methods: Using CRISPR/Cas9, we specically deleted exon-v6, whilst maintaining the reading frame, from two GC cell lines endogenously expressingCD44v6. Edited cell lines were characterized and treated with cisplatin and 5- fluorouracil. Cell survival was compared to wtcontrols. Results: We obtained homozygous edited cell lines lacking exon-v6 that maintained expression of remaining CD44 variant portions. Edited cells 'transcripts resulted in frame v5-v7 splicing, mimicking complete exon-v6 skip- ping. Drug treatments 'results demonstrate that removing specically exon-v6 does not affects GC cells chemother- apy response, however, skipping exon-v6 is suf cient to impair GC cells self-renewing and decrease proliferation levels. Moreover, CD44v6-containing isoforms knockdownmodulates cell survival in GC cells. Conclusions: We successfully designed exon-v6 skip- ping models in GC cells lines. These exon skipping modelsare extremely important to disclose exon-v6 speci c role in GC chemotherapy response. We conclude that CD44v6- containing isoforms modulate cell survival in GC cells and,furthermore, exon-v6 is capable of, by itself, altering one of514 J. del Picchiacancer hallmarks by decreasing the G.

Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common diseases worldwide. The composition of the molecular pro les of this disease is still not fully under- stood. ARID1A andFAT4 were identi ed as novel driving genes with a pivotal role in GC pathogenesis. In this study, we used Sanger and gene panel exome sequencing (GPES)to assess the incidence rate of somatic mutations in FAT4 and ARID1A in a cohort of Omani patients with GC and compared results to the TCGA and GEPIA databases. Methods: DNA from 75 samples were subjected to GPES as well as Sanger sequencing to screen for alterations in ARID1A and FAT4 . In addition, we used different bioinformatics tools to retrieve TCGA data for 117 and 119 cases mutated in FAT4 and ARID1A , respectively. Mutations and deletions were subsequently correlated withclinical-pathological features and survival data. Results: GPES data revealed that 44.2% of patients displayed deletions within the ARID1A gene, and 27.9% carried mutations. Samples from 20.9% of patients were found to have deletions in FAT4 , and 37.2% displayed variations. Sanger sequencing analysis of FAT4 identi ed novel missense mutations in 8% of cases and genomic deletions in exon-17 in 21.3% of samples. In silico analysis of tertiary protein structures, predicted alterations in twodomains that contained mutations. Conclusions: A markedly higher frequency of mutations/ deletions in ARID1A and FAT4 genes were found in GC patients from the Middle East region, re flecting the importance of genetic background component variation among different ethnic groups.

These markers are used as prognostic factorsand prediction of chemotherapy and immunotherapy efcacy. Materials and Methods: FFPE tumor samples and clinical information from 150 gastric cancer patients treated in N.N. Blokhin NMRCO in 2010-2019 have been investigated. Five quasimonomorphic mononucleotide mar-kers were used for the detection of MSI status. EBV status has been determined by the quantitative Real-time-PCR. Results: The clinicopathological characteristics of the gastric cancer patients and their association with the presence of EBV and MSI status are shown in Table 1.

GenapSys Inc, Redwood City, CA, United StatesNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized basic biological and clinical research, espe-cially in oncology. NGS cancer assays are used to determine cancer predisposition, identify tumor mutations, monitor treatment response and develop personalized therapies.Here, GenapSys presents a scalable, low cost, and high accuracy sequencing platform based on electrical impe- dance detection. We demonstrate that Chips with 1M, 16Mand 144M sensors can be run on the same GenapSys instrument, with greater than 99% raw accuracy and an average read length of about 150bp. We highlight itsapplications for oncology research, using diverse cancer panels on reference and clinical samples. We tested hybrid-capture and multiplex PCR-based cancer panels on a range of DNA sources, including oncology reference standards derived from cell line DNA, cfDNA standards, clinical samples: FFPE, fresh frozentumor tissue, and blood. For hybrid-capture libraries, we used the IDT xGen Pan Cancer and Exome Researchpanels. We detected low frequency mutations in the range of 1%-24.5% across multiple reference standards with the cancer panel, and observed high correlation in allele frequency with expected values (R2 > 0.99). Similar results were obtained with the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. Whole exome sequencing and pan cancer sequencing ofclinical FFPE, frozen blood samples showed high concordance (F1-score 95% - 99%) of SNV mutation calling with industry standard technology. Thus, wedemonstrate that the GenapSys Sequencing Platform is an accurate, scalable, and low cost solution for oncology research on a wide range of sample types and NGS assays. M. Fallahi: A.

However, their contribution to the pathogenesis of rare gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)is not well de ned yet. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-375 - a well-known tumor-suppressive miRNA - in the pathogenesis of GIST. Materials and Methods: MirVana miRNA mimic and negative control were transfected to the GIST-T1 cell line using the lipofection technique. Target gene and proteinexpression were detected by RT-qPCR and Western Blot, respectively. Alterations in cell viability, migration rate and516 J. del Picchiaapoptotic cell counts, as well as miRNA-target gene interaction, were evaluated by MTT, Wound Healing, Annexin V FITC and Dual-Light Luciferase assays, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using the computing environment R. Results: Overexpression of miR-375 reduced levels of KIT gene mRNA (1.9-fold, p < 0.05) and protein (1.4-fold, p < 0.05) in GIST-T1 cell line. Further functional analysis revealed a signi cant effect of miR-375 on cell viability (reduced by 47%, p < 0.05) and migration rates (reduced by up to 28% in different time points, p < 0.05). GIST-T1 cells with KIT 3 'UTR construct (pos855-861) showed decreased luciferase activity down to miR-375 was overexpressed. Conclusions: Ourndings indicate that miR-375 could suppress GIST by targeting KIT and contribute to the pathogenesis of GIST.

K\u00fcchler1, mesenchymal tumours in the gastrointestinal tract. The incidence is estimated at 4.3 - 22 cases per million.GISTs are primarily sporadic (85 - 90%) caused by somatic activating mutations in the KITorPDGFRA genes, or less commonly BRAF orRAS.SDH gene inactivation is involved in about 2%. Mutations in the Neuro bromin gene (NF1) were found in 6 - 9%. Clinicians should always consider a germline condition, as our illustrative casedemonstrates. Here we report a patient (55y) who suffered from weight loss, intermittent sweating at night and postprandialabdominal pain. Computer tomography revealed a massive duodenal tumour (14x9x9 cm). The excised GIST was tested negative for mutations in KIT,PDGFRA andBRAF . No pathogenic germline (NM_001042492.2) was identi ed in the NF1 gene. Subsequent clinical examinations revealed multiple nodular skin alterationsmost likely representing neuro bromas and several pale caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. It is remarkable that the syndromic condition of this patient was missed until the genetic diagnosis was made. The diagnosis in such patients is complicated by the high de novo mutation rate of about 50%. Therefore it is important,to consider neuro bromatosis type I also upon the apparently sole appearance of rare manifestations. Finally, patients with a subtle cutaneous phenotype are still at highrisk of developing severe tumours. B.S. K\u00fcchler: None. W. Heinritz: None. A. Bier: None. S. Reif: None. C.

With exception of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, little is known about predisposing factors underlying familialaggregation of glioma cases. In this study, we aim to identify rare glioma predisposing variants for exome sequen- cing of 13 individuals (8 affected and 5 unaffected family members) from four Finnish glioma families with 50Xcoverage using blood-derived DNA. We called germline variants by using an in-house developed and GATK pipeline. Variants were ltered based on population allele frequency and functional annotation. Variants, which were shared by all genotyped affected members in at least one family, were validated by targeted sequencing in 15additional glioma families. A total of 115 known glioma- related variants were also covered with targeted sequencing. We are currently analysing targeted sequencing data. Results: A total of 470 variants were identi ed in four glioma families after exome sequencing. Majority ofAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 517variants were private mutations within one family (86%). A total of 8 variants were shared between affected cases and present in two to four families. No familial glioma- associated DNA copy number variants were detected. Preliminary analysis of targeted sequencing revealed that 24% of variants were shared between two or more familiesand 41% were not detected in any family. Conclusions: Our results indicate that Finnish glioma families carry both private mutations and mutations whichare shared between families. The role of variants as predisposing factors of glioma will be further evaluated. R. Nurminen*: None. E. Afyounian*: None. J. Tuominen: None. M. Scaravilli: None. M. Saarinen: None. M. Annala: None.

First-degree relatives of MM patients have 2 to 4 times higher risk ofMM. Previous studies have identi ed 24 genomic loci associated with MM risk. However, these loci only explain 15 to 20% of the heritability, indicating that the molecularbasis of MM predisposition is incompletely understood. Materials and Methods: To identify MM risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study in the Nordicregion totalling 5,320 cases and 422,289 controls from Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.Results and conclusions: We found a new MM risk associated locus at chromosome 13. Further analysis using blood and plasma cell eQTL data identi ed several potential candidate genes at the locus, as well as a likely causal variant mapping to a regulatory element that is selectively open in plasma cells. Our study increases the number ofknown MM risk loci to 25. Grants and fellowships: Swedish Research Council (2018-00424), Cancer ment (full or part-time); Modest; Amgen Genetics. A.

In contrast to traditionalsingle-gene methods, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a molecular diagnostic methodology that can study multiple518 J. del Picchiaregions of genomic tumor DNA in a single assay. Since 2019, over 500 analyses were routinely performed with a com- mercial panel allowing the analysis of 30 genes (Myeloid solutionby SOPHiA GENETICS). Our experience is pre- sented here. Some clinical cases were selected, for which the results of the NGS analysis have contributed either to animprovement in patient management, or to call into question the diagnostic or prognostic value of the molecular anomalies observed. In particular, the diagnostic value of CHIPs (ClonalHematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential) and the impact of double mutations JAK2/CALR and JAK2/MPL in the pro- gression of myeloproliferative neoplasia are reviewed. Inaddition, the CNV information provided by NGS is useful for the characterization of these diseases and complements the cytogenetic result.

To identify epigeneti- regulated miRNAexpression after HDAC inhibition in HCC cell lines. Amongst others, miR-129-5p to be re-expressed after histone acetylation. MiR-129-5p has been shown to act tumor suppressive in several tumor entities and we aimed to investigate its role in HCC tumorigenesis. Materials and Methods: After transfection HLF, Huh7, HepG2) with miR-129-5p, tumor- relevant functional effects were analyzed using in vitroassays and a xenograft mouse model. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF ) as a direct target of miR-129-5p. HDGF expression and survival data of public HCC datasets were analyzed. Cancer-related functions of siRNA-mediated knockdown. Results: MiR-129-5p increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Direct binding of miR-129-5p to the HDGF -3'UTR via a noncanonical binding site cell HCC cells. Overexpression of HDGF in Wnt-inactive HCCs. Conclusions: HDAC inhibition induces expression of the tumor suppressor miR-129-5p which plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating HDGF .

The aim of this study was to identify recurrent somatic alterations in HNSCC that could be relevant in cancer initiation, progression or strati cation. Patients and methods: Tumour samples from 98 patients included in clinical trial TTCC-2007-01 were used. All patients presented locally advanced epidermoid carcinomas(non-metastatic stages III and IV) at different locations; oral hypopharynx WebGestalt software), to detect genome-wide copy number variations and loss of heterozygosity. Results and tion in 1q21.3, identi ed in 58% of the samples to be particularly interesting. Gene enrichment analysis in this region revealed a signi cant association with processes related to epithelial development. Region 1q21.3 contains FLG, IVL and LOR genes, that codify proteins highly expressed in the epithelium. Germinal mutations in thesegenes have been associated with genodermatosis suggesting that their somatic alteration could also be involved in the pathogenesis of HNSCC. Conclusion: The chromosomic region 1q21.3, LOR genes, is recurrently ampli ed in HNSCC. The present study brings new data to HNSCCresearch widening the spectrum of changes that could help to identify critical regions for tumorigenesis. Funded by FIS-FEDER:PI18/01476.N.

The regulatory potential of tumor suppressormiRNAs represents an interesting option for cancer ther- apeutics. It has been shown that overexpression of miR- 449a reduces tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinomain vivo and in vitro. However, only few direct target genes of miR-449a have been validated to date. Therefore, we analyzed the targetome of miR-449a to decipher the largenetwork of target genes and involved signaling pathways in order to understand its role in hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: HLE cells transfected with miR-449a were high-throughput sequencing. Luciferase were performed to PEA15 ,PPP1CA and TUFT1 as direct targets of miR-449a. Expression of these genes in correlation with survival data in public HCC datasets was analyzed. Cancer-related functional effects of PEA15 . Results: Ago-RIP-Seq identi ed 183 genes as direct targets of miR-449a. Seven genes were selected for further investigation, as they are potential tumor suppressorsaccording to manual literature search. Reduced mRNA expression following miR-449a overexpression was con- rmed in all of these genes. Direct binding of miR-449a to the 3'UTR of PEA15 survival. Conclusions: Ago-RIP-Seq is a promising method to decipher the network of micro-RNA target genes. Here, we identi ed several new miR-449a targets providing potential targets for cancer therapy.

Kulkarni1, L. Izatt1, V. 1Clinical Genetics Service, Guy 's and St Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom,2School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom Introduction: Making an evidence based decision about risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) is complex. We devel-oped and audited an algorithm for women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, a negative breast cancer susceptibility gene test and a high-risk breast cancer family history requestingRRM. This incorporates current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Familial Breast Cancer Clinical guideline [CG164] (2013) and the ndings from Reiner et al . (2013 and 2018) who found that women diagnosed <45 years had a high risk of developing a second primary breast cancer when they had a rst degree relative (FDR) with breast cancer. Methods and materials: 39 women with breast cancer diagnosed <45 years old, a negative breast cancer suscept-ibility gene test and a FDR with breast cancer were identi ed out of 213 women who had genetic testingbetween 2017-2019. A BOADICEA risk score was calculated to determine the risk of a second breast cancer in these women. Results: We present ndings that highlight a lack of correlation between the used risk strati cation sources, including BOADICEA and Reiner et al. (2013 and 2018). Conclusions: We conclude that clinicians can utilise scenario-based guidance to assist in making decisions about RRM in affected individuals for speci c high-risk family histories, which is derived from the use of validated tools such as BOADICEA and also prospective data from the literature. Outcome: We propose using an audited categorised approach to surgical RRM decision-making in women with unilateral breast cancer, which incorporates personal andfamily history based guidance. A.

They have also introduced the necessity for inter- and intra-population genetic/genomic data recording, in order to capture variation between and withinpopulations. National genetic variation registries could serve both ends by vastly increasing the level of detail for the relevant population, while directly affecting local patientmanagement. Methods: We report CanVaS, a Cancer Variation reSource aiming to document the genetic variation of cancer patients inGreece. Currently, CanVaS comprises germline genetic dataAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 521from ~11,000 Greek cancer patients, analyzed for the presence of variants in 1-94 cancer susceptibility genes. Results: The dataset incorporates functionally coding variants and variants in non- coding loci. For each variant, allele frequency for the Greek population, clinical signi cance interpretation and anon- ymized family, segregation information, and phenotypic traits of the carriers are included. Moreover, it provides information on the geographic distribution of the variantsacross the country, enabling the study of Greek population isolates. Direct comparisons between Greek (sub)popula- tions with relevant genetic resources is supported, allowingne-grain localized adjustment of guidelines and clinical decision-making. Most importantly, anonymized data are available for download, while our rst priority is integra- tion/interconnection with other resources, such as the Leiden Open Variation Database. Conclusions: CanVaS can become a stepping-stone for a countrywide effort to characterize the cancer mutation landscape, concurrently supporting national and interna- tional cancer research.

P12.105.B Non-Lynch familial nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is partially CRC-associated low risk variants L. of Biomarkers and Susceptibility, Cancer Prevention andControl Program, Catalan Institute of Oncology; Oncobell Program, the genetic predisposition to col- orectal cancer (CRC) cannot be explained by pathogenic variants in known high/moderate-penetrance cancer- predisposing genes. Here we aim to investigate whetherpart of the genetically unexplained familial/early-onsetCRC cases may be attributed to the accumulation of low risk alleles for CRC. Material and methods: A weighted polygenic risk score (wPRS) based on 95 CRC risk alleles identi ed and validated through genome-wide association studies (Huyghe et al. Nature genetics 2018), was determined in421 familial/early-onset unrelated CRC patients (fCRC), 1,077 sporadic CRC patients, and 1,642 cancer-free controls. Logistic regression was used to model the risk.Two-sided t-test was applied to compare means among cohorts. Additionally, we grouped individuals (fCRC and controls) into 20 quantiles. Odds ratios (OR) were estimatedtaking the quantile 10 as reference. Results: The average wPRS was statistically higher in fCRC patients compared to either controls (P t-test=2.2e-16), with an OR of 22.8, or sporadic CRC patients (P t-test=0.004). Familial CRC patients in the highest (20th) wPRS quantile were at a four-fold increased CRC risk than those in themiddle (10th) quantile. The frequency of high-wPRS fCRC patients who had developed multiple (synchronous or metachronous) colorectal tumors and that had familial CRChistory was higher than in low-wPRS patients. The heritability explained by the studied alleles was of 37.48% for fCRC. Conclusions: The accumulation of low risk CRC alleles may explain a relevant proportion of familial/early-onset CRC cases without germline pathogenic variants in known hereditary cancer genes. L.

James3, Australia Introduction: In 2016 the Parkville Familial Cancer Centre at the Royal Melbourne Hospital introduced panel based genetic testing to screen for hereditary cancer syndromes. Multigene panel tests allow simultaneous screening forpathogenic variants in multiple cancer predisposition genes and replaced iterative single gene tests, which proved to be slow, inef cient and expensive. This study seeks to validate the clinical testing criteria used by the Familial Cancer Centre and to identify areas of improvement to increase overall clinical utility. Materials and Methods: This study used a tailored database extraction to collate panel testing results over a 28- month period, and these results were analysed in conjunc-tion with relevant patient data, such as primary cancer type,age of diagnosis, family history, and relevant phenotypic features. Results: A total of 757 patients met testing criteria for state funding, and were offered panel testing relevant to their cancer diagnosis and/or family history. Pathogenic variants were detected in 13% ( n=101). Individual panel yield varied, with a trend suggesting that clear concomi- tant phenotypic features, such as skin signs with renal cancer, increased the likelihood of a panel yielding apositive result. Positive results also varied by speci c cancer pathology. Of patients presenting with a primary breast cancer ( n=335), 12% had a pathogenic mutation. The mutation pickup rate for a triple hormone-receptor negative breast cancer n=was 18%, but only 10% for breast cancers with at least one hormone-receptor positive pathology result ( n=237). Conclusions: This project demonstrates that ongoing review of publicly funded testing is warranted. R. Sheridan: None. M. Bogwitz: None. P. James: None. I.

The leading types are lung, breast, color- ectal, prostate and stomach cancers. 18.1 million new caseswere diagnosed globally in 2019 and only 5-10% of them are attributed to hereditary factors. Genetic testing can be offered not only to identify the individuals 'cancer risk, but also to enable the possibility of molecular targeted thera- pies. Here, we report the retrospective analysis of a single institution 's 3-year experience of oncopanel sequencing, which targets 94 genes and 284 SNPs, carried out by using peripheral blood samples. 125 unrelated patients with a male:female ratio of 1:4 (mean age 40(sd 6,51)) werescreened. Our studies showed that 72% of the cases have at least one variant classi ed as pathogenic, possibly patho- genic or of unknown signi cance in targeted regions. Pathogenic variants were detected in 12%, and possible pathogenic variants were detected in 18% of the cases.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 523CHEK2 andATM were detected as most common genes in patients with pathogenic mutations. Although pathogenic variant detection rate is relatively high, variants of unknown signicance (VUS), which were found in 42% of the cases, are also needed to be evaluated carefully, especially in hereditary forms of cancer. It is obvious that more researchon VUS and assessment of their effect on cancer develop- ment is essential to shed light to underlying pathogenicity and medical management. E. Yilmaz: None. E.

Due to the implementation of multi-gene panel testing, TP53 variants have been detected in individuals without LFS suspicion, e.g. colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We aim to decipher whether these ndings are the result of detecting background population pre- valence or the etiologic basis of CRC. Materials and Methods: TP53 mutational screening was performed in 473 familial/early-onset CRC cases. Our ndings were analyzed together with results from ve additional studies that evaluated the prevalence of TP53 germline variants in CRC patients (total n =6,200). Data from control population and LFS cases were obtained from gnomAD and the IARC TP53 database, respectively. Allvariants were reclassi ed according (both applying the rule speci cations (v.1) provided by the ClinGen TP53 Panel, automatically using PathoMan). Results: (Likely) pathogenic variants were identi ed in 0.03% of controls and ~0.21% of CRC patients (p < 0.0001), none of whom ful lled the clinical criteria established for TP53 testing. Loss-of-function/splice-site variants were signi cantly associated with CRC as compared with controls (OR =19; p <0.001). Compared to LFS, enrichment of this type of variants and of variants with no dominant negative effect was observed in CRC patients. Conclusions: TP53 pathogenic variants should not be unequivocally associated with LFS. The association with CRC risk may be explained by the absence of dominant negative effects and/or the loss-of-function nature of thevariants. M. Terradas: None. P. G.J. P.M. I. None. M.

Material: DNA from 110 men with PC from all over Poland and from 110 men - healthy volunteers. Methods: Sequencing, AS-PCR, RFLP-PCR, multiplex- PCR. Results: The percentage of men with 1 change was higher in PC group (61,8%) than in healthy men (52,3%) ( p =0,15). The presence of at least two changes was associated with shorter patient survival than the presence of one or no change ( p=0,14). The G84E of HOXB13 was detected in 2,9% of PC men and in no healthy man524 J. del Picchia(p=0,19, trend, OR =7,21). The average age at PC onset of men with CYP1B1 432GG and PON1 55AA originated from Hereditary Prostate Cancer Families (HPC) was signicantly younger than the age of men with these variants from families without HPC (respectively: p=0,0077, p=0,0350). Conclusions: The presence of at least one genetic change is an unfavorable factor in PC. The presence of 2 changes may be associated with shorter survival. The HOXB13 (G84E) are probably associated with PC development and with hereditary form of the disease. The CYP1B1 (432GG) andPON1 (55AA) are associated with younger age at PC onset in men from HPC families. The HOXB13 (G84E), NOD2 (3020insC) and PON1 (55AA) are assiciated with shorter overall survival. This study was supported by the found of the Collegium Medicum. M. Heise: None. P. Jarzemski: None. A.

P12.113.A Evaluation of the clinical impact of a questionnaire- based self-assessment family history of colorectal cancercompared to a professional pedigree survey S. I. J. Hospital of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbin- gen, Germany Introduction: The\"German Cancer Society \"is providing a questionnaire-based risk-score to delineate persons at risk for familial colorectal cancer, intended for easy use by non-geneticists in daily routine with colon cancer patients. The intention is to support therapists in detecting patients that should undergo a genetic counselling regarding hereditarytumour predisposition syndrome. The monocentric study aimed to analyse and evaluate the value of this score compared with a standard three-generation pedigreeanalysis. Material and Methods: Starting in June 2018, 100 colorectal cancer patients treated at the University T\u00fcbingenwere randomly picked over a 14 months period. After patients completed the questionnaire, a pedigree and a survey on the comprehensibility of the questionnaire wereconducted. Pedigrees and available histopathological data were then evaluated according to the Bethesda andAmsterdam guidelines and analysed for other familial tumour syndromes. The results were compared to the self- assessment risk-score. Results: In 41/100 patients the questionary screening approach indicated a familial colorectal cancer risk compared to 22 patients by pedigree analysis. Into thepositive questionary group fell 16/22 of these patients. In 9 cases the family trees identi ed criteria for other familial cancer syndromes. Conclusions: The questionnaire is a valuable screening tool for identifying family risk of colorectal cancer. In order to exploit the full potential of the questionnaire, it isadvisable to use it with a medical or professional perspective and assistance, because sensitivity and speci - city is signi cantly lower compared to pedigree analysis.

Regardless of age, GB is incurable and associated with poor prognosis. Because of its highly invasive nature, it isimpossible to remove all tumour cells during surgical resection, making relapse inevitable, thus, GB treatment presents one of the greatest challenges. Molecular datareveal signi cant differences between the paediatric and adult GBs, e.g. recurrent somatic mutations in some histone variants. The aim of the study was to determine differencesin gene expression among paediatric and adult GB, sug- gesting the possible reason for failures of immunotherapy in GB. Materials and methods: Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 525normal human astrocytes were used as a reference. RNA was harvested and the gene expression level was deter- mined using RT-PCR. Selected genes with proven involve- ment for immunotherapy response have been analysed. Results: Of all 27 analysed genes, only a small fraction seems to be expressed in GB, some of which were notanalysed in GB literature so far. Expression of those seem to be higher in paediatric GB, e.g. BACH2 and IL-6R. Conclusions: Most of the genes involved in the formation of immunological synapse are signi cantly down-regulated or not expressed at all in GB, providing the potential explanation for many failures of checkpoint inhibitorsimmunotherapy in GB. However, differences in gene expression might favour paediatric GB over adult GB as a candidate for future research leading to the successfulimmunotherapy. R. Mehrian-Shai: None. D.

Case description: We describe a 43-year-old male with germline pathogenic variants in TP53 andRAD51C located incison chromosome 17, who has so far not developed any tumors of the LFS-spectrum. Instead, he developed asebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC), without detection of mismatch repair de ciency, which is the only known causeof SGC to date. These ndings are replicated by a - Rad51c -double-mutant develops tumor spectrum. Methods: Variants were identi ed using tumor panel next generation sequencing. Phasing of the two variants wasdone using short tandem repeat analysis. Conclusions: In line with the observations in Trp53 - Rad51c -double mutant cismice, we propose that the human incisco-occurrence of pathogenic TP53 and RAD51C variants substantially transforms phenotype to predisposition to SGC.

We have performed a proof-of principle study to test the applicability in the clinical setting, analysing copy number alterations(CNAs) in plasma and tumour tissue from 44 patients with gastro-oesophageal cancer. Methods: DNA was isolated from blood plasma and a tissue sample from each patient. Array-CGH was applied to the tissue DNA. The cell-free plasma DNA was sequenced by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing using a clinicalpipeline for non-invasive prenatal testing. WISECONDOR and ichorCNA, two bioinformatic tools, were used to process the output data and were compared to each other. Results: Cancer-associated CNAs could be seen in 59% (26/44) of the tissue biopsies. In the plasma samples, a targeted approach analysing 61 regions of special interest ingastro-oesophageal cancer detected cancer-associated CNAs with a z-score >5 in 11 patients. Broadening the analysis to a whole-genome view, 17/44 patients (39%) hadcancer-associated CNAs using WISECONDOR and CNAs, 14 (54%) had correspond- Potentially clinically actionable526 J. del Picchiaampli cations overlapping the genes VEGFA, EGFR and FGFR2 were detected in the plasma from three patients. Conclusions: We conclude that low-coverage whole- genome sequencing without prior knowledge of the tumour alterations could become a useful tool for cell-free tumour DNA analysis of total CNAs in plasma from patients withgastro-oesophageal cancer.

Growth factors contribute to cell growth, differ-entiation, angiogenesis, and most signi cantly tumor formation in many types of cancers. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship of broblast growth factor 10 ( FGF10 ) and FGF10AS expression clin- icopathological features in CRC advancement. Methods & Materials: This study was navigated on 100 CRC tumoral and parallel adjacent normal tissues. The expression levels of FGF10 andFGF10AS were evaluated by the q-RT PCR method. For ndings validation, expression levels were measured in HCT116 and SW480 cell lines. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed systematically for FGF10 expression appraisal. Results: A substantial increase and decrease in expression levels were perceived in FGF10 (P < 0.001 )a n d FGF10AS (P>0 . 0 2 ) in tumoral tissues, in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues. Besides, upregulation of sense and down- regulation of antisense were P<0 . 0 2 andP< 0.04) and differentiation ( P < 0.01 andP<0 . 0 2 ) respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the prognostic value of FGF10 was about 0.84 (95% con dence interval, 0.771- 0.912). The results of linear regression analysis con rmed a negative correlation between FGF10 AS expression and sense transcript. ( r=0.02) Conclusion: The relationship between the expression levels of FGF10 and FGF10AS in tumoral and adjacent normal tissues indicated that sense and antisense FGF RNAs could be remarkable prognostic biomarkers forachieving effective treatment and higher survival rates.

S. deletions within the putative tumor suppres- sorLSAMP are rare in primary neuroblastomas but common in cancer cell lines from diverse origin L. M\u00f6sle1, H. Christiansen2, S. Ackermann3, A. Weber1 Leipzig, Germany, 3Experimental Pediatric University Children 's Hospital, Cologne, Ger- many Introduction: Intragenic deletions within the LSAMP -Gene on human chromosome 3 have been described in osteo-sarcomas and osteosarcoma cell lines before. We asked for the frequency of intragenic LSAMP copy number variations (CNVs) in primary neuroblastomas, neuroblastoma celllines and cell lines from other cancer origin. Materials and Methods: Speci c real time PCRs were established for genomic regions of the seven exons of theLSAMP -gene (NM_002338.4) and six genomic copy number of the seven LSAMP- exons was calculated according to the 2 Ctmethod, control DNAs below (deletion) or above (duplication) the 2ndstandard deviation (SD) of the mean of the controls. In total we investigated genomic DNA from n =54 primary neuroblastomas, n=12 neuroblastoma cell lines and n=17 cell We The ndings did not correlate with tumor stage, age at diagnosis or survival. Furthermore, wefound distinct CNVs of one or multiple LSAMP -exons in n =16 out of the n=29 cell lines investigated (55%).Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 527Conclusions: In primary neuroblastomas LSAMP CNVs were found only in a minority of cases. The clinical relevance for primary neuroblastoma development remains unclear. The common nding of LSAMP intragenic CNVs in cell lines of neuroblastoma and other cancer origin gives further evidence of a tumor suppressor function of LSAMPand makes us assume, that a loss of LSAMP function might be relevant for growth progression of tumor cells.

A com- parison of the molecular alterations between Non-SmallCell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Lung Carcinoid (LC) subtypes however is missing and might further improve patient strati cation. Methods: We sequenced 216 paired tumour-normal samples using a combination of whole-exome and targeted capture Additionally, all samples underwentIllumina OmniExpressExome (v1.6) SNP genotyping. Results: Out of 108 lung cancer patients, 22 had LC and 86 NSCLC. Those with NSCLCs showed lower survivaltime compared to LCs of these genes were mutated in the LC subtype. Similarly, Copy Number (CN) burden was also higher in NSCLC than in of LC patients showed MYC ampli and Furthermore, MTAP andCDKN2A were NSCLC but at 4.5% only in LCs. Conclusions: Molecular pro les in NSCLC and LC are substantially different and this may have direct conse- quences in the therapy decision process. For example, preferential loss of the CDKN2A locus in NSCLC could impact the response to immunotherapy drugs. In contrast, as MDM2 is a negative regulator of TP53 ,MDM2 ampli ca- in NSCLC could indicate of MDM2 inhibitors in p53 mutant tumours. C. Domingo-Sabugo: None. E. Starren: None. A. Mandal: None. A.

Testing for these mutations and tailoring therapy accordingly arewidely accepted as standard practice. Recently a novel technology that enables high multiplex ampli cation reac- (ddPCR TM) technology, the Atila iCARE (RUO) Lung cancer mutation screening kit identi es and quanti es 99 possible mutation sites in two reaction wells in a rapidand cost-effective manner. Materials and Methods: Articially prepared DNA samples were used to evaluate analytical sensitivity andspecicity. We used enzymatically digested normal human genomic DNA as negative DNA samples and mutation bearing plasmid DNA as spike in positive DNA. A serialdilution at 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, sensitivity. Results: The iCARE Lung cancer screening assay targets 42 mutations in EGFR, 41 mutations in KRAS, 1 mutation in BRAF, 13 mutations in HER2, and 1 mutation in MET. The assay differentiates mutations from wildtype targetsbased on cluster locations in the ddPCR TMtwo-dimensional graphs. All mutations were successfully detected in serially diluted samples containing from 8% to 0.1% spikedmutations.528 J. del PicchiaConclusions: The iCARE Mutation Screen- ing Assay kit allows quanti cation and screening for 99 NSCLC mutations of multiple samples in a rapid and cost- effective manner. The assay has reached 0.1% sensitivity for mutation detection in all 5 genes and showed no false positive in wildtype DNA samples. Z. Yang: A.

Kulkarni Guy's and St Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Introduction: The clinical bene t of a multidisciplinary clinic (MDC) model has been well documented for a variety of medical conditions. We designed and implemented anovel MDC for Lynch syndrome (LS) patients, which aims to improve treatment outcomes, participation in research trials, and patient satisfaction. Methods: From January 2019, LS patients in our region were invited to attend a bimonthly MDC offering gene- specic evidence-based cancer risk management. Patients could choose to see the gastroenterology, colorectal, gynaecology, medical oncology, research, and clinical psychology teams. Clinical outcomes and patient satisfac-tion were evaluated over 12 months. Results: Thirty-eight LS patients were seen (8 MLH1 ,1 8 ,4PMS2 ); mean female; risk-reducing gynaecological surgery, 7 (27%) under-went at our institution ( n=4) or locally ( n=3), and 13 (50%) were too young for surgery. Eight patients (30.8%) transferred their colonoscopic surveillance to ourcare due to concerns about local provision. Nineteen patients (73.1%) accessed psychological support and 10 patients (38.5%) were recruited to research studies. Twenty-six patients (68.4%) completed a post-clinic satisfaction questionnaire; 96.2% ( n=25) rated their clinic experience as excellent or very good. Conclusions: We have designed and implemented an effective multidisciplinary model of care for LS, whichaddresses unmet needs in this patient group. Other institutions are encouraged to adopt a coordinated MDC service for LS. We will continue to evaluate the MDC 's impact on disease-speci c outcomes in future reports. B. DeSouza: None. V.

At the moment, there are 76 Lynch syndrome patients in Estonia. Aim: To determine the prevalence of MMR gene mutations in Estonian general population. Material and methods: Data from Estonian Genome Center, 2420 genomes and 2356 exomes, was analyzed to calculate the of EPCAM gene two in PMS2 , three in and none MLH1 and one disease-causing andEPCAM genes and none in MSH2 and PMS2 genes. Altogether eight mutations were found and based on that the estimated prevalence of MMR gene mutations in Estonian general population is 1:597 (Poisson95% CI: 1:1384 - 1:303). In Estonian patient cohort MLH1 was the most prevalent gene mutated (34 patients) followed byMSH2 (24), MSH6 (10), PMS2 (3) and EPCAM (2) genes. From MMR genes MSH6 gene variants were detected most frequently in our general population. The prevalence of MSH6 mutations was also higher than described in the literature in our patient cohort. Conclusions: We present Estonian general population prevalence of Lynch syndrome associated MMR genevariants based on Estonian Genome Center data. According to literature, MMR gene variants prevalence in the world is 1:370-450, which compared to Estonian data is ~1.5 timeshigher. Funding: Estonian Research Council grants PRG471, PUTJD827. None.

University Hospital, Elche, Spain -Introduction: Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal- dominant cancer-predisposing syndrome caused by muta-tions in mismatch repair genes (MMR). Germline altera- tions in MMR genes shows a substantial level of cancer risk heterogeneity. Identifying genetic modi ers of risk could help to achieve a more precise cancer risk prediction and more ef cient personalized surveillance programs. We aimed to identify new potential genetic modi ers of LS penetrance using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). -Materials and Methods: Twenty-three from MMR pathogenic variants in MLH1 or MSH2 were sequenced by WES. Fifteen patients were diagnosed of LS-spectrum cancers before age 45 and 8 were healthy carrier individuals aged over 55. WES wasperformed using SureSelect-Human-AllExonV6 +UTR (AgilentTechnologies) libraries and sequencing on 100X. and variantcalling was performed by SureCall and variant ltering by a custom pipeline for cohort analyses on AlissaInterpret software (AgilentTechnologies). -Results: Among 254.316 total called variants, we only considered those present in over 80% of cancer patients and less than 20% of healthy carriers, and found 20 geneticvariants in 18 genes [RR =2.571; 95%CI: 1.05-6.15; p=0.023]. Four variants were located and 16 in UTRs or intronic sequences. Populationfrequency of all variants is over 20% (GnomAD). Intriguingly, 17 of these have been also reported as somatic mutations in tumors, 9 of them in colorectal adenocarci-noma (ICGC). -Conclusions: We identi ed 20 new variants as possible risk modi er for LS. Further studies in larger cohorts of LS patients are needed to con rm their cancer risk impact. -Grant_ID: PI17/01082(ISCIII_AES) E. D\u00e1maso: None. A. Castillejo: None. A. None. J. Medical Center, Israel,5Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Introduction: Lynch-like refers to indi- viduals with mismatch repair (MMR)-de cient tumors, with no pathogenic germline mutation identi ed MMR gene. Biallelic somatic inactivation or cryptic MMR germline mutations not detected during genetic testing have been proposed to be involved, although germline pathogenicgenetic variants in highly penetrant genes other than MMR genes could also be causing this phenotype. Material and Methods: Sixteen patients with non- polyposis LLS colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosed before the age of 40 were selected for germline and tumor whole- exome sequencing. A knockout cellular model for acandidate recessive gene was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and genetic variants were produced by mutagenesis and ectopically expressed. Subsequently, DNA damage, micro-satellite instability and mutational signatures were monitored. Results: Two potentially pathogenic recessive variants were detected in an with infertility problems. Two somatic MLH1 pathogenic genetic variants were also detected. DNA damage was evident for MCM8 KOcells and the analyzed genetic variants. Microsatellite instability and mutational signatures in MCM8KOcells were compatible with an involvement of MCM8 in MMR. Conclusions: Some LLS CRC cases may be caused by underlying germline mutations in genes different than MMR genes, especially in patients with an early onset.We suggest MCM8 as a new gene involved in germline CRC predisposition and infertility with a recessive et Acu\u00f1a- M.

Sousa Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal Aim: To implement a similar programme to the original \"Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics \"ofBRCA1/2 testing in our Hospital, extending the criteria to include prostatecancer. Methods: We de ned patient selection criteria and designed a protocol for patient referral, informed consent,sample collection, and genetic testing. We centralized the process through Genetics, making sure we had knowledge of all patients included and their results. We promotededucational sessions for oncologists, prepared informative brochures for patients, and produced standard clinical reports to accompany laboratory test results. Statisticalanalysis was done after codi cation. Results: Since September 2018, 106 patients were referred, of whom 94 were included. The most frequent inclusioncriteria was breast cancer (BC) <40 years ( n=32), followed by ovarian cancer ( n=18), and triple negative BC ( n=15). Of 86 available results, we identi ed 9 (10.5%) pathogenic variants (8 germinal/1 somatic) and 6 VUS (5 germinal/ 1 somatic). All patients in whom a variant was identi ed had a genetics appointment within a mean time of 17.9 \u00b1 15.8 days.The mean response time of genetic testing was 51.7 \u00b1 9.8 days. The mean time from patient referral to n a lr e s u l t s( s e n tt ot h e oncologist) was 67.7 \u00b1 18.8 days. Conclusions: We decreased our waiting time for urgent patients and lessened the burden of extra appointments in our clinic, while providing faster results that mightinfluence patients 'treatment. In the future we will assess impact on patients and their families, degree of satisfaction with the protocol (both from patients and oncologists), andreview the classi cation of previously identi ed None.

However, several factors can affect SMRP levels, hampering its accuracy and limiting its usage in the clinical practice. Inthe present work, we explored the hypothesis that genetic variants within the MSLN promoter could represent a con- founding factor able to affect SMRP levels. Methods: Blood samples from a cohort of 70 MPM and 689 non-MPM subjects were analyzed to assess the association between the SMRP levels and four carried out in Met-5A and Mero14 cell lines using a fluorescence reporter assay to assess the differences between the activity of the four variants of the MSLN promoter and to identify the SNPs responsible for the observed differences. Results: Carriers of haplotype #2 showed a signi cantly higher level of SMRP when compared with the reference group ( p-value < 10 5). The functional study con rmed the role of haplotype #2, which caused a 41% increase in the reporter fluorescence intensity ( p-value=6x104). The in vitro analysis also led to the identi cation of rs2235503 C>A as the SNP responsible for the increased activity of haplotype #2 (35% increase in the reporter The rare variant of rs2235503 C>A leads to an increase of SMRP levels through the enhancement of MSLN expression. The establishment of a personalized cut-off value based on this SNP could increase the accuracy of SMRP in the diagnosis of MPM. R. Silvestri: None. P. Pucci: None. C. De Santi: None. I.

Armeanu-Ebinger1, Amaral2, Germany Introduction: Melanoma is an aggressive cutaneous tumor with an increasing incidence. Sun exposure is one of the major risk factors. Recent studies indicate that 6-7 % of allmelanoma patients carry a pathogenic germline variant in a cancer predisposition gene (CPG) while the association with melanoma is often unknown. We screened a large cohort ofstage II melanoma patients for pathogenic germline variants in CPGs. Materials and Methods: DNA from paired tumor and normal FFPE tissue of 196 patients with stage II melanoma was sequenced with a NGS custom enrichment panel covering 693 genes, promotor and intronic regions.We used 152 CPGs were ltered for population allele frequency (AF < 1 %) and classi ed according to ACMG guidelines. Results: We detected pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in recessive and dominant CPGs in 18 out of (9.2 %, including ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, MSH2, PALB2, SDHA). A second hit in tumor tissue was detected in one patient carrying an ATM mutation. Tumors withgermline pathogenic variants in MSH2 did not reveal microsatellite instability. Besides relevance for surveillance and families, ve pathogenic variants affected DNA repair genes with potential relevance for therapy. Conclusions: Pathogenic germline variants in CPGs in stage II melanoma patients are frequent and of relevance forsurveillance, families and potentially therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate whether pathogenic532 J. del Picchiavariants in CPGs that are not known to be related to melanoma contribute to melanoma development. S.

Makrythanasis1,3 1Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece,2First Department of Dermatology and Venereology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, Andreas Syggros Hospital for Skin and Venereal Diseases, Athens, Greece,3Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, Medical School, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland Introduction: Cutaneous melanoma develops frequently in people over the age of 50 and can arise sporadically or in the setting of a germline predisposition in approximately10% of cases. During the last years high penetrance genes have been discovered and genes related to nevus count and pigmentation have been linked to melanoma. However only50% of the patients that demonstrate positive family history carry germline mutation in the above-mentioned genes, suggesting that other genes or an interplay of genes may beimplicated in its carcinogenesis. Additionally, the pre- valence of pathogenic variants in these genes in cases of early onset of melanoma is poorly studied. Materials and Methods: We performwhole exome sequencing of DNA extracted from blood of 80 patients with early onset melanoma (diagnosis occurring before 40 years ofage). We rst assess a panel of genes containing genes hitherto associated with familial melanoma, genodermatoses,DNA repair, telomere maintenance, pigmentation, nevus count and hereditary predisposition to other cancers and subsequently expand our analysis to the whole exome. The family history isre-examined according to results. Results: We have analyzed data from 10 patients. In 1 patient we have identi ed one novel pathogenic variant in CDKN2A . Aggregate data per gene, family of genes and pathways are catalogued and studied. Conclusions: The present study is ongoing, and we aim to de ne the prevalence of known high penetrance genes and to identify potential candidate variants/genes implicated in cases of early onset of melanoma.

P12.140.A Patients with germline pathogenic variants in DNA repair genes show increased susceptibility to asbestos-induced malignant pleural mesothelioma M. Sculco 1, M.

Arole for inherited predisposition was hypothesized since the 10- 17% of individuals exposed to high levels of asbestos develop MPM and some families present multiple MPM cases. Materials and Methods: We investigated 107 cancer- predisposing genes in 144 MPM patients (16 familiar,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 533128 sporadic) by NGS. Lifelong asbestos exposure was quanti ed in 131 patients. Moreover, we performed WES in two families, each with three MPM cases. Results: We identi (evaluated as pathogenic by 6 in silico prediction tools), mostly in genes involved in homologous recombination repair that repairsdouble strand breaks in DNA caused by asbestos. PTVs carriers represent 11% of the patients and show a statistically signi cant lower asbestos exposure in compar- ison to non-mutated patients ( p=0.0003). Only one of the six patients analyzed by WES, showed a PTV in PMS2 ,a gene involved in mismatch repair, suggesting that asbestosexposure may have a predominant role in some families. Conclusions: Overall, these data suggest that patients with germline variants in DNA repair genes are lessprocient to repair the DNA damage induced by asbestos and show increased susceptibility to asbestos-induced MPM. These patients carrying predisposing variants mayrespond to drugs that induce synthetic lethality.

Many studies haveshown that development of malignancies is mainly driven by alterations of cellular signaling pathways. MicroRNAs are small noncoding molecules playing an essential role invarious biological processes. The aim of this study was to534 J. del Picchiaevaluate the functional role of miR-20b and miR-451a and their target genes in GC. Materials and methods: To determine the expression level of miR-20b and miR-451a in vivo and in vitro, biopsy samples of GC patients, healthy controls, INS-GAS mice, AGS and MKN28 cell lines samples were analysed usingqRT-PCR. To con rm putative microRNA target-genes and determine miR-20b and miR-451a impact on cell function, luciferase reporter, protein expression, MTT, clonogenic,apoptosis, wound healing assays were performed in GC cell cultures. Results: Deregulated expression of miR-20b and miR- 451a was determined in GC cell lines and the INS-GAS mouse model. Western blot and luciferase reporter assay have also con rmed that miR-20b directly regulates expression of PTEN and upregulation of miR-451a expression exhibits an anti-tumor effect in vitro (miR- 20b: reduced viability, colony formation, increased apop- tosis rate, and miR-451a: reduced colony forming ability). Conclusions: This study identi ed that expression of miR-20b and miR-451a are deregulated in vitro and in vivo and have a tumor suppressive role in GC through regulationof the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Jablonowski2 1Medical University of Lodz Department of Clinical Genetics, Lodz, Poland,2Medical University of Lodz I Clinic of Urology, Lodz, Poland Introduction: Bladder cancer (BC) is still characterized by a very high death rate in patients with this disease. One ofthe reasons for this is the lack of adequate markers which could help determine the biological potential of the tumor to develop into its invasive stage. Some microRNAs (miR-NAs) correlate with disease progression. The purpose of this study was to identify which miRNAs can accurately predict the presence of BC and can differentiate low grade(LG) tumors from high grade (HG) tumors.Materials and methods: The study included 55 patients with diagnosed bladder cancer and 30 persons belonging to the control group. The expression of seven selected miRNAs was estimated with the real-time PCR technique according to miR-103-5p (for the normalization of the results). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curvesand the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the feasibility of using selected markers as biomarkers for detecting BC and discriminating non-muscle invasive BC(NMIBC) from muscle invasive BC (MIBC). Results: For HG tumors, the relevant classi ers are miR- 205-5p and miR-20a-5p, whereas =0.964 and AUC =0.992, respectively). NMIBC patients with characterized by signi cantly higher miR-130b-3p expres- sion values compared to patients in HG tumors. Conclusions: Ourndings could be of clinical impor- tance. The implementation of miR-205-5p, miR-20a-5p andmiR-130b-3p into routine practice can be an alternative to screening or the follow up of treatment effects.

Whitworth , J. Martin, O. Giger, F. Nice, G. Clark, M. Maranian, F. Rodger, NIHR BioResource Rare Diseases Consortium, E. Maher University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom Tumours are often conceptualised as occurring due to germline variants in cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) or solely somatic mutations but mosaicism for a CPG variant has also been widely described. Mosaic individuals are atincreased risk of neoplasms and are not readily detected clinically. Multiple primary tumours in the same individual (MPT) represent an opportunity to detect mosaicism asvariants may be present in both tumours but not blood. We sequenced separate primaries from three MPT individuals with a panel assay incorporating 350 cancer genes on DNAfrom FFPE tissue, and corresponding blood samples with whole-genome sequencing. Variants in tumour samples were ltered or splice variants present in both tumours from each individual and exclude likely false positives. 2/3 individuals had truncating CPGAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 535variants in both of their tumours that were undetected in their blood sample or in other tumours in the same sequencing run ( n=23). One had a VHL frameshift variant detected in bilateral clear cell renal cell carcinomas diag- nosed at age 40 and 47 years. Variant allele fractions (VAF) were 41% and 49% respectively and 0/37 germline readsshowed evidence of the variant. Another case had a TP53 nonsense variant in bilateral breast carcinomas diagnosed at age 48 and 52 years. VAFs were 22% and 15% and 0/34germline reads showed variant base calls. Neither individual had a family history of tumours in rst degree relatives. These results suggest appreciable frequency of CPGpathogenic variant mosaicism in MPT cases without a prominent family history cancer. J. Whitworth: None. J. Martin: None. O. Giger: None. F.

The main factors implicated in MPN development are genetic factors (hereditary predisposition to cancer); hormonal factors; lifestyle (smoking, alcohol con-sumption), unhealthy diet and obesity; environmental factors etc. The aim of the current study was to explore the role of genetic predisposition for MPN development. Materials and Methods: The study included 36 MPN patients, selected according to recognized IACR/IARCguidelines, of which 20 females (56%) and 16 males (44%). Fifty ve % of the patients had family history of cancer and 30.5% had an early onset (<50y). The analysis of germline mutations was performed by NGS of a panel of 94 tumor- associated genes on a MiSeq platform (Illumina). Results: Around 18% of the total variants were evaluated as clinically signi cant. Among selected variants 33.4% were pathogenic, 13.3% signi cance (VUSs). Pathogenic/ likely detected genetic cause of MPN was found in 42.7% of the patients. Further research is needed to evaluate the functional effect of all VUSs. Thus clinicalmulti-gene panel testing is recommended for detection of germline mutations in high-risk MPN individuals.

However, theidenti cation of a genetic cause in individuals with multiple primary malignancies is still challenging due to phenotypic536 J. del Picchiavariability, presence of phenocopies and mostly used can- didate gene approaches. To unravel the presence of an inherited cancer predisposition, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on germline DNA from 44 individuals selected for the presence of either: i) 2 primary tumors <65 years; ii) one tumor and one additional feature (e.g. mac-rocephaly, benign tumors) <65; or, iii) an adult type of cancer <25. We analyzed sequencing data for germline variants in 211 known cancer predisposition genes (CPGs)and classi ed each variant based on the AMCG/AMP guidelines. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in CPGs were identi ed in 10/44 individuals (23%). Two individuals carried one pathogenic variant that explains their tumor phenotype ( PTEN ;NF1). (n=1) have contributed to their malignancies were identi ed. In three individuals, the analysis revealed heterozygous pathogenicvariants in genes associated with recessive disorders (POLH ,n=2;RAD50 ,n=1). In our highly selected cohort of adults with multiple primary tumors we identi ed pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in CPGs in 23% of patients. This analysis resulted in a molecular diagnosis for two individuals and for eight individuals we identi ed alterations that may have cooperated in cancer develop- ment, giving cues for further genome-wide analysis on the germline and tumor tissues that are now ongoing.

The aim of the study was to identify the mutational features associated with high risk of secondary CNS involvement in DLBCL. Methods: Diagnostic FFPE tissue blocks of patients with DLBCL, subsequently developed a CNS relapse, weretaken. Whole exome sequencing of 7 tumor samples was performed. Additionally DLB L whole-exome sequencing of dates presented in the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics were analyzed: cases proven CNS relapse were selected. Results: In the tumor tissue of patients with DLBCL the MYD88 p.L265P recurrent mutation was detected in 3/7 of samples. According to the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics database, in DLBCL patients with CNS relapses mutations in theMYD88 gene were detected in 14/48, 29.2% of cases. In the sample of patients without secondary CNS lesions, the central nervous system mutations in the MYD88 and only 36/359 (10.0%) without this mutation (p < 0.001). The CNS relapse risk in mutation 95% CI (1.59; It is shown that testing DLBCL for MYD88 mutations is a potentially approach to diagnosingpatients with high CNS relapse risk. E. Voropaeva: None. T.

Classical MPNs have been classi ed into 3 V617F mutation is detected in nearly 90% of PV patients, and in around a half of all ET and MF patients The aim of thisAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 537study was to verify the effectiveness of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) in the diagnosis of JAK2 V617F-mutated MPN and to investigate how the mutated allele burden correlate with the clinic. Materials and methods: the JAK2 V617F mutation have been evaluated/quanti ed by ddPCR in 21 patients with MPN of whom 15 had the mutation. Results: an increase of mutant allele burden from ET to PV and PMF was observed. A moderate negative correla-tion between the mutation burden and the platelet counts was found. A correlation between splenomegaly and the mutation burden was also observed. In conclusion, ourstudy showed that quanti cation of the JAK2 V617F mutational burden by ddPCR could represent a new and promising technology for detection of JAK2 mutation inMPNs and the follow up of the patients may re flect the clinical response to treatment.

P12.156.B Three novel splicing mutations in the NF1 gene cause exon skipping I. Kyprianou 1, Centre, Nicosia, Cyprus Introduction: Neuro bromatosis type 1 is a condition characterized by changes in skin coloring (caf\u00e9-au-laitspots) and the growth of tumors (neuro bromas) along nerves in the skin, brain, and other parts of the body. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary widely amongaffected people. Case Description: Three patients with clinical diagnosis of Neuro bromatosis type 1 were investigated for molecular evidence to support. Methodology: A custom Haloplex/ Sureselect (Agilent) NGS panel was used to investigate mutations in Neuro - bromatosis associated genes as per manufacturer 's instruc- tions. RNA investigation for exon skipping was employed.Interpretation: Three heterozygous novel splice-site mutations in c.1642- 2A>G, c.1722-1G>A, c.6085-3C>A variants are all classi- ed as pathogenic according to ACMG recommendations and Bioinformatics tools predicted that this novel mutations have pathogenic effects on splicing machinery. RNAinvestigation revealed that these variants lead in exon 15, exon 16, and exon 41 skipping of the NF1 gene, respectively. Conclusions: To date, more than 1,000 NF1 mutations that cause neuro bromatosis type 1 have been identi ed. Most of these mutations are unique within families. ManyNF1 mutations result in the production of an extremely short or abnormal version of the protein neuro bromin. This study highlights the presence of three novel splicingmutations in the NF1 gene that lead in exon skipping, causing the production of aberrant protein isoforms. I. Kyprianou: None. V.

P12.158.A Splicing variants in hereditary cancer genes: clinical utility of functional RNA analysis K. Agiannitopoulos 1, G. Pepe1, E. Greece,4Theagenio Anticancer Thessaloniki, Greece,5IASO Hospital, General Medicine Turkey,11Tansan Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey,12American variants remains a challenge. Most splicing variants (SVs) in genes associated with hereditary cancer are often classi ed as variants of uncertain signi cance (VUS) due to the lack of functional RNA analysis. The aim of this study538 J. del Picchiawas to investigate the occurrence of SVs in hereditary cancer genes the clinical utility of RNA analysis. Material and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 887 individuals referred to our laboratory for genetic testing using a NGS panel of 36 hereditary cancer genes. Functional RNA analysis for SVs was performedwith RNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes following RT-PCR and Sanger Sequencing. Results: A SV (2.5%) and (31.8%) were classi ed as pathogenic and 5/22 (22.7%) as likely pathogenic. The remaining 10 variants were initially classi ed as VUS (45.5%) and RNA analysis could be performed for 2 variants. RNA analysis of a variant in ATM (c.2125-1G>T) revealed the deletion of 11 bases (r.2125del), thus resulting in a frameshift (p.(Ile709Phefs*22)). Moreover, for a MSH2 variant (c.1510 +1_1510 +2dupGT), it was shown that the insertion of 2 bases (r.1510dup) causes a frameshift, p.(Gly5040-Glyfs*39). The two novel variants were reclassi ed from VUS to Pathogenic. Conclusions: In our cohort, SVs accounted for 8.6% of pathogenic and 2.5% of VUS results. RNA analysis assisted in the reclassi cation of 20.0% of splicing VUS. RNA analysis is essential in the case of uncharacterized SVs, forproper classi cation and personalized management of Agiannitopoulos: None. G. Pepe: None. E. Papa- dopoulou: None. G. Tsaousis: None.

P12.160.C Evaluating the performance of the NF2 Genetic Severity Score and the potential impact of using functional assaysto improve prognosis prediction in a cohort of Spanish patients N. Catasus 1, B. Garcia2, A. Plana3, A.

A genotype-phenotype asso- ciation is well established in NF2. A Genetic Severity Score(GSS) for NF2 mutations was developed to help predicting the disease course 2. In the present study, we evaluated the performance of the GSS in our Spanish NF2 cohort andanalyzed the potential added value of including functional molecular information. Methods: Patients: GSS was validated using the NF2 Spanish Reference Center HUGTiP-ICO cohort. Functional assays: Merlin, ERK and their phosphorylated forms weremeasured by Western Blot using patient-derived broblasts. Association analysis: Mann-Whitney U test and regression model analysis. Results: The application of the GSS to the Spanish NF2 cohort con rmed the identi of 's and NF2 mutation: Spanish patients that harbor a truncating mutation in the NF2 gene were associated with a most severe disease. However, for mutations in mosaicism and mutations associated to moderate phenotypes, GSS did not predict their clinicaloutcome as expected. We identi ed a correlation between the phenotype and the degree of activation of ERK pathway. We developed a lineal regression model to predictNF2 prognosis from functional and molecular data. Conclusions: We validated the GSS in our cohort although a signi cant phenotypic variability intragroup was identi ed. To improve the performance of GSS, we evaluated the additional use of functional assays that allowed a better classi cation patients with mild and moderated phenotypes by applying a new statistical model.

Roggia1,M. Schadeck2,1, U. Faust1, auto- somal dominant disorder characterized by multiple schwannomas and mostly bilateral vestibular schwannoma(VS). Mutation carriers may develop meningiomas, epen- dymomas and retinal hamartomas. Mosaicism is a known phenomenon which is dif cult to detect by conventional sequencing and is therefore impeding cascade screening and adequate surveillance for offspring-carriers. We describe a 27-year-old woman reaching out for preconception advicewhile presenting with singular VS, a facial nerve schwan- noma, multiple cerebral bilateral meningiomas and medullar schwannomas, rst diagnosed at the age of 26 years. Her parents or other family members were not affected, sug- gesting a de novo mutation in the NF2-gene. Previously external performed Sanger sequencing did not detect anypathogenic mutation in NF2 in the patient\u00b4s blood. We analyzed two different tumors of the patient (facial nerve schwannoma and medullar schwannoma) by next-generation genic clonal NF2 variant (c. 362dup:p.Val122Glyfs*8) together with a second hit (LOH) in both tumors. The samepathogenic frameshift NF2-Variant was subsequently con- rmed by NGS in blood and in skin (with an allele fre- quency of 0.5 % and 1 %, respectively), while no mutationwas detected in genes associated with schwannomatosis (LZTR1, SMARCB1 and PRKAR1A ), ruling out the main diagnosis of NF2. Deep sequencing of bloodthrough modern sequencing techniques such as NGS can improve the sensitivity of detection of mosaicism compared to traditional sequencing allowing therefore adequategenetic counseling concerning the risk for offsprings to inherit NF2 and speci c surveillance for children carrying the mutation.

Mecucci University of Perugia, A growing number of hereditary hematological malig- nancies have been reported since the extended use of NGS that greatly improved our knowledge on germline mutationsunderlying myeloid neoplasms. We developed a customized diagnostic NGS panel (CHHD_A_v1 NGS panel, SOPHiA Genetics) including 21 established leukemia predisposingand 35 telomere biology Cases (cytopenia(s), syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia) were on personal and/orfamilial history. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Fastq les were analyzed with SOPHiA DDM software. Coding variants with variant fractionbetween 40 and 60 or >90, and minor allele frequency in ExAC, esp5400) were classi ed according to the ACMG guidelines. From 46 diagnostic samples 209 rare variants emerged; 47 were non-coding, 160 coding (84 3 inframe indel, 3 nonsense, 2 involved TERC gene; 78/160 were benign/likely benign, 73 VUS, 3 likely pathogenic and 6 pathogenic. In this group two novel variants affectedRAD50 gene. Undescribed, likely pathogenetic variant affected CEBPA in one familial leukemia and RUNX1 in one post-transplant donor leukemia. A novel TERC VUS g.303G>A was associated with frank telomere pathology. Moreover, the DDX41 was found in 3/46 cases (6.5%) of this highly selected series, suggesting it plays a role in MDS/AML. Sharing of NGS results will deeply improveour knowledge on the occurrence and role of rare variants at candidate genes in hematological phenotypes. C. Matteucci: None. F. Pellanera: None. V.

Ongen, N. M. R. Lykoskou s, C. Borel, G. Puga Yung, J. D. Seebach, E. T. Dermitzakis University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland Most cancers are associated with coding mutations. How- ever, the effects of non-coding regulatory drivers in cancer development remains poorly understood. In a previousstudy (BioRxiv 174219), we identi ed 32 local modules of coordinated non-coding regulatory elements (CRDs, FDR 5%) that accumulated an excess of somatic mutations in 150patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We hypothesized that CRDs with excess of somatic mutations (after controlling for mutational confounders) can have adriver role in CLL development. We aimed to functionally characterize the effect of signi cant CRDs on their candi- date target genes. We developed an in vitro model in which 317 genetically- different lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are evaluated for variations in cancer-like phenotypes such as cell migration(chemotaxis), proliferation (mitotic index) and apoptosis (Fas-induced). In a preliminary screening on 42 LCLs, we found 50 signi cant genome-wide SNPs associated phenotypes we identi ed a SNP correlating with proliferation (p < =4.762e07) that is an eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) associated withthe GSDMB (gasdermin B) gene (P < =0.0001), which has been linked with apoptosis and cancer regulation. We are currently in the process to investigate the expression pro le of all 317 LCLs. These data together with phenotypic data will allow us to functionally characterize LCLs with differential expression of candidatedriver genes. This could provide an experimental frame- work to explore and dissect the contribution of the non- coding cancer genome in CLL, helping to understand thebiological complexity of these effects. Experiments are ongoing and updated results will be presented. A. R\u00e9al: None. H. Ongen: None. N.M.R. Lykoskou Cancer Center of Lesnoy, Minsk District, Belarus Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) comprises approximately 75-85% of primary bladder cancer cases, haslow mortality rate, but is burdened by high rates of recur- rence and progression. The risk of the latter is de ned by the complex of clinicopathologic features which, however,provide low accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes. The aim of our study was to determine the prognostic value of CDKN2A andRB1 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with regard to pro- gression in a prospective cohort of 249 NMIBC patients.The multivariate Cox regression analysis, after adjusting for clinical parameters, revealed an independent effect of pre- vious recurrence episodes (HR 25.1; 3.7-114.5; =0.001) on NMIBC progression. Simultaneous presence of at least 3 established predictors resulted in signi cantly decreased 5- year progression-free survival (14.3 \u00b1 13.2%) as compared with a lesser number of indicated molecular alterations (91.9 \u00b1 2.8%) (p < 0.001, log-rank test). Using logisticregression, we built a prediction model, comprising all ve prognostic factors. The 5-marker panel was able to dis- criminate between patients with and without city, and 0.88 AUC ( < 0.001). The data obtained demonstrate that the use of molecular markers in addition to clinicopathologic onesmay help in stratifying NMIBC patients into groups with different prognosis for the selection of optimal treatment regimens.

P in liquid biopsy from Lithuanian non- small cell lung cancer Biosciences, Life Sciences Center, Vilniu University, Vilnius, Lithuania Introduction & Objectives: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common and rapidly progressing cancer with poor survival rates. Blood cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has beenproven to have prognostic potential as well as being useful for molecular pro ling and monitoring disease burden. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is the most ef cient and sensitive method to detect mutations from cfDNA. The aim of this study was to screen Lithuanian NSCLC samples for common lung cancer-related mutations by targeted NGSand to determine their associations with clinical features. Materials & Methods: Analysis was conducted in NSCLC patient plasma samples before treatment and afterclinical progression. Sequencing libraries were prepared from cfDNA using Oncomine Lung panel targeting 11 gene 180 hotspot mutation regions. Results: Out of all 39 analysed plasma samples, in 24 samples taken before treatment largely from patients with advanced NSCLC, we identi ed 34 protein-coding mutations. Of them - 2 mutations were INDELS. Most common pathogenic variants in Lithuanian population were KRAS and PIK3CA . Moreover, higher mutation load was detected in patient samples after clinical progression vs samples before treatment. Speci cally, in a group of542 J. del Picchiapatient 's overall mutation count was found 4-fold higher in samples after immediate progression diagnosed during routine check-up at end of the treatment as compared to patient samples before treatment. In conclusion , plasma cfDNA is useful for molecular pro ling of NSCLC patients to capture clinically relevant somatic alterations in advancedstage patients and could be used as prognostic biomarker.

Half of the biallelic carriers alsodisplay multiple colonic or extra-colonic primary tumors, mainly breast, endometrium, urothelium and brain tumors. Published data designates NTHL1 as an important con- tributor to hereditary cancers but also underlines the scarcity of available information. Thanks to the French oncogenetic consortium (Groupe G\u00e9n\u00e9tique et Cancer), a well-organizednetwork of laboratories and family cancer clinics, we col- lected NTHL1 variants from 6432 patients attending a visit for hereditary colon cancer ( n=3529) or other hereditary cancers ( n=2903). We found 7 patients with pathogenic, loss of function, biallelic NTHL1 germline variations. All carriers were from the \"colorectal cancer or polyposis \" collection and no variant was identi ed in the \"extra digestive \"collection of patients. Among the 7 biallelic carriers, 6 underwent colonoscopy and all of them presentedadenomatous polyps. For digestive cancers, average age at diagnosis was 59 and we reported colorectal, duodenal, caecal and pancreatic cancer. None of these tumors showedmicrosatellite instability. Extra-digestive malignancies included sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, scalp melanoma. We reported thesecond largest NTHL1 collection. NTHL1 is not yet con- sidered for diagnostic purposes in France. Despite tumor risks to be precisely de ned, these novel data may favor NTHL1 inclusion in diagnostic panel testing. Colonic sur- veillance should be based on MUTYH recommendations and extra-colonic surveillance has to be de ned. F. Boulouard: None. E. Kasper: None. M. Buisine: None. G. Lienard: None. S.

A comprehensive assessment of BRCA defects wasperformed in 30 clinically characterized OC patients to obtain a picture of BRCA alterations and to test the accuracy of standard diagnostic approaches. BRCA1/2 sequence, copynumber, and promoter methylation were analyzed in fresh- frozen OC tissue. Twelve patients (40%) showed clear evi- of de cit (20%) pathogenic variants (3 in in BRCA2) and (3.3%) somatic BRCA2 all displaying Heterozygosity; had one BRCA1 copy deleted andthe other methylated; in the remaining 18 cases, BRCA de cit was undetected/unclear (BU). 29 patients received platinum- based chemotherapy, with baseline clinical features not sig-nicantly differing by BRCA status: after a median follow-up of 44.2 months, 15 had experienced progression: mean PFS was 43.5 months (95%CI: 35.6-51.3) in the sequence analysis in respective Formalin-Fixed- Parafn-Embedded (FPPE) samples detected all the variants found in fresh-frozen tissue, but also multiple additional somatic variants, including pathogenic variants (allelic load 20-40%) in 2 tumours previously classi ed Our ndings suggest that BRCA sequencing in FFPE OC tissue may involve a risk of false positive results, while missing a substantial fraction of BRCA defective (methylated) tumours.Supported by LOTO R.

D. analysis of uterine lavage fluid from Lithua- nian ovarian cancer patients R. Life Sciences Center, Vilniu University,Vilnius, Lithuania Introduction & Objectives: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a leading cause of death in gynecological cancers with more than 250 000 new cases diagnosed each year, 60% of these at an advanced stage. OC has only 29% 5-year survival,causing high mortality rates. However, currently there is no effective screening methodology or accurate early diag- nostic test for OC. A few proof-of-principle studiesdemonstrated the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA of uterine lavage, to identify mutations in patients with known gynecologic cancers. The aim of this study was to screen uterine lavage and ovarian tissue samples form Lithuanian OC patients for common cancer-related muta- tions by targeted NGS and to determine their associationswith clinical features. Materials & Methods: Cell-free DNA from 36 uterine lavage fluid and DNA from 18 ovarian tissue samples were analysed using NGS. The sequencing libraries were prepared using Ion AmpliSeq On-Demand Panel target- ing 10 most common OC related genes. Results: DNA mutations were detected in: 13 of 36 (36%) uterine lavage samples (21 of 36 mutations known as pathogenic) and 10 of 18 (55.56%) tissue samples (18 of 30mutations known to be pathogenic). 19 mutations (11 pathogenic) were detected in both cell-free and tissue samples from the same patients in 11 of 17 (64.71%)sample pairs. The most often mutated genes were TP53, BRAC1 and ARID1A .In conclusion , cell-free DNA samples obtained from uterine lavage could be useful formolecular pro ling of OC patients. R.

Gehrig Department of Human Genetics, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is an either inherited or acquired rare type of abdominal cancer. Smoking, alcohol consumption as well as diet and obesity are well known risk factors of this acquired disease. Germline mutations inBRCA2 are the most common cause of familial pancreatic cancer. In addition, the prevalence of ATM mutations has been found to be signi cantly higher in familial pancreatic cancer cases than in controls. Here we present data that mutations in the ATM gene may be a frequent cause of apparently sporadic pancreatic cancer. Materials and Methods: We analyzed pedigree informa- tion and genes CHEK2, NBN and PALB2) in 8families. Results: Three families showed a pathogenic mutation in BRCA2, four families had pathogenic mutations in ATM.The index patients were all men and diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma at the age < 60 years. One patient had no further family member with a history of cancer. Thefather of one index patient was diagnosed with tongue cancer. Two families showed several family members suffering from cancer like breast cancer, sarcoma, colorectalcancer and brain tumours. No mutation was detected in one patient. Conclusions: None of these presented pedigrees ful lled the criteria of any hereditary tumor syndrome. Nevertheless, pathogenic germline mutations in the ATM gene were detected in half of patients leading to the possibility ofpredictive testing in healthy family members. Therefore, genetic testing including ATM should be offered to patients with pancreatic carcinoma despite a negative family historyof cancer. E. Kunstmann: None. S. Rost: None. A.

Due to their largely unknown etiologyand molecular pathology, no effective therapeutic recom- mendations exist, especially in metastatic EPC. Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) in normal and metastatic tissue of case, supplemented by RNA-Sequencing, The metastatic EPC tissue exhibits a high somatic point mutation burden of 21 tumor-speci c alterations per MB. The dominance of C>T transitionsand double-substitutions point towards the UV-light exposure related tumor mutation signatures (Cosmic-Ver- sion3) 7a/7b. Known cancer driver mutations are present inAPC,PTEN andTP53 . In addition, multiple gene families related to cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and connectivity are notably enriched among genes harbouringmissense or truncating mutations or exhibiting dysregulated gene expression, for example PI3K subunits and protein kinases. In addition, wide-spread copy-number the genome, altered region on chr11q contains a highly expressedCTNND1:PAK1 in-frame fusion gene that likely retains Wnt-signalling as well as p21-binding and protein kinase properties. Presence of the altered region in an earlymetastasis suggests this fusion as a potentially dominant driver in tumor development.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 545Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the involvement of multiple cellular signalling pathways in EPC tumor development, many of which are involved in other cancer types, and point towards potential treatment targets.

Meijers- Heijboer1, A. Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, 3Skin Research Institute of Singapore, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore Introduction: Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 syndrome (BHD) is char- acterized pneumothorax and (RCC), and is caused by hetero- zygous germline mutations in FLCN gene. Fibrofolli- culomas are considered pathognomonic for BHD. We here present a family of which the proband has a histologically conrmed brofolliculoma, more extensive skin lesions not completely consistent with BHD and over 50 lipomas. He has no identi able lung cysts on chest CT. At least 15 family members were reported to be affected by multiplelipomas, skin lesions and/or RCC. No mutation was detected in FLCN . Materials and Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and segregation analysis in four affected family members. Results: The Cys677Tyr missense variant in PRDM10 was the only potentially causative variant present in the DNA of all four affected relatives. We hypothesized a gain- of- function effect based on limited data of PRDM10 knockout mice and the absence of LOH of PRDM10 in both lipoma and RCC tissues derived from the family. To assess the effect of the variant, we overexpressed PRDM10 wild- type and mutant protein in Renal Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells (RPTEC). Preliminary data show that overexpression PRDM10 in RPTEC results in decreasedexpression of Conclusions: We identi ed a PRDM10 variant as the most likely cause in a family with multiple lipomas, RCC and skin lesions partly resembling BHD.

Genetics General Clinic of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece,3Laboratory of Oncology, University ofThessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is one of the top leading causes of cancer-related deaths with more than 432,000 patients were predicted to die worldwide from the disease in 2018 according to the World Health Organisation. Mostpatients have a one-year survival rate of 20% and a ve- year survival rate of 7%. These low survival rates are mainly because in most cases at the time of diagnosismalignancy has already progressed to advanced stages. It is estimated that Identi cation of high-risk individuals via genetic screening can improve survival rates. Materials and methods: This multicentre retrospective study enrolled 572 patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Germline DNA was extractedfrom these patients and subjected to targeted in solution hybridisation-based next generation sequencing using the PreSENTIA pan-cancer panel covering 62 genes associatedwith cancer predisposition. Results were validated by an orthogonal method. Clinical and family history data were collected from the participants. Results: We have identi ed pathogenic variants in 18 genes associated with hereditary cancer predisposition including genes that were previously associated withincreased risk for pancreatic cancer including PALB2, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and APC. have additionally ed pathogenic variants in genes not546 J. del Picchiapreviously associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma such as SDHB, FANCM and RET. Conclusions: The results suggest that a substantial proportion of patients with PDAC are carriers of pathogenic germline variants in predisposition genes and highlight the clinical utility of germline multigene testing. Importantlyrelatives of patients that are carriers of pathogenic variants could bene t from germline testing. A. Eliades: A.

De Simone1, 2Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS, Rozzano - Milan, Italy Introduction: The analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) represents a promising strategy for non-invasive cancer diagnosis. However, the fraction of cancer-derivedccfDNA (ctDNA) is variable, and particularly low in pri- mary disease in capsulated organs like prostate. Most stu- dies explored ctDNA in advanced metastatic prostate cancer(PCa), conversely, detection of ctDNA in localized disease is challenging. In flammation, exercise, or tissue injury, substantially increase ccfDNA; we therefore hypothesizedthat prostate biopsies (each typically picking 14-18 samplesfrom the gland) might release prostate-derived ccfDNA/ ctDNA, which could be exploited for molecular tests. Materials and Methods: We collected tissue/blood samples (before and after biopsy at different timepoints) from 34 patients undergoing prostate biopsy: 26 with PCa, 8 negative. ccfDNA was extracted with the Maxwell-RSCccfDNA Plasma Kit, quanti ed by Qubit; size-distribution analysis was performed by Tape-station. Somatic mutations, identi ed by RNAseq on biopsies using the TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel, were searched in ccfDNA (before/after biopsy) by targeted NGS (NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep; mean depth 280,000x). Results: We demonstrated a signi cant increase in after biopsy extracted after biopsy were also signicantly longer. Finally, targeted NGS on pre/post- biopsy ccfDNA con rmed a signi cant enrichment in the ctDNA fraction. Conclusions: Plasma post-biopsy ccfDNA represents a source of pan-prostate DNA, a major advantage over the analysis of single biopsies. This opens the possibility to analyze somatic mutations/epigenetics markers with prog-nostic value in primary PCa. M. Corbetta: None. M. Lazzeri: None. C. Chiereghin: None. I. De Simone: None. M.

This study aimed to detectAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 547the presence of androgen receptor (AR) and the androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) a biomarker associated with worse prognosis, in blood samples of prostate cancer (PCa) patients by two methods: RT-qPCR from platelet-isolated RNA and determination of AR and AR-V7 protein levels in plasma using capillary nano-immunoassay. Methods: The study included 35 patients with PCa and 16 healthy donors. Whole blood (10mL) was collected and platelets were isolated from the supernatant by centrifuga-tion at room temperature for 20 minutes at 1500 rpm. RNA was extracted and RT-qPCR for GAPDH, ITGA2B, AR and AR-V7 was performed. Proteins were extracted todetect AR and AR-V7 using Simple West Protein analysis. Results: Both AR and AR-V7 expression were detected by RT-qPCR. Five patients exhibited a high expression ofthe 2 receptors, 8 showed low levels and 22 patients showed expression levels similar to those of the VCAP PCa cell line, that was used as a positive control. These biomarkerswere absent in the 16 healthy donors, as expected. AR protein was detected by Simple West in all plasma patients. However, AR-V7 protein was only detected in 11 patients. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that platelets contain tumor-associated RNA and could be used for detection of AR and AR-V7 expression in blood samples inPCa patients. Moreover, determination of AR-V7 protein by nano-immunoassay represents a novel methodology and may serve to detect this biomarker associated with badprognosis. P. V\u00e1zquez-C\u00e1rdenas: J.J. R.

Institute of Ljubljana, Diagnostics, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Metastatic prostate cancer (PC) has recently been introduced as an independent criterion for germlineBRCA1/2 genetic testing. Clinical studies indicate that variants in other DNA-repair genes might also have ther- apeutic (PV/LPVs) inBRCA1/2 and other DNA-repair genes in the Slovenian population of PC patients is unknown. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all PC patients referred to our institution for germline genetic testing since 2015. In 2018, we implemented genetic testing for systemic therapy decision making in metastatic PCpatients. The majority (53/57) were tested using a multi- gene panel. In four cases Sanger sequencing was performed for known familial variants. Results: Overall, we identi ed 40 patients with metastatic and 17 patients with localized PC. We detected a signi cant increase in referral rates with 8 patients (14.0%) referredbetween 2015 and 2017, 11 (19.3%) in 2018 and 38 (66.7%) in 2019. PV/LPVs in 4 different DNA-repair genes were found in 17.5% (7/40) of metastatic PC RAD51C , one in ATM ). Two (11.8%) patients with localized PC had PV/LPVs in two DNA-repair genes (one in BRCA1 , one in MSH2 ). Conclusions: Our preliminary results show a high prevalence of germline PV/LPVs in DNA-repair genes in Slovenian metastatic PC patients. Although not all detectedvariants are in known prostate-susceptibility genes, they might prove important in the future as new targeted therapy options become available, as well as for identifying otherfamily members at risk.

Henke Universit\u00e4tsklinikum M\u00fcnster, M\u00fcnster, report on a family with clustering of premenopausal breast cancer and other tumors. The rst woman appearing in our outpatient clinic was diagnosed with breast cancer(bilateral DCIS) at the age of 26. Five more family members displaying breast cancer were identi ed (age spectrum 27 to 75 years at diagnosis). Criteria for hereditary breast andovarian cancer were therefore ful lled. A complete record of family history revealed several other diseases (clear cell renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, bilateral thyroid cancer,mucoepidermoid carcinoma of trachea, ovarian cancer, endometrium glandula parotis, gastrointestinal polyps (including polypoidlesion of pancreas, benign thyroid lesions and vascular malformations). Therefore, we included PTEN in the548 J. del Picchiagenetic testing in addition to the core genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, deleterious variant (c.1003C>T, p.(Arg335*)) in PTEN which could also be found in three other family members. Molecular analysis infour further individuals is pending. Germline mutations in thePTEN tumor suppressor gene cause PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) which is characterised by frequentoccurrence of benign and malign lesions, especially an elevated lifetime risk for developing breast and thyroid cancer. This case underlines the variability of phenotypesassociated with PHTS even within one family. It highlights the importance of a detailed family history and stresses the necessity of profound knowledge about rare tumor predis-position syndromes in breast cancer families. C. Henke: None. F.

Vos Radboud university Medical Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS) have 80-100% risk to develop cancer, often in multiple organs and at early age. The majority (80%) of PHTS patients is not yet identi ed as such and does not receive proper cancer risk management. We aim for easy-to-apply criteria - usable for almost every health- care professional - to identify those at high risk of carrying aPTEN mutation in a phase prior to cancer development. Methods: In a cohort of 176 paediatric and adult PHTS patients phenotypical characteristics were assessed by oneof two expert clinicians. Prevalence of early-onset char- acteristics and their (combined) sensitivity to identify PHTS was determined for all patients and by age group (0-12, 12-25, 25+years) Results: Macrocephaly is an early-onset characteristic that was present in 82% of all patients and in 100% of thosebelow age 12 ( n=58). Multinodular Struma (MNS) development was detected in 97% of patients age 25 +. Multiple oral features (gingival hypertrophy, tongue and/ormucosal papillomas, or high palate) were detected in 94% of patients above age 25. Simpli ed criteria were formulated as the presence of two out of three of the following features: macrocephaly; MNS;and multiple oral features. In adult patients this has a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 90-98%). the oral phenotype, could serve as an early trigger initiating the more elaborate assessment of patients suspected of a PTEN mutation. They can be assessed by most clinical specialiststhat see complex patients unknowingly presenting with PHTS. N. Hoogerbrugge: None. J. Meek: None. J. Schieving: None. J.

The incidence ofthese second malignancies (SPMs) is signi cantly higher after external beam radiotherapy. We have tested if the incidence of SPM with and without previous irradiation isdistinct depending on the type of the predisposing RB1 gene variant as indicated by retinoblastoma penetrance. From 1940 to 2008, 655 national patients were treated for heri-table retinoblastoma at the German referral center. Com- plete information on SPMs until 2012 and data on constitutional RB1 variant was available for 317 patients (48.3%). With respect to the type, predisposing RB1 gene variants were classi ed by observed blastoma (incomplete and complete penetrance type var-iants). SPMs occurred in 51 of 317 survivors of heritable retinoblastoma. In non-irradiated retinoblastoma survivors, the incidence rate per 1,000 person years (IR) of SPMs waslower compared to the irradiated patients IR SPMs was higher in patients with completepenetrance type variants compared to incomplete type var- iants ( p< 0.05). Without previous irradiation, SPM in patients with complete penetrance type RB1 variants. The association between the type of RB1 variant and penetrance of retinoblastoma in childhood is also present with respect to the risk for SPMs later in life.

Lebedev, I. Z. Mamedov Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russian Federa-tion Introduction: Retroelement (RE) activity is one of the most important causes of human genome instability. Somatic insertions of L1 and Alu were detected in some cancer types (colorectal, lung, breast). Despite the abundance of dataabout the regulation of RE activity, the exact mechanisms of RE activation in particular cancer types are still unclear. In this study we investigate the correlation between REinsertional activity in colorectal cancer and other factors, such as gene expression, L1 transcription and methylation proles of young L1 copies. Materials and Methods: sequencing libraries of L1 and Aluflanking sequences were prepared from DNA isolated from paired normal and tumor tissue samples. DigestedDNA was ligated to adapters containing unique molecular identi ers (UMI) and ampli ed with primers, speci ct o young RE subfamilies. The same DNA samples were usedfor investigation of methylation pro le of young L1-copies by enzymatic based conversion of 5-mC with subsequent ampli cation and sequencing of L1Hs promoters. Total RNA was extracted from the same tissue samples and used for RNA-seq library preparation. Results: Tumor-speci c insertions were identi ed in 18 tumors from 55 analyzed normal/tumor paired samples. In these paired samples we also identi ed L1HS-copies with demethylated promoters. We characterized the differentialexpression of genes that in fluence RE activity and transcription activity of individual L1 copies.

However, some individuals with bromatosis type 2 (NF2) schwannomatosis. Earlier identi cation of patients with these syndromes can facilitate more accurate familialrisk prediction and prognosis. Methods: Cases of sVS were ascertained from a local register at the Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine.Genetic analysis was conducted in NF2 on blood samples for all patients, and tumour DNA samples when available. LZTR1 and SMARCB1 screening was also performed in patient subgroups. Results: Age at genetic testing for VS presentation was young in comparison to previous literature, a bias resultingfrom updated genetic testing recommendations. Mosaic or constitutional germline NF2 variants were con rmed in 2%of variants in LZTR1 were found in 3% of all tested patients, with a higher rate of 5% in patients <30 years. No pathogenic SMARCB1 variants were identi ed within the cohort. Considering all indivi- duals who received tumour DNA analysis, 69% of patients were found to possess two somatic pathogenic NF2 variants, including those with germline LZTR1 pathogenic variants, supporting VS Conclusions: Undiagnosed schwannoma predisposition may account for a signi cant proportion of apparently sVS cases, especially at lower presentation ages. Loss of NF2 function is a common event in VS tumours and may represent a targetable common pathway in VS tumourigenesis. K.V. None. S. None. E. Stapleton: None. A. Taylor: None. A. Shaw: None. D.

RNF43 has been recently related to SPS, and POLE andPOLD1 to multiple polyposis predisposition. We aimed at screening for potentially pathogenic mutations in these genes in a SPScohort. Materials and methods: Initially, 39 SPS cases under- went whole-exome sequencing. Subsequently, a replicationcohort of 211 SPS patients were analyzed in a custom panel containing POLE ,POLD1 and RNF43 . Rare, potentially pathogenic ed in POLE and POLD1 and RNF43 . To date, all variants are considered as of uncertain signi cance except for the one in RNF43 (p. Arg132*). We have started functional studies usingCRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in cellular models for the frameshift POLD1 candidate variant (p.Lys648fs). Conclusions: RNF43 variants seem to be a very rare contributor to germline SPS predisposition. POLE and POLD1 variants may predispose in some cases to SPS although further functional assessment of truncatingvariants and missense variants outside the exonuclease domain of POLE and POLD1 is compulsory to evaluate their impact in germline SPS predisposition.

The basis for SPS genetic predisposition is largely unknown. Common, low-penetrance genetic var- iants have been consistently associated with CRC suscept-ibility, however, their role in SPS genetic predisposition has not been yet explored. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate if common low-penetrance genetic variants for CRC risk are also implicated in SPS genetic susceptibility. Methods: A case-control study was performed in 219 SPS patients and 548 asymptomatic controls analyzing 65 CRC susceptibility variants. A risk prediction model for SPS predisposition was developed. Results: Statistically signi cant associations with SPS were found 1.21-2.04, P-value =0.0006). A 4-fold increase in SPS risk was observed when comparing subjects within the highest decile of variants ( 65) with those in the rst decile ( 50).

Hassan II university Hospital. Medical school of University Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah, Fez, Morocco Introduction: Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are hetero- geneous group of tumors. Pathological diagnosis relies onmorphology and immunohistochemistry. It should be complemented by molecular technique, when the diagnosis is doubtful, and when it may have prognostic and/or pre-dictive relevance. This study aims to assess the clinical effect of implementation of FISH to improve sarcoma misdiagnosis. Materials and Methods: It is a retrospective study conducted in the pathology department of Hassan II university hospital between 2010 and 2018. 110 cases ofmesenchymal tumors were included. HES coloration was performed in all cases followed by immunohistochemistry. FISH was performed in all cases. Probes used were Vysisbreak apart; EWSR1, MDM2, and SS18. Results: The median age is 38 years [1-82]. On the basis of histology and immun ohistochemical stains. There were 33 ewing sarcoma, 21 synovial sarcomas, 28 l i p o m a s ,5l i p o s a r c o m a s ,a n d2 3u n c l a s s i ed sarcomas. FISH was successful in 97%. EWSR1 gene was rear-ranged in 72% of cases. For synovial sarcomas the rearrangement of SS18 was detected in was ampli dedifferentiated liposarcomas, whereas 93% of lipomas were negative, with 2 cases labelled as liposarcomas after FISH MDM2. Conclusions: This is the rst and largest moroccan series for molecular diagnosis of STS by FISH. It is important to implement this technique in a local laboratory to make itavailable at routine for moroccan patients. Our study shows that FISH improves sarcomas misdiagnosis, and it is veryAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 553useful when histology and immunohistochemistry can 't accurately classify tumors.

P12.201.B Elucidating the spliceogenic effect of variants in hereditary cancer genes: tools to prioritize RNA studies and challenges in applying ACMG guidelines P. Rofes1, M. Men\u00e9ndez1, ONCOBELL- IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain Purpose: RNA analyses are a potent tool to identify spli- ceogenic effects of DNA variants, although they are time-consuming and cannot always be performed. Here, we present splicing assays of 20 variants representing a variety of mutation types in ten hereditary cancer genes, togetherwith an attempt to incorporate these results into ACMG classi cation guidelines. Methods: We selected 16 point mutations, 3 exon duplications and one single-exon deletion prioritized by in silico algorithms. RNA was extracted from short-term lymphocyte cultures to perform RT-PCR and Sangersequencing. Whenever possible, allele-speci c expression was assessed by SNaPshot. Results: We detected aberrant transcripts in 14 variants (70%). We faced the dif culty of variant interpretation comparing old classi cation standards to generic ACMG guidelines and devised a proposal to weight functionalanalyses at RNA level. According to ACMG guidelines only 12 were reclassi ed as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, since the remaining two did not gather enough evidence. Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of RNA studies to improve variant classi cation. However, it also evidences the challenge of incorporating these resultsinto generic ACMG guidelines and the need to re ne these criteria gene-speci cally. Nevertheless, 60% of variants were reclassi ed, thus improving genetic counseling and surveillance for carriers of these variants.

Scandurra 1, Italy Introduction: Genetic testing has a pivotal role in the diagnosis of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. However, variant interpretation is still a challenging stepand often the lack of functional studies leads clinicians to classify them as variants of uncertain signi cance (VUS). RNA functional studies can improve the characterization ofvariants thus allowing the implementation of personalized strategies in cancer patient care. Materials and Methods: VUSs were analysed using the Human Splicing Finder (HSF) software, to predict the effect of intronic and exonic variants on splicing. Thereafter, RNA was extracted from short-term lymphocyte cultures (96h)from peripheral blood and /or from lymphoblastoid lines, both in presence and absence of puromycin to inhibit Nonsense Mediated Decay. cDNA was obtained andampli cation products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing to detect any abnormal splicing patterns. Results and Discussion: A total of fourteen VUS, twelve intronic and two exonic, in the following exon incorporation as a consequence of intronic sequence changes. In the remaining four no differences wereobserved in transcript sequences in both untreated and puromycin-treated cultures. Conclusions: Our study shows that 71% of the splicing variants analyzed by RNA sequencing can be reclassi ed as pathogenetic or likely pathogenetic. These preliminary data554 J. del Picchiasuggest that RNA analysis should be a part of the diagnostic workflow in patients with VUS in hereditary cancer predisposition genes in order to improve genetic testing accuracy and patients managment.

Genome Imaging Hastie Bionano Genomics, San Diego, CA, United States Genome instability is a key hallmark of cancer as it allows the genome to acquire growth advantage by amplifying or creating oncogenes by creating gene fusions and by delet- ing/inactivating tumor suppressor genes. Several genefusions have been discovered and exploited for therapies as they produce fusion proteins that can be targeted by che- motherapeutics such as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors targetingBCR-ABL used to treat CML. In addition, other genomic fusions serve as diagnostic or prognostic indicators impor- tant for cancer management. Whole genome approaches todetect fusions have innate limitations, for example, kar- yotyping is low resolution and whole genome sequencing is blind in the ~66% of the genome containing repeats. Bio-nano genome imaging is able ll the gap, it provides high resolution and ability to span genomic repeats. Here we demonstrate an easy, fluid, largely automated workflow for whole genome detection of fusions and other somatic variants. The Bionano work flow involves a novel rapid isolation protocol for extremely high molecularweight DNA, labeling the DNA to create a barcode across the genome and automated data collection using the Bionano Saphyr instrument. This complete assay can beconducted within 4 days from tissue to variant calls. We detected numerous fusions that have not previously been detected. In a standard assay, whole genome imaging candetect variants at 5% allele with increased coverage down to 1% allele fraction can be efciently detected! Whole genome optical mapping for fusion detection is surely going to play an increasing role in cancer research going forward. A. Hastie: A.

Since no simple technique is available that detects all relevant abnormalities, the choice of techniques is depending on the referral reason.Therefore, we tested targeted transcriptome sequencing as a single platform to detect all relevant variants compared to current techniques. Material and Methods: In a cohort of 136 primary diagnosed leukemia patients we performed RNA sequen- cing of 1,385 genes (TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer, Illumina).We used a decision tree based on principle component analysis of expression pro les to guide leukemia classi ca- tion. Gene fusions were analyzed in a virtual myeloid and lymphoid panel of 54 and 72 genes, respectively. Results werecompared to current techniques. Results: Compared to current techniques speci city for detecting relevant variants was 100%. Two variants in BCL2 overexpression with t(14;18)(q32;q21) in 5% of the cells. With RNA sequencing six additional fusion genes and intwo samples overexpression of CCND1 , due to a t(11;14) (q13;q32), were detected. We predicted leukemia classi ca- tion correctly in 81% of patients and improved classi cation in three patients. Conclusions: Targeted RNA sequencing combined with our work flow for data analysis is feasible and improves detection of relevant variants. Expression patterns can assist to establish the leukemia subtype. The diagnostic value of our novel approach will be tested in a large prognosticcohort.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 555B.

Given that telomere maintenance is crucialfor cancer progression, OGG1 inhibition could represent an attractive and unexplored opportunity for compromising telomere integrity in cancer cells. Materials and Methods: We characterized OGG1 repair dynamics at telomeres in the U20S cancer cell line and we investigated the consequences at telomeres of eitherCRISPR-Cas9 mediated OGG1 depletion or pharmacologi- cal with the recently developed OGG1 inhibitor TH5487. Results: we found that OGG1 is recruited to the telomeres in response to oxidative stress. Besides, Upon induction of oxidative DNA damage, lack of OGG1 activityimpairs BER at telomeres causing accumulation of oxidative DNA damage, telomere losses and consequently inducing mitotic and proliferation defects. Conclusions: Our ndings demonstrate that OGG1 is required to preserve telomere homeostasis under oxidative stress conditions in cancer cells and, present OGG1inhibitors as a tool to induce oxidative DNA damage attelomeres, with potential implications in cancer and aging research.

The presence of thesegenetic alterations across a large spectrum of thyroid lesions suggests that they might be an early mutational event in a subset of indolent thyroid lesions that are prone to developmetastases and dedifferentiate. However, it is still not clear whether additional genetic events are needed to progress from a benign in situ to an invasive and more aggressivetumor phenotype. Material and Methods: To identify new point mutations, fusions or alteration of gene expression that could cooperatewith RAS orPAX8/PPARG , we performed and analyzed RNA-seq from 14 thyroid tumors samples harboring RAS point mutation or PAX8/PPARG fusion. GRCh38 was used as reference genome. We additionally analyzed RNA-seq from 65 thyroid carcinomas positive for RAS orPAX8/ PPARG rearrangement available through The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). Results: Forty ve percent of RAS positive thyroid carcinomas showed exclusive mutations in genes thatbelong to the same pathway, which regulates important cellular processes as growth and division and recently has been associated with tumor progression. Additionally, theexpression levels of coding genes that belong to this556 J. del Picchiapathway were also altered in both our own and TCGA carcinoma samples evaluated in this study. Conclusions: We here identi ed somatic mutations in genes that belong to the same pathway in a large fraction of RAS positive cancer samples suggesting that they may cooperate with RAS to drive thyroid tumor progression.

Shel-terin mul- tiple malignancies. Three probands shared c.604G>C, which results in alternative splicing causing early truncation of the protein. This variant was maternally inherited in twoprobands. The second variant, c.557del (p.(Ser186fs), cau- ses a premature stop codon. These six individuals in this study developed 13 malignancies, including three papillarythyroid cancers and three breast cancers. No LOH or second hits in TINF2 were observed in three tumors tested. The truncated TIN2 proteins encoded by c.604G>C andc.557del do not interact with TRF1, a main factor in telo- mere length control. Consistent with loss of TRF1 binding, three patients had lymphocyte telomere lengths in the 99 th percentile. CRISPR/Cas9 edited RPE1 cells heterozygous for the TINF2 variants that the truncated TIN2 proteins do not cause telomere damage or genomeinstability but result in telomere elongation. The data establish that the TINF2 variants predispose to cancer through inappropriate telomere elongation and suggest thattelomere shortening is a potent tumor suppressor pathway in multiple cancer types. We suggest that previously described cancer-predisposing POT1 variants also act through genome instability.I. A. Mensenkamp: None. M. Haadsma: None. L. Spruijt: None. R. de Voer: None.

Bahsi Department of Medical Genetics, University of Health Sciences, Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Non-small-cell lung cancer constitutes 80% part of all lung cancers. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene in the DNA damage pathway, and also is the most frequently mutated gene in various malignancies. According to the AACR Project GENIE Consortium, TP53 mutations present in 41.88% of all non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients. Due to the many carcinogens in tobacco smoke, smoking- related cancers have a high genome-wide burden of muta-tions. To support this theory, TP53 mutation prevalence of smoker and non-smoker non-small-cell lung cancer patients were compared with liquid biopsy. Materials and Methods: Totally, circulating tumor DNA of 82 smoker non-small-cell lung cancer patients and 51 never-smoker non-small-cell lung cancer patients wereperformed using commercially available liquid biopsy platforms. TP53 gene hotspot regions were analyzed. Variants were evaluated according to AMP/ASCO/CAPclassi cation guidelines. Only Tier I and Tier II variants were reported. Results: TP53 mutations were described in 41/133 (30.8%) of the samples. In never-smokers 12/51 (23.5%) patients and in smokers, 30/82 (36.5%) patients carry a TP53 mutation. Moreover, the prevalence of truncating mutations was higher in smokers 8/30 (26.6%) compared to non-smokers 2/16 (16.6%). Conclusions: Tobacco exposure causes a heavy burden of genomic alterations in TP53 at somatic level in non- small-cell lung cancer. The higher incidence of truncating mutations in smokers shows that the damaging effect of theresulting mutations is higher in smokers than never- smokers.

Aretz1,2 1Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany,2Center for Hereditary Tumor Syndromes, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany Introduction: Cowden syndrome (CS) is the adult onset subtype of the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome and a cancer predisposition syndrome, primarily linked to germ-linePTEN mutations. However, in 30-40% of patients with suspected CS, no causative PTEN mutation can be identi- ed in routine diagnostics. In particular, pathogenic variants located outside the coding regions remain undetected. Material and Methods: To uncover deep intronic PTEN mutations, ten clinically well characterized, unrelatedpatients with suspected CS and missing PTEN mutation were tested for aberrant splicing by cDNA analysis. In addition, three splice variants(PTEN:c.209 +5G>A, PTEN:c.634 +5G>A, PTEN:c.210- 12C>G) The coding exons 1-9 of PTEN were ampli ed in three overlapping fragments using speci c primers. Ampli cation products were separated by gel-electrophoresis and sequenced in both directions. Deviant patterns were excised,eluted, reampli ed, and sequenced. Results: In the three patients with an intronic variant, the pathogenicity could be con rmed: In two patients, an exon deletion was found, and in one patient an insertion of 11bp could be revealed. All unexplained patients did not show aberrant patterns on the gel-image. Currently, sequencing ofthe PCR products is being performed cryptic splice variants resulting in short aberrations. Conclusions: Rare, pathogenic deep intronic germline mutations have already been described in several hereditary tumor syndromes. However, systematic screening of a small cohort of unexplained CS patients did not detect aberrantsplicing so far. In contrast, suspected splice variants in three patients could be con rmed by the transcript analysis. A.K. Sommer: None. F. Kratz: None. J. Kionke: None. S.

Currently, it is included in prognostic scoring system as high-risk aberration. However, the prognostic value of t(14;16) remains controversial as itwas not con rmed in several MM series. Thus, further studies are needed to verify its true clinical relevance. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and prognosticimpact of t(14;16) in our cohort of patients. Material and Methods: During 2004-2019 we examined bone marrow samples of 1100 MM patients using FISH onimmuno fluorescently labeled plasma cells (cIg FISH). t (14;16) was veri ed with dual fusion probe (Abbott). Kaplan-Maier analysis was performed to evaluate the overal(OS) and event-free (EFS) survival of IGH/MAF positive cases. Results: t(14;16) was detected in 26/1100 patients (2,4%). The atypical FISH pattern of fusion signals and numerical changes of 14q32 and 16q23 regions were detected in 8 and 10 cases, respectively. In 17 patients(65%), two or more additional CA were observed. t(14;16) with another high-risk CA - deletion of TP53 - was found in four patients, three of them died within the short periodfrom the diagnosis (9-15 months). We proved the signicantly shorter OS in t(14;16) positive cases (p=0,1), for EFS the difference was not signi cant. Conclusions: In this study, the frequency of t(14;16) was consistent with published data and our results support its negative prognostic impact.

It is highly aggressive disease, more common occurring in younger women and is associated with her-editary forms of breast cancer caused by pathogenic muta- tions, mostly in the BRCA1/2 genes. Methods: In the present study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze mutations in FFPE (formalin xed embedded) tissues samples of 12 patients with triple- negative breast cancer (mean agewas 50,8 years). gen (Roche) custom panel of oligonucleotide probes. The sequencing was performed on MiSeq up to1000x. Results: Both germline and somatic mutations in tumor cells have been identi ed comparing sequencing results from paired tumor and normal tissue samples. Two pathogenic germline mutations were found in the BRCA1 gene (185delAG,3347delAG), mutations in the BRCA2(886delGT) and TP53(c.733G>A) genes. Pathogenic somatic mutations were found in MUTYH (c.734G > A), PTEN (c.640C>T) and TP53 (c.637C > T) genes. Thegenotyping results were compared with clinical data. Conclusion: Triple-negative breast cancer is a hetero- geneous group of diseases. Knowledge of genetic pro les and identi cation of predictive biomarkersis important for further improvement of therapy results.

B. Sadowski H. M. Oldakowski Bionano Genomics, San Diego, CA, United StatesOptical mapping with Bionano Genome imaging is a pow- erful tool for comprehensive detection of structural variations (SVs) in cancer genomes. A crucial step in this work flow is isolating intact UHMW gDNA. For routine study of leu-kemic samples, we developed Bionano Prep SP kits for rapid, solution phase, isolation of UHMW gDNA from blood and BMAs. We also developed a rare variant bioinformaticpipeline that detects SVs at 5 % allele fraction. Together, these can potentially replace a suite of \"classical \"cytogenetic tests for leukemia analysis (karyotyping, FISH, CNVmicroarrays) with a single Bionano Genome Imaging ana- lysis. For solid tumors, we developed a novel protocol to isolate UHMW gDNA from small amounts ( 10 mg) of fresh frozen tissues. Homogenized tissues are processed with the Bionano Prep SP kit, where lysis is coupled with pur- ication steps to bind, wash and elute UHMW gDNA. With this protocol, a batch of 8 samples can be processed in <6h. Eluted UHMW gDNA (3-19 g DNA/10 mg) is compatible with Direct Label and Stain protocol. When run on a SaphyrChip, the puri ed gDNA gives high throughputs (>1.3 Tbp/ sample in 24h) with excellent single molecule metrics of DNA size (N50>150 kbp of 260-300 kbp) and mapping rate(80-92%), suf use in SV analysis of cancer gen- omes from solid tumors. This protocol has been tested on fresh frozen human tumors including liver, lung, kidney,bladder, brain, colon, thyroid, prostate, breast, and ovary. A comprehensive analysis of SVs in these tumors will be presented. H.B. Sadowski: A. (full uveal melanoma P. E. Repo 1Folkh\u00e4lsan Research Center, Helsinki, Finland,2Depart- ment of Ophthalmology, University of Helsinki and HelsinkiUniversity Hospital, Helsinki, FinlandIntroduction: Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular cancer in adults. Metastases develop in approximately 50% of patients with poor prognosis regardless of treatment. UM tumors generally acquire unusually few somatic mutations. Eight genes are recognized as drivers of its tumorigenesis, typically consisting of one mutually exclusivemutation in G N A Q ,G N A 1 1 ,P L C B 4 orCYSLTR2 followed by one mutually exclusive mutation in EIF1AX ,SF3B1, SRSF2 orBAP1 . Germline variants in BAP1 . Recently, germline loss-of- function (LOF) variants in the methyl-CpG binding domain-4 (MBD4) gene were found in four patients with UM. Loss of functional MBD4 induces a hypermutated pro le, making tumors susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We conducted a population based screening of MBD4 in Finnish patients with UM to identify pathogenic variants. Materials and Methods: Sanger sequencing of MBD4 in 440 Finnish patients with UM. Results: We identi ed eight exonic missense variants in 51 (12%) patients. Only one is likely to alter MBD4 function. We found no LOF variants (95% con dence interval [CI], 0.0-0.8%). Frequency of LOF variants in the general Finnish population is 0.052% in gnomAD, suggesting one might occur by chance in one in 2000 patients with UM. Conclusions: Germline variants altering MBD4 function do not seem to predispose to UM in Finland. Somatic biallelic loss of MBD4 might modify the mutational burdenin UM and change its response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Kilic1 1Erasmus MC, del PicchiaIntroduction: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a familial disorder characterized by a predisposition to develop retinal haemangioblastomas among other tumours. Phenotypic has led to a dif culty in the management of RH. We aimed to different ocular phenotypes in VHL patientswith structural VHL variants in different functional domains. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of a longitudinal cohort of 33 VHL germline mutation carriers and RH. Clinical and genetic data was obtained to analyse the correlation of genotype with phenotype. Results: VHL patients were categorised in genotypic categories, based on the presumed effect on the VHL protein. Interface A is important for VCB-complex forma-tion, interface B forms the HIF- binding site, and interface C plays a role in the Cullin-2 interaction. Twelve patients had a mutation that corresponds with interface C, 11patients in interface A, and 9 patients in interface B. One patient had a whole gene deletion. An aggressive ocular phenotype was most observed in patients with mutations ininterface C (75%), followed by interface B (44.4%) and interface A (18.2%). The highest number of amino acid substitutions were present in the interface C domain, where50% of the variants were missense mutations. Conclusions: Variants in the domain that corresponds with the interaction with Cullin-2 are more often missensemutations and had a higher prevalence of an aggressive ocular phenotype of RH in this study. The scaffold protein Cullin-2 seems to play a more important role in theprogression of RH. A. Hajjaj: None. K.A. van Overdam: None. Oldenburg: None. E. Brosens: None. A.M.W. van den Ouweland: None.

In addition, we identi ed an SNV located in mir-153 seed side of the 3 ' UTR region of AKT1 gene, c.*437c>T, which was pre- viously found to associate with lung cancer. In other fourfamilies, we detected novel nonsynonymous variants with high potential of pathogenicity due to their low frequencies in the general population and conserved residue in theprotein levels: BRCA1 gene and c.128G>A in PHB gene. In other 9 families, no suspected variants were found. Further studies are needed to con rm the patho- genicity of the detected variants, but our study demonstrates the vast variability of genetic causes for hereditary cancer in our population, the complexity of the mechanisms in familial cancer, and the challenge of detecting those muta- tions for better clinical approach and genetic counselingpurposes.

Wnt signaling is mediated through the interaction of 19 Wnt ligands and 10 Frizzled receptors; however thespecicity of their interaction and their clinical signi cance remains and 82 breast tumours were determined by RT-PCR and the Ct method. Possible correlations of Wnt pathway components 'expression levels with clinicopathological data were investigated. Results: In breast carcinomas, decreased relative expression levels of and 82% ofAbstracts from the of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 561carcinomas, respectively. Furthermore, increased relative mRNA expression levels were observed in WNT3 in 54% of the cases. Expression levels of WNT3 FZD6 were signicantly correlated with WNT5A ,FZD4 ranged from 25-40% of the samples and WNT2 ,WNT3 levels were determined at 59% and 60% respectively. Noclinicopathological correlation was found in colorectal cancer. Positive linear correlations were established among several of the investigated genes in both types of cancer. Conclusions: Deregulated expression of the investigated genes was found in both breast and colorectal cancer. The linear correlations determined among Wnts and Frizzledsare indicative of their functional interaction and could point out the complexity that characterizes the Wnt-Frizzled interactions in breast and colon carcinogenesis.

I. number variations in patients with oro- facial cleft defects with or without congenital heartdisease La Sabana, Ch\u00eda, Colombia, Colombia Introduction: Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) and congenital heart disease (CHD) are the most common malformations observed in newborns. 15-20% of patients with CL/P andCHD can carry some type of chromosome abnormality. Between 5 to 8% of CL/P cases and 75 to 80% of CHD cases present the cryptic chromosomal microdeletion22q11.2. Herein, we identi ed the genetic abnormalities in patients with CL/P and CHD using cytogenetic and MLPA analysis. Materials and Methods: 14 patients with CL/P and CHD from Operation Smile Foundation (Bogot\u00e1-Colombia) were included in this study. G-banded chromosome analysisand 22q11 region was studied P250- B2)and/or FISH (TUPLE1-HIRA LSR ARSA) techniques. Clinical parameters were evaluated in all patients. Results: Patients 'age ranged 2-20 years (median 7 years). 28.6% of the patients showed CP and 71.4% CLP, phenotypic traits included abnormalities in male genital organs (66.6%), alterations in bone tissue (57.2%), abnormalities in the teeth (50%),delayed language development (42.9%), and mental disorders (100%). All patients had normal karyotype. One male patient (20 years) carried the 22q11.2 microdeletion,and another female patient (19 years) carried the micro- duplication of TOP3B gene located on 22q11.2 region. Both cases had CL/P and CHD including persistent arterialductus, and congenital mitral valve abnormalities and bivalve aorta, respectively. Conclusions: Screening of 22q11.2 alterations in patients with CL/P and CHD would be very helpful in their early diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling. D.M. Cardenas-Nieto: None. J.

The 22q11.2 regioninvolved in the deletion is quite complex and contains highly repetitive low copy repeats (LCR), DNA sequences that make the region susceptible to recurrent genomicrearrangements. Our studies, as well as others in the lit- erature, indicate that 22q11.2 deletion syndrome results in a wide variety of heterogeneous clinical signs, such as con-genital cardiac malformations, characteristic facial features, immune de ciency, and psychiatric disorders. One of the hypotheses lies in the fact that allelic variation, such asindels, within the non-deleted 22q11.2 allele or in other562 J. del Picchiagenes 22q11.2 region could in fluence the phe- notype outcome of the 22q11.2DS.

To predict indels that may have a role as modi ers, we used genomic variants ltering by deep learning models in NGS (GARFIELD-NGS),which rely on machine learning models to ef ciently distinguish clinically pathogenic from neutral indels.

Leuven, Belgium,2Centre for Research and Conservation, Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium,3Department of Biology, University of Bari, Bari, Italy Introduction: Low copy repeats (LCRs) are amongst the most complex regions in the human genome. Scrutinizingthese structures unraveled their importance during evolu- tion. LCRs play an important role in the disease mechanism of genomic disorders as well. Non-allelic homologousrecombination between chromosome 22 cause the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. LCR22-A hyper- variability was uncovered in human. However, it remainsunknown whether such variability is human speci co ri s also a feature of other primates. Materials and Methods: The LCR22 variability in the Great Apes was charted using an LCR22-speci cber- FISH. The structures of ve chimpanzees, one bonobo, two gorillas, and six orangutans were de novo assembled toassess the level of inter- and intraspecies variation. In addition, we used Bionano optical mapping to chart the overall 22q11.2 structure of the orangutans. Results: The chimpanzee and bonobo harbored the smallest LCR22-A allele observed in humans, containingcore duplicons, without intra-species variation. The gorilla haplotype had small expansions compared to the chimpan- zee. In contrast, the overall 22q11.2 region is different in the orangutan, including rearrangements in the sequence between the LCR22s, intra-individual structural variation, and LCR22-A haplotypes not resembling the human ones. Conclusions: For the rst time, the LCR22s subunits were evolutionary charted and uncovered lineage-speci c differences. The LCR22-A hypervariability is humanspecic, since no structural variation was observed in chimpanzee or bonobo. This suggests an important role of the locus in human adaptation and evolution.

Many cases of female monozygotic (MZ)twins discordant for BWS have been reported, but no denitive conclusions have been drawn regarding the linkAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 563between epigenetic defects, twinning process, and gender. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization and follow-up of female MZ twins discordant for BWS. Methods: 11p15.5 methylation pattern and multilocus methylation ling were performed by pyrosequencing and MassARRAY in pre- and post-nataltissues. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) mutations. X-chromosome inacti- vation (XCI) status was by HUMARA test. Results: Both twins share ICR2 LOM and MLID in blood and the epigenetic defect in the healthy twin remained stable over time. ICR2 LOM appeared non-homogenouslydistributed in the placental samples. Twins shared the same severe XCI skewing pattern. No MLID causative mutations were identi ed by WES. Conclusion: This is the rst reported case in which methylation analyses was extended to extraembryonic tissues, and results suggest that caution is required whenattempting prenatal diagnosis in similar cases. Although the causative mechanism of LOM remains unsolved, the XCI pattern, along with mosaic LOM, suggests that bothtwinning and LOM/MLID occurred after XCI commitment.

It man- ifests through the proteins involved in carotenoid intestinal absorption and metabolism, blood lipoprotein transport ortissue uptake. This study aims to identify novel SNPs which could be associated with carotenoid serum concentrations.Materials and Methods: 265 measured (Shimadzu ProminenceHPLC system). According to the carotenoid concentrations individuals were subdivided in to the quartiles. Q1 and Q4 were used for the following association analysis.

Ferreira1, A. Ferro1, Portugal,2Department of Faculty of of Porto, Porto, Portugal Introduction: CDH1 encodes E-Cadherin which epithelial tissue architecture and cell-cell adhesion. CDH1 impairment is associated with metastatic spread in most epithelial cancers (somatic), early-onset of gastric andbreast cancer and cleft-lip/palate (germline), however the germline and somatic mechanisms described so far can 't justify all CDH1 -associated phenotypes. We explored expression pro le changes induced by structural variations564 J. del Picchiaacross the CDH1 gene body to infer the role of coding and non-coding sequences. Material and Methods: tory element (iCRE) and an intronic portion not assigned to regulatory function (Partial_intron). Obtained clones werecharacterized by qRT-PCR, western-blotting and immuno- cytochemistry and further studied through RNA-Seq followed by Differential Expression (DE) analysis usingthe DESeq2 package. Conclusions: Compared to parental cells, Exon_deletion triggers CDH1 loss, with 19-downregulated and 34- upregulated the Top-5 pathways associated with in flammatory-responses; iCRE deletion also triggers CDH1 loss, having 1106-downregulated and 1238- upregulated genes and its Top-5 pathways are with 220-upregulated genes, the Top-5 pathways are vasoconstriction and blood-vessel size. Both clones harbouring CDH1 LoF share 35 DE genes, and only 10 genes are DE in all clones. Our CRISPR/ Cas9 assay reveals unanticipated transcriptomic conse-quences of CDH1 -locus associated structural variation and demonstrates that different portions of the locus play different regulatory functions.

P13.09.B New pathogenic structural variants responsible for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease I. 1, Limoges, Introduction: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most common hereditary neuropathy characterized by damagesof both motor and sensory peripheral nerves. CMT trans- mission modes can be various (dominant, recessive, auto- somal or X-linked) and there are more than 90 genes involved. PMP22 duplication was the rst described mutation in this disease, explaining around 15% of CMT patients. However, to date, the majority of the reportedmutations in CMT patients are single nucleotide variants detected by targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Structural Variants (SVs) have rarely been described.The aim of our study was to identify new SVs involved in CMT disease. Materials and Methods: DNA from 695 CMT patients were analysed by NGS using an amplicon targeted sequencing panel and we performed a speci c bioinformatic analysis of NGS data by Cov 'Cop and CovCopCan softwares looking for new pathogenic SVs involved in CMT. Results: Thank to this approach, we found new SVs in 107 CMT patients, highlighting the importance of SVs analysis during CMT patients 'examination. 28 were small deletions (3-6 amplicons), 10 were large deletions, 49 weresmall duplications and 20 were large duplications. We will focus here on two of these large deletions, we proved then to be responsible for our patients 'disease. Conclusions: These SVs would not have been detected using the typical NGS analyses. We believe our strategy using Cov 'Cop and CovCopCan could increase the diagnosis rate of patients suffering from neuropathies and could be used by molecular biologists and geneticists to improve diagnosis of all inherited diseases.

An example of these are regulatory changes near PRDM13 or IRX1 in autosomal dominant North Carolina Macular NCMD has a recognizable phenotypeof the central retina, making it interesting for regulatory variants. We aimed at dissecting the regulatory landscapes ofPRDM13 andIRX1 tond novel causes of NCMD and to understand disease mechanisms. Methods: Chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq and UMI-4C) was applied on postmortem adult humanretinas to ne-map interactions of retinal CREs with the PRDM13 and IRX1 promoters. Interaction pro les were integrated with additional retinal epigenomic data in UCSC.Twenty- ve NCMD families underwent assessment of known defects followed by whole genome sequencing. Results: 4C-seq and UMI-4C pro les, together retinal epigenomic pro les, revealed noncoding putative CREs interacting with the PRDM13 andIRX1 promoters. One of them overlaps with a novel noncoding sequencevariant located upstream of PRDM13 , and is active in developmental central retina. Interestingly, another novel and known noncoding variant at the same position and anovel duplication overlap with a noncoding putative CRE upstream of PRDM13 containing a DNase hypersensitive site. Conclusions: Retinal interaction pro les of the PRDM13 andIRX1 regions advance the interpretation of noncoding variants and provide insight into the cis-regulatory mechan- isms underlying NCMD. The genetic architecture of NCMD was expanded with novel noncoding variants with a likely on PRDM13 regulation. FWO/1802220N; EJPRD19- 234 Solve-RET. S. Van de Sompele: None. E. D 'haene: None. T.

V. de Gen\u00e8ve, Geneva, Switzerland While WGS is being largely used in scienti c research, its application in the diagnostic routine is still lagging behind. In order to develop a pipeline for the identi cation of SVs from short-reads WGS data that can be translated intotransferred to clinical purposes we tested 7 previously published (publically available) algorithms for SV identi - cation and evaluated their Sensitivity and False-Discovery-Rate. We observed variable level of sensitivity (36-87%) depending on the tool and SV type and size. Read-depth approaches worked better for large deletions (79-86%),while combined paired/split-reads approaches gave better identi cation of small deletions (81-94%). High sensitivity was found for insertions (93%) and inversions (96-100%).As described by others, we report a high number of False Positives (FP) (10 2-103) as main issue. To reduce FP, we decided to use one to two tools for each SV type andselected the one with highest sensitivity. After ltering based on quality parameters, SVs were annotated using annotSV and candidate SVs were selected based on fre-quency, involved genes and inheritance pattern. We applied the approach to a rst set of 8 patients for whom no genetic cause was identi ed using aCGH and panel targeted whole exome sequencing a few years ago. The rst results include identi cation of an homozygous 22.6 kb deletion encom- passing 5 'UTR and exon 1 of ERGIC1 in a patient with arthrogryposis. Biallelic mutations of ERGIC1 were pre- viously associated to arthrogryposis in a single family. Of note, this gene was initially not included in our WES genepanel for this pathology. C.

Commonly observed in cancer, chromothripsis-like rearrangements alsooccur as a rare event in the germline. We investigated 10 cases with congenital complex or even chromothripsis-like rearrangements and surprisingly mild phenotypes, despitemassive large-scale rearrangements. To understand and predict the pathogenic effects of rearrangements, a recon- struction of the shattered chromosomes with precise map-ping of the breakpoints is needed. However, due to the high error rate in breakpoint detection by short-read whole-gen- ome sequencing this remains challenging. Here, we address these issues by combining Hi-C with PacBio long-read sequencing for the reconstruction of patient genomes. Hi-C was very ef cient and sensitive in detecting large scale rearrangements and provided a global coarse-grained atlas of the fusion events and information on their layout. In contrast, PacBio reads provided ne-grained local information of breakpoints, due to long (10-50 kb) reads and the reduced sensitivity to repetitive regions. Hi-C was used to evaluate the breakpoint calls obtained fromPacBio sequencing thereby reducing the candidate list to 5- 50 rearrangements > 5 Mb per individual. In a next step, the derivative chromosomes were reconstructed using bothtechnologies jointly. The potentially pathogenic effects of these highly rearranged genomes were assessed by mappingthe breakpoints in the context of 3D chromatin structure and topologically associated domains (TADs). Thus, we present an efcient method for the reconstruction and evaluation of shattered chromosomes in a cohort of individuals with chromothripsis-like rearrangements. R. Sch\u00f6p flin:None. U.

Recent advancements in sequencing technology, however, have opened up new avenues for studying and characterizingglobal genomic IR-induced effects. Here, we present our investigation of putative IR-induced mutation signatures in of humangingiva broblasts (HGFs), which were exposed doses of X-radiation in combination with dif- ferent post-exposure repair intervals. For our analyses wedeveloped a bioinformatics work flow incorporating three stringent ltering steps for the removal of non-IR induced variants, to eliminate sequencing errors and to removevariants with low sequencing coverage. We studied the accumulation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as insertions and deletions (Indels) and statistically analyzedthe accumulation of variants with respect to different genomic features such as cytogenetic bands and topologi- cally associating domains (TAD). SNVs showed low tran-sition/transversion (Ti/Tv) mutation ratios, while the number of deletions exceeded the number of insertions. SNVs in gene sets related to stress response and DNA-repair, were situated mostly in intronic, up- or downstream regions and sequence ontology analyses showed that theyAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 567were mostly neutral without effects on protein function. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a char- acteristic genomic meta-signature of variants after IR exposure. Furthermore, effects related to structural and/or functional chromatin domains of particular chromosomal areas were noted, which may re flect DNA repair pathway choice. N. Nath: None. L.

To understand the extent and characteristics of missing information, wejuxtaposed GRCh38 with high-contiguity genome assembly (AK1) of of AK1 sequences which harbors ~1,390 putative coding elements. To validate the possible information loss, we analyzed the \"unmapped \"(to GRCh38) reads of fourteen individuals ' deep sequencing data (5 East-Asians, 4 Europeans, and 5 Africans), to nd that ~5.3 Mbp of previously deserted unmapped sequences were recovered by using AK1 asreference. The recovered regions included 38 globally shared ( 7 individuals out of 14) regions with >25 candidate coding elements. We also veri ed that many of these common missing regions in GRCh38 existed in multiple populations and a chimpanzee by PCR analysis.

No assessment of their prevalence has yet been made in con- sanguineous populations. Materials and Methods: DNA from 225 severely obese probands (BMI-SDS>3.5), were rst screened for the mutations in LEP andMC4R genes by Sanger sequencing. This was then followed by an in-house developed augmented whole-exome sequencing (CoDE-seq) enabling direct and simultaneous detection of CNVs and pointmutations in coding regions. The variants associated with obesity were graded according to ACMG criteria to predict pathogenicity. Results: We report 110 cases (49%) with 55 different pathogenic variations (49 point mutations; 6 CNVs), in known monogenic obesity obesity were identi ed in BBSs and ALMS1 (15.5% and 3.5% of ( LEPR ,PWS , 16p11.2) for 5.5% of patients.

Lastly we568 J. del Picchiahighlighted variants in 4 potential candidate genes for obesity warranting further investigation. Conclusions: Here, we demonstrate a remarkably high frequency (49% plus potentially 10%) of monogenic obesity in a consanguineous population.

M. characterisation of NF1 in Cypriot neuro - bromatosis type 1 patients A. 1, Makarios III Medical Centre, Nicosia, Cyprus Introduction: NF1 is a large gene containing at least 57 exons and encoding a protein sized 2818 aminoacids. NF1 mutations are generally associated to Neuro bromatosis type 1, an autosomal dominant disease characterised by caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and neuro bromas. Studying the NF1 gene has been challenging over the years due to its largesize and the similarity it shares with over seven NF1 pseudogenes. Materials and Methods: Forty patients with suspected or conrmed clinical diagnosis of neuro bromatosis type 1, were screened with NGS (Haloplex and Sureselect panels from Agilent), Sanger 11(37%) variants were novel. Eight (28%) of all variants were nonsense, 8 (28%) were missense, 6 (21%) were located on splice sites (3 were investigated and resulted in exonskipping), 1 (3%) was an Indel and 6 (21%) were all novel frameshift variants. Two (5% of all patients), harboured an NF1 multi-exon deletion, and a whole NF1 gene deletion,respectively. More than half of all variants detected, lie in exons that share >90% similarity with NF1 pseudogenes. The identi ed variants were equally distributed along the gene.Conclusions: We present the rst study done in neuro bromatosis type 1 Cypriot patients, in which nonsense and missense changes are the most common type of variants observed. We highlight the importance of copy number testing in neuro bromatosis patients as well as distinguishing true pathogenic variants from variantsoccurring in NF1 pseudogenes. A.

Ludwig1 1Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany, 2Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), Uni- versity of Cologne, Cologne, Germany,3Institute of Biomedicine Cantabria (IBBTEC),University of Cantabria, Cantabria, Spain Non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/ P) is among the most common birth defects worldwide. Its etiology is multifactorial with a strong genetic component, which is supported by previous identi cation of 45 risk loci through GWAS. As the majority of risk loci map to non- coding regions, molecular effects on gene regulation or chromatin organization have been suggested. However, thetranslation of genetic ndings into pathomechanisms is challenging, due to the early embryonic time point of facial development and thus, the lack of accessible relevanthuman tissues for functional analyses. Our group has pre- viously shown that associated risk variants for nsCL/P are strongly enriched in active regulatory elements of humanneural crest cells (hNCCs). To unravel genomic interactions and possible target genes of associated variants, we are performing circular chromosome conformation capture (4C)in hNCCs. We selected one novel risk locus on chr.20q13 to establish the method. According to GTEx, the lead SNP is an eQTL for EYA2 in multiple tissues. Notably, EYA2 is a developmental gene expressed in hNCCs that is involved in cellular mechanisms such as migration and apoptosis. Our preliminary data based on the viewpoint around the sentinelSNP suggest an interaction between its region and the promoter region of EYA2 . Analyses using the promoter region of EYA2 as a second viewpoint and allele-speci c investigations are currently on the way, to validate the interaction. Overall, our approach will help to identify targetAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 569genes that are involved in the molecular pathology of nsCL/ P at GWAS loci.

P13.27.B A new genetic variants in DNAI2 detected by target sequencing in a newborn with Primary CiliaryDyskinesia M. Rocca 1, C. Vinanzi1, A. Ciliary disease characterized by motile cilia dysfunction.Clinical manifestations of this disease include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, laterality defects and infertility. To date, mutations in approximately 40 differentgenes have been found to be causative of PCD. Here, we report the case of a new-born with PCD carrying a new homozygous deletion in DNAI2 gene. Materials and Methods: Transmission electron micro- scopy was carried out for diagnosis of PCD. To identify genetic cause of disorder, DNA sequencing by a custommultigene next generation sequencing panel and aCGH were performed. Results: Transmission electron microscopy showed the absence of outer dynein arms in all analysed axonemes and abnormal inner dynein arm in more than 90% of axonemes. Target sequencing microarray of DNAI2 gene . Conclusions: In this study, we describe a novel homozygous deletion of exons 7-9 of DNAI2 found in a 4-month old respiratory distress, ventriculomegaly, situs inversus, patent foramen ovale, absent outer dyneinarms and abnormal inner dynein arms. Although most of the PCD cases are the result of mutations in gene encoding axonemal proteins or protein related to dynein armassembly, variants in DNAI2 gene are rarely found in PCD patients. The application of high-throughput technol- ogies allowed us, hence, to identify a new intragenicdeletion of DNAI2 gene that could likely cause the loss of function of the protein resulting in a severe PCD phenotype.

Four autosomal- dominant - ciency of SLC20A2 , which encodes an inorganic phosphate (Pi) importer, is a major cause of PFBC. During the analysis of exome sequencing data of 71 genetically unexplained unrelated PFBC patients, we detected an 8p11.21 deletion,mapping 35 kb upstream of SLC20A2 and segregating with PFBC in 3 patients, and assessed its consequences on gene function. Methods: We explored SLC20A2 blood expression by RT-ddPCR, performed an ex vivo Pi uptake assay and we deleted a putative SLC20A2 enhancer mapping to this region in HEK293 cells by CRISPR/Cas9. Results: The deletion carriers/normal controls levels was 60.2% ( p< 0.001). This was comparable to that of an SLC20A2 premature stop codon (63.4%, p< 0.001). The570 J. del exhibited Pi uptake in blood ( p =0.015). In HEK293 cells, we observed a 39.8% decrease in relative SLC20A2 mRNA levels after normalization on DNA copy number ( p< 0.001) in a bulk analysis. Discussion: We identi ed a deletion encompassing an enhancer of SLC20A2 expression, with carriers showing haploinsuf ciency in similar ranges than loss-of-function allele carriers. Deleting this element in a cellular model was associated with similarly reduced mRNA levels. Here, weused a simpli ed CRISPR/Cas9 assay associated to (RT-) ddPCR which allows a rapid study of DNA/RNA extracted from the cellular bulk. We propose a 3-step strategy toidentify and easily assess the effect of such non-coding events. K. Cassinari: None. A. Rovelet-Lecrux: None. S. Tury: None. O. Quenez: None. A. Richard: None. C.

Sera m 1, B. Marques1, S. analysis (CMA) is the recom- mended genetic test in pregnancies with ultrasound abnormalities allowing the identi cation of small patho- genic copy number variations (CNV). Nevertheless kar-yotype may be needed to clarify the underlying mechanism of complex rearrangements. Here we report a fetus referred for prenatal diagnosis due to cleft palate and left hydrone-phrosis uncovered during second trimester ultrasound. Affymetrix Cytoscan 750 CMA revealed a 6,7 Mb inter- stitial gain at 22q12.2q13.1 and a 2,1 Mb terminal loss at22q13.32q13.33, in a male fetus. The deletion includes SHANK3 whose haploinsuf ciency causes Phelan- McDermid syndrome (PMS) and hence considered as apathogenic CNV. Patients with PMS mainly exhibit neu- rological and behavioural symptoms, not detectable in aprenatal ultrasound, although hydronephrosis, as described in the fetus, is one of the few congenital abnormalities occasionally reported. To exclude a complex rearrangement and evaluate recurrence risk karyotype was performed both in the fetus and the parents revealing a de novo ring chro- mosome 22 in all cells analyzed. While terminal deletions inring chromosomes are expected, the non-contiguous gain/ loss identi ed here questions whether this ring could have been generated by a mechanism of chromothripsis/chro-moanagenesis, as recently described in a child with PMS and a complex ring 22. Although the duplicated region was considered of unknown clinical signi cance, the cleft palate observed in the fetus has not been described in PMS patients and may be a consequence of this more complex rearrangement. After genetic counseling the parents opted toterminate the pregnancy. S. Sera m:None. B. Marques: None. S. None. C. A.R. Tarelho: None. L. Simao: None. J. Furtado: None. S. Rangel: None. R.

The pregnancy, delivery and family history were unremarkable. Psychomotor development was con-sidered normal until 2 y.o., but slightly autistic features were recognised at 1 y.o. Seizures onset was at 18 months like as clusters of generalised tonic-clonic seizures, she hadalso daily generalised tonic seizures, myoclonic myoclonic-atonic seizures, sometimes febrile provoked. Multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and hormonal treat-ment were not effective, the best effect was on the combi- nation Carbamazepine with Levetiracetam. Severe developmental and motor regress, autistic traits, musclehypotonia with high tendon re flexes, ataxia were reported at 2 y.o. EEG at 4 y.o. showed slow background, a bifrontalAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 571and generalized discharges, low-average index in the sleep. MRI was unremarkable. Gene panel showed a variant in SCN2A gene (chr2:166170123A>G), con rmed de novo by Sanger. To investigate the potential impact of the NG_008143.1 (NM_021007.2): c.1035-7A>G variant on splicing and due to the fact that SCN2A gene expression is brain restricted, splicing minigene assay was performed.

P13.33.B Cis-acting variants modify the behavior PiS allele from moderately de cient to null phenotype in Alpha-1 (AATD) is an inherited condition characterized by reduced levels of serum AAT due to mutations in SERPINA1 gene. The PiS (Glu264Val) is one of the most frequent de cient alleles of AATD which reduce by 40% the protein level. This allele is the most frequent in Caucasians. Material and Methods: After genotyping the most frequent variants PiZ and PiS in AATD patients, there are decient individuals with lower serum levels of AAT than expected for the initial genotype that should be furtheranalyzed by sequencing coding exons of SERPINA1 gene, and protein phenotyped by isoelectric focusing. Novel variants were found and were functionally characterized byexpressing them in a cellular model. Results: We identify and characterize two new alleles carrying S mutation, but producing null phenotype. Wedescribe two previously unknown missense variants con- rmed to be in-cis conguration each of them with the S mutation, and demonstrated that they modify the propertiesof the PiS allele in terms of higher AAT intracellular retention and no extracellular secretion. Plasma samples from patients carrying these combinations con rmed null- phenotype behavior. These represent a novel type of AATD alleles that we named 'PiS-plus 'alleles, as they have more pathogenic properties comparing to typical de cient PiS alleles, and modify clinical consequences. Conclusions: Thisnding highlights that phasing genetic variants in AATD is an important issue to establish adenitive diagnosis. The discovery of different PiS-plus alleles could contribute to explain the phenotypical variability observed among patients. (Grant: AESIPI17CIII/00042). N. Matamala: None. G. Gomez-Mariano: None.

These copy-number polymorphic duplications (3-8 copies) are under positive selection and include BOLA2 , whose expansion might have an adaptive role in protecting against iron de ciency. It is unknown whether other genes mapping to this duplicate segment, like SLX1 that takes part in the SLX1-SLX4 complex involved in the control of genome stability, might have a role too. AsSLX4 mutations are associated with the inability to produce blood cells, we assessed leukocyte differential counts in 379,385 controls and individuals who have lost or gainedcopies of BOLA2 -SLX1: 89 chromosome 16p11.2 deletion and 56 reciprocal duplication carriers from the UK Biobank. We found that the deletion is assoc iated with higher neutrophil (P=7e-6) and lower lymphocyte ( P=3e-3) counts. Upon stratication of the deletion carriers of our clinical cohort by BOLA2 -SLX1 copy number, we found an association between lowBOLA2 -SLX1 dosage and lymphocyte count < 1.5 M/ml of blood, as 4/7 carriers with three copies had this phenotype compared to 0/12 carriers with more than three copies(P=9e-3). We are currently measuring leucocyte differential counts in Slx1b -knockout mice. Our results show that the BOLA2 -SLX1 copy number in humans is positively associated with lymphocyte counts and its increase might improve our immune system. They pinpoint one loc us potentially involved in the lymphocyte count difference between humans and apes and highlight a potential dual adaptive role of BOLA2-SLX1 expansion in improving both iron meta- bolism and immune defense.

Miotla2, of Paediatric Haematology, Oncology Paediatrics, Lublin, Poland,4MedGen Medical Centre, Warszawa, Poland,5Departament of Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, 15q21.2 are known to cause spastic paraplegia 51 (SPG51). However, since only a few families affected by this mutation have been reported, the exact phenotype of SPG51 remains poorly character- ized. In addition, a previous study identi ed an autosomal dominant mutation in AP4E1 gene to be associated with persistent stuttering. The aim of the present study was to characterize the phenotype of a pediatric patient displaying signicant psychomotor retardation, intellectual disability and paraplegia. This phenotype was identi ed to be asso- ciated with a novel mutation in the AP4E1 gene, c.942_943 +3delinsCC. The pediatric patient showed severe delayed psychomotor development, impaired global physical development and general illness. Movement disorders were evident during the neonatal period. Moreover, magneticresonance imaging identi ed hypoplasia of the corpus cal- losum. The proband was tested by multiplex probe ampli cation and array comparative genomic hybridization. Subsequently, next generating sequencing (NGS) was performed in the patient, and Sanger sequencing was performed in his family members.

Therefore, cataloguingquantitative trait loci (QTLs) across tissues is a priority in complex disease genetics. In this study, we pro led alternative splicing and gene expression with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in colon tissue biopsies from a novel dataset of 445 healthy individuals. We found transcriptomic differences between colon anatomic locations and identi expression QTLs (eQTLs). These QTLswere enriched at regulatory elements and explained a proportion of genetic heritability not only for colorectal cancer and in flammatory bowel disease risk, but also for cognitive traits and psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease risk. We replicated the results using GTEx transverse colon data and made an interactive web resourceto explore the results ( http://barcuvaseq.org/ ).

Creating such catalogs for small variants from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is now commonly done for thousands of individuals collec-tively. We have transferred this joint calling idea from SNPs and indels to larger deletions and developed the rst joint calling tool, PopDel, that can detect and genotype deletionsin WGS data of tens of thousands of individuals simulta- neously as demonstrated by our evaluation on data of up to 49,962 human genomes. Good sensitivity, precision and thecorrectness of genotypes are demonstrated by extensive tests on simulated and real data and comparison to other state-of-the-art SV-callers. PopDel detects deletions in574 J. del PicchiaHG002 and NA12878 with high sensitivity as shown by the large overlap with different high-con dence reference call sets while maintaining a low false positive rate. On data of up to 6,794 trios, inheritance patterns are in concordance with Mendelian inheritance rules and exhibit a close to ideal transmission rate of 49.6%. PopDel reliably reports com-mon, rare as well as de novo deletions and the deletions reflect reported population structure. Meaningful quality measures and metrics of the variants like genotype quality,variant likelihood ratio and allele frequency within the cohort are reported along with the variants, enabling further downstream analysis. Therefore, PopDel enables routinescans for deletions in large-scale sequencing studies and we are currently in the process of implementing the detection of other SV-types. BMBF Grant #031L0180 S.

Antonarakis1 1University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland,2Ludwig Cancer Research Institute, San Diego, CA, United States, 3School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States The pathogenetic mechanisms of human trisomy 21 (T21) include the dosage effect of functional genomic elements on chr21, global dysregulation of gene expression and the individual genomic variability. In this study, we hypothe-size that the extra-copy of chr21 may change the chromatin 3D structure, which in turn may affect gene expression. We have used HiC experiments in 3 primary broblast cell lines from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21 (to eliminate the noise of the genome sequence variation). We have also used transcriptome, PMID, interactions (TADs) were observed signi cant differences in higher-order chromatin contacts, largely explained by differences in A/B compartmentalization. Remarkably, we have detected 83genomic regions (>1Mb) that change the compartment in T21 (from B to A, or A to B). These reorganized regions(ABt21) comprise a total of ~250 Mb of the genome. Genes within ABt21 regions display a dysregulated expression in T21: upregulated in the A, and downregulated in the B compartment. A substantial number of the ABt21 regions are constitutive annotated as LADs suggesting a partial repositioning of sequences at the nuclear envelopecomponents to the transcriptionally active compartment in T21. A fraction of the observed differences were also observed in comparisons between unrelated T21 andeuploid broblasts. In conclusion, we have identi ed mea- surable chromatin structure differences in T21 versus an euploid nucleus, that likely result in gene expression dif-ferences in T21. I. Kolpakov: None. C.

The introduction of theACMG guidelines set more stringent criteria, trying to standardize variant assessment in the clinical settings. However, this approach has universal applicability andtherefore requires signi cant expertise to be applied cor- rectly for speci c genes and diseases. Purpose: we highlight the potential role of the location of variants within the protein topology for ion channels genes, supporting variant interpretation process. Methods and Results: Data from 3580 probands, referred for LQTS genetic testing, was analyzed for KCNQ1 gene variants. In particular, the N-Terminal,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Interactive e-Posters 575Transmembrane linker pore region (TLP) and were used to assess the variant position. Subse- quently, four conservative helical regions, within the C- terminal, were incorporated in the analysis. The GnomAD population was used as a control. Our analysis revealed that missense variants localized in the TLP have the highestprobability for pathogenicity (expected predictive value (EPV)=98,4. Within the TLP, the pore and interlink domains showed the highest EPV, 100%, and 99.8 %respectively. Hence results con rmed the critical role of the four helical regions within the C- terminal. In particular, helix B and helix C provide an EPV of 100%, identifying acritical conserved region between Topological location of variants in the KCNQ1 gene can be used as a gene-speci c criterion for variant interpretation. Further studies stratifying the risk based on the variant location also in other ion channel genes could open new frontiers for the clinical application ofgenetic testing results. V. Novelli: None.

Local human genome standards serve asa reference, furthermore, the general ones help clinical geneticists to discern pathogenic mutations from benign polymorphisms. Materials and Methods: Samples were selected follow- ing strict criteria from Czech healthy blood donors. Next- generation sequencing was performed using the PCR-freewhole genome kit by sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (WGS). The genome variant calling was generated by the Dragen Bio-IT platform. Variantswere annotated using the Variant Effect Predictor version 99 and the bioinformatic pipeline was validated using the Genome in a Bottle standard. RSIDs were obtained from dbSNP build 153. Clinical relevance annotations were generated using ClinVar version 20200210. Results: 100 samples were sequenced with average read depth > 30X. The median of the total number of Ti/Tv ratio 1.9. Conclusions: WGS protocol including the bioinformatics analysis was created and validated to abide the EN ISO 15189 requirements. The variant analysis pipeline has beenveried and validated using the genome standard. The draft of the digital genome of the Czech population was created and will be expanded to up to 1,000 samples.

Here, we studied a family case with a mul-tiple abortion history and four affected members showing neurological defects. The index case is a three-year-old girl characterized by corpus callosum hypoplasia, bilateral cleftpalate, speech delay and facial dysmorphisms. The father, paternal aunt and grandmother showed partial corpus cal- losum hypoplasia, psychiatric disorder and short stature,respectively. By conventional we detected an unbalanced reciprocal translocation t(4;8)(p15.2;q12) seg- regating in the four individuals through three-generation.576 del PicchiaArray-CGH showed a 5,8 Mb duplication at 4p15.32-p15.2 in all the translocation carriers. In order to better char- acterize the chromosomal rearrangement, we performed a whole genome sequencing (WGS) 50x of the proband, father and grandmother. As a result, we revealed the hidden complexity of the translocation event classi ed as chro- moanasynthesis. Taking advantage from discordant reads and coverage depth, we detected six breakpoints clustered within 12,6Mb on 4p and 8q arms, duplications, deletionsand inversions, de ning the intricate genomic architecture of the translocation. All the breakpoints were con rmed by sanger sequencing, showing that only NKAIN3 is disruptedin its intron. NKAIN3 has not been associated with any known human disease, but its high expression in corpus callosum highlights the gene as a potential candidate for theneurological ndings.

P13.47.A Whole genome sequencing of unexplained inherited retinal disease cases Z. Fadaie 1, L. Whelan2, A. Dockery2, T. Medical Center, Nijmegen, Nether- lands,2The School of Genetics & Microbiology, Smur t Institute of Genetics, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland,3The Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion- Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel Purpose: Inherited retinal diseases are a major cause of visual impairment. This clinically heterogeneous disordersare caused by mutations in many genes. Nevertheless, 30- 40% of cases remain genetically unexplained. Therefore, we aimed to identify the genetic cause in unresolved casesthrough whole genome sequencing (WGS). Methods: After we performed WGS to identify thecausative variants in 100 unresolved cases. After initial prioritization, a focused in-depth prioritization took place of all deep-intronic variants and structural variants in geneswith candidate variants. In addition, functional analysis of the putative splice-site altering was assay. Results: We identi ed a genetic cause in 21 patients. Among others, causative coding variants were also observed in PDE6B andEYS. Moreover, in 49 monoallelic cases, we identi ed candidate variants based on the possible introduction of a cryptic splice site leading to a pseudoexon. For variants with a good genotype-phenotype correlation in- vitro splice assays were performed. Conclusions: We con rmed that WGS is a powerful tool to identify causative variants, when pre-screening methodsremain negative. This was most ef cient in cases with a distinct clinical diagnosis. We highlight the importance of the analysis of non-coding regions beyond the non-canonical splice-sites. We suggest that WGS provides the optimal detection method to enable a genetic diagnosis for unresolved cases.

J. 1p36 deletion syndrome - Iasi Regional Medical Genetics Centre 's Experience C. Rusu 1,2, and Pharmacy, Iasi, Romania,2\"Sf Maria\" Children 's Hospital, Regional Medical Genetics Centre, Iasi, Romania 1p36 deletion syndrome is a common subtelomeric micro- deletion (1/5,000 newborns), characterized by distinctivefacial features, hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, heart defects, hearing impairment, and prenatal onset growth de ciency. Although usually clinically recogniz- able, the syndrome has a considerable phenotypic variation. We present six cases identi ed using MLPA and/or Array- CGH in our center in order to illustrate particularities foundin our patients and correlate them with genotype. We identi ed 3 de novo interstitial 1p36 microdeletions of different sizes (2.48 Mb to 5.90 Mb) and 3 with reciprocalduplication (one patient with 4q35.1dup and two brothers with 14q32.33dup). All cases had a wide phenotypic spectrum. Most cases had perinatal distress and hypotonia.Constant features were severe intellectual disability and seizures. Even if straight eyebrows, deep-set eyes and pointed chin are considered highly suggestive for thediagnosis, they are present only in some of the cases. The particularities found in the \"pure\"1p36 microdeletionsAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Interactive e-Posters 577include: familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, pilonidal sinus, tall stature, obesity, rare eyebrows in external 1/3 (2 cases). The additional chromosomal anomalies present in 3 of the patients contribute to the phenotype severity, and additionally modify the clinical manifestations of 1p36 deletion. Analyzing the familial cases, we noticed that thesame chromosomal anomaly generates distinct phenotypes in the two brothers. In conclusion, we are presenting six cases with 1p36 microdeletion to discuss the frequency ofdenitory features and illustrate particularities. C. Rusu: None. R. Popescu: None. M. Panzaru: None. L.

Mackie Ogilvie2 1Genetics Laboratories, Guy 's Hospital, London, United Kingdom,2King 's College London, London, United King- dom Array CGH is widely used for the detection of chromosome imbalance in patients with congenital anomalies or neuro-developmental disorders. The signi cance of unique inter- stitial copy number imbalances detected by this technique is largely informed by the carrier status of the parents, who aregenerally tested by targeted array CGH. If neither parent carries the imbalance, further studies may be carried out using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to establish if either parent carries a balanced chromosome rearrange- ment. In the absence of such a rearrangement, their recur- rence risk approaches zero; however, a balancedrearrangement results in a 50% risk of imbalance in future pregnancies. Since 2008, our centre has tested approxi- mately 50,000 patients, with imbalances detected in ~22%;after parental array CGH testing 1,083 imbalances were not detected in either parent. Parents and probands of 203 non- LCR-mediated cases were tested using FISH probes tar-geted at the regions of imbalance. Deletions represented 175 of these cases, one of which was inherited from a parent with a balanced rearrangement (ins(1;11)). There were 28duplications, 27 of which were tandem, and the other inherited from a parent with a balanced rearrangement (ins (6;4)). The overall prevalence of parental balanced rear-rangements in these cases is therefore 2/203 (~1%). This gure is lower than that previously published, and may indicate that testing for these rearrangements may not benancially justi ed. Interestingly, we found no cases of de novo duplications caused by insertion of the duplicated region into a distant locus, indicating that this mutationalevent is rare.S. Bint: None. A.F. None. C.

Geneva, Switzerland Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is recommended pre- natally as a rst-tier investigation in case of abnormal f tal ultrasound. Following the identi cation of f tal anomalies, molecular diagnostic investigations using CMA will diag-nose a clinically signi cant subchromosomal copy number variation (CNV) in approximately 6% of pregnancies. We performed a retrospective study including 626 fetusesreferred to Genetic Medicine in Geneva Hospitals, Swit- zerland, between 2013 and 2019. The cohort consisted of 458 amniotic fluids and 168 chorionic villi. Referrals for abnormal ultrasound ndings were the most frequent indi- cation. Other indications were: high risk for trisomy in maternal serum screening or NIPT, advanced maternal ageand family history numerical or large structural rearrangements in a total of 32 cases (5%) and microdeletions/duplications associated to known syndromes in 16 foetuses (2,5%).Variants of unknown signi ed pregnancies (1,5%).Conventional karyotyping identi ed 2 additional aberrations with one de novo balanced translo-cation and one case of low trisomy 16 mosaicism. After years of experience, our center has developed a strong technical and clinical experience of CMA testing in prenataldiagnosis. This approach improves the yield of chromosome aberration detection for fetuses with abnormal ultrasound scans. In addition, karyotyping remains useful for themechanistic explanation of chromosome rearrangement and prevention of recurrence in some cases. S. Gimelli: None. E. Stathaki: None. V. Kremer: None. B.

R\u00f6pke , Y. GermanyWe report on a 17-month-old girl of nonconsanguineous parents. The pregnancy had occurred after intracytoplasmicsperm injection. The girl presented with dif culties of feeding, speech and motor delay, and unspeci c craniofacial dysmorphism. The was unremarkable. Array analysis discovered a het- erozygous deletion of approximately 156kb in 2p16.1, conrmed in the child and excluded in parents by quantitative PCR. This deletion encompasses exclusively the entire BCL11A gene. Sequence variations in BCL11A (MIM 606557) are associated with the autosomal-dominantDias-Logan syndrome (MIM 617101). Larger deletions including the BCL11A and neighboring genes were found in patients with the 2p16.1-p15 deletion syndrome (MIM612513). Both syndromes are characterized by develop- mental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, dys- morphic features and persistent fetal hemoglobin. Deletionsin 2p16.1 comprising only the BCL11A gene are rarely reported. Until now, only two patients with a BCL11A deletion were described. The patient described by Balciet al. (2015) showed brain malformations, developmental delay and distinctive facial features. Peter at al. (2014) reported a patient with hypotonia, delays in gross motorskills and a severe speech disorder. However, this patient had no cranial and skeletal anomalies, microcephaly or growth retardation. In summary, this is the third patientdescribed with entire but exclusively deletions of BCL11A . These patients demonstrate features of Dias-Logan syn- drome which broadly overlap with 2p16.1-p15 deletionsyndrome and support the assumption that BCL11A is the candidate gene of most ndings seen in patients with 2p16.1-p15 deletion.

P14.07.C A high detection rate for chromosomal microarray testing in 837 microcephaly cases .R. Sukenik-Halevy R. Tomashov Kahanaa, S. Yacobson, I. Agmon-Fishman, I. Maya Recanati Genetic Institute, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva,, Israel Introduction: Microcephaly is a deviation from normal head growth that may be the rst indication of an under- lying genetic syndrome. We aimed to assess the yield ofchromosomal microarray (CMA) testing for prenatally detected microcephaly as well as for postnatal cases. Materials and Methods: CMA testing was performed for 88 prenatally detected microcephaly cases and for 749 postnatal cases at a single lab. We assessed the yield of CMA in relation to speci c clinical characteristics. Results: Pathogenic and likely pathogenic (LP) results were detected in 4.6% of prenatal cases, signi cantly higher than the rate reported in low risk pregnancies (1.4%). Themale to female ratio in this cohort was 3. The yield was not affected by gender nor by any other clinical parameter. The yield for postnatal cases was 15% with a signi cantly higher detection rate for cases in which dysmorphism, hypotonia, epilepsy, congenital heart defects (CHD), learning disabilities (LD) and a history of intrauterinegrowth restriction (IUGR) were reported. There were no specic recurrent copy number variations (CNVs). The rate of variants of unknown signi cance was 3.94%. Conclusions: The yield of CMA testing is signi cant both for prenatal as well as for postnatal microcephaly cases.

P14.08.A The chromosomal microarray analysis of products of conception in pregnancy loss .Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 579E. G. 1Genetic Center \u00abGenomed\u00bb, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Russian medical Academy of continuing professional education of the Ministry of health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation,3Federal Uni- versity of Kazan, Kazan, Russian Federation,4Ural State Medical University, Yekaterinburg, Russian Federation Introduction: The miscarriage is an actual problem, that frequency is from 15-25% to 55%, reaching 80% in the rst trimester. The reccurent pregnancy loss (RPL) is observed in 2-5% of cases. Chromosomal abnormalities (CAs) are acommon cause of miscarriages and RPL. In 2014-2019 we performed 2201 analyses of POC to evaluate the prevalence and structure of chromosomal abnormalities. Materials and Methods: 2201 samples of DNA from POC were studied by the chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), using CytoScan Optima array (ThermoFisherScienti c, USA). Results: CAs were detected in 49.57% of cases, of which aneuploidy of one chromosome, including mosaic forms, weredetected in 72.69%, aneuploidy more, then one chromosome, including mosaic forms - 6.97%, triploidy - 10.72%, other CAs with possible clinical signi cance - 8.62% (of these - 15.95% were terminal deletions and duplications of non-homologous chromosomes, indicating a high probability of unbalanced translocation), tetraploidy - 1.01%. In 5.7% samples the size ofCAs was less, than the theoretical resolution of the karyotype analysis (10Mb), of which in 48.48% of cases, such CAs were found as part of complex CAs. Conclusions: Chromosomal abnormalities in POC can be cause of miscarriages and RPL and some complex rearrangements may present an increased risk for nextpregnancies. In our study CAs were detected in 49,57% POC samples. E.G. Panchenko: None. None. P14.11.A Incidence of constitutional chromosome aberrations in patients with hematological diseases M. Valerianova 1, Czech Republic,2Center Oncocytogenomics, Institute ofMedical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, Gen- eral University Hospital and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic,31st Medical Department, General University Hospital and First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic Introduction: Constitutional chromosome aberrations are usually a random nding (except of trisomy 21) in cyto- genetics examination of patients with hematological dis-eases. In retrospective study over the last 21 years, we followed the incidence of constitutional chromosome aberrations detected in connection with the diagnosis ofhematological malignancy and/or other hematological dis- order. We compared our data with the incidence of speci c chromosome aberrations in previously published studies. Materials and Methods: We analyzed karyotypes of bone marrow or peripheral blood cells in 23201 patients with myeloid or lymphoid disorders diagnosed in 1998-2019. Subsequently, we veri ed suspected constitutional chromosome abnormalities by examination of PHA stimu- lated peripheral blood lymphocytes. For karyotyping, weused conventional G-banding completed with molecular cytogenomics techniques. Patients with Down syndrome were evaluated as a special group. Results: In our cohort, we established constitutional chromosome aberrations in 92/23201 patients (0.4%). Auto- somal n= 17) occurred most often in a group of patients with autosomalanomalies. Sex chromosome aneuploidies were more frequent in patients with male phenotype ( phenotypes. Conclusions: The incidence of constitutional chromo- some aberrations in our cohort of patients with hematolo-gical diseases is corresponding to their frequency in population. Our results, similarly as other studies, indicate that the connection of hematological disorders and con-stitutional chromosome aberrations seems to be random, except of acute leukemia and constitutional trisomy 21.

P14.12.B Detailed cytogenetic analysis of a preconception adult male sample revealed clonal evolution and (probably)changed his Research in Biomedicine/Institute of Biomedical Sciences Abel Salazar of University of Porto(UMIB/ICBAS, Porto, that specialise in preconception analysis have traditionally included karyotyping among their routine genetic studies. If there is any particular clinical suspicion of a speci c disorder, other cytogenomic analyses may be offered. The authors present the case of an asymptomatic 32 year-old male with non-consanguineous parents from Eur- opean and African ancestry, who received preconceptiongenetic counselling at a medical genetics appointment. After having given his written informed consent for genetic testing, the patient was screened for carrier status for themost common variants of cystic brosis (CF) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), sickle cell anemia (SCA) and thalassemia, and balanced chromosomal anomalies by kar-yotype. No pathogenic variants were found on the CF and SMA screening and no anomalous results were found for SCA and thalassemia. However, in three independent cul-tures, the patient 's blood karyotype revealed a 46, XY line and another line with a translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, designated as Philadelphiachromosome, well-known to be associated with hematolo- gic malignancy. The karyotype was thus: 46,XY,t(9;22) (q34;q11.2)[6]/46,XY[33]. He was counselled for the testresults and a complete blood count was performed imme- diately showing an elevated white blood count with 2% blasts, thrombocytosis, and hemoglobin values on the lowerlimit of normal. He was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and initiated treatment with imatinib with a good clinical evolution. The authors enhance the fact that dis-closure of incidental ndings related with cancer in pre- conception genetic counselling was very relevant to clinical care in the case described. N.

P14.13.C When one CNV is not enough and array needs karyotype and to go FISHingB. Marques 1, S. Sera Lisboa, microarray analysis (CMA) allows the detection of microdeletions/microduplications at a higher resolution but nonetheless karyotype and FISH studies may be required to clarify the underlying mechanism andrecurrence risk of complex rearrangements. Here we present a 3-year-old girl with attention de cit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), speech disorder (SD), developmental delay (DD),and strabismus with a 3.6 Mb terminal loss at 9p24.3p24.2, a 433 Kb interstitial gain at 15q13.3, and a 3.3 Mb terminal gain at Xp22.33, uncovered by Affymetrix Cytoscan HDCMA. The 15q13.3 gain, inherited from the unaffected father, includes part of CHRNA7 and it\u00b4s a known region with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivityassociated to DD, SD, and ADHD, apparently tting to the patient phenotype. However, to assess a predicted unba- lanced t(X;9) karyotype and FISH were performed, both inthe patient and the parents, revealing a de novo 9p deletion show avariable phenotype which may include DD, SD, and stra- bismus, among others, features also described in our patient. The Xp gain has an unknown contribution for the overallphenotype. Trio SNP-array showed the der(9) to be of maternal origin and therefore a balanced t(X;9) with low level/gonadal mosaicism in the mother may exist and thusrecurrence risk is not completely excluded. This case shows of how CNVs may contribute cumulative to a phenotype and the importance of keeping both cytogenetics andcytogenomics present in a diagnostic setting as CMA may need clari cation by karyotype/FISH.

P14.14.A Diploid/triploid mosaicism in a child with normal developmentAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 581M. Odense, Denmark,2Department Dermatology and Allergy Centre, Odense University Hospital, Odense,Denmark, 3H.C. Andersen Children 's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark Introduction: Diploid/triploid mosaicism is a rare entity, where a triploid cell line is present with varying tissue distribution. Cognitive de cit of varying degree is reported in most published cases. Other frequently reported features are growth retardation, syndactyly or clinodactyly, hypo- tonia, truncal obesity, body or facial asymmetry and pig-mentary changes of the skin in the distribution of Blaschko 's lines. We present a case with diploid/triploid mosaicism in a girl with normal development and reviewreported cases of diploid/triploid mosaicism. Materials and Methods: and G-band karyotyping. Results: A 3,5-year old girl was referred for evaluation of irregular skin pigmentation following Blaschko 's lines. She was otherwise healthy with normal development. Karyotyp-ing of broblasts from hyperpigmented and normal skin, revealed mosaicism with a triploid cell line (69,XXX) in 39% and 24% respectively. CMA veri ed mosaicism in the hyperpigmented skin biopsy but failed to detect the low- grade mosaic in normal skin. A normal karyotype 46,XX was seen in blood. Conclusions: This case con rms, that diploid/triploid mosaicism can be seen in persons with normal develop- ment, representing one end of a broad phenotypic spectrum.Genetic testing is biased towards individuals with cognitive decit, and it is therefore likely that diploid/triploid mosaicism is underdiagnosed in patients with normaldevelopment. While triploid mosaicism was seen by karyotyping in hyperpigmented as well as normal skin, CMA failed to detect the triploid cell line in normal skin,conrming that karyotyping is still a valid and useful diagnostic method for pigmentary anomalies.

P14.15.B Genotoxicity induced in vitro by water soluble indoor 2.5fractions in relation to eight heavy metals concentrations E. Kogianni1, C. Samara1,T. S. Lialiaris2 1Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Dept of Chemistry, Thessaloniki, Greece,2Dekokritus University of Thrace,Medical School, Dept of Genetics, Alexandroupolis, Greece Introduction: Airborne particulate matter (PM) generally contains a large number of genotoxic substances. Heavy metals concentrations in water-soluble outdoor PM frac-tions have been found consistent with genotoxicity to a signicant degree, when no suf cient evidence exists for the indoor PM corresponding fractions. Materials and Methods: The genotoxicity induced by water extractable particulate matter PM 2.5selected from indoor air of 20 workplaces in Alexandroupolis (North-eastern Greece) was examined in relation to the concentra- tions of the heavy metals Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn, Cr and Cd. For the determination of genotoxicity, the SisterChromatid Exchange (SCE) induction assay was applied in human peripheral lymphocytes from healthy volunteer donors, whereas metals concentrations were determinedusing atomic absorption spectroscopy. Measurements took place in three water-soluble fractions: the total fraction WS A (ltered through 0.45 m), the dissolved fraction WS B (ltered through 0.22 m) and the non-chelexed dissolved fraction WS C(ltered through Chelex-100 resin). Results: Statistically signi cant genotoxicity has been induced by all three fractions in relation to the control. When the results have been air volume- and 2.5mass- normalized, the number of SCE 's decreases from WS Ato WS C, while the difference of SCE 's between WS Aand WS C is statistically signi cant in the air volume- normalized approach. Also, signi cant correlations between a number of metals and the induced genotoxicity resulted in all three fractions, which are weaker in the air volume- normalized approach. Conclusions: Heavy metal concentrations seem to play an important role to genotoxicity induced by water-soluble indoor 2.5fractions. E. Kogianni: None. None. None.

We investigated four groups of adult BALBc mice that received normal diet (groups NFI, NFII) or pork greaves (groups PGI, PGII) for 7 days. At the beginning of the 8thday mice from each group received a single intra- peritoneal injection with DOX (doses range: 1.7-7.7 mg/kg body weight) or isotonic saline solution. All were tested in quadruplicate. In 10th(groups NFI, PGI) and in the 14th(groups NFII, PGII) days from the beginning of the experiment the mice were euthanized and the chromosome aberrations were tested in bone marrow cells. We initialyassumed that the brutal shift of diet from normal food to pork greaves will have a big impact on mice weight, but the results have shown that DOX had a stronger impact cousingambrupt weight loss. After 3- or 7-days post-injection with low DOX doses the number of chromosomal aberrations was signi cantly increased when compared to control group (p< 0.05). From observed aberrations the frequencies of polyploidy and deletion were signi cantly higher in mice who received 5.7-7.1 mg/kg when compared to those trea-ted with lower doses. The clastogenic impact of DOX in bone marrow cells seem to not be in fluenced by alternative diet. R.M. Sionel: None. L. Berca: A.

Alexandru 1, \"Victor Babes \", Timisoara, Romania Introduction: Genotoxicity represents the damage done to DNA by ionizing radiation. This damage can lead to the formation of random mutations in somatic cells and sub- sequently to the formation of different types of neoplasia.We aim to: Study the association of environmental factors with the genotoxic effect of ionizing radiation.Material and Methods: We tested 64 doctors and nurses working in the Radiology and Radiotherapy departments using the micronucleus test. Along with the test, the medical personnel received a questionnaire regarding personal lifestyle choices as well as additional sources of exposure to genotoxic agents. Using the data received from thequestionnaire we attempted to establish correlations between speci c lifestyle choices and the results of the micronucleus test. Results: We looked at correlations between age, overall number of risk factors, individual risk factors, employment length and the number of micronuclei per 1000 lympho-cytes. Our results showed no signi cant correlation between the variables measured. Participants with risk factors such as smoking (40%), alcohol consumption (19%) and X-rayexposure in the last 5 years (58%) showed no measurable increase in the average number of micronuclei. Only participants that had undergone CT-scans in the last 5years (26%) showed an increased average of their micronucleus test (8.375 compared to the overall average of 5.7 ). Conclusions: The environment seems to play a negligible role in number of micronuclei, as a proxy for genotoxicity, however increased number of participants could bringadditional information. Exposure to CT scans was shown to be associated with genotoxicity. O. Alexandru: None. M. Alexandra: None. P. Laura: None. C. Adela: P. Maria: None.

Haack2, Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, T\u00fcbingen,Germany, 3Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany Interstitial duplications of chromosome region 11q12.1q13.1 are rare. We report on two siblings with intellectual disability in whom an interstitial de-novo- duplication of chromosome region 11q12.1q13.1 wasdetected. The 35-year-old female index patient had mild intellectual disability, but no malformations or other major health problems. Her 28-year-brother had moderate intel-lectual disability. Array-CGH analyses revealed an identical 7.83 Mb duplication in chromosome region 11q12.1q13.1 (genomic position according to hg19: chr11:57453530-65234091) in both patients. The duplication was con rmed by FISH analyses and whole-exome sequencing. TheAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 583duplication was present neither in the healthy parents nor in the healthy sister, suggesting germline mosaicism in one of the parents. The ndings in the family reported here indicate that duplications of chromosome region 11q12.1q13.1 are associated with mild to moderate intellectual disability, but not with major malformations or other severe health pro-blems. Reports of additional patients with overlapping duplications will be needed to elucidate the contribution of individual genes to the clinical phenotype. B. Gl\u00e4ser: None. K. Komlosi: None. T.

Pochiero3, Clinical Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florenc, Florence, Italy,2Medical Genetics Unit, Meyer Children 's University Hospital,, Florence, Italy,3Metabolic and Muscular Unit, Neuroscience Department, Meyer Children 's Hospital, Florence, Italy Here we describe the case of a male newborn of non con- sanguineous parents, born by cesarean section for intrau- terine growth retardation. In occasion of genetic evaluation,performed at age two years, we have ascertained hypospa- dias, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features with hyperCK-emia and highlevels of transaminases. Array-CGH analysis showed a de novo interstitial deletion of approximately 194 kilobases in the 5q31.3 region, which includes part of the KCTD16 gene, to date not associated with any speci c human dis- ease. KCTD16 is one of the auxillary subunits of the GABA-B receptor and has been demonstrated to in fluence neuronal excitability by regulating GABA-B receptor- mediated gating of postsynaptic ion channels. This subunit is highly expressed in many brain regions, includingamygdala and hippocampus, and regulates GABA-B receptors 'action neuronal excitability, oscillatory network activity and cognitive functions. Our report is the rstnding of an intragenic deletion of KCTD16 and we could speculate that hap- loinsuf ciency of this gene may have played a role in determining our patient 's neurodevelopmental phenotype. We plan to perform further molecular analyses (wholeexome sequencing) since we cannot rule out the neurolo- gical phenotype may be determined by biallelic variants ofthis gene. Furthermore, our patient 's phenotype could also be caused by other known disease-genes. We will then proceed with functional studies to verify the real association of this gene with a new syndrome.

P14.23.A Mosaic loss of chromosome Y is more prevalent in patients with prostate cancer T. Kobayashi 1, T. Hachiya2, K. Hino3, T. Ando3,M . School Medicine, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan, 2Department of Advanced Informatics for Genetic Disease, Juntendo University, Graduate School of Medicine, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan,3Genesis Healthcare Co., Ebisu, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo, Japan Introduction: Clinical utility of mosaic loss of chromo- some Y (mLOY) for cancer screening or for predictingcancer prognosis is controversial. We examined the pre- valence of mLOY in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: DNA microarray analysis was performed on saliva samples from 176 prostate cancer patients and 5402 control subjects. From the fluorescence intensity data of 2464 probes located at male-speci c region of chromosome Y, the median of log R ratio (mLRR-Y) was calculated, and subjects with mLRR-Y -0.15 was classi ed into the mLOY group. Age distribution was matched in prostate cancer and control groups, and the frequency of mLOY was compared. Furthermore, we investigated the association of mLOY with age at diagnosis,PSA value at diagnosis (iPSA), progression to castration- resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and treatment methods among prostate cancer patients. Results: Of the 165 cases in each of the age-matched groups, the number of subjects with mLOY was signi - cantly higher in prostate cancer compared to control (9 inprostate cancer and 0 in control; P-value=0.003). Among the prostate cancer patients, there were no signi cant differences in age at diagnosis, iPSA, and the proportion ofthe cases that progressed to CRPC. Regarding treatment methods, mLOY was not associated with surgery, but was signicantly associated with radiotherapy ( P-value = 0.021). Conclusions: mLOY occurs more frequently in patients with prostate cancer than in the control group. Amongprostate cancer patients, mLOY is more likely to occur in cases who have been treated with radiation.584 J. del PicchiaT. Kobayashi: None. T. Hachiya: A.

P14.25.C Mosaic Turner syndrome of maternal origin in a child resulting from a consanguineous marriage: approximately 1:2000 female live births. 45,X/47,XXX mosaicism is seen in only 1% of cases; often caused by early post-zygoticchromosomal non-disjunction in disomic cells. Abnormal folate metabolism, as a result of genetic polymorphisms, can result in chromosomal non-disjunction. The presentstudy evaluated the parental origin of non-disjunction and polymorphisms in genes involved in the folate metabolism in 45,X/47,XXX mosaic patient and their parents. Materials and Methods: Allelic segregation analysis for the STR marker located in the Retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) gene was performed using the genealogy revealed consanguineous union, rst cousins. The patient 's DNA sample exhibited a triallelicprole which two are of maternal origin (alleles 315bp and 319bp) and one of paternal origin (309bp allele). The analysis also indicated that 45,X cells maintain maternal X represented by the 319bp allele. the The presence of heterozygosity also was observed in her mother (MTHFRC667T, DHFRdel19pb and MTHFRA1298C) and in her father (MTRA66G,RFC1A80G and CBS844ins68 alleles were homozygous in the family trio. Conclusions: It is possible that the presence of allelic variants involved in the folate metabolism might have favored errors in chromosomal disjunction during maternal gametogenesis, resulting in Turner de \u00c9.C. P14.26.A A Case With Turner-Down S. H. C. Emeksiz2, A. Ozturk Kaymak3, A. Tukun3 1Medical Genetics Istanbul, Turkey,2Pediatric Endocri- nology Department, Medeniyet University Goztepe Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey,3Medical Genetics Department, Duzen Laboratories, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: We reported a patient with the mosaic form of Turner Syndrome and Down Syndrome, which is extre-mely rare. A 16-year-old girl was evaluated for her short stature and minor dysmorphic features. She has mild mental retardation, short stature and minor dysmorphic featureswith mild hypotelorism, mild epicanthic folds, long phil- retrognathy, mild low set ears, mild low posterior hairline, short neck, short fthngers, increased distance between the rst and second toes, skin syndactyly of second to third toes, bilateral proximal outlet of fourth toe. She has no gonadal dysgenesia and has regular men-strual periods. The patient 's pelvic and renal ultrasound and echocardiographic examinations were normal. She is the seventh child of 53 years old mother and 55 years oldfather. Materials and Methods: Cytogenetic analysis of per- ipheral blood samples by using G-banding revealedmosaicism with 2 cell lines (47,XX +21[16]/45,X[14]). FISH analysis revealed that 78.5% of the cells hadAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 585monosomy X karyotype and 21.5% of the cells had XX karyotype; trisomy 21 was detected in 7.4 % of the cells. Results: The cytogenetic analysis of the patient revealed mosaicism of Turner and Down syndrome. Her FISH analyses from urine and buccal swab con rmed that result. Her parental chromosome analyses were normal. Conclusions: The incidence of Turner / Down Syndrome is very rare. To date, less than 100 patients have been identi ed. We present this case to emphasize that classical cytogenetic analysis is still very important for the diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities S. Canbek: None. H.C. Emeksiz: None. A. None. P14.30.B Verication of balanced and unbalanced structural variants by optical genome mapping J. Schiller1, U. Heinrich1, CA, States,3Medical Practice for Genetic Counseling and Psychotherapy, Augsburg, Ger-many Conventional chromosome analysis is capable of detecting both copy number (CNV 's) and balanced structural variants (SV's), but only at a low resolution. Microarray analysis can detect CNV 's at a high resolution level, but is unable to detect copy neutral SV 's. To get a deeper insight in such variants and to narrow down the breakpoint regions, we started a veri cation study using 20 samples with known chromosome and microarray analysis results using Bionano Genomics 'optical mapping technology. Bionano Genomics offers a complete work flow solution from sample prepara- tion, DNA imaging and genomic data analysis enabling the identi cation of balanced and unbalanced SV 's. Ultrahigh- molecular-weight DNA (size 50kb to 1 Mb) was extracted from fresh human blood followed by a single direct-labeling enzymatic reaction to incorporate fluorophores at a speci c 6-basepair sequence motif, yielding approximately 15 labelsper 100 kb. The SAPHYR-Instrument loads samples into nanochannels linearizing the labeled sample DNA and visualizing the label pattern. An algorithm converts theimages into molecules and aligns molecules 'de novo 'to construct consensus genome maps. Cross-Mapping to a reference sequence enables an automated SV detection.In a runtime of about 24h, an effective coverage of approx. 318-381x (minimum required 80x for non-mosaic samples) was achieved with a total DNA (> =150 kb) output of 1300Gb and a map rate of 78-89%. We will discuss our results and demonstrate that this technology can be applied in a clinical diagnostic setting having the potential to replace conventional cytogenetics and microarray analysis. J.

Assotiation to ring chromosome M. Garc\u00eda2, Huelva, Spain Background Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PHMDS) is typically characterized by autism spectrum disorder, absentto severely delayed speech, and neonatal hypotonia. The PHMDS wide phenotypic variation is attributed partly to the type and size of 22q13 genomic deletion, partly toadditional unde ned factors. This deletion encompasses the SHANK3 gene which is thought to be the critical gene for the neurodevelopmental features. We report the cytogeneticand molecular characterization of a constitutional de novo ring chromosome 22 (r(22)) in a patient with autism and language disorders Methods GTG-banding karyotype wasperformed according to standard protocols. Twenty meta- phases chromosomes were examined with a 400-550 bands of resolution. Array-CGH analysis was performed by aCGX TMHD v1,1 4-plex array 180 k (PerkinElmer), with an average resolution of 40 kb in the backbone and 20kb in the regions of interest. Results Karyotype results were 46,XY,r(22)(p13q13.33). Array-CGH revealed a terminal deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22, involving region 22q13.33 with an estimated size of 734.84 Kb, includingSHANK3 gene; arr (GRCh19) 22q13.33(50,443,314- 51,178,149)x1. Conclusion The determination of the size of the deletion by aCGH is very useful for the association withdescribed syndromes associated with deletions or duplica- tions. However, the possibility that this deletion leads the formation of a ring chromosome can only be evaluated byperforming a karyotype which is also necessary to analyse the presence or absence of mosaicism respect to ring chromosome, and therefore, the clinical symptoms andevolution of the patient could have implications for genetic counselling.586 J. del PicchiaM.

Boughalem1, D. Trost1, A. the pleckstrin been associated with Chung-Jansen syndrome MIM # 617991. Only 9 patients with micro-deletions spanning the 6q14.1 region including the PHIP gene have been reported with a phenotype similar to Chung- Jansen syndrome. However, these patients have a number ofadditional clinical ndings, likely due to the deletion of adjacent genes in 6q14. Here, we report two interstitial deletions at 6q14.1 involving the PHIP gene, in two unre- lated patients with a common phenotype of developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, obesity and dysmorphic features. Methods and results: SNP-CGHanalysis using Affymetrix Cytoscan microdeletion at 6q14.1 (79,326,616_79,968,863 hg19) has been detected in the rst female patient presenting with obesity, developmental delay, behavioral and facial abnormalities. A smaller 54 kb intragenic microdeletion at 6q14.1, spanning part of exon 8-exon 24 of the PHIP gene (79687488_79741515 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient presenting with behavioral problems, developmental delay, dysmorphicfeatures. Her endocrine problems (other than obesity) included hypothyroidism, generalized hirsutism and pre- cocious puberty. Conclusions: To our knowledge the 54 kbdeletion is the smallest microdeletion described in this region by the use of SNP-CGH analysis. The patients we report here show clinical overlap with the phenotypicspectrum of previously reported in individuals with PHIP variants, which con rms that haploinsuf ciency of PHIP is sufcient to cause Chung-Jansen syndrome. This is the rst report of endocrine problems eg. Hirsutism, in Chung- Jansen syndrome. A. Boughalem: None. D. Trost: None. A. Bazin: None. C. Allioux: None. A. Lantres: None. P. Klein nger:None. S.

Serov2,4, Institute Genetics, Cytology and Genetics Novosibirsk, Russian Federation,3Siber- ian State Medical University, Tomsk, Federation, 4Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russian Fed- eration Introduction: Ring chromosomes are usually found as a part of mosaic karyotype and dynamic mosaicism is a fre- quent event in the patient 's cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) proved to be a valuable tool for the modelling of the dynamics of ring chromosome mosaicism through multiple cell divisions. Materials and Methods: We obtained 6 iPSC lines from skin broblasts of patient with 46,XY,r(8) and compared karyotypes of broblasts and iPSCs at different passages using G-banding, FISH and SNP-arrays. Results: Molecular karyotyping revealed that ring chromosome originated from an inverted duplication8p23.1-p11.22 with a terminal deletion at 8p23.3-p23.1. We found 85% broblasts with r(8) and 15% with monosomy 8, but later a clone of the cells with t(7;8)arose, that have gained a proliferative advantage with more than 80% of the cells after P20. iPSC karyotypes were similar with the initial broblasts in the early passages (90% of the cells had r(8) at P4), but later changes occurred in the line iTAF11-4: only 2% of the cells had the ring at P11 (100 cells were counted per passage). SNP-arrays revealed signsof chromothripsis in early passage and 46,XY P11 with an UPD(8)pat. Conclusions: Molecular and cytogenetic analyses allow to track the mitotic behavior of the ring chromosome in iPSCs culture. Spontaneous correction of the 46,XY,r(8) karyotype via uniparental disomy origin has been registeredin one of the 6 iPSC lines.

Lindstrand1,2 1Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden,2Department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 3Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet Science Park, Stockholm, Sweden,4Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Introduction: Ring chromosomes are rarely occurring cir- cularized chromatin which can arise during mitosis if sequences are lost. Structural variants (e.g. dele- tions) often accompany the formation of ring chromosomes,leading to neurodevelopmental disorders which severity strongly depends on the affected genes. However, the exact mechanism and biological effect of ring chromosomes isstill unknown. Here, we present RD_P26, a 6-year old girl presenting hemifacial microsomia, developmental and speech delay, and a ring chromosome 21, 46,XX,r(21)(p11.2q22.3). Methods: Characterization with templated and non-templated insertions in the BPJs. Remarkably, loss of genetic material,affecting 29% (70/242) of the protein-coding genes on chromosome 21, is not lethal. Moreover, the ring chromo- some is stable through multiple passages of neuroepithelialstem cells (NES), differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, we analysed the transcriptome of NES from RD-P26 and compared theexpression pro le to two trisomy 21 patients and three healthy controls. Results: 11.6% genes (2080/17831) were differentially expressed. Of the 171 genes located on chromosome 21, 24% (41/171) were differentially expressed. Within the three deleted segments, 19 genes were signi cantly down- regulated and there were no signi cant upregulations, consistent with haploinsuf ciency. Moreover, the down- regulated gene expression was mirrored by an elevated genedosage in the trisomy 21 patients. Conclusions: The hemizygous genes located within the deletions are considered as l ikely causing the patient 's phenotype, also other chromosomal rearrangementswere found.

P14.38.A Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany,2Department Erlangen- N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany Autosomal dominant missense or truncating mutations or deletions of sodium channel genes such as SCN1A, SCN2Aor SCN9A cause a broad spectrum of neonatal epileptic encephalopathies with variable clinical phenotypes. The sodium channel gene family clusters in 2q24.3, and dupli-cations of this region have been rarely described. All reported patients presented with severe, early-onset seizures and variable developmental and behavioral anomalies. We now report on a female newborn who presented from rst day of life with severe muscular hypotonia and prolonged focal cerebral seizures. Seizures were initiallytherapy refractory, but a high dose parenteral therapy with Phenytoin suppressed seizures almost completely, indicat- ing a mutation in SCN2A gene as possible cause. Trioexome sequencing, however, did not reveal a causative variant in SCN2A or other epilepsy-related genes. Chro- mosomal microarray analysis with an Affymetrix CytoScanHD Array revealed a copy number gain of 5,516 kb in 2q24.3q31.1 affecting 34 genes including the sodium channel gene cluster on 2q24.3. The proximal part of 0.5Mb containing SCN2A was present in four copies and the distal part of 5 Mb (containing SCN1A and SCN9A) in three copies. The aberration was con rmed, and a parental cryptic translocation was excluded by FISH analyses. We therefore consider this copy number gain in 2q24.3q31.1 to be disease-causing in our patient. To ourknowledge, this is the rst copy number gain in this region that includes a triplication of SCN2A. Tetrasomy of SCN2A might therefore contribute to the particularly severephenotype. M.

Chromosome analysis from cultured peripheral lymphocytes was performed, which showed an additional chromosomal material on the short arm of one chromosomes 22. For furthercharacterization of the chromosomal aberration, we performed array CGH analysis and detected an almost 25 Mb large terminal duplication 15q24.3q26.3. The combination of thesetwo methods showed a de-novo pure partial trisomy 15q with the karyotype 46,XX,der(22)t(15;22)(q24.3;p12). The Region 15q24.3-qter contains 151 proteins and is associated withovergrowth and developmental delay. In order to clarify the cause of the asymmetry, methylation-sensitive MLPA and qPCR was performed on mucosal cells of the left and right side.Triplicated copy number variation of 11p15.5 with unsuspicious methylation status was found in mucosal cells of the left side and is known for the growth retardation syndrome Silver-Russeland IMAGe. Subsequent quantitative PCR showed at least 20.8 Mb de-novo duplication 11p15.5p15.1. No mosaicism was found in mucosal cells of the right side. This case shows acomplex phenotype-genotype-correlation with coexistence of a germline and a somatic variant leading to hemihypertrophy and hemihypotrophy and may provide new insights of the precisehuman embryonic and fetal growth network.

P14.42.B Hi-C enables the 3D characterization of small super- numerary marker chromosomes J. Jungnitsch 1,2, for Medical Genetics and Human Genetics, Charit\u00e9 -University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 2Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Research Group Development and Disease, Berlin, Germany,3Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany For the last ve decades, small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) have been known to exist and are estimated to be present in ~3.3 million human individuals,while approximately a third of them are clinically affected. sSMCs comprise chromosomal parts, which occur addi- tionally to the physiological 46 chromosomes. These extrachromosomes appear in various morphological shapes, e.g. ring, inverted duplicated or centric minute chromosomes. Chromosome conformation capture technologies have thepotential to detect structural variants and advanced the interpretation of altered gene expression caused by them. Applying these novel technologies could give new insightsinto the emergence of sSMCs and their genotype-phenotype correlation. In this study we applied Hi-C in lymphoblastoid cell lines from four samples of individuals presentingdevelopmental delay carrying different sSMCs (1 ring, 1 inverted duplicated, 2 centric minute chromosomes). These samples were previously screened by FISH and aCGH. Inaddition we also performed RNA-seq to investigate dysre- gulation of genes included in the sSMC sequence, which when combined with Hi-C could uncover yet undiscoveredmechanisms (e.g. enhancer adoption). Strikingly, Hi-C was able to detect the sSMCs and the breakpoints at a higher resolution compared to karyotype and aCGH. Furthermore,Hi-C helped to reconstruct the 3D genome architecture of sSMCs compared to their physiological counterparts. We show that the Hi-C technology is able to contribute sub-stantially to the detailed characterization of sSMCs. Future studies will elaborate the cytogenetic and morphological characteristics further and eventually be able to explain andhopefully treat syndromes and phenotypes resulting from these chromosomal aberrations.

Liehr2, S. risk for phenotypic abnormalities of patients carrying an sSMC depends on several factors as tissue speci c mosaicism, the number of additional dosageAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 589sensitive genes, and/or the possibility of impaired imprint- ing due to the origin of the supernumerary chromosomal material. Especially, a valid genotype/phenotype correlation is very dif cult in patients with sSMCs originating from different parts of multiple chromosomes, because complex sSMCs can multiply all these effects. We report on a 39-year-old patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, infertility, small testicles, obesity, gynecomastia, hyper- thyroidism, sSMC. Methods: The patient\u00b4s lymphocytes and DNA from peripheral blood cells were analyzed by conventionalchromosome analysis (GTG banding) hybridization (FISH) of mosaicism. Therefore, the sSMC originates at least from 6 different parts of 5 chromosomes. After microdissection ofthe sSMC and reverse FISH, the localization of the DNA gains on the respective chromosomes could be con rmed. Around 50% of peripheral blood (mesoderm) and buccalmucosa cells (ectoderm) contained the sSMC. Conclusions: Complex sSMCs are very rare and the formation mechanisms of such complex structural con-stellations are still unclear, but chromothripsis-like pro- cesses could be considered. To best of our knowledge, our patient is the rst one reported, carrying a sSMC with such a high complexity. A. Weber: None. T. Liehr: None. S. Bilgen: None. M. Stumm: None. P14.44.A An unusual case of CLL with cytogenetical t(11;14) but two different IGH/CCND1 Dresden, Germany,2Onkologisches und St. Barbara, Halle, Germany The translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) occurs mainly in MCL, but is also found in a wide range of other B-cell lymphoma. We report about a case of a 58 year old male patient with suspected CLL and t(11;14)(q13;q32), detected by chro-mosome banding analysis (CBA). Additional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the IGH and CCND1 loci (dual fusion probe) unexpectedly revealed two independentclones: One clone (1; 60%) harbored the fusion signal constellation the standard translocation t(11;14)(q13; q32) with corresponding IGH/CCND1 colocalization on derivative chromosomes (der) 11 and 14, respectively. The other clone (2; 40%) showed a variant translocation pathognomonically relevant IGH/CCND1 colocalization on der(11), but no fusion signal on der(14). Instead, the 3 'CCND1 signal was found on an F- group-chromosome. Further FISH-analysis revealed theinvolvement of one chromosome 19 with isolated translo- cation of the 3 'CCND1 region from 11q to 19p. Both clones 1 and 2 cannot be distinguished by CBA at 300 band levels.We suspect that the variant IGH/CCND1 rearrangement led to a fusion of 3 'CCND1 and FSTL3 (follistatin-like-3) on chromosome 19, but due to the lack of commerciallyavailable FISH probes for this region this assumption could not be veri ed. The respective translocation t(11;19)(q13; p13) [CCND1/FSTL3] constitutes a very rare event with todate only one CLL case described. Impact on prognosis is unclear. As a conclusion, we recommend additional FISH analysis of the IGH and CCND1 loci in every case ofcytogenetically assured t(11;14), in order to preclude cryptic variant rearrangements and to ensure proper disease monitoring.

Hoefsloot Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands In our laboratory we perform routine SNP array analysis for several clinical phenotypes, including intellectual disability, congenital abnormalities, and prenatal indications. Although this technique is not primarily aimed for UPD(Uniparental Disomy) diagnostics, a patient with a maternal UPD of chromosome 20 was discovered. UPD as a con- sequence of heterodisomy is not detectable by SNP arrayanalysis. However, the presence of (large) homozygous regions on a single chromosome can be suggestive for an isodisomy UPD, which can be further tested for withanother technique. Here, we present a case of an infant with severe feeding dif culties needing gastric-tube feeding. Routine SNP array analysis did not show any particularities,except two terminal regions of homozygosity, at 20p and 20q, which is suggestive for UPD. To con rm the possible presence of UPD, we requested parental samples and590 J. del Picchiaperformed a trio-analysis. SNP trio-analysis indeed conrmed the presence of UPD20, which showed of a maternal origin. Maternal UPD20, or upd(20)mat syn- drome, is a very rare condition for which only a very limited number of cases are described in literature. The main symptoms of this disorder are prenatal and postnatal growthretardation and (severe) feeding dif culties requiring gastric-tube feeding in the rst years of life. Literature of the upd(20)mat syndrome and mechanisms leading to UPDformation are reviewed. E. Blom: None. J.J. in form of an Robertson Translocation der(14;14) in a child with skeletal abnormalities is a rare chromosomal disorder. Full trisomy 14 is often reported in abortion. Features in affected individuals with mosaic trisomy 14 can vary. Symptoms that have been most commonly reportedinclude intrauterine growth restriction, failure to thrive, developmental delay, asymmetric growth, abnormal skin pigmentation, distinctive facial characteristics and structuralmalformations. Case Report: A 6-month-old female was referred for genetic counselling because of short femora and humeri.The girl showed additionally a prominent forehead but no developmental delay and a normal skin at this point. In pregnancy intrauterine growth retardation was noted. Non-invasive prenatal testing for chromosome 13, 18, 21 and gonosomes showed no abnormalities. No further examina- tions from parents were desired. Results: Because of described skeletal anomalies and facial dysmorphism molecular diagnostic of FGFR3 was performed and no mutation was found. Chromosomeanalysis of peripheral blood revealed a mosaic trisomy 14 in form of a Robertson translocation 46,XX, +14,der(14;14) in 12% of 37nuclei from buccal mucosa showed three copies in 5% of cells. To exclude an uniparental disomy 14 we performed an STR marker analysis. No upd(14) was detected.Chromosome analysis of both parents were normal. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the rst report of trisomy 14 mosaicism in form of a Robertson translocation.Our patient with intrauterine growth retardation matched with many patients described in literature.

P15 New of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, 2Institute Molecular and Cell Biology, University Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,3Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Paris, France,4APE of Biology, University of Padova, Padua, Italy Generative models have shown breakthroughs in a wide spectrum of domains due to recent advancements in machine learning algorithms and increased computational power. Despite these impressive achievements, ability ofgenerative models to create realistic synthetic data is still under-exploited in genetics and absent from population genetics. Yet a known limitation of this eld is the reduced access to many genetic databases due to concerns about violations of individual privacy, although they would pro- vide a rich resource for data mining and integration towardsadvancing genetic studies. In this study, we demonstrated that deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) can be trained tolearn the high dimensional distributions of real genomic datasets and generate novel high-quality arti cial genomes (AGs) with none to little privacy loss. We show that our generated AGs replicate characteristics of the source dataset such as allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium, pairwise haplotype distances and populationstructure. Moreover, they can also inherit complex features such as signals of selection and genotype-phenotype associations. To illustrate the promising outcomes of ourmethod, we showed that imputation quality for low frequency alleles can be improved by augmenting reference panels with AGs and that the RBM latent space provides arelevant encoding of the data, hence allowing further exploration of the reference dataset and features for solving supervised tasks. Generative models and AGs have the potential to become valuable assets in genetic studies by providing a rich yet compact representation of existing genomes and high-quality anonymous substitutes for private databases.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 591B.

In 2 chromothripsis patients pre- senting with syndromic intellectual disability, and without candidate gene accounting for their clinical presentationafter short-read genome sequencing (30X srGS) analysis, we performed de assembly using 20X SMRT (Sequel 1 system - Paci c Bioscience) with the aim to reconstruct the map of derivative chromosomes. We utilized two assembly tools (Falcon, Canu) and took advantage of available short-read Illumina reads to correctsequencing errors originated from long reads (polishing steps). Contigs containing at least one breakpoint were mapped against the Genome Reference Consortium HumanBuild 37 (GRCh37/hg19) using Blast in order to calculate the percentage of identity. On average, Falcon allowed to obtain 111 contigs with 98,84% (SD 0.070) identity whereas 81 contigs with 98,92% (SD 0.001) identity were obtained with Canu. The average size of the chromosomal blocks contained inthese contigs were 206kb (SD 104kb) for Falcon and 185kb (SD 11kb) for Canu. In conclusion our bioinformatic method allowed us to precisely reconstruct the sequence of their derived chromo- somes, highlighting genomic events concerning chromo- somes 4, 11, 13, 14, 15, 21 for the rst patient and 3, 10, 12 for the second patient. Overall the combination of srGS and lrGS permitted to resolve complex chromosomal rearrange- ments, not otherwise achievable by srGS alone. S. verdez: None. Y. Duffourd: None. E. Tisserant: None. A.

Zhou, S. Mac, S. Tin, C. Caneda, J. Kirkland, A. Schmitt Arima Genomics, Inc., San Diego, CA, United States Three-dimensional genome organization is critical for gen- ome function. Hi-C technology has enabled high throughput analyses of chromatin conformation, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of chromatin folding and generegulation. However, conventional Hi-C methods can suffer from laborious work flows, sub-optimal analytical sensitivity and reproducibility, and prohibitively expensive sequencingrequirements. Realizing these challenges, Arima developed a 6-hour Hi-C protocol that improves analytical sensitivity through rapid, reproducible, multiple restriction enzyme Hi-C chemistry. This improved Hi-C chemistry detects more loops from signi cantly reduced sequencing depth. For example, Arima-HiC identi ed >12,500 loops in GM12878 cells from just 600 million raw reads. New technologies are being built on the Arima-HiC platform. For instance, Arima developed an optimized low-input protocol proven to detect >10,000 loops from 50,000 cells. Additionally, targeted genome conformation assays such as HiChIP and HiChIP data demonstrate repro- ducible detection of long-range gene regulatory interactions at a fraction of the cost as genome-wide Hi-C. Moreover,Capture-HiC enables discovery of chromatin loops around oncogenes and tumor suppressors at 500bp resolution, from only ~10M reads per genetic locus. Lastly, Arima-HiC datais emerging as powerful tool for genome-wide of592 J. del Picchiastructural variants (SVs) in cancer genomes. Analysis of a human GIST revealed >70 SVs, with several of these forming \"neo-TADs \", bringing genes (or fusion genes) into new regulatory environments potentiating mis-regulation and enhancer hijacking. Overall, Arima-HiC aims to be a flexible protocol for multiple \"C\"assays (Hi-C, HiChIP, Capture-HiC) that will accelerate research across human genetics and epigenetics. J. Belton: A.

Methods: RNA (lncRNA), and small RNAssimultaneously, and validated it by applying it to plasma and amniotic fluid samples. Results: By comparing the involvement and non- involvement of the steps of T4 PNK treatment and targeted RNA depletion, we showed that PALM-Seq could simulta- neously capture ef ciently redundant RNAs, with comparable performances of existing cell-free mRNA or small RNA sequencing methods. Describing cfRNAs inplasma and amniotic fluid with PALM-Seq revealed distinct RNA composition and similarly featured 3 'ends of mRNAand lncRNA. Furthermore, we identi ed a group of mRNAs, lncRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma that could perfectly distinguish pregnant and non- pregnant women. Conclusions: Altogether, PALM-Seq enables compre- hensive characterization of cell-free coding and non-codingRNAs, which could stimulate further progress in biomarker discovery, health status monitoring, and intercellular communication research.

P15.09.A Integration of genome-wide methylation with transcription analysis and genome sequencing enablesmolecular con rmation in a patient with CHARGE syndrome J. L. Granadillo , D. J. Wegner, M. Willing, K. Sisco, J. Wambach, D. Baldridge, F. S. Cole Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO, United States Introduction: CHD7 pathogenic variants cause more than 90% of CHARGE syndrome cases, an autosomal dominant condition characterized by coloboma of the iris, retina, and/or optic disk; choanal atresia, cranial nerve dysfunction, characteristic CHARGE syndrome ear malformations, developmental delay, congenital cardiac defects, and poorgrowth. Approximately 10% of cases have no known genetic cause. Materials and Methods: We report the case of a patient with clinical features of CHARGE syndrome and non- diagnostic genetic testing, including chromosome micro- array, CHD7 sequencing deletion/duplication analysis, SEMA3E sequencing, Sequencing. After enrollment in the NIH-funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), a comprehensive clinical assessment,genome-wide methylation analysis (GMA), Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), and CHD7 RNA studies were performed. Results: The proband is a Hispanic 5-year-old male with global developmental delay, bilateral optic nerve coloboma, nystagmus, penis, and cryptorchidism. Physical exam was notable for aAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 593squared face and CHARGE-like ears. CT bones revealed cochlear and vestibular malforma- tions, hypoplastic facial nerves, and revealed a CHD7 netic signature. WGS with focused bioinformatic analysis ofCHD7 and removal of all variant lters detected a de novo 15 bp deletion in intron 4 of CHD7 , denoted c.2239- 20_2239-6delGTCTTGGGTTTTTGT (NM_017780.3). RNA studies con rmed this deletion causes disruption of the canonical 3 'splice site, and introduction of a premature stop codon.

Frey, S. Meyer Department of Molecular Diagnostics and Cytometry, Blood Transfusion Service Zurich, Swiss Red Cross,Schlieren, Switzerland Introduction: Monitoring of chimerism in patients after stem-cell transplantation is part of the surveillance of impending clinical relapse. We previously established a method for monitoring based on detection of SNVs byTaqmanassays on a chip-digital PCR (chdPCR) platform (Thermo sher). This method enabled reliable monitoring on nearly 2,000 samples. However, substantial hands-on-timerenders this platform less suitable for high sample throughput. We aimed to establish an alternative system to our approved chdPCR platform providing higher samplethroughput and minimal hands-on-time. Material and Methods: The Opal dPCR chip represents the larger unit of the Naica crystal dPCR system (Stilla) and allows SNV detection in approximately 20,000 droplets. Crystal dPCR combines automated droplet formation and thermocycling on a single device (Naica Geode). Fluorescence signal of each droplet is measured in the Naica Prism instrument. With 48 reactions per run, the system represents a fast and economical alternative toother platforms. Results: Articial DNA mixes provided reproducible quanti cation of the minor allele, even below 0.25%. Notably, the clinically required 0.5% minor allele sensitiv- ity was achieved with only 5ng of input DNA. Additionally,the reliability of the crystal dPCR platform was con rmed on previously monitored patient 's samples and numerous EQA samples. Conclusions: This new generation of dPCR is fully compatible with our established SNV-based chimerism monitoring and has been proven to be fast, convenient andhighly accurate. In addition to minimal hands-on-time, and consumable use, the low amount of input DNA per reaction should be emphasized, opening the option of lineage specic chimerism monitoring. E. Gourri: None.

P15.13.B CNV analysis based on whole genome sequencing Simkova1, J. 1First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic,2Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic The samples from 100 healthy non-related individuals from Czech population were used for whole genome sequencing (WGS) on NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) biallelic structural variants (CNV, SVs) existing in thispopulation. After careful data ltering, the sets of well characterized individual variants were used for, nger- printing \"and relatedness determination. 35 000 SVs were detected in the Czech population, 8969 structural variants (SVs) per individual on average (median 9389). The num- ber of detected SVs per individual is highly dependent onthe mean coverage value. The suf cient coverage to capture all SVs in the sample should be signi cantly higher than the conventionally used value equal to 30. To test the genomewide analysis of SVs for relatedness determination, we used WGS data from 10 individuals belonging to a three- generation family. For the relationship category prediction,the following coef cients were Lxy, Li, Ioiselle, wang, wang. n. The distributions of values of all these coefcients for different relationships were computed rst using all detected variants as markers. Then the variants not having exactly identical genomic positions within all sam-ples were removed. We demonstrated that WGS in asso- ciation with appropriate bioinformatic tools is highly effective for SVs detection, the determination of their extentand population frequency. Our approach may lead to the successful determination of coef cients of relationships also for pairs with r =0.125. Supported by the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic grant no.

Schepers University of Antwerp, Antwerpen, Belgium Introduction: The similarity between the human and the zebra sh cardiac action potentials makes zebra sh an attractive model for cardiogenetic disorders. However, introducing base pair substitutions (knock in, KI) by theCRISPR/Cas9 technique in zebra sh remains challenging. In our efforts to generate a KI zebra sh model of the human CACNA1c c.2570C>G long QT syndrome mutation, we have combined early genotyping with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to improve the KI ef Methods: Zebra sh eggs were injected gRNA and four ( or complementary ( \"non-target \") to the gRNA binding sequence, symmetric or asymmetric. KIdetection was performed by NGS on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). To select embryos for breeding, DNA was extracted from live embryos with the Zebra sh Embryo Genotyping device. Results: Variable KI rates were observed, ranging from 0.1 to 1.58%. The highest KI rate was observed with Cas9mRNA with 1 gRNA and the right asymmetric target ssODN. Embryos from the Cas9 mRNA injection group containing >0.2% KI reads were raised to maturity andcrossed out to assess germline transmission. One out of 10 sh passed the edited allele on to 25% of its offspring. Conclusions: KI experiments in zebra sh show a high degree of variability. The KI ef ciency tends to be lower in disease modeling than in methodological studies as the experiments are more restrictive. We intend to overcomethese limitations by combining early genotyping with an NGS detection technique. Grants: This research is supported by the Fund for Scienti c Research, Flanders. E.

P15.16.BValidation of INNO-LiPA CFTR iage for prenatal diagnostic Deelen1, J. Vanden Broecke2, Tremmerie3,M. Wilke1 Belgium,3Fujirebio Eurpe NV, Ghent, Belgium Cystic (CF) is a genetic disorder caused aberrant variants in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator(CFTR ) gene. For a full diagnosis of CF multiple tests are needed, among which genetic testing is one of the most important. During the rst round of genetic testing different tests are performed covering most frequent pathogenic variants (>1 %). Fujirebio Europe N.V. 's newly available commercial test INNO-LiPA CFTR iage was launched for identi cation of 88 known pathogenic variants in the CFTR gene in whole blood, dried blood spots and buccal brushes. Here we describe the validation of the INNO-LiPACFTR CFTR Deletions +6/CFTR Italian were used for detection of variants in aprenatal setting. 34 (prenatal) samples were investigated for the validation of INNO-LiPA CFTR iage. The test set con- sisted of earlier identi ed pathogenic variants derived from four chorionic villi samples (CVS, one normal, three mutated), 28 amniotic fluid samples (AF, 25 normal, 3 mutated), one Intra Uterine Foetal Death (IUFD) sample(normal) and one non-prenatal control. The experiments were performed at the department of Clinical Genetics (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, NL). The automatic read out wasperformed by Fujirebio Europe N.V. Results were com- pared with earlier obtained data. 34/34 were identical (one sample needed to be diluted 1/10).We tested a limitednumber of prenatal samples. All gave the expected result. Therefore we think that INNO-LiPA CFTR iage is suitable for detection of pathogenic variants in a prenatal settingusing DNA derived from CVS and AF. P. Reichgelt: None. R. van de Graaf: None. W.

Verma , El Segundo, CA, United StatesHigh-density SNP array, with its ability to detect regions of homozygosity and copy number variants (CNVs), is now themost commonly used platform for cytogenetic testing. Next- generation sequencing (NGS), traditionally used for detection of small base-level genomic changes, is now gaining wideracceptance as a platform for detecting CNVs in addition to single nucleotide variants (SNVs). With the reduction in cost of (WGS), many labs are con-sidering using \"shallow \"WGS to replace microarrays for cytogenetic testing. To assess content and design of micro- arrays, we performed analytical analyses on ten commonlyused SNP array platforms for cytogenetic testing offered by Illumina and Thermo Fisher/Affymetrix. The set of arrays included the Global Screening Array (GSA) and the GlobalDiversity Array (GDA) platforms from Illumina since they offer a very low-cost option. The analyses included number and coverage statistics on heterozygous probe distribution fordetection of AOH events, probes spanning exons/genes, and distribution of probes genome-wide covering regions with clinical signi cance from sources such as ClinGen, OMIM, DDG2P, and including a number of additional genes strongly associated with constitutional and oncology testing. Here we will share the results of the array comparison project as theycompare with each other and with shallow WGS, both in terms of coverage as well as cost. S. Verma: A.

Star1, DNA Redwood City, CA, United States,2Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.,Coralville, IA, United States Comprehensive tumor pro ling using NGS is fundamen- tally transforming oncology research. However, converting archival tissue samples into libraries is often challenging due to the low quantity and quality of DNA. Here wepresent accurate detection of variants in the human exome using the novel chemistry of the xGen Prism DNA library preparation kit, optimized for low-input and degradedsamples, with xGen Research Exome v2.0 hybrid-capture enrichment. The IDT Exome v2 panel was used to carry out targeted sequencing of Prism DNA libraries generated fromarchival FFPE samples. The unique library preparation is enabled by an engineered mutant ligase and proprietary adapters that prevent chimeras and suppress dimer-forma-tion, thereby maximizing the conversion of input DNA to sequencing libraries. We achieved high yields of library (300-400 ng) from input amounts as low as 25 ng forseverely damaged FFPE samples (DIN 1-3), >90% on- target rates and uniform depth of coverage (>96% bases covered at >20X and >98% bases covered at >10X) forFFPE samples across a wide range in quality. We also observed minimal exon drop-outs in dif cult-to-target genes for severely damaged FFPE material. To validate the variantcalling performance of the Prism-Exome work flow, we used the Horizon OncoSpan FFPE reference control which con- tains This study demonstrates that xGen Exome Research v2, when combined with xGen Prism DNA library preparation, pro-vides researchers with a complete human exome FFPE- sequencing solution with robust performance across FFPE samples of varying quality.

Dingemans1, D. E. Stremmelaar1, R. Van der Donk1, L. E. L. M. Vissers1, D. A. Koolen1, P. Rump2,J .Y Introduction: The Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdVS) is a multisystem syndrome with variable facial features caused by a 17q21.31 microdeletion or KANSL1 truncat- ing mutation. As the facial of KdVS is similar tothe gestalt of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), we assessed whether our previously described hybrid quantitative facial phenotyping algo-rithm could distinguish between these two syndromes, and, in addition, whether there is a facial difference between the molecular KdVS subtypes. Materials and Methods: We applied our algorithm to 2D photographs of 97 patients with KdVS (78 microdeletions, 19 truncating mutations) and 48 patients with 22q11.2DS aswell as age, gender and ethnicity matched controls with intellectual disability ( n=145). Results: The facial gestalts of KdVS and 22q11.2DS are both recognizable, yet different from one another ( p= 7.5*10 10andp=0.0052, respectively). ( p=0.981 and p=0.130). Further application to 3 patients with a variant of unknown clinical signicance in KANSL1 showed that these do not match a clinical diagnosis of KdVS. Conclusions: Our data highlight quantitative facial phenotyping not only as a powerful tool to distinguishsyndromes with overlapping facial dysmorphisms but also to establish pathogenicity of variants of unknown clinical signicance.

B. Sadowski, A. R. Hastie, M. Oldakowski Bionano Genomics, San Diego, CA, United States Repeat expansions and contractions are associated with degenerative disorders such as facioscapulohumeral mus- cular dystrophy (FSHD). The phenotype severity is often correlated with the extent of pathogenic expansion or con-traction. Inherently, these repeats are unstable. The repeat size in somatic cells can vary over time and be hetero- geneous, which impacts the age of onset in both the currentand successive generations. Most repeat disorders have no direct treatments. Southern blotting is the current gold standard for analyzing pathogenic repeats. While sequencing-based methods are being developed, these efforts are hampered by limitations in read lengths and the repetitive andpolymorphic nature of these regions. Optical mapping with Bionano Genome Imaging enables analysis of ultra-high molecular weight DNA molecules that can span largerepeats. In addition, a comprehensive streamlined work flow inclusive of sample preparation, DNA imaging, and genomic data analysis has been developed for high-throughput analysis of repeats of interest. We recently demonstrated the utility of the platform by focusing on the D4Z4 repeat contraction on chromosome4q35, which is a marker of FSHD when present on a permissive haplotype. The analysis had high sensitivity, specicity, and reproducibility. We analyzed 30 FSHD- positive samples. 28 of them had repeat contractions on the 4qA haplotype. The two samples that did not show repeat contractions were run twice; the results were consistent. We a-Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 597lso analyzed 58 FSHD-negative samples; none had repeat counts in the clear pathogenic range.

P15.23.C Global Screening Array as a First Line Test for Mutation Detection in Familial Hypercholesterolaemia F. Anderson 1, J. Berg2, S. Srinivasan2, C. Palmer2 1Dundee School of Medical, Dundee, United Kingdom, School of Medicine, Dundee, United Kingdom Background: Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common dominant disorder caused by mutations inLDLR ,PCSK9 orAPOB . Mutation analysis allows early detection and treatment of at risk individuals, preventing cardiovascular morbidity. In Scotland, despite availability of testing to anyone ful lling Simon Broome Criteria, it is estimated that 80% of individuals remain undiagnosed. Use of a screening array of known mutations has the potential to detect actionable mutations more cheaply, allowing testingof many more individuals and improving detection of pathogenic variants in the population.Method and Results: We evaluated the potential clinical utility of an array based approach to mutation analysis for FH. In NHS Tayside, between 2010 and 2018, 37 pathogenic variants and 8 variants of uncertain signi cance were identi ed in LDLR in 75 individuals. We compared these to the manifest of the 2016 Illumina In nium Global Screening Array-24 V2.0, containing 1077 mutations implicated in FH. All 26 of the pathogenic point mutations were present on the array, and 10/11 of the deletions hadoverlapping SNVs present- giving a potential of actionable 6/8 (75%) of variants of uncertain signi cance were also represented. Conclusions: We conclude that array technology for DNA mutation analysis has potential for screening for FH mutations in clinical practice. with the possibility ofdesigning different clinical models for case identi cation. With careful optimisation of this low cost test option, a much greater proportion of mutation carriers could beidenti ed and treated, with signi cant impact on cardiovas- cular disease in the population.

Hsue1, .K u2 1Agilent Technologies, la jolla, CA, United States,2Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States Accurate low allele frequency variant calling by next gen- eration sequencing (NGS) can be challenging with FFPE specimens and circulating tumor DNA due to limited DNA availability, poor DNA quality, and variation in tumorfraction from sample to sample. Other practical considera- tions such as turnaround time, multiplexing capability and workflow simplicity or technological limitations such as index cross-contamination and index hopping with newer Illumina sequencing chemistries can also in fluence how readily NGS is applied to clinical tumor samples. Here weaddress these challenges by developing a complete but flexible work flow solution which is optimized for a wide range of DNA input (10-200 ng), various sample types(intact or FFPE samples), different shearing methods (mechanical vs. enzymatic), sequencing chemistries (2 \u00d7 100 bp or 2 \u00d7 150 bp), 90-minute or overnight bait hybri-dization, and up to 384 unique dual sample indices to eliminate index hopping. Furthermore, we incorporate598 J. del Picchiaduplex molecular barcodes at the ligation step to lter out PCR errors by making consensus calls using MBC infor- mation from both strands (duplex MBC), hybrid (duplex MBC where info is available), single strand (single MBC) or discard MBC information (no MBC), based on the application.

An variants including recombinations with the pseudogene Israel Pathogenic biallelic alterations in GBA cause Gaucher dis- ease, while monoallelic alterations represent a risk factor for Parkinson 's disease. The mutational spectrum consists of single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions as well as of recombination-mediated rearrangements with the nearby pseudogene GBAP . The latter type of alteration has been dif cult to detect and characterize by the standard GBA diagnostic approaches due to the application of an initial GBA -speci c long-range PCR. We developed a capture-based NGS protocol and a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline that exploits the relative number of aligned reads toGBA and GBAP to detect recombinational events. We applied our tool to a set of samples with known and sus- pected GBA alterations, which had been comprehensively analyzed by various methods including Southern blotting and cDNA cloning. We detected all known SNVs and small insertions/deletions. For cases with suspected rearrange-ments, we observed altered relative GBA andGBAP read ratios. The ndings were of two kinds: 1) suggestive of recombination-mediated conversions, 2) suggestive ofrecombination-mediated large deletions. Our observations are consistent with theoretical considerations put forward previously. In conclusion, we have developed a method thatcan reliably detect all types of disease-relevant alterations in GBA . This will allow for accurate molecular classi cation of Gaucher patients and of individuals at higher risk forParkinson 's disease. N. Ameziane: A.

Sub-jects (541) diagnosed with global developmental delay (GDD) or intellectual disability (ID) of unknown cause have been enrolled, and aCGH tests have a positive rate of 23.7%(111/468). Fragile X syndrome or Rett-like syndrome tests and treatable targeted NGS-based panel were also utilizedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 599for assessment. Furthermore, WES was performed on 34 cases with Agilent SureSelect target enrichment system using Illumina HiSeq2000. WES data were analyzed using Varseq v2.1.0 and Illumina BaseSpace Variant Interpreter. Trio analyses were performed on 24 aCGH-negative cases, thus far revealing 4 known rare pathogenic variants asso-ciated with GDD/ID. To determine the consistency in CNV detection between aCGH and WES tests, 10 aCGH-positive singletons were included. CNVs were detected in 11 out of13 regions using WES. On average, 115 CNVs with p- values < 0.01 were called per case. These CNVs ranged from 119bp to 15Mbp in span, with duplications accountingfor 65.0% of total calls. Approximately 1% (30/2764) drawn for qPCR validation, and of the tested CNVs have relative quantities suggestive orindicative of their CNV types. WES provides comprehen- sive and high-throughput information with the potential to cut medical expenditures, elevate diagnostic yield, andreduce diagnostic odyssey. P. Chen: None. T. Liu: None. Y.

Hickey Pacic Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, United States Introduction: Long-read sequencing has revealed more than 20,000 structural variants spanning over 12 Mb in ahealthy human genome. Short-read sequencing fails to detect most structural variants but has remained the more effective approach for small variants, due to 10-15% errorrates in long reads, and copy-number variants (CNVs), due to lack of effective long-read variant callers. The develop- ment of PacBio highly accurate long reads (HiFi reads) withread lengths of 10-25 kb and quality >99% presents the opportunity to capture all classes of variation with one approach. Methods: We sequence the Genome in a Bottle bench- mark sample HG002 and an individual with a presumed Mendelian disease with HiFi reads. We call SNVs andindels with DeepVariant and extend the structural variant caller pbsv to call CNVs using read depth and clipping signatures. Results: For 18-fold coverage with 13 kb HiFi reads, variant calling in HG002 achieves an F1 score of 99.7% for SNVs, 96.6% for indels, and 96.4% for structural variants.Additionally, we detect more than 300 CNVs spanning around 10 Mb. For the Mendelian disease case, HiFi readsreveal thousands of variants that were overlooked by short- read sequencing, including a candidate causative structural variant. Conclusions: These results illustrate the ability of HiFi reads to comprehensively detect variants, including those associated with human disease. A.M. Wenger: A.

P15.37.B Targeting clinically signi cant dark regions of the human genome with high accuracy long read sequencing L. A. Aro, C. Heiner , Y. Tsai, J. Harding, J. Ziegle Pacic Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, United States Introduction: There are many clinically important genes in \"dark\"regions of the human genome, with poor coverage due to low ampli cation or dif culty mapping with other technologies. These dark regions often contain highly homologous genes and pseudo genes, repeat expansions, and areas of biased base composition. Ambiguous mappingdue to the limitations of short-read sequencing prevents accurate assessment of structural rearrangements and importantly, short-reads limit the ability to phase acrossgene regions. Materials and Methods: We investigated several important dark region genes using PacBio SMRT Sequen-cing using long-range PCR and/or direct sequencing using a CRISPR/cas9 mediated No-Amp for target enrichment approach. Genes included HTT,FMR1 ,CYP21A2 and HBB . Sample prep and sequencing methods are described in detail. Results: Here we show results from successfully sequencing a key portion of the HTT gene using both No- Amp and long-range PCR. This comparison includes a set of samples with moderate to extensive repeat expansions,demonstrating highly accurate sequencing of the repeat region with both approaches. General advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Conclusion: We demonstrate that accurate, long read sequencing provides new opportunities for sequencing clinically relevant but dif cult regions of the human genome that are underrepresented in short-read sequencing. The preferred method of targeting depends on the gene of interest and project goals. SMRT Sequencing of theseregions enables a better understanding of the relationship between genetic factors and personal health.600 J. del PicchiaL.A. Aro: A.

P15.38.C Genetic pro ling and early cancer detection using NGS- based Liquid Biopsy A. Silesia, Katowice, Poland,3Holy Cross Cancer Centre, Kielce, Poland There is an urgent need for early and ef cient cancer detection, risk strati cation, and therapy cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) may provide sensi- tive and representative marker for that purpose. The project aimed at developing non-invasive genetic diagnostics andcancer monitoring, based on the liquid biopsy (LB) for cancer patients and people at risk. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of 82 breast, colorectal or lung cancer cases was isolatedfrom plasma. Additionally, breast and colorectal frozen tumours from 12 patients were collected together with the corresponding 9 blood samples. A deep coverage WGS ofthe tumour DNA and a standard coverage WGS for the corresponding germline DNA were performed to assess mutational burden and somatic CNVs in 10 patients. Ashallow WGS (sWGS) and targeted breast cancer-related gene panel sequencing was performed for 80 LB samples. For 6 tumour samples most common PIK3CA somaticvariants in breast cancer were identi ed (H1047R and E545K). None of these variants was uncovered in the LB samples, while somatic variants identi ed in ctDNA were missing in the tumour DNA. As expected, the CNV analysis performed for tumour samples allowed to distinguishsubclonal tumour variations for the same patient. A method allowing breast cancer detection at a relatively early stage, based on sWGS and CNV analysis, was developed. Dis- crepancies observed between the tumour and the LB results may be partially due to clonal variants in the heterogenous tumour tissues, but it also suggests the need for a furtherimprovement regarding sensitivity of liquid biopsy methods.

Frequency detecting of molecular alterations in ctDNA should be an alternative toolfor monitoring disease progression. Method: We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) based ctDNA panel assay containing 197 targeted genes andsequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550. A 41-year old patient with stage IV colorectal cancer was examined in this study. Results: We found 8 mutations in this patient in 2018 when he found the cancer and the mutation sites (concurrentchemoradiotherapy) and Avastin for this patient. Two months later, focused on were 0.69%, 0.72% and 0.34%, respectively. After given the same treatment, the mutationAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 601rates were increased to 16.08%, 14.02% and 10.25%, respectively. The cancer therapist decided to change to immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy, and the mutation rates decreased to 5.92%, 5.59% and 4.35%, respectively. Conclusions: The earlier determination of ctDNA can help track tumor response and resistance to therapy, and may also help prevent recurrence. The more clinical validation and utility of liquid biopsy would improvet ofquality of life in cancer patients. C.C. Hung: A.

A. 1Medical Cancer Candiolo, using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as an innovative non-invasive approach for early detection and monitoring of cancer. This approach over- coming the space-time pro le constraint of tissue biopsies opens a new scenario also for vascular malformations due to somatic mosaicism. We propose here this approach as a fast non-invasive reliable tool for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome(KTS) diagnosis. Six patients group suffering from KTS were selected. Blood samples from both peripheral and efferent vein from vascular malformation were collectedand cfDNA extracted. Tissue biopsies from vascular lesions were also collected. CfDNA libraries were performed using Oncomine Pan-Cancer Cell-Free Assay. Ion Proton for sequencing and Ion Reporter Software for analysis were used. Different mutations on PIK3CA gene were detected in all patients including p.Glu542Lys and p.Glu545Gly. Thesame mutation detected in tissue was detected in liquid biopsy with a variant allele frequency (VAF) ranging from0,1-0,2% in cfDNA from peripheral vein to 1-2% in cfDNA from efferent vein. We demonstrate that cfDNA-NGS- Liquid Biopsy is able to identify the PIK3CA mutation detected in affected tissues. Moreover, we have shown that blood sample withdrawal at the lesion site increases VAF rate with an order of magnitude above the limit of detection(usually 0,05%) lowering the risk of false negative. Finally, the non-invasiveness of the method avoids any risk of bleeding, being easily performed also in children. We pro-pose this method as method of choice for KTS diagnosis and subsequent therapy tailored to the genetic defect. We acknowledge ILA association. M. Palmieri: None. L. Di Blasio: None. A.

Veltman1 1Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom,2Department of Human Genetics, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition andBehaviour, of gen, Netherlands Long range PCR for targeted long-read sequencing has many practical uses, however the inherent sequencing error(~10%) of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) necessi- tates signi cant sequencing depths to achieve acceptable levels of con dence. Several methods exist for target cap- turing, most can be broadly categorised under PCR and CRISPR-Cas enrichment approaches. Here we report on the usage of long-range PCR to target capture large regionsspanning rare de novo mutations linked to male infertility for sequencing with ONT for phasing analysis. Long-range PCR was used on 5-10kb regions to achieve minimumsequencing depths of >2,000x coverage, >10 that of CRISPR enrichments and >90% less off-target sequencing. Individually unique target regions removed the necessity forbarcodes, saving time, cost and yield. This approach allowed bringing costs to as little as \u20ac15 per sample in runs of 100 samples. The optimised method involved specialisedprimer design with our bespoke primer tool and improved PCR conditions, followed by sequencing on ONT MinION602 J. del Picchiawith adapted library preparation. Using input concentrations twice the standard recommendation achieved >2-fold increased to previous yields. \"Refuelling \"flowcells mid-run buffer restored nanopores from <1% to >80%, a further 6.8 fold increase in yield. More than 30 billion base calls are consistently obtainedfollowing this procedure, matching best-in eldflowcell performance. Currently available methods for long-read sequencing and target capture can be expensive, time con-suming and overly off target. Our proposed methodology provides a combination of common approaches that have been optimised to achieve greater results more ef ciently. None. J.A. Veltman: None. P15.42.A Challenges in identifying a large complex chromosomal rearrangement by long reads sequencing B. Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,2Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Centre, Athens, Greece Background: The success in the identi cation of genomic structural variations (SVs) in routine clinical protocolsmainly depends on the complexity and size of SVs. Short and/or simple SV are being successfully identi ed by cytogenetic techniques or short read sequencing, while largenested and complex rearrangements demand case-speci c investigation via the application of novel emerging tech- nologies. For a clinical case with developmental delaycytogenetic analysis revealed a large complex de novo chromosomal rearrangement. We aimed to evaluate the potential of whole genome long-reads sequencing to resolvethe precise variant con guration and underlying mechanism. Methods: Long-reads sequencing was performed by MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Bioinformatic pipeline of reference-based alignment with SVs calling in combination with De novo assembly was applied. Reads were aligned to the reference using NGMLR or minimap2, following by detection of SVs with SVIM and Snif fles. Canu was used for De novo assembly . Results: We have performed 6 effective runs using MinION long-read sequencing and reached 13,2x theore- tical coverage of the human genome. Median read qualitywas 12.44, with an average N50 read length of 10.2 kb. Read-depth analysis identi ed the gain for triplication andduplication, yet the precise breakpoints cannot be de ned (reads coverage variation). NGMLR alignment in combina- tion with Canu-trimming, followed by SVIM variant calling, resulted in a few probable inversions and one tandem duplication. Conclusions: For determination of precise breakpoints of a large nested SV, which is much larger than the average read, long-reads sequencing needs to be combined with additional long-range technologies.

Gerber of Mainz, Mainz, Ger- many Nanopore sequencing has emerged as a promising approach to overcome some of the limitations of classical Next-Generation-Sequencing. Among the bene ts of this tech- nique are direct and PCR-free sequencing of RNA or DNA, native detection of basepair-modi cations and full-length read sequencing. This has led to a number of interesting applications, also for clinical purposes. Here, we were especially interested in the detection of transcript isoformsduring neuronal differentiation, thus making use of the capability of a nanopore sequencer to provide full-length transcript sequences. Previous studies have shown thatduring neuronal differentiation the 3 'ends of transcripts can extend by several kilo-basepairs and the presence or absence of this feature conveys critical function. Moreover,key players in neuronal differentiation, such as the BDNF- gene have been shown to have several distinct isoforms, that speci cally trigger different receptors, evoking varying signalling cascades. To investigate transcript isoforms dur- ing neuronal differentiation, we employed a differentiation protocol in a cell line of murine neuronal precursor cells.During differentiation, the cells were harvested on 4 time- points. The RNA was converted to cDNA and library pre- paration for a nanopore sequencing device was done as permanufacturers cations. Subsequently on a nanopore device and basecalling using the MinKNOW software followed. Conclusively, we were able to test thefeasibility of nanopore sequencing in our lab isoforms during neuronal differentia- tion. Results be presented and discussed. C. Hewel: None. C. Vennin: None. B.

Olaso CEA / National Center for Research in Human Genomics, Evry, France We have optimised next-generation sequencing on (PCR free), whole exome, andRNAseq. optimal loading concentration for each application is 2.0 nM, 1.5 nM and 2.25 nM in standard workflow, respectively, resulting in 77 -85% of clusters passing lter and low level of optical duplicates. We observed index-dependent differences in sequencing per- formance in the under- or overrepresented (27% less or 32% more than the average number of reads per library, calcu- lated across 68 runs). In contrast, we observed little effect ofinsert size on clustering ef ciency (for insert sizes ranging 265-476 bp in the same flowcell). The end-of-read quality scores are higher in the NovaSeq compared to HiSeq XFive, resulting in less sequencing errors. In contrast, we observed slightly increased systematic bias in C > A and G > T errors at the end of NovaSeq reads, possibly due to thedual channel technology. The reduction in run time is an important advantage over the HiSeq platform, for example in our emergency neonatal genome sequencing for Fastge-nomics. In conclusion, NovaSeq produces more output in shorter time, with sequencing quality similar to previous generation of sequencers. However, the unprecedentedplexity allowed by the large sequencing capacity of Nova- Seq presents new challenges in pooling certain indexes. Z. Gerber: None. J. Tassin: None. F. Jobard: None. F.

Mielinis, A. Sta yt, A. Lubys Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Vilnius, Lithuania Introduction: With the advances in the next-generation sequencing and capacity of sequencers growing, more and more sample can be analyzed in a single run. To achieveefcient, well balanced run, all libraries must be carefully quanti ed and pooled. Current strategies rely on qPCR,604 J. del PicchiaddPCR, fluorometry (Qubit) or capillary electrophoresis, however, they are either time consuming, costly or inac- curate, leading to unbalanced ratios between pooled librar- ies, especially when handling many samples. Underrepresented libraries may require re-sequencing, fur- ther increasing the cost of the experiment. Materials and Methods: Here we describe a quanti cation-free NGS library normalization method, based on library tagging via PCR. Tagged libraries arethen bound by a capturing reagent and puri ed using magnetic beads. Multiple libraries can be pooled early in the normalization procedure yielding excellent sample distribu-tion within a pool and signi cantly shortening the whole normalization procedure. Results: We show that the normalization method produces well balanced library pool with coef cient of variation (CV) being controlled under <10 % with no observed effect on GC bias or genomic content, making itvery convenient to use with samples within an extreme range of GC content. Conclusions: Although the technology is compatible with diverse library types, including whole human genome, exome or small genome, the method is going to be the most benecial when working with plentiful of samples and various inputs of genomic material. Due to the simplicity of materials and a work flow, the normalization has a potential to be automated, simplifying the normalization and poolingprocedures even further. P. Mielinis: A.

However, in certain cases, either due to the complexity or the location of the aberration,whole exome sequencing (WES) might not yield a patho- genic variant, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) may be required. We report herein four recent cases diagnosed inour lab, which were all initially missed by WES and later resolved only by sequencing the entire genome:1-Promoter mutation: Four patients of two unrelated withportal vein thrombosis and macrocephaly. WGS revealed the-270C>G homozygous pro- moter of the PIGM gene.2-Large deletions: Eight patients from 7 different families of Iraqi-Jewish origin with auto- somal recessive intractable diarrhea of infancy. Linkage analysis with WGS enabled the detection of two over-lapping deletions on chromosome 16.3-Intronic mutation: Two siblings with PS6 syndrome without mutation in the coding sequence of the candidate gene, ARSB . WGS, revealed deep intronic mutation in the gene, which leads to insertion of a pseudo-exon.4-Large duplication: Three female siblings of Iraqi-Jewish descent, presented withcerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, seizures and cognitive disability. WGS with Bam le analysis identi ed a novel biallelic duplications in the COQ5 gene. It is clear that WGS is a powerful tool, which can improve the rate of discovery of disease-causing mutations, especially in such challenging cases. With the falling cost of WGS, moreindividuals are pursuing this option, which enable to enrich the databases, and lead to better diagnosis. A. Eliyahu: None. D. Marek-Yagel: None. B.

P15.51.A Phased WGS by direct library preparation from 240 FACS sorted cells for comprehensive genetics in multi-ple myelomaAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Stockholm, Sweden,3Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden,4Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction: multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and aggressive plasma cell malignancy characterized by geneticheterogeneity and complexity. In addition to single nucleotide variants (SNV), tumor cells often carry multiple complex structural variants (SV) and copy number varia-tions (CNV). Nonetheless, only limited character- ization is performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in standard care. Linked reads whole genomesequencing (WGS) - or phased WGS - has shown great promise for providing improved calling of structural aber- rations. However, its implementation has been hampered bythe dif culty of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA preparation. Materials and Methods: here we demonstrate that DNA preparation can be circumvented by direct loading of 240 FACS sorted cells into the linked read library preparation. Besides providing a simpli ed work flow, this procedure results in longer DNA molecules (median 190kbp) and longer phase blocks (median N50 length 16.9Mbp) compared to standard methods. Results: in the ongoing initial benchmarking, all CNVs and SVs previously found by FISH were identi ed through linked read sequencing. Additionally, several aberrationsnot detected by an expanded FISH panel were identi ed. The latter remain to be veri ed by FISH. Conclusions: the use of linked read technologies combined with our direct cell loading protocol and diagnostic flow cytometry can feasibly establish a more comprehensive genetic characterization for MM - and otherdiseases - in clinical routine. This will contribute to improved diagnostics and risk strati cation in MM. C. Gran: None. L. Pe\u00f1a-P\u00e9rez: None. J. Eisfeldt: None. C. Gustafsson: None. J. Borg Bruchfeld: None. J.

For complex diseases, such asatrial brillation (AF), precise correction of the associated mutation is crucial. Here, we generated and corrected iPSC lines from two AF patients carrying different heterozygousSHOX2 mutations. In this context, we developed a novel strategy for the scarless correction of heterozygous muta- tions. It is based on a stochastic enrichment by sib-selection(subdivision of edited cells into small cell pools), followed by allele quanti cation via digital PCR and next generation sequencing to detect isogenic subpopulations. This methoddoes not require the use of antibiotic selection or cell sorting and can be easily combined with existing improvements for gene editing such as modi ed Cas9 enzymes and base editors. By avoiding the insertion of silent mutations that are used to prevent re-cutting by Cas9, this method is suited for the correction of intronic or intergenic variants. Thepresented strategy helps to overcome the low ef of homology-dependent repair in iPSCs and therefore facil- itates the generation of isogenic control lines that representthe gold standard for modeling complex cardiac diseases in vitro. In summary, we generated the rst AF model using patient-speci c and gene-corrected iPSCs and developed a novel method for the correction of heterozygous mutations.

Results: For the 34 newborns and infant included, the positive molecular diagnosis rate (IV and V classesvariations) was 56% (19/34) and suggested care manage- ment changes for 47% (9/19) of the positive cases.

Many studies have illustrated the diagnostic and immediate clinicalimpact of WES. However, a vast majority of patients remain undiagnosed and there is little documentation of the long- term(>1year) clinical utility. Methods: This is a three-year follow-up analysis to our previous publication(PMID: 30109123). The diagnostic yield was 41% (43/104). 46 non-diagnosed patients consented for thereanalysis. Depending on the ava ilability, either raw sequen- cing data were reanalyzed, or stored DNA were re-sequenced. The long-term outcome of 36 diagnosed patients weremeasured by clinical follow-u p and review of medical records. Results: WES reanalysis gave rise to twelve additional diagnoses (table), boosting the overall diagnostic yield from41% to 53%. The reanalysis of one patient had discovery of MN1 C-Terminal Truncation (MCTT) syn- drome caused by mutations in MN1 (PMID:31834374). Currently, we are prospectively collecting and sharing more clinical information on the disease. If you have a patient with MCTT syndrome or would like to learn more, pleasevisit https://humandiseasegenes.nl/mn1/ . After three years of follow-up, change in clinical management was observed in 72.2% of the families(26/36), leading to positive changein outcome in four patients(11%). Conclusions: WES reanalysis provides promising addi- tional diagnoses to patients. Longitudinal follow-up showedthat a genetic diagnosis gave rise to positive management and outcomes for patients. ID Sample Type Gene Variant(s) Segregation Diagnosis (OMIM) Inheritance by CRSIPR/Cas9 J. Ekholm, N. Piganeau , Y. Tsai, I. McLaughlin, J. Ziegle Pacbio, Menlo Park,, CA, United States Genomic regions with extreme base composition bias and repetitive sequences have long proven challenging for tar- geted enrichment methods, as they rely upon some form of ampli cation. Similarly, most DNA sequencing technolo- gies struggle to faithfully sequence regions of low com- plexity. This has especially been trying for repeat expansion disorders such as Fragile X disease, Huntington disease and various Ataxias, where the repetitive elements range from several hundreds of bases to tens of kilobases. We havedeveloped a robust, ampli cation-free targeted enrichment technique, called No-Amp Targeted Sequencing, that employs the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In conjunction withSMRT Sequencing, which delivers long reads spanning the entire repeat expansion, high consensus accuracy, and uni- form coverage, these previously inaccessible regions arenow accessible. This method is completely ampli cation- free, therefore removing any PCR errors and biases from the experiment. Furthermore, this technique also preservesnative DNA molecules, allowing for direct detection and characterization of epigenetic signatures. The No-Amp method is a two-day protocol that is compatible with mul-tiplexing of multiple targets and multiple samples in a single reaction, using as little as 1 g of genomic DNA input per sample. We have successfully targeted a repeat unites (>13 kb). Using the No-Amp method we have isolated hundredsof individual on-target molecules, allowing for reliable repeat size estimation, mosaicism detection and identi ca- tion of interruption sequences - all aspects of repeatexpansion disorders important for better understanding the underlying disease mechanisms.

P15.56.C Innovative approach for digital gene expression and alternative polyadenylation pro ling608 J. del PicchiaZ. a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome complexity origi- nated from regulatory events such as differential gene expression, alternative polyadenylation and others, andallows the increase in diagnostic capacity and precision. Here, we report TAS-seq (Terminator-Assisted Synthesis- based sequencing) - a novel mRNA 3 'termini. We demon- strate speci c enrichment for 3 'UTR/polyA tail junctions by a simplest possible one-step protocol which takes under2 hours to complete. To achieve that, we synthesized modied terminators which allow to generate cDNA fragments labeled by sequencing adapters at both terminiat the reverse transcription step. Results: To demonstrate proof-of-principle and evaluate dose-response in resulting libraries, we have utilizedUniversal Human Reference RNA, Human Brain Reference RNA and ERCC spike-in controls. We obtained high- quality stranded libraries from 20 pg - 1 ug of total RNAwhich implies the utility of our approach for single-cell sequencing. This notion was con rmed upon successful integration of TAS-seq into the droplet-based scRNA-seqprotocol. Moreover, modi ed terminators allow for easy introduction of unique molecular identi ers to correct for PCR bias. Conclusions: We conclude that for high-throughput gene expression pro ling applications which do not speci cally require information on alternative splicing events, 3 ' mRNA termini counting approach is a cost-effective alternative to whole transcriptome sequencing. TAS-seq workflow proposed in this work makes it one of the simplest RNA-seq library preparation methods reported in theeld. Z. Kapustina: None. J. Sulgaite: None. S. Zeimyte: None.

Heterozygous +4t o+13 residue expansions of a poly-Ala stretch in the PHOX2B gene do cause CCHS. In vitro stu- dies have shown formation of toxic intracytoplasmic aggregates and impaired PHOX2B mediated transactivation of target genes, that can be reversed by treatments inducingheat shock response and autophagy (i.e. 17AAG). Material and Methods: RNA-sequencing analysis SK-N-BE and+13Ala PHOX2B and relative controls, with/without 17AAG treatment. Data were analyzed through a standard pipeline and lists of differentially expressed genes subjectedto Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Results: Gene expression pro les of transfectant cell lines allowed us to 1) rank genes and pathways resulting todrive the most deleterious effects of the mutation (i.e. apoptosis, proteasome, autophagy, effect of pathways already reported to be bene cial to CCHS (i.e. rapamycin, progesterone); 3) validate a number of differentially expressed genes and veri ed the effect of newly identi ed pathogenic mechanisms. Conclusions: we have recapitulated i) the presence of pathways-hallmarks-perturbations already known to play arole in polyAla dependent CCHS pathogenesis and ii) the benecial effect of drugs like 17AAG, in reverting deleterious polyAla consequences, thus providing a \"proof of concept \"of the feasibility of the RNA-seq approach to disclose molecular mechanisms of orphan diseases.

However, despite the considerable amount of research conducted in this eld, the medical use of micro- RNAs as biomarkers and the translation of microRNA proling into meaningful clinical data remain a work in progress. This scenario might be caused by the low repro-ducibility among studies and the low disease-speci city of the microRNAs reported as biomarkers. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that the selection of kit and protocol forsmallRNAseq library preparation, the method of choice for microRNA pro ling, can have a great impact in the inconsistency of the results. Starting from the same samples,we prepared smallRNAseq libraries using: three commer- cially available kits based on xed adapter ligation, two based on degenerated adapters ligation, one based on tem-plate switch technology, and one based on monoadapter ligation and circularization, exploiting all current smallR- NAseq library preparation methods. We identi ed strengths and weaknesses of each protocol regarding sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility. In addition, we evaluated the use of unique molecular identi er sequences in two of these kits. Remarkably, Illumina 's kit seemed to be the outlier when compared to the rest of protocols in spite of being the most widespread library preparation kit.

P15.65.C A simple next generation sequencing method to detect sequence variants causing alpha Vanherberghen , A. Hedrum Devyser, H\u00e4gersten, SwedenBackground: Thalassemia 's are inherited blood disorders characterized by abnormal hemoglobin production. Today,several methods are used sequentially for variant analysis of thalassemia patients, adding costs and increasing turn- around times. These methods include, but are not limited to,GAP-PCR, Sanger sequencing and MLPA. Often, if a variant or deletion is found in one gene, analysis of the other gene is not performed. Method: We developed an amplicon-based NGS method on the Illumina sequencers using a single oligo-mix to detect virtually all known variants for alpha and betathalassemia. The method includes sequencing of HBB, HBA1 and HBA2 genes as well as direct detection of the most common deletions in alpha and beta thalassemia(GAP-PCR). Regions upstream and downstream of the above genes are sequenced to detect deletions by CNV analysis. The protocol is rapid and user-friendly, requiring less than one hour of hands-on time. Results: Evaluation of 125 clinical samples revealed that all expected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and deletionswere detected. Additional variants were found in 15% (19/ 125) of samples and occurred primarily in the other gene ( i. e. if the original variant was in the alpha gene, the additional variant was found in the beta gene and vice-versa). Conclusions: We report the successful development of a rapid, NGS-based assay to detect variants involved in bothalpha and beta thalassemia which identi ed all con rmed variants, and picked up previously undetected variants. These ndings demonstrate the need for a single method that can simultaneously detect variants in both alpha and beta thalassemia 's. B. Vanherberghen: A.

Results: It was shown that one of two designed siRNAs for TIRR and all three designed siRNAs for MAD2L2 cantly the Additionally, TIRR expression as a response on three non-targeting siRNA was described in comparisonwith non-transfected cells and cells with transfection reagent only (maximal enhancing was in 2,4 times, p~0,02). We are running now experiments to estimate theimpact of developed knockdown on the HDR ef cacy to Conclusions: we developed ef cient knockdown of two key factors involved in DNA repair pathways - TIRR and MAD2L2. We also discovered a unique reaction of TIRR transcript expression in response to any targeted and non-targeted arti cial siRNA, which should be discovered in more details and can possibly used to further control DNA repair process.

P15.67.B Effectiveness and sustainability of a multidimensional approach based on tele-health and multi-OMIC testing:the Italian Undiagnosed Network , Bartuli, A. genomic sequencing and its implementation in clinical practice are widely recognisedas cost-effective diagnostic milestones. However, avail- ability of these technologies in the clinical setting is still limited and not widely accessible. The diagnostic odysseyof undiagnosed subjects and their families is still a major constrain preventing appropriate management and care. We report on a two-year experience of the Italian UndiagnosedPatients Network of experts based on an e-health approach combined with a multi-OMIC work flow.Materials and Methods: Since January 2018, 312 patients from 24 Italian rare diseases reference centers have been evaluated in the frame of 35 multidisciplinary sessions involving 20 experienced clinicians selected on a case-to- case basis. About 40% of patients underwent a multi-OMIC analysis directed by clinical presentation. Results: The effectiveness (evidence-based) and sustain- ability (cost-effectiveness) of this multidimensional approach was proven by a signi cant reduction of diagnostic costs (>25%) and an incremental rate of diagnoses (> 60%). Conclusions: The proposed approach has produced a multiplying effect, allowing the improvement of care of undiagnosed patients greater than it would be expected by simply adding the single experts 'abilities. Sharing competence among network members fosters the develop- ment of new knowledge and creates a critical mass of patients.

Langhorst, E. T. Dimalanta, T. B. Davis New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, United States RNA-sequencing is a powerful tool for the study of gene regulation and function. Applications of RNA-sequencing have vastly expanded with improvements to low RNA input library preparation methods. Although analyzing low-inputsamples is necessary to answer certain biological questions, generating these libraries introduces greater biases with additional PCR cycles that amplify transcripts dis-proportionately. To better gauge true transcript abundance levels, unique molecular identi ers (UMIs) can be used to distinguish PCR duplicates from distinct original molecules.Accurate identi cation of such artifacts can signi cantly impact quanti cation of transcript abundance. To address this need in RNA-seq, we have developed barcoded adap-tors incorporating UMIs. We have developed 96 UMI-containing barcoded adap- tors optimized across various RNA inputs (10 ng to 1 g). Ligation of barcoded adaptors followed by PCR enrichment produced high-quality library and sequencing metrics (e.g. yields and coverage across transcript length). However,duplication rates signi cantly differed when utilizing traditional computational approaches to identify duplicatesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 611based on mapping position compared to analysis incorpor- ating UMIs. As many as 90% of reads identi ed as duplicates using read position alone were determined to in fact originate from unique molecules, increasing the total number of reads available for further analysis. In this study we show that incorporation of UMIs into RNA-sequencing analysis allows for a more accurate calculation of transcript abundance. Use of UMIs allows for identi cation of true read duplicates in RNA-seq, thereby increasing transcript detection accuracy and improving sensitivity of differential expression analysis. Furthermore, our adaptors incorporate barcodes duringadaptor ligation allowing for PCR-free library Posfai: Employment (full or part-time); Signi cant; New England K.

Patients have been grouped based on their clinical features: isolated NDD (developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy); NDD plus (any of the previous plus an additional or dysmorphic was 27,8% (90/324) and 26,5% (31/117) patients by CE and WES, The NDD and NDD plus groups represented 55% (243/441) of our patients, with a diagnostic yield ranging from 28.2% to31.1% (WES and CE, respectively). Among the different clinical categories, diagnostic yield was highest in the NDG (15/38, 39.5% by CE) and in the \"others \"(1/14, 7.1% by WES). Achieving a diagnosis is important for patients and their families, as it can alter clinical management and the provision of accurategenetic counseling. Our results are globally consistent with those of comparable studies, highlighting CE and WES as efcient strategies for the diagnosis of a wide range of suspected genetic disorders, particularly of patients with NDG, NDD and MCA.

The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) inpatients with EE/DE with unknown PicchiaMaterial and Methods: We analysed the exomes of a cohort of 71 adult unrelated patients with EE/DE, which had already undergone single or multiple prior genetic tests (array-CGH, single gene or gene-panel screening) resulted negative. Variants were classi ed according to the Amer- ican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)guidelines. Signi cant variants were validated and veri ed for inheritance by Sanger sequencing, when possible. Results: In 18 patients WES analysis disclosed a total of 24 causative variants in epilepsy associated genes of 24 variants were novel. In 4 (22%) patients the new genetic diagnosis had therapeutic implications. We estimated a diagnostic delay of 38.5 years (18-64.9). Conclusions: In our cohort of undiagnosed adult EE/DE patients, WES analysis allowed us to obtain a diagnostic yield of 25.3%. Despite the considerable diagnostic delay,genetic diagnosis had a signi cant impact on patients ' management, allowing in selected cases for a targeted therapy. Concluding, early WES analysis in EE/DE patientswould prevent \"diagnostic odyssey \"and unnecessary costs. R. L. Laura: None. T. Pippucci: None. M.C. Baroni: None. C. Stipa: None. B. Mostacci: None.

P15.73.B Validation a new for ampli cation (WGA) and NGS sequencing in Clinic\u00bb, Moscow, Russian Federation,3LLC AB-Vector, San Diego, CA, United States We have validated new WGA technology, AB-WGA (AB Vector, USA) for aneuploidy detection (PGT-A). Theadvantage of this technology is exhaustive random priming of the template DNA, which is crucial for minimizing ampli cation bias and improving genome coverage. Unlike most other WGA methods that either sacri ce speci city of copy number variation (CNV) detection for high genome coverage, or genome coverage for increased accuracy ofCNV detection, AB-WGA provides nearly complete gen- ome coverage while maintaining high accuracy of CNVdetection. Genomic DNA from the biopsy material (3-10 cells) was extracted and ampli ed using AB-WGA kit. Libraries were sequenced using either Miseq reagent kit V3 (150 cycles) or NextSeq 500 reagent kit v2.5 (75 cycles). CNV-charts generation was performed using software developed by AB Vector. For comparison, we sequencedseveral trophectoderm biopsies (TE) samples using Illumina karyotype and AB-WGAkits. We also analyzed CNV-charts of TE and the inner cell mass of embryos (ICM). We have observed high con- cordance between TE and ICM samples using the ABVector technology. About 10% of samples have shown different karyotypes between TE and ICM, similar to the recent study (Victor et al. 2018). Performance of the new kitwas quite satisfactory, featuring a simpli ed protocol, better throughput and improved CNV resolution. Further studies are required for validation of this technology in PGD fordetection of monogenic disorders as well as for registration of the kit as an IVD medical product for use in reproductive genetics.

Yamada , T. Uehara, H. Suzuki, K. Kosaki Center for medical genetics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan Background: Prediction of variants associated with abnormal splicing from exome or whole genome sequen-cing data without transcriptome data is dif cult and unre- liable for non-canonical splicing variants that occur outside of canonical donor/ acceptor consensus sites (gt/ag).Recently, an algorithm SpliceAI based on machine learning theory was developed to quantify variant 's potential to cause abnormal splicing as the delta score that ranges fromzero to one. Clinical utility of SpliceAI has not been established. Methods: Using SpliceAI, we scored all the de novo variants obtained from 964 trio exome data which derived from Japan 's national clinical sequencing project Initiativeon Rare and Undiagnosed diseases (IRUD). The delta score above 0.2 was considered positive. Results: Among 964 patients, 255 patients had one or more de novo variants with positive delta score (> =0.2). A total of 332 variants was detected including 264 non- canonical variants. The list of genes to which these 264variants belonged included 63 known disease causative genes. Thirty seven of the 63 genes could account for de novo autosomal dominant or X-linked conditions. Among37 patients with de novo non-canonical variants in these genes, 15 patients had phenotype compatible with the genotype (41%). Analysis of 964 patients unraveled denovo non-canonical splicing variants with positive delta score among 31 loss-of-function-intolerant genes of which loss-of-function mutations are likely to be pathogenic. Discussions: Positive predictive value of Splice AI at non-canonical sites exceeded 40% and 31 loss-of-function- intolerant genes were demonstrated to be fair candidates ofnovel disease-causative genes.

Bossuyt Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Whole Genome Sequencing SNP arrays (clinical) Whole Exome Sequencing(WES) for the detection of CNVs and SNVs respectively. WGS is thought to outperform WES as it suffers from limited biases due to the PCR-free library preparation andthe absence of capture. However, the B-allele frequency distribution (BAF) of WGS heterozygous variants deviates from the expected binomial normal distribution. An asym-metric enrichment of variants with low BAF (<0.25) is observed in both Genome In A Bottle (GIAB) cell lines and patients, excluding cell culture artefacts as a source. Nosimilar enrichment is observed for heterozygous variants with a high BAF (>0.75). Applying more stringent quality thresholds to the data, such as extracting GIAB con dent regions or increasing depth, diminishes the width of the distribution but does not remove it. GIAB data shows that ltering out variants with low BAF successfully diminishes the number of false positives but at the price of removing true positives.

Raman Ghent University, 9000, BelgiumB-cell lymphoma (BCL) tumors are physically related to the cardiovascular system and generally have a large cellturnover. As a collective, they are therefore excellent can- didates for liquid biopsy (LB)-based research. The omni- present, cheap and standardized shallow whole-genomesequencing (sWGS) of cell-free DNA for copy number proling, is not suf ciently explored. To resolve this, a prospective cohort of 38 Hodgkin (HL) and 86 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (nHL) patients has been recruited, following sWGS of 255 samples. At diagnosis, LBs had detectable abnormalities in 84.2% of HL and 74.4% of nHL patients. Pro les from paired tissue biopsies showed high correlation within nHL (r=0.815 \u00b1 0.043); and, compared to tissue, LBs had alterations with mostly higher amplitudes for both HL (P=.005) and nHL ( P=.026), implying tumor DNA is more abundant in blood samples. In addition, sequencingreads were mapped to viral reference genomes, which indicated that 15 HL and 13 nHL cases had signi cantly elevated titers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at diagnosis. Allpatients that tested positive during routine EBV testing, had increased plasmatic viral read fractions. Longitudinal analysis indicated that, when detectable, copy number patterns were similar across restaging moments in refractory/relapsed patients. Moreover, the overall anomaly of copy number pro les correlated with disease status. Finally, predictive modeling demonstrates that LBs might aid in case of doubt between, e.g., HL versus nHL: receiveroperating characteristic analysis produced an area under the curve of 0.972. This could be helpfull when the disease is located in sites that are dif cult to reach. L. Raman: None. P16.06.C Blended phenotypes: an unusual expression of During recent years, DNA sequencing capacity has con- siderably improved genetic diagnostic rate, contributed to identi cation of new genetic causes of rare monogenic diseases, and challenged our perception about the extension and complexity of some phenotypes. Comprehensive genomic approaches, clinical exome and whole-exomesequencing (WES) have shown that, in a small subset, the presented phenotype is the product of concomitant mono- genic disorders in a single patient, giving rise to so-called\"blended phenotypes\". We used a WES approach in 4,027 individuals referred for genetic diagnostic study at CGPP (2016-2019), for targeted disease-speci c multigene panels (n=3,284); or for clinical exome or analysis of WES in a trio ( n=743), in clinically heterogeneous presentations. We systematically reviewed the genetic data of these 743cases, either (singleton) clinical exome ( n=629) or WES in trio (patient and both parents) ( n=114). Patients showing variants classi ed as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, in at least two different genes, and data (at least partly) compa- tible with phenotype and known inheritance pattern for their disease, were reassessed. Five patients had two geneticconditions: two dominant diseases were found in 3 cases; 2 patients had an autosomal recessive and a dominant disease. Though parental studies were not possible for all cases, ofnote is that 2 patients had de novo variants occurring in two different gene-pairs: HUWE1 and CHAMP1 ,a n d SETD5 and KIF21A . Frequency of the blended (overlapping or combined) phenotypes was ~0.67% in our cohort ( n=743). This work further expands knowledge and need for awareness about such conditions in a diagnostic setting. J. Parente-Freixo: None. J. Oliveira: None. R. Quental: None. P. Silva: None. S. Sousa: None.

P16.08.B Transcriptomic changes of cell-free RNA in plasma with different blood storage times and temperaturesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 615J. Sun1,2, W. Wang2 1BGI Education Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen 518083, China,2BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen 518083, China,3Obstetrics Department, Shenzhen Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China Introduction: Cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma can serve as potential biomarkers for detecting and monitoring diseases. However, the transcriptomic pro le of cfRNA is impacted by the delay before blood fractionation. Yet no study has eval-uated systematically the in fluence of blood storage condition on the expression of cfRNA in plasma. Materials and Methods: We collected fresh blood samples from four healthy subjects. After allowing blood samples to stand at room temperature (RT) and 4\u00b0C for various times (0h, 2h, 6h and 24h), separatedand sequenced by PALM-seq, an integrated sequencing method for cell-free long and small RNA. Then, the expressions of cfRNA were quantitated andcompared with the expression at 0h. Results: Differential expression analysis reveals that the storage time in fluenced the transcriptomic pro le with increasing signi cantly changed genes. The effects were noted after blood stored for 24h at 4\u00b0C and for 6h at RT. Moreover, blood stored at RT has a greater impact on theexpression of cfRNA than stored at 4\u00b0C. Most of the up- regulated genes of 24h are monotonically increasing over time, while down-regulated genes of 24h are fluctuating. Compared with lncRNA and mRNA, miRNA is more stable and has a higher Pearson correlation with the expression at 0h. Conclusions: Our study depicts the changes of cfRNA transcriptomic pro le in different blood storage times and storage temperatures, and provides relevant research with alist of genes whose expressions are sensitive to blood storage conditions.

Pocernich2 1Agilent Technologies, Technologies, Ankeny, IA, United StatesIntroduction: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) plays an emerging role as source for potential new biomarkers. However, cfDNA still represents a demanding sample type due to restricted abundance and complex fragment size distribu- tion. Standardizing and monitoring pre-analytical para- meters, including cfDNA extraction, is inevitable to achievebest possible sample quality and yield. Materials and Methods: CfDNA was extracted with nine different kits and then analyzed with an electrophoreticassay tailored for cfDNA analysis. The assay provides quantitative results for total DNA as well as cfDNA separated from high molecular weight (HMW) DNA. Thequality score %cfDNA is provided as additional quality parameter, determining the percent cfDNA of total DNA in presence of HWM DNA. This set of quality parametersadjusted to the needs of cfDNA characterization was applied to compare the extraction kits. Results: The nine cfDNA extraction kits varied in rate of yield and their size selection capacity to remove HMW DNA. In general, each kit afforded either superior yield or high selectivity towards cfDNA. Conclusions: High yield may be crucial for plasma with low cfDNA content, yet if the plasma is expected to contain considerable amounts of HMW DNA, theselectivity towards cfDNA might be favored. Even if no preference for a single kit could be established, the results present a straightforward way to monitor the impact ofpre-analytical parameters on cfDNA yield and quality. Automatic evaluation of a qua lity score for cfDNA allows to de ne a threshold for objective sample quality assessment. E. Graf: A.

For that aim, we com- pared exome CNV calling results of 45 individuals with results of CMA analysis. The samples belong to the patientswith developmental delay/intellectual disability with or without additional abnormalities for whom no pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were reported by CMA and hence,they underwent exome trio testing. The CMA analysis identi ed 64 regions overlapping with coding regions, but 27 of them were designated as CMA artifacts. The remain-ing 37 CMA regions (in 27 samples), included 11 deletions (average 537Kbp), and 26 duplications (average size 665Kbp). Exome sequencing was performed followingenrichment with TWIST Human Core Exome plus kits (average coverage >250x). Exome-CNV calling was exe- cuted using default parameters of DRAGEN Ver. 3.4.14based on read-depth method. In the current methodology, 33 out of 37 (89%) regions reported by CMA were successfully identi ed by the Exome-CNV calling. The remaining 4 regions were duplications in size ranging between 256Kbp- 890Kbp. In addition, Exome-CNV calling identi ed at least 150 more high-quality CNV regions not reported by CMA,and also encountered a large number of false positives. We concluded that default parameters of DRAGEN CNV calling for exome samples should be optimized to increase theaccuracy and reduce the number of false positives in order to make it comparable with CMA analysis.

Castejon-Fernandez , Bravo-Alonso, R. de Madrid, Madrid, Spain Recent developments in high-throughput sequence capture have made next generation sequencing (NGS) of routine usewhen making genetic diagnoses. Improvement of the depth of coverage allows for the detection of large genomic deletions in addition to single nucleotide variations (SNVs),although further validations are needed for an accurate diagnosis. The present study proposes a bioinformaticpipeline to exploit the potential use of the NGS to detect CNV in addition to SNVs. This work includes genetic analysis of 21 unsolved cases with suspicion of metabolic disorders. We have used two NGS panels for genetic studies: a targeted exome [Illumina] on a rst step of annotation of SNVs and a second step -if necessary- of CNVs analysis using an algorithm based package modi ed in-house, combined with post-computational lter-selection to reduce false positives. The bioinformatic pipeline allowed the identi cation of eighteen large deletions in 16 different genes, 7 of which were novel. The results of the SNPs arrays studies and/or long range PCR analysis showed that a high number ofgenomic rearrangements detected involved Alusequences. Two cases showed Aluinsertion that was not detected by either panel due to the incorrect alignment. These results show that the NGS can detect genomic rearrangements plus SNVs with a well-de ned pipeline what reduces the response time in the genetic diagnosis, but other molecular assays are needed for the correct character- ization of them.

P16.15.C Fast, scalable validation of NGS diagnostics using hundreds of clinical samples T. Medina , M. Beukers, P. B. T. Neerincx, K. M. Abbott, B. Sikkema-Raddatz, M. A. Swertz Center Groningen, Groningen, Nether- lands Introduction: High-con dence variant call sets, such as those offered by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, are thecurrent gold standard for evaluating NGS analysis pipelines. Individual samples do not, however, include signi cant numbers of rare or clinically relevant variants. Reanalysis ofin-house samples known to contain such variants comple- ments this de ciency, but is limited by its lack of scal- ability. We present a method for incorporating variant-relevant NGS reads from a multitude of clinical samples into a single hybrid control for ef cient pipeline validation. Materials and Methods: NIST was whole-exome sequenced using a custom GATK-based clinical diagnostic oped VaSeBuilder tool ( https://github.com/molgenis/Va SeBuilder ), sequencing reads aligning in a continuous region around patient variant loci were added to theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 617NA24385 read set. NA24385 reads in the same alignment window were removed. The resulting hybrid set of reads was then routinely added to diagnostic analysis batches as an in silico spike-in control for continuous validation. Results: NA24385 sequencing reads were exchanged with reads representing 1283 clinically relevant autosomalvariant calls from 656 patient WES samples. Of the 1081 SNVs and 202 indels added, 98.8% are recalled in concordance with their original samples. Conclusions: The compilation of an arti cial genome enriched with clinically relevant variants allows for much more ef cient and relevant validation of NGS pipelines than by using high-con dence call sets alone. In addition, this method can be automated and used continuously for routine diagnostic validation with every analysis run.

Rao, S. Gokul , E. Hallmark, C. Parker, D. Patel, B. Hall Asuragen, Inc., Austin, TX, United States Introduction: ECFS practice guidelines recommend detection of at least one abnormal CFTR mutation in >96% Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. ACMG and ACOG guide-lines in the US recommend a targeted CFTR panel of 23 variants. We addressed both European and US recommen- dations with a panel derived from common mutationsindexed in CFTR2 and re flected in the US population using an integrated system of PCR reagents and analysis software. Methods: We developed a prototype, two-tube panel using AmplideX \u00aePCR that genotypes IVS8 electrophoresis (CE) on a 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher). Evaluated samples included synthetic DNA ( n=43) and genomic DNA from cell lines ( n=79), whole blood ( n=300), and residual clinical samples with known pathogenic variants ( n=35). Genotypes were assigned using a sequencing con rmed all variants. Results: The CFTR mutation panel targeted at least one pathogenic mutation in >99% of CF patients, andrepresented 92.6% of variant alleles in the US population. Mutations and zygosity agreed with reference calls for>98% of variants across different samples. Automated software calls agreed with manual calls yet required <100- fold analysis time. Carrier rates for presumed healthy blood donors were compared with published values for the relevant groups. Conclusions: We developed and evaluated a prototype multiplex, allele-speci c PCR/CE system with up-to-date, evidence-based mutation content, a streamlined work flow, and automated software. This system can genotype diversepopulations for CF carrier screening and diagnostics. G. Latham: A. Employment (full or part-time); Sig- nicant; Asuragen, Inc.. E.

Zaouter Devyser AB, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction: Cystic brosis (CF) is a severe genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The identi cation of mutations is a key step in the process of diagnosis and carrier screening. However, the high mutationvariability between different geographical and ethnic populations makes the analysis of the CFTR gene challenging and has a direct bearing on the strategy ofmolecular analysis of CF. Methods: We developed two assays for a multi-level testing strategy that maximizes mutation detection whileminimizing costs. A rst multiplex allele-speci c PCR assay followed by fragment analysis was used to allow the simultaneous detection of the 68 most common Europeanmutations in only two PCR reactions per sample. A second, amplicon-based NGS assay was employed to detect all mutations in exons and flanking intronic sequences of CFTR using one single PCR mix per sample. The performance of these two assays was evaluated by analyzing samples carrying pathogenic mutations that werepreviously characterized using commercially available kits.618 J. del PicchiaPreliminary results: The allele-speci c PCR analysis of 41 samples from Spain carrying a total of 60 mutations revealed that 57 of these mutations were included in our mutation panel and identi ed, providing a high detection rate of 95%. The NGS analysis of 32 samples carrying 116 mutations showed a sensitivity and speci city of >99%, combined with an excellent coverage uniformity of >99.8%. Conclusions: The combination of a fragment analysis assay enabling high mutation detection rate with acomprehensive NGS assay is a cost-effective strategy that is well suited for routine laboratories.

T. den Dunnen3 1CHEO/University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada,2John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHSFoundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom, 3Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands Clear descriptions of clinical and experimental ndings are essential for consistent communication amongst individual scientists, clinicians, and groups. In laboratory genetic stu-dies this has happened through the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) and Human Genome Variation Society (HVGS). The Standing Com-mittee of the ISCN has established a standard system for the description of numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities characterized by various methods. The nextrevision of these standards will be released in 2020, and will address issues raised from members of the cytogenomics community and vetted through the Standing Committee.These include clarity on general principles with more spe- cicd enitions of terms. Improvements to oncology, FISH, microarray region speci c assay nomenclatures will be emphasized. ISCN 2020 will align the rules governing the description of all chromosome abnormalities regardless of technology used. The \"view\"of chromosomes will move from centromere-focused to one based on genomic sequence from pter to qter; sex chromosomes abnormalities will be presented rst followed by those affecting auto- somes for all techniques. Continued improvements and renements to guidelines rst released in 2016 in colla- boration with HGVS will also be included. This new stan-dard combines aspects of both HGVS and ISCN and will meet the needs of both the cytogenomic and molecular communities, making information on both the chromosomaland base-pair level readily evident and providing a con- sistent description of large intra- and inter-chromosomalrearrangements. Elements and examples of these improve- ments to ISCN and the combined standard will be presented to illustrate their utility. J. McGowan-Jordan: None. R.J.

Lombard, A. Krause, the DDD-Africa Study Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Service and School of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg,South Africa Introduction: Latest guidelines for the diagnosis of developmental disorders (DD) suggests exome sequencing as the rst-line investigation, however, the applicability of such guidelines in an African setting is uncertain. Due to thedearth of research into DD in Africa, there is little knowl- edge of the characteristics of the patient cohort with DD and current diagnostic processes. This knowledge is essentialbefore considering implementation of such guidelines. Methods: A clinical le audit was performed on 934 patients presenting to Medical Genetics clinics in Johannes-burg South Africa in 2017. Results: 83% of the patient cohort presented with features of DD with 37% having global developmental delay. Threemain groups of patients were identi ed within the cohort according to their different diagnostic processes. The rst group (18%) with genetically con rmed aneuploidies were often diagnosed by general clinicians before referral. The second group (25%) presented with conditions that were clinically recognisable, by medical geneticists, and soreceived clinical diagnoses with 39% con rmed genetically. The third and largest group (57%) presented with non- specic, unrecognisable conditions. Of these, 92% remain undiagnosed, even after all appropriate available testing. Conclusions: Patients with DD are the largest group of patients seen at this Medical Genetics clinic. Currentdiagnostic testing approaches are limited, so where condi- tions are unclear or unrecognisable, diagnostic yield is very low. Therefore, there is a large cohort of patients whowould bene t from implementation of rst-line exome sequencing, from a time, diagnosis and cost perspective. NIH funding award: U01MH115483. E.K.

Bertoli-Avella1, H. Cheema2, V. Skrahina1, M. Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan,3University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany To establish the genetic diagnosis, and to asses diagnostic yield and clinical impact in patients with no previous accessto genetic testing. We implemented a collaborative diagnostic program in Lahore, Pakistan. Local physicians carefully ascertainedpediatric patients at their departments. More than 1,586 genetic tests were performed in 1,019 individuals consisting of 349 index cases and 670 relatives. Most performed testswere exome/genome sequencing (ES/GS) and speci c gene panels. In 61.3% of the patients ( n=214) a genetic diagnosis was established based on pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants. In 19.8% (69 cases), variants of unknown clinical signicance were reported. Diagnostic yield was higher in consanguineous families. Most identi ed disorders were metabolic diseases corresponding to the main referral clinical department. Furthermore, in 28 patients, geneticdiagnosis relied on additional biochemical testing, which allowed for rapid assessment of the functional effect of the relevant variants. Remarkably, the genetic diagnosis had adirect impact on clinical management in 79.4% of the patients (170/ 214). Most relevant consequences were therapy related decisions such as initiation of the appro-priated treatment in a timely manner (e.g. biotin). Others included referral to other medical specialties and possibility of prenatal/predictive testing. Finally, we report 12candidate genes among 66 cases with no clear genetic diagnosis. Our results emphasize the importance of careful clinical assessment, patient selection and physician-to-lab commu- nication as crucial steps of the diagnostic process. The high diagnostic yield, clinical impact, and relevant researchndings demonstrate the utility of genomic testing, especially when used as rst-line genetic test. A. Bertoli-Avella: A.

CNV con rma- tion and segregation analysis EvaGreen du d\u00e9veloppement, CHU, The use of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) as a diagnostic tool in moleculargenetics has facilitated the identi cation of copy number variations (CNVs). In this study, we present a simple and highly accurate method for CNV con rmation and segre- gation analysis using an efciency and primer concentrations allowing amplicon separation. A gene ratio can then be calculated by absolutequanti cation of events for the target and reference genes with no need of standard curves. For each CNV, we developed a duplex assay with RPP30 as reference gene and designed primers for the target gene with an amplicon size between 100 and 250 bp. In order to more easily separate amplicons, we used 50nM and 150nM for target andreference primers respectively. We compared results obtained from dPCR (DQ) to aCGH (log 2ratio) and qPCR (normalized ratio) from 137 samples (blood, amniotic fluid, chorionic villi).620 J. del PicchiaResults: Our experiments showed that dPCR is a reproducible method with a low variation coef cient (5%). Correlations are equivalent between both molecular method, i.e. dPCR and qPCR, compared to results obtained by aCGH (r\u00b2 =0.964, p=1). Same analytical sensitivity was obtained for experiments from 1.25 to 10 ng DNA bywell, thus allowing sample saving in particular for prenatal diagnosis. Conclusions: This dPCR assay in a single well is a simple, reliable and cost-ef cient method which could be an interesting alternative to relative quanti cation assay as qPCR. E. Sanchez: None. A. M.

Genetic testing is recommended as part of routine clinical practicesince a genetic diagnosis allows con rmation of the clinical diagnosis, ensuring appropriate care and follow up access to personalised treatments, carrier identi cation, and family planning. The advent of next generation sequencing-based diagnostics has prompted the update of testing guidelines, previously published in 2010. The compilation of theserevised guidelines was facilitated by the European Mole- cular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN).We have con- sidered several issues. Technical aspects include variantdetection (including small variants and copy number var- iations); RNA analysis and its use in DMD genetic testing; genotype-phenotype correlation as an implication of genetictesting. Male and female carrier diagnostic flowcharts have been revised with speci c recommendation about known orunknown familial pathogenic variant identi cation. The entire cohort of prenatal diagnostic work flows, including non-invasive foetal sexing and diagnosis (NIPD) and pre- implantation genetic diagnosis are discussed. A section is dedicated to variant annotation, which is of paramount importance for accurate variant reporting. We also providerecommendations on results reporting (in males and car- riers), and interpretation of atypical variants or genomic congurations. We discuss and delineate possible mod- alities of reporting incidental ndings related to the DMD gene analysis. The impact of genetic testing in personalized therapies and clinical trials enrollment procedures is alsodiscussed. Finally we provide recommendations on laboratory settings, including accreditation, ERN network (Euro-NMD) participation, Orphanet platform registrationand participation in quality-assessment schemes.

Hastings3 1Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, Netherlands,2Institute of Human Genetics, University Clinic Jena, Jena, Germany,3GenQA, Oxford University Hospitals Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom Introduction: In a future where Whole Genome Sequen- cing (WGS) will predominate, clinical laboratory geneticists (CLGs) with knowledge about chromosomes will be neededbecause not all clinically relevant chromosomal aberrations can be revealed by WGS. CLGs who specialize in cytoge- nomics are able to recognize when there is a need forcytogenetic follow-up studies after WGS. Here, we present evidence from recent External Quality Assessments (EQAs) that competence in clinical cytogenomics is at risk. Methods: Recent EQAs organized by GenQA were evaluated in which identical critical errors had been made by at least ve participants. We also used public sources about age distributions of CLGs, job opportunities and training programs.Results: We identi ed critical errors at both the analytical and interpretative level that would adversely affect patient management, revealing that, in many laboratories, there is a decit in CLGs with cytogenomic expertise. This may deteriorate further as 25-30% of EBMG-registered CLGs with experience in cytogenetics will retire in the nextdecade. At the same time, trainees entering the eld have a preference for molecular genetics. We show that job opportunities in molecular genetics are in excess over thosein cytogenomics, and that current CLG training programs tend to accommodate less time for cytogenomics. Discussions: Here, we de ne the minimal knowledge a CLG should have about cytogenomics in a world predominated by WGS. We argue that laboratory directors and boards of professional organizations in clinical geneticscan preserve cytogenomic competence by providing adequate CLG training programs and attracting suf cient numbers of capable trainees.

Previous studies on DeepGestalt 's quality focused on its sensitivity in patients with facial dysmorphisms. However, any diagnostic pro- cedure also requires negative testing to determine its accu- racy. We present these systematic tests of DeepGestalt on photographs of healthy individuals and suggest a machine-learning driven approach to infer presence/absence of a syndromic facies from DeepGestalt 's results. Materials and Methods: We collected 19 images for each of 17 distinct syndromes. 323 images of healthy individuals were matched to these regarding age, sex and ethnicity. Altogether, we analyzed 646 frontal photographs.We accessed DeepGestalt (v. 19.1.7) using Face2Gene CLINIC and evaluated results for the suggested diagnoses ' frequencies, ranks and scores. We trained and tested a linearsupport vector machine (SVM) using a leave-one-out scheme to distinguish the two classes of images based on DeepGestalt 's output. Results: We con rm DeepGestalt 's high true positive rate (top-10-sensitivity 91%). Furthermore, false positives showed an interesting distribution. DeepGestalt suggested171 distinct differential diagnoses in the top-10-results lists of the healthy control cohort. Frequencies differed: For example - although known to the system - it never falselysuggested Apert syndrome, while it proposed Fragile X syndrome in 50% of healthy controls. DeepGestalt 's top-1-scores do fairly predict presence/ absence of a facies (AUROC: 0.71). Using a this predic- tion (AUROC: 0.89). Conclusions: Our data facilitate the interpretation of DeepGestalt 's results and may help improve it and similar systems. J.T. Pantel: None. N. Hajjir: None. M. Danyel: None. J. Elsner: None. A.

However, array tech- nology was not developed for low quantity and quality forensic DNA. Here we systematically tested how DNA quantity and quality impacts array-based genotyping accu- racy and consequent success in identi cation of relatives. Methods: We used the Illumina GSA-v2 array for blood DNA with varying degrees of DNA concentration and degradation. We established high-quality reference data, which allowed quantifying genotyping error rate andinvestigating its impact on the success of identifying relatives, simulated from these reference data. Results: Stepwise decrease of DNA quantity from 200 nanogram down to 6.25 picogram led to a gradual decrease in the SNP call rate from 100% to 43%, an increase discordance from 0% to 73% while thehomozygote discordance remained zero down to 250 picogram and then increased to 21%. However, the identi cation rate for relatives remained stable at 100% down to 250 picogram for siblings and 1 stcousins and down to 1 nanogram for 2ndcousins and 3rdcousins, before the identi cation rate decreased to zero at 25 picogram and below. Analyses on arti cially degraded DNA are ongoing and not yet completed. Conclusions: Our study provides the rst empirical evidence on SNP microarray genotyping accuracy in compromised DNA samples and illustrates the consequence of genotyping errors for genetic genealogy. Our results arerelevant for forensic genetic genealogy and any other forensic microarray applications such as appearance prediction and biogeographic ancestry inference. J.H. de Vries: None. D.

Lots of existing tools have been developedto search the semantic similarity in the ontology and achieved high accuracy in the task of gene prioritization by patients 'phenotypic features. However, since the similarity search is biased among diseases of varying prevalences,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 623these tools usually perform poorly on patients with rare diseases. Therefore, we propose Case-Annotation plus Disease-Annotation (CADA), a network-based gene prior- itization method to improve the gene prioritization for rare diseases patients. Materials and Methods: The diagnosed disease, disease- causing gene and phenotypic features of 11,000 patients from the Clinvar and our hospitals are collected. Along with the phenotypic features and their annotated diseases andgenes from HPO, A knowledge graph, incorporating nodes of diseases, genes, patients and phenotypic features as well as their relationships as edges, is prepared. Then node2vecis used for node embeddings generation. With node embeddings, the gene prioritization is achieved by similarity-based node link prediction. Results: The patients with the same disease and disease- causing gene were located in close proximity in node embeddings. Clustering visualization shows that diseaseswith similar phenotypic features tend to cluster together as well. The prioritization of disease-causing gene improved on more than 60% of rare disease patients. Conclusions: By integrating real-world case annotations and existing disease annotations from HPO, CADA provides a new way to address the semantic search biasproblem in existing tools for the gene prioritization of rare disease patients with phenotypic features.

What has to be considered and why it is important T. Eggermann , J. Br\u00fcck, K. Eggermann, I. Kurth, M. Begemann, M. Elbracht Institute of Human Genetics, Aachen, Germany Molecular diagnostic testing of imprinting disorders (ImpDis) is challenging due to the broad spectrum of molecular defects and their mosaic occurrence. Clinically,these entities are heterogeneous as well, and they show a notable phenotypic overlap. However, the precise identi - cation of the type of defect is a prerequisite for the clinicalmanagement and genetic counselling. In fact, the con- tribution of the four major alterations (UPDs, CNVs SNVs, epimutations) varies considerably in the currently knownImpDis. Due to their formation mechanism, epimutations are particular prone to mosaicism, as well as upd(11)pat in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). It is therefore notsurprising that ImpDis are un- and misdiagnosed. We will report on our experience of testing in >1000 patientsreferred for diagnostic testing of BWS and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). Though the majority of patients carried the expected molecular results, we identi ed a considerable number of unexpected alterations, new changes as well as undiagnosed epimutations / UPDs due to extremely dis- crepant mosaic distributions. Additionally, the rate ofmultilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID) and genome- wide uniparental disomies is further speci ed. Altogether, these cases show that comprehensive tests targeting differ-ent tissues and including different methods have to be applied, combined with a thorough clinical examination. The precise molecular diagnosis is required as the basis fora targeted management (e.g. ECG and tumor surveillance in BWS, growth treatment in SRS). For genetic counselling it is needed for recurrence risk estimation which is hinderedby the impact of the spatial arrangements of imprinting elements and their interactions on the phenotype. T.

Comprehensive Cancer Centre (i3s) & Institute of Molecular Pathology Immunology of the University of Porto (Ipatimup), Porto, Portugal,4Depart- ment of Economics and Economic Policies Research Unit(NIPE), University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, 5Faculty of Medicine for diffuse-gastric-cancer(DGC), lobular-breast-cancer(LBC). We present a cost-model spe- cic for HDGC care-pathway demonstrating that enrolment in disease-speci c care-pathways at Expert Centres and adoption of risk-reduction measures is cost-effective andlife-saving. Material and Methods: We calculated costs for optimal HDGC care-pathway in the public Portuguese HealthSystem(PHS); and analysed and nancial records (2008-2018) from structured oncogenetics/high-risk con- sultations from 115 at risk individuals from 7 HDGC- CDH1 families, at a GENTURIS Healthcare Provider Centre. Results: This model predicts that a non-carrier costs 350 \u20ac, being discharged from further follow-up. An (male/female) undergoing RRG costs 14K\u20acthe 1 styear, 160 \u20ac/year the 2 following years and 125 \u20ac/year thereafter. Hospital expenses with female-carriers undergoing RRM is 9K \u20acthe 1styear, 200 \u20acthe following year and 100 \u20ac/year thereafter. Asymptomatic-carriers deciding for surveillance cost 700 \u20ac/year. However, if developing disease (early-detected) during surveillance, cost increases to 15K \u20acfor DGC and 10K \u20acfor LBC in the 1styear, with overall good prognosis. If late-detected during surveillance, prognosis is poor and cost raises the 1styear to 32K\u20acif DGC, 28K \u20acif LBC and 60K \u20acif both. Conclusions: This study, the rst on cost impact of preventive multidisciplinary-care applied to rare-cancer- syndromes performed at a European Reference Centre, shows that prevention/early diagnosis in CDH1 -mutation- carriers is life-saving and considerably less-costly for the PHS than treating patients with expressed disease. *Equal contribution L.

The updated HAE managementguidelines recommend performing genetic tests to reach a precise diagnosis. Unfortunately, genetic tests are still uncommon in the diagnosis routine. Here we characterizedfor the rst time the genetic causes of HAE in individuals from Canary Islands (Spain). Material and Methods: Whole-exome sequencing data was obtained from 35 enrolled patients (21 families) and the results were analyzed with the Hereditary Angioedema Database Annotation (HADA) tool for of prioritized variants according to ACMG guidelines was assessed in those families without knowncausal variants. Results: Three known causal variants were detected in 4 families: rs38940870, classi ed as likely pathogenic, and rs35788383 and rs118204456, classi ed as of uncertain signicance. In two unrelated patients without any described causal variant within SERPING1 orF12,w e detected two novel variants in SERPING1 of uncertain signicance that were manually reclassi ed as likely pathogenic. A total of 17 families (81%) remained withouta genetic diagnosis of HAE based on the current knowledge. Conclusions: All described or novel causal variants found affected SERPING1 andF12genes. However, further in-depth sequence analysis is required to fully describe the genetic variation causing HAE. bureau, expert witness); Modest; Takeda Pharmaceutical A. Mu\u00f1oz-Barrera: I.

Potre1,2, and Pharmacy \"Victor Babes \", Timisoara, Clinic, Municipality Emergency Hospital, Timisoara, Romania,3Hematology Clinic, Timisoara Roma- nia Introduction: Hereditary thrombophilia is a genetic dis- position related to hypercoagulable states generated byacquired conditions of haemostasis; pregnancy changes the haemostatic system into a hypercoagulable state, which increases throughout pregnancy and is utmost arounddelivery [1]. Genetic testing for thrombophilia mutations implies the study through different methodologies of real- time polymerase chain reaction and DNA microarrays ofspecic genes: and Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a group of 40 pregnant caucasian women, diagnosed with hereditary thrombophilia during 2017- 2019, in the west part of Romania, investigated byanalyzing the main thrombo lic gene mutations involved as risk factors in the process of coagulation and of the nucleic acids metabolism. Resuls: The overall relative risk for early pregnancy loss was signi cant increased for the homozygosity of PAI-1 and for the MTHFR mutations (p < 0, 05). We noticed nostatistically relevant association of any of the other tested mutations with early pregnancy loss. Conclusions: The genetic testing for thrombophilic gene mutations as risk factors for recurrent pregnancy loss revealed that the main genes involved in mechanism of hereditary thrombophilia were PAI-1 and MTHFR.

Ellard, E. Baple, C. F. Wright University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom Purpose: Pathogenicity predictors are integral to genomic variant interpretation but, despite their widespread usage, an independent validation of performance using a clinically-relevant dataset has not been undertaken. Methods: We derive two validation datasets: an \"open\" dataset containing variants extracted from publicly-available databases, similar to those commonly applied in previous benchmarking exercises, and a \"clinically-repre- sentative \"dataset panel sequencing. Using these datasets, we evaluate the performance of three recent meta-predictors, REVEL, GAVIN and ClinPred, andcompare their performance against two commonly used in silico tools, SIFT and PolyPhen-2. Results: Although the newer meta-predictors outperform the older tools, the performance of all pathogenicity predictors is substantially lower in the clinically- representative dataset. Using our clinically-relevant dataset,REVEL performed best with an area under the ROC of 0.81. Using a concordance-based approach based on a consensus of multiple tools reduces the performance due toboth discordance between tools and false concordance where tools make common misclassi cation. Analysis of tool feature usage may give an insight into the toolperformance and misclassi cation. Conclusions: Our results support the adoption of meta- predictors over traditional in silico tools, but do not support a consensus-based approach as recommended by current variant classi cation guidelines.

Mart\u00edn-Arana2,3,4, Research Institute INCLIVA, Spain,2Department of Medical Oncology, Biomedical Research and INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain, 4CIBERONC, ISCIII Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain Introduction: In colorectal cancer (CRC), liquid biopsies suppose a non-invasive alternative for biomarker identi - cation and minimal residual disease detection. Our aim is to evaluate the potential of a custom gene panel that includesunique molecular identi er technology (UMI) for analysis of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Materials and Methods: Horizon Discovery 's standards HD780 and HD816 simulating cfDNA and plasma patient samples, respectively, were selected for evaluation of 8 mutations at different variant allele frequencies (VAF). 2mlof each HD816 standards were puri ed using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (QIAgen). A custom gene panel of 29 frequently mutated CRC genes was designed forQIAseq technology (QIAgen). cfDNA library was puri ed HD816. HD780 libraries were generated 's instruc- tions, whereas HD816 included modi cations. All the NextSeq platform at >30,000X andprocessed with an in-house pipeline for UMI processing. Results: Coverage with non-duplicated reads (NDR) were proportional to the cfDNA input, up 80ng. Panelsensitivity at 1% with 20ng input and 100% with 40ng or higher input. 3 out of 8 mutations were lost at 10ng. Sensitivity at 0.1% was 25% in 20ng and 40ngcfDNA inputs. Similar sensitivity and non-signi cant variations (P =0.35) in NDR coverage were found between HD816 and HD780. Conclusions: Our panel reaches 100% sensitivity at 1% VAF with cfDNA expected input.

P16.41.B detecting down & fragile X syndromes by using deep machine learning from facial images R. Jafarzadeh-Esfehani 1, M. Mirzaei Fard2, of Medical Mashhad, Iran, Islamic Republic of,2Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Delayed diagnosis of genetic syndromes is an important challenge for health care providers. Among various attempts towards reducing the rate of delayeddiagnosis, using machine learning is considered as a new and rapidly developing solution. In the present study, validation of a new diagnostic algorithm for diagnosis oftwo common genetic syndromes with unique facial phe- notype is discussed. Material and methods: The frontal and lateral picture datasets were gathered from Iranian patients who were diagnosed to have down or fragile X syndromes as well as healthy patients without any genetic syndrome withprominent facial appearance. After processing the pictures, landmark detection, feature extraction, feature selection, and classi cation were performed. Five support vector machine(SVM) Classi er designed for the present study. Each classi er took features of frontal and side view images as input and presented its decision from one of the states asoutput. After implementing all of the classi ers on the input data, true parameters for each category were considered and the input image matched with the category with highercount of true statements. Results: Among 100 syndromic and 200 healthy patients, the accuracy, sensitivity and speci city of the software was calculated as 0.986, 1.000 and 0.961 respectively which was greater than human inelegance for similar pictures. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm using both frontal and lateral picture of syndromic patients can achieve considerable accuracy and can be used as a screening program helping the physiciansin order to detect the genetic syndrome with facial features.

A. S. Devonshire2, C. Mattocks3, 1East Midlands and East of England Genomic Laboratory Hub, Cambridge, United Kingdom,2National Measurement Laboratory at LGC, United Kingdom,3West Kingdom, 4NIBSC, Ridge, United King- dom,5EMQN, Manchester, United Kingdom The quality and comparability of laboratory medicine results underpins accurate diagnosis and disease monitoring in patient care pathways. Measurement uncertainty is thequality metric that informs the testing laboratory and its users about test tness for purpose, whether a result is above or below a treatment threshold and its degree of compar-ability with other laboratories. An ISO15189 laboratory medicine accreditation requirement, the measurement uncertainty of a test is intended to encompass all randomand systematic effects on a measurement result. However current models to assess measurement uncertainty have been developed in the eld of physical measurement or analytical chemistry and do not apply well to clinical genomic tests. Here we describe two new principles to standardise measurement uncertainty evaluation for geno-mic tests: 1) the 'examinand '-a general concept that applies to both qualitative and quantitative properties- is de ned by the genomic target sequence and the source of the sample,2) the combination of type of data output and reported result, which may be qualitative or quantitative, de nes the requirement for the type of analysis. We propose the use ofa structured cause-effect diagram for mapping sources of measurement uncertainty in the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phases, along with standard templatesfor recording sources of uncertainty and their mitigation, in addition to measurement uncertainty calculation when applicable. We propose that using this standardised frame-work to guide laboratories through measurement uncer- tainty evaluation will contribute to improving the quality of genomic results and increasing patient 's safety and equity.

P16.44.B Clinical to whole exome sequencingM. and Medicine), Napoli, Italy Whole exome sequencing (WES) can be considered the test of choice to search for intragenic variants in unex- plained monogenic diseases not caused To verify whether mendeliome (or clinical exome) sequen-cing can be still proven to be useful, we critically eval- uated our experience with 64 patients affected by syndromic conditions that we re likely monogenic in ori- gin. Relevant for this analysis were also the following aspects: 1) planning of new pregnancies; 2) early use of mendeliome sequencing in the diagnostic procedure; 3)parental consent. By mendeliome sequencing, we were able to reach the genetic diagnosis in 15 (23,4 %) cases, of which 8 (53.3 %) had a de novo autosomal heterozygousvariant; 5 (33.3 %) were compound heterozygous or homozygous for an autosomal recessive condition; 2 (13.3 %) had an X-linked condition. Variants were mostly inclasses IV and V. Clinical re-evaluation of patients was crucial for result validati on. We could expand the phe- notypic spectrum of known conditions in 30% of cases.Prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies was con- sistently performed in several occasions. By WES, pre- cision diagnosis was expanded to three genes not includedin the mendeliome. By contrast, a high number of VUS was observed, for which additional research activities were required and planned. The use of mendeliomesequencing as an early step of the diagnostic work flow, critically oriented on the basis of the clinical phenotype, has proven ef cient also in terms of cost/bene t.

Honeychurch1, J. S. M. Williams1 1Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Bristol, United Kingdom, 2Clinical Genetics, University Hospitals Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom High throughput sequencing in clinical diagnostics gen- erates many genetic variants that require interpretation. A proportion of these affect mRNA splicing, and a range of in silico tools are employed to predict their effect, however these are limited in scope and may be unreliable. Evaluation of splicing variants using targeted RT-PCR is useful to demonstrate functionality. The implementation of a func-tional splicing service at Bristol Genetic Laboratory has demonstrated high clinical utility as complementary approach to support ACMG classi cation (code PS3), to deliver additional positive diagnoses, and to provide further information into underlying disease mechanisms. RT-PCR investigation was utilised in a cohort of ten index patientsfrom different disease backgrounds, using peripheral blood or skin broblasts. In eight patients (80%) the investigated variant demonstrated a splicing effect. Notable examplesinclude: (i) ANKRD11 c.744G>A, p.(Trp202Glyfs*99) resulting in exon 7 skipping and causing loss of a critical D- box sequence, compatible with a diagnosis of KBG syn-drome.

P16.48.C How SMRT sequencing can improve the prognosis and genetic counseling in DM1 patientsS. Tom\u00e9 1, Menlo Park, CA, States,3Molecular genetic laboratory, Necker Hospital, Paris, France Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) results from the expansion of an unstable CTG repeat that usually increases across generations and over time in somatic tissues. CTG repeat instability and DM1 clinical manifestations depend on thelength of the repeat itself and the purity of the repeated sequence. The genetic counseling in DM1 is very complex, due to the highly variable clinical presentation and technicaldifculties in determining the size and purity of the CTG expansion. We used Single Molecule Real-Time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Paci c Biosciences (PacBio) to pre- cisely measure large CTG repeat size and identify sequence interruptions of expanded allele to understand clinical and genetic variability in DM1 patients. We sequenced 10 DM1patients with CTG repeat expansion ranging from 130 to > 1000 CTG repeats on the Sequel System. We ampli ed expanded alleles by PCR and pooled samples equi-mass forlibrary construction, using 10 ng per sample. Selective AMPure puri cation was done to enrich for expanded alleles. We obtained more than 77% full DM1 reads per sample, with>70% of the reads from expanded alleles. The data includes long reads in the expected size range for all samples, including DM1 patients with more than 1000 CTG repeats.SMRT sequencing is very promising to sequence large triplet repeat expansions and also to identify CTG repeat interrup- tions and estimate somatic mosaicism in DM1 patients. Thismethod can improve the prognosis and counseling offered to patients. This work was supported by Pac bio and the Asso- ciation Institut de Myologie. S. Tom\u00e9: None. J. Ziegle: None. Y.

Blok1 1Department of Clinical Genetics, Maastricht University Medical Center +, Maastricht, Netherlands,2Centre for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent,BelgiumAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 629Introduction: the NF1 gene, about 30% 10% are missed by conven- tional DNA-diagnostics, because they are located outside the region of interest, or are misinterpreted by in silico splicing predictions. We designed a targeted RNAseq-basedapproach to detect pathogenic RNA-splicing and thereby causative DNA-variants. Methods: NF1 RNA-seq. An in-house developed tool (QURNAS) was used to calculate an enrichment score (ERS) for each splicing event. A high enrichment scoreindicates high abundance of a potentially pathogenic splicing event. Results: A validation was rst performed with nine known pathogenic NF1 splice-variants and two wildtype NF1 samples. All normal reference exon-exon splice junctions, several novel and 16 out of 17 previously reportednaturally occurring splice events were detected. Further- more, all expected pathogenic splice events were detected based on high ERS. Next, we blindly replicated themolecular diagnosis (based on RT-PCR) of ten patients from Ghent. Since using our approach all pathogenic splicing events and corresponding splice-variants weredetected. Additionally, using RNAseq we identi ed a de novo deep intronic pathogenic splice variant in a patient with a clear NF1 phenotype, whom lacked a molecular diagnosis. Conclusions: Targeted NF1 RNAseq can be successfully used to characterize variants of unknown signi cance (VUS) and identify undetected pathogenic RNA-splicingvariants, additionally to DNA-based diagnostics.

P16.51.C Sample identity quality control in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) routine diagnostics using KASP F. Scharf , Abicht, E. Holinski-Feder Medical Genetics Center MGZ, Munich, Germany The parallel processing of multiple samples in NGS appli- cations requires the exclusion of possible sample swaps. We present a QC approach based on the genotyping of Kompetitive Allele Speci c PCR (KASP) technology and the comparison to NGS data for the veri cation of sample identities. 16 SNPs covered in our NGS capture kit (Agilent SureSelectXT)were selected. To reliably detect sample swaps, 1) haplo- type overlaps between samples need to be excluded, i.e. no sample has been pooled twice (uniqueness) and 2) the identity of each sample needs to be con rmed by comparing KASP and NGS data. Due to possible dropouts or erroneous KASP results, some comparisons might not always bepossible. The minimal number of successful comparisons and maximum number of mismatches for reliable conclu- sions was calculated. Concerning uniqueness, the prob-ability of encountering two samples with the same haplotype over a certain number of SNPs in a certain number of samples was calculated; the cutoffs for identityconrmation are based on the probability of a sample showing one speci c haplotype over a certain number of SNPs. Results showed that at least two differing SNPs in all pairwise comparisons of the samples exclude overlaps with >99% certainty.

To bene t the largest number of patients and researchers, SLIMamp library prep was made compatible with multiple sequencing platforms that are commonworldwide including the MGISEQ. Materials and Five CNV,multi-cancer cfDNA, lung fusions, and lung and colon cancer) on the MGISEQ-2000. Libraries were prepared and sequenced by two laboratories (Zhengu and MGI). 14 CRCsamples were tested and compared on the MGISEQ-2000630 J. del Picchiaand NextSeq CN500 platforms. Automated library prepara- tion by the MGISP-100 was also evaluated. Results: Across the ve assays, mapping and on-target rates and coverage uniformity at 0.2x of the mean demonstrated high performance (generally >95%). Variant calls from 14 CRC samples for the ONCO/Reveal Multi-Cancer Panel sequenced on the 30 demonstrated high performance when sequenced on MGISEQ-2000 andIllumina platforms. Automated library preparation utilizing the MGISP-100 reduced hands-on time while providing sensitive and robust performance.

P16.54.C Robustness and accuracy validation of fetal fraction estimates in NIPT I. Miceikaite , C. Brasch-Andersen, C. Fagerberg, M. J. Larsen Department of Clinical Genetics, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark Introduction: Fetal fraction (FF) is the proportion of total cell-free DNA present in the maternal plasma that is of fetal origin. Suf cient amount of fetal DNA is crucial to avoid false negative NIPT results. Accurate and robust methods toestimate fetal fraction are therefore essential to ensure a valid NIPT result. To what extent the total number ofsequencing reads in fluence the fetal fraction estimate is unexplored. In this study, we tested the robustness of the widely used SeqFF method to provide recommendations on the optimal number of reads needed to obtain accurate fetal fraction estimates. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data from WGS NIPT samples ( n=516) obtained as a part of our local prenatal screening program (Department of Clinical Genet- ics, OUH, Denmark) were included. For all samples >30M(million) reads had been obtained. Data were randomly down-sampled before estimating the fetal fraction and results were compared with SNP-based and chrY-based FFestimates. Results: Overall, =0.88) and chrY-based (R- squared =0.92) methods. By down-sampling, we observed that the SeqFF estimates were highly affected by the total number of reads used. Accurate SeqFF estimates were achieved using >10M reads. By increasing the number of reads further, additional gain in accuracy was observed. Including more than 20M reads did not result in furthersignicant improvement. Conclusions: FF estimation is highly affected by the total number of reads used. It is recommended to use no less than10M reads to obtain accurate FF estimates for NIPT. I. Miceikaite: None. C. Brasch-Andersen: None. C. Fagerberg: None. M.J. Larsen: None.

Solutions, San Jose, CA, United States,2Roche Sequencing Solutions, Inc., Pleasanton, CA, United States Introduction: Clinical implementation of a complex molecular test such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing for fetal trisomy requires extensive validation; however, for most commercially available cfDNA tests there is littlepublished performance data beyond the establishment of sensitivity and speci city. The objective of this study was to assess the repeatability of results for a prenatal cfDNA test. Materials and Methods: The Harmony \u00aeprenatal test on the Ariosa Cell-Free DNA System (CE-IVD) was assessed across multiple lots of reagents and operators. Panels werecontrived from genomic DNA to generate suf cient replicates to assess repeatability across multiple factors. This resulted in a robust sample size of 1,710 samples withfetal fractions re flecting those observed in a general pregnancy population.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 631Results: Overall 97% of samples met the test 's quality control thresholds. Sensitivity was 100% for trisomy 21 (1,034/1,034). (100%) in agreementbetween the lots for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and monosomy X. Sensitivity for 22q11.2 deletion in the 3 lots was notsignicantly different The study demonstrated high sensitivity and speci city with repeatable results over different lots, with operators, runs, and days.

P16.56.B Development of matched maternal-fetal non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) reference materials compatible with a broad range of assay methods A. M. Caruso 1, F. L. Gaithersburg, MA, United States Introduction: The availability of appropriate reference materials that mimic the characteristics of clinical samples for pro ciency testing, assay validations, and run controls is very limited. Seracare has developed a new technology and formulation to provide a sustainable source of patient-like NIPT reference materials. These materials are compatiblewith a broad range of NIPT assay methods and should enable clinical labs to validate and monitor NIPT assays. Methods: Antepartum and postpartum samples were obtained from patients with high-risk pregnancies under IRB approved protocols. ccfDNA was isolated fromante- and post-partum samples. This isolated ccfDNA ampli ed, encapsulated by a proprietary lipophilic proce- dure and blended into a synthetic plasma to create patient- like samples. Results: These new NIPT reference materials demon- strated patient-like fragment distribution (for both maternaland fetal sizing) with a major peak of around 160-170 bp and minor peaks above 250 bp. The materials have been extensively tested by multiple commercial NIPT assays,such as Harmony (Ariosa), VeriSeq (Illumina) or Panorama (Natera). The trisomy 21 and 18 were called accurately as male or female trisomy 21 and female trisomy 18 at fetalfractions of 11%, 13%, and 18% respectively. We also created an aneuploidy negative control - female and male euploid material with fetal fractions at 16.6% and 9.4%. Conclusions: The SeraCare portfolio of NIPT materials with patient-like sample attributes are suitable for a broad range of currently available NIPT methods. The availabilityof matched fetal-maternal reference materials is particularly important for the transition of NIPT into mainstream clinical practice. A.M. Caruso: A. part-time); Signi Seracare.

Children born with PKU, thanks to the newborn screening and early dietary inter- ventions, can have relatively normal lives. The diet allows them to keep Phe level in range. The best indicator of dietary compliance is regular monitoring of Phe con- centrations by using a Liquid Chromatography (LC) basedprocedure. We developed a qualitative chemometric model able to separate PKU patients based on their response to the diet in three different categories: Low (<2 mg/dl), Com-pensate spectroscopy. Methods and Results: A qualitative chemometric model was elaborated using 3000 NIR spectra, from 562 DBS PKU samples from the three different groups, based on their Phe levels assessed by LC. Using a sensor calibrated in theNear infra-Red spectrum, 20 scans per sample in duplicate were acquired. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted. The chemometric model was validated by blindexternal procedure. Our model is able to correctly assign unknown sample to the Low, Compensate, or High group with a linearity of 0,91 and a =0,078, showing a sensitivity ratio between the number of the correctly classi ed samples (CCS) and the number of the known samples belonging to each class (KS): Sn =CCS 100KS close to 100%.

Materials and Methods: Analysis of CNVs in 15q11- q13 D15S1002 The STR markers were selected according to their highheterozygosity and location in the region adjacent of PWS and AS loci. Results: The STR markers genotyping in the analyzed groups revealed 4 PWS patients with maternal UPD15 (iso- and heterodisomic). Three PWS and one AS 15q11- q13 deletions: paternal del 15q in PWS and maternal del15qin AS patients. The maternal age of UPD15 patients was signicantly higher (40,3years) than in mothers of del15q patients (28,4 years). In two AS-like patients with seizures15q11-q13 duplication was detected, one dup15q was inherited from the effected mother and another one was a de novo maternal mutation.

The parent-of-origin speci c expression of these genes is regulated by an imprinting centre. The molecular defects include large deletions of 5-7 Mb, uni-parental disomies, imprinting defects (ID) with or without imprinting centre deletions, mosaic IDs, point mutationsAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 633and deletions of the UBE3A gene as well as rare chromo- somal rearrangements. Given the broad nature of the underlying molecular causes and the different techniques needed to establish the molecular genetic diagnosis and hence the recurrence risk, diagnostic of PWS and AS is challenging. Furthermore, there is increasing need forproper, universally understandable and standardised diag- nostic reports. In the light of improvements and new developments regarding techniques and differential diag-noses together with reporting standards we updated the best practice guidelines for the PWS and AS diagnostics.

Genetic pathology reports can be dif-cult to understand, and need to be easily understood by healthcare providers so they can be used to improve patient outcomes. Additionally, a new, national health e-resourcenow allows patients to independently access their own pathology results, including genetic results in some jurisdictions. Methods: A multi-disciplinary working party was convened. Example reports and literature were reviewedthrough different lenses. Membership comprised general practitioners, a surgeon, clinical geneticist, genetic coun- sellor, genomic scientist and genetic pathologists. Flesh- Kincaid and were used to analyse report readability. The Australian Genomics Community Advisory Group reviewed the model factsheet and recommendations. Results: The level of information that requestors wanted in reports was different, with more detail requested by genetic professionals. All wanted a clear summary of thendings, with a standardised, consistent order of report elements. Readability was identi ed as a major issue. Plain language is important, but accuracy of genetic informationmust be retained in line with accreditation guidelines. Recommendations were formulated and included a model laboratory report template and model report interpretationfact sheet for primary referrers. Conclusions: Laboratories reporting genomic tests should simplify their reports as much as possible. Synopticreporting for genomic tests should be encouraged.

Dunon J. exome (WES) and gen- ome sequencing (WGS) are routinely performed. However, library preparations are complex and laborious, and prone to sample mix-ups. Here, we developed and validated an easyand cost-effective sample identity test for independent genotyping of 44 SNPs and 6 gender markers. Methods: Target SNPs were selected based on their minor allele frequency, exonic location and overlap with the capture region of various WES enrichment kits. For compatibility with FFPE DNA and cfDNA samples, short60-100 bp amplicons were designed. Library preparation is achieved by a limited-cycle indexing PCR step on universal tails incorporated in the target-speci c primers. We applied this novel Human Sample ID Kit on 3 FFPE samples, 1 cell- free reference DNA and 6 GiB reference DNA samples with634 J. del Picchiainput amounts ranging from 1 upto 20 ng. Performance was evaluated by paired-end sequencing on MiSeq instrument. Results: Excellent homogeneous coverage and on-target specicity was achieved. For all DNA samples, all SNPs displayed a coverage higher than 20% of the mean and a mean on-target rate of 94.3%. More impressively, 93.2% ofthe SNPs had a uniform coverage within 2-fold of the mean. Based on the resulting genotypes, DNA samples could be unambiguously discriminated and linked to the correspond-ing exomes. Conclusions: We developed and validated a novel sample tracking test for WES and WGS, involving aready-to-sequence 2-step multiplex PCR reaction. The Human Sample ID Kit has a discrimination power of over 1:85,000 and enabled unambiguous discrimination of eachDNA sample. V. Dunon: A. Employment (full or part-time); Signi - cant; pxlence bvba.

Madrid, Spain, MADRID, Spain, 2Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain, MADRID, Spain Introduction: As it has already been reported, Sanger sequencing validation appears to have limited utility for good quality single nucleotide variants (SNVs) NGS- detected. However, more studies are needed for indelsvariants and/or copy number variations (CNVs).We present the largest single-center Sanger validation study, with a subset data of clinical exomes in 825 characterized cases, inorder to con rm the high concordance expected of our clinical exome diagnostic tool. We also aim to expand the validations of our small deletion/duplication variants andCNVs detected by NGS.Materials and Methods: Clinical exomes were analysed from peripheral blood samples using the TruSight One Sequencing panel (Illumina) or the Clinical Exome Solution (Sophia Genetics). A total of 1099 good quality NGS- detected variants (>20X coverage, >20% heterozygosity and Quality =PASS) 30 were further con rmed by Sanger sequencing and MLPA or array-CGH according to convenience, respectively. Sequencing primers were designed manually or with the ExonPrimer tool, andchecked in the SNPchecker program. Results: Though 11 Sanger discrepancies that required new primers designs were found, we had 100% con-cordance 96% for CNVs ( n=30), as we had a false positive deletion in homozygosis. Conclusions: NGS is a robust technique for the detection for good quality SNVs/Indel variants, but validation forCNVs is still necessary. Limitations of Sanger sequencing should always be considered. Each laboratory might stablish their own thresholds before deciding to discontinueSanger con rmation studies. A. Arteche-L\u00f3pez: None. A.

Groningen, Inc., Austin, Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disease that is often fatal before age two. Approximately 95% of cases are caused by homozygousdeletion of SMN1 exon7. SMN2 is a homolog of SMN1 whose copy is inversely correlated with disease severity, making quanti cation of both genes relevant to recent breakthrough treatments. Additionally, detection of three variants - c.*3 +80T>G, c.*211_*212del in SMN1 associated with gene duplication, and c.859G>C in SMN2 linked to reduced disease severity - can improve carrier detection and inform therapy decisions. We evaluated anAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics Interactive e-Posters 635assay that and the three variants in a single PCR reaction. We used the AmplideX\u00aePCR/CE SMN1/2 Plus kit to test over 100 whole blood or cell-line DNA samples. PCR products were separated using Applied Biosystems 3730/3730 xlGenetic Analyzers and analyzed with AmplideX Reporter software.We also compared the included kit calibrator to calibration using samples from each puri cation method. number calls for SMN1 andSMN2 were over 95% concordant with reference method results over multiple runs. Variant calls were 100% concordant for all samples with known geno- types. Performance was similar regardless of calibrationmethod although calibration with puri ed samples reduced variability. The assay accurately and precisely quanti ed exon7 for both SMN1 andSMN2 at or above four copies and detected the three clinically-signi cant variants in under four hours from DNA to genotype.

M. of Manchester, Manchester, United of Southampton, Southampton, United King- dom Background: RNA-seq shows promise as a diagnostic tool to elucidate the effects of genomic variants impacting pre- mRNA splicing. However, it remains dif cult to speculate in which disease and tissue types it may be most bene cial in improving diagnostic yield. We thus aimed to develop a bioinformatics approach for predicting cross-tissue RNA-seq suitability for given disease genes of interest. Methods: To identify characteristics of pathogenic variation, we compared RNA-seq data from patients withknown splicing defects with control individuals from the GTEx dataset across whole blood, lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) and skeletal muscle. We then devised a gene-speci c approach to predict the RNA sequencing depth required to achieve suf cient coverage of transcripts for given diseasegenes. This was applied to all 285 gene panels listed in the Genomics England PanelApp repository. Results: Between 22 and 84 panels were predicted to be amenable to RNA-seq analysis dependent on tissue choice. Diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis showed particular promise as candidates for RNA-seq-based diagnostics, as 37M sequencing reads in LCL-based RNA-seq was predicted sufcient to cover 90% of splice junctions with at least 8 reads in 16 of the 17 panel genes. Conclusions: We present here a bioinformatics frame- work for the prediction of RNA-seq suitability across disease and tissue contexts, which may ultimately facilitatethe appropriate integration of RNA-seq into clinical diagnostic pipelines.

Southampton, United Kingdom,3Exeter Genomics Laboratory, Exeter, United Kingdom,4Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States,5Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Southampton, United Kingdom Introduction: In the setting of single-gene disorders, the high prevalence of variants of uncertain signi cance limits the clinical diagnostic rate of DNA-based sequencingmethodologies. A signi cant proportion of such variants may cause disease through disruption of RNA splicing. We examined the effects on splicing of a large set of variants ofuncertain signi cance clinically ascertained through diag- nostic genetic testing. We also compared the experimentally determined RNA splicing data to bioinformatic predictionsmade by several commonly used splicing tools. Materials and Methods: 257 variants of uncertain signicance were analysed from across three separate laboratories. Blood RNA was collected in PAXgene tubes and targeted RT-PCR was undertaken with agarose gel636 J. del Picchiaelectrophoresis and Sanger sequencing analysis of products. 17 samples also underwent RNA sequencing of total RNA with depletion of globin mRNA and rRNA. Targeted analysis of splicing was performed on RNA-seq data using Sashimi plot visualisation. Alamut, HSF 3.1 and software predictions. Results: 85/257 (33%) of analysed variants were found to affect splicing. Skipping of the upstream exon was the most frequent abnormality (39/85) and this was most often seenin association with variants within the splice donor region. SpliceAI had an accuracy of 0.91 and outperformed other prediction tools in terms of sensitivity and speci city. Conclusions: Analysis of splicing from blood RNA is useful in identifying splicing abnormalities that cannot reliably be predicted from DNA sequence alone. Thisprovides functional evidence of effect in a signi cant proportion of uncertain variants, helping in A. Gunning: None. H. Kelly: None. P. Cibin: None. E.G. Seaby: None. K. Spiers-Fitzgerald: None.

Vergani1, Biomedical Experimental and Clinical Sciences \"Mario Serio\", University of Florence, F,Florence, Italy, 2Medical Genetics Unit, Meyer Children 's University Hospital, Florence, Italy,3Integrated Unit of Medical Genetics, USL Toscana Centro, Florence, Italy The recent availability of whole exome/whole genome sequencing has led to the characterization of the molecularbasis of an increasing number of craniosynostosis, although there is still little information about isolated trigonocephaly. It usually occurs sporadically and results from the pre-mature closure of the metopic sutures with consequent deformation of the anterior calvarium. We describe two patients (a female and a male) with isolated trigonocephaly.WES disclosed in both cases a mutation in the PTCH1 gene: a de novo heterozygous frameshift variant in the female and a heterozygous stop (inherited from the fatherlater discovered to be affected) in the male. Mutations in PTCH1 have been found to cause Gorlin syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiplebasal cell odontogenic keratocysts, skeletal anomalies, macrocephaly, dysmorphisms and an increasedrisk of tumors in early infancy. Skeletal anomalies with defects in the shape of the skull, ribs and spine are often described, but clinical data do not refer speci cally to the presence of trigonocephaly which instead is frequently reported in patients with 9q22.3 deletion. PTCH 1, included in the region, is the only gene for which the deletion isknown to represent most of the features of patients with this rearrangement. Our report reinforces the clinical utility of WES even in apparently non-syndromic trigonocephaly: infact, the early diagnosis of PTCH1 variants allowed us the early diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome with consequent prompt surveillance, since approximately 5% of all children withvariants in this gene develop medulloblastoma.

Several reports showed that HbA1c wasmore stable indicator of diabetes than blood glucose, since HbA1c level depicts the average of blood glucose in 2-3 months. However, it has not been critically tested whethergenetic predisposition to glycation differs among indivi- duals, which would alter the HbA1c levels given the same glucose levels. To answer this question, we here investi-gated ~270K individuals with 1,892 cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in UK Biobank for the blood glucose and HbA1c, and their associated single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs). We discovered that 2,349 SNPs were associated only with HbA1c level (dubbed as glycation SNPs), while 2,407 and 720 lead SNPs were associated with HbA1c andglucose, respectively. These glycation SNPs were related to genes such as SPTA1, SPTB, and ANK1, indicating theirAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 637functional implication on glycation. We genic risk score (PRS) from the glycation SNPs, which performed as an indicator of the deviated HbA1c levels given the same glucose level across different individuals. In addition, we categorized individuals into several groups along with the PRS, and showed that those groups shouldhave different criteria of HbA1c level to maintain equiva- lent sensitivity and precision of diabetes diagnosis.

P16.77.B Applying PP1 to variants where internal cosegregation data exists at CHEOGenetics Diagnostic Laboratory L. Little , L. Bronicki, O. Jarinova, A. Smith, L. Huang, CHEO, Ottawa, ON, CanadaIntroduction: The \"PP1\"variant classi cation criteria created by the American College of Medical Genetics andGenomics (ACMG) and Association of Molecular Pathol- ogy (AMP) can be used as supporting, moderate or strong level of evidence towards pathogenicity if a variant cose-gregates with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene de nitively known to cause the disease. Appli- cation of PP1 has improved the quality of variant inter-pretation if evidence towards cosegregation exists in the literature. However, the CHEO Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory does not currently apply PP1 when cosegrega-tion of a variant is observed in a family tested internally. Several obstacles were identi ed in implementing the use of PP1 for internal data, including the statistical evaluation ofcosegregation, which is not easily computable by most laboratory personnel. Therefore, a protocol was designed to address these obstacles and create a standardized process. Materials and Methods: Speci c cutoffs for pathogeni- city were chosen, as informed by Jarvik et al. (2016). A retroactive chart review was performed on variants where2 family members were tested internally. PP1 was applied when appropriate. Preliminary Results: PP1 was applied to 3/3 likely pathogenic (LP) variants and 7/11 variants of uncertain clinical signi cance (VUS). Of these, all LP variants were upgraded to pathogenic and 5 VUS 's were upgraded to likely pathogenic. Conclusions: Using a standardized protocol for applying PP1 when evidence of cosegregation exists internally hasimproved the overall quality of variant interpretation atCHEO Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory, and can alter clinical management for patients and their families.

Virtual gene panels for speci c clinical indications improve the ef ciency of genomic analysis, yet there is wide variability in the processes for panel creation and maintenance, and in panel content. Methods: PanelApp is an open platform for virtual gene panel curation that captures structured gene-disease validity assessments, with evidence thresholds governing geneinclusion in panels. Developed by Genomics England for the 100,000 Genomes Project, it is now used by the NHS Genomic Medicine Service, and has been deployed byAustralian Genomics for use by Australian diagnostic laboratories. We have established a collaboration to enable technical co-development and systematic comparison ofvirtual panels between the two PanelApps, sharing expert reviews to accelerate discordance resolution.638 J. del PicchiaResults: Of the 511 virtual gene panels in the two PanelApps, 79 panel pairs cover directly comparable clinical indications; 182 panels are partially comparable; 171 panels are unique. Of the rst 20 panels compared, 709 discrepant genes were identi ed. Sharing expert reviews has resulted in inclusion of 285 new genes for diagnostic use,and removal of 186, with curation ongoing. Common reasons for discrepant gene ratings include differences in panel scope de nition; differential weighting of functional evidence; and challenges in systematic timely identi cation of new evidence establishing or refuting gene-disease associations. Conclusions: We have accelerated improvements in evidence-based diagnostic genomics in two healthcare systems through a federated open platform that supportsshared expert curation of virtual gene panels, while retaining separate governance.

Wen-Jing2 1School of Future Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China,2BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China,3Obstetrics Department, Shenzhen Mater- nity and Child Healthcare Hospital, Shenzhen, China Introduction: Transcriptome levels of white blood cells (WBCs) play an important role in disease diagnosis, prog- nosis and biomarker discovery research. Peripheral blood isusually collected and treated for further experiments, but the effect of storage conditions on WBCs transcriptome remains largely unknown. Methods: Blood samples from healthy donors were drawn into EDTA tubes and stored at both 4\u00b0C and room temperature(RT, 18-22\u00b0C) for 0h, 2h, 6h and 24h. Total cellular RNA was extracted from WBCs after red blood cells lysis, and transcriptome pro les were assessed by RNA sequencing. Results: Compared with samples treated immediately, the proportion of neutrophils decreased, but that of T cells increased in the samples stored at RT for 24h. Samplesmaintained at 4\u00b0C were less in fluenced than that at RT within 24h. We identi ed 1428 up-regulated and 86 down- regulated genes at 4\u00b0C, while there were 4493 genes up-regulated and 5982 genes down-regulated at RT. Up- regulated genes at 4\u00b0C were mostly related to HDACs deacetylate histones, and that at RT were mostly related tomRNA processing. Genes down-regulated at RT were mostly due to leukocyte activation involved in immune response. Reference genes such as CHMP2A and PSMB4were relatively stable, while the expression of IL1RN, which was similar in both men and women, increased more in women than men after 24h stored at RT. Conclusions: We provide a full-scale ex vivo change of WBCs expression pro les, and suggest that these in fluences should not be ignored in relative studies.

HPO terms were collected prior to analysis. Over 35,000 families have been analysed using this approach. Methods: Using >950 con rmed genetic diagnoses in patients with intellectual disability, we modelled the outcome of different strategies for automated prioritisation and manual review, focused on diagnostic sensitivity. Results: 87% of genetic diagnoses were prioritised using a single gene panel selected for the original diagnostic hypothesis. The primary reason for non-prioritisation wasthat the causative gene was in a different panel; sensitivity increased to 92% using automated HPO-based rules to apply additional panels. Neuromuscular disorders (analysed with smaller phenotype-speci c panels) gave a panel-based yield of 38%, increasing to 71% with one broad panel. Diagnoses of metabolic and mitochondrial conditions, some treatable, were made where these conditions were compatible with the phenotype data but outside the genepanel for the primary diagnostic hypothesis. Of the 13% with non-prioritised diagnoses, 72% were trios or larger family structures; we will discuss the impactof family structure on diagnostic yield. For families where trio testing is not possible, phenotype- based variant ranking algorithms such as Exomisercontribute. Conclusions: No single analysis strategy can identify all diagnoses. Collecting detailed phenotype data at the time oftest initiation permits a multi-faceted strategy combining broad gene panels, bespoke panel assignment, phenotype- based prioritisation, and gene agnostic analysis, to max-imise diagnostic A. or part-time); Signi cant; Signi cant; Genomics Signi cant; Genomics Signi cant; Genomics Bleda: Signi cant; Gen. cant; Signi cant; Signi cant; Genomics Signi cant; cant; Genomics Genomics of Whole Genome Sequencing for NHS England 's Geno- mic Medicine Service D.

While developing the new WGS pipeline as part of a new genomic medicineservice for England 's National Health Service, we validated the variant detection of other diagnostically important classes of variants. Materials and Methods: The detection of diagnostic variants was assessed using genome data from 100,000 Genomes project participants with diagnostic variantsdetected and/or con rmed by orthogonal methods. Results: The sensitivity of diagnostic variants detection was as following: de novo STR detection of full expansions in 13 loci reached sensitivity and precision of 100% (CI 88.8-100%, 16 positive and 428 negative controls), however, the sensitivity was tested in controlsidenti ed by the earlier version of the WGS pipeline and conrmed by orthogonal methods, and therefore may be640 J. del Picchiaoverestimated. We further show high reproducibility of CNV and STR calling using 80 monozygotic twin pairs. Conclusions: We show high sensitivity, and, where possible, precision, of our rare disease pipeline to identify clinically relevant variants in families with rare disease. We also present a framework for validation of WGS pipelinesfor clinical service, and highlight the challenges posed by the lack of unbiased truth sets of diagnostically relevant variants. D.

P16.82.A The contribution of whole genome sequencing in establishment of genetic diagnosis in undiagnosedpatients with rare genetic disorders A. Maver , G. Bergant, B. Peterlin Clinical institute for Medical Genomics, Ljubljana, Slove- nia A signi cant proportion of patients with rare genetic dis- orders remain undiagnosed despite comprehensive genetictesting using exome sequencing (ES). It is known that pathogenic genetic variants may reside in non-coding regions or may arise due to mutational mechanisms notdetectable using ES. We therefore aimed to characterize theutility of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in diagnosing exome-negative patients. We performed WGS in a 30 patients with negative ES result and high suspicion of genetic etiology based on one of the following inclusion criterions: (1) observation of multiple affected family members, (2) a speci c diagnosis with high probability of genetic etiology, (3) presence of signi cant blocks of homozygosity, or (4) observation a single pathogenic var- iant in a gene associated with recessive inheritance. Wedeveloped an in-house pipeline for analysis of sequence variation in WGS and have extended it with approaches for analysing structural variation (including translocations andretrotransposition variant effect prediction approaches. Among30 selected patients, we identi ed the molecular cause in 9 (30.0%) using WGS. We detected deep intronic pathogenic variants in 2 patients, a pathogenic promoter variant in 1patient, a small structural variant in 1 patient, a complex rearrangement in 1 patient, a translocation in 1 patient, polynucleotide expansions in 2 patients and a retro-transposition event in 1 patient. The results of our study indicate that WGS may represent a valuable approach to establish a diagnosis in a carefully selected subset ofpatients with a negative ES result. A. Maver: None. G.

Zhang 1,2, J. van der Velde1,2, GoNL consortium, BIOS lands Allele-speci expression (ASE) refers to the imbalanced abundance of allelic copies from one transcript. It is theconsequence of many regulation events such as cis- regulatory variants. Recent studies imply its potential roles in diseases and practical value in genome diagnostics.However, routine genome diagnostics heavily depend on DNA sequencing and usually ignore the regulation of gene expression which can be indicated by ASE. Therefore, awell-developed prediction model is capable to attribute the value of ASE to the successful genome diagnosis. We here report on a deep learning model built to understand how the ASE effects of a transcript associatedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 641with the adjacent regulatory elements using NGS DNA haplotypes obtained from the Genome of the Netherlands project and RNA sequencing results from Biobank-based Integrative Omics Studies. Then, given a transcript, for paternal and maternal alleles, the ASE effects are quanti ed from the RNA sequencing results and potential regulatorysequences are acquired from whole-genome sequencing results. Finally, we are piloting a convolutional neural network, which values the objects in an image-like two-dimension matrix (in our case, it is the regulatory sequence) to distinguish one from the other. We also plan to apply the model on diseases-related genes or transcripts to evaluate itsadded value to the diagnosis. Ideally, the model can contribute to the genome diagnostics and general biological studies by supplying functional interpretation that exploitsexpression evidence.

P17.005.C Conditional estimation of the contribution of genomic annotations to common complex diseases M. Patxot 1, A. Kousathanas1, S. E. Ojavee1, D. Trejo Banos1, M. R. Robinson2 1University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland,2Institute of Science and Techonology Austria, Vienna, Austria Despite efforts to estimate the contribution of genomic regions to common complex trait variation, the distribution of effect sizes across functional annotations remainsunknown. Previous studies estimate enrichment across annotations in a series of follow-up analyses rather than utilizing functional information to assess enrichment con-ditional on the rest of the genome. Here, we introduce a scalable Bayesian model that utilizes genomic annotations and individual-level data to jointlyestimate marker effects while accounting for LD. SNP effects for each annotation group are modelled as a series of normal distributions providing inference on the geneticarchitecture of genomic enrichment. Effect size distribu- tions can be compared across annotations and the genetic variance for each group simultaneously quanti ed. In simulations we demonstrate our method gives unbiased estimates of annotation enrichment under extreme LD scenarios. We apply the model to height, body mass index(BMI), type-2-diabetes (T2D) and coronary artery disease (CAD) in the UK Biobank. We nd a stark contrast between BMI and height: BMI being highly polygenic with tinyeffect sizes located 10 to 1000 kb from exons whereas height shows a variety of effect sizes in coding and non-coding regions. T2D and CAD are highly polygenic and we also observe that promoter regions contribute less than 5% to the phenotypic variance of all four traits. This method provides a full quanti cation of genetic architectures underlying complex traits and determines which genomic regions are in fluential, improving disease risk prediction.

Data analysis and interpretation is one of the main challenges and still many cases remain unsolved. However, scienti c knowl- edge evolves rapidly and periodic data reanalysis has beenshown to increase the diagnostic yield by up to 5-10%.We have reanalysed 7,495 genomic datasets from unsolved rare disease patients and relatives submitted in the context of the\"Solve-RD - solving the unsolve d rare diseases\" project. Data was processed through the RD-Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis combining genomic and clinical data: i) V FPS, a programmatic approach integrated with the GPAP ii) Exomiser, a tool for phenotype- driven prioritisation of variants and iii) CAPICE, a computational method for consequence-agnosticpathogenicity estimation. A consensus output with a minimal set of variant annotations has been de ned for all approaches to further facilitate data interpreta tion and results feedback. Can- didate variants are made available in a secured cloud to clinical researchers of the four participating European Reference Net- works (euro-NMD, ITHACA, RND and GENTURIS) for datainterpretation. Preliminary results on the VFPS approach, where more than 2500 candidate variants from 1700 patients have been returned, already provided diagnosis for 3-8% ofpatients.

Celik1, bul, Turkey,2Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar DETAE, Istanbul, TurkeyOne of the most challenging tasks in the area of clinical genetics is to determine the pathogenicity of genetic varia- tions and provide standardized clinical evaluation for the genetic data. Therefore, we have developed the GenerAVI. v2 tool for the automatic interpretation of bulk variants by American College of Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)criteria. The GeneraAVI.v2 also allows users to make their own interpretation and stores them in a disease-speci c manner. The GenerAVI.v2 is developed using C ++ and Python. The platform uses vcf les as the le input. After preliminary ltering based on quality and previously known false-positive calls, all variants are annotated using EnsemblVariant Effect Predictor. Disease-speci c allele frequency, relative position on the gene, in silico pathogenicity tool metrics, ClinVar records, and more parameters are used forautomated ACMG classi cations. GeneraAVI.v2 tool can automatically evaluate and report all variants detected in terms of 15 known ACMG criteria. It also analyzes bymodied PVS1 criteria which are based on the non- mediated-decay pathway and alternative splicing events. It also allows users to make their own assessments for criteriathat cannot be automated. The tool keeps track of each curation made and uses these evaluations in future analysis. The GenerAVI.v2 tool helps researchers and clinicians toeasily create genetic analysis reports with automated ACMG classi cations and generate dynamic internal fre- quency and clinical interpretation database.

Vabres1,4,5, g\u00e9n\u00e9tique -FHU-Abstracts Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters About 27% of the human genome is com- posed of mobile elements (MEs), which can create genomic instability leading to genetics diseases. The mechanism of LINE1, Aluor SVA insertion has been described in several pathologies. It has been estimated that about 0.3% of all mutations are due to de novo insertion. Nowadays, the mas- sive development of high-throughput sequencing provides theopportunity to MEs insertions on large scale. Methodology: Exome sequencing (ES) data from patients affected with developmental and/or neurologicalabnormalities has been analyzed by MELT, a tool identifying MEs insertions. The results were ltered by frequency, impacted region and gene function. Results: ES data from 3,322 individuals (2,500 probands) were analyzed. 496,312 possible MEs were detected. After ltering, 516 probands with 1,070 rare MEs in non-intronic regions were obtained. Following phenotype comparison and PCR validation, 3 candidates were kept. The most convincing was found in a suspected consanguineous patient referred forpoikilodermia. An homozygous insertion was identi ed in FERMT1 gene involved in Kindler syndrome, a condition belonging to the class of poikilodermia. In two other patients,an exonic and a 3 'UTR insertions were identi ed in 2 genes involved respectively in mental retardation/epileptic encepha- lopathy and epilepsy. RNA-Seq analyzes are ongoing to studytranscriptional consequences. Conclusions: This project aims to identify new insertions in genes and highlight the interest to include MEs detectionin ES pipeline to reduce diagnostic wavering.

Drug-resistant TB is a public health problem in the Kazakhstan and drug susceptibility testingand genotyping methods of M.tuberculosis (MTB) play important role in tuberculosis treatment and control for TB transmission. It is extremely important to determinatesusceptible and resistant strains with different mutations in genes encoding drug metabolism of MTB strains in Kazakhstan. Materials and Methods: The whole genome sequencing data from 8 multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolates of MTB were examined. Results: Known pathogenic and novel variants were found. Genomic variants (SNPs and InDels) speci c/novel variants in drug-resistant genes of MDR strains from Kazakhstan were observed. MDR clinical isolates of the Beijing family and their complete genomes were studied fortherst time in Kazakhstan. Conclusions: These ndings may provide a basis for expansion of the reference MTB database, and furtherinvestigation of virulence and transmissibility patterns in MDR strains. This study may provide a basis for creation of the reference database, the subsequent study, and compar-ison with the different drug-resistant isolates circulating in Kazakhstan. This work highlights the importance of expanded targets for drug resistance detection in MTBisolates.

However, suc- cess rate is low: many patients do not respond, whereas others suffer from adverse effects. Immune response is mediated by immunological synapse - checkpoint proteinsinterface between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. Understanding complex interactions within immunological synapse will yield new biomarkers, with application toclinical trials optimization, companion diagnostics to existing drugs and better combination therapies. Materials and Methods: We developed a computational method that infers gene interaction networks from expres- sion pro les in large cohorts of patients using unsupervised Bayesian machine learning model. Our method also reducesthe dimensionality of data producing factors that represent differences between cancer sub-types and individual patients. We apply this method to bladder and kidneycarcinoma TCGA cohorts. Results and Conclusions: We used the panel of 21 genes expressed on cancer side of immunological synapse and 3transcription factors that regulate them. We found that a combinatorial markers have signi cantly better predictive power for patient survivability rate in comparison to singlegene expression: p-value of 0.0002 for KIRC and 0.0076 BLCA cohorts. Further, we build de-novo gene interactions networks from expression data and analysed in fluence (loadings) of genes on our combinatorial model in context of other co-expressed genes. Combinations containing NFE2L2, ICOSLG and PD-L1 are particularly predictivein KIRC, and NFE2L2 and VISTA in BLCA. Hence, we show utility of machine learning tools to generate combinatorial, multi-dimensional biomarkers from geneexpression measurements. GrantRefs: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9464-7475 P.

P17.013.B Softclipping of gene speci c primer extension enrichment to remove arti cial sequences from downstream analysis J. Rehker C. Heydt, R. B\u00fcttner, S. Merkelbach- Bruse University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany Primer based ampli cation of genomic target regions suf- fers from the fact that the primer sequence is initiallyindistinguishable from ampli ed captured sequence of the specimen. This might result in artifacts and undetected variants when amplicons overlap each other as variant callers take both into account, thereby reporting either incorrect allelic fractions or not calling the variant at all. Multiplex PCR as well as primer extension enrichmentsuffer from this drawback. Multiple tools are available that trim adapters from raw sequence. However there is an advantage to soft clip primers after alignment as it allowsfor more accurate indel detection at the ends of a captured fragment. Multiple open source tools are available for soft clipping of PCR primers based on the alignment start/endposition, but they do not seem applicable for primer extension enrichment. We therefore developed PESC (Pri- mer Extension Soft Clipper). It matches the starting positionand length of the primer to the alignment of read one. The primer is softclipped. The tool then continues to check the end of read two of the same readpair for overlap with theidenti ed primer and soft clips it as well. PESC is written in Python and can remove primers at a speed of ~1.2 million reads / minute on a regular desktop computer given a primerle for detection of tumor mutational burden with ~19000 entries. With a memory footprint of 13.7 MB in this setup it should integrate well into sequencing pipelines. J. Rehker: None. M. Ball: None. C. Heydt: None. R. B\u00fcttner: None. S. Merkelbach-Bruse: additional BMI loci R. Hammond , A. D. Wells, S. F. A. Grant Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States GWAS requires increasingly larger sample sizes to over- come extensive correction for multiple testing in order to uncover additional signals. As an alternative, we aimed atsalvaging suggestive association signals in a series of increasingly powered BMI GWAS efforts by intersecting our ATAC-seq and high-resolution promoter-focused C datasets. The biological constraint of insisting each SNP both coincide with open chromatin and be contacted directly by a gene promoter at sub-1kb resolution triagedthe vast majority of SNPs, leaving a manageable residual number for further interpretation. Conducting retrospective analyses utilizing three published GIANT BMI GWASefforts of increasing sample size from 2010, 2015 and 2018, we characterized promoter contacts with open SNPs at varying suggestive sub-threshold P-values from 5 relevant to neuronal, endocrine and immune function. We identi ed sub-threshold signals in theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 6452010 dataset corresponding Similarly, extending our 2010-based observations to the 2018 dataset we observed 64 loci. Furthermore, analyzing the 2015 dataset, we iden- tied 160 sub-threshold loci that went on to achieve genome-wide signi cance in 2018. The proportion of implicated SNPs, of course, varied with the given thresh- olds, with the most notable outcome being 90% of 2010biologically-constrained independent P<5\u00d71 0 5signals going on to be genome-wide signi cant in 2018.

Despite data in the literature about theperformance of cloud solutions, and the portability of individual applications, we could not identify an exhaustive, use case based comparison between the available options,which was speci c for genomics and providing metrics useful for decision making at institutional level. We have therefore designed three use cases, representing some of themost demanding applications in terms of computing and storage footprint: Human Whole Genome Sequencing, Single Cell RNA Sequencing, Shotgun MetagenomeSequencing. The use of large-sized datasets, for a total of 7.5TB, also allowed us to evaluate the effect of datacompression solutions. We have designed the analysis pipelines using Next flow on a Slurm scheduler, with Sin- gularity containers to maximise portability and reproduci- bility. By employing widely used applications, like GATK, Cell Ranger and Seurat, Metaphlan and Humann2, we ensured the relevance of our results for the community. Thisallowed us to collect and compare metrics in six dimensions consistently across different environments: performance, scheduling, cost, running features, data transfer as well asrisk/bene t. We performed the comparison on a high- performance computing (HPC) cluster on-premise and on a similarly designed Cyclecloud HPC on Azure.

Mundlos1,2, 1Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany,2Institute for Medical and Human Genetics, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin, Berlin, Germany Introduction: The prioritization of genetic mutations is of fundamental importance for the genomics, genetics and clinical communities. Current methods prioritizing larger chromosomal alterations such as Copy Number Variants(CNVs) based on their pathogenicity are limited by the lack of publicly available variant calls. We combined pathogenic and non-pathogenic CNVs from multiple data sources toanalyze the utility of functional annotation, such as reg- ulatory domains de ned by TAD boundaries, in the prior- itization of pathogenic CNVs. Methods: We matched pathogenic and non-pathogenic sets by size and variant count and conducted a series of enrichment tests to investigate any correlations betweenpathogenicity and overlap with genomic annotations. Finally, we implemented a novel method to annotate CNVs for manual and automated prioritization. Results: We con rm a correlation between the patho- genicity of a CNV and its tendency to overlap with gene- centric and regulatory elements. Additionally, we presentthe TAD annotation (TADA) tool, a method to annotate CNVs with respect to their regulatory environment and a proof-of-concept classi cation of pathogenic variants with high accuracy (AUC =0.8911).646 J. del PicchiaConclusions: Considering recent advances in sequencing and variant calling, the focus on larger genomic alterations in diagnostics will likely increase, raising the need for manual and automated prioritization methods. Our results show that the prioritization of pathogenic CNVs based on functional annotation is a promising approach. With anincreasing number of publicly available variant catalogues we aim to improve the classi er's predictive power and adapt our approach to all types of structural variants. J. Hertzberg: None. M.

(IRGB - CNR), Monserrato (CA), Italy Introduction: Great efforts have focused on identifying causal genetic variants shared between quantitative traits(QTs) and diseases. Several algorithms integrate association data and provide insights on the role of QTs in disease predisposition, such as Mendelian randomization, coin-cident associations and colocalization, all of them having benets and drawbacks. Among these three, the colocali- zation aims at identifying shared haplotypes in fluencing both QTs and disease to nd common molecular mechan- isms. Here, we carry out a comparison of three colocaliza- tion algorithms (coloc, eCAVIAR and gwas-pw) reviewingtheir strengths and weaknesses. Materials and Methods: We tested three colocalization software using GWAS summary statistics of 272 immuneQTs measured in up to 2,870 individuals from SardiNIA cohort and public data GWAS from a case-control meta- analysis on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (>100,000 indivi-duals). The three tools use different approaches based on Bayes factors to evaluate colocalization signals. Results: We considered as true positive the 270 trait- locus associations colocalizing (YC) or not-colocalizing (NC) with RA for at least 2 of the 3 tools, resulting in a total of 14 YC and 256 NC. Coloc and followed Conclusions: comparison showed a high concor- dance among the colocalization algorithms. This suggests that the choice of tool does not have a strong impact on the colocalization results and the identi cation of links between QTs or diseases. We can assert that the colocalization is a robust approach to investigate connections between QTsand to advance understanding of biological mechanisms behind disease predisposition. V. Rallo: None.

Strober, A. Battle Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United StatesAssociation studies have identi ed thousands of genetic variants associated with phenotypes ranging from moleculartraits to disease. These data offer the opportunity to com- pare genetic effects across traits and tissues. For example, by intersecting disease loci with expression quantitative traitloci (eQTL) we can help identify the regulatory mechanisms and target genes in fluencing disease. However, it remains challenging to identify which associations observed inmultiple traits are driven by shared causal variants as opposed to distinct mechanisms confounded by linkage disequilibrium (LD). The problem is particularly challen-ging in the presence of allelic heterogeneity, where multiple causal alleles occur in the same genomic region. In fact, the same region may harbor some shared and some distinctcausal effects across different tissues, conditions, or traits. We introduce a probabilistic model, CAFEH, which leverages multiple association studies to perform colocali-zation and ne-mapping across studies in the presence of allelic heterogeneity. CAFEH jointly models summary statistics from each study, using a factor analysis approachto identify patterns of association driven by shared and distinct causal variants. CAFEH outperforms competing colocalization methods, speci cally when multiple studies are provided. We apply CAFEH to eQTLs from 49 GTEx tissues, demonstrating much more extensive tissue- specicity than previously reported, and numerous cases of allelic heterogeneity with different causal components affecting different tissues. Applying CAFEH to UK Biobank data along with GTEx, we connect these patternsto shared causal factors with disease. Overall, our method improves understanding of allelic heterogeneity and shared genetic effects across traits and tissues. K. Tayeb: None. M. Arvanitis: None. B.J. Strober: None.

Raw sequencing data is processed, and genetic variants uploaded Genome-Phenome Analysis Platform ( https://pla tform.rd-connect.eu/ ). While a percentage of cases are being solved by automated reanalysis of short variants andexamination by domain experts, many datasets remain unsolved. For an important proportion of these, the detec- tion of copy number variants may help resolve the case, as itmay not have been attempted previously or our approach is more comprehensive. The accurate detection of CNVs from exome sequencing data is known to be a very challenging task due to the inherent stochasticity in the capture enrichment process. The challenge within SolveRD is ampli ed due to the submitted data being extremely heterogeneous in nature, having been sequenced in different places, at different times, using different machines and protocols. Of note, thedata submitted includes samples from more than 20 different commercial exome sequencing kits. To date we have generated CNV calls from over 5,000 exomes, using three CNV calling algorithms, ExomeDepth, Conifer, and ClinCNV, with tailored settings, and a clustering algorithm, ClusterWES to de ne which samples should be batched together. Here we detail our work flow, report on the outcome of these analyses, and provide somerecommendations for others who wish to undertake similar analyses. S. Laurie: None. G. Bullich: None. G.

Vyverman, Introduction: Copy number variations (CNVs) represent a signicant fraction of pathogenic germline mutations found in human conditions. Reliable identi cation of CNVs from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is challenging as it is impacted by many different factors, such as sample quality, sequencing depth, library preparation, ... Here wepresent a CNV calling algorithm developed and optimized for Agilent 's SureMASTR (amplicon based) NGS panels. Materials and methods: The algorithm is developed for the speci c needs of the enrichment strategies of Agilent 's SureMASTR panels and consists of the following: (1) Normalization by using a pooled reference from the same sequencing run, eliminating the need for matched normal samples. (2)Bias correction to control for GC-, length- and other technology-speci c biases in the sequencing data. (3) Quality ltering to remove low-quality samples, PCR plexes or genomic regions. (4)Hidden Markov Models calling. We also optimized the algorithm for dosagequotient (DQ) calculation and DQ-visualization of FFPE and FFT samples. This algorithm is incorporated in the MASTR Reporter, the analysis and quality control softwarefor (Sure)MASTR assays. MASTR Reporter CNV calling is for Research Only. Results: We tested the germline CNV calling algorithm on >500 clinical samples analyzed with different SureMASTR panels and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq, MiniSeq rmed exon- and gene- level CNVs. Across the different panels we observed a specicity >=98% and sensitivity of 100%. Conclusions: We present an algorithm for reliable CNV detection, that is speci cally optimized for NGS targeted sequencing panels. M. Vyverman: A.

Multi-channel flow cytometry (MFC) is an integral diagnostic method for diagnosis and monitoring of those disorders. MFC data analysis includes manual gating to interpret cellpopulations. Although several computational approaches are available to automate the process of gating, these methods require expert supervision to adjust the gate de - nitions. We created an automated tool to directly classify MFC data to diagnosis labels without any human proces- sing. MFC data (FCS les) were obtained from routine diagnostic of 20,622 patients. The dataset includes 8 B-cell lymphoma subtypes and healthy controls. Three 9-color MFC tubes were used to measure up to 50,000 cells percase. Compensated and transformed flow cytometry data from a single case is used to train a self-organizing map, which is used as input to a convolutional neural networkgenerating class predictions. We achieved an overall weighted F1 score of 0.92.We use transfer learning to classify data acquired with a different flow cytometry panel. We were able to increase the unweighted F1 score from 0.33 to 0.42 of a second network trained with 10,079 sam- ples from a 5-color panel by transferring the knowledgefrom our base network described above. We demonstrate an automated classi cation of FCS data into multiclass labels with high accuracy. We also show that the transfer ofknowledge between networks trained with data from dif- ferent flow cytometry protocols can improve the classi - cation performance of such networks, especially for the raresubtypes with very little data available.N.

Ware1,2 1National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom,2Cardiovascular Research Centre, Royal Brompton and Hare eld NHS, Foundation Trust London, London, United Kingdom Introduction: The interpretation of TTN missense variants in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) presents a variant interpretation since rare missense var- iants in TTN are prevalent in the population, and indis- tinguishable from those in patients with DCM. Previous studies assessing the relevance of TTN missense variants, using sequence conservation across species or structuralfeatures of proteins have been inconclusive. Methods: Since ~70% of the titin protein sequence and aggregated the degree of depletion of neutral missense variation within the human genome at each domain position of the twodomain families over homologous amino acids, by comparing the number of neutral variations based on a sequence-context model and variations observed among141,456 humans from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). Results: Six positions from within gnomAD populations (z-test P< 0.01). These constrained domain sites are enriched for ClinVar pathogenic variants inTTN and other proteins containing fn3 or I-set domains. We combined our constraint scores with existing variant effect prediction tools to prioritise TTN missense variants. Thepredicted pathogenic TTN increased association with DCM ( n=1,343) compared with health controls ( n=2,313) in a meta- analysis across three populations of different ancestries. Conclusions: The aggregation of constraint within the human population across homologous domains represents acomplementary and effective approach to prioritize mis- sense TTN variants with single amino acid resolution of large deleterious impact.

Ibrahim1,2, K. Op de Beeck1,2, E. Fransen1,3,M . Peeters2,4, G. Van Camp1,2 1Center of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp and Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium,2Center for Oncological Research, University of Antwerp and Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium,3StatUa Centre for Statistics, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium,4Department of Medical Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium Introduction: Due to the elevated rates of incidence and mortality of cancer, early and accurate detection is crucialfor achieving optimal treatment. Molecular biomarkers remain important screening an d detection tools, especially in light of novel blood-based assays. DNA methylation incancer has been linked to tumorigenesis, but its value as a biomarker has not been fully explored. In this study, we have investigated the methylation patterns of the Gas-dermin E gene across 14 different tumor types using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) methylation dataset (N=6502). Methods: Differential methylat ion was tested through linear mixed models. Binary logistic regression and partial-least squares discri minant analysis prediction models were used for identif ying pan-caner and tumor- speci cm a r k e r s .W ew e r ea b l et o identify six CpG sites that could effectively dist inguish tumors from normal samples in a pan-cancer setting (AUC =0.86). This combination of pan-cancer biomarkers was validated in six independent datasets (AUC =0.84-0.97). Moreover, we tested 74,613 different combinations of six CpG probes, where we identi ed tumor-speci c signatures that could differentiate one tumor type versus all the others(AUC=0.79-0.98). In all, methylation patterns exhibited great variation between cancer and normal tissues, but were also tumor speci c. Conclusions: Our analyses highlight that a Gasdermin E methylation biomarker assay, not only has the potential for being a methylation-speci c pan-cancer detection marker, but can also discriminate between different tumor types.

However, the rela- tionship between longitudinal changes in metabolite levels and differential DNAm is underexplored. We assessedassociations between epigenome-wide blood DNAm and changes in the levels of blood proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H-NMR) metabolomics-based traits. For 595 non-diabetic individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 with metabolomics data at ages 31 (T1) and 46 years (T2) as well as concurrent DNAm data (T2), wecalculated the average change in level per year between T1 and T2 for each of the 228 metabolomics-based variables. We used our methylSCOPA software for fast single-predictor longitudinal epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We regressed out participant sex from the change in metabolomic variable level and used the resulting resi-duals as predictors of DNAm in EWAS for 832,569 BeadChip. We quality-controlled, resi-dualized, and normalized the DNAm data, mapped genomic locations to CGCh37/hg19, and adopted epigenetic mark. We detected an epigenome- and and change over time in the level of triglycerides in extremely largevery low-density lipoprotein particles and potentially also chylomicrons.

For those, roughly the failed differential diag-noses are about 15%. It is dif cult to diagnose epilepsy, in many cases, a genetic study of the patient is required, and these may lead to false negatives. For those cases, we estimatesimilarity between epilepsy and other close disorders by transforming gene sets into phenotype sets to provide a clinical similarity between genetic diseases. The tool is called PhenoExam. Methods: PhenoExam uses a score that evaluates how many relevant phenotypes the reference panel shares withthe test panel and how similar is the representation of the shared phenotypes in relative terms. It works on HPO and MGI ontologies. Results: We have created a phenotypic space for 120 diseases whose gene-based de nitions where obtained from Genomics England PanelApp. Panels closest to epilepsy arehereditary ataxia, inherited white matter disease and hereditary neuropathy. Through PhenoExam we have rened the epilepsy panel predicting new epilepsy genes. They have a higher PhenoExam score of phenotype similarity than random genes (P < 10 5). Amongst those genes are KIF1A, NFASC, RYR2, CELF2. Conclusions: PhenoExam allows us to situate diseases, dened by a set of genes into a metric space based on phenotypical descriptions emer ging from individual genes. We conrmed that new genes likely to cause epilepsy recapitulate and correlate with relevant phenotypes extracted from NIMGenetics epilepsy Fundaci\u00f3n NIMGenetics.A. Cisterna: B.

Esophagealsquamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant his- tological subtype of esophageal cancer and diagnosed at late stage. The aim of the project was to identify genetic basis ofESCC by analysing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from whole-transcriptome sequencing of Kazakhstani patients. Materials and Methods: Tissue samples were obtained from 25 ESCC-affected individuals immediately after Ivor- Lewis esophagectomy from Oncology Center in Nur-Sultan. Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed following the TruSeq RNA Protocol. STAR software and DESeq2 package have been used for mapping and de ning differentially expressed genes. Functional analysis of DEGs was performed using various R packages. Results: The study sized 14 men and 11 women, average age of patient 65.5 \u00b1 7.7 years 88% of the patients were diagnosed with advanced stages T3-T4.

We found signi 4 up- regulated and down-regulated KEGG pathways ( p- value<0.05). Top 300 DEGs were mapped to PPI network and functional enrichment analysis was performed on identi ed three modules of closely connected nodes (genes).

Fallerini2, Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy,2Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Siena, Italy,3Medical Genetics, University of Siena, Siena, Italy Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy Exome sequencing is gaining importance in the clinical practice thanks to its high accuracy and the decreasingcosts. However, a great challenge in the analysis of exome sequencing experiments is how to identify variants that are clinically relevant among an overwhelming number ofvariants with no functional consequences. Many bioin- formatic scores exist for predicting the pathogenicity of genetic variants. In this work, we compared their perfor-mances, and we tested if it was possible to improve the accuracy of pathogenicity predictions by combining the available bioinformatic scores into a uni ed Machine Learning model using Logistic Regression. This inte- grated strategy improves the performance by almost 5% with respect to the best algor ithm available in the litera- ture and interestingly reduces by 7% the rate of benign variants that are wrongly classi ed as pathogenic. By integrating additional features, among which Minor AlleleFrequency (MAF) and the number of Pubmed articles related to the rs code (pubmed_rss), the Machine Learning model further improves the performance of almost 10%with respect to the best single algorithm alone and further decreases the rate of false positive up to 11%. This novel integrated score for pathogenic variant prediction, thatincorporates multiple sources of information into a single score, can therefore facilitate the analysis of exome sequencing experiments and speed up the identi cation of pathogenic variants by performing a more stringent and accurate selection of variants.

We will describe the ongoing extension of annotation workflows to use long transcriptomic data from PacBio and ONT in combination with RNAseq data to produce accuratefull-length transcript structures, CAGE, RAMPAGE and 3 - enriched RNAseq to identify transcript ends, and targeted proteogenomics and phylogenetic assessment to supportdecisions regarding protein-coding potential. Alongside the efforts to identify genes and alternatively-spliced (AS) transcripts we continue to work closely with our colleaguesat other resources to resolve con flicts. We have undertaken an extensive exercise to compare GENCODE and Uniprot annotation. The GIFTS (Genome Integration with FuncTionand Sequence) project has created a common framework for UniProtKB-Ensembl/GENCODE mapping. Using GIFTS, GENCODE annotators have investigated 716 Uniprotentries that do not map to a protein-coding gene in the Ensembl/GENCODE human geneset. The review process has led to updates to Ensembl/GENCODE gene annotation,discussions with Uniprot curators regarding entries that do not display high protein-coding potential in the genomic context, and identi cation of a set of loci where resource- specic criteria preclude agreement.

The comprehensive identi cation of regulatory elements and their gene targets is a signi cant challenge. We created GeneHancer (PMID:28605766), a regulatory element database within the GeneCards Suite rds.org/ ), with 400,000 enhancers of reg- ulatory elements, including the ir target gene associations, transcription factor binding sites, tissue speci city and super-enhancer mapping. We recently focus on pheno- type/disease annotation of such elements, based on variant-trait mappings GWAS Catalog, andliterature-curated evidence from DiseaseEnhancer and NCBI Entrez Gene. GeneHancer is now used by a con- siderable fraction of GeneCards '4 million user base to annotate non-coding variants, and is included as a native regulation track at the UCSC genome browser, where it is the only source for explicit regulatory regions and geneassociations. GeneHancer provides an indispensable augmentation for sequencing centers. Non-coding variants are mapped to regulatoryregions, and then prioritized with respect to diseases and phenotype keywords via direct and target gene-mediated links. Such capacities provide a comprehensive route todeciphering the clinical signi cance of non-coding single nucleotide and structural variations, thus helping to elu- cidate unsolved disease cases.

Hinxton, United Kingdom,2National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, Bethesda,MD, United States The accurate description of transcripts is foundational for clinical genomics. GENCODE (annotation produced by EMBL-EBI) and RefSeq (NCBI) produce and complementary human gene annotation. The large number ofalternatively spliced transcripts, together with unstandardised use of canonical transcripts across resources, can present challenges, especially in the clinical context. To address this,EMBL-EBI and NCBI are working together on the Matched Annotation from the NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) initia- tive. The is a genome-wide transcript set that:1) aligns to GRCh38, 2) 100% identical (ENST) and RefSeq (NM) transcripts and 3) is well-supported. The output, the MANE Select set,will include one transcript that is representative of biology at each protein-coding locus across the genome. Select tran- scripts are identi ed using independent computational pipe- lines complemented by manual review and discussion. The pipelines utilise evidence of functional potential such as expression levels, evolutionary conservation, and clinicalsignicance. Currently, we have released MANE Select transcripts for 75% of protein-coding loci across the genome, including 83% of validated clinical genes and 90% ofACMG59 genes. We aim to achieve genome-wide coverage in 2020 and are working closely with partners to encourage adoption of the MANE set on browsers and in clinicalworkflows. We envision this dataset serving as a uni ed high- value reference set for use in comparative genomics, clinical reporting and basic research.

P17.051.A Leveraging correlated risks to increase power in Genome-Wide Association StudiesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 653N. Mounier1,2, Z. Kutalik1,2 1University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland,2Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland Introduction: Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) are nowadays often conducted in more than 1 million sam- ples. Improved discovery, by further increasing study sizes isnot the only strategy. Leveraging information from published studies of related traits can improve inference. To this end, we developed a Bayesian GWAS approach that builds informa-tive priors for each single nucleotide variant (SNV) using GWASs of related risk factors (RFs). Methods: Mendelian Randomisation (MR) is used to derive multivariate causal effects of a set of iteratively selected RFs on the target outcome. These causal effects of the RFs on the outcome are then combined with the SNV 's effect on the identi ed RFs to build a Bayesian prior. Bayes Factors (BFs) are used to quantify the evidence in favour of the prior. P-values are assigned to these BFs to allow theidenti cation of associated SNVs. Results: We found a set of universally optimal parameters (instrument strength, clumping stringency andshrinkage intensity) that maximises the out-of-sample squared correlation between prior and observed effects (up to ~40%). We also derived an analytical formula for thenull BFs distribution, leading to a 6-fold reduced runtime and a more accurate estimation of BFs P-values, compared to permutation-based approaches. The method now alsoprovides posterior and direct (part of observed effect not mediated through the RFs) effect estimates that can be used for downstream analyses. Conclusions: The method, as well as functions facilitat- ing results visualisation, have been implemented in an R package ( https://github.com/n-mounier/bGWAS ) and can be applied to any GWAS summary statistics.

As an outcome of this trend, approaches that tackle missingness in epidemiological and omic datasets are of increasing demand. We developed a user-friendly web-based portal and an analytical platform ANGLIA: \"An users with (epi)genomic and other omic data, to address the issues raising from data missingness and to enable data harmonisation at the sum- mary statistics level. With ANGLIA we aim to address thechallenges by integrating approaches to imputation and multi-variable analysis of omics data both at the individual and summary statistics levels by implementing a frameworkof existing and novel analytical tools. These include re ning existing and developing new high-performance tools for missing data imputation, performing multi-phenotype (epi)genome-wide association studies (EWAS/GWAS) and performing EWAS/GWAS of composite measurements, as well as upcycling GWAS summary statistics to more recentgenotype imputation panels. The showcase of the developed platform is located at http://www.anglia.prokopenkogroup. org/ and will serve for the very immediate needs of the scientists working in the elds of genetics, epidemiology and statistical omics, and eventually to different branches of medicine through more accurate research of the omics data.Our proposed framework has potential to enhance statistical omics association studies of any kind, and enable new in- silico discoveries to advance further our understating of complex human conditions.

P17.053.C Accounting for age-of-onset, disease prevalence, and family information in Genome-wide Association Studies . E. M. Pedersen , J. W. Dreier, K. Musliner, ISPYCH-Broad Consortium, A. B\u00f8rglum, J. McGrath, S. Dalsgaard, J.Christensen, Mortensen, F. Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark Most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account only for information from the genotyped individuals. However, in epidemiological studies additional family and temporal information, e.g. family history, disease pre-valence and age-of-onset, are routinely accounted for.654 J. del PicchiaThe recently proposed methods; GWAX: genome-wide association study by proxy (Liu et al., Nat Genet 2017), LT- FH: liability threshold model, conditional on family history (Hujoel et al., BioRxiv 2019) and Cox regression GWAS (Staley et al., EJHG 2017) incorporate either family history or temporal information, but not both. Here we present anew method that extends LT-FH to account for both family and temporal information. We compared our approach to both standard GWAS, GWAX, and LT-FH using simulated polygenic liabilities and case-control phenotypes. When only accounting for sex of family members, we observed a modest improvement(3% increased power) over LT-FH and large improvement over GWAX (53% increased power) in simulations assuming a disease prevalence of 4% in males and 1% infemales. Accounting for changes in disease prevalence over time, age-of-onset, and oversampling cases (a common strategy in genetic studies) further increases statisticalpower. We applied our approach to several psychiatric and neurological disorders in the iPSYCH study of ve serious mental disorders: ADHD, Autism, Bipolar disorder,Depression, and Schizophrenia with more than 80,000 psychiatric cases and 50,000 controls. In summary, the liability-threshold model is a promising approach to increase power in GWAS when family history, disease prevalence over time, and temporal information is available. E.M.

P17.054.A Engaging the GWAS community to increase Summary Statistics data sharing in the GWAS Catalog M. Cerezo 1, J. A. L. MacArthur1, A. Buniello1,2,J . United Kingdom,3Division of Genomic Medicine, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, UnitedStates In recent years, summary statistics (SumStats) from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been increasingly used to provide insights into the mechanismsof complex disease, predict disease risk, prioritise candidate loci, and discover drug targets. The availability of SumStats has also proven bene cial for the development of new statistical methods, conditional associations, and integration with other omics. The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog ( www. ebi.ac.uk/gwas ) expanded its scope to include SumStats in 2017 and is now the largest and most updated freely available SumStats resource. Thanks to the increase of SumStats links in research articles, along with direct sub-mission to the Catalog, the percentage of new publications with available SumStats in the Catalog has increased from 6% in 2017 to 44% in 2019 and now includes over 10,000datasets. Despite an increase in author submissions, the percentage of publications with available SumStats remains relatively low, with 86% of Catalog publications not havingavailable SumStats. In an aim to facilitate the data sharing, we have developed a web-based deposition interface to support author submission of SumStats and meta-data frompublications. We are also planning a workshop to address the standards, infrastructure and incentives required to promote and enable sharing of SumStats. The workshopwill bring together participants from the diverse stakeholder space, including researchers, journal editors, funding bod- ies, and biobank representatives. The aim is to reach aconsensus and publish an agreed action plan for SumStats sharing and standardization which will have a positive impact on the GWAS community. M. Cerezo: None. J.A.L.

Kleanthous The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus Introduction: The ITHANET portal ( www.ithanet.eu )i sa n expanding, publicly available biomedical resource dedi-cated to haemoglobinopathies. It provides a manually curated, literature-derived collection of published genetic and epidemiological data, also integrating the latest updateson news, events, publications, clinical trials, funding opportunities, and many more.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 655Materials and Methods: A team of expert biocurators is involved in the collection, validation and annotation of information with weekly updates on scienti c literature collected from PubMed, also incorporating new and updated information from existing public databases. Con- tributions are welcome and clearly acknowledged. Results: ITHANET offers a range of curated databases; IthaGenes currently stores information on over 2900 fully annotated variations in more than 350 globin-related lociand genes. Most variations are assigned at least one of 60 phenotypic annotations in IthaGenes, taken from the Human Phenotype Ontology. IthaMaps stores epidemiologicalinformation as documented in published literature for a total of over 185 countries and illustrates this information on a dynamic global to regional map. IthaChrom providesdigitised reports (as kindly provided by Bio-Rad Labora- tories Inc.) of standard diagnostic HPLC analyses on more than 600 haemoglobin variants. Conclusions: ITHANET is the most comprehensive knowledgebase on haemoglobinopathies and the of cial partner of the Human Variome Project 's Global Globin Network for data storing, curation and sharing within and between countries. Also, this partnership fosters the development of a genotype-phenotype database for betterhealth care delivery and forms the basis of an Expert Panel application for haemoglobinopathy-related variant classi - cation under the Clinical Genome Resource.

Yet Department of Bioinformatics, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: The main aim of this study is to understand the biological mechanisms involved in disease susceptibilityand progression, by linking CNV, DNA methylation and gene expression to Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using Bayesian networks (BN). Methods and Results: To infer by tting BN we used HCC single-cell sequencing dataset contained 25 samples. We built three BN structuresrepresenting the alternative hypotheses of the causal relations between CNV, gene expression and methylation. The parameters of these networks were estimated by usingMLE. Afterwards, we examined the compatibility of these structures with the data by using the AIC score. After ttingall the models, there were 17 models where the best model was at least ten times more likely than the second best model. Discussion and Conclusion: The availability of different levels of \"-omics \"data allowed us to explore the relation- ship between \"-omics \"proles, speci - cally for genetic variation, methylation and gene expression. We build three BN structure for the alternative causal relations and detected several cases of three-way associa-tions where either genetically driven DNA methylation levels impact gene expression pro les, or genetically driven gene expression traits impact DNA methylation levels.Overall, these results suggest that the effects of DNA methylation can be both active on gene expression levels, and passive, by being a consequence for gene expressionlevels. This study shows the potential of integrating other \"-omics \"data for complex diseases. M. Jihad: None. I. Yet: None. P17.057.A A novel machine learning-based approach for screening Individuals at risk of hereditary haemochromatosis P. Martins Conde1,2, T. C282Y in the HFEgene accounts for 80%-85% of clinical cases among the Caucasian population. HH is characterised by the accumu- lation of iron, which, if untreated, can lead to the devel-opment of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. An iron overload screening tool (IRON), employing traditional statistical methods on self-reported and non-laboratory data, has beenproposed. This tool obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 68.5%, demonstrating great potential of integrating dif- ferent types of self-reported and clinical data into compu-tational screening tools. However, the utility of such tools is limited by challenges associated with ef ciently handling and combining large amounts of structured and unstructureddata from different sources. We have developed a novel computational model to identify individuals at risk of HH, using the family study data of the HEIRS cohort. Thisdataset, consisting of 254 cases and 701 controls, contains variables extracted from questionnaires and biomarker values. These variables were ranked using statistical andrecursive feature elimination methods. The model was trained on an XGBoost classi er using the most signi cant risk factors: homozygosity, iron-binding capacity. Parameter656 J. del Picchiaoptimisation was carried out with multiple runs, resulting in an AUC of 87.03% \u00b1 5.43 for 10-fold strati ed cross- validation.

Many tools exists for ROH discovery that rely on data from genotyping arrays orexome sequencing (ES). Since most of these tools had bad performances or were dif cult to use, we have developed a new tool: AutoMap (Autozygosity Mapper). AutoMap directly uses standard VCF les as primary source of data. A careful variant ltering step is implemented prior to the identi cation of ROHs by a sliding-window approach and subsequent ltering. The tool was rst trained on ES data from 26 samples from consanguineous families, and further validated in 26 additional samples. AutoMap displayedsimilar performance for both training and validation cohorts, with sensitivity of 90.5% and 92.4% respectively and showed the best sensitivity/speci city combination with respect to 8 existing tools. When applied to unpublished ES data, AutoMap allowed the discovery of ROHs containing homozygous non-coding variants that led to the identi ca- tion of disease genes for ve novel conditions including the Liberfarb syndrome. AutoMap is a reliable tool that can predict, in less than a minute, ROHs with high speci city and sensitivity by using a single VCF le. Our tool is available both via a web-based interface, for a quick ana- lysis with default parameters, as well as a command-linepackage, allowing assessment of a large numbers of sam- ples, the customization of many parameters and analysis of VCFs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) experiments.

P17.060.A reliable is HPO-based many,3The Jackson Laboratory for Medicine, Farmington, CT, United States The Human Phenotype Ontology has become a widely used tool for the precise 'deep'phenotyping of patients. How- ever, it remains unclear how accurate and reproducibleHPO-based phenotyping is. Different physicians put emphasis on different features, provide different detail levels, and have different opinions on the inclusion of non-cardinal symptoms. The complex structure of the ontology and the sheer amount of terms may also add some uncer- tainty, especially for novel users.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 657With The Reliable HPO, we strive to address these issues. We encourage physicians and biomedical researchers to 'phenotype 'simulated patients according to their health records. By comparing different HPO phenotype pro les of the same patient, we aim to determine the normal divergence in the HPO-based description of a patient 's symptoms and to identify missing or misleading terms. This knowledge will help us and other groups to better estimate a realistic 'fuzziness 'of symptoms when develop- ing software that utilises the HPO, for instance for the prioritisation of mutations in clearly described diseases. In addition, the results can and will be used for an optimisationof the names, synonyms, and descriptions of HPO terms. We include functions to suggest more appropriate names of the symptoms and new synonyms and to point out missingsymptoms. We will of course share all our ndings with the community.

We present analysis of phenotypic data in full-text papers publishedover one year in the American Journal of Human Genetics (AJHG).

Proportion of phenotype terms in corpus, mapped back to HPO using tf-idf and cosine similarity. Conclusions: We demonstrate a signi cant volume of extractable phenotypic data contained within full-text papers describing GDD, most of which can be mapped toHPO terms using closest string match methods. The design of an automated system to extract phenotypes from the scienti c literature will be informed by the data architecture presented here, with substantially more information in supplementary les. Ultimately, genotype-phenotype corre- lation using literature-derived disease models derived from this system will signi cantly increase the rapidity and accuracy of diagnosis in GDD. Grant reference: Wellcome Strategic Award and imputation of low-coverage sequencing using reference panels S. Rubinacci , D. Ribeiro, R. Hofmeister, O. Delaneau University Lausanne, SwitzerlandLow-coverage whole genome sequencing followed by imputation has been proposed as a cost-effective genotyp-ing approach. However, its competitiveness against SNP arrays is undermined as imputation methods are computa- tionally expensive. Here we describe a method for imputation of low- coverage sequencing datasets called GLIMPSE. The efciency our method is achieved by combining advanced658 J. del Picchiadata structures (PBWT) with a new powerful linear-time sampling algorithm. As a consequence, the computational time to impute a single variant decreases as the size of the reference panel increases, which is an important property since larger panels are constantly made available. We compared the performance of GLIMPSE to other low- coverage imputation methods: BEAGLE, GENEIMP and STITCH. GLIMPSE is more accu rate for the full allele- frequency range and for rare variants the difference is morepronounced, as GLIMPSE gets an increased accuracy of more than 20%. Notably, these improvements are obtained in running times that are several orders of magnitude shorter of othermethods, archiving imputation of a full genome for less than 1$. Our results show that 1x coverage enables effective association studies in standard eQTL settings and is bettersuited than SNP arrays to access the impact of rare variations. We also show that this increased accuracy is more evident for populations not well-represented on SNParrays. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of 4x coverage outperforming every other setting tested. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of low-coverage imputation and suggest a paradigm shift in the design of future genomic studies. Swiss National Science Foundation project grant (PP00P3_176977).

P17.065.C Machine learning to distinguish true somatic variants from noise in tumour only next generation sequencing data C. Jaramillo Oquendo , H. Parker, J. C. Strefford, J. Gibson, Ennis University of Southampton, Southampton, United King- dom Introduction: Discovery of driver mutations in cancer play a key role in developing staging systems and targeted drugs toght this disease. Identi cation of somatic mutations is complex, often aided by concurrent analysis of germline tissue, which is not always available. However, detecting true somatic mutations without germline tissue may leavenumerous false positives in the data, requiring validation or time-consuming manual curation. Our aim was to develop an unsupervised machine learning model to distinguish truesomatic variants from noise in tumour-only data. Methods: n=62), sequenced, and variants were called with an in-house pipeline that populated numerous qua lity metrics. Variants were lteredto enrich for somatic mutations and manually curated by two independent investigators, labelling each variant true or false. Ten features were selected after evaluation of all quality metrics for their value in the model. Clus tering was performed using k- means. Results: Variants ( n=873) clustered into ve groups, true variants in one group and false in to four, with 92% agreement to manual curation labels. Our a pproach accurately predicted 210/217 (97%) and 637/656 (97%) of the variants labelled trueand false respectively. Principal component analysis identi ed mutant allele frequency and quality as the features with the greatest effect on variance between true and false clusters. Conclusions: This approach successfully identi ed the majority of true variants with high sensitivity and specicity, allowing for a faster and more accurate method ofltering out noise in tumour-only samples.

Introduction: Neural networks are currently the state of the art in many domains but seldom applied for genetic risk prediction. Reliable genetic risk prediction demands a net-work that is able to handle a large number of genetic var- iants, as well as produce interpretable results that provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. Methods: We propose GenNet, a framework with novel interpretable genetic neural network architectures. Prior biological knowledge (such as DNA annotations, pathways,and gene expression) is used to create layers limited to functionally meaningful connections, thereby constructing computational feasible and interpretable network architec-tures. Each node represents a biological entity (e.g. gene, pathway). Learned weights represent the contribution of these entities to the overall prediction providing theimportant entities without any secondary analysis. Results: The framework 's effectiveness is demonstrated by predicting various diseases or traits across a widespectrum of polygenicity. Table 1 shows the performance and the genes with the largest predictive contributions per phenotype. The framework is not limited to gene-basedresults. It also includes architectures based on genomic, tissue, cell type, and other functional annotations.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 659Conclusion: We developed GenNet, a interpretable neural networks to predict phenotype from genotype data by incorporating prior biological knowledge. Given the interpretability of the network, we anticipate this approach as having the potential for uncovering novel insights into the genetic architecture of complex diseases.

M.A. Ikram: value of RNA sequencing on top of WES for variant interpretation and diagnosis of patients with Mendelian disorders V. A. Yepez1, M. Munich, Munich, Germany Introduction: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is promising technology to complement Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)for pinpointing the genetic cause of Mendelian diseases. However, with ever-growing and improving databases of WES samples, and better variant effect predictors, the relativeadvantage of RNA-seq may be questioned. Materials and Methods: We performed RNA-seq on broblasts from 245 individuals affected with a mitochondrial disease who had previously und ergone WES, which represents the largest RNA-seq compendium f or rare disease diagnostics. We built a computational pip eline to prioritize genes harbouring either mono-allelic e of a rare allele, aberrant expression level using OUTRIDER, or aberrantsplicing using a novel algorit hm called FRASER. Moreover, we pinpointed rare variants associated with the prioritized genes either by re-annotating WES variants in the light of the RNA-seq results or by calling v ariants from the RNA-seq data. Results: We provided a diagnosis for 15% (24 out of 165) of WES unsolved cases. We also showed that themajority of OMIM diseases genes are expressed in each of the following clinically accessible tissues: whole blood, muscle, and broblasts, suggesting that RNA-seq of accessible, yet not affected, tissues may be suitable for a broad range of rare diseases. We share our computational workflow, called DROP (Detection of RNA Outliers Pipeline), that integrates all analysis steps, can leverage parallel computing infrastructures, and generates browsable web page reports. Conclusions: Collectively, these results further establish RNA-seq as an effective strategy for validating or invalidating variants of unknown signi cance and for the discovery of pathogenic gene regulatory events.

Mizrahi Man , M. H. Woehrmann, T. Webster, J. Gollub, A. Roter, J. Schmidt Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Santa Clara, CA, United States Introduction: UK Biobank is a health resource that follows the health and well-being of 500,000 participants, all gen- otyped with very high accuracy on Thermo Fisher Scien- tic's Applied Biosystems TMAxiomTMmicroarrays. A recent pre-publication based on this data set claimed that microarrays may not be the technology of choice for calling very rare variants, de ned as having minor allele frequency below 0.01%. We show that a genotyping algorithm mod- ication tailored to very rare variants achieves excellent accuracy for these variants. Materials and Methods: We have optimized the genotyping algorithms for very rare variants. For common variants the location of the heterozygous cluster providespowerful evidence for heterozygous calls. Rare variants usually have a single sample in the het cluster, making the call less robust. An in-depth analysis of the distribution ofreplicate probe signal on Axiom microarrays revealed this distribution can be used to signi cantly improve the accuracy of heterozygous calls. Results: Eight separate data sets with 1000 Genomes Project truth originally achieved positive predictive values660 J. del Picchia(PPVs) ranging from 60% to 93% for very rare variant calls. The new algorithms increased all PPVs to near 90% while losing on average only 0.5% of correct calls. We will report the results of applying the new algorithms to rare variant genotyping in the UK Biobank cohort. Conclusions: Improved algorithms for genotype calls for Axiom microarrays improve the PPV of very rare variants while minimally affecting sensitivity.

Nazarenko Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Research Medical Center, Tomsk, Russian Federation Introduction: Trimming of adapter sequences from miRNA-seq data is a common preprocessing step during NGS data analysis. Overtrimmed reads and adapter con- tamination can be challenging for downstream analysis. Wehave proposed an algorithm called AdapMiR for the trim- ming adapters and further analysis of miRNA expression that turns these drawbacks into advantages. Our algorithmcan achieve high accuracy of adapter trimming and discard non-miRNA reads. Material and Methods: AdapMiR was implemented in R language. miRNA-seq data of atherosclerotic plaques (n=5) and healthy vessels ( n=5) was used as a test dataset. Mature miRNAs sequences were obtained frommiRBase and used for construction of arti cial reference including adapter sequences. BWA and edgeR were used for read alignment and differential expression analysis. Wecompared developed algorithm with miARma-Seq and Trimmomatic in high sensitivity mode. AdapMiR is freely available ( https://github.com/alekseizarubin/AdapMiR ). Results and discussion: of adapMiR and Trimmomatic differed for 55% of miRNA reads. Moreover, we noticed a peculiarity in Trimmomatic output: the lesserread length the more probable was overtrimming, but longer read sequences ( 20 bp) could contain adapter fragments. Incontrast, AdapMiR did not produced excessively trimmed reads while ltered out erroneously read nucleotides. Only 2% of total counts per sample differed between algorithms. The number of differentially expressed miRNAs between atherosclerotic plaques and healthy vessels were equal ( n= 151), but resulting lists of both algorithms was different by 18 miRNA. Conclusions: AdapMiR is comparable to miARma-Seq approach. Our algorithm improves the accuracy of single-end read trimming by adding adapter sequences to the reference. A. Zarubin: None. A.

Knaus1, D. .M statistics and bioinformatics, Bonn, Germany,2Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany In our ongoing study we evaluate the effects of ionizing radiation on the offspring of exposed soldiers. We sequenced the entire genomes of 56 families with 87 children on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Eighteen offspring of twelve families have earlier been sequenced on a HiSeq X, three of which have now been resequenced. In ourcomparison we found a sequencing pattern with an increased rate of A > C and T > G transversions on the NovaSeq, most probably due to its novel two-colorchemistry. Our focus lies on speci c mutational patterns such as MSDNs (at least two de novo mutations within 20 bp), SVsand CNVs, which could be a result of DNA damage from exposure to ionizing radiation before conception of the children. From our large cohort we are able to reliably estimate age effects and compare the performance of different variant calling applications. We con rmed the origin of all MSDNs using long-read and Sanger sequencing and validated all complex de novo variants. We found that MSDNs occurred only on the paternal allele. Since only fathers were exposedto ionizing radiation, this nding strengthens our hypothesis that MSDNs could serve as a biomarker to identify previous exposure for exposure to ionizing radiation. In our cohort we detected 1.125 MSDNs/offspring of exposed fathers compared to 0.3 MSDNs/offspring in unexposed controls. These numbers are corrected for ageeffects and platform speci c mutational signatures.

P17.077.C unCOVERApp: an interactive graphical web- application for clinical assessment of sequence coverage at the base-pair level E. Iovino1, T. Pippucci2 1University of Bologna, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Bologna, Italy,2Medical Genetics Unit, Sant'Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital, Bologna, Italy Introduction: The rapid spread of Next Generation Sequencing technology has been coupled since its begin-ning with development of bioinformatic tools for data analysis and interpretation. However, despite increasing accuracy of available approaches, the need to assesssequencing quality of the analysis targets at the base-pair resolution poses growing challenges, especially in the clinical settings. In diagnostics indeed, meticulous investi-gation of every single target base is often required to exclude that pathogenic events across the gene of interest may be missed due to uneven sequence coverage. Wepresent unCOVERApp an application both for graphical inspection both dbNSFP-based annotations of sequence coverage at base-pairs levels. Method: unCOVERApp is a freely available application written in R and developed with Shiny packages ( https:// github.com/Manuelaio/unCOVERApp ). Results: unCOVERApp is a suite of graphical and statistical tools to support the clinical assessment and annotation of low-sequence coverage positions in genomicdata, providing interactive plots displaying gene sequence coverage, functional and clinical annotations of base-pair positions within user-de ned coverage thresholds to support user's judgement about their possible clinical relevance. Importantly, the binomial calculator expresses the prob- ability that a variant is missed given its expected allelicfraction and sequence coverage. The maximum credible allele frequency calculator allows to label existing variants within low coverage regions based on allele frequencycalculated according to the disease model instead of using general cut-offs (e.g. 0.05). Conclusions: uncoverApp is a graphical interface tool designed to help especially clinically-oriented users in easy inspection of coverage pro les of the gene of interest at the base-pair level. E.

Petrovski AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom Elucidating functionality in human non-coding sequence is a key genomics challenge. It has been shown that intoler- ance to variation of coding and proximal non-codingsequence is a strong predictor of human disease relevance. Here, we expand on published methods by applying a tiled genome-wide Residual Variation Intolerance Score(gwRVIS) to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from 62,784 individuals with lower gwRVIS corresponding to greater intolerance to genetic variation. We veri ed that gwRVIS distinguishes sequence occupied by human Mendelian disease genes from intergenic sequence (median gwRVIS 0.54 versus 0.011; p=2.4 \u00d7 10 195). Remarkably, despite being focused solely on human lineage purifying selection, gwRVIS identi ed sequence occupied by known ultra-conserved themost intolerant category (median gwRVIS =0.85; p< 1\u00d71 0 320). gwRVIS also boosts predictive performance in pathogenic variant detection from ClinVar in intergenicregions, lincRNAs and UTRs. We then employ annotation (including methylation \"Junk learning itise non-coding variants using only human lineage-speci c information. Despite not incorporating any conservation information, JARVIS outperforms every comparable score on pathogenicity inference of non-coding variants andperforms comparably or better in some cases over current state-of-the-art methods that do employ conservation information. Both gwRVIS and JARVIS capture previouslyinaccessible human-lineage constraint information as derived from 62,784 WGS to help prioritise genetic variants found in the human non-coding regulatory sequence andfurther enable the pursuit of novel drug targets and bio- markers in the non-coding genome.

Bergant , Genomic Medicine, Ljubljana, Slove- nia Introduction: Despite known risk factors and monogenic causes most sporadic and familial cases of Parkinson 's disease (PD) remain idiopathic. In our study we hypothesize that polygenic causes explain a proportion of idiopathiccases and use machine learning on exome sequencing data to identify individuals at risk for PD. Materials and Methods: We analyzed genetic variants detected by clinical exome sequencing of 68 early onset or familial PD patients with no discovered monogenic cause and 323 control individuals. All single nucleotide codingvariants with genotype quality 100 have been selected and the number of germline variants per gene has been calculated for all individuals. A single dataset containingthe calculations, information on all analyzed genes and the individual 's disease status has been prepared as an input to the ML analysis. We employed a supervised ML algorithm,gradient boosted trees with regularization (eXtreme Gra- dient Boosting), which used the observed patterns to determine, rst, the possibility to predict the disease status on the test group and, second, the subset of genes with the highest contribution to the prediction. Results: ML approach yielded the accuracy of 80.5%, and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 74.3% (sensitivity: 30.8%, speci city: 90.6%). The genes contributing highly to the algorithms prediction wereanalyzed and a pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Conclusions: The results show that the argument for a signicant polygenic risk on the development of PD is promising, however, larger studies are necessary to further determine its impact. G.

Tikva, Israel,2Depart- ment Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel,4Pediatric Children 's Medical Center Israel, Petah Tikva, Israel,5Laboratory of Immunology and Genetics, Felsenstein Petah Tikva, Israel Introduction: Searching online databases for a genetic diagnosis that ts a clinical phenotype is used routinely in clinical genetics. We investigated the diagnostic yield of phenotype-based search using free online databases. Materials and methods: We included consecutive solved cases from our whole-exome database. For each case, the combination of Human Phenotype Ontology(HPO) terms reported by the clinician was used to search three commonly used databases: Online Inheri- tance in Man (OMIM), Phenolyzer and Mendelian. Weexamined the actual molecular diagnosis (AMD) found by whole-exome sequencing was included in the search results (First 300 in OMIM and Phenolyzer; All 100in Mendelian). Results: One hundred consecutive cases were included (43 females; mean age: 10 years). Search results includedthe AMD in none of the databases in 33.0% of cases, and in one, two or three databases in 30.0%, 20.0% and 17.0% of cases, respectively. The rst 5 search results included the AMD in only 9.0%, 6.0% and 7.0%, in OMIM, Phenolyzer and Mendelian, respectively. When included, the AMD 's mean rank in the results 'list was 97 (range: 1-295), 56 (1- 270) and 37 (1-92) in these databases, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that phenotype- based search using free online databases is ineffective innding a probable diagnosis of mendelian conditions. It emphasizes the need for better search tools and for a more structured approach in HPO terms selection, and maysuggest that, at least in some cases, a genotype- rst approach with backward phenotyping may be more appropriate.

Park2,J . 1Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,2Samsung Genome Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic ofAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 663As massive resources of genotype and phenotype data become available, genetic risk score holds great potential to improve precision medicine. Unfortun ately, the problem of missing heritability still prevails, desp ite several previous studies had improved the conventional polygenic risk score, for which risk alleles were weighted by the effect size of their association withgiven trait and summed up. To alleviate the problem here we systematically explore epistasis between genes that may mod- ulate polygenic risk score for greater accuracy. Speci cally, we developed a model assuming mu ltiplicative interactions between different loci and applied the model to blood assay quantitative traits in UK Biobank. To avoid over tting emerged from enumerated variables depicting many interactions between loci, we employed a shrinkage method. We found that the epistasis model indeed improved polygenic risk score forseveral traits, including total bilirubin and Lipoprotein A. We further investigated the function al relationships between genes that may contribute to the discovered epistatic effects. J. Park: None. I. Kim: None. J. Chae: None. G. Kim: None. H. Won: None. W.

Haley2,O .L a o3, P. Navarro2, S. Knott1 1Institute of Evolutionary Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom,2MRC Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 3CNAG-CRG, Barcelona, Spain When humans left Africa and dispersed around the world, they met novel environments to which their phenotypes were not adapted. The resulting local selective pressures ineach of these geographically distinct populations varied in direction and strength, and led to a plethora of divergent phenotypic adaptations. This research studies the genomicngerprint left by these processes for hair colour, a trait with substantial inter and intra-population phenotypic var- iation, that we use as a proof-of-concept for differentialadaptation. Genomic regions strongly associated with hair colour are de ned based on a published GWAS of the white British population. Evidence for positive selection in theseregions is evaluated with a single, composite statistic. This statistic is produced by merging ve different tests of positive selection with the De-correlated Composite ofMultiple Signals method, used for multivariate analyses. By applying conservative P-rank transformations, we integrate signal information from both of haplotype homozygosityand Site-Frequency Spectrum (SFS) into a single, normally distributed parameter of adaptation. Association betweenhair colour and selection is tested using permutation-based methodologies. Signi cant regions from the British hair- colour GWAS are tested for selection across all 26 popu- lations present in the 1000 Genomes ), comparing how positive selec- tion shaped each of them. As selective sweeps often lead toextreme allele frequencies (MAF, it is possible that inter- mediate size alleles undergoing recent adaptation are nearly xed and thus undetectable by GWAS. To evaluate this effect the analysis is repeated selecting GWAS regions based on effect sizes instead of p-values. F. Ganau: None. C.S. Haley: None. O. None. P17.086.C GenomeMixer and NiPTUNE: novel bioinformatics tools to improve Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing for fetal aneuploidies V. Duboc 1, D. Timone, Marseille, France Introduction: The discovery of free circulating fetal DNA in maternal blood has led to the development of Non- Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) techniques for detection of fetal aberrations such as trisomy 21. NIPT is based on theanalysis of small fragments of DNA, circulating freely in the maternal blood, by massively parallel sequencing. Its reliability relies heavily on both the presence in the maternalblood of a suf cient amount of fetal DNA (ff for fetal fraction) and a suf cient sequencing depth (sd). Bioinfor- matics tools have been developed to determine the ff butthere is currently no reference method in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: We developed GenomeMixer, an approach to estimate con dence intervals for aneuploi- dies prediction, usable by all diagnostic laboratories and NiPTUNE, a package to automate NIPT analysis. Geno- meMixer creates synthetic sequencing data mixing readsfrom pregnant women with fetal aneuploidies and from non-pregnant women in order to determine the threshold of both minimum ff and sd necessary to detect aneuploidiesreliably. Niptune pipeline is composed by several modules including quality control, ff estimation by different methods and aneuploidies prediction. Results: We tested our tools on 2 different cohorts composed by 377 and 1055 samples including respectively664 J. del Picchia10 and 24 aneuploidies. GenomeMixer allowed to deter- mine minimal threshold of both ff and sd. NiPTUNE was validated thanks to the retrospective study performed on the cohorts. Conclusions: We have developed bioinformatics tools to empower each diagnostic laboratory to determine thecondence intervals of both ff and sd necessary to a reliable NIPT. V. Duboc: None. D.

P17.087.A Classifying Rare Genetic Variants by Enriching and Clustering on 3D Protein Structure Domains J. D. Stephenson 1, R. A. Laskowski1, M. E. Hurles2,J .M . Thornton1 Introduction: Variant classi cation is an important step in reducing the diagnostic odyssey for patients with raregenetic disorders. For missense variants their direct effect is largely determined by their local environment as dictated by their position in the protein structure. This means that othervariants in the local environment may lead to a similar protein consequence. Our method classi es variants of unknown signi cance by considering their positions in structure relative to known pathogenic or neutral variants. Materials and Methods: We map neutral and known pathogenic variants to the most relevant protein 3Dstructures and then enrich the data to aid pattern detection by combining variant data across structurally conserved regions of proteins. Following this we discover clusters ofknown pathogenic and neutral variants on the protein structure domain assemblage with parameters optimised using machine learning to capture variant effects commonacross proteins with shared structure. Single VUS or entire cohorts are then compared with our pre-calculated clusters across all conserved structural domains containing over100,000 protein structures. Results: Our method classi es individual VUS based on their proximity to pre-calculated neutral/pathogenic regionswith con dence values based on domain speci c model classi cation precision. Using this method we have analyzed a set of 30,000 missense VUS from patients withrare developmental disorders and uncovered several pre- viously unreported gene associations. Conclusions: Our method offers a complementary approach to other pathogenicity predictors by combiningevolutionary structure conservation with the most Clumping and Thresholding for polygenic scores F. Priv\u00e9 1,2, has the potential to contribute to pre- cision medicine. Clumping and Thresholding (C +T) is a widely used method to derive polygenic scores. Weimplement an ef cient way to derive thousands of different C+T polygenic scores corresponding to a grid over several hyper-parameters. We nd that optimizing over the pro- posed four hyper-parameters improves the predictive per- formance of C +T in both simulations and real data applications, as compared to tuning only the p-value threshold of C +T. A particularly large increase can be noted when predicting depression status, from an AUC of 0.557 (95% CI: [0.544-0.569]) when tuning only the p- value threshold in C +T to an AUC of 0.592 (95% CI: [0.580-0.604]) when tuning all four of C +T. Overall, by optimizing C +T polygenic scores, one can achieve prediction accuracies on par with more sophisti- cated approaches such as LDpred and lassosum (Vilh- j\u00e1lmsson 2015, Mak 2017). We further propose Stacked Clumping and Thresholding (SCT). Instead of choosing one set of hyper-parameters that maximizes prediction in some training set, SCT learns anoptimal linear combination of all C +T scores (stacking). We apply SCT to 8 different case-control diseases in the UK biobank data and nd that SCT signi cantly improves prediction accuracy compared to C +T, resulting in an average AUC increase of 0.035 over standard C +T. We conclude with extensions of SCT. F. Priv\u00e9: None. Vilhj\u00e1lmsson: None. Blum: None. P17.090.A Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms modulating gene expression by transcription factors. A novelapproach for regulatory QTLs .Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics Conference: de Llobregat, Spain,2Color- ectal L 'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain, 3Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Madrid,Spain, 4Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States Introduction: The functional role of expression quantita- tive trait loci (eQTLs) often remains to be explained. Most of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved inare located in regulatory regions such as promoters or enhancers, and could interact with transcription factors (TFs) to regulate gene expression (regQTLs). We hypo-thesize a main role of TFs mediating the association between SNPs and gene expression. Materials and Methods: Colon tissue biopsies and blood samples were obtained from 191 healthy donors, from which both gene expression and genotype data were generated. Using expression data, a consensus GeneRegulatory Network (GRN) was constructed by merging three different GRN inference methods (ARACNE-ap, BC3, and GENIE3), to get only robust interactions. Finally,regression models were applied to detect regQTLs, using co-expression of TF -gene pairs learned by GRN and SNPs located in regulatory sites. Results: We found a total of 1,427 different interactions between regQTLs, TFs and target genes, comprising 73 unique target genes of 109 TFs and 1,212 unique regQTLs(FDR < 0,01). We plan to enlarge the existing dataset to nearly 500 samples during the next months. Conclusions: In this study, we present a novel in-silico method that identi ed 1,212 unique regQTLs, and could help to explain regulatory interactions and genome-wide disease associations. Preliminary results still need to be validated. references: NIH/NCI None. M. Devall: None. G. Casey: None. V. Moreno: None. P17.092.C INFRAFRONTIER services for rare disease research A. Ali Khan , R. Michna, M. Raess, INFRAFRONTIER GmbH, Munich, GermanyAccording to the EU, a rare disease is de ned as a disease afflicting fewer than 1 in 2000 individuals. It is estimated that 30 million people in Europe suffer from a rare disease. There are currently about 7000 rare diseases known with more being discovered continually. The eld of rare dis- eases suffers from a de cit of medical and scienti c knowledge. These diseases reside in the 'unchartered space ' of biomedical research with their treatment marred by a dearth of medical and biochemical knowledge. This has ledto development and implementation of several strategies to tackle the treatment of rare and debilitating diseases. For example, the EU supports research into rare diseasesthrough Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. Via Horizon 2020, about \u20ac900 million is available to more than 160 collaborative projectsrelated to rare diseases. The core services of INFRA- FRONTIER (the European Research Infrastructure for Mouse Models) comprise of the systemic phenotyping ofmouse mutants in the participating mouse clinics, and the archiving and distribution of mouse mutant lines by the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA) which alsoinclude lines important for rare disease research. To con- solidate and present the INFRAFRONTIER / EMMA resources related to rare diseases in an easily accessiblelocation, the INFRAFRONTIER and Rare Diseases web page was created, providing access to a) EMMA strains related to rare diseases b) EMMA publications related torare diseases and c) information on INFRAFRONTIER activities at rare disease conferences.

Whif n, P. Barton, J. Ware Imperial College London, London, United KingdomIntroduction: Distinguishing novel pathogenic from rare but benign variants is a key challenge in clinical genetics.Machine learning tools that predict the consequence of missense variants typically perform unreliably on novel variants since there is little information to be used intraining sets.

Welook for functionally equivalent variants of known con- sequence at equivalent positions across paralogous protein666 J. del Picchiafamilies and use their information to predict pathogenicity. This method was validated in a restricted set of arrhythmia syndrome genes. Here, we extend it exome-wide. Materials and Methods: Paralogue relationships as dened by Ensembl were examined in 7,016 protein- coding genes associated with human diseases, that harbor48,258 (Likely) Pathogenic/Benign missense variants from ClinVar. PA and current established prediction tools were applied to this and multiple independent test sets. Results: We identify 3,621 genes that have at least 1 paralogue and show that equivalent pathogenic variants from other related proteins provides strong supportingevidence for pathogenicity at 98% precision for ClinVar variants. Other tools have a lower precision (mean 57.3% less) and higher false-positive rate (mean 98.4% more)across all variants tested. With current identify 178,378 potentially informative annotations exome-wide. Conclusions: PA represents an under-used source of information with an extremely high positive predictive value for identifying novel and rare disease-causingvariants. As more variants arise, the utility and power of PA will increase over time. N. Li: None. E. Mazaika: None. R. Walsh: None. P. Theotokis: None. M. Ahmed: None. M. Jang: None. X. Zhang: None. N.

Tamiya1,2,3 1Advanced Research Center for Innovations in Next- Generation Medicine, of Pedia- trics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, of Information Sciences, Tohoku Uni- versity, Sendai, Japan The human reference genome is an invaluable resource both for basic and clinical genetic research. However, the referencegenome lacks some population-speci c sequences, is mainly composed of genomes from African or European origins, and has > 90,000 rare reference alleles. Here we report JG1, apopulation-speci c reference genome built by integrating three de novo Japanese genome assemblies. We performedthree de novo hybrid assemblies of >100X PacBio long reads and >100X Bionano optical maps per individual. After error- correction with the long and >50X short reads, the three assemblies were meta-assembled by using mate-pair infor- mation. We then replaced minor alleles in the meta-assembled genome by major alleles de ned among the three individual assemblies. Finally, we built pseudo-chromosomes by anchoring each scaffold to each chromosome on the basis of marker positional information from genetic and radiationhybrid maps. The resulting genome JG1 was (non-reference allele frequency > 90% Japanese population). Moreover, we performed con rmatory exome re-analysis of rare diseases using JG1 as a reference, and found that the number of total variant calls was smaller in JG1 than in the reference hs37d5, while the variant call set retained the causal variants. Theseresults suggest that integration of multiple assemblies is an effective way to build a high-quality population-speci c reference genome. JG1 is publicly available ( https://jmorp.megabank. None.

Here, we present Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of DifferentialExpression and ALternative Splicing (HBA-DEALS), which simultaneously characterizes differential expression and splicing in cohorts. The statistical model of HBA-DEALS characterizes genes as having differential gene expression (DGE), differential alternative splicing (DAST),Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 667both, or neither. We analyzed 50 simulated datasets for DGE with HBA-DEALS and ve other tools: voom, for DAST with rMATS. HBA-DEALS displayed a larger area under the precision-recall curve than the other approaches did for bothDGE and DAST. To assess the accuracy of HBA-DEALS using real data, we ran HBA-DEALS on estimated isoform levels from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) pro-ject. We used HBA-DEALS to identify differentially expressed and differentially spliced genes in 20 different pairs of tissues and found a high degree of overlap of genesidenti ed as differentially expressed or spliced (p < 2.23 \u00d7 10 308for all comparisons, hypergeometric test). Based on an analysis of the GTEx data, we demonstrate the existenceof sets of genes that show predominant DGE or DAST across a comparison of 20 tissue pairs, and show that these sets have pervasive differences with respect to gene struc-ture, function, membership in protein complexes, and pro- moter architecture.

P17.096.A ROHMM, a flexible HMM approach for detecting homozygosity using next generation sequencing data G. \u00c7elik versity, Ankara, Turkey,2Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Runs of long homozygous stretches (ROH) are considered to be the result of consanguinity and usuallycontain recessive deleterious disease causing mutations. Several algorithms have been developed to detect ROHs. Here, we developed a simple, alternative strategy byexamining X chromosome non-pseudoautosomal region (Non-PAR) to detect the ROHs from NGS data utilizing the genotype probabilities and the hidden Markov model(HMM) algorithm as a tool, namely ROHMM. It is implemented purely in java and contains both command line and GUI. ROHMM can operate in a range from singlesample to population scale data alike. Materials and Methods: NGS genotype data is from 1000G phase3. 25 deep sequenced whole genome data (10males, 15 females) were processed to collect genotyping results from the X chromosome Non-PAR. Genotype probabilities were integrated into HMM algorithm alongwith dynamic transition probabilities calculated from distances between each locus.Results: Simulation results demonstrated that ROHMM can detect ROHs of varying lengths with great precision and accuracy compared to PLINK, BCFtools, and H3M2. On real population data, ROHMM proved to be as robust as using allele frequencies or sliding window methods. Comparisons between heterozygosity ratio and ROHMM 's inferences have shown a signi cant correlation which supports the integrity of the ROHMM for the population studies. Conclusions: We present a novel approach for the detection of ROHs. ROHMM 's strength comes from the emission parameters deduced from NGS genotype topologyrather than allele frequencies that may contain potential sampling bias, and flexibility for application to any size of data.

Mudge , T. Hunt, J. M. Gonzalez, A. Frankish European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Hinxton, United Kingdom The accuracy of variant interpretation directly relates to the 'trueness 'of gene annotation. However, current annotations are limited in scope and quality, and these de ciencies foster an opaque view of disease biology. We present a drive by Ensembl-GENCODE to radically improve our understanding of disease gene structure and function,deploying a fully integrated, manually supervised work flow incorporating state-of-the-art transcriptomics datasets with enormous tissue coverage alongside targeted proteoge-nomics and in-depth phylogenetic assessment. Crucially, we can speci cally identify 'missing 'gene features that appear most likely to be biologically relevant, and thus ofpotential clinical importance. Previously, our re-annotation of 191 epilepsy genes led to the identi cation of 3 novel de novo SCN1A mutations within a panel of 122 patients with Dravet 's syndrome. We are expanding this work in colla- boration with clinical partners to query additional genes and experimental datasets, and our efforts have now progressedinto gene panels for other diseases. We will present potentially crucial new understandings of genes such as POLG , which is linked to mitochondrial disease. None- insights provided by Ensembl-GENCODE do not ef ciently propagate into the clinic, for two major rea- sons: rstly, genomics projects - both small and large scale - typically utilise older annotations; secondly, investigative work and diagnostics often incorporate a single transcript668 J. del Picchiamodel per gene. We will therefore outline our proposed strategy for the targeted dissemination of new annotation information into different parts of the scienti c community and would welcome feedback on these ideas.

Switzerland,3University Medical Centre Gro- Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,5University Center for Primary Care and Public Health, Lausanne, Switzerland,6Endocrine, Diabetes, and Metabolism Ser- vice, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV),Lausanne, Switzerland Despite the prevalence of many diseases differs between women and men, only few published genome-wide asso- ciation studies (GWAS) have been performed in a sex- stratied manner. Nowadays the molecular bases of sex associated differences in complex traits remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that given the marked causal involvement of gene expression levels in complex traits,sex-biased trait associations might be driven by sex-biased eQTLs.To challenge this assumption, we performed a genome-wide analysis of sex-speci c whole blood RNA- seq eQTLs from 3,447 individuals. Amongst the pre- selected 9 million SNP-gene pairs (based on sex-combined association), we identi ed 18 genes with signi cantly (FDR 5%) different eQTL effects in men and women. PheWAS analyses for these 18 eGenes on >700 traits revealed sex- specic trait-associations for trunk predicted mass. How- ever, such examples are sporadic and sex-speci c expres- sion regulation does not systematically propagate to high-level traits. Next, we applied a sex-speci c transcriptome- wide Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) by combining sex-speci c summary statistics for both eQTLs and complex traits and observed the presence of a com- pensatory effect downstream of gene expression, e.g. genes with stronger eQTLs in women have weaker woman-specic causal effects on complex traits. Finally, we show that the sex-speci c GWAS associations are not driven bysex-biased eQTLs. Our ndings suggest that sex-speci c trait associations can rarely occur as a consequence of sex- specic gene expression regulation in whole blood, hence other omics data are necessary to better understand the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism.

Germany,2Charite - Universitaetsmedizin, Berlin, Germany,3Max-Delbrueck- Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Associa- tion, Berlin, Germany Introduction: Single cell omics technologies present unique opportunities for biomedical and life sciences from lab to clinic, but the high dimensional nature of such dataposes challenges for computational analysis and inter- pretation. Furthermore, FAIR data management as well as data privacy and security become crucial when workingwith clinical data, especially in cross-institutional and translational settings. To facilitate analysis and interpreta- tion of single-cell data by users without bioinformaticsexpertise, we present SCelVis, a flexible, interactive and user-friendly app for web-based visualization of pre- processed single-cell data. Methods: SCelVis is implemented in Python using Dash by Plotly and available as a Python package, via Conda/ Bioconda and as a Docker image under the permissive MITlicense. All components are based on open standards and interfaces, enabling further development and integration with third party pipelines and analysis components. TheGitHub repository is https://github.com/bihealth/scelvis . Results: In SCelVis, users can survey multiple interactive visualizations of their single cell expression data and cellannotation, de ne cell groups by ltering or manual selection and perform differential gene expression, and download raw or processed data for further of fline analysis. SCelVis can be run both on the desktop and cloud systems and accepts input from local and various remote/cloud sources using open protocols. We use SCelVis in connec-tion with an iRODS based omics data management system for interdisciplinary single cell data analysis in translational research and clinical applications. Other users found ituseful to easily create standalone websites that allow efcient exploration of their published data sets.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 669B.

P17.102.A Unveiling Early Differentiation induced by Histone Deacetylase inhibitors in Neuroblastoma cell lines: Services, Udine, Italy The process of tumorigenesis cannot be fully explained solely by genetic alterations. Epigenetic regulation is an underinvestigated basal cause initiating and sustainingcancer cells development. In this context, Histone deace- tylases (HDACs) play a fundamental role in remodeling chromatin and thus regulating gene expression towards cellproliferation and de-differentiation (PMID 21416059). Currently, there are more than 20 HDAC inhibitor drugs approved for cancer treatment or in clinical trials. Theseinhibitors can promote cell differentiation and apoptosis and ultimately reduce cancer cell growth, in ltration and angiogenesis. However, little is known on the early tran-scriptional response induced by HDAC inhibitors, particu- larly in Neuroblastoma. Current transcriptomics lack the ability tounderstand short-term transcriptional responses at a single cell resolution. Here, we measure transcript expression from 2000 single cells from Neuroblastoma cell lines treated withan HDAC pan-inhibitor using 10x Genomics with Cell Hashing and Illumina sequencing. Our analysis of single- cell gene expression pro les detected an increased propor- tion of cells in G1 phase in inhibitor-treated Neuroblastoma cells. Amongst these we were able to identify progressively differentiated and apoptotic cell populations. We also detecta high heterogeneity in individual cells transcriptional response upon drug delivery, linked with short-term rewir- ing and/or the insurgence of resistance mechanisms.

P17.104.C Integrative somatic variant calling in paired FFPE tumor and peripheral blood samples to identify candi- date mutations to follow-up in circulating tumor DNAfor tracking minimal residual disease in localized colorectal cancer patients J. Mart\u00edn Arana 1,2,3, Research Valencia, Spain,2CIBERONC, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain,3Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Unit, INCLIVA Biomedical Research Institute, Valencia, Spain,4Precision Medicine Unit, INCLIVA Biomedical Research Institute, Valencia, Spain,5Depart- ment of Pathology, INCLIVA Biomedical Research Institute, Valencia, Spain Introduction: Mutation tracking in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is used to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in localized colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.Sequencing of tumor-only samples restricts the selection of tracking somatic mutations to those already known to be pathogenic. To increase the number of candidate mutationsto monitor patients, sequencing of paired tumor-normal samples is required. Validation and optimization of different variant calling tools are essential to maximize sensitivity scores. The aim of this work is developing an integrative bioinformatics pipeline to compare the use of only-tumor versus pairednormal-tumor samples to identify candidate somatic muta- tions follow-up ctDNA Tumor Formalin Fixed Paraf- n Embedded ( FFPE) and peripheral blood samples of 150 CRC patients were sequenced using a 29-gene custom panel including Unique Molecular Identi ers technology. For pipeline development, ve different algorithms were tested on a mixture of HapMap cell lines and 2 commercial standards. Results: Smcounter2, LoFreq and Mutect2 reported best sensitivity values. 11% of patients could not be monitored because no pathogenic variants were detected using tumor-only samples, whereas all 150 patients presented at least two somatic variants when adding normal sample data. In addition, paired samples analysis identi ed somatic variants in 16 genes where no pathogenic variants had been previously detected using tumor-only samples. Conclusions: A combination of different variant calling tools is necessary to achieve best sensitivity ranges. Paired tumor-normal sample analysis increases the percentage of patients to be monitored to detect MRD. J.MA contract is founded by CIBERONC.670 J. del PicchiaJ. Mart\u00edn Arana: None. R.

Research Grant (principal investigator, collaborator or consultant and pending grants as well as grants already received); Modest; of prediction methods for intronic SNVs in next generation sequences Quintas-Rey de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain Introduction: Alterations in splicing sites (ss) are estimated to explain approximately 10% of human disease causal variants. Mutations outside the ss but affecting \"regulatory elements \"can be up to 25%. Accurate deleteriousness prediction for intronic variants is crucial for diagnostic purposes. Many deleteriousness prediction methods havebeen developed, but their relative values are still unclear in practical applications. We comprehensively evaluated the predictive performance of two complementarydeleteriousness-scoring methods using information from real patients. Material and Methods: We selected the dbscSNV (both ADA and RF scores) and SPIDEX algorithms, that study variants in splicing consensus regions or in regulatory regions respectively. The tools, either alone or in combina-tion, were tested on 29294 gene intronic SNVs that have been genic \"(430) or \"benign \"(28864). The sensitivity, speci - city and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Moreover, we applied the algorithms to WES data from undiagnosed patients, and we analysed themRNA sequence from genes that tted the patient 's phenotype. Results: The highest sensitivity corresponds to dbscSNV with 96.55% while the best speci city is for SPIDEX with 95.78%. When considering the 3 scores (SPIDEX,dbscSNV ADA and RF Score), the sensitivity and specicity values were 60.7% and 94.6%. The Positive and Negative Predictive Value were 14.45% and 99.39%. The results for 20 undiagnosed cases are presented. Conclusions: Besides the low positive predictive value, the combination of both algorithms leads less than 1% offalse negatives, so their routine use can be recommended for diagnostic purposes. R.

Black1 1University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 2University College London, London, United Kingdom, 3Manchester Universities NHS Foundation Trust, Manche- ster, United Kingdom,4University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom Purpose: To develop a comprehensive analysis framework to identify pre-messenger RNA splicing pathogenic variants in the context of rare disease. Methods: We ascertained variants of uncertain signi - cance (VUS) through clinical multi-disciplinary team meetings, and de ned an accurate in-silico strategy for the prioritization of variants impacting splicing through com-parison to functional analyses. We retrospectively applied these prioritization strategies to a large cohort of 2783 individuals who had previously received genomic testingfor rare genomic disorders, and assessed clinical impact. Results: We identi ed 21 VUS that potentially impacted splicing, and used cell based splicing assays to identifythose variants which disrupted normal splicing. We established the comparative utility of 9 in-silico strategies for variant prioritization. We analysed 1,346,744 variantsidenti ed through diagnostic testing for 2783 individuals, and observed that clinical impact is highly dependent on the specic incorporated in-silico prioritization strategy. We show that incorporation of one of these strategies into diagnostic testing would improve clarity in clinical analysis for 15% of the individuals surveyed. Prioritized variantscould provide new molecular diagnoses or provideAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 671additional support for molecular diagnosis for up to 81 individuals within our cohort. Conclusions: Incorporation of an in-silico and functional analysis framework for splicing pathogenic variants improves clarity in diagnostic reporting, increases diagnos- tic yield and, with the advent of targeted treatmentstrategies, can directly alter patient clinical management.

Spyrou, K. Kyriacou, A. Hadjisavvas The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus Introduction: Germline genetic testing can identify women with pathogenic mutations who are at increased risk of BC. However, genetic testing may reveal a variant of uncertainclinical signi cance (VUS). These variants pose signi cant challenges for clinicians since, their ambiguous association with disease interferes with effective genetic counseling.Although, in-vitro characterization of these variants should be performed, it is often not feasible to carry out functional interpretation for every single VUS. To this end, we con-ducted a comprehensive in silico analysis of the structural, functional and stability impact of the PALB2 p.Leu1143His VUS which was identi ed in 9 Cypriot BC patients with extensive family history of the disease. Materials and Methods: A combination of structural bioinformatics tools were used for the in silico classi cation of the PALB2 p.Leu1143His VUS. Results: Stability analyses based on G calculations (10 prediction tools) predicted a destabilization of themutant PALB2 protein. The substitution from the non- polar, hydrophobic Leucine to the positively charged, hydrophilic Histidine, results in a minor change of thesurface charge and conformation. Both amino acids are exposed to the surface (cut-off value: Relative Solvent Accessibility -RSA > similarvalues (71.3% and 83.1%) upon mutagenesis. Results on protein stability and structure end up being contradicting.Conclusions: Although in silico tools are valuable for the interpretation of VUS, functional studies are needed to draw more de nite conclusions on variant classi cation.

P17.108.A Towards a better understanding of the low discovery rate of short-read based insertion variant callers W. Enfant, 38043, Grenoble, France Since 2009, numerous tools have been developed to detect structural variants using short read technologies. Insertions are one of the hardest type to discover and are drasticallyunderrepresented in gold standard variant call sets. The advent of long read technologies has completely changed the situation. In 2019, two independent cross technologiesstudies have published the most complete variant call sets with sequence resolved insertions in human individuals. Among the reported insertions, only 15% could be dis-covered with short-read based tools. In this work, we per- formed an in-depth analysis of these unprecedented insertion call sets, in order to investigate the causes of suchfailures. We have rst established a precise classi cation of insertion variants according to three different layers of characterization: the nature of the inserted sequence, thegenomics context of the insertion site and the breakpoints junction complexity. Because these levels are intertwined, we used simulations to characterize the impact of eachcomplexity factor. Most reported insertions exhibited characteristics that may interfere with their discovery: 50% were tandem repeat expansions, 40% contained homologieslarger than 20 bp within their breakpoints junctions and 70% were located in simple repeats. Consequently, the recall of short-read based variant callers was signi cantly lower for such insertions (7% vs 54% for mobile element and novel insertions). Simulations showed that the most impacting factor on the discovery rate was the insertion typerather than the genomics context, and that the different factors of insertion complexities were handled differently depending on the chosen tool.672 J. del PicchiaW.

Reinert1,2 1Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany,2Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany Introduction: The identi cation of structural variation in the genome is dif cult due to the lack of a \"perfect \" sequencing technology. By combining short and long readsequencing data, Vaquita-LR is a novel bioinformatics approach to identify more variants with higher accuracy by utilizing the strengths of one method to overcome theweaknesses of the other. Materials and Methods: Vaquita-LR is an extension of Vaquita, a short read variant caller, which has beenmodied to identify potential variants in long reads in addition to short reads and merge them to provide a nal set of variants. Vaquita-LR takes into consideration the readdepth, read length, and other characteristics of the sequencing data to add weight to more con dent calls. Additionally, it adapts techniques from Pilon to improve theaccuracy of the long read data using relevant short read information. Results: By combining short and long reads, Vaquita-LR is able to outperform other structural variant callers, including meta callers which combine results from other callers. Importantly, supplying long reads is effective atsequencing depths as shallow as 1x. Using this combination allows Vaquita-LR to better lter out false positives while retaining true positives, providing a better list of possiblecausal variants for further investigation. Conclusions: With the abundance of data available today, it is important to consider how the data can beeffectively merged to better serve our needs. Vaquita-LR is an initial step in showing the usefulness of integrating different sequencing data types when identifying structuralvariants. J.J.

Articial intelligence and machine learning methodologies have been used to investigate the molecular characteristics of diseases. It has been reported that subnetwork markers are reliable with high accuracy in disease classi cation. Materials and Methods: We developed and used a subnetwork-based method to identify network markers for Saudi colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Whole-genomegene expression and copy number alterations (CNAs) datasets were gathered from publically available databases. We then performed an integrated analysis of mRNA andCNA datasets followed by a gene interaction network analysis using several publically available databases. We clustered the identi ed gene network into subnetworks and calculated an activity score for each signi cant subnetwork. The scores were then used as feature values to build a support vector machine (SVM) classi cation model. Results: The integrated genomic analysis revealed 24 differentially expressed genes with CNAs. Network analy- sis revealed 15 signi cant subnetwork markers associated with CRC. The SVM classi er using individual marker genes showed 94.7% accuracy, whereas the classi er with the subnetwork markers achieved 98.4% accuracy inidentifying CRC patients. Furthermore, we validated the prognostic potential of our subnetwork markers on independent CRC datasets with detailed clinical data. Conclusions: Subnetwork markers that are based on integrated genomic and network analyses yield more robust and accurate classi cation results compared to gene markers.

P17.111.A ePOSSUM2: A web app for predicting the impact of DNA variants on transcription factor bindingAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters Germany,2The Jackson Laboratory, Farmington, CT, United States Modelling gene regulation is a major challenge in biome- dical research. Mutations in transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) may cause the misregulation of genes, even- tually leading to disease. In 2016, we published a study that compared the ability of 179 binding models for 82 human transcription factors to identify experimentally veri ed\"real\"in vivo binding sites derived from ENCODE ChIP-seq data. Our results showed that several models do not reliably detect TFBSs. Using these results, we created ePOSSUM, a web application forpredicting the impact of DNA variants on transcription factor binding. Here we present an update of the application. ePOSSUM2 has been rebuild from the ground up with a modern C ++ back-end that runs many computations in milliseconds. In ePOSSUM2, web users can easily upload VCF les to identify and rank variants that most likely affect gene expression. ePOSSUM2 supports more than 4,000 different binding models, including transcription factor flexible models. It features an improved log-weighted matching algorithm that takes into account the wild-type dinucleotide distribution surrounding matching sites. For each variant,ePOSSUM2 predicts the effect on transcription factor binding. To account for the poor performance of several binding models, it also reports a negative or positivepredictive value. ePOSSUM2 is freely available at: A centralised storage solution for case- management and variant interpretation for diagnostictargeted next generation sequencing data J. Adams 1,2, Trust, Exeter, United Kingdom,2Univer- sity of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Analysis of panels of genes associated with particular clinical indications by targeted Next Generation Sequencing(tNGS) is offered routinely in diagnostic laboratories to maximise the likelihood of nding a genetic diagnosis. In2019, Exeter Genomics Laboratory (EGL) performed tNGS testing for approximately 2000 patients, generating hun- dreds of variants per patient requiring secure storage and interpretation. Ef cient variant prioritisation and inter- pretation is essential for delivering a timely diagnosis which can be facilitated by cross-referencing results from previouspatients and applying ltering strategies based on ACMG variant classi cation guidelines. Historically, data for each patient has been stored independently, limiting the ability todetect trends across patients and utilise information from previous analyses. Here we present TaPAS, a variant interpretation interface and centralised data store for variants identi ed using EGL's in-house tNGS bioinformatics pipeline. Built using the Django framework based around an SQL database,TaPAS dynamically lters and displays variants based on the intrinsic characteristics of the variants and ACMG variant classi cation criteria, with JavaScript elements used to access external databases and manipulate local programs such as Alamut \u00aeVisual and IGV to visualise variants. It maintains a historical record of previous analyses, display-ing variant frequency in the patient cohort, previous variant classi cations and allows the application of additional panels to the data as required. TaPAS streamlines theprocess of variant classi interpretation and reanalysis of tNGS data and reduces turnaround times. J. Adams: None. M. Owens: None. M. Sloman: None. A. Moleirinho: None. K.

P17.114.A Using transcription factor sequence information to interpret rare variants in non-coding regions H. K. Zieger , F. Thieme, Schmidt, J. Fazaal, E. Mangold, J. Welzenbach, K. Ludwig Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany Common diseases are characterized by variants from dif- ferent parts of the allelic spectrum. While common risk variants are identi ed by GWAS, the conclusive identi - cation of causal private/rare variants remains challenging. Collapsing rare variants into groups, as performed in gene burden analyses, is dif cult for non-coding regions, due to the lack of functional annotations. Here we combine rese- quencing data of non-coding regions with information of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), to identify noveletiological variants and molecular players in non-syndromic lip with/without palate (nsCL/P). We used data of674 J. del Picchia691 European cases and 854 European controls, in which functional candidate regions at three GWAS risk loci (total 56.7 kb) had been resequenced using molecular inversion probes. Based on 624 rare variants (MAF<1%) and position weight matrix information, we predicted TFBS for 810 human transcription factors from JASPAR2020. Of the 370motifs that were hit by at least one rare variant (total number: 4,013), 21 motifs were hit signi cantly more often in cases compared to controls. When integrating the pre-dicted allelic effect on TF binding capacity, we identi ed an additional set of nine TFs where in aggregate the variants ' effects on the motif were stronger in cases. Across bothapproaches, consistent effects were observed for TF motifs of FOXO6 and ZEB1, suggesting them as molecular players in nsCL/P at these loci. This analysis framework willimprove systematic evaluation of rare variant data and can be extended to large data sets, such as from whole genome sequencing studies. H.K. Zieger: None. F.

Kairov Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Center for Life Sciences, National Laboratory Astana, Nazarbayev University, Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan Introduction: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a matrix factorization method for data dimension reduction. ICA has been widely applied for the analysis of tran-scriptomic data for blind separation of biological, environ- mental and technical factors affecting gene expression. This study aimed to analyze cancer data using the ICA foridenti cation and comprehensive analysis of reproducible signaling pathways and molecular signatures in cancer. Materials and Methods: In this study, four independent cancer transcriptomic GSE32701 and used. R Bioconductor and Matlab have beenused for normalization. A bioinformatics tool \u00abBiODICA - Independent Component Analysis of Big Omics Data\u00bb was applied to compute independent components (ICs). GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and ToppGene uncovered the most signi cantly enriched pathways. Construction and visualization of gene networks and graphs were performedusing the OFTEN method, Cytoscape and HPRD database.Results: The correlation graph between decompositions into 30 ICs was built with absolute correlation values exceeding 0.15. Clusters of components - pseudocliques were observed in the structure of the correlation graph. Top 500 most contributing genes of each ICs in pseudocliques were mapped to the PPI network to construct signalingpathways for gene interaction. Some cliques were com- posed of densely interconnected nodes and included components common to most cancer types, while otherswere common to some of them. Conclusions: The results of this investigation may reveal potential biomarkers of carcinogenesis, functional subsys-tems in the tumor cells, and helpful in predicting the early development of a tumor.

P17.116.C Single and cross-tissue conditional transcriptome wide analyses reveal independent and shared susceptibility genes for psychiatric traits and in flammatory bowel diseases C. Maj 1, F. Uellendahl-Werth2, O. Mucha2,S and (IGSB), Bonn, Germany,2Institute Clinical Molecular Biology, Christian Albrechts University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany, 3Institute of Computer Science, Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Rostock, Kiel,Germany, 4Institute of Computer Science, Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Rostock, Germany, Rostock, Germany,5Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, School of Medicine & University Hospital, Bonn, Germany,6Norwegian PSC Research Center, Department of Transplantation Medicine, Divisionof Cancer Medicine, Surgery and Transplantation, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway Introduction: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identi ed hundreds of signi cantly associated loci for different psychiatric and in flammatory phenotypes. Note- worthy, genetic correlations have been reported for these traits indicating the presence of potential shared molecular mechanisms. Materials and Methods: We performed transcriptome- wide association study (TWAS) based on the largest available GWAS results for a number of psychiatric andinflammatory traits using the uni ed test for molecular signature (UTMOST). We conducted multi-phenotypeAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 675TWASs by considering single and cross-tissue expression signals based on cis-eQTL. We selected 23 relevant tissues for brain and gut traits from GTEx, STARNET, and BLUEPRINT databases. Single tissue associations were combined by means of the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test and we performed genome-wide conditional analysis todetect independent TWAS signals at loci with multiple TWAS hits. Results: A relatively high number of genes were found to be associated with the analyzed traits. We observed strong inflation of TWAS signals most likely due to correlated predicted expression among same-locus genes. Geneprioritization based on genome-wide conditional analyses strongly reduced the number of associated genes and highlighted speci c associations including known risk genes (e.g., SMAD3 for in flammatory bowel disease). Interestingly some genes are associated both with brain and gut related phenotypes suggesting common regulationmechanisms of the gut-brain axis. Conclusions: TWAS was able to prioritize gene- associations in multiple psychiatric and in flammatory traits supporting commonly regulated genes of the gut-brain axis. Noteworthy, Conditional analysis at loci with multiple TWAS hits can discriminate between spurious associationsdue to correlation and true-association signals. C. Maj: None. F.

It provides a set of tools for sup- porting the full work flow from (i) variant data quality control, (ii) variant ltration and (iii) ef cient assessment of variants based on visual alignment inspection andannotation data such as functional and frequency annota- tion. The system allows to organize data into a folder structure of projects with access control. Variant quality metrics can be displayed project- (and thus cohort-) wise or for single cases/families. The variants themselves can be ltered based on genotype, population frequency, variant effect, quality metrics, and annotation such as membership in ClinVar or HGMD Public. A special ClinVar-centric view allows for the easy screening of variants based onpathogenicity annotation in ClinVar. After ltration of the variants, their quick and ef cient assessment is supported by various tools: color flags and commenting allows for simple yet effective note-taking, remote-controlling the genome viewer IGV to display a variant 's locus, and some important database excerpts are available directly within thesystem. Assessment documentation according to ACMG- AMP is also supported. Further, link-out to external data- bases (e.g., ENSEMBL or NCBI), allow the assessment ofvariants using MutationTaster, SIFT, or various splice site assessment tools. Filtered data sets can be downloaded as VCF or Excel les (including comments and flags) or submitted to external tools such as MutationDistiller.

P17.120.A Variant Record Fusion: a bioinformatics pipeline for Tumor-only NGS testing in clinical routine S. Lehnert 1, Belgium Here we present a novel approach for the detection and ltering of variants for NGS cancer diagnostic tests without tumor matched normal samples. A combination of different variant callers allows a wider set of variant types to bedetected. Current approaches that make use of different variant callers rely on merging or concatenating individual sets of variant calls that have high con dence for a speci c caller. This approach however, needs to tradeoff between low sensitivity or speci city for variants that have lower condence calls in individual variant callers, but are still true variants. Our approach obviates this problem by fusing normalized and decomposed variant-records of all different676 J. del Picchiacallers to allow ltering of individual variants based on the information from all different callers. Variants in the fused dataset are subsequently ltered using parameters speci ct o the individual caller, to a combination of different callers and to the combined variant calls of the entire run. The pooled likelihood matrixes of different callers in fusedvariant entries proved to be especially useful for categor- izing low frequent variant calls (AF < =5%). This pipeline was brought in clinical routine for a solid tumor gene paneland a hematological malignancy gene panel. We used 3 variant callers (uni ed genotyper (2x) and MuTect) and dened over 20 lter rules. Only 2 from 25 cutoffs required a slight adaptation between the two different sample tests with different sample types, FF and FFPE, indicating a general applicability of this approach. S.

P17.121.B CADD-Splice - Improving genome-wide variant effect prediction using deep learning derived splice scores Rentzsch 1,2, M. Schubach1,2, - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany,3Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle, WA, United States,4Department of Genome Sciences, Seattle, WA, United States The assembly of genomic exons into mRNAs via splicing is of critical importance for the correct synthesis of proteins. As such, genomic variants in splicing regions have been linked to various genetic diseases. In order to assist theidenti cation of splice altering variants from genetic data, a number of methods aim to predict splicing effects. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achievebetter results on predicting splice variants genome-wide. However, these methods have been barely adopted in genome-wide variant effect prediction. We use the Multiplexed Functional Assay of Splicing using Sort-seq (MFASS) dataset to assess several new machine learning methods that score variant splicingeffects. To build a general variant effect model, we integrate two of those approaches into our genome-wide variant prioritization tool Combined Annotation Dependent Deple-tion (CADD, cadd.gs.washington.edu), that weights and integrates a diverse collection of other annotations. We show that the new DNN scores improve prediction across multiple variant categories. While splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, thespecialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as these also account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. This suggests that by integrating domain-speci c informa- tion from for example splice scores, variant prioritization can generally be improved. We believe that this effect isuniversal and outlines the importance of developing domain specic scores for regulatory sequences, UTRs or non- coding RNA species. P. Rentzsch: None. M. Schubach: None.

Johnson2,C. Colombo3, M. A. Bekritsky2, M. A. Eberle2, D. R. Bentley3 1UCLA, Biological chemistry, Los Angeles, CA, United States,2Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, United States, 3Illumina UK, Cambridge, United Kingdom Clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) pipelines must deliver quanti ably accurate and reproducible variant calls. Publicly available truthsets allow labs to measure variant calling performance in curated sets of samples. Truthsetgeneration methods seek to exclude any problematic genomic regions that may contain both stochastic and sys- tematic errors from the source samples. In clinical variantcalling, complementary standards to identify high- and low- condence sites are needed in order to detect systematic effects that generalize to any sample. With increased sequencing throughput, we can query population-level sequence data to obtain 1000s of indepen- dent per-site measures. To test this approach, we collectedmetrics (e.g. base quality, depth and mapping quality) from >30 samples and trained a logistic regression model to learn the relationship of quality metrics to small variant callingaccuracy. When applying the model to independent samples, we found that it can effectively discriminate regions of high,medium and low predicted accuracy, as well as identify common deletions regions. Of the non-N autosomal genome, we predict ~91%, ~2%, and ~5.4% has low accuracy, SNP concordance is >99.95%, >86.5%, >62.1% and >80.5% respectively, demonstrating the validity of theapproach, which is further supported by performance assessment using the Platinum Genomes truthset.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 677Proling systematic error proves a promising approach to predict per-site variant calling accuracy and annotate variant and invariant bases. This will reduce the need for orthogonal validation of calls and the curation burden, making clinical WGS quicker, less expensive, and more reliable. T.U. Dincer: A.

Juhos1, Garcia1, Uppsala, Sweden Introduction: High throughput sequencing for precision medicine is now a routine method. Numerous tools have to be used, and analysis is time consuming. We propose Sarek, an open-source container based bioinformatics work flow for germline or matching tumor-normal pairs, written in Next- flow, to process WGS, whole-exome or gene-panel samples. Materials and methods: Sarek is part of nf-core, a collection supported It is system- agnostic: can be used on single machines, clusters (HPC) orin a cloud such as AWS, with little difference between setups. Additional software can be included as new modules. Several model organism references areavailable (including Human GRCh37 and GRCh38). The pipeline is by ASCAT andControl-FREEC. Furthermore, a broad set of QC metrics is reported at the end of the work flow with MultiQC. Results: From FASTQs to annotated VCFs it takes three days for a 90X/90X sample on a 48 cores node. Sarek is used in production at the National Genomics Infrastructure Sweden for germline and cancer samples for the SwedishChildhood Tumor Biobank and other research groups. Conclusions: Sarek is an easy-to-use tool for germline or cancer NGS samples, to be downloaded from https://nf-co. re/sarek under MIT license.

J. van Rooij, L. Broer, J. Verlouw, F. J. A. van Rooij, R. Kraaij, A. G. Uitterlinden, A. J. M. H. Verkerk Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, NetherlandsIntroduction: We studied the penetrance of pathogenic classi ed variants in an elderly Dutch population from the Rotterdam study for which deep phenotyping is available. We screened the 59 actionable genes for which reporting of \"known \"pathogenic variants was recommended by the ACMG, and demonstrate that determining what constitutes as a\"known \"pathogenic variant can be quite challenging. Methods: We de ned known pathogenic as classi ed pathogenic by both ClinVar and HGMD. In 2,628 individuals, we performed exome sequencing and identi ed known pathogenic variants. We investigated the clinicalrecords of carriers and evaluated clinical events during 25 years of follow-up for evidence of variant pathogenicity. Results: Out of 3,815 variants detected in the 59 ACMG genes, 17 variants were considered known pathogenic by both and HGMD. For 14/17 variants the ClinVar classi cation had changed over time. We identi ed 24 carriers of these variants, which were con rmed by Sanger sequencing. In only three participants (13%) we could observe at least one clinical event possibly caused by thevariant.678 J. del PicchiaConclusions: We show that the de nition of \"known pathogenic \"is often unclear and should be approached carefully. Additionally variants marked as known patho- genic do not always have clinical impact on their carriers. Denition and classi cation of true (individual) expected pathogenic impact should be de ned carefully. J.G.J. van Rooij: None. L. Broer: None. J. Verlouw: None. F.J.A. van None. None. None.

ADME variation has been char-acterised across European and Asian populations, but data relative to African populations are available only for a few ADME genes. Materials and Methods: We present the rst study aiming to characterise the pharmacogenomics landscape of all ADME genes in sub-Saharan Africa using 458 highcoverage whole genomes and other publicly accessible datasets. Results: Our study shows a signi cant level of variability in ADME genes. We identi ed 930 potential high impact coding variants, most of which are rare and discrete to asingle African subgroup. Signi cant frequency differences (i.e. >10%) are seen in common high impact variants between subgroups. For some of the novel variants, we show that their impact could be deleterious at the protein structure level. Copy number variation was detected in 116 ADME genes, with equal ratios of duplications/deletions.For variants of known clinical outcome, we note that most of these are rare in Africa compared to European populations, potentially re flecting the underrepresentation of these groups in past research. Conclusions: Our work highlights that the ADME landscape in African populations is diverse and shows theimportance of rare variation held within individual popula- tion clusters. The \"genetic diversity bottleneck\" in precision medicine might increase the burden in developing targetedtherapies at sub-population levels. Moreover, current array- based genotyping technologies have severe limitations to be applied as the main method in precision medicineapplications. H. Othman: None. J. da Rocha: None. G. Botha: None.

We investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk ofexacerbations in adult patients with asthma, adjusted for anti-in flammatory treatment effects. Methods: Ten SNPs which previously associated with asthma, change in lung function or exacerbations in children, were investigated within adults with asthma from the population-based Dutch Rotterdam study ( n=588) with replication in the American GERA cohort ( n=9,842). Hurdle regression models were used in the analysis to account for both the incidence and the frequency ofexacerbations. All models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, smoking, treatment step according to GINA guidelines and the interactionbetween ICS use and the genotypes. The Logarithm of the follow-up time was used as an offset variable. P values less than 0.005 were considered , previously associated with FEV 1change) were signicantly associated with an increased subsequent exacerbation risk in count models in both adult asthmatic cohorts.(rs7216389 Discovery Rate Ratio(RR): 1.67;p exacerbations in the Dutch cohort, and signicantly the American cohort.

Up to 50-60% of differences in sensitivity to therapy in asthmapatients is due to genetics. We studied polymorphisms in genes involved in the metabolism of glucocorticoids of GLCCI1 gene in asthma patients and healthy individuals. The study was conducted in 350 children with asthma and 363 non-atopic children of different ethnicityfrom the Volga-Ural region of Russia. Genotyping was carried out by RT-PCR. The methylation status of the promoter region of the GLCCI1 gene was determined based on bisul te conversion of DNA, the methylation-sensitive melt curve analysis and sequencing of samples with dif- ferent levels of methylation. The p= 0,02, OR =1,74) in Tatars was de ned. We found the association of the TBXT *rs2305089 Tallele with asthma in Bashkirs ( p< 0,05). Hypermethylation of the promoter region of the GLCCI1 gene was detected only in asthma patients ( p=0,02, OR=15,1). Patients with an increased level of with low level of the GLCCI1 gene methylation. These results suggest that GLCCI1, TBXT, FBXL7, MAGI2 genes play an important role in the glu- cocorticoids pathway and pathogenesis of asthma.

However, the genetic variation involved in severe asthma exacerbations in this population remainsscarcely explored. Aim: To perform an admixture mapping and ne mapping of severe asthma exacerbations in AfricanAmericans. Methods: A total of 970 African American asthma patients (448 exacerbators and 522 non-exacerbators) genotyped withthe Axiom LAT1 array (Affymetrix) were analyzed. Local ancestry was assessed with ELAI for 412,603 SNPs using data from Yorubans as reference panel. Association of localancestry with asthma exacerbations was assessed with logistic regression models. A p1.63 x 10 4was used to declare signicance based on the number of independent ancestry blocks. Fine mapping was performed with data imputed to the, 1000 Genome Project reference panel. Association of polymorphisms and exacerbation status in the last 12 monthswas assessed by binary logistic regression with correction for age, sex, asthma severity and global African ancestry. Results: African ancestry at chromosome 3q27.3-28 was associated with exacerbations. The strongest association (p=3.79 x 6, odds ratio: 1.84, 95% con dence interval: 1.42-2.39) was located in the region containing the LPP gene, which has been previously associated with asthma. Additionally, ne mapping identi ed three common poly- morphisms that remained signi cant after multilocus correction for the number of effective tests. Conclusions: African ancestry and three polymorphisms at 3q27.3-q28 are associated with asthma exacerbations.Future work will include evaluation of rare variants and replication in independent studies.

P18.09.A Genetic variability of antioxidant mechanisms and late adverse events of breast cancer radiotherapyK. Goricar 1, J. T. Stojanov 1Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia,2Faculty Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Radiotherapy enables good long-term local control and survival in early breast cancer patients. How- ever, some patients experience acute or late adverse eventsthat can affect treatment protocol and decrease patient 's quality of life. Genetic factors can contribute to the inter- individual variability in occurrence of adverse events. Asradiation leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species, contributing to oxidative stress, our aim was to evaluate the association of common polymorphisms inantioxidant genes with late adverse events of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Our study included 101 HER2- positive early breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. We isolated DNA from buccal swabs and genotyped c PCR. Association of polymorphisms with adverse events was evaluated using logistic regression. Results: Median follow-up after radiotherapy was 4.0 (2.6-5.4) years. In total, 33 (32.7%) patients reported grade2 late adverse events according to LENT-SOMA criteria, and 12 (11.9%) experienced grade 2 skin toxicity according to CTC criteria. Late adverse events were signi cantly more common in carriers of at least (OR =2.71; 95% for clinical variables. Conclusions: Polymorphisms in antioxidant genes were associated with adverse events of radiotherapy and could serve as biomarkers contributing to the personalization of radiotherapy in breast cancer Research Dolzan: None.

P18.12.A Development of a Point of Care Test for CYP2C19 Al- lowing Genotype Guided Antiplatelet Prescribing to Prevent Recurrent Ischaemic StrokesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 1Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, Manchester, United Kingdom,2Genedrive PLC, Manchester, United Kingdom,3Manchester Centre for Health Economics, Manchester, United Kingdom,4Greater Manchester Com- prehensive Stroke Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom Background: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication recommended for secondary prevention of ischemic strokes and transient ischemic attacks in the UK. Activation isrequired via the P450 cytochrome system, of which CYP2C19 is a major component. CYP2C19 is highly polymorphic, with over 30 loss of function (LOF) alleles.Evidence suggests that outcomes could be improved if individuals with LOF alleles were prescribed alternative antiplatelets. We aimed to develop a point of care test(POCT) to identify CYP2C19 status in a clinically relevant timeframe, model the effect of implementation and capture patient views on acceptability. Methods: An asymmetric PCR was designed to amplify CYP2C19 alleles prior to melt curve analysis using fluorescent hybridisation probes. The assay was developed on the Genedrive \u00aerapid thermocycler using synthetic DNA target templates before validation with genomic DNA. A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was used to assessthe indicative incremental costs and consequences of genotype-guided prescribing, compared with current prac- tice. A of variation. This POCT identi es metaboliser status in <60 minutes via Qualitative evidence suggested genotype-guided prescribing was acceptable topatients. Indicative economic analysis suggested genotype- guided prescribing has the potential to improve health outcomes and save resource, but a de nitive trial is required. Conclusions: This assay identi esCYP2C19 metaboliser status in a clinically relevant timeframe. The assay isportable, non-invasive and facilitates tailored antiplatelet prescribing in the acute care setting. J.H. McDermott: None. Ainsworth: A. Employment (full or cant; Genedrive PLC. S.

Esquivel, G. Elnashar , V. Tam, J. Sheard, J. England, J. Sevlie, M. Donaldson, B. Metzger, B. Hartung OneOme, Minneapolis, MN, United StatesIntroduction: Throughout world populations, different allelic frequencies of CYP2D6 have been observed. CYP2D6 is a prominent phase I metabolizing pathway that mediates up to 25% of clinically used drugs. The goal ofthis study was to identify CYP2D6 allelic frequencies in an ethnically diverse patient population. Materials and Methods: DNA samples were collected from 8457 participants who consented to receive the RightMed Comprehensive test (OneOme, USA). The RightMed Comprehensive test report provides pharmaco-genomic interpretation for 27 genes (111 alleles) and guidance on 300 +medications. CYP2D6 genotypes and their respective predictive phenotype interpretation wereanalyzed. of a total of 8457 participants, 68.9% self- identi ed as White or Caucasian, 4.4% as Hispanic or Latino, 3.4% as Asian, and 2.6% as Black or African American. The remaining 19.1% of participants selected Unknown or did not provide ethnicity. Poor metabolizers(PMs) with an activity score (AS) of 0 were identi ed in 7% of individuals identifying as White, 5% of those identi ed as Hispanic or Latino, 1% of Asian individuals, and 1% ofBlack or African Americans. Overall, 6% of the total participants were classi ed as PMs. Conclusions: Pharmacogenomics has become a valuable clinical tool for more effective prescribing by diminishing the risk of adverse drug reactions for several medications resulting in increased success. CYP2D6 plays an essentialrole, and with more than 110 allele variants, the frequencies fluctuate among populations. Ultimately, for a better understanding and proper implementation, broader allelecoverage and accurate collection of sub-ethnicities is needed. B. Esquivel: A.

Introduction: Diagnosis of monogenic diabetes has important implications for diabetes precision medicine andhealth expenditure. Its prevalence in many countries remains unclear, although young-adult non-autoimmune diabetes is increasing. Here, we conducted a transnationalmulticenter study to identify rare pathogenic mutations causing monogenic diabetes in young-adults, and to assess the diagnosis rates, genetic subtypes and speci cities between countries. Materials and Methods: We performed exome sequen- cing in 204 unrelated diabetic cases (age-at-diagnosis:26.1 \u00b1 9.1 years) clinically selected by 30 medical centers in eleven Mediterranean countries. Rare coding variants in 35 targeted genes were evaluated for mutation pathogenicityusing American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. One-way ANOVA, chi-squared test, principal component analysis and factor analysis of mixed data wereused for data analyses. Results: Fourty pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) mutations were identi ed in 36 patients yielding an overall genetic diagnosis in 17.6% of the participants. GCK (37.5%), HNF1A (27.5%), ABCC8 (12.5%) and HNF4A(7.5%) mutations accounted for the majority of cases. We found country wise highly variable diagnosis rates (up to 40% in Greece) and interestingly a higher mutation rate in European ancestry participants. Lower body mass index and HbA1c level at study inclusion, and less insulin treatment at diagnosis and inclusion are hallmarks of the mutationcarriers. Conclusions: In practice, our ndings impacted patient long-term monitoring and therapeutic regimen. They alsohighlight broad clinical and genetic spectrum of young- onset diabetes in Mediterranean countries.

P18.19.B Comparison of EGFR mutation detection among FFPET, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples in patients with non-small cell lung Cancer I. Dimitrova1, N. Yanev2, S. Bichev1, Kostadinov2,A . Savov1 1National Genetics Laboratory, So a, Bulgaria,2Medical University of So a, Department of Pulmonary Diseases University Hospital for Pulmonary Diseases \"St. So a\", Soa, Bulgaria Background: FFPET samples remain the golden standard for EGFR genotyping. In many cases the initial material is insufcient. In those cases EGFR genotyping could be done on BAL or blood samples. In the last few years liquid biopsies prove to be reliable method for EGFR character- ization, on the other hand cytology samples are not usedthat often. In this study we compare the detection rate of EGFR mutations in BAL and blood samples compared to FFPET samples. Materials and Method: For a period of 9 months 10 patients with EGFR activating mutations have been selected. DNA extraction was performed with QiaAmpCirculating Nucleic Acid kit for plasma and BAL samples. For FFPET samples we used QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit. EGFR genotyping was performed with Plasma tissue RGQ PCR Kits.684 J. del PicchiaResults Discussion: conrmed based on EGFR genotyping in FFPET samples. 6 patients had deletions in exon 19, 3 had L858R substitution in exon 21 and one patient had G719x in exon 18. In 9 cases mutations were con rmed in corresponding BAL samples and they were detected in only 4 plasmasamples. In 1 case, in both liquid biopsy samples- BAL and plasma, we found T790M mutation along with deletion in exon 19, but not in the corresponding FFPET sample. Conclusions: This study shows that BAL samples are superior to plasma samples and almost equal to FFPET samples in detecting EGFR mutations, therefore cytologysamples should be preferred before blood samples when possible.

Belmont1 1Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, United States,2Precision Health Economics, Los Angeles, CA, United States Introduction: Our understanding of the genetic etiology of many rare diseases has grown substantially in recent years. However, there has been little real-world evidence pub-lished regarding the epidemiology and care delivery of patients with suspected rare genetic diseases at the popu- lation level. The objective of this analysis was to char-acterize the population of patients with indications of rare genetic diseases in a large US healthcare claims database, with a focus on utilization of genetic testing. Materials and Methods: This retrospective administra- tive claims analysis used the Optum Clinformatics database. A total of 12,023,329 patients met inclusion criteria,including continuous enrollment. Curated lists of ICD-9 and ICD-10, CPT codes, and other billing codes were generated to identify patients with indications of suspectedgenetic diseases. Combinations of variables were used to dene patient cohorts for analysis, with different levels of stringency used to de ne wider vs more conservative cohorts. Separate analyses were completed on critically-ill infants and other pediatric patients. Results: Up to 12% of pediatric patients (1,450,702) and up to 53% of critically ill infants (26,322) had indicators of genetic disease. Across all cohorts, only a small minority of patients received any genetic testing \u2014between 3 to 9% based on different cohort criteria. Mean time to rst genetictest was >350 days for pediatric patients and >140 days for critically-ill infants. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight the substantial patient population with indicators of suspected genetic diseases, but notably, a signi cant underutilization of genetic testing. B.

Methods: We analyzed all 6,291 Rotterdam Study (RS-I base line cohort) Caucasian participants with 25 years follow-up, containing 1,177 knee and 561 incident hip 11-SNPs shared. Standardized PRSs (zPRS) were constructed to estimate the odds ratiosper standard deviation (SD) of zPRS for each subject, weighted by effect sizes and adjusted for age/sex. ExternalAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 685validation was performed in the clinical Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK), and RS-II and RS-III cohorts. Results: The zPRS for the incident HipOA was predicted ( p=6.2\u00d7104;OR=1.4) with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.59. When the zPRS wereadded to the predictive AUC of 0.68 for age/sex, it increased to 0.70. The for KneeOA only predicted prevalent KneeOA ( p=1.5\u00d710 6;OR=1.2). The top 10% of the zPRS compared to the rest of the population had a 2 times higher risk for HipOA incidence ( p=7.7\u00d7104) and 50% higher risk for KneeOA incidence ( p=3.7\u00d7102). Conclusions: Our work shows the potential of PRS as a clinical prediction tool for prevalent and incident knee and hip OA. B. Sedaghati-khayat: None. J.G.J. van Rooij: None. C. G. None.

Rodenburg1 1National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Centre for Health Protection, Bilthoven, Netherlands, 2National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Centre for Population Screening, Bilthoven, Netherlands Introduction: The potential bene ts of population-based genomics are considered substantial, but little is knownabout the type, nature and scale of national genomic plans. We aimed to describe ongoing genomics initiatives identi- ed in middle and high-income settings. Methods: A convenience sample of countries was selected based on expert referral and google searches. Data was extracted and collated covering diverse items ofinterest: country, type and scope of the initiative, funding, participants, aims, activities, inception and conclusion date, drivers and actors involved. Results: A sample of 25 countries was included and a total of 30 initiatives were found. Most have a national scope ( N=27) and focus on Prevention and Screening as well as on Diagnostics and Treatment ( N=10). If the initiative is national, then it is often population-based. Models are varied, from funding platforms to government-lead initiatives, as well as individual research projects. In some countries, there is full public funding while others opt for public-private-partnerships. The scale of nancingvaries largely, depending on the span of activities: research, infrastructure, development of genomic testing and analysis, as well as capacity-building and education. Drivers and actors involved also differ depending on the nature of the initiative, but universities and health research centres often have a leading role within consortia or networks. Conclusions: There is not a one-size ts all approach to genomic plans. Countries seem to design initiatives according to their priorities. However, lessons learned andarguments for a certain model can hold valuable informa- tion for individual countries and international genomic plans. T. Leonardo Alves: None. M.E. Jansen: None. W.

Numerous studies showed that the SNPrs12979860 of IL28B gene is clearly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV, but not that of HBV. However, only few studies were done in very small numberof people to reveal the possible effect of SNP rs12979860 genotypes in case of HDV infection. In this study, we did comprehensive statistical analysis to show whether there isa relationship between SNP rs12979860 and spontaneous clearance of HDV using relatively large number of people. Methods: Total of 820 participants including of 3 groups (HDV spontaneously cleared n=215, HDV chronic n= 304 and healthy n=301) were participated in this study according to their serological and molecular biologicaldiagnostic results. For each participant, SNP rs12979860 was genotyped by RFLP and Sanger sequencing. Pearson 's chi square test and odds ratios were applied for assessingthe association between SNP rs12979860 and spontaneous clearance of HDV. Results: Our results are shown as following table.686 PicchiaGenotype HDV clearedHDV chronicHealthy HDV cleared cleared chronic vs. healthy OR 95% CI OR 95% CI 47 32 Conclusions: Our analysis showed that spontaneous clearance of HDV is not dependent on the genotypes ofrs12979860 polymorphism.

P18.26.C Identi cation of novel genetic risk factors in the conserved haplotype region surrounding the LCT locus on chromosome 2q21 Pathophysiol- ogy Trasplantation, Milan, Italy Introduction: Inhibitors development affects about 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A (HA). Different envir-onmental and genetic risk factors are involved in this pro- cess.[1,2] Recently, we identi ed a SNV (rs3754689) in the LCT gene potentially linked with this predisposition.[3] Since this variant is benign [4] and is located in a conserved haplotype block, we hypothesized that the association signal captured by this variant is probably located in coinherited,neighboring genes like R3HDM1 ,UBXN4 andmiRNA-128- 1, previously linked with autoimmune disorders and there- fore potential clinically relevant targets. The aim of thisstudy is to identify novel genetic risk factors associated with inhibitor development in R3HDM1 ,UBXN4 ,CXCR4, MCM6 ,miRNA-128-1 genes in patients with severe HA. Materials and Methods: 246 Italian patients with severe HA with (72) or without (174) inhibitor was sequenced byTruSeq Custom Amplicon (Illumina). Data were analyzed according to the guidelines reported by the Broadinstitute (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/ ). Statistical analysis was performed by Plink, PlikSeq. variants passed the quality controls: 56 common (MAF 1%) and 172 rare (MAF<1%). Logistic regression of common variants con rmed the protective role of the rs3754689 missense variant. Other 4 variants resulted signicantly associated. Two are localized in LCT,a genomic region involved in the regulation of the UBXN4 expression. Rare variants resulted not associated. Conclusions: This study con rmed the association of the chromosomal region around the LCT locus with inhibitor development in patients with severe HA. Further investiga- tions are necessary to evaluate the expression of targetgenes and miR-128-1. A. Cairo: None. S. Spena: None. E. Pappalardo: None. M. Mancuso: None. F. Peyvandi: D. Speakers biomarker for early hepatocellularcarcinoma using integrated cross-species genomic and network analyses I. H. 1, 1AlFaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,2King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,3AlMaarefa University, College of Medicine, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer originating in the liver and third- leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The disease is mostly diagnosed at advanced stages, hence haspoor prognosis. Robust biomarkers are therefore urgently needed for early diagnosis and prognostic estimation. Materials and Methods: We performed integrated genomic and network-based analyses of early HCC (eHCC) using genome-wide gene expression pro ling datasets from human eHCC samples and eHCC rat model. The validationof diagnostic and prognostic value of the identi ed gene signature was done using independent datasets of gene expression pro ling of tissue samples as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with eHCC.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 687Results: We identi ed 41-gene signature that is con- served across species and expressed in blood. We validated the diagnostic and prognostic potential of the gene signature on independent datasets with detailed clinical data. We developed a prognostic model based on our gene signature that demonstrated that the high expression was signi cantly associated with poor disease outcome. Multivariate regres- sion analysis revealed that our gene set predicted the disease outcome independent of other clinical factors. Conclusions: Our results suggest that integrated cross- species genomic and network analysis may provide a robust methodology to identify key biological programs associatedwith eHCC and may lead to improved diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic options.

AmericanCollege of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) has published recommendations for reporting incidental nd- ings in selective genes. We report incidental ndings from 500 whole exomes performed for clinical/diagnostic purposes at a private laboratory in Brazil and discuss potential impact in lifeexpectancy. Information about potential life expectancy impact of early diagnosis of genetic conditions was reviewed from cost-effectiveness studies available in theliterature: we considered a potential increase of 21 years in life expectancy for variants in congenital cardiomyopathygenes, 7.6 years for long QT and 6.0 years in highly penetrant breast cancer genes. Incidental ndings in genes enlisted by ACMG were found in eight patients (1.6%), including four variants in genes associated with cardiac not calculated: CHEK2, RAD51C, BRIP1 ). We estimate that the reports of incidental ndings may have increased life expectancy in our cohort by 88.6 years, or 0.18 year per cohort patient. Since general accessibility to genomic testing is increasing, analysis of clinically-actionable conditions show potential bene t for public health policies in the future. C.R.D.C. Quaio: A.

Weersma1 1UMCG, Groningen, Netherlands,2Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Boston, MA, United States Introduction: More than 240 genetic loci have been asso- ciated with In flammatory bowel disease (IBD), but little is known about how they contribute to disease development ininvolved tissue. We hypothesized that host genetic variation affects gene expression in an in flammation-dependent way. Materials and Methods: We investigated 299 snap- frozen intestinal biopsies from in flamed and non-in flamed mucosa from 171 IBD patients. were determined using wholeexome sequencing and genome wide genotyping. In total, 28,746 genes and 6,894,979 SNPs were included. Linear mixed models identi ed 7,667 intestinal cis- expression quantitative trait loci ( cis-eQTLs) (FDR<0.05) and interaction analysis revealed 122 in flammation- dependent intestinal cis-eQTLs (FDR<0.05), including several for known IBD-risk genes and genes encoding immune-cell receptors and antibodies. The in flammation- dependent cis-eQTL SNPs mainly interact with prevalence of immune cell types. Conclusions: Inflammation-dependent intestinal cis- eQTLs reveal genetic susceptibility under in flammatory conditions that can help identify the cell types involved and the underlying pathways, knowledge that may guide future drug development and pro le patients for precision medicine in IBD.

Colak3 1King Faisal School, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,2King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,3King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Introduction: Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the main leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts forabout 85% of lung cancer diagnoses, which enforces the importance of diagnosing NSCLC patients reliably and as early as possible in order to reduce the risk of mortality. Materials and Methods: We identi ed blood-based gene markers for NSCLC by utilizing an integrated analysis of global gene expression and copy number alterations ofNSCLC patients using array-based techniques. The gene signature was then validated using independent datasets of gene expression pro ling of over 1000 NSCLC patients. We also validated the classi cation performance and the prognostic potential of the gene signature using independent datasets with detailed clinical information. Results: The high expression of our gene signature is associated with a poor disease outcome. Signi cantly altered functions, pathways, and gene networks inNSCLC-associated genes revealed alterations in several cancer-related pathways that may have importance for NSCLC transformation, further validating our gene signa-ture's diagnostic and prognostic potential. Conclusions: Our ndings suggest that integrated genomic and network analysis is likely to provide a reliableapproach to identify genes that are associated with NSCLC and may lead to improved diagnosis and therapeutic options, without any invasive procedures required.

Leveraging genetic information could improve the success rate of drug clinical trial. Previous work showed that molecules with genetic evidence of association with the disease have greater chance of being eventually approved,and that adverse effects can be partially predicted from genetic associations. Here, we argue that multitrait genome- wide association studies (GWAS) is a powerful frameworkfor harnessing genetics to inform drug targeting by: 1) increasing power to identify new drug targets; 2) associating drug targets with biological pathways through clustering;and 3) suggesting drug targets with no indication of likely adverse effects. We conducted a multitrait GWAS of metabolic (lipid and http://jass.pasteur.fr/index.html ). identi ed 405 signi cant associations, detected six multitrait association signatures (i.e. clusters of geneticvariants with similar association pattern) and associated each signature with metabolic pathways. We investigated the links between the identi ed multitrait association sig- natures and coronary heart diseases (CHD). Signatures associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, low density lipoprotein or triglycerides were also signi cantly associated to CHD. Conversely, signatures associated to high density lipoprotein did not exhibit protective effect on CHD. These conclusions were concordant with past orongoing random control trials on probucol, cetrapid, alirocumab, ezetimibe, and volane- sorsen. list, for signatures associated withCHD, of druggable genes with their associated metabolic pathways that have not been investigated yet.

Mubarak King Faisal specialist hospital and Research center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Despite over 2 decades of Parkinson 's disease (PD) research, the genetic picture remains unclear. Until now, no universal risk variant(s) have been found. At least 40 dif-ferent loci have been implicated in PD from genome-wideassociation studies and an equal number of candidate genes have been revealed by whole exome sequencing-based studies. Thus, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of PD. Moreover, most of the large scale studies have been con- ducted in European or Asian cohorts and their ndings rarely replicated across populations. Therefore, inclusion ofnon-European data sets is necessary not only for validating previous ndings but also for variant/gene discovery. Genetic studies on complex neurodegenerative disorders inArabs are lacking. Here we report on the rst comprehen- sive genomic study on 60 PD cases of Arab descent. A three-stage analysis strategy was tailored to detect rarevariants in PD. By applying this strategy, 125 new variants affecting 117 genes were identi ed in 85% of the cases. All of the genes have not be previously linked to PD except two(EIF4G1 andATP13A2 ). Further prioritization of our data generated a list of high con dence variants in 20 genes involved in neuronal function and/or having mouse modelswith relevant phenotypes. B.R. Mubarak: None. P18.43.B How can we capture clinical variation and progression in deeply phenotyped patient cohorts? C. Sandor 1, S. Millin2, A. Dahl2, Lawton3, Hubbard1, Cardiff, United Kingdom,2University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom,3University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom,4Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, United Kingdom Introduction: There is large variation in the clinical pre- sentations and progression between patients with the same disorder. The generation of deeply and longitudinally phe- notyped patient cohorts offers an enormous potential toidentify disease subtypes with prognostic and therapeutic utility. Material and Methods: Using three large cohorts of Parkinson 's disease (PD) patients with extensive clinical observational data repeatedly collected over many years, we developed a Bayesian multiple phenotype mixed modelincorporating the genetic relationships between individuals that was able to reduce a large number of diverse clinical measurements into a smaller number of continuous under-lying factors ( \"phenotypic axes \"). This approach overcomes many limitations associated with clustering methods and better re flects the more continuous phenotypic variation observed amongst patients.690 J. del PicchiaResults: We identify three principal axes of PD patient phenotypic variation which are reproducibly found across three independent, deeply and diversely phenotyped cohorts. Together they explain over 75% of the observed clinical variation and remain robustly captured with a fraction of the clinically-recorded features. The mostinfluential axis was associated with the genetic risk of Alzheimer 's disease (AD) suggesting PD patients with a high genetic risk for Alzheimer 's disease are more likely to develop a more aggressive form of PD including dementia symptoms. Conclusions: Our approach has the potential to accelerate our understanding of how disease manifests and progresses. This approach provides universal disease benchmarks through which patients may be appropriately compared,through which the underlying disease-modifying mechan- isms can be understood and appropriately strati ed, and personalised therapeutic strategies and treatments can bedeveloped.

Wick 1, F. sanne, Switzerland We report the case of 78-year-old woman with a 3rdepisode of a toxic icteric hepatitis (liver parameters 4-7x). Each occurrence was after surgical intervention and post-operative infections, necessitating antibiotics and analge- sics (paracetamol, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid). Personal history: coronary heart disease coronary stent 3 years previously. Drug history: led to no improvement; the patient continued to feel weak and remained icteric even after 4 weeks. She was screened for variants in 33 pharmacologically- relevant genes (MyPGx). Results predicted Poor Metabo- lizer/Low Function haplotypes, the MyPGx algorithm predicted possible increased toxicity/risk of side effects for both valsartan and atorvastatin. Valsartan is principally excreted unchanged (80%) but is also metabolized by CYP2C9, which showed a decreased function in the patient (*1/*2). Taking into account these results, valsartan was replaced by olmesartan and atorvastatin by rosuvastatin; in both cases the alternative drug belonged to the same class but thekey pharmacogene is SLCO1B1 (normal function, *1A/ *1B). After only two days the patient felt \"as good as before \"; within 4 weeks, liver transaminases sank to quasi- normal values. The complex genetic ndings suggest several interactions initially caused by post-operative drugs but knowing the predicted activity of key pharmacogenesfacilitates selection of the best treatment leading, in this patient, to reversing the toxic reaction she was experiencing.

Chung1 1Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong,2Department of Surgery, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong,Pokfulam, Hong Kong Introduction: Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is an important area of precision medicine. Currently, lack of large-scale exome/ genome-wide data precludes clinical application of pre- emptive PGx testing in Chinese. In this study, we analyzeknown and novel variants in clinically actionable pharma- cogenes on the HKU Pediatric Exome Cohort in Hong Kong. Methods: WES data of 1,132 unrelated Chinese subjects were analyzed using a two-tiered approach. The 1st-tier analysis targeted known PGx variants based on a list of 135curated actionable variants. The 2nd-tier analysis focused on discovery of rare, predicted deleterious variants in 108 genes with PharmGKB Level 1/2 evidence based on 4bioinformatic tools on missense (CADD, REVEL and variants in the curated variant list, comprising of 57 drug-geneAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 691combinations. The most (30.6%). Of the 1,132 Chinese subjects, 98.9% harbored at least 1 known actionable PGx variant (media n=3). Additionally, we discovered 561 rare variants in 108PharmGKB Level 1/2 genes with diversi ed functional effects such as non-synonymous nucleotide substitution ( n =520), premature gain of stop n=33) and disruption of reading frame ( n=8). Conclusions: We have shown the abundance of known and novel functional PGx variants that are potentiallyclinically actionable. This study addresses the research gap of inadequate Chinese samples by large-scale PGx studies and also demonstrates the feasibility of secondary usage ofWES data on PGx. olanzapine may induce dysregulation of the glucose utilization through the alteration of the Myc signalling as detected by RNA-seq expression analysis of treated healthy volunteers M.

Materials and Methods: An open, controlled, rando- mised, crossover clinical trial in healthy volunteers was carried out to evaluate the short-term effects (5 days) ofolanzapine and aripiprazole in healthy volunteers. Blood samples were collected before and after each treatment. A total of 48 samples were analysed with Illumina total RNA-Seq technology, followed by differential expression analyses. Results: A euclidean distance heatmap grouped the 4 samples from 4 volunteers, suggesting a lack of effect due to the treatments while separating the samples of the other 8 volunteers. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GSEA) showed the opposite effect of aripiprazole and olanzapine on the expression of Oxidative phosphorylation and Myc targets gene sets (p <0.001). While aripiprazoleproduced a Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) of -2.9 and -2.4 respectively, olanzapine produced a NES of 4.9 and 5.7 respectively. The Myc network coordinates thecellular utilization of glucose by regulating the mitochon- drial mass and activity. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the volunteers could be strati ed according to their response to the treatments. Both aripiprazole and olanzapine may induce dysregulation of the glucose utilization due to the alterationof the Myc signalling. Further validation is ongoing.

We aimed at using recall-by-genotype (RbG) to leverage polygenic risk scores (PRS) for low bone mineral692 J. del Picchiadensity (BMD) and osteoarthritis (OA) seeking to enhance transcriptome differential expression analyses (DEA). Materials: Whole-tissue bone samples were obtained from either trans-iliacal biopsies or femoral head fragments as part of hip replacement surgery in 121 participants. BMD was measured at the Total Hip (TH-BMD) and Total Body(TB-BMD) using DXA. Transcriptome pro ling was done on all samples using RNA-sequencing. Iliac samples ( n= 71) were genome-wide genotyped. DEA was done bygrouping participants into cases and controls based on either on TH-BMD T-values (<-2.5 and >-1.0 respectively) or OA status. Weighted PRS were constructed for TB-BMD andOA. DEA was repeated on transcriptome pro les using RbG targeting the upper and lower PRS quintiles. Results: Higher expression of SOST and DKK1 was observed in patients with higher BMD replicated by both approaches (phenotypic and recall-by-genotype grouping). The latter approach also identi ed differential expression of TPBG andMEPE . can enhance transcriptome DEA when used in a RbG framework. Further, the approach allows triangulation of functional genomics evidence implicating shared and independentpathways underlying osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.

Objective: We propose a model on how to distinguish, contact and return high-risk genetic ndings to biobank participants. Methods: Genotype- rst approach was applied to identify carriers of pathogenic variants in BRCA1 /2genes and offer return of results with genetic counselling to theEstonian biobank participants. We evaluated the long-term effect of reporting actionable genetic ndings. Results: 22 of 40 carriers contacted opted for receiving results. 18 of 21 appreciated being contacted; three were unsure. 10 had relatives attending cascade screening. Within one year, ve of 16 female carriers opted for risk-reducing surgery. Over follow-up of 30 months, 10 adhered to surveillance recommendations. Only eight of 21 quali ed for high-risk assessment based on clinical criteria. Discussion: This study highlights the signi cance of population genomic studies for personal early risk evalua- tion. It provides evidence for the genotype- rst approach to improve long-term outcomes for individuals, unaware of their high genetic risk. We demonstrate that biobank participants as well as their family members appreciatereceiving results that exempli es how individuals from general population would respond.

Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Paris, France Rare diseases are individually rare but globally affect about 6%% of the population according to the latest calculations. Recent estimates point to over 10000 rare diseases, of which 6172 disorders are listed in Orphanet, 71.9% of which beinggenetic and 69.9% having paediatric-onset. These diseases ' rarity is contextual, varying with the population considered and also geographically. Nonetheless, disease rarity uni-formly translates into a delayed diagnosis, with 25% of patients having to wait for 5 to 30 years to have one. It is essential, at the time of diagnosis, to be able to relayinformation about potential gene and variant-speci c therapies to patients. \"Solve-RD - solving the unsolved rare diseases \"is a research project funded by the European Commission for ve years(2018-2022) aiming at improving the diagnostic and therapeutic management of rare diseases. It will deliver seven implementation steps, including onededicated to treatment as part of the \"genetic knowledge web\". With this in mind, we propose a method of allowing clinicians to access this information promptly to bene t patients affected by rare disease and their families. The \"- Treatabolome \"is an evidence-appraised database of rare diseases treatments for speci c genes and variants to be made available through genetic diagnosis and support tools, for example, the RD Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis Platform. The Treatabolome aims at contributing to raisingawareness and increasing the visibility of existing rare diseases 'treatments to clinicians.

The detection of pharmacogenetic markers of treatment response may be useful in predicting clinical response to psoriasis therapiesand would help in the improvement of personalized therapy. The aim of the present study was to assess the association rs3213619, rs2229109, rs1128503, rs2032582 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ABCB1 gene with response to cyclosporine treatment in Russian psoriasis patients. Materials and Methods: DNA samples were collected from 168 patients with psoriasis. Genotyping of SNPs was performed by real-time polymerase using theCFX 96Real-Time Cycler (BioRad, USA). For case- control association study we used \u00b2 tests with Pearson contingency tables were implemented in PLINK version1.06 to compute the P-values and corresponding odds ratios (OR) with 95% con dential intervals (CI) for allelic association. Results: The variant rs1045642 in the ABCB1 gene showed an association with a negative response tocyclosporine therapy (OR =2.58, 95% CI =1.64-4.06) in Russians. Carriers of the dominant model (TT +CTvsCC) have 1.6-fold higher risk (OR =4.01, 95% CI =1.82-8.98) of no response to cyclosporine treatment (TTvsCC +CT) model (OR =2.50, 95% CI =1.14-5.50). larger studies are required to conrm our ndings and replicate them in various populations before implementation in the clinical practice.

P18.59.C Prevalence of actionable germline variants within a 53- gene inherited cancer risk gene panel in a cohort of 2,642 cancer patients classi ed by an AI inference engine F. M. De La Vega 1, T. Friedrich1, S. Nohzadeh- Malakshah1, M. G. Reese1, C. Frise1 1Fabric Genomics, Oakland, CA, United States,2Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States Implementation of cancer risk gene tests continues to grow driven by new reimbursement pathways and technological advances. However, disagreement exists on what genes andpopulations should be screened, their clinical utility and the cost/bene t of such tests. This debate should be informed by an understanding of the prevalence of cancer risk var-iants in different population cohorts. Here we analyzed germline variants from a cohort of 2,658 patients with 38 different types of cancer, whose tumor and matching normalgenomes were sequenced as part of the ICGC PanCancer Analysis project. We identi germline variants within the regions of anexpanded 53-gene hereditary cancer risk panel, which includes genes associated with breast, ovarian, colon, prostate, lung, and other cancers. For expedited and con-sistent assessment of variant pathogenicity, we utilized a recently developed arti cial intelligence-based forward- chaining inference engine, with a subset of the ACMG criteria for manual review. Overall 5% of cancer patients were carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, with pre-valence higher in patients of renal cell, pancreas adeno- carcinoma, ovarian, breast, and liver cancers. A higher frequency of the P/LP variants was observed in the genesATM, KCHN2, BRCA1/2, and PMS2. As population screening for cancer risk is being actively discussed byAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 695healthcare stakeholders, our results illustrate that previously established guidelines could miss people with potentially actionable variants.

P18.60.A Exploring secondary ndings in Spanish cohort of patients undergoing whole exome sequencing Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Exome-sequencing is being used across diverse clinical settings allowing primary diagnosis but also screening for unrelated disorders. The ACMG (2017) recommends offering the analysis of 59 medically action-able genes (secondary ndings, SFs). However, little is known about acceptance rates and penetrance of SFs in patients without family history. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients ( n=641) who underwent exome-sequencing in a Spanish tertiary center from May 2017 to September 2019.During pretest genetic counseling all patients were offered to know SFs or to opt out. We analyzed acceptance and detection rate. In addition, we reviewed type of ndings and family history. Results: The great majority of patients opted to receive SFs. A secondary nding was identi ed in 11 patients (1,7%). Pathogenic variants were found in genes studies indicated that all variants were inherited with exception of one de novo variant in RYR2 . Only one family ( BAG3 ) met criteria for an a priori genetic testing. In the rest of cases, carriersevaluated so far had no personal/family history and showed no signs of the disease. Conclusions: Our results show a high acceptance for the return of SFs. Virtually none of the variants would have been a priori identi ed, since most patients did not have family history to justify speci c genetic testing. Further clinical evaluation is being performed to assess penetrance of SFs in the absence of family history. M. Codina Sol\u00e0: None. E. Rovira Moreno: None. L\u00f3pez Paramonov: None. None. P18.61.B Impairments of smell perception: the role of sex, age and genes M. Concas1, T. Battistuzzi2, M. -IRCCS ''Burlo Garofolo Italy,2Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy,3Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy Smell de cits affect quality of life leading to loneliness and depression and represent an early symptom of neurode-generative diseases. Here, we investigated the role of age, sex and genetics factors in smell perception in a large Italian cohort (1155 individuals). Smell ability was assessed usingthe SNIFFIN 'sticks test. Number of errors (NoE) was counted and a linear mixed model applied to evaluate the influence of age and sex. A mean NoE of 1.76 \u00b1 1.65 was detected. Male sex and increased age were associated with a greater NoE ( p< 0.05). A subset of subjects (802 out of 1155) was analysed by WGS to detect human Loss ofFunction variants (LoF). The number of biallelic LoF mutations (NoM) on 35 olfactory receptors (OR) genes (27 of which clearly expressed in the olfactory epithelium) wascounted and subjects (228) grouped accordingly. The NoM was 4.19 \u00b1 1.99, while NoE was 2.54 \u00b1 1.95. Age accounts for 22% of the variability in NoE, while NoM has noimpact. Excluding elderly people ( 70 y, n=75) from the analysis, we found that NoE increases with NoM, sug- gesting a strong role of genetics factors. NoM explains 6%of NoE variability, while age only 4.9% ( p< 0.05). Ourndings con rm age as a strong factor in fluencing smell de cits, and, for the rst time, highlight the role of genetics factors (i.e. mutations in OR genes) in predisposing to smell de cits in the general population. Moreover, we696 J. del Picchiashowed that at a given time, the aging process has such strong impact that exceeds the individual 's genetic predispositions. M. Concas: None. T. Battistuzzi: None. M.

Tobin1,C Batini1 of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom,2Leicester NIHR BRC, Institute for Lung Health, Department of Infection, Immunity &Inflammation, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom Background: Varenicline is partial agonist to the 42 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are involved in nicotine-induced reward pathways, dependenceand withdrawal. Varenicline is the second most commonly prescribed smoking cessation medication after nicotine replacement therapy, and has the greatest therapeutic ef - cacy. We present the rst case-control candidate gene study of varenicline effectiveness using EXCEED, a cohort of ~10,000 individuals based in the UK. Methods: An electronic phenotyping algorithm using prescription Read Codes in primary care data linked to EXCEED participants was used to identify individuals withvarenicline prescriptions ( N=185). Cases and controls were de ned as smokers at 1 year follow up and non- smokers at 1 year follow up, respectively. We tested 198 tag SNPs, spanning 12 biologically relevant candidate genes encoding proteins involved in varenicline activity and metabolism. Results: Seven SNPs were associated with varenicline effectiveness at nominal signi cance (P < 0.05), but none passed the Bonferroni corrected threshold. These SNPswere located in nAChR subunit genes CHRNA4 ,CHRNB4 and CHRNA7 , and have not been previously reported as associated with varenicline effectiveness or smokingbehaviour traits. Future work: This study was limited by statistical power due to low sample size. Therefore, we intend to use thesame approach to ascertain case-control status for indivi- duals with varenicline prescriptions using primary care data linked to ~230,000 UK Biobank participants. This will formthe foundations for a genome-wide association study toidentify unbiased genetic associations with varenicline effectiveness. K. Coley: None. Q. Wang: None. R. Packer: None. C. D.J. L.V.

Guney Eskiler 1, Z. Ozman2 1Sakarya University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Sakarya, Turkey,2Sakarya University, Institute of Health Science, Department of Sakarya, Turkey Introduction: The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)-reti- noblastoma (RB) pathway plays a vital role in the pro- gression of breast cancer (BC). Therefore, CDK4/6inhibitors have great attention as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BC. On the basis of genetic feature, there is a strong associations between TN phenotype andBRCA1 mutation status. However, the effectiveness of CDK4/6 inhibitors in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has not been fully examined in terms of BRCA1 mutation status. Therefore, we explored the therapeutic effects of abemaciclib on two different TNBC cells and identi ed the underlying mechanisms of apoptotic cell death. Materials and Methods: The cytotoxicity, Annexin V, cell cycle and RT-PCR analysis were performed to determine anti-cancer effects of abemaciclib on HCC1937(BRCA1 mutant) of TNBC cells in a dose and time dependent manner (p < 0.05). However, HCC1937 cells were more sensitive to abemaciclib than MDA-MB-231 cells. After 24 hourstreatment with 1.5 M abemaciclib, the percentage of total apoptotic cells was 63.5% and 11.7% in HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. We observed that accumulated effects on TNBC cells and BRCA1 mutation status increasedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 697therapeutic ef cacy of abemaciclib.

Perola1,3, K. 1Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Fin- land,2University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,3Research Program for Clinical and Molecular Metabolism, Facultyof Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Introduction: In P5 FinHealth study we have population-based study cohort FinHealth. We estimated participants 'polygenic risk scores (PRSes) and ten years total risks for venous thromboem-bolism (VTE) and returned the information to participants via internet portal. In the process we studied how the known VTE predisposing variant Factor V Leiden affects the riskof VTE in the presence of PRS. Materials and Methods: Our VTE PRS, containing 6.5 million genomic variants, was based on UK BiobankGWAS summary statistics and adjusted for the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with Python package LDpred. We generated PRSes also separately for Factor V Leidencarriers and non-carriers. We used Cox regression to estimate the effects of genetic (PRS) and traditional (e.g. gender, age, smoking, BMI, prevalent CHD or T2D) riskfactors on future risk of VTE event in a follow-up cohort reclassi- cation improvement (NRI) analysis showed that the model with PRS correctly re-classi es cases in both groups: carriers ( p=0.009) and compared to a model without PRS. Conclusions: In our study we show that VTE PRS offers additional value to VTE risk estimation even in the presence of the known VTE predisposing variant Factor V Leiden.We have returned personal genetic and absolute 10-year risk estimates and instructions for their health care for the P5 participants in February 2020.

Henggeler1, G. Matyas1 tics, Schlieren-Zurich, Switzerland,2Laboratory of Transla- tional Nutrition Biology, ETH Zurich, Schwerzenbach, Zurich, Switzerland Introduction: In the current genomics era, interpretation of high-throughput sequencing data constitutes the main bot- tleneck on the path to accurate diagnosis of Mendeliandisorders. Large-scale reference cohorts such as ExAC/ gnomAD are valuable for the population-frequency-based ltering of the myriad of detected sequence variants. Using the example of brillinopathies, such pathogenic FBN1 / FBN2 sequence variants in ExAC/gnomAD and the largest Swiss database of Marfan genomes, respectively. Methods: By focusing on a priori (likely) pathogenic sequence variants in ExAC/gnomAD, we calculated prevalence estimates for MFS and CCA. Furthermore, wescreened whole genomes (60\u00d7 WGS) of ~550 patients with rare (aortic) disorders for (likely) pathogenic and functional sequence variants in FBN1/FBN2 , and 12 pharmacogenes, respectively. Results: We show the presence of pathogenic FBN1 /2 variants in the apparently healthy reference cohort ExAC/gnomAD, providing prevalence estimates for MFS and CCA. In our Swiss cohort, we identi ed two families with dual FBN1/FBN2 mutations, explaining the variable phenotype within these families including clinical features of MFS and CCA (PMID:31506931). In one family, we also detected a pharmacogenetically actionable variant in adrug metabolizing enzyme. Conclusions: Our results not only demonstrate that apparently healthy reference data sets may include indivi-duals with late-onset or unrecognized disease, but also show thatbrillinopathies occur more frequently than expected and may co-occur. Furthermore, we emphasize theimportance and increasing possibility of detecting digenic and, as an added value, pharmacogenetically relevant sequence variants using WGS. S.M. Caspar: None. A. :None.

Sabaghzadeh1, S. Sadat2, A. Bolhassani2 1Islamic azad university of tehran medical branch, faculty of advanced sciences & technology, Tehran, Iran, IslamicRepublic of, 2Pasteur institute of iran, department of hepatitis and AIDS, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Human immunode ciency virus (HIV) which causing acquired immune de ciency syndrome (AIDS) is one of the main universal health concern. In spiteof using antiretroviral treatments, there are no authorized HIV vaccines. The development in using therapeutic pro- teins is affected by the limitation on permeability andselectivity of cell membranes. Thus, utilizing cell- penetrating peptides as protein transfection reagents or protein transduction domains (PTDs) has beenexpanded. Hsp27 as intracellular chaperones motivate ef cient immune responses. Material and Methods: Following by the con rmation of the plasmid construct HIV-1 Nef-MPER-V3-LDP12- pET-28a enzymes digestion,applying prokaryotic expression, SDS-PAGE and western- blotting were utilized. Next, the target protein was puri ed on Ni-NTA agarose column, dialyzed transfection, 4 \u00d7 10 4HEK-293T cells/well were used and supplied by complete DMEM medium. Then LDP12-Nef-MPER-V3, Nef-MPER-V3,Hsp27-GFP-turbofect and GFP-turbofect were applied to each well and assessed by western-blotting. Results: The gene 's presence was con rmed by digestion as 825 bp band and sequencing. Moreover, western-blot analysis indicated a desired expression of Nef-MPER-V3 as ~54,~27, ~37, respectively. Our data showed the signi cantly expression of fusion constructs in Rosetta strain and also, was accurately puri ed under denaturing condition. Conclusions: Briefly, this stable construct (LDP12-Nef- MPER-V3) with high cellular penetrance and low toxicitycould be used as a favorable procedure in HIV-1 vaccine strategy, that is suf ciently capable of inducing speci c strong immune responses.

Kawafune2, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,2Genequest Inc, Tokyo, Japan,3Genome Analytics Japan Inc, Tokyo, Japan Introduction: The 12q24 locus, East Asian-speci c linkage disequilibrium (LD) region, includes ALDH2 gene which involves in alcohol metabolism. It has been reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ALDH2 ,r s 6 7 1 ,i s associated with various dietary behaviors (DBs), susceptibilityto diseases and clinical measurements including BMI. The purpose of this study was to investigate how the pleiotropic effects of 12q24 affect human health through DBs. Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva samples of 12,315 Japanese subjects and genotyped by SNP array. We collected data aboutresidential area, sex, age, and 56 DBs by Web questionnaire survey. The sex-strati ed phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) for rs671 P< 0.05/56). Results: The that 7 DBs were signi cantly associated with rs671 in male and female, respectively. After adjusting for alcohol intake frequency, 6 DBs in male and 2 DBs in female were signicantly associated with rs671. Almost all associations with DBs, except for coffee intake, were attenuated by adjustment of alcohol intake frequency. The mediation analysis revealed that 5 DBs in male and 3 DBs in femalewere mediated between alcohol drinking and BMI. Conclusions: This study showed that the 12q24 locus affects BMI through complicated pathways with andwithout the mediation of alcohol drinking. Furthermore, it was suggested that sex-speci c DBs was involved in the pathway. Our ndings can contribute to personalized nutrition using rs671 in East Asians.

P19.005.C Variants associated with Alzheimer 's disease develop- ment revealed by analyzing genome data of healthyindividuals and Bulgarian supercentenarians D. N. So Bulgaria Introduction: Alzheimer 's disease (AD) is predominantly a disease of the elderly and is a major cause of dementia, slowly progressing towards disability and death. Genetic studies are mainly related to the search for single mutationswith a pathogenic effect, as well as separate variants of genes that would modify the risk of developing symptoms earlier or later in life. Materials and methods: DNAs from 32 centenarians (100 to 106 years) and 61 healthy individuals aged 18-30 years have been exome sequenced in two separate pools.1930 variants from DisGeNet database known to be associated with AD have been searched. Results: Five pathogenic variants have been found in young healthy control group: rs63750264 in APP gene is associated with early onset AD, while rs145999145 in PLD3, rs72470545 in HTRA2, rs2070045 in SORL1,rs429358 in APOE are associated with late onset AD. Conclusion: Centenarians are a model of a \"good quality of life \"and most of them do not show any manifestations of dementia. They are \"gold standard\" for revealing protective genetic variants or absence of pathogenic/risky ones, the latter considered a triggering mechanism to unlock AD. Ouranalysis shows that young healthy individuals carry risk variants for predisposition to AD. This suggests that the exome screening is useful for early diagnosis and preven-tion of neurodegenerative disorders. Acknowledgements: Contract DN 03/7 ScienceFund of D.N. Nikolova: None. D.

Musta n2 1Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: The study of ancient human DNA is rapidly developing, although research on ancient samples at the level of paleo-populations is almost not conducted. One of the dif cult regions of Eastern Europe 's ethnogenesis is medieval Russia. The aim of this research is to obtain the Y- chromosomal STR-haplotype of an individual buried in the XII century on the territory of the Tver Kremlin and com-pare it with the haplotypes of modern populations. Materials and Methods: We used bone fragments and teeth from individual found in the burial of the earlynecropolis, wherein 1285 the construction of the Trans g- uration Cathedral in the Tver Kremlin took place. The burial was formed before the construction of the cathedral, whichis con rmed by radiocarbon analysis: date from the 12th- 13th centuries. The methods were used in the work: DNA was extracted on a Silica Spin column; capillary electro-phoresis and the Y ler\u00aePlus kit were used to determine the lengths of polymorphic STR-loci of Y-chromosome. Results: A Y-chromosomal STR-haplotype was obtained. Of the 25 loci included in the Y ler\u00aePlus kit, 23 loci are identi ed. Analysis using predictors shows that this haplotype belongs to the haplogroup R1a1a1b1a1a(M458). An analysis of publications revealed 3 identical haplotypes by 16 common loci in populations: the Russian of Ivanovo and Penza regions, the southern Germans. Conclusions: This study con rms the possibility of studying Medieval Russia samples. The haplotype is widespread in the modern Russian population. Furtherexpansion of the sample will allow making a complete picture of medieval Tver. G.D. Stepanov: novel loci for circulating anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone levels in women R. M. G. Verdiesen 1, Y.

Identi cation of genetic variants underlying variation in AMH levels could elucidate these AMH-disease associations. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies including data from 7,049 premenopau- sal female participants of European ancestry, to identify SNPs associated with circulating AMH levels. Study-specic analyses were adjusted for age at blood collection and population strati cation, and summary statistics were meta-analysed using a standard error-weighted approach. Results: We identi ed four loci for circulating AMH. We conrmed the previously reported association with the MCM8 locus and identi ed three novel signals in or near AMH, TEX41 , and CDCA7 . The strongest signal was nonsynonymous missense variant located in exon 5 of theAMH gene (rs10417628, (SE)=-0.34 (0.05), p=1.2 x 10 11). LD score regression analyses indicated a strong positive genetic correlation among SNPs for AMH levels and for age at menopause (r g=0.82, FDR =0.003). Two- sample Mendelian Randomization analyses did not support a causal effect of circulating AMH on breast canceror PCOS. Conclusions: We identi ed three novel loci for AMH levels in premenopausal women. Whilst this study almostdoubled the sample size of the most recent GWAS, we may still lack power to determine causal effects of AMH on for example breast cancer.

P19.008.C Founder effect in the French-Canadian population of the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region in Quebec: screening strategies for rare diseases and local initiatives underdevelopment T. Cruz Marino , M. Desmeules, J. from 17 thcentury onward provided the genetic background of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean 's population. A founder effect has been well described in this Quebec region. A pilot program started in 2010 for carrier screening of ARSACS, tyr-osinemia type I, Leigh syndrome French-Canadian type, and hereditary sensory-motor neuropathy with/without agenesis of the callosum. programbecame province-wide through a web-based strategy thatAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 701reached previously underserved regions. Simultaneously, new founder conditions have been identi ed. Methods: We review the particularities and the results of the web-based test; we present a new group of founder conditions, as well as the strategies under development for their accurate diagnosis. Results: During the rst two years, more than 3000 individuals from 17 regions of Quebec province opted for taking the web-based carrier test, the majority of them werefemales, and preconceptional predominated over prenatal requests. A project for neonatal screening of vitamin D- dependent rickets is about to begin on a research basis as aninitial step. Other initiatives are being discussed for the screening or early diagnosis of mucolipidoses type II, type 1. Conclusions: The web-based carrier testing allows equitable access to all individuals coming from Saguenay- Lac-St-Jean and living in any region of Quebec province.This data highlights the importance of developing local strategies that suit the needs of founder populations.

P19.009.A Arsenic ef cient metabolism in Mexican Indigenous reinforces the arsenical hypothesis R. I. Montero-Delgado 1, M. L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez1, Guti\u00e9rrez, Chiapas, Mexico Introduction: Mexico is an arsenic-endemic country with more than two million individuals exposed, chronically, toelevated concentrations of this metalloid via drinking water. Arsenic-3-methyltransferase, encoded by AS3MT gene, is a key enzyme in the metabolism of inorganic arsenic,methylating it and eliminating in the urine. Dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) has been associated with more ef ciently arsenic metabolism a reduced sensitivity to this metalloid;monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) with elevated toxicity. Varying MMA and DMA proportions present inter- population and inter-ethnic variations. Native Americansgroups, whose ancestors arrived at the Americas ybp seem to metabolize arsenic more ef ciently thanEuropean-derived populations who have exhibited high toxicity risk. Thus, arsenic tolerance could be related to long-term exposition. The contemporary Native Americans, descendants of the ancient Mesoamerican cultures, along with a prominent admixed population between European and Indigenous (Mestizos), constitute a suitable scenario todelineate the genetic variation of AS3MT polymorphisms, which have been hardly studied. Methods and Results: Using 28 Ancestry Informative Markers and genotyping four AS3MT polymorphism (rs11191439, rs3740400, rs7085104 and rs10748835) we found that individuals with predominant Native Americanancestry exhibited higher frequencies of the Mestizos (0.31). to higher toxicity risk was alsoabsent in the tested Native Americans samples; the frequencies in Mestizos and European derived populations were 5% and 12%, respectively. Conclusions: Ourndings could reinforce the arsenical hypothesis about genetic adaptation related to long-term exposition.

Since the population of the Canary Islands has a high North African genetic ancestry amongSouthwestern Europeans and presents the highest asthma prevalence in Spain, here we examined asthma associations702 J. del Picchiain six loci showing an excess of African ancestry in this population. Methods: A two-stage study was conducted in 564 asthma cases and 923 controls from the Canary Islands genotyped on the Axiom Genome-Wide CEU1 array (Affymetrix). Imputation was performed using the HRCreference panel and logistic regressions were used to test association. Classic alleles from seven HLA genes were imputed and association testing was assessed with HIBAG. Results: Statistical signi cance was reached for colocalizes with an eQTL for several HLA and complement genes. This was associated with asthma, lung traits and peanut allergy. The most prominent classic HLA allele associations wereHLA-DQB1*02:01 and HLA-DQA1*05:01. These cluster in the DQ2.5 haplotype that is frequent in North Africa and associates with a high-risk of celiac disease and type-1diabetes. Conclusions: Targeted analyses of six regions enriched in African ancestry in the Canary Islanders revealed novelasthma risks linked to classic HLA alleles known to confer a high-risk for autoimmune diseases.

Some individuals have characteristics of both conditions ( \"asthma-COPD overlap syndrome \", ACOS), and evidence suggests they experience signi cantly worse outcomes than those with asthma or COPD alone. Although hundreds of genetic associations with asthma, COPD, and lung function have been identi ed, the genetics of ACOS have been little studied and no genetic variants have speci cally been associated. We tested 7,693,381 genetic variants for association with ACOS (de ned as self-reported asthma and spirometric airflow limitation) in 8068 cases and 40,360 healthy controls from UK Biobank (stage 1). Signals withP<5x1 0 6in this analysis, and P < 0.01 in two sensitivity analyses in UK Biobank using (i) controls with asthma but no COPD and (ii) controls with COPD but noasthma, were meta-analysed among the results from UK Biobank and 15 independent cohorts with an additional 4301 cases and 48609 controls (stage 2). All cases/controlswere of European ancestry. Thirty-one genetic variants met criteria for inclusion in stage 2.

Currently, the number and distribution of recessive alleles in the population is not known at genomic-scale. Existing estimates are extrapolations from speci c pheno- types and gene-sets. Methods: We used 4120 exome-sequences of genetically unrelated Dutch samples and an independent replicationcohort of 2330 exome-sequences of genetically unrelated Estonian samples, representing two distinct European populations. We analyzed 1758 genes classi ed as AR- only by OMIM and extracted all exonic and flanking intronic variants. We created a list of pathogenic/likely- pathogenic variants based on automated analysisand databases of classi ed variants. We simulated all possible matings within the Dutch and Estonian cohorts (8.5M/2.7M theoretical couples, respectively). Results: We estimate that there are 2.0 recessive heterozygous P/LPs per individual in the Dutch population giving rise to 1.3% ARCs. We replicate these results in theEstonian cohort where we nd 1.6 recessive heterozygous P/LPs per individual, resulting in 1.5% ARCs. The robustness of our approach was con rmed by the fact that >97% of variants had a carrier frequency of at most 0.5% (in both populations), and the remaining ~3% were well- known population-speci c founder mutations. Conclusions: In two distinct European populations, we nd similar estimates for carrier frequency per person and for the proportion of ARCs for a recessive disease. This istherst overall estimate of AR carriership in European populations and will inform schemes for introducing preconception carrier screening for AR diseases. H. Fridman: None. H.G. Yntema: None.

Perola1,2, S. 1THL Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Helsinki, Finland,2Research Program for Clinical and Molecular Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Background: Large genomics projects have pinpointed specic genomic variants that associate with disease end- points. Studying the biological pathways of these associations often require a systems biology approach. Since 1992, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has collected DNAsamples from all participants of its health examination sur- veys. Today, THL enables access to vast amounts of genomic and other omics data through its biobank. Materials & Methods: THL Biobank currently hosts omics data from 11 Finnish study cohorts. The collections include: GWAS chip data N>109,000, (>90,000 imputed N>7,000.NMR metabolomics is available for N>40,000. The omics data can be combined with a wide range of questionnaire, clinical examination and laboratory variables, and studyparticipants can be followed up (for up to 27 years) from national registers for disease endpoints and drug purchases. THL Biobank 's most diverse dataset, DILGOM (a subset of FINRISK 2007), includes data from all of the above listed data types. Besides data, cells are available for >10,000 and RNA for >3,000. Results & Conclusions: THL Biobank is accessible on FAIR-principles for researchers and companies worldwide. Since 2015, 130 biobank projects have been initiated,including interesting projects in pharmacogenomics, evolu- tionary genetics, return of genetic information to biobank participants and cardiovascular and cancer research. Geno-mic data requests are included in 94% of the biobank applications (122/130). In 2019, a marked increase was seen in applications on metabolomic data and recall studies. A. Joensuu: A.

The underlying biology creating these discrepancies is not well understood. We aimed to identify ethnic/racial differences in epide-miological, clinicopathological, and genomic characteristics of breast cancer in young women (BCYW) as compared to elderly women across different populations. Materials and Methods: We used data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume X reports, Gulf Centre for Cancer Registration, including clinical andsurvival data from 11,244 Saudi/Arab women, 107,938 African-American and 882,242 non-Hispanic White women (US NCI SEER database), and transcriptomic pro le of breast tumors in young and elderly women cohorts from four different ethnic/racial origins. Results: Our results indicated distinct epidemiological and biological features in BCYW as compared to the elderly patients across different populations. Notably higher immune related processes in young Arab and UK women,to a certain extent in African-American women. Moreover, we identi ed genes and upstream regulators that are distinct or common in early- vs late-onset BC among four differentpopulations. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the rst study to examine the molecular, epidemiological, genomic signa-tures, and survival of women with BC patients in Arab and Western populations in age-speci c cohorts. The population-speci c molecular alterations and distinct clin- icopathological characteristics may explain the racial and age-related discrepancies in disease outcome and may lead to more effective treatment strategies.Acknowledgement: This study is funded by the Research Grant (RAC#2110006 to DC).

Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico Respiratorias, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain Introduction: The Spanish DNA National Bank (NDNAB) was created to promote genomic research in the country.Recent efforts have characterized the genetic substructure of mainland populations and their recent genetic in fluences. Leveraging the NDNAB population controls, here we aimedto analyze the genetic structure of Spain with a particular focus on their relationships with Canary Islanders, a geo- graphically isolated population with a sizeable proportion Genotypes from 758,740 variants represented by donors from 19 autono-mous regions including the Canary Islands, were obtained with the Axiom Spain Biobank Array (Affymetrix). Population structure was assessed using a combination ofprincipal component analyses, complementary high- dimensional reduction techniques (UMAP), and model- based ancestry estimates. Results: Approximate population-aggregated clusters were identi ed using grandparental geographical origin, language and ancestry strata. Evident groups were observed706 J. del Picchiain major axes of differentiation according to autonomous regions, most obviously represented by Catalans, Basques and Galicians as has been described before. However, another clear axis of differentiation was due to the Canary Islanders.

Literature suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota composition and function precede the onset of CeD. Considering that microbiotacharacteristics are determined by host genetics, we spec- ulate that the genetic makeup of CeD patients could elicit disease manifestation through alterations in the intestinalmicrobiota. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the causal relation- ship of gut microbiota with the risk of developing CeD, weperformed a Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (2SMR) analysis. Exposure data was obtained from three raw datasets of a previous Genome Wide Association Study(GWAS) of gut microbiota composition and function, andoutcome data from summary statistics of the most relevant GWAS on CeD. Results: We have identi ed a number of putative causal associations between gut microbiota composition and function with SNPs associated with CeD. Regarding bacterial composition, most of the associated SNPs arerelated to Firmicutes phylum, whose relative abundance has been reported to be altered in CeD patients. In terms of functional units, we have linked SNPs located in intronicregions of known CeD-associated genes, such as LPP or PUS10 , to a variety of bacterial metabolic pathways. Conclusions: This study represents the rst 2SMR approach to elucidate the causal relationships between microbiome and CeD from GWASs. Next steps should focus on deciphering the underlying molecular mechanismsfrom a basic and clinical perspective. Funding: ISCIII 16/00258 to None. A. Cilleros-Portet: None. E. Moyua: None. A.

To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach for correcting subtle population strati ca- tion we t principal components (PCs) calculated from the coancestry matrix as covariates in a logistic regressionmodel GWAS and compared metrics of statistical in flation ( GCand LD-score regression intercept) to a model using single marker PCs as covariates. Additionally we exploredthe extent of structure captured by PBWT-paint using t- distributed stochastic neighbour embedding and identi ed genetic clusters using Louvain network clustering. Results: The coancestry matrix revealed both striking broadscale genetic structure between countries and subtle genetic structure within countries, making it an appealingoption for correcting overt and cryptic GWAS confounding. We observed that both the GCand LD-score regression intercept were signi cantly closer to 1 when using PCs of the haplotype sharing matrix, signifying lower in flation and confounding from population structure. Notably, the GWAS analysis corrected using haplotype sharing PCs ascovariates retained the power to detect all signi cant loci from the original meta analysis of the data, alongside an additional hit at the established ALS locus TBK1 , suggest- ing that it has improved power over traditional approaches.

Khatim1, de and INSERM UMR1141, Paris, France Introduction: The French Ministry of Health has imple- mented a vast epidemiological program on rare diseases (RD), in parallel of the establishment of reference and expertise centres for RD in France. A majority of thesecentres have adopted the CEMARA web-portal, set up by the national data repository for all RD, which allows the collation of data for patients seen within these centres. Since2007, a minimal data set (MDS) was collected prospectively for all these patients. Methods: After a 10-year period, we analyzed anon- ymously and retrospectively administrative, demographic, care organization and diagnoses data. Results: 228,243 individuals were enrolled from 2007 to 2017 through the AnDDI Rares network, including 167,361 affected individuals (median age 11 years, 54% children, 46% adults) with a balanced sex-ratio. Among the 2,872RD, 1,907 (66,5%) were recorded in less than 10 patients. 45.6% of patients had no diagnosis. Given the centres ' geographical coverage, patients have an average distance totravel of 25.1 km, suggesting an ef ciency of the health organization for RD. Focus can be done by disease groups such as chromosomal abnormalities (enabling an extensiveoverview) or by diseases; leading to operable large cohorts of patients with diverse data within the MDS (demographic, clinical, medical care) and more if lled out. Conclusions: The main objective of CEMARA is, in the eld of RD, to provide support for epidemiological, clinical or therapeutic studies, for which a collective and coopera-tive effort between centres is necessary, and to provide qualitative/quantitative indications for the establishment of national health policies.

Zarubin1,Z . Musta A. V. V. Stepanov1 1Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation,2Institute of and Genetics SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation Preeclampsia (PE) is a complication pregnancy char- acterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria ofgestation, with serious consequences for mother and infant. However, the evolutionary machineries of PE are still lar- gely unknown. Here, we used a method that combinesphylostratigraphy information with gene co-expression networks to extensively study the evolutionary composi- tions of PE. The present co-expression network constructionyielded 3987 nodes based on 129 PE and normal pregnancy expression samples obtained from the GEO database. A total of 31 modules were identi ed as PE related clusters and 34 modules were identi ed in control group. Using WGCNA, we found 6 clusters containing 86 genes asso- ciated only with PE. We using cytoHubba (MCC, rank 5) and STRING. As part of evolutionary analysis, we calcu-lated the phylostratigraphic age index (PAI) and the diver- gence index (DI) using Orthoscape. We note that 70,9% genes in network have PAI 3, but interesting that most of hub genes (GYPA, GYPB, IFI44, IFI44L, CXCL9, CXCL10) have PAI 5 evolutionary processes were genes GYPA, GYPB, IFI44,IFI44L (DI 3,918-0,834), only YY1 and RAD21 have PAI 1(Eukaryota) and low DI (0,054-0,186).These results demonstrate that most hub genes for this network divergedfrom their ancestors. The integrated analysis of the topology of PE modules and the phylogenetic data revealed an evo- lutionary pattern of PE in and of medical to revolutio- nise human health by improving medical treatment through a better understanding of the genetic epidemiology ofhuman diseases. Despite great successes of the last decade 's genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the results have to a limited extent been translated to genomic medicine. Wepropose, that one route to get closer to improved medical treatment is by understanding the genetics of medication- use. We hypothesise that, irrespectively of medical condi-tion, medication-use per se has a unique genetic heritable architecture. Methods: Medication-use from 335.744 individuals from the UK Biobank was obtained, and we conducted a GWAS on 9 million imputed genetic variants. We estimated the heritability of medication-use and partitioned the geneticvariance across different categories. Using ve-fold cross validation we performed within sample prediction of medication-use. Results: We identi ed 57 independent loci associated with variation in medication-use and estimated that 14% of the total variation was attributable to common geneticvariants. The largest fraction of genetic variance was captured by variants with low to medium minor allele frequency. In particular coding and conserved regions, aswell as transcription start sites, displayed signi cantly enrichment of heritability. The mean prediction accuracy was 0.14. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that medication- use per se is a complex trait irrespectively of medical condition. Thus, if the goal is to improve medical treatmentit might be insuf cient to solely rely on analyses of complex diseases as medication-use per se has its own genetic architecture.

ABAR , dom Background: Carnitine, a water-soluble quaternary amine, is essential for the normal functioning of all tissues and has an important role in energy metabolism by transferring long-chain fatty acids (acyl groups) to the mitochondrialmatrix for oxidation and depleting the acyl groups out of the mitochondria. Accumulating evidence from animal and human studies indicates that carnitine and its acyl-derivatives may have potential bene ciary cation of vascular cognitive impairment in dementia patients. Objective: The overarching aim of the study is to investigate whether carnitine levels have causal effects on risk of complex disorders including coronary artery disease(CAD), type2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer 's disease (AD) by applying Two-sample Mendelian Randomisation (MR) analysis. Methods: A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of the Airwave cohort participants and publicly available results from a meta-analysis of theKORA and TwinsUK studies was used to identify instruments for carnitine. Summary statistics data for CAD, T2D and AD were obtained from publicly availableGWAS meta-analyses conducted by the CARDIoGRAM- plusC4D, DIAGRAM and IGAP consortiums. MR analyses were performed using the inverse-variance-weighted(IVW), weighted-median, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) test and MR-Egger regression. Results: There was evidence of a signi cant causal inverse association between carnitine and coronary artery disease. No further evidence for a causal effect observed between carnitine and other outcomes including T2D and AD. Conclusions: The study ndings suggest that carnitine has a protective effect on the risk of coronary artery disease. L. Abar: None. V. Zuber: None. A. Dehghan: None. P19.030.A The results of the program of DNA diagnostics in patients with cystic brosis in the RF in Kutsev, A. Voronkova, V. Sherman, R. Budzinsky Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: According to the national cystic brosis (CF) registry 2017, a genetic study was performed in 92.4% ( n=2816) of patients with CF in RF, the frequency of identi ed pathogenic variant (PV) was 88.3% (80.2% had 2 PV, in 16.1% - none). A total of 7.6% ( n=231) CF patients need genetic diagnostics. Materials and Methods: within realization the program of DNA diagnostics in patients with CF in 2018-2019, 350patients (265 patients from the national registry and 85 patients with CF unspeci ed) were examined for frequent PV in CFTR . DNA was isolated from leukocytes using standard procedures, sequencing was performed in 52 patients, and MLPA was performed 20 patients. Results: We were able to increase the number of diagnosed patients, and the percent of identi ed PV in 18 distant RF regions. As a result of the work carried out, 2 PV were identi ed in 168 patients, one in 34, none in 84 (the diagnosis is not con rmed). 64 blood samples are still being sequenced. Conclusion: Due to the improvements in CF diagnostics, an increased number of regions is added to the national registry. A larger number of newly diagnosed patients still need DNA diagnostics. The program will continue in 2020-2021. The work was carried out with the support of the \"Ostrova \"charitable Foundation. E. Zhekaite: None. E. Kondratyeva: None. N. Petrova: None. R.

Here, we investigated whether there is a family-speci c contribution to the number of DNMs in off- spring. We analyzed DNMs from four large whole genomesequencing cohorts of diverse ancestry. First, we compared the difference in the number of DNMs in 111 dizygotic twin pairs to those from 578 pairs of parental age-matched unre-lated children, but we did not observe a signi cant family- specic contribution. Subsequently we compared differences in DNMs from siblings to those of randomly matched indi-viduals with correction for parental age, and again observed no signi cant differences. Finally, we used a random effects model to directly estimate the potential impact of family-specic effects on variation in DNM number using a cohort of 1590 families with two offspring and a second cohort of 45 families with an average of 9.3 offspring. We estimated afamilial variance component of only 5.2%. Additionally, we found almost no difference between the observed number of DNMs in these offspring and those expected based on astochastic Poisson model. We therefore conclude that family- specic contribution to DNM number in offspring is small and that stochasticity explains a large proportion of theobserved variation. J.E. Hampstead: J.M.

Hurles1 1Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, GermanyThe human germline mutation rate is known to vary between individuals. Most of the variation in the population is explained by parental age, but little is known about rare outliers with extreme mutation rates. We have tackled this problem using both phenotype and genotype driven approaches. For our phenotype driven approach, we identi ed germ- line hypermutators and sought genetic causes for this trait. We identi edve children with an excessive number of de novo mutations (DNMs) across ~20,000 individuals from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study and Genomics England Limited dataset. They all have >3.5times DNMs as expected ranging from 257-426 DNMs per individual. In four children, the excess DNMs all phased paternally implicating the father as a germline hypermu-tator. We identi ed a potentially causal variant in two of the fathers: a rare homozygous missense mutation in the gene MPG and a rare homozygous nonsense mutation in XPC.For the remaining child, the mutations appear to have occurred post-zygotically indicating this is unlikely attribu- table to a parental hypermutator. The genotype-drivenapproach focussed on whether variants in DNA repair genes impact germline mutation rates. First, we interrogated variants in an established cancer mutator gene, MBD4,and found they did not have the same effect in the germline. Second, we performed analyses of the impact of rare damaging variants in DNA repair genes on individualgermline mutation rate. Our analyses provide new insights into the role of genetic variation on the human germline mutation rate and uncoverpossible genetic causes of germline hypermutation. J. Kaplanis: None. P.

Ownership Interest (stock, stock options, patent or other intellectual property); in relation to eosinophil counts J. Uppsala, SwedenDuring the last decade, thousands of associations between common variants and complex traits and diseases have beenidenti ed. With rapid advancement in high-throughput sequencing technology, progress in sequencing rare and low-frequency variants is constantly being made. For rarevariants, region-based analyses have been suggested to be712 J. del Picchiamore powerful as compared to standard variant association testing. In this study, we used the sequence kernel asso- ciation test (SKAT) to test for association with eosinophil counts, performed in the initial release of the UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing dataset ( N=49,960). We tested forve different scenarios, with various single nucleotide variant (SNV)-weighting functions. The primary SKAT analyses resulted in 51 signi cant transcripts throughout the ve scenarios, all colocalizing with at least one GWAS signal. When adjusting for all signi cant, primary and conditional, top GWAS hits, ve transcripts mapping to three regions ( CLC, IL-33 and ST20-MTHFS ) remained signicant in the SKAT tests. The association with CLC seems to be driven by two common variants, not previously associated with eosinophil counts. In contrast, variants witha minor allele frequency below 0.5% seem to drive the association with IL-33 . For most of the SKAT signals, a single-marker GWAS seems to capture the majority ofvariation in eosinophil count. However, it is plausible that a larger sample size is needed to fully resolve the effect of rare variants.

S.A., Bogot\u00e1, Colombia Introduction: Whole and clinical exome sequencing (WES, CES) has been used increasingly in clinical diag- nostics for a variety of indications to identify the underlyinggenetic cause of disease. As a clinical diagnostic laboratory, we sought to review our experience analyzing 124 WES and CES cases over the past 4 years to better understand theclinical contexts in which WES/CES can provide a plau- sible explanation for the presenting symptoms. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 124 consecutive cases referred to our laboratory for WES/CES from 2016 to 2019 and performed clinical categorization. Results: We analyzed 124 cases, with 97 (78.2%) submitted as proband only, 2 (1.6%) with one additional family member, and 25 (20.2%) with two additional family members. A de nitive result (Pathogenic and Likely pathogenic) was provided in 41.1%, a possible/probable (VOUS) result was provided in 38.7%, a candidate generesult as the only nding was provided in 3.2%, and a negative result was provided in 16.9%. Secondary ndings were offered to all participants, of whom 120 opted out (96.7%), but were found in only 2 cases (1.7%). Conclusions: Positive results impacted patient care, regardless of whether the established diagnosis wastreatable. Cases that remained unsolved (VOUS) should be carefully considered, and variant reclassi cation must be followed up. Reanalysis of data generated by WES and CESmay eventually yield a diagnosis for patients with negative or uncertain results. Even when the results were non- informative, WES/CES allowed the medical team tostreamline diagnostic evaluations and/or focus on managing known issues. A.J. None.

Results: We identi ed three novel Falling risk heritability was modest (2.5%). Falls had positive genetic correlation with fracture risk genetic correlation with muscle strength (rg =-0.24, se =0.04), intelligence (rg well-being (rg =0.29, se=0.05). Brain and in particular cerebellum tissue showed the highest gene expression enrichment (FDR<5%) for fall-associated variants. MR analyses found a causal effect of high BMI and low relative handgrip on increased falling risk. Conclusions: Falling risk constitutes a heritable, hetero- geneous and polygenic trait genetically correlated with fracture grip strength.

Kirov4, Martin1, M. E. Hurles1 1Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom, 2Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany,3Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden, 4School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom Sequencing of human populations has revealed highly variable patterns of natural selection acting on human genes, with a minority of genes appearing to be under strong selection against heterozygous variants that abolishthe function of the encoded protein. Although these selec- tively constrained genes are strongly enriched for dominant single gene disorders, for most of these genes the nature ofthe selective constraint is unknown. We called large dele- tions from SNP genotyping on 50K UK Biobank participants. We deter- mined the cumulative burden of likely loss-of-function variants in each UK Biobank participant, weighted according to the degree of selective constraint of the impacted gene(s), which we term their S hetburden. We found that increasing S hetburden results in substantially reduced male reproductive success, driven by an increased risk of childlessness ( p=4x1015). This reduction in reproductive success is much weaker in females ( p= 0.0026). S hetburden is also associated with reduced fluid intelligence, educational attainment and household income,but without strong sex-bias. We present evidence that this reduced male reproductive success is most likely mediated by cognitive and behavioural traits, which, due to femalepreferences for mating partners likely to invest resources in their offspring, renders male carriers of such variants less able to nd mating partners. Our ndings support a sub- stantial role for sexual selection due to mate choice pre- ferences shaping the recent evolution of human genes. E.J. H.C. Martin: None. M.E. Hurles: E.

P19.042.A Modi cation of Heritability for Educational Attainment and Fluid Intelligence by Socioeconomic Deprivation in the UK Biobank M. Rask-Andersen measured either in years of educa- tion or whether an individual has attended college or uni- versity, constitutes a complex genetic trait that correlates with cognitive traits, such as intelligence. It is stronglylinked to quality-of-life measurements such as subjective well-being, paid employment, overall health, mortality and obesity. Socioeconomic factors have been suggested toinfluence the effect of education- and intelligence- associated genetic variants. However, results from pre- vious studies on the interaction between socioeconomicstatus and education or intelligence have been inconsistent. We therefore assessed the effect of socioeconomic depri- vation on education- and intelligence-associated for fluid intelli- gence, educational attainment and years of education, in subsets of the UK Biobank with different degrees of socialdeprivation using LD score regression (LDSC). We also generated polygenic scores with LDpred and tested for714 J. del Picchiainteractions with social deprivation. The SNP heritability for all phenotypes were found to increase with socio- economic deprivation. Polygenic scores for all phenotypes were also found to interact with socioeconomic deprivation, where the effects of polygenic scores increase with increasing deprivation. These results imply that geneticshave a larger in fluence on educational and cognitive out- comes in more socioeconomically deprived UK citizens, which has serious implications for equality of opportunity.

Alvarez3, Serra4, (CRG-CNAG), Parc Cient\u00ed c de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain Introduction: Until now, most of the populations con- sidered in population genetics studies are of urban origin,representing large geographical or even continental regions. The study of genetic variation of rural populations such as the Pyrenean one, can be of great interest. In addition, theexistence of natural barriers and the well characterized demographic history, make the genetic study of this popu- lation as an important piece of the puzzle on genetic var-iation in Europe. Materials and Methods: We selected for this study a sample of 435 subjects with their eight grandparents born inthe Catalan Pyrenean counties. DNA was extracted from blood. Genotyping data was obtained from each subject by using the Axiom PMDA genotyping array at the CEGENfacilities. Genotypes were merged with 1000 Genome Phase III data resulting in a nal data set of 2939 individuals and 552.000 common SNPs. Results: A PCA analysis shows the distinctive European genetic constitution of the Pyrenean population, ascompared to other continents. Within Europe, the Pyrenean population could be clearly distinguished from other European populations. Within Pyrenean a west-east gradi- ent in genetic variability was noticed. STRUCTURE analysis reveals a west-east gradient on Norden European ancestry as well as an inverse gradient on South Europeanancestry. Conclusions: The genetic diversity of the populations of the Catalan Pyrenees is macro-scale within the Europeangenetic diversity, following the same macro-spatial patterns that are observed within Europe and, in particular, with the populations of the South of Europe.

Results: Incidence of hepatic carcinomas was higher in male p.C282Y homozygotes compared to those without mutations (HR: 14.1, 95% CI: 7.6-26.1). However, no associations p.C282Y heterozygotes or p.C282Y/p.H63D com- pound men would die, compared (95% CI:14.7-15.5) in those without mutations.

However, some obese individuals, the metabolically healthy obese (MHO), do not suffer from cardiometabolic comorbidities. Recent evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to thisparadoxical phenotype. We aim to 1) ascertain the genetic variants that predispose MHO, 2) identify enriched tissues and gene sets of these variants, 3) examine regulatory rolesof neighbouring eQTL and DNase1 hypersensitive sites of these variants, and 4) prioritize causal genes. Materials & Methods: We 1) used publicly available GWAS statistics and identi ed loci associated with pairwise combinations of three adiposity and eight cardiometabolic traits, 2) conducted DEPICT tissue and gene set enrichmentanalyses on identi ed loci, 3) examined nearby enhancer dynamics in DNase1 hypersensitive sites during in vitro adipogenesis, and 4) performed ingenuity pathway analysisto prioritize causal genes. Results: We 1) identi ed 62 independent loci reaching genome-wide signi cance, 2) highlighted adipose tissue and liver as the most signi cantly enriched tissues, and the protein-protein interaction partners of OAT gene as the most signicantly enriched pathway, involved in glutamate- related energy metabolism, 3) con rmed the 62 loci more likely overlap with adipose tissue eQTLs and DNase1 hypersensitive sites that increase accessibility duringadipogenesis, 4) prioritized 61 putative causal genes may identify novel biomarkers and future drug targets. Conclusions: Combining GWAS meta-analysis with follow-up studies, our ndings provide unequivocal insights into the biological pathways that underlie MHO.

WGS data of 947 samples from three Italian isolated cohortshave been analysed to select biallelic \"autosomal recessive were retained. We identi ed two groups of HKO: a) individuals showing clinical features of Mendelian recessive disorders but without a previous genetic diagnosis and b) subjects who do not show any clinical characteristic signs/symp-toms. In group a) interesting examples involve three genes and three individuals respectively: Patient-1 , KO for GPR68 gene and showing amelogenesis imperfecta clinical features, Patient-2 KO for F12 gene and presenting increased APTT values with normal wound healing, Patient-3 KO for C7gene and displaying an increased susceptibility to systemic infections. In group b) Patient-4 , KO for FANCL gene, despite a positive chromosome fra- gility assay, does not display Fanconi-Anemia hematolo-gical features but only a clinical history of head/neck carcinoma and a short stature. We are currently expanding our collection of KO individuals detecting subjects who arecompound heterozygous carriers of LoF mutations in genes involved in autosomal recessive disorders and, so far, 54 individuals have been detected. Functional studies to eval-uate the potential phenotypic consequences of this variants will be performed. In conclusion, thanks to the study of HKO we lay the foundation for preventive strategies (as inthe case of group a) but also for searching new protective variants/genes and therapeutic approaches for the study of Mendelian disorders.

The current presentation asseses the nal results of a 3 part study comprising the rst and the largest GWAS on hypertension in Romanians. Material and Methods: The total cohort includes a number of 5690 individuals, of which 2190 with hyperten- sion and 3500 heathy controls. Genetic testing performed at DeCode Genetics, Reykjavik, Iceland. Amultiple GWAS assay has been performed for the identi cation of variants associated with hypertension, HTA risk factors (smoking, alcohol, coffee consumption)and HTA comorbidities (obesity, diabetes mellitus). Results: Tissue-speci c protein expression, gene function and gene-gene interactions have been analyzed for assessinga possible biological explanation for the association between the identi ed variants and HTA. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were assessed for variants inthe reported locations for a better understanding of their involvement in HTA. The results revealed over 5000 genetic variants correlated with HTA, some well documen-ted and in genes known to be involved in HTA (clusters on chromosomes 1p,1q,3q,4p,5q,7q,12p,15q,17q,20q,a.o. or CRNKL1,C19Orf12,CCDC51,C20Orf26,ZNF420,ZNF571, a.o. intragenic variants). Approx. with diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity. Variants correlated with both HTA and DMwere identi ed (TBX20, ANK2, a.o. genes). Two other clusters on chromosomes 19q12 and 20p11.21 revealed associations with both HTA and obesity. Conclusions: The results revealed several gene clusters correlated with HTA. The validity of these results for the Romanian population need to be con rmed by replication studies. The research is part of EU ProMark, ROMCAN and AppGenEdu projects.R. Ursu: None. P. None. G.

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region is one of themost complex regions in the genome and in fluences the risk of in flammatory and respiratory conditions. The extreme genetic diversity of the HLA challenges the interpretation ofassociation studies, therefore speci c imputation strategies exist to capture HLA alleles and amino acid changes. The HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele has been previously associated with brotic idiopathic interstitial combined bespoke SNP imputation (using the Haplotype Reference Consor-tium panel). We tested the association of 39,570 SNPs, HLA alleles and amino acid changes across the HLA region with IPF susceptibility in 1,905 IPF cases and 13,876controls controls], Chicago [500 cases, 510 controls] and UUS [793 cases and 10,000 controls]). Sex and 10 principalcomponents were included as covariates. The results were meta-analysed using a xed-effects weighted (P<2.8\u00d7106) in this meta-analysis. rs3132684 was consistently signi - cant (P < 0.05) across all three datasets and is possibly an eQTL for several classical and non-classical HLA genes. The HLA-DQB1*06:02 was not associated with IPF (P=0.57). We present the largest study of HLA variation in IPF susceptibility to date, using a combination of SNPimputation and HLA imputation. One variant was consis- tently associated with IPF susceptibility in our data, further analysis is required to determine the functional effect. M.L. Paynton: None. R.J. Allen: None. J. Oldham: B.

A genetic lia-bility, measured through Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), for infections and mental health disorders could also drive this association. Here, we studied the genetic liability on theassociation between several different types of infections that led to hospital visits, with the risk of being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To study this association,we used the Danish-based iPSYCH case-control study population, as well as a cohort of randomly sampled indi- viduals from the Danish population. We observe that havingcertain types of infection, but not all types, can increase the lifetime risk of autism for those with a genetic liability. This risk for ASD diagnosis following a severe infection was thehighest for those with the highest PRS for ASD J. Shorter: None. M. Krebs: None. A. Ingason: None. M. Benros: None. W. Thompson: None.

Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala, Sweden Protein biomarkers are indicators, often measured in blood, that are used to estimate severity or presence of disease. A number of in flammatory protein biomarkers have been identi ed to be associated with development of in flamma- tory diseases or disease outcomes. These proteins might therefore serve as potential drug targets, or shed light into the pathogenesis of the diseases. However, if the biomarkeritself increase the risk (is causal) of getting the disease is usually not known. Here we applied a two sample Men- delian randomization (MR) approach, using data from twocohorts (NSPHS and UK Biobank), to investigate the causal effect of 20 in flammatory protein biomarkers, known or suggested, on 18 in flammatory TNFB, TWEAK, VEGF-A), having a tentative causal effect on eight different in flammatory diseases (FDR 0.05). IL- 12B showed a causal effect on psoriatic arthritis, IL-15RA on eczema, TNFB on Type arthritisand in flammatory polyarthropathies. We also identi ed a causal effect of TWEAK on asthma and a causal effect of VEGF-A on both in flammatory bowel disease and its sub phenotype ulcerative colitis. The causal effects on disease progress investigated here, may be used to further evaluate the potential of these proteins as drug targets This project is funded by SciLifeLab, the Swedish Research Council (VR), the \u00c5ke Wiberg, M Borgstr\u00f6m, A, M Rudbergs, and the Swedish Heart and Lung foundation .

J. van Rooij, M. F. van Dooren, A. G. Uitterlinden, R. M. W. Hofstra, S. Lamballais, H. H. H. Adams Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Genome-wide association studies have identi ed genetic variants that, together in polygenic risk scores (PRS), confer substantial risk for many complex traits. While clinical implementation of PRS is underway, itremains unclear how such scores propagate in pedigrees. Here, we determine the inheritance patterns of PRS to aid clinical counselling of genetic liability for complex traits. Methods: We simulated polygenic risk for six complex diseases in 10,000 multigenerational families, modelling both random and consanguineous mating. We determinedinheritance patterns for up to ten generations. Furthermore, we examined biparental inheritance patterns. Results: Correlations of polygenic risk ranged from 47.1% to 49.0% for between rst-degree relatives and from 23.1% to 24.3% for second-degree relatives ( Table 1 ). When both parents 'PRS is known, the ranges become narrower for their offspring, especially for the extremes (Table 2 ). In high-risk (>95%) individuals, median polygenic risk for rst- and second-degree respectively 85.2% and 69.7%, and approximated popula- tion average in the fth generation. Results were similar across traits, and for random and consanguineous mating. Discussion: Extreme polygenic risk propagates for multiple generations and is particularly informative in biparental inheritance. Future steps include validation inreal multigenerational datasets and extension to larger number of genetic variants. Table 1.

P19.059.C Comparative analysis of WGS data from Bulgarian centenarians and ndings from meta-GWA studies reveals genetic loci associated with longevity T. 1,2, 1Department Medical Medical University of Soa, So a, Bulgaria,2Genomic Laboratory, Malinov Clinic, So a, \"St. Ohridski \",S oa, BulgariaHuman lifespan is a complex, trait resulting from the interplay of many genetic variants with small effect and a wide range of environmental factors. It is estimated that the heritability of longevity in humans could be up to 25%. To identify potential factors that contribute tothis phenotype we performed whole-genome sequencing on DNA samples from 16 centenarians from the Bulgarian population. Their genotypes were extracted at more than 20genetic loci associated with high parental lifespan - an appropriate measure for heritable longevity, from two large GWAS meta-analyses (AncestryDNA and LifeGen) utilis-ing the UK Biobank and their own cohorts. We established that 5 genetic variants were signi cantly enriched within our centenarian cohort compared to individuals of non-Finnish European ancestry in the gnomAD population database. Only one of them was exonic - the well- recognised rs429358-T in the APOE gene, , were non-coding suggesting that mechanisms regulating gene expression might play a role in longevity. Interestingly, all these genes are involved in different car- diometabolic conditions. Combinations of these variants, aswell as with other factors, could therefore be protective against cardiovascular risk factors - a common cause of death in many older people, or could potentially slow downthe process of biological ageing. A larger cohort of precious samples from centenarians could validate these ndings and provide one more piece of the complex puzzle of humanlongevity.

As such variants in disease-related genes are under strong negative naturalselection, their frequency across major ancestral groups is expected to be highly similar. In this study, we tested this assumption by systematically assessing the presence ofhighly prevalent population-speci c PTVs in human genes using gnomAD data. We discovered unusually high inci- dence of population-speci c pLoF variants in all major ancestral groups, with a total of 1,972 genes harboring such population-speci c sites. Such prevalence of PTVs does not conform to a deterministic statistical model developed byCassa et al. in 2017, indicating either systematic differences in disease penetrance in different human populations or the failure of current annotation criteria to accurately predict theloss-of-function potential of PTVs. We demonstrate that high-frequency population-speci c PTVs tend to reside in exons that have low conservation scores and belong totranscripts with low expression levels, suggesting that these variants should not be treated as genuine LoF alleles. As such, additional data resources should be used duringinterpretation of genotypes in both population genetics and clinical genetics studies. Y.A. Barbitoff: None.

How- ever, the association between APN and diabetic retinopathy(DR) has been inconsistent from observational studies. To clarify the causal relationship, we used a Mendelianrandomization (MR) analysis to test the hypothesis that elevated circulating APN levels causally results in DR. Materials and Methods: A GWAS database-catalog of 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reaching signicance in East-Asians was utilized in 1251 diabetic patients in Taiwan. APN-SNPs that were geneticallyindependent, and without pleiotropic effect were selected as instrumental variables (IV). Including 3 different genetic risk scores (GRS): GRS Allcombined all 47 SNPs, GRS APN combined 5 SNPs signi cantly associated with APN level, and GRS Limited comprised 16 GRS All-SNPs with a threshold (P < 5 \u00d7 108for GWAS). Results: The MR-inverse-variance weighted method analysis showed that for each 1-SD increase in genetically induced increase in plasma APN, the OR of having DR -0.06 to 1.20, P=0.078) for GRS Limited . Sensitivity analysis, including MR-egger regression and the weighted- median approach, did not provide evidence of the pleiotropic effect of IVs. Conclusions: Limited evidence for the causal role of APN in DR risk among diabetic patients was shown based on MR analysis in the present study.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study with 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms for sleep duration using individual-participant data from UK biobank (208171women), Avon longitudinal study of parents and children722 J. del Picchia(7635 women) and born in Bradford (2977 women) to investigate effects of sleep duration on obstetric outcomes. Results: Using inverse variance weighted method, there was little evidence to support an effect of sleep duration on the risk of pregnancy loss (odds ratio [OR] per additional hour/day 1.02, 95% 0.52-1.29) Sensitivity analyses using MR-Egger, weighted median and weighted mode methods provided similarestimates. Conclusions: We did not nd consistent evidence supporting linear effects of sleep duration on obstetricoutcomes. However, even with large sample sizes some estimates are imprecise, and some point estimates suggest a potentially important clinical effect (e.g. 45% increasedodds of hypertensive disorders. In two-sample MR we cannot explore the possibility of non-linear effects. All authors work in a Unit supported by UK Medical ResearchCouncil (MC_UU_00011/3, MC_UU_00011/6). Q. Yang: None. K.

Duijn1,2 1Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Nether- lands,2University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom, 3Duke University, Durham, NC, United States Introduction: There is an important interplay between the intestinal microbiome and brain, commonly known as the gut-brain-axis. Several studies addressed the role of the microbiome in neurologic diseases. Here, we studied therole of stool microbiota in cognitive function, neurovascular aspects, and neurodegenerative aspects in the general population. Methods: In the population-based Rotterdam Study, we studied the association between stool microbial taxa andcognitive function, and neurovascular and neurodegenera- tive traits, measured on brain magnetic resonance imaging, in ~1,200 participants. Stool microbiota were pro led using 16s rRNA gene sequencing. We used linear regression analysis, accounted for multiple testing, and adjusted for major confounders, i.e., age, sex, technical covariates,medication use, alcohol, smoking, body mass index, and hypertension. Results: The genus Clostridium sensu stricto 1 showed a higher abundance in participants with better cognitive function (beta( )(standard error(SE)) 0.023(0.01), p= 3.22 \u00d7 10 p=1.83 p= 1.81 \u00d7 102). The family Clostridiaceae 1 also showed a higher abundance in these traits, with the same direction of effect and very similar effect estimates. The classClostridia , order Clostridiales , family Christensenellaceae , and genus R7 group showed a higher abundance in better cognition. Of note is that the agreementof our ndings with those of studies of Alzheimer 's disease is high. Conclusions: Clostridium shows a higher abundance in participants with better cognitive function, less neurovas- cular aspects, and less neurodegenerative aspects. We nd that different microbiota are associated to neurovascular andneurodegenerative pathology. H. Karamuji -omi:None. S. Ahmad: B. Bonnechere: R. Kad- durah-Daouk: None. A.G. Uitterlinden: None. R.

They left evidence in the rich cultural and historical heritage. By conducting molecular anthro-pological studies on Thracians mtDNA samples we aim to reveal their genetic characteristics and contribution to the gene pool of present day populations. Materials and methods: We have reconstructed and analyzed complete mitochondrial genomes from 25 Bronze Age individuals sampled in three different Bulgariannecropolises. The molecular phylogenetic analyses were performed following strict guidelines and standards. The Thracian mitogenomes were compared with differentmodern and ancient populations for understanding possible genetic relationships. Results: The obtained mtDNA sequences were assigned to 21 different haplogroups, representative of the mitochon- drial variability of Western Eurasia. The presented hap- logroups in our samples H, K, J and T arose in frequency indifferent European populations during the Neolithic. Sub- lineages of the haplogroup U mark the genetic pool of European pre-LGM hunter-gatherers. The results supportthe hypothesis of Thracians origin from the local people with a low percentage of gene flow from the Steppe. Conclusions: The Thracian maternal gene pool is mostly represented by Western Eurasian haplogroups. After comparing between the complete mitochondrial sequences of Thracians and Eurasian (ancient and contemporary)populations we observed that Thracians genetic pro les reflect their nexus geographical position between east and west. This study has an important implication for under-standing the origins of the peopling in this part of Europe and for enlarging the knowledge on the ancient Bronze Age civilizations. D.V.

Zinchenko2 1Rostov Medical State University, Rostov-on-Don, Russian Federation,2Medical Genetic Research Center named after Academician N.P. Bochkov, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Phacomatoses, also known as Neurocuta- neous syndromes (NCS), include a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormalities of both the inte- gument and central nervous system. Disorders classi ed as NCS include neuro bromatosis Ito (HOI), and incontinentia pigmenti (IP). Most disorders are inherited as autosomal dominant conditions with vari-able penetrance or can be caused by somatic mosaic mutation (SWS). Materials and Methods: The purpose of the present research was studying of prevalence of phakomatosis in Rostov region (12 districts). The total number of investi- gated population was 497460 persons. The research wasconducted under the original protocol providing for724 J. del Picchiadetection of more than 2500 various hereditary diseases (OMIM) and syndromes including all phacomatoses. Results: phacomatoses were NF1, TS, VHL, SWS accounted for 55, 15, 1, 7 cases correspondingly. The overall prevalence of phacomatoses in Rostov region was 1:71066. some patients additional molecular testing was available. Con- clusion. We estimated the incidence of phacomatoses in theRostov region that could allow to plan genetic support. Phacomatoses should be considered by doctors of different specialties. A.V. None.

Jackson1 1MRC - Human genetics unit, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 2Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Many of the biology of human pigmentation traits is shared between them, but there are some speci c genes and path- ways for each trait, and the similiarities and differences between them still need still to be understood. Recently wepublished a GWAS for hair colour variation in Europeans showing 8 genes related to red hair and more than 100 genes associated to blonde to black hair colour. AnotherGWAS found 20 loci related to UV sensitivity, and the largest study of skin colour variation in Europeans found 9 genes. In this study, we performed a GWAS of 452,264UKBiobank European individuals for hair colour, skin colour, and ease of tanning, using DISSECT, calculated the genetic correlations and studied the commonalities anddifferences. We identi ed 655 independent SNPs related to red hair in 128 genes, many of them within 3 MB of MC1R, but we nd new associations in regions related to pigmen- tation such MITF, a transcription factor controlling the pigmentation, and MFSD12, a gene related to darker skin in African populations. Using Whole exome sequencing for50,000 UKBiobank individuals, we identi ed 44 MC1R protein coding variants in red hair individuals, of whom 96.4% had 2 MC1R variants. We found 519 genes related tohair colour, 338 to skin colour and 293 to ease of tanning, of which 161 were common, with enriched function for mel- anin synthesis (pval~10-7) and lipid-bidning proteins(pval~10-9).

Irish genetic struc- ture inferred by rarer variants is less well understood. Apopulation 's demographic history impacts the whole variant frequency spectrum, including rare variants. These variants are usually younger than common variation, and often havea functional impact. Understanding the distribution of rare variants in Ireland will therefore elucidate genetic history and disease risk in Ireland. In this context, we generated 30x short-read whole- genome-sequencing and microarray genotype data on 880 Irish individuals, 280 of whom had genealogies mapped tospecic regions of Ireland. We ltered variants by standard quality control thresholds and generated 'genotype counts ' matrices which recorded the frequencies of each variant ineach Irish region. In parallel we estimated the functional impact of each variant, and generated haplotype data from the microarray data on these individuals. We investigated the impact of the demographic history of Ireland on the full spectrum of Irish genetic variation using this data. We report the different site frequency spectra forthe four Irish provinces alongside analysis of haplotype data that estimates Irish population size for the last 40 generations, detecting evidence of a modest population sizecompared to England. Using rare variation to detect population structure, we calculated F STdistances and proportion of f2variants between Irish regions, revealing the structure of rare variant sharing in Ireland. Our results have implications for the research of rare disease variants within Ireland and populations of Irish ancestry and informon Irish history. E.H. Gilbert: None. A. Corvin: None. A.

Here we generated genome-wide high-density SNP geno- type data in 425 individuals from six geographical regionsin Lithuania and combined our dataset with available ancient and modern data to explore genetic population structure, ancestry components and signatures of naturalpositive selection in the Lithuanian population. Our results show that Lithuanians are a homogenous population, genetically differentiated from neighbouring populationsbut within the general expected European context. More- over, we not only con rm that Lithuanians preserve one of the highest proportions of western, Scandinavian and east-ern hunter-gather ancestry components found in European populations but also that of an steppe Early to Middle Bronze Age pastoralists, which together con gure the genetic distinctiveness of the Lithuanian population. Finally, among the top signatures of positive selection detected in Lithuanians, we identi ed several candidate genes andIL22).

Santos2,3, O. Gokcumen3, F. Al-Mulla1, T. A. University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil,3State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, United States Introduction: Following the out-of-Africa diaspora, the Arabian Peninsula has experienced several waves of human migrations despite the prevailing extreme and varyingenvironmental conditions. The potential adaptation that shaped the extant human populations of the hot and dry environment of the Arabian Peninsula have been scarcelystudied. Materials and Methods: We explored natural selection in the Arabian Peninsula region by analyzing 662,750 singlenucleotide variants in 583 Kuwaiti and 96 Saudi Arabian individuals conducting multiple statistical tests, including integrated Haplotype Score (iHS), Cross PopulationExtended Haplotype Homozygosity (XP-EHH), (LLRS). Results: Our integrative approach identi ed several genomic regions with strong signals of positive selection in both the populations, many of which contain lociassociated with metabolic traits, asthma and blood-related phenotypes. We highlight a haplotype overlapping TNKS region in chromosome 8, associated with metabolic traitsand hypertension. The TNKS haplotype exempli es a general trend in which a more rapid metabolism rate and hypertension have been selected in the Kuwaiti population,and potentially conferred some degree of tness advantage to the Kuwaiti ancestors for surviving in the extremely dry and hot ecological environments, while posing a consider-able health risk to present-day Kuwaitis. Conclusions: Our results suggest that past adaptive trends have further predisposed Kuwaiti populations to thehealth risks at the genetic level. Overall, the mechanisms through which the TNKS haplotype conferred a tness advantage and how the same haplotype predisposes thepopulation to metabolic diseases remain fascinating and could be explored in future research.726 J. del PicchiaE.

However, diagnosing allergic disease in childhood remains challenging, espe- cially in young children. Methods: We aimed to predict the presence of allergic disease (i.e. either asthma, rhinitis or eczema in combination with 1 positive allergen-speci c IgE) in children. The model was built using data including lifestyle, environ- mental factors, genetic variation, and blood and nasal DNA methylation (450 K), collected from 348 subjects at 16years old from a birth cohort, with 67 children having allergic disease. Elastic net regulation was used to train the model. The model performance was validated by 10-foldcross validation and was replicated in an independent cohort with 481 children. Results: We observed that most predict power can be attributed to nasal DNA methylation. Other factors did not improve the prediction of allergic disease. The nal model was based on nasal DNA methylation levels at only 5 CpGswith the prediction performance of AUC 0.86 in theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 727discovery cohort and AUC 0.83 in the replication cohort. Matched nasal gene expression data was used to annotate these CpGs. Genes that were signi cantly correlated to the 5 CpGs were enriched in immune pathways including Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 signaling, neutrophil degranulation and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Conclusions: We present a prediction model for allergic disease based on only 5 CpGs from nasal epithelial cells. This model shows great potential to diagnose the presenceof allergic disease in children. C. Qi: None. M. van Breugel: A. Employment (full or part-time); Modest; MI company. Y. Jiang: None. I.

Kucinskas Vilnius University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Vilnius, Lithuania The aim of this study is to determine potential protective genome variants (PGVs) in the general Lithuanian popula-tion using project \"LITGEN\". Exome sequencing and high-throughput beadchip genotyping data analysis was performed for 98 and 466 subjects of theLithuanian descent, respectively. A catalog of 144 known PGVs was compiled using databases and publications. The catalog was set as a reference of PGVs for the LITGENdata. Allele frequencies were calculated and compared to the general European population as well as individual European populations based on 1000G project data. Sta-tistical analysis (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 2 or was performed. Six missense variants were sig- nicantly more frequent in the study group and may have protection against alcohol dependence (ADH1C , PGVs may reduce the risk of disease, there are additional genetic mechanisms that control this process. Not only the effects ofsingle genomic variants are important, but their interactions and interactions between regulatory elements as well.Detection of PGVs would not only provide a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis mechanisms and microevolutionary processes, but could also be used for the analysis for the development of novel therapies.

College London, London, United Kingdom,5Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway,6AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom,7Universitat de Barcelona (UB), Barce- lona, Spain Introduction: Human metabolism is in fluenced by genetic and environmental factors. Previous studies have identi ed >23 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with >28 urine metabolites levels (metabQTLs) in adults, but there are no publications in children. The aim of thepresent study is the identi cation of urinary metabQTLs in children. Material and Methods: Genome-wide association stu- dies (GWAS) of 44 urine metabolite levels measured with 1H NMR were conducted in 996 children from the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project. Results: Twelve statistically signi cant urine metabQTLs were identi ed, involving 11 unique loci and 10 different metabolites. Comparison with ndings in adults revealed that 6 metabQTLs were already known, 1 had been described in serum and 2 involved the same locus but different urinary metabolites. The remaining 2 metabQTLsrepresent (NIPSNAP3A) , that codes for a protein highly expressed in the kidneys that participates in the vesicular transport; and (ii) rs12575496 for taurine, which is in a gene desert region. We also found that urinary taurine levels wereaffected by the combined action of rs12575496 and dietary patterns of meat and beverages.728 J. del PicchiaConclusions: Overall, we identi ed 12 urinary metabQTLs in children, being 2 of them novel. A substantial part of the identi ed loci affected similarly urinary metabolite levels in children and in adults. The metabQTL for taurine seemed to be speci c to children and interacted with dietary patterns. K.B. None. M. Coen: None. M. Vrijheid: None. H. None. G. Escaram\u00eds: None. M. Bustamante: None. P19.082.B Population-scale variant discovery PacBio HiFi , S. B. Kingan, A. M. Wenger Pacic Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, United States Introduction: Catalogs of human variation continue to increase in scale, but they remain incomplete by relying on short-read sequencing and reference-based variant calling.Short reads have low sensitivity for structural variants (SVs, differences 50 bp), miss variants in segmental duplications that comprise 5-10% of human genome, and do not phasehaplotypes. Further, large sequences absent in the reference genome are ignored. Highly accurate long-read (HiFi) sequencing overcomes these limitations. Results: Long-read sequencing has used success- fully to create ethnicity-speci c reference genomes of Asian, African, and European populations. Each genomeadds up to 10 Mb of unique sequence beyond GRCh38 and provides a superior target against which to map short reads. We demonstrate that de novo assembly with HiFi readsreliably produces genomes that approach GRCh38 N50 >30 Mb, accuracy >Q55). HiFi reads also provide high precision and recall for variant detection at 15-fold coverage. For the Genome in a Bottle benchmark samples, DeepVariant and pbsv achievean F1 score of phase block N50 >100 kb. HiFi reads resolve 152 of 193 medicallyrelevant genes noted to be dif cult for short reads. Conclusions: We propose to improve catalogs of human variation using HiFi reads through: 1) de novo assembly ofa representative male and female from each subpopulation to discover novel sequences; and 2) whole-genome sequencing of thousands of individuals to discover smallvariants in dif cult regions and SVs part-time); Signi cant; Paci c Biosciences.

Frank2, A. Bovier1, P. Krawitz2 1Institute for Bonn, Germany,2Insti- tute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics, Bonn, Germany Despite increasing data from population-wide sequencing studies, the risk for recessive disorders in consanguineouspartnerships is still heavily debated. An important aspect that has not suf ciently been investigated theoretically, is the in fluence of inbreeding on mutation load and incidence rates when the population sizes change. We therefore developed an individual-based population model to study these dynamics for a wide range of growth and matingconditions. In the phase of population expansion and shortly afterwards, our simulations show that there is a drop of diseased individuals at the expense of an increasing muta-tion load for random mating. On the other hand both parameters remain almost constant in highly con- sanguineous partnerships. This explains the empiricalobservation in present times that a high degree of con- sanguinity is associated with an increased risk of autosomal recessive disorders. However, the simulations also state thatthe higher frequency of severe recessive disorders such as intellectual disability in inbred populations is a transient phenomenon before a mutation-selection balance is reachedagain. Mathematic simulations can help to gain new insights in processes, where several factors interact in a complex manner. L.A. La Rocca: None. J. Frank: None. A. Bovier: None. P. Krawitz: None.

A study by Dela- neau et al. (Science 364, eaat8266, 2019) used population- based chromatin data to identify domains(CRDs), which show cell type-speci c coordinated chro- matin activity, follow the local chromatin organization into topologically associated domains, and were observed tocontrol coexpression of nearby genes. Since CRDs are also under strong genetic control, they offer a great insight into the regulatory organization of the human genome. How-ever, chromatin data are not available for most human genetics 'studies, rendering the identi cation of CRDs expensive on a large scale. Therefore, we extend our pre-vious work to characterize regulatory organization of the genome using only gene expression data from RNA-seq studies and genotypes. Speci cally, we cantly correlated proximal genes with inter-individual coordinated expression patterns, and assess their temporal dynamics exploiting alongitudinal dataset from the MultiMuTHER study, including 336 individuals with whole-blood RNA-seq data collected at three time-points over seven years, and imputedgenotypes from the TwinsUK cohort. We identify genetic variants associated to the coordinated expression regulation of the CODs, as well as to their age-associated changes.Using the unique properties of twin studies, we perform a variance decomposition analysis to estimate COD- heritability. Finally, we perform association studies toclinically relevant phenotypes in an attempt to identifyCODs involved in the regulation of cardiometabolic traits such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.

The main population is Russian old settlers - rus- koustintsy. The ruskoustintsy have preserved old Russiantraditions and dialect typical for Russians of the 16th cen- tury, despite living ~400 years neighboring with indigenous Siberian populations (Paleo-Asiatic, Uralic, Tungusic andTurkic people) which have expanded in this territory in various historical period. In our days it 's amazing to see a Slavic population among the indigenous people of this land.The aim of this study is to analyze the autosomal diversity and to reconstruct genetic history of Russian old settlers living in the Arctic region. DNA samples of 30 unrelatedresidents of \"Russkoe Ust 'e\"were collected and genotyped OmniExpress 730K. The samples wereanalyzed using ADMIXTURE approach (Alexander et al., 2009). Final dataset included 192776 SNP 's presented in 5458 individuals from 365 different worldwide populations.

To further elucidate the genetic architecture, independent variants were classi ed into 89 (72%) cis-and 34 (28%) trans- acting pQTLs. Ten variants have con- sequences equal to or more severe than missense, and 33 overlap regulatory regions. We also discover variants that have previously been linked to psychiatric disorders. Forexample, an intronic trans- pQTL in the ITIH4 gene is associated with increased NEP levels ( rs2239547; P=1.19 x 10 129; BETA =0.637983; SE =0.026328), and is an established risk variant for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Gene by sex interactions (GxS) are thought to underlie some of this sexual dimorphism.However, the extent and basis of these interactions are poorly understood. Here we provide insights into both the scope and mechanism of GxS across the genome of circa 450,000 individuals of European ancestry and 530 complex traits in UK Biobank. We report sex differences in heritability for 71traits, through genetic correlations for 69 traits, and in associations of genetic variants located in the autosome and X-chromosome for 103 traits. We also show that sexspecic polygenic risk scores may lead to a modest improvement of phenotypic prediction and highlight howsex agnostic analyses could be missing loci of interest. Finally, we studied the potential functional role of this dimorphism through sex-biased eQTL and gene-level analyses. This study marks the largest examination of the genetics of sexual dimorphism to date. Our ndings parallel previous reports, proving the widespread presence of sexual genetic heterogeneity across complex traits, though be it of generally modest magnitude. This warrants the need forfuture studies to consider sex-stratifying analyses, in order to both shed light into possible sex-speci c molecular mechanisms as well as improve prediction of high-levelphenotypes.

P19.092.C Experimental system to enhance the discovery and translatability of causal links between host genetics and RSV-ALRI susceptibility A. Destouni Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, United States Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most signi cant cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) and ALRI caused deaths in children <5years of age globally. Heritability of RSV-ALRI is 20% indicating that extensive genotype-by-environment determine variation. In this context, RSV-ALRI GWA studies are underpowered, because adequately sized infant cohorts have been unattainable. Integrating GTEx eQTLs from adult lungs is not informative due to theage-dependent pulmonary/immune RSV induced responses. Materials and Methods: We developed an experimental system combining the BXD family of recombinant inbredstrains with the neonatal mouse model of infant RSV- immunopathology. We infected 28 BXD strains and measured levels of viral NS1 gene transcription in lungsto obtain quantitative measure of the host-virus interaction. Heritability of NS1 transcription was 67%. with Haley-Knott regression (5000 permutations and2000 bootstraps). The analysis 2 QTL intervals 14 (LRS =18.8, p=0.05) and 13 (LRS=11.34, p=0.63). , all map to homologous regions in our RSV intervals.Thus, quantifying the viral NS1 transcript level in the neonatal mouse model captures host variants in conserved732 J. del Picchiasequences with associations between host SNPs and bronchiolitis in human infants. Conclusions: With the neonatal BXD isogenic panel, we effectively boost heritability by reducing the environmental variance in an age-appropriate model. This resource is poised to expedite the discovery and translatability of causallinks between host genetics and RSV-ALRI susceptibility. A. Destouni: None. P19.094.B Periconceptional environment predicts leukocyte telo- mere length in a cross-sectional study of 7-9 year oldrural Gambian children K. Maasen 1,2,3, P. T. A. M.

Although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, maintenance of telomeres may be involved. We investigated the relationship between seasonaldifferences in parental environmental exposures at the time of conception in rural Gambia and leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in their offspring. Materials and Methods: LTL was measured in two cohorts of children aged 2 yrs ( N=487) and 7-9 yrs ( N= 218), using PCR. The associationbetween date of conception and LTL was examined using Fourier regression models with age, sex, leukocyte cell composition, maternal periconceptional BMI, child birthweight, maternal and infant supplementation, and maternal folate considered as potential confounders. Results: In the older children, we found evidence for an effect of season in a crude, seasonality only model [likelihood ratio test (LRT) \u00b22=8.27, p=0.016]. LTL was greatest in children conceived in September (in therainy season), and smallest in those conceived in March (in the dry season), with an effect size (LTL peak - nadir) of0.60 z-scores. This association remained after adjustment for multiple potential confounders. No effect of season was evident in the younger children (LRT \u00b22=4.24, p=0.12). Conclusions: Our results suggest that conception during the dry season in The Gambia could adversely in fluence telomere maintenance in postnatal tissues, resulting in adetectable effect on mean LTL by mid-childhood but not before 2 years of age.

Many studies revealed that age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise could result in shorter telomerelength. Several studies also reported signi cant associations between shorter TL and deregulated metabolic syndrome components. The study was aimed to evaluate if the telo-mere length and shorting are associated with cardio- metabolic components. Methods: A total of 2698 adults were recruited from the Matsu community-based integrated health screening pro- ject. Relative telomere length was determined at baseline and after ten years. Multiple regression analyses and GEEadjusting for other covariates were performed to examineAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 733the relationship between relative telomere length and cardio-metabolic components. Results: We found the metabolic syndrome group had signicantly longer TL attrition ( p=0.028), and higher TL attrition rate over 10 years ( p=0.014). We further found statistically signi cant associations between relative telo- mere length at baseline and elevation of body mass index (p=0.017), diastolic blood pressure ( p=0.043) at baseline as well as with the systolic blood pressure ( p=0.043) at the year 2015 after adjusting for age and gender. We also observed that the longer TL attrition was signi cantly associated with increased levels of fasting glucose(p=0.006), p=0.014), triglycerides (p=0.015), and total cholesterol ( at the year 2015.

Telomere length (TL) would be shortened during DNA replication. Manystudies revealed that age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, obesity, and lack of exercise were the factors linked with shorter TL length. Several studies reported signi cant associations between shorter TL and deregulated metabolic syndrome (MetS) components. Moreover, a few genetic loci asso- ciated with telomere length have been identi ed. The study was aimed to evaluate if the TL related genetic loci are associated with cardio-metabolic components.Methods: A total of 2543 adults were recruited from the Matsu community-based integrated health screening pro- ject. A total of 43 SNPs on 17 TL related genes were genotyped. Multiple regression analyses adjusting for other confounding covariates were performed to examine the relationship between TL related genetic loci and cardio-metabolic components. Results: We examined 43 SNPs in 17 genes and found these 43 SNPs had no signi cant associations with MetS, but some SNPs were related to MetS components. The results of multiple logistic regression showed that rs78975791, rs622961, rs11191853, rs2287641, rs622961 and rs1684149 were associated with increased sugar; rs4125537 was associated withelevated TG; rs13265931 wider waist circumference; rs13265931, rs4841210, and rs75877904 were associated with P-value <0.05).

P19.097.B Leukocyte telomere length is related to ymal fraction and attention/speed in the elderly: Resultsof the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study P. Gampawar , R. Schmidt, H. Schmidt Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria The role of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) in brain aging is controversial. Here we explored the association between LTL and 1) global MRI correlates of brain aging includingbrain parenchymal fraction (BPF), white matter hyper- intensities (WMH) as well as 2) global (g-factor) cognition and the cognitive domains of attention/speed, con-ceptualization, memory, and visuopractical skills in 909 participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study. There were 388(42.7%) men, and the mean age was 65.9 \u00b1 8.0years. larger WMH =0.03, p=0.04) after adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, and ApoE4 carrier status. The effect on BPF was more signicant in the subgroups of women ( p=0.001), ApoE4 allele ( signi cant association between LTL and the cognitive domain of attention/speed, which was conned to the subgroups of BMI 25 (=0.04, p=0.05) and education 10 years ( =0.04, p=0.05). The effect of LTL on attention/speed was in both sub- groups by BPF ( =0.02, 95% CI =0.01:0.03) when tested by bootstrapping. Our results support a strong protective role of longer LTL on global brain volume, which in turn may contribute to better cognitive functions, especially inthe attention/speed domain in the elderly.

It is, however, largelyunknown whether the risk factors are causal and bear potential signi cance for intervention. We attempted to investigate the causal relationship between thyroid cancerrisk and selected epidemiologic risk factors applying Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches Methods: A total of 17,935 healthy individuals from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study and 1,214 thyroid cancer cases from 2 hospitals were selected with epidemio- logic, clinical and genome information. Genetic risk scoresof BMI, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and height were constructed and used as instrumental variables (IV) to analyze the causal association in the two-sample IVanalyses. Additionally inverse-weighted variance, weighted median methods were performed to estimate the causaleffect size of TC risk. Further, MR-Egger regression was used to assess potential pleiotropic effects as well. Results: IV analyses demonstrated that BMI, FPG, and height GRS and risk of subgroups of TC did not show signicant associations. Pleiotropic effects were not found, and statistical power ranged from 0.67 to 0.79. Conclusion: Ourndings suggest that obesity and FPG may not be the potential intervention target to prevent TC risk, despite the ndings from observational studies. S. Lee: None. E. Lee: None. Y.

Recent studies from the Human Functional Genomics Project have successfully character- ized the impact of genetic and environmental factors onimmune response in health. However, how this variability relates to the risk of developing an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), is largely unknown. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 243 T1D and 534 healthy volunteers of Western European descent.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 735>200 immune cell populations and >100 cytokine-stimulus pairs were measured in both cohorts. We used a systems approach to comprehensively assess the impact of environ- mental and genetic factors on immune phenotypes. The results were compared between T1D patients and healthy controls. Results: Age and seasons show impact on both immune cell abundance and cytokine production upon stimulation, e.g. resting T regs show higher levels in summer. The T1Dassociated genetic factors show stronger impact on T cell than B cell subpopulations in peripheral blood (P=4.17 \u00d7 10 5, K.S. test), highlighting the importance of T cell immunity in T1D.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States,6Institute of Nutritional Science, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany Background: Delta 5-desaturase (D5D) and delta 6- desaturase (D6D) (estimated from fatty acids measured in blood fractions) were associated with cardiometabolic risk, however, causality needs to be clari ed. Material and Methods: We investigated causal effects of D5D and D6D activities on the risk of type 2 diabetes(T2DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) in two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. Selection of genetic instruments for D5D (20:4n-6/20:3n-6 ratio) and D6D activity (18:3n-6/18:2n-6 ratio) relied on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene-wide screens (restricted to the FADS -gene region that encodes for both desaturases) in a representative sub-cohort ( n=1853) of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutri- tion (EPIC)-Potsdam Study. Outcome associations weredrawn from DIAGRAM and GWAS. We applied univariable MRs (single desaturases) and multi- variable MR (combining both) and addressed confoundingby linkage disequilibrium (LD) as all instruments revealed ratio (OR) [95% on CAD. The multivariable MR could not unambiguously allocate a direct causal effect to either of the individual desaturases. Conclusions: Our results suggest that D6D is causally linked to cardiometabolic risk, which is likely due to downstream production of fatty acids and products resultingfrom high D6D activity. For D5D, higher T2DM risk reflects the genetic linkage with D6D rather than an independent effect. S. J\u00e4ger: None. R. Cuadrat: None. P. Hoffmann: None. C. Wittenbecher: None. M.B. Schulze: None.

In other viral infections, an antagonistic effect between IFN-and IFN- levels was described. We aimed to evaluate both a functional and genetic association of SNPs in the736 J. del Picchiainterferon-alpha kinase 2 over in CHC patients. Materials and Methods: Three IFNAR1 and two TYK2 SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan assays for evaluated IFNL3 ,IFNA1 , andIFNAR1 genes in 24 patients strati ed by genotypes, considering different time points (0-1-3-12 weeks of treatment), using Biomark-HD System. Mann-Whitney,Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn\u00b4s post-test was Heterozygous CHC patients at TYK2 rs12720356 presented an association with a high baseline viral load (OR =2.0/CI 1.1-3.7/ advanced brosis. IFNAR1 SNPs were not associated with any of the outcomes tested. No differences were observed when comparing IFNA1 , IFNAR1 andIFNL3 levels between the different treatment time points. Stratifying according to the different SNP genotypes, only higher IFNL3 levels were signi cantly different in IFNAR1 rs2843710-G carriers. Due to low sample size gene expression levels were not strati ed for TYK2 genotypes. Conclusions: High baseline viral load and advanced brosis in CHC patients were associated with TYK2 polymorphisms, which is consistent with the role of thisSNP in TYK2 function controlling viral replication.

Nevruz2, flas2 of Biology, Faculty of Science, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey,2Genoks Genetic Disease Diagnostic Center, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: In recent years, low-coverage whole-genome sequencing has become the method of choice for non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to evaluate the most com- mon chromosome aberrations. Although nearly all WGS-generated NIPT data analysis is limited to detect common trisomies, the possible re-use of NIPT data increasinglybecomes popular and expanding. Here, we systematically analyzed NIPT data at the population-scale to characterize the virome in maternal plasma. Materials and Methods: A total of 13,802 NIPT data were generated from Turkish pregnant women during the period of 2018-2019 at Genoks Diagnostic Center.Sequencing was performed on BGI SEQ-500, producing 35-bp single-end reads. Following quality ltering, clean reads that did not map to human reference genome wereblasted against the NCBI viral reference sequence database (release 97). Only matching reads with e-value < 1e-10, a percent identity 97 and alignment length 32 bp were kept for further analysis. After removing alignments to bacteriophages, remaining alignments were used for virus abundance estimation. Results: About 110 billion clean reads from 13,802 sam- ples were used for pro ling plasma virome, 3947 samples (28.6%) have at least one viral hit and 607 samples (4.4%)have at least two signi cant alignment hits. Human herpesvirus 6A and 6B, hepatitis B virus and human endogenous retrovirus K were enriched in terms ofprevalence and abundance. The maternal blood in the Turkish population was appeared to have a different viral distribution compared to pregnant Europeans and Chinese. Conclusions: WGS-generated NIPT data can be a powerful approach for detecting circulating viral DNAs. V. Eldem: None. E. Akdeniz: None. B. Nevruz: None. I.M. Tekin: H. G. D. n:None. M. Aslan: M.

In the present study we performed a genome-wide methylation analysis in order to characterize the methylation differences among groups. Materials and Methods: A total of 18 blood DNA samples from 3 different ALS families were collected for the study, including 4 ALS patients, 10 presymptomatic/ paucisymptomatic carriers, and 4 non-carrier relatives. Allthe samples were processed with reduced representation bisulte sequencing (RRBS) and analyzed using RnBeads pipeline. Results: A preliminary multidimensional scaling analysis of the dataset suggests that, despite coming from different families, the 4 ALS patients share a similar methylationpattern across more than 23.000 investigated CpG islands, that can be distinguished from the patterns observed in non- carriers of ALS-linked SOD1 mutations. By contrast, presymptomatic/paucisymptomatic carriers show a more heterogeneous CpG island methylation pro le. We are now cleaning the dataset from confounding factors in order toreveal the gene promoters and the pathways that are differentially methylated among groups. Conclusions: The present investigation takes advantage of well characterized families enriched in presymptomatic/ paucisymptomatic carriers of ALS-linked SOD1 mutations and could help revealing preclinical methylation signaturesof the disease.

Monferrato, Turin,Italy, 11Cancer Epidemiology Unit, CPO Piemonte, Turin, Italy,12Interdepartmental Particulates \"G. Scansetti\", University ofTurin, Turin, Italy, Salute e della Scienza, Turin, Italy Introduction: Although the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) are incomple- tely understood, chronic in flammation is critically involved in the pathogenesis as a possible result of asbestos expo- sure. Age is one of the strongest predictors of chronic dis- ease and mortality, but biological responses to aging differamong people and can have an important role in the con- sideration of the relationship with disease-related covari- ates. Aging eludes precise de nition at the systemic level and denotes a multitude of processes at the cellular level. Material and Methods: We investigated a cohort of 300 subjects exposed between 2000 and 2010. Usingmethylation-based \"clock\" (Horvath), namely extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA), we de ned biological age acceleration for each of three hundred asbestos-exposedsubjects. EEAA is de ned as the weighted average of DNAm age and imputed proportions of na\u00efve CD8 + T cells, memory CD8 +T cells and plasmablasts. Asbestos exposure-related variation in age acceleration measures and 95% con dence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multiple regression models. Results: EEAA showed that biological age acceleration was statistically signi cantly associated with increased asbestos les have been used as indices of biological age and the roles of epigenetic age accelerationmeasures were investigated. Our results suggest the potential application of DNAm pro les, considering age acceleration measures, in blood to develop non-invasivetests for asbestos-exposed subjects. In detail, epigenetic age acceleration may play a role as a proxy of internal dose of asbestos exposure. G. Cugliari: None. A. Allione: None. S. Guarrera: None. C. Viberti: None. F. Grosso: None. E.

MA, United States,3Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, Boston, MA, United States,4IFOM, the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, Neurology, Harvard Medical Institute of Molecular Genetics \"Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza \", Pavia, Italy Disruptive mutations in helicase DNA binding protein 8 ( CHD8 ) have been recurrently and inde- pendently associated Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).In normal cellular physiology, CHD8 co-puri es with MLL1 and MOF transcriptional activation complex, elongating RNAPII and directly binds to DNA promotersand enhancers regions, thus a regulatory role in transcrip- tional initiation and elongation could be postulated. Here we investigated how chromatin landscape reacts to CHD8 suppression by analyzing a panel histone modi cations in induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitors. We interrogated transcriptionally active and repressedregions as well as active and poised enhancers. CHD8 suppression leads to a signi cant reduction (47.82%) H3K36me3 at gene impactingon transcriptional elongation chromatin states. Highly expressed, CHD8-bound genes present a stronger and more signicant H3K36me3 reduction compared to CHD8 unbound genomic regions. \"macromolecule catabolic \",\"cell cycle \"and\"mRNA processing \"biological processes and enriched for \"essential and constrained genes \",'FMRP targets in brain ','post synaptic genes ', whose expression peaks early during nervous system. Sig-nicantly, CHD8 -suppression associated histone H3K36me3 reduction does not functionally impact on global transcriptional levels, but signi cantly correlates with altered alternative splicing pattern of ~ 2000 protein coding genes implicated in \"RNA splicing \",\"mitotic cell cycle phase transition \"and\"mRNA processing \", especially affecting alternative rst exon and exon skipping events. In summary, our results point toward broader molecularconsequences of CHD8 suppression, implicating altered histone deposition/maintenance and RNA processing reg- ulation as important regulatory processes in ASD.

The relationship between BPAexposure and ICPP in girls is still unde ned. Changing of methylation levels of target genes of DNA methyl- transferases (DNMTs) and HPG axis may be epigeneticregulation mechanism of BPA exposure induced ICPP in girls Objectives: To investigate the relationship between BPA exposure and ICPP in girls and the epigenetic reg-ulation mechanism. Methods: 157 6-9 years old girls diagnosed as precocious puberty were recruited from Shanghai Children 's Medical Center from July 2017 to August 2018. After detailed laboratory examinations, 56 girls of them were diagnosed as ICPP. At the same time, 56 healthy 6-9 years girls wererecruited as control group. All of the participants 'urinary BPA concentrations were detected. Methylation levels of CpG islands of target genes from peripheral blood sampleswere detected for 56 ICPP girls and 56 healthy girls. Results: Cases in higher urinary BPA concentration groups were associated with higher risk of ICPP [speci c gravity (SG) adjusted BPA concentration adjusted) group was associated with higher level of methylation of CpG islands of DNMT3B (Z=-1.792, p=0.037).

Breteler1,3 Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Bonn, Germany,2Department of University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany,3Institute for Medical Biometry, Informatics and Epidemiology (IMBIE), Faculty of Medi-cine, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany Introduction: DNA methylation-based biomarkers of aging (DNAm aging) are associated with cardiometabolic dis- eases. Although this may be due to their relation with car- diometabolic risk factors, limited data are available on theassociation between cardiometabolic risk factors and DNAm aging in the general population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Rhineland Study, a population-based prospective cohort study in Bonn, Germany. Four types of DNAm aging acceleration estimates (including AgeAccel.Horvath, AgeAccel.Hannum, AgeAccelPheno, and AgeAc- celGrim), de ned as within individual differences between the epigenetic and chronological age, were calculated. Theeffects of 20 cardiometabolic risk factors on DNAm aging acceleration were assessed using multiple linear regressions. Results: Among 3327 participants (mean age 55.0 years (range 30 -95), 56.0% women), 14 risk factors were signicantly associated with AgeAccelPheno [change in years (95% CI) per standard deviation increase]: -0.67 (-0.91, -0.44), body index 0.99 (0.68, 1.31), waist circumference 1.03 (0.78, 1.28) and percentage body fat 0.90 (0.64, 1.15). were obtainedwhen using AgeAccelGrim, AgeAccel.Horvath or AgeAc- cel.Hannum as outcomes (data not shown). Conclusions: Multiple cardiometabolic risk factors were consistently associated with various DNAm aging accel- eration, which may underlie the association between DNAm aging and cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality.D.

Olthoff, A. Shaked University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identi ed thousands of loci associated with human traits. However, the causal variant, gene, cell type, and mechanism under-lying these associations remain unclear. Most GWAS var- iants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with variants, complicating mechanistic characterization. Cell-type speci c gene reg- ulation plays a causal role at many complex trait-associated loci. Changes in chromatin accessibility are key mechan-isms leading to gene expression differences. To understand the mechanisms that lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality worldwide, we quanti ed chromatin accessibility in more than 200 human liver tissue samples. We identify more than 500,000 open chromatin regions, many of which exhibit tissue-speci c activity, and identify transcription factor binding sites at nucleotide resolution. Integration with epigenomic pro les identi ed specic cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. thousands of cis-regulatory ele- ments whose GWAS signals generate speci c hypotheses about causal variants, affected genes, and cell types. With a combination of experimental approaches in multiple model systems, we ne-map complex trait-associated loci to single-nucleotide bene inte- grating multiple cellular for cation and characterization of disease-causing variants and contributeto basic understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

P20.14.B DNA methylation pro le Cystic Fibrosis Gagua, State Medical University, Tbilisi, GeorgiaIntroduction: Cystic brosis (CF) is the most common lethal monogenetic disease in the Caucasian population. Genetic and epigenetic modi ers may play a considerable role in the phenotypic heterogeneity of CF disease. Methylenetetrahy-drofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key regulatory enzyme in the metabolism of folate. A common variant of the MTHFR gene, C677T, is associated with variety of disorders, includ-ing cancer, chronic in flammation and etc. In this study we investigated the DNA methylation level of the LINE-1 and Alu interspersed repetitive sequences (IRS) in CF patientswith the C677T variant of the MTHFR gene. Materials and methods: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tbilisi State Medical University. Allpatients were genotyped for the CFTR gene. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CF patients using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit(Qiagen, US). For Bisul te treatment of DNA we used EpiTect Bisul te Conversion Kit (Qiagen, US). The MTHFR C677T was detected by PCR-RELP method. Methylation levels of LINE-1 and Alu were examined by the combined bisul te restriction analysis- interspersed repetitive sequences (COBRA-IRS). Results: Signi cant differences were observed in methy- lation levels of both LINE-1 and Alu sequences between CF patients with CC and TT genotypes. In patients with TTgenotypes, frequency of uCuC (unmethylated Cytosine) was lower than in patients genotypes. Conclusions: Our results indicated that identi cation of CF patients with the MTHFR C677T variant and study of DNA methylation levels may be useful for personalized treatment approaches. M.

Development of chromatin conformation study techniques has identi ed several long-range regulatory elements of CFTR gene. 17 cis-regulatory regions of CFTR gene have been sequenced in 63 CBAVD patients. By comparing to European popu- some variants display a frequency signi cantly dif- ferent. In particular, one variant located in cis-regulatory region of intron 21, is 40 times more frequent in this group. Activity tests in Caco-2 intestinal cells have shown strongcooperative effects of the intron 21 enhancer with several strong enhancers speci c to intestinal cells (Intron 1, 11 and at+15.6kb of the CFTR gene) on CFTR promoter activity. Insertion of the interest variant into intron 21 shows a strong decrease of CFTR promoter activity and the loss of enhancers cooperation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) analyses of HNF1a and EP300 transcription factors have shown their xations in intron 1, 11 and 21 enhancers ofCFTR gene. This variant could affect the recruitment of regulatory elements. In conclusion, some signi cantly var- iants are identi ed in CBAVD patients incomplete genotype, notably one regulatory variant localised in theintron 21 enhancer of CFTR gene. This region plays an important role in regulation of CFTR locus in combining with 3 others intestinal speci c enhancers. M. Collobert: None. K. Rouault: None. C. L 'Hostis: None. M.

Kilpel\u00e4inen, M. P. Gillum Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Copenhagen, Denmark Obesity is a major contributor to global burden of chronic disease, in particular type 2 diabetes and cardiovasculardisease. There is currently a great unmet need for devel- oping effective and safe anti-obesity treatments. Genomic studies provide novel molecular targets for the treatment ofobesity by discovering genes and pathways involved in obesity. We have recently identi ed an association between the rare variant Ser316Cys in CYR61 , implicated in angiogenesis, and increased body fat percentage ( P=1.1 x 109), in particular trunk fat percentage (3.8 x 1011). The Cys316 minor allele was associated with a 0.4 % higher body fat percentage and 0.5% higher trunk fat percentage.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 741In a mouse model overexpressing human Cyr61 (hCyr61) in the fat tissue, we show that the hCyr61-overexpression leads to increased body fat percentage under high fat diet, due to a switch in body composition, while body weight did not differ from wild type mice. The endogenous Cyr61 remained unaffected by hCyr61, but is abundantlyexpressed in all fat depots, clearly supporting our hypoth- esis of CYR61 being involved in fat tissue development. Our results suggest a critical role of CYR61 in the regulation of body composition and adipocyte development, which may be mediated by adipogenesis. Ongoing in vitro and in vivo experiments will provide further insights intothe mechanistic role of Cyr61 in the development of obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Ultimately, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of adipogenesis and CYR61 may enable new therapeutic options for the treatment of obesity by lowering fat mass and retaining lean mass. S.

Greece; e-NIOS Applications PC, Palma, Spain 22q11DS is caused by a recurrent 3Mb deletion present in 90 % of patients. Despite this genomic homogeneity there is a great phenotypic variability. This indicates the existence of genetic and/or epigenetic modi ers. Which are exactly these modi ers and, in particular, how they act is still poorly de ned, but diet could be one of the candidates. Our hypothesis is that altered vitamin A (vitA) levels in the dietof pregnant mothers could modify the penetrance of one of the phenotypic traits (Aortic Arch Defects; AADs). Weused a mouse model (Df1) with a hemizygous deletion equivalent to the human 22q11.2DS. Our experimental setup consisted of 3 diet groups (vitA-supplemented, -control and vitA-de cient) and 2 types of crosses between Df1 mothers with WT fathers and WT mothers with Df1 fathers. Embryos were collected at gestational day E18.5and phenotyped. Serum retinol levels were determined in the blood of the pregnant females. AADs are more frequent in the Df1 embryos of WT mothers fed a vitA supplementeddiet (47 %) than in those fed with a vitA de cient diet (29%). On the contrary, when the mother is Df1 we observe more AADs in Df1 embryos of mothers fed a vitA de cient diet (45 %) than in those fed a supplemented diet (27%). In general, independently of the diet, we nd a correlation of higher frequencies of AADs with lower expression ofmitochondrial genes, and lower expression of key heart development genes. Ongoing studies on genome differential methylation will also be presented. E. Amengual-Cladera: None. D. Medina Chavez: None. E. Lynton Pons: None. Sureda Horrach: None. Asensio Landa: J.

P20.20.B The Reversion Curve of cg05575921 Methylation in Response to Smoking Cessation: A New DynamicEpigenetic Tool for Monitoring and Incentivizing Smoking Cessation . R. A. Philibert , K. Dawes, M. Dogan, W. Philibert, B. Hundley, J. Mills, J. Long, A. Gerke, J. Wilson, P. Nagpal, A. Comellas, E. Hoffman University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States Current methods for assessing and monitoring the effec- tiveness of smoking cessation are either unreliable (i.e. CO monitors) or confounded by use of nicotine replacement(i.e. cotinine assays). This prevents the use of highly effective, socially responsive, incentive-based reinforce- ment smoking cessation therapies. Recent developments inepigenetics may address this shortcoming. Previously, we have shown that a methylation sensitive digital PCR (MSdPCR) assay of DNA methylation at cg05575921 canprecisely quantitate current cigarette consumption using DNA from saliva or whole blood. However, whether changes in that DNA methylation can be used to monitorthe effectiveness of smoking cessation was uncertain. To determine this, we monitored serum cotinine and742 J. del Picchiadetermined DNA methylation levels for ninety days in 63 subjects participating in a nicotine replacement-free incentive based smoking cessation program. (NIH R01 HL130883) Overall, 18 of 63 (29%) subjects had unde- tectable levels of cotinine at the 30 day visit and maintained undetectable levels through the 90 day exit visit. Corre-spondingly, cg05575921 levels showed a marked time and dose-dependent reversion of methylation with cg05575921 levels increasing over 10% with 3 months of cessation inthe heaviest smokers (initial cg05575921< 50%), while levels in more moderate smokers increasing only 7% after 3 months. We conclude that MSdPCR cg05575921assessments are a sensitive, rapid method of monitoring the effectiveness of smoking cessation. Because these DNA methylation levels are not affected by nicotine replacementand are quantitative in nature, they can be used in socially responsible, incentive-based programming for the quanti- tative reduction of smoking induced harms.

P20.21.C Leveraging a co-methylation network to predict regula- tory effects of DNA methylation sites and humanphenotypes S. Li , C. Qi, P. Deelen, F. Boulogne, N. de Klein, J. van der Velde, G. Koppelman, L. Franke, M. Swertz, H. Centre Groningen, Nether- lands DNA methylation is an important epigenetic signal with potential regulatory effects on gene expression, and aberrant methylation patterns have been previously used as bio- markers for disease. While we have shown recently thatmethylated DNA sites are correlated with gene expression levels in blood, the function of many other DNA methyla- tion sites and co-methylation, however, is unclear. Previousstudies have used gene co-expression networks to predict links between genes and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Here, we compare co-methylation and co-regulation patterns, and investigate the functions of DNA methylation sites to improve gene-symptom predictions. For this purpose, we have created a co-methylation network using 33,000 public 450k Illumina methylation assays from various tissues and cell identi ed6,067 signi cant correlations between DNA methylation and genes through a meta-analysis using blood, nasal and brain tissues. These correlations link methylation sites with genes, and consequently to HPO terms associated with those genes. Using this data, we will compare the co- methylation network with our previously published co-expression network consisting of 32,000 samples in terms of their power to predict HPO term membership per gene and methylation site. We expect that this comparison willassign methylation sites to human phenotypes, and provide functional interpretation for many others. Our preliminary results comparing networks in 2905 blood samples show that the co-methylation and co- expression networks have comparable predictive power. In the future, we will combine the two networks to improveprioritization of disease-causing genes. S. Li: None. C. Qi: None. P. Deelen: None. F. Boulogne: None. N. de Klein: None.

Hwang Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea, Republic of As environmental pollution is getting worse, many envir- onmental diseases are caused by various factors. For this reason, the importance of research between environmentally harmful substances and diseases is increasing. In particular,exposure to harmful substances during pregnancy affects the fetus and can lead to disease. Therefore, epigenome was studied to con rm the change caused by environmental factors. The effect of heavy metals on atopic dermatitis, which is representative of environmental diseases, was examined using DNA methylation experiments, one of themethods for identifying epigenomes. The samples used in this study were cord blood DNA from some MOCEH cohort samples. The degree of methylation according to theconcentration of heavy metals was con rmed in 84 children diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. For methylation pro les, an experiment was performed using an In nium Human Methylation EPIC kit (Illumina, CA, USA) and analyzed using GenomeStudio (version 2011.1). As a result, 37 genes in mercury and 58 in lead were found in regions with sig-nicant methylation differences when exposed to high concentrations compared to low concentrations. Pathway analysis was performed using genes selected from eachheavy metal group, and it was con rmed that speci c genes were involved in the cytokine signaling in Immune system.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 743In conclusions, the effect of heavy metals on atopic der- matitis was con rmed. In other words, it was con rmed that environmental diseases may be caused by harmful envir- onmental substances.

Cherry Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is an international collaboration of research groups funded by the NHGRI, whose main goal is to identify all functionalelements of the human genome. The ENCODE portal (https://www.encodeproject.org/ ), established and main- tained by the ENCODE Data Coordination Center (DCC),provides unrestricted access to data generated by the members of the ENCODE consortium and other related projects such as Model organism Encyclopedia of Reg-ulatory Networks (modERN), Genomics of Gene Regula- ENCODE G-TEx (EN-Tex). The DCC develops andupdates the data model and uniform processing pipelines that allow transparency and reproducibility of the experi- mentally collected and computationally generated data.With a constant in flux of data, the DCC consistently implements new ways for the users of the ENCODE portal to search and identify related experiments, understand howassays were performed, and track the provenance of the data. Currently, the ENCODE portal hosts more than 15 thousand datasets, representing experimental results forover 75 distinct tissue and cell types using more than 40 distinct high-throughput genomic assays. Richness, diversity, and structure of the data on the ENCODE portal make it an invaluable resource for the scienti c community. The presence of curated and standar- dized results from assays Hi-C allow for convenient accessibility to any genomics investigator. Here we show how theENCODE portal can be used as a multifaceted lens to investigate various biological and regulatory properties of chromatin state and gene expression. U24HG009397-01 J.N. Au: None.

France, D. P. Callegari, B. M. Barbosa, A. A. S. Takeda, J. M. Sforcin SAO PAULO STATE UNIVERSITY - UNESP, Botucatu, Brazil Introduction: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer frequently associated with resistance to chemotherapy, a higher risk of recurrenceand metastasis. Combined epi-drugs targeting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and (HDACs) are a promising alternative to reverse acquiredtherapy resistance. Since natural origin products are con- sidered a promising source of epi-drugs, the present study aimed to identify propolis-derived small molecules able tointeract with human DNMT1 or HDAC2. Materials and Methods: The effects of propolis treatment were evaluated in four TNBC cell lines (BT-20,BT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-436). Cell viability was accessed by the MTT test and the DNA methylation analysis was performed by Methylation-Speci c Polymer- ase Chain Reaction (MS-PCR). A set of 3,146 propolis- derived compounds were retrieved from scienti c literature and used in the molecular screening strategy. Results: Propolis reduces the cell viability of TNBC cells and partly demethylates the promoter region of the tumor suppressor RASSF1A as well as modulates the RASSF1protein expression levels in cells. After ltering and curating 1,002 propolis-derived chemicals, 58.5% of the molecules were grouped into ve most representative clusters according to the components 'atomic positions. After hierarchical clustering, the in silico screening analysis indicated catechin 3 '-O-gallate and propolin-B as possible new DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, respectively.744 J. del PicchiaConclusions: Our data indicate that propolis can modulate the expression of the RASSF1 gene via epigenetic mechanisms. Also, the computational approach predicted that propolis-derived compounds can interact with DNMT1 and HDAC2 and should considered in future studies P20.29.B Line 1 methylation patterns in placenta and cord blood at birth reveal associations with neonatal weight and maternal methylation O. Rondinone1, Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Studi 'Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy During intrauterine life, environmental perturbations can influence newborn outcome by means of DNA methylation modications with long-term consequences. L-1 (Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements) sequences are transpo- sable elements accounting for 17% of the human genome, considered a surrogate for global methylation. To investi-gate the global methylation at birth in association with neonatal birth, we recruited at the delivery 195 women with singleton, spontaneous and uncomplicated pregnancies andwe investigated L-1 methylation by pyrosequencing in cord and maternal blood and in placental samples. We found a signicant severe L-1 hypomethylation in placenta from SGA (Small for Gestational Age, 10 percentile) compared with normal and LGA babies (Large for Gestational Age). This nding suggests a compensatory epigenetic mechan- ism in response to a reduced growth; or a placental insuf- ciency responsible for SGA. This association was not present in cord blood. A strong correlation (Pearson r =0,79, pvalue<0,01) of L-1 methylation 63,3% +/- 5,4) blood was found. This similarity seems to be lost after birth, basedon the weak correlation ( r=0,26, pvalue > 0,05) observed in the L-1 methylation levels of 31 mothers and children(>4 years of age). In order to explore also the methylation proling of gene promoters in these cases, MethylSeq experiments are ongoing. O. Rondinone: None. S. Motta: None. P. Colapietro: None. J. Costanza: None. M.

Barge-Schaapveld5, Centre, London, ON, Canada,4Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy,5Leiden University Medical Estonia, of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium Introduction: Histones regulate dynamic packaging of nuclear DNA in chromatin to achieve ef cient compaction of the genome as well as to regulate and coordinate DNAreplication, transcription, and repair. Recently, a narrow spectrum of functionally equivalent frameshift mutations at the C-terminal tail of HIST1H1E, a member of the linkerhistone family, has been causally linked to Rahman syn- drome. Previous work demonstrated that these mutations disrupt proper compaction of DNA and affected multiplecellular processes, resulting in accelerated replicative senescence, and are associated with a speci c methylation pattern. Results: Methylome analysis from peripheral blood samples of six affected subjects led us to identify ~9,000 CpG probes located in ~600 differentially methylatedregions, de ning a speci c and predominantly hypomethy- lated pattern. This \"episignature \"was enriched for genes involved in neuronal system development and function, inparticular at the synaptic level.

Conclusions: We demonstrate an epigenetic signature in subjects with a de ned class of HIST1H1E mutations. We show that this signature is speci c and can be used to reach molecular diagnosis.

The aim of this study is toidentify new genes involved in the germline predisposition to CRC, by means of an exhaustive functional character- ization of genetic variants previously prioritized by ourresearch group in familial CRC cases. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 75 patients with familial CRC with an unknown germline basis from 40families by whole-exome sequencing. An external replica- tion cohort of 473 families was also examined by targeted-gene sequencing. We developed a FAF1 knockout cellular model by CRISPR-Cas gene editing, and the identi ed genetic variants were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed by transfection. Apoptosis, proliferation and protein-speci c functional assays were carried out to characterize FAF1 role in cancer predisposition. Results: A predicted pathogenic FAF1 variant (c.1111G>A; p.Asp371Asn) was detected in the initial cohort segregating in four patients of the same family. Asecond genetic variant was detected in the replication cohort (c.254G>C; p.Arg85Pro). Both variants showed protein instability and, once transfected, produced an abnormalcellular phenotype by promoting apoptosis resistance and both NF- and Wnt signaling pathways.

Heilmann-Heimbach1 1Institute of Human Genetics; University of Bonn, School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany, 2Monasterium Laboratory, Skin and Hair Research Solu- tions, M\u00fcnster, Germany,3Department of Neuropathology; University of Bonn Medical Center, Bonn, Germany One of the strongest genetic risk loci for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is located in WNT10A (2q35). Here, a signicant regulatory effect of the lead variants on the expression of the hair cycle regulator WNT10A has been746 J. del Picchiareported. Interestingly, one of these variants is located within a binding site for the transcription factor EBF1, whose gene is located at another AGA risk locus (5q33.3). We hypothesized that changes in EBF1 mediated regulation ofWNT10A expression may contribute to the deregulated hair cycle dynamics observed in AGA. To analyze apotential interaction between EBF1 and WNT10A , we per- formed luciferase reporter assays HEK Our experiments con rmed that EBF1 activates the WNT10A promoter and that the WNT10A /EBF1 interaction was decreased with the AGA risk allele. To further investigate this potential interaction in AGA-relevant tissue and iden-tify the relevant cell population we performed immuno- fluorescence co-staining in human scalp and WNT10A wasobserved in hair follicle keratinocytes of the inner and outer root sheath. A major challenge in complex genetics is to bridge the gap between association and function. To ourknowledge, our study is the rst functional follow-up study on AGA that (i) together with previous mRNA data enabled identi cation of a regulatory mechanism at an AGA risk locus and (ii) proves functional interaction between two risk loci that is likely to contribute to the pathophysiological changes in hair cycle dynamics.

However,little is known about how the patient 's heart epigenetically responds to pathogenic truncating variants (tv) in the MYBPC3 gene that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a devastating cardiac disease with high morbidity and mortality. Methods and Results: To address the interplay between the chromatin activity and the subsequent RNA and protein products in patients, we performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics on human cardiac tissues from 13tvMYBPC3 HCM patients and 10 healthy donors. We identi ed 9,310 differentially acetylated regions and 2,033 differentially expressed genes between patients and controlsusing Deseq2. Gene enrichment analysis showed biological processes mostly in extracellular matrix formation and lipid metabolism. Besides, we identi ed a list of TFs that showed altered mRNA expression levels and the acetylation levels of their binding regions were altered. We also obtained top 2,000 regions and genes that were driving the majorvariation among all samples using O2PLS. Allelic imbal- ance of wild type and mutated MYBPC3 mRNA expression was observed. After combining results from bothapproaches in patients vs. controls, we further detected the expression levels of 45 proteins signi cantly changed in the same direction as changes in their encoding genes.Notably, several identi ed proteins have not been linked to HCM previously. Conclusions: Our integrated omics analysis identi ed novel candidates involved in cellular remodeling and dysfunction in tvMYBPC3 HCM. J. Pei: None. M. Schuldt: None. E. Nagyova: None. Z. de None.

Though speci c CIDs are associated with locus- specic imprinting defects, a subset of cases showed mul- tiple imprinting defects across the genome (multi-locus imprinting disturbances (MLIDs)). MLID has been descri-bed in a broad ranfge of CIDS but most frequently Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), The specic MLIDs on clinical phenotype is not well dened though some patients with MLID will have a dis- cordant epigenotype-phenotype (e.g. clinical features of SRS and molecular ndings associated with SRS). The availability of an accurate, quantitative and scalable high-throughput method to interrogate many imprinted regions simultaneously would be advantageous for MLID research and clinical diagnostics. We have designed a custom tar-geted methylation sequencing panel that covered the most relevant imprinting DMRs. We tested ImprintSeq in healthy specic methylation defects, as well as provides a useful tool to explore the signi cance of MLID in CIDs.

First, we used statistical analyses to prioritize these CpGs. An EWAS on BMI 8). We then applied transcription wide analyses (Illumina-HumanHT-12v3 array) and assessed methylation pro le correlation in all 23 CpGs at the locus using samples form associated with only the LGALS3BP transcript (P<4.9x10 08), three of which over- lap BMI hits. All associated CpGs are contained in a maincluster region. Based on our results, we selected BMI-associated CpGs for functional analyses.

Our ndings support speci c molecular mechanisms involved at each of the CpGs, providing new insights into the underlying functional basis in fluenced by BMI- associated methylation at the LGALS3BP locus.

Furthermore, constitu- tional monoallelic mutations in the same gene cause schwannomatosis, a cancer-prone disorder clinically distinctfrom NS. LZTR1 has been suggested to act as substrate receptor for the CUL3-RING poly-ubiquitination. Here we demonstrate that dominant NS-causing mutations do not influence protein stability and subcellular localization nor perturb binding of LZTR1 to CUL3, but cally affect the surface of LZTR1 Kelch mediating recognition. On the contrary, recessive NS-causing variantsbehave as loss-of-function mutations, affecting LZTR1 synthesis, stability, and/or binding to CUL3. Col- lectively, our data suggest a model in which LZTR1 con-tributes to the ubiquitination of proteins functioning as positive modulators of the RAS-MAPK pathway.

The placental methylome could be a marker of this interaction and re flect the functional changes derived from in utero exposures. Methods: To assess whether pre-pregnancy maternal BMI is associated with DNA methylation in placenta wecombined DNA methylation data from 11 cohorts of the PACE consortium (AQUA, EARLI, EDEN, Gen3G, GENEIDA, HEBC, 450K (n=1,955) arrays.

Finally, we placental using the GWAMA software ( xed effects). Preliminary results: We identi ed 51 and 39 BMI- associated CpGs passing Bonferroni correction with and without cell-type adjustment, respectively. Among thegenes closest to the signi cant CpGs, we found obesity- related genes such as GPX1 ,BBS9 ,EBF2 orPPP2R2A ; 2 diabetes DDAH1 ,CMIP andSGSM2 , and a number of developmental players, suggesting that maternal BMI impacts the epigenetic regulation of health- related genes in placenta. In the near future, we willascertain the functional impact of these signatures in placental transcription, and their interaction with the genomic variation of children and mothers.

Georgia,3Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University, Batumi, Georgia Introduction: Epigenetic alterations may have a role in the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as Migraine. This study aimed to determine the methylation level of the Line-1 and Alu interspersed repetitive sequences in migraine patients with C677T variant of MTHFR gene as well as methylation status of the TNF- and IL-8 gene promoters. Materials and methods: The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tbilisi State Medical University. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) of migraine patients and healthy controls using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, US). For Bisul te treatment of DNA, we used EpiTect Bisul te Conversion Kit (Qiagen, US). The MTHFR was detected by PCR-RELP method.Methylation levels of Line-1 and Alu in were examined by the combined bisul te restriction analysis-interspersed repetitive sequences (COBRA-IRS). Methylation levels of TNF- and IL-8 in patients controls were examined by methylation-speci c real-time qPCR. Results: For Alu sequences, signi cant differences were observed in the frequency of unmethylated Cytosines between PBMCs of patients with MTHFR C677T poly- and healthy controls. However, no statisticallysignicant differences for LINE-1 were detected. In addition, our results showed signi cant low level of methylation in TNF- and IL-8 promoters in the migraine patients than those in healthy controls (p 0.05). Conclusions: We demonstrated that changes in the DNA methylation of IRS elements and genes involved ininflammation might contribute to the pathogenesis of migraine in patients with MTHFR C677T variant. Such research could lead to the discovery of diagnosticbiomarkers and therapeutic targets. N. Kraveishvili: None. M. Kvintradze: None. S. Surmava: None. M. Zarandia: None. T. Gorgiladze: None. E.

Lancet Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, IsraelNon-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, amounting to >20% of the non-protein-coding genome, assume increasing impor-tance, with accumulating evidence of involvement in dis- ease mechanisms. A comprehensive non-redundant gene- centric view of human ncRNA genes and their annotationsis critical for understanding their involvement in health and disease, and for whole genome sequencing (WGS) inter- pretation. GeneCards, the widely used human gene data-base, is integrating data of ncRNA records and annotations from EBI 's RNAcentral, and its 15 primary sources, as well as from Ensembl, NCBI Entrez Gene and HGNC. ManyncRNA sources are transcript-centric, and for WGS variant analysis it is essential to transform this information into a unique and all-encompassing compendium of ncRNAgenes. Utilizing the capacities of GeneCards, being gene- centric, we clustered overlapping transcript entries from all sources using an algorithm based on genomic coordinates.This strategy eliminates redundancies and allows for full coverage of genomic gene positions. Adhering toGeneCards strategy, each RNA gene, with af liated tran- scripts, appears with annotations from all relevant sources. The uni ed compilation includes more than 200,000 ncRNA gene entries, including ~100,000 Piwi-interacting- RNAs.VarElect, GeneCards interpretation of variantsmapped to ncRNAs by two routes.

School, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom,3Cancer Research Division, Cancer Council NSW, Sydney, Australia,4Department of Oncology & Metabolism, The University of Shef eld, Shefeld, United Kingdom Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease. To promote the development of ef cient therapy approa- ches, it is rst necessary to unravel the genomic architecture of OA. We investigated DNA methylation in cartilage and synovium tissue from 97 patients, the largest epigenetic dataset for knee OA to date. Genome-wide DNA methylation data from primary chondrocytes from macroscopically intact (low-grade) and degraded (high-grade) cartilage aswell as synovium samples were generated from patients that underwent total knee replacement for OA. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identifymethylation marks of cartilage degeneration. Genotype- dependent methylation changes (mQTL effects) were identi ed in synovium, low-grade high-grade cartilage across the genome.

Therefore, it is urgent to translate insights from genomics into diseasemechanisms. We molecularly endotype joint tissues from 200 patients undergoing total knee replacement. We generated RNA-seq data from patient knee tissues (primary chondrocytes from low-grade and high-grade cartilage, synoviocytes, and adipocytes) and genotype data from peripheral blood. We: (1) investigate gene expressiondifferences between low and high-grade cartilage (2) examine alterations in chondrocyte population markers and (3) determine expression quantitative loci (eQTL)effects in all the aforementioned tissues. Differential expression analysis ed 4,512 and 4,365 signi cantly upregulated and downregulated genes in high-grade cartilage respectively. Strong effects were observed for genes associated with osteoarthritis pathology including CRLF1 (P=1.54e 86 ,LFC > 2) and CHRDL2 , (P=9.19e64 ,LFC < -2). Functional analyses pointed skeletal systemdevelopment (P =3.49e06), ossi P=1.48e05) (P=4.14e06). We detected signi cant downregulation in the expression of effector chondrocytes markers in high- grade cartilage, a chondrocyte population associated with high metabolic activity in early-stage osteoarthritis. TheeQTL analysis revealed widespread signi cant associations between genetic variants and gene expression in all tissues. We have identi ed large-scale transcriptional signatures of disease grade in key tissues of the knee joint in the largest osteoarthritis transcriptomic analysis to date.

Jackson ThermoFisher Scienti c, South San Francisco, CA, United States Introduction: Methylation at carbon 5 in the cytosine (5- meC) of the CpG dinucleotide is a key epigenetic regulator of developmental processes in higher eukaryotes. NGS analysis of DNA methylation associated with cancer andother pathologies revealed speci c loci where CpG methylation in fluences the cell physiology. These dis- coveries can be expanded by analyzing discrete methylationchanges in the large number of archived samples. However, retrospective studies using the rich resource of FFPE sam- ples are hampered by the degraded nature of DNAextracted. Materials methods and Results: We present a work flow for DNA methylation analysis method that is compatiblewith FFPE tissues. We demonstrate the use of a method for bisulte sequencing, termed the MethylSeq Direct work- flow, reagents of the Applied Biosystems BigDyeDirect Cycle Sequencing Kit to determine the methylation status in the p16 and MGMT gene promoters as examples.

Peanut oral immu- notherapy (OIT) can successfully desensitise many peanut-allergic children. Although such treatment appears effective and safe for the majority of patients, life-threatening allergic reactions can still occur in a minority of children. Therefore,predictors of positive OIT response are still required. Blood samples were collected at baseline from 38 peanut-allergic children who successfully completed an OIT trial. Methy-lation and RNA sequencing data was obtained from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following in vitro cultivation both in medium and peanut antigenstimulation conditions over 48 hours. We conducted DNA methylome- and transcriptome-wide pro ling of both positive response to treatment and complete desensitisation,accurately phenotyped by an oral food challenge before and after the OIT trial. We developed a random forest classi er using PBMC A few differentially methylated CpGs identi ed were associated with gene expression levels of signi cant DEGs. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed many pathwaysenriched by DEGs. Our random forest classi er showed accuracies of over 70% and 90% in distinguishing positive treatment responders from non-responders and completely desensitised from non-completely desensitised children, respectively. Our results identify potential biomarkers of positive peanut OIT response.

The synthetic analogue of melanocortin (MEHFPGP, Semax) effectively improves cognitive function under acutestress (AS). The work is devoted to the genome-wide expression pro ling in the rat hippocampus under the action of Semax after AS. Materials and Methods: rat model of AS, high- throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), RT- PCR, bioinformatics. with cut-off>1.5 and padj<0.05 at 4.5h after AS. Semax administration of 100 g/kg at 30 min before AS, led to 944 DEGs at 4.5h after AS. Bioinforma- ticaly, DEGs after AS were associated with a wide range of catalytic and binding molecular functions of proteinsencoding by them. Simultaneously, Semax signi cantly modulated and has the effect of compensating for the effects of AS. Moreover, Semax has an additional effect on protein metabolism, increasing the activity of genes involved in protein synthesis ( Rpl15 ,Rps16 ,Rps27l ) and decreasing the activity of genes involved in protein degradation ( Gba,Cln5 ,Ctsh).Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 753Conclusions: The data obtained revealed the anti- inflammatory and immunomodulatory transcriptional effects of the melanocortin analog Semax after AS. We believe that further genome-wide non-coding RNAs pro l- ing can reveal novel insight to the peptide regulation in rat brain after AS.

P20.61.A Association between prenatal stress and DNA methylation R. 1,2, CHDD, of Washington, Seattle, WA, Seattle, WA, United States Introduction: Maternal stress before and during pregnancy can profoundly affect the in-utero and postnatal childdevelopment. We hypothesize that children affected by prenatal stress and thus epigenetic reprogramming might show alterations of the fetal autonomic nervous system andHypothalamic- Pituitary axis. Methods: We evaluated epigenome-wide methylation sites in the saliva of infants born to stressed and non-stressed mothers. In a prospective study of expecting mothers, we screened women for chronic stress exposure at the 28 thweek using the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Prenatal Distress questionnaires (PDQ). Expectant mothers were classi ed into the stressed group (SG, PSS- 1019,N=55); the control group (CG, PSS-10 < 19, N=55) matched 1:1 for parity, maternal age and gestational age. On the day of delivery, maternal blood and maternal head hair were collected for cortisol measure-ments. DNA methylation was measured in saliva samples of the newborn using the EPIC Bead Chip array (758132 CpG). In order to identify associations between cortisol andmethylation, linear regression models adjusting for con- founders (sex, age and smoking) were run.Results: Cortisol measurements were 63% higher in SG versus CG. The top hit of the regression analysis is cg15652683 (p =2.16e-06), a CpG annotated to VIPR2 gene that function as neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine hormones. Conclusions: Our work is ongoing and aims to see if the prenatal stress can be employed as a predictive biomarker of child neurodevelopmental outcome. R. Sharma: None. C. Zelgert: None. P.

Alone National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, Khurda, India Introduction: Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) is a systemic age- related disorder of protein aggregation with prominent ocular manifestation. The etiology of PEX is multifactorialinvolving both genetic and epigenetic factors. This study aims to understand the genetic and epigenetic regulation of molecular chaperones, clusterin (CLU) and heat shockprotein 70 (HSP70), respectively, in PEX pathology. Materials and Methods: based capillary electrophoresis was employed for genotyping variants inCLU in an Indian cohort comprising of 136 PEX patients and 89 controls. mRNA and proteins levels were checked through qRT-PCR and western blotting. DNA methylationof HSP70 was assessed through bisul te sequencing. Functional and molecular analysis were done by reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electro-phoretic mobility shift and human lens epithelial (HLE-B3) cells. Results: We found deregulated expression of CLU and HSP70 in the lens capsule of PEX affected individuals. Two variants in CLU , rs2279590 and rs3087554 showed a signicant association with PEX as risk factors. Further, rs2279590 was found to be a functional variant that regulates CLU expression through interaction with HSF1. Further, bisul te sequencing revealed DNA hypermethyla- tion of HSP70 in PEX patients leading to its transcriptional silencing which was further validated by its restoration by DNA methyltransferase inhibitor in HLE-B3 cells. Conclusions: This study shows that the molecular chaperones are deregulated in PEX affected individuals,754 J. del Picchiacontributing to the severity of the disease. CLU and HSP70 expression is regulated through different mechanisms, i.e., genetic and epigenetic, implying a complex interlink between genetic and environmental effects in PEX pathophysiology. R.S.

Bailo1, Italy,5Department of Women 's and Children 's Health and Service for Sexual and Domestic Violence (SVSeD), Fondazione IRCCS Ca 'Granda Ospe- dale Maggiore Policlinico,, Milan, Italy,6Italian National Institute of Health, Roma, Italy Introduction: Violence against women represents a chronic and global health plague and, due to its serious con-sequences on women 's health, needs to be approached at multisciplinary level. The short-term effects of violence are more evident, while the exhaustive evaluation of long-termeffects still remains a challenge. It has been demonstrated that the signs ofviolence interfere with genome plasticity and gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. Materials and Methods: Cases were enrolled by systematic sampling of victims of violence screened at the Emergency Department in all the italian regions. Thepsychological evaluation was performed in a cohort of 700 women. Biological samples from women 's victims were analysed for differential methylation in a panel of genesinvolved in post traumatic stress disorder. Results: Quantitative methylation evaluation of a panel of genes already reported as associated with trauma/stress-related disorders was performed by MassARRAY (Agena, Bioscience) in 63 victims and 80 controls. The evaluation of LINE1 methylation, for global methylation assessment is inprogress, (pyrosquencing, Qiagen). Conclusions: Early detection of post-traumatic stress disorder cases represent a priority area of research, which isfocused not only on the susceptibility but also on the resilience or not resilience to PTSD. The interactionbetween genome and environmental factors, such as violence, represents one of the major challenges in precision and preventive medicine. By knowing the mechanisms responsible for resilience, we can derive clues about the best treatment and the best public policy. A. Piccinini: None. P. Bailo: None. M. Miozzo: None. S. Tabano: A. S.F.

Lee Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Introduction: Ribosomal protein is the essential compo- nent of ribosome which is a molecular machinery to translate the genetic information from the mRNA templates into proteins. Their expression dysregulation is known to beinvolved in the survival and growth of human cells, and pathogenesis of human disease such as cancer. Never- theless, little is known for how genetic factor regulated theirgene expression across expression stage from mRNA tran- scription to translation. Material and Methods: We analyzed the genetic associations of the expression level at three different type expression stages of 27 small ribosomal proteins and 43 large ribosomal proteins using mixed model. Results: Eighteen quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found out for protein abundance of 21 ribosomal proteins, but not for the expression level for mRNA transcript andribosomal occupancy of their corresponding genes. Among these QTLs, three pQTL were associated with three different long non-coding RNA expression, which targetgenes may produce ribosomal components or may control the metabolic cues for ribosome synthesis, which are involved in apoptosis, cell division, and cancer. Conclusions: The results implied that the variants could be identi ed through the different translation of target gene by affecting expression level of lncRNA. Further studieswere needed to understand their underlying mechanism for regulating gene expression of the ribosomal proteins.

Paulo, Center Sct Hans, Roskilde, Denmark,4Sirio-Libanes Hospital, Sao Paulo, Brazil,5Barretos Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Brazil, 6Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany,7Dan- ish Colorectal Cancer Center South, Vejle, Denmark Introduction: Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is treated with pre-operative chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and surgery. Patients achieving complete pathological response(pCR, 15% to 30%) present better overall survival and lower rates of recurrence compared to incomplete respon- ders (pIR). Predicting treatment response markers are nee-ded in these cases. Methods: The methylation status of 32 pre-treatment LARC biopsies (pCR =11, pIR =21) and 5 normal (NT) tissues was assessed (In nium_EPIC_platform-Illu- mina). Differentially methylated (DM) probes (false discovery rate | |>0.15) were identi ed using limma . A predictive classi er was developed using the recursive feature elimination method and Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis. The classi er performance was calculated using the leave-one-out cross-validation test (BRB array tools v.4.4.0). The methylation status of these CpGs was evaluated in 77 LARC cases (32 array-dependentand 45 independent) using bisul te-pyrosequencing. Results: The comparison between pCR and pIR revealed 24,428 and 75,398 DM CpGs, respectively. The CpGsexclusively altered in each group (3,470 in pCR vs. NT and 54,440 in pIR vs. NT) were most frequently hypermethy- lated in pCR (44% vs. 18% in DM CpGs in promoter regions (49% vs. 37% in pIR) and CpG islands (66% vs. 36% in pIR). The classi er, based on 3CpGs, could discriminate cases with 100%sensitivity and 90% speci city. Pyrosequencing con rmed the DM diverges from pIR. Three CpGs could predict nCRT response in LARC cases. L. Matos J. None. F.A. Marchi: J. Baumbach: None. S. Aguiar-Jr: None. S.R.

Kircher1,2 1Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 2Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany Machine learning methods are routinely applied in medicine to prioritize and implicate deleterious genetic variants.However, their focus has been on coding sequence. Here, we address regulatory changes, jointly referring to changes in promoter and distal regulatory elements covering ~5-20%of the non-coding genome. Pathogenic regulatory variants still correspond to a minority of known variants and quan- titative readouts are not commonly available. are limited to speci c loci or read- outs of standing variation. While inherently biased and unsuited for machine learning, these datasets provideimportant validation and show that although myriad anno- tations and scores exist, none consistently predicts experi- mental regulatory variant effects. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN), trained on active and non-active regulatory regions from multiple cell-types. We selected open chromatin from publiclyavailable DNase data HepG2, HEK293T, K562, iPSCs) and use a multi-task convolutional network based only on genomic sequence. The multi-task approachprovides critical insights into regulatory mechanisms and our model outperforms others 'in predicting experimental variant effects. This method inherently learns sequencefeatures of epigenetic factors and DNA binders, and enables us to study sequence correlates of chromatin marks and transcription factor binding. Using recent methods for DNNinterpretation, we extract important regulatory mechanisms from our model, identifying motifs of various key players in cell-type speci c transcriptional regulation. We conclude that DNNs have a high potential in predicting regulatory effects and tissue-speci c regulation, a critical step forward in the interpretation of genome-wide variants in commonand rare diseases.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism which impacts gene expression in reaction to genetic, developmental or environmental conditions. Con-ventional epigenome-wide associations studies (EWAS) inquire the relation of phenotypes to the genomic DNA methylation pattern. We performed an EWAS of blood cellDNA from Restless-Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients and age- and sex-matched controls, using the Illumina EPIC (850K) chip. EWAS results were generated by applyingmixed models in two datasets with 1000 and 2000 subjects, respectively, submitted to rigorous quality control and inflation correction, and then combined by meta-analysis. We obtained three genome-wide signi cant methylation sites. The was located within to be promotor asso- ciated, suggesting promotor inactivation and consequent down regulation of MLLT6 expression in RLS patients. Gene products of MLLT6 and other MLL genes act as transcriptional regulators of MEIS1 , a gene highly asso- ciated with RLS. Our study is currently in the replication stage, where we intend to verify our ndings. Because DNA methylation and gene expression are tissue-speci c, we also generate EWAS and other omics results in post-mortem brain tissue samples of 25 RLS patients and 15 controlsacross four different brain regions. We thus aim for a comprehensive understanding of RLS pathogenesis and potential entry points for therapy. Acknowledgments: International EU-RLS-GENE ConsortiumN. Mirza-Schreiber: None. S.

Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain,2Howard Hugues Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States,3Institut de Biomedi- cina de la Universitat de Barcelona (IBUB), Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain Celiac disease (CD) is an in flammatory intestinal disorder that develops in genetically susceptible individuals upon gluten ingestion. Gluten triggers a proin flammatory response but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. CD-associated SNPs map mainly to noncoding regions, and their effects are dif cult to assess. Additionally, post- transcriptional RNA modi cations, including m6A, have been shown to play key roles in different autoimmune diseases. We hypothesize that noncoding CD-associatedSNPs can alter m6A levels in adjacent motifs, affecting different cell processes and increase CD predisposition. SNP rs3087898, on the 5 'UTR of XPO1 gene, is close to an m6A motif. We con rmed methylation in this region, and observed that the RNA carrying the CD-risk allele is more methylated and binds YTHDF1 reader more ef - ciently, promoting higher XPO1 translation. m6A-related machinery KO produced lower gluten stimulations provoked expression and an enhanced XPO1 -YTHDF1 interaction, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we con rmed that the genotype of the associated SNP in fluences XPO1 protein levels in human intestinal biopsy samples. In addi- tion, biopsies from CD patients stimulated gluten METTL3 and YTHDF1 induction. Wedemonstrate SNPs associated to autoimmune diseases can alter m6A levels and contribute to pathogen- esis. This is the rst approach linking gluten with alterations in m6A-related mechanisms. We observe that gluten indu- ces the m6A machinery for an allele-speci c increase ofAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 757m6A levels on the 5 'UTR of XPO1, leading to augmented XPO1 and NFkB activation in patients harboring the risk allele.

Methods: To a flow cytometry-based fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) assay, western blotting, and luciferase reporter assays in nephrogenic HEK293T and hematopoietic HEL cells, respectively. In comparison toRUNX1 wild-type and six known pathogenic RUNX1 variants, we analyzed nine previously reported germline missense VUS. Results: We observed signi cant impairments in our functional assays for all known pathogenic variants. Threeout of nine VUS displayed signi cantly reduced activity resembling known pathogenic variants. For two VUS, there was clear evidence for a signi cant functional impairment, while two other VUS showed slightly reduced functionality, and the remaining two displayed activity comparable to wild-type RUNX1. Conclusions: We have successfully established func- tional assays and proven their clinical applicability in FPDMM families. Our data supports classi cation of three RUNX1 VUS as (likely) pathogenic and two RUNX1 VUS as (likely) benign. For two additional variants, there is clear evidence for their functional relevance, but further inves-tigations are required to prove their pathogenicity and to facilitate conclusive classi cations of the remaining two VUS.

Linnarsson Karolinska institutet, Solna, Sweden Understanding the molecular processes underlying healthy development of the human brain is crucial in the modelling and investigation of neurodevelopmental disorders. While many evolutionarily conserved developmental processes are well studied in mouse models, our understanding of human- specic neurodevelopmental processes is limited. Our lab aims to provide transcriptomic and epigenomic referenceatlases with single-cell resolution. In this ongoing project, we are characterizing chromatin accessibility of cell types in the human brain during early development (5 -13 p.c.w.) using single-cell ATAC-sequencing.So far, we have sequenced a few tens of thousands of cells and will pro le up to one million individual human cells, identifying bothregion- and cell lineage-speci c enhancers as well as enri- ched motifs and gene accessibility. We use a two-step approach to feature identi cation, performing super- and clustering on binned genomic ranges calling and performing Hier- archical Poisson Factorization on more detailed PeakxCelldata to identify lineages and cell types. We have identi ed 29 clusters and 325.484 unique peaks. 115.048 of these758 J. del Picchiapeaks are intergenic and 28.622 of these peaks (25%) don 't align to any known element in the GENCODE GRCh38 reference, indicating the presence of unannotated cell line- age speci c enhancers. To validate the cluster identities and lineages, our scATAC-seq data will be integrated with the scRNA-seq data that has been acquired as part of theHuman Developmental Cell Atlas initiative. This combined resource may serve as a reference for future studies relating to development of the human nervous system. European Union - H2020-SC1-BHC-2018-2020 - BRAINTIME C.C.A. Mannens: None. L.

T-cells play a key role in initiating and/or maintaining the disease and antigen presentation is important in mediating this. Mono-cytes, precursors of antigen presenting cells, are typically characterised by expression of two cell surface proteins (CD14 and CD16). However, recent studies have shownfurther heterogeneity, some associated with RA. Under- standing monocyte heterogeneity is therefore crucial in understanding the mechanisms leading to autoimmunity.We therefore sought to investigate peripheral blood mono- cyte heterogeneity, using single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), from three healthy volunteers and three patients with RA.Overall, we analysed 17,831 pro les and identi ed fourteen clusters. There was a clear separation of classical (CD14 +CD16) and non-classical (CD14CD16+) monocyte sub- (CD14+CD16+) \"natural killer \"(0.38%) identities. Interestingly, we identi ed acluster de ned by expression of the pro-in flammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 ) in both healthy and RA samples (3.62%), which recently has been shown to be expanded in RA synovia. These ndings show that mono- cytes are indeed more diverse than previously indicated, highlighting the power of scRNA-seq to uncover this het-erogeneity. Further work will be required to validate these ndings and functionally de ne a role for this IL-1 monocyte subset. However, the presence of pro-inflammatory monocytes in the blood of healthy indivi- duals would suggest that they are not a feature of RA specically, but may interact with other cell types to influence or cause disease.

We explored DNA methylation status of 28 imprinted DMRs in 31 SoS patients with NSD1 defect and found that hypomethylation of IGF2 -DMR0 and IG- DMR in a substantial of SoS patients.

Llobregat, Spain Introduction: Temple syndrome (TS) is a rare condition caused by an abnormal expression of genes at the imprinted locus 14q32 that harbors a cluster of imprinted genes. The parental origin dependent expression pattern of imprintedgenes is regulated by the sperm-derived imprinting control region, the IG-DMR, that regulates the somatic establish- ment of the MEG3-DMR the asthe maternally methylated MEG8-DMR and DLK1-DMR intervals. Methodology: A female two years old with mild psychomotor retardation and hypotonia presents a 69 kb deletion of DLK1 identi technique was used to determine the inheritance, methylation pattern and dose analysis. Bisulphite PCR and pyrosequencing was used toassess methylation not included in the MS-MLPA assay. Results: The deletion is inherited from her father and from her grandmother, also her uncle is a carrier. The methylation pattern at the IG-DMR and MEG3-DMR was normal in carriers by MS-MLPA. It was con rmed by pyrosequen- cing, which also revealed carriers were hypomethylated at the DLK1 and MEG8-DMRs consistent with maternal transmission, whilst the proband presented with mildhypermethylation at the DLK1-DMR.Conclusions: The loss of expression of DLK1 on the paternal allele is responsible for the clinical features of psychomotor retardation and mild hypotonia suggestive of Temple syndrome. This small deletion narrowed the minimal region and methylation results supports that DLK1 loss of function is suf cient to cause the main features of Temple syndrome. B. Neus: None. D. Monk: None.

Findings obtainedover the last decade that not only promoters but also enhancers are characterized by local transcription have challenged the traditional notion that promoters andenhancers represent distinct classes of regulatory elements. Over half of human promoters are associated with CpG islands (CGIs), relatively CpG-rich stretches of generallyseveral hundred nucleotides that are often associated with housekeeping genes. Only about 6% of transcribed enhan- cers de ned by CAGE-tag analysis are associated with CGIs. Results: Here we present a detailed analysis of the relation between enhancer and promoter characteristics andthe presence or absence of CGIs. We show that transcribed enhancers share a number of CGI-dependent characteristics with promoters, including statistically signi cant local over- representation of core promoter elements. CGI-associated enhancers are longer, display higher directionality of transcription, greater expression, and a lesser degree oftissue speci city, as well as a higher frequency of transcription-factor binding events than enhancers not associated with CGIs. Genes putatively regulated by CGI-associated enhancers are enriched for transcription regulator activity. Conclusions: Our ndings show that CGI-associated enhancers display a series of characteristics related to760 J. del Picchiasequence, expression, and function that distinguish them from transcribed enhancers not associated with CGIs. R. Steinhaus: None. T. with Brest, France Three-dimensional chromatin organization plays a key role on gene expression. Gene regulation depends on cis-reg- ulatory elements which can interact with gene promoter bychromatin loop. Alteration of chromatin architecture and/or cis-acting elements can lead to cis-ruption disorder. Numerous unelucidated nonsyndromic hearing loss anddeafness 1 ( DFNB1) cases carrying out only one hetero- zygous pathogenic mutation on Gap Junction Beta 2 ( GJB2 ) gene, led to strongly suggest the presence of distant cis- regulation. Thanks to chromatin conformation study we previously identi ed several GJB2 cis -regulatory elements and purposed a DFNB1 3D looping model. Now, to more characterize these cis-acting elements, we analysed coop- erative effect of these regions, we combined few regions together and showed that association of two enhancersincreased the enhancer activity. Moreover, we focused on 10 patients with incomplete genotype. We realized a whole genome sequencing with HiSeq 4000 by IntegraGenGenomics. The results are currently being analysed. Our results allow to con rm an enhancer activity of these cis- regulatory regions and their cooperative effects. Then, weexpect that whole genome sequencing will allow to identify other mutations with loss / gain function or CNV which can explain pathology of our patients. A. Le Nabec: None. A.

Conidi1 1Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, exerts multi- ple functions in vivo and uses different mechanisms of action and protein partners for controlling embryonic and adult cell fate decisions and maturation. As shown in var-ious cell type speci c knockout mouse models, some of these mechanisms explain major aspects of human MOWS (OMIM#235730). ZEB2 is located downstream of a ~3,3 Mb-long gene desert, which is evolutionary conserved in other vertebrates. We mapped chromatin conformation changes here over ~7.4 Mb (chr2:143270465-150642631;GRCh37/hg19) to identify regulatory elements (REs) of ZEB2 . Material and Methods: Temporal Targeted Chromatin Capture (T2C) was used in human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) during neural differentiation. Candidate REs, and their co-operations, were characterized by luciferaseassays in transiently transfected cells, including neuropro- genitor enhan- cers ~500kb upstream the ZEB2 transcription start site. They display strongest proximity (in T2C) with the ZEB2 promoter at early NPC/rosette cell stage, where ZEB2 mRNA levels increase signi cantly. Conclusions: This work illustrates the value of T2C in terms of high-resolution mapping novel REs at affordablesequencing cost. We are the rst to document the dynamics of far-distant neural-active REs for ZEB2 located in the upstream gene desert. T2C can thus be used to identify andcharacterize REs that might be affected in those MOWS patients where no ZEB2 protein-encoding mutation could be identi ed. J.C. None. D. Huylebroeck: None. A.

The parent-of-origin expression ofZNF597 is regulated by the ZNF597: TSS-DMR of which only paternal allele acquires methylation during post- implantation period. Overexpression of ZNF597 may con- tribute to some of the phenotypes associated with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 16 (UPD(16)mat), and some UPD(16)mat patients presenting with Silver-Russellsyndrome (SRS) phenotype have recently been reported. Materials and Methods: A 6-year-old boy partially presented with SRS-like features such as prenatal growthrestriction, macrocephaly at birth, forehead protrusion in infancy, and clinodactyly of the right fthnger. Methyla- tion, expression, microsatellite marker, single nucleotidepolymorphism array, whole-exome sequencing analyses conducted. Results: Isolated hypomethylation of the ZNF597: TSS- DMR and subsequent loss of imprinting and overexpression ofZNF597 were con rmed in the patient. Epigenetic alterations such as UPD and other methylation defects wereexcluded. Pathogenic sequence or copy number variants affecting his phenotypes were not identi ed, indicating that primary epimutation occurred postzygotically. Conclusions: This is the rst case of isolated ZNF597 imprinting defect, who showed prenatal growth retardation and some dysmorphic features reminiscent of SRS. ZNF597 overexpression may comprise the underlying molecular mechanism of developing SRS phenotype in UPD(16)mat. Further investigations and case series are needed toestablish a new imprinting disorder entity involving the ZNF597 domain.

Schlegelberger Medical School Hanover, Hannover, Germany We report on an 8-year-old Iranian boy who was diagnosed with CLOVES syndrome, a disease within the PIK3CA - related overgrowth spectrum (PROS )caused by mosaic pathogenic PIK3CA variants, characterized by congenital lipomatous asymmetric and combined vascular mal- formations, epidermal nevi, and spinal anomalies.The patient presented with a large \"portwine\", multiple super cial small hemangiomas, macrodactylia of ngers and toes, syndactylies and swelling on the right breast. Thepatient reported pain in the upper and lower extremities. Motor and cognitive development was age-appropriate. Exome analysis from peripheral blood revealed no patho-genic syndrome due to a postzygotic PIK3CA variants gained in the early embryonic period. We performed parallel panel sequencing (IDTcustom panel) from different tissues. No pathogenic variant was detected in the PIK3CA gene in blood and oral mucosa. In a skin punch (hypertrophic hand) the pathogenic PIK3CA variant c.328_330del p.(Glu110del) was detected with an allele frequency of 4%. A broblast culture of this punch reveled the pathogenic PIK3CA variant with an allele frequency of 44%. There is no curative therapy available. However in a clinical trial with the PIK3CA inhibitor BYL719 (Alpelisib)carried out in 19 patients with CLOVES syndrome improved symptoms. (Venot et al. 2018; PMID: 29899452)).

Patient-speci c induced pluripotent stem-cells production bone marrow stem-cells (BM- MSCs) were tested and evaluated regarding their pro-liferative capacity and stability for potential use for cartilage regeneration. Material and Methods: BM-MSCs cells isolated from the iliac crest of OA patients and normal controls, were reprogrammed to produce iPSCs and derived iMSCs. Reprogramming to generate iPSCs, was done using amodied synthetic mRNA method. Different clones of each undifferentiated iPSC line were tested for their genetic stability, pluripotency, teratoma formation and for theirpatient-speci c origin as previously described. After mesenchymal differentiation and expansion each iPSC- MSC line was examined for speci c MSC markers. CNV detection was done using aCGH. Results: The clinical safety of the produced cells was proven even in higher passages, by analysis of their geneticstability through array-CGH of various clones of iPSCs and iMSCs cells, in comparison to the original MSCs. Conclusions: Array-CGH revealed a chromosomal pattern exhibiting mostly polymorphic CNVs thus proving genetic stability. Some clones acquired CNV deletions after continuous passaging, a phenomenon extensively observedand related to culture adaptation.

P21.7.A Efcient and concise protocol for neural conversion of human broblasts as an autologous cell source for an early cyto-gene therapy of genetic based neurodegen- erative diseases Esfahani2 1Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and Micro- biology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology,Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of, 2Department of Cellular Biotechnology at Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Biotechnology, ACECR, Isfahan, Iran, IslamicRepublic of Introduction: A revolutionary new approach to produce cells is to induce transdifferentiation to make it conven- tional in therapeutic strategies. In this project, we describe a brief cocktail of small molecules including Dorsomorphin(DSM) and Trichostatin A (TSA) to produce safe induced neuroectodermal cells (iNCs). These iNCs can be used for a combinatorial cell-gene therapy strategy to treat or cure ofgenetic-based neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyo- trophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in newborns. Materials and Methods: Human broblast cells were treated with DSM, in presence of TSA and a cocktail of neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial and ciliaryneurotrophic factor, in neural induction medium. On day 6, cells were seeded on culture dishes coated with poly-L- ornithine +Laminin +Fibronectin. Cell characterization was carried out by morphological tracking, gene expression proling of markers including Vimentin, Nestin PCR, immuno fluorescence and flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS in three independent replicate. Comparisons were analyzed by independent-sample t-test and One-Way ANOVA, p < 0.05. Results: This protocol mediated neuroectodermal con- version of human broblasts within 12 days with an average efciency of 24%, promises a fast strategy to produce human iNCs for cyto-gene therapy of nervous system disorders. Conclusions: Our protocol is a safe conversion protocol which shortens path of clinical application of iNCs. Beneting from these important features, it makes itAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 763possible for us to edit genetic mutations of newborns with neural disorders such as ALS with an early cell-gene therapy strategy.

However, some partially misfolded ER- retained proteins may retain some biological activity and are therefore good drug targets. GM1-Gangliosidosis, a lyso-somal storage disorder, is associated with mutations in -galactosidase ( -Gal) pharma-ceutical chaperones that could bind to mutated -Gal in the ER promoting its folding and traf cking to lysosomes.

Using a mouse vEDSmodel, we established an objective read-out system for the assessment of the clinically highly relevant biomechanical integrity of the murine thoracic aorta. By means of ournovel read-out system, we aimed to assess the effects of antihypertensive drugs on the biomechanical integrity of the weakened \u00ae) for 4 weeks. 1.5-mm- long sections of the ascending and descending murine thoracic aorta were mounted on a tissue puller anduniaxially stretched until rupture while recording the tensile force (in mN). Results: The rupture force was signi cantly lower in untreated heterozygous compared to wild-type mice and decreased with increasing distance from the heart for both heterozygotes and wild-types. We showed that celiprololbut neither bisoprolol nor losartan increased the thoracic in heterozygous mice (PMID:31056650 and 31693161). Conclusions: Our novel and objective read-out system is suitable for detecting signi cant differences in the rupture force of the murine thoracic aorta and allows the assessmentof the effect of candidate drugs on the biomechanical integrity of the aorta.

Stefansdottir1, J. J. Jonsson1,2,3,4 1Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Land- spitali National University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland, 2Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Univ. of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland,3Faculty of Medicine, Univ. of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland,4Genetical Committee of the University of Iceland and Landspitali, Reykjavik, Iceland The founder pathogenic variants (PV), BRCA1:c.5074G>A and the BRCA2:c.767_771delCAAAT were for many years thought to be the only BRCA PVs in the Icelandic popu- lation. Of the two, the c.767_771delCAAAT is more pre-valent, with 0.8% carrier rate. Therefore, genetic testing was mostly limited to these two variants. The extensive elec- tronic pedigrees used in genetic counselling in Iceland,show clearly the hereditary breast and ovarian (HBOC) patterns in families, aiding decision on genetic testing. However, in one part of the country, the Westfjords, hardlyany invidual tested postive for either of the founder PVs despite many HBOC families with classic BRCA1 cancer pattern. By sequencing the BRCA genes, the rst patient tested positive for the BRCA1 c.4096 +3A>G in 2010, and in 2014, another one. The two patients were related within 6\u00b0of relatedness. But, the variant had con flicting pathoge- ClinVar, mostly of unknown signi cance. In 2017, a Danish study classi ed the variant as VUS (1), based mainly on one homozygous healthy individual. We soughtinformation from deCode genetics (personal communica- tion), which established 0.2% population frequency and pathogenity, with 16 fold risk of ovarian cancer and 3.5 foldrisk of breast cancer. In 2019, an Icelandic study found their data to accord with the variant being pathogenic (2). Of the 467 tested for this variant, 87 are postive (19%). All posi-tive individuals trace their ancestry to the Westfjords and no other signi cant HBOC PV has been found there. The variant is now routinely tested for, in HBOC families withroots in the Westfjords. V. Stefansdottir: None. J.J. Jonsson: None.

Tripathi1 1South East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Guy 's and St Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, London, United King- dom,2Medics. Academy, London, United Kingdom,3Guy's and St Thomas 'NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Genomic testing in the UK is changing, and cancer clinicians are increasingly utilising genomics toinform treatment, prognosis and future risks. The UK Government has called for improved education in appro- priately ordering and interpreting genomic tests. We aimedto evaluate existing local cancer genomics training to understand training needs and barriers, contributing to the development of a new online platform ( Nucleus ) for future- proof, scalable training. Materials and Methods: Delegates from Guy 's Hospital Cancer Genetics course completed questionnaires aboutcancer genomics education. This evidence contributed to development of Nucleus , an online education platform. User testing of an initial Nucleus module was assessed to determine the utility of a change in delivery of education. Results: Delegates identi ed time (56%) and funding (44%) as barriers to accessing training. Prior to Nucleus development, 55% of delegates felt online training was an acceptable mode for education, though face-to-face was popular (77%). Following implementation, Nucleus user testing was highly positive. Users rated it as relevant to practice (x =4.57/5), with appropriate length (x =4.29/5) and pace (x =4.14/5), and felt it was easy to navigate. Conclusions: Education is a priority for the implementa- tion of new genomic testing services. Face-to-face teaching is valued but barriers and scalability of training for largerclinician groups must be considered. Online training can overcome barriers by providing instant access to relevant and appropriate education, as demonstrated by Nucleus . Future work will develop further modules and blended- learning approaches to education. A.E. Coulson: None. E. Cox: None. J. Malawana: None. Z. Beydoun: None. V. Reeve: None. A. Kulkarni: None. V.

P22.07.A Governance of Cancer Genetic Counseling: A Systema- tic Literature ReviewAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters Hussain Center, Amman, JordanCancer Genetic Counselling (CGC) involves trained per- sons to help individuals or family members comprehendinggenetic disorders, heredity and risk factors, with the aim to choose the appropriate course of action in the affected family members. This research is aimed at informing (usingthe systematic literature review method) the existence and effectiveness of automated CGC governance frameworks. The gap in the literature revealed the absence of a for-malised approach to linking CGC processes which are currently highly dependent on the person involved in counseling sessions. Although professional guidelines areused to identify patients at risk, they are not in a standar- dised form. Few resources exist in CGC service assessment which are mainly the National Cancer Institute CommunityCancer Centers (NCCCP) and the CGC Assessment Tool (CGCAT) tool. Also, four core bodies are mainly respon- sible for generating policies for CGC services with no majordifferences between their policy documents. CGC Quality requirements include accountability, value, safety, equity, sustainability, effectiveness, etc. Seven core CGC processesare mainly followed from patient identi cation to post- counseling. However, there is no consensus on metrics to inform the satisfaction of quality requirements of CGCprogrammes. Moreover, no comprehensive CGC frame- works exit that re flect the interaction between standards, quality requirements, policies, and processes. In conclusion,without such interactions, automatic governance for each CGC case is not possible which has led the researchers to embark on developing a CGC process architectural frame-work to inform governance of CGC processes, and their effectiveness in reducing incidence and mortality in relation to hereditary.

Hayward2 1Hull Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull, United dom,2Yorkshire Regional Genetics Service, Leeds, United Kingdom Background: Genomics services are advancing rapidly. Development of these services must allow for effectiveinformation dissemination to, and communication with, primary care.Methods: We developed an e-survey to assess Clinical Commissioning Groups '(CCGs) mechanisms of informa- tion dissemination and General Practitioners '(GPs) access to specialist advice. All 17 local CCGs were invited to participate. A semi-structured interview script was devel- oped for face-to-face interviews. Results: 82% of surveys were completed. CCGs disseminated information to GPs mostly by emails to practice managers (100%) and GPs (93%), educationalevents (86%), and CCG newsletters (86%). Overall, educational events were identi ed as the most effective and emails to GPs relatively ineffective. The most commonmethods for GPs to access specialist advice were phone (79%) and electronic 'advice and guidance '(A&G) systems (79%). Phone and electronic advice were the preferredoptions for a new genetics advice service. Three respondents consented to interview. All felt that short, practical updates on genetics (rather than a fulldedicated session) would be useful at their educational events. All had website portals for referral information, on which they felt genetics content would be useful. Simpleupdates could also be emailed to CCGs for dissemination via newsletter. Electronic A&G was the favoured specialist advice method. Conclusions: Short, practical educational sessions could be used to share genetics updates. Simple updates could be emailed to CCGs (for inclusion in newsletters/emails topractice managers) or uploaded onto CCG portals. Electro- nic advice methods, such as A&G and email, should be considered in genomic medicine service development. J. Gordon: None. J. Adlard: None. R. Jewell: None. J. Hayward: None.

The clinical sig-nicance of array-CGH results is not always understood, introducing uncertainties for interpretation and challenges for clinicians and patients. The aim of this study was to lookat the experiences of paediatricians in providing uncertain array-CGH results to their patients; ascertaining their766 J. del Picchiacondence in interpretation and communication of uncer- tain information and reviewing the current support in place. An online mix-methods questionnaire was used to capture the data. Descriptive statistical and thematic qualitative analysis was carried out on the data. Ten paediatricians across three hospitals took part. All paediatricians hadvaried experience in communicating uncertain array-CGH results and a mixed knowledge of genomic testing and its possible implications for the patient and their family. Thisstudy demonstrated a general understanding of array-CGH results and their implications alongside a willingness to communicate uncertainty to patients. The importance ofongoing education and support for paediatricians was highlighted, along with the need for additional patient information. These ndings are important as genomics becomes embedded throughout clinical practice; gaining insight into experiences of those on the frontline helps to improve the support for clinicians and patients alike toensure high quality patient care.

Bishop2 1University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom,2Health Education England Genomics Education Programme, Birmingham, UnitedKingdom Building on current medical practice, genomic medicine highlights unique considerations with regards to consent including addressing needs of the wider family, the com- plexity and uncertainty of genomic information, data shar-ing protocols, and returning results. England is implementing a national Genomic Medicine Service, lead- ing to genomic testing being utilised across an increasingnumber of specialties and resulting in a requirement for workforce development around the consent conversation. In response to this, The Genomics Education Programme hasdeveloped a nationally agreed cross-professional compe- tency framework outlining the knowledge, skills and behaviours required to facilitate genomic testing. Using theprinciples of the nominal group technique, a one-day expert consensus meeting reviewed clinical scenarios in iterative rounds, mapped themes to an initial framework and votedon areas of inconsistency. A revised framework was open for consultation with key stakeholders including patient communities and Royal Medical Colleges before beingnalised. A short-term external evaluation has been con- ducted, assessing how early adopters are using or intendingto use the framework. Evidence-based competencies are an important basis to support responsible delivery of genomic medicine. This framework can be used as a guide for best practice by clinicians involved in requesting genomic tests. For those delivering education, the framework provides a foundation to identify learning needs and structure training,such that consent conversations can be delivered in a con- sistent manner across specialties. In addition, these com- petencies can be used as a reference to evaluate howconsent is facilitated in different specialty areas to enhance the delivery of genomic medicine. A. Pichini: None. A.

Clarke Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff, United King- dom Certain tests are offered to patients in the expectation that the results of the test will be of more use to the patient thanto clinicians managing their care. In genetics, the paradig- matic example is the predictive genetic test for Huntington 's Disease where patients may want to plan for a future with orwithout the disease. Similarly, genetic testing for BRCA 1/2 and some other familial cancers may be offered to patients before they may want to engage in surveillance or pre-ventative treatment. Following established guidelines, counseling for these investigations proceeds by rst providing patients with information about the test while counseling on the aspects of the test that the patient might want to consider. This is to prompt re flection by the patient, before proceeding with the test. The question we raise is: to what extent do patients use this time to deliberate on the decision to take the test. To explore the deliberations of patients, we gathered ethnographic observations of clinic consultations and post decision interviews with patients, and asked patients to keep a record of their thoughts during this period. In this paper,we explore the extent to which patients engage in deliberation by focusing on the patient 's record of their reflections and deliberations. In our analysis, we explore how the temporal span of the patients 'own deliberations extended beyond that of the clinical setting, and how various aspects of the decision could prompt a more or lessdeliberative engagement on the part of the patient.

Our objective is to determine if eConsult is an effective method to improve delivery ofclinical genetics in primary care. Speci cally, the percep- tions of PCPs and geneticists about the effectiveness of genetics eConsults and their implementation into practiceare examined. Materials and Methods: A mixed methods implementa- tion study using data collection forms and interviews wasundertaken with PCPs and 7 geneticists in 2 regions of Ontario, Canada. PCPs complete a questionnaire evaluating value and utility of each eConsult. Geneticists track the typeand appropriateness of eConsults. Descriptive thematicanalysis was used for the semi-structured interviews with geneticists. Results: In 2019, 112 genetics eConsults were analyzed (94 adult, 18 pediatric). Cancer eConsults were most common (56, 50%), with possible genetic syndromes (9, 8%) being next most common. Geneticists did not expectPCPs to know the answer for 46% (52) of eConsult questions posed. Interview ndings at 3 months show that geneticists are positive about eConsult and see value ineducating PCPs through eConsults, but challenges include underuse of the service by PCPs. Conclusions: Geneticist data without PCPs 'assessment of utility of eConsults are presented. Results show that hereditary cancer eConsults are common, PCPs appear to be asking appropriate questions, and geneticists are generallypositive about eConsult.

This emerging issue led to pub-lications on the need for higher education for genetic counsellors in Sweden, and discussions with several Uni- versities regarding this possibility. Subsequently, a processof creating the rst MSc in Genetic counselling in Sweden that ful ls the eligibility criteria for EBMG certi cation (European Board of Medical Genetics) as genetic counsellorhas been started at the University of Link\u00f6ping. Multi- disciplinary workshops, discussions with the EBMG-board, compiling research and higher educational programs forgenetic counselling have resulted in a preliminary curricula adapted to the Swedish context. A 2-year MSc in Genetic counselling (120 ECTS) with rst student admissions in the fall 2021 is proposed. The responses from stakeholders at the University of Link\u00f6ping and the clinical genetics768 J. del Picchiacommunity in Sweden have been positive. The proposed MSc in genetic counselling programme will allow graduates from Sweden to apply for EBMG professional registration and lead to strengthening the role and competences of genetic counsellors as a pivotal member of multidisciplinary teams regarding genetic disorders and support to families inSwedish health care.

Lowndes OUH, Oxford, United Kingdom With the approaching completion of the 100,000 Genomes Project and the recon guration of genetic laboratories, Clinical Genetic Services have been instrumental in rolling out Whole Exome/Genome Sequencing for Rare Diseasesto mainstream clinical services. In April 2019, we began planning, assigning priorities and contacting then meeting individual lead clinicians and contributors to 100,000Genomes Project. We held teaching sessions for clinical teams, taught at regional speciality meetings and hosted meetings for regional early adopters. Subjects includedtesting techniques, use of the National Genomic Test Directory, Record of Discussion, test request forms, NGIS and giving genomic results. Teams of educators comprisedclinical scientists, SpRs, genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists, reaching out to peripheral hospitals and spe- cialist colleagues. Mainstream clinical teams were encour-aged to identify 'Genomic Champions and Practitioners 'to educate their teams and work together in networks. We used tools including role-play, interactive discussions, recordingfrequently-asked-questions and development of slide-decks to ensure consistency and avoid duplication of effort. We worked with Genomic Champions to develop care-path-ways, using a 'Do Once and Share 'model. We worked with colleagues in Wessex and Birmingham to share good practice and Health Education England developing docu-ments and competency frameworks. By December 2019 we had started rapid Whole Exome Sequencing for NICU/ PICU, made ready services in Phase 1 of the WGS roll-outand are readying those in Phase 2. The Oxford Genomic Medicine Centre and Genetic Laboratories embedded all this engagement, education and support in Genomic Aca-demies, over-arching, virtual structures that received wide- spread support from mainstream clinicians.H.

This is therst randomised clinical trial to evaluate the ef cacy of GC for fCRC. Method: We included individuals affected or at risk for fCRC (Lynch syndrome, APC-associated polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis or clinically de ned fCRC). Participants are randomised to (1) genetic counselling and standard care or (2) standard care alone (control). Measures include: Genetic Counselling Outcome Scale (GCOS),knowledge, risk perception, emotional distress, screening/ surveillance behaviours, perceived social support, decisio- nal con flict and quality of life. Results: We currently recruited 24 participants with an average age of 42 years old, 80% females, 40% at risk and 60% individuals diagnosed various types of fCRC cancer.Non-parametric Mann-Whitney-U Test was used to com- pare differences at post-test between the two groups: delta change for GCOS ( p=0.06), level of knowledge (p=0.03) and trust in knowledge ( p=0.01) are indicative of improvement. Additionally, Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank Test was used to compare pre-post scores for the geneticcounselling group: GCOS ( p=0.04), level knowledge ( p=0.07), anxiety flict (p=0.11). Conclusions: Our initial data improvement for the primary endpoint (GCOS) and secondary endpoints(knowledge, emotional distress, screening intention, and decisional con flict). We hypothesize that these trends will be maintained and our ndings will be further supported by the sample ( n=68) we intend to recruit in order to ensure power for statistical and clinical signi cance.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 769A.

Slottje Amsterdam UMC, location VUMC, Amsterdam, Nether- lands Introduction: In the Netherlands in 2013 the national Familial Hypercholesterolaemia screening programme ended. While general practitioners (GPs) were alwaysinvolved in nding index cases, after 2013 especially follow-up and active cascade screening was no longer systematically pursued by an organization. The number offamily screenings dropped. Aim of this study was to explore views on the role of GPs in FH screening and care, and identify barriers and facilitators for optimizing care. Materials and Methods: Two focus groups (17 GPs) and eight interviews (GPs, vascular specialists, a clinical geneticist, health law expert and consultants of the DutchExpertise Centre for Inheritance Testing of Cardiovascular Disease (LEEFH) coordinating FH screening) were con- ducted. Descriptive analyses of data from anonymizedelectronic medical records of 26988 patients registered in 50 general practices in Amsterdam, the Netherlands addressed registration of International Classi cation of Primary Care (ICPC-1) codes and free text. Results: Registration using ICPC code T93.04 (having FH) was suboptimal and varied between practices. GPs hadspecic knowledge gaps. Although GPs acknowledged their role in discussing with patients the relevance of informing rst degree relatives, active support and checking whether patients actually had informed the family was welcomed by some stakeholders, but regarded unfeasible by several GPs. Conclusions: For optimising FH care more adequate information should be available for GPs, patients and family. Knowledge of GPs should be increased. Attunement between primary and secondary care and LEEFH should bestrengthened. Adequate registration in primary care should be stimulated. Funded via APH research institute Innovation grant.D.A.

Sage2 1Fertility United Kingdom,2CARE Fertility UK, Nottingham, United Kingdom Aim: To gain understanding of the implications for patients and regional genetic services after receiving noti cation of a genetic condition associated with a donor used for assisted conception treatment. Methods: This study reports on the experience across 2 private assisted conception centres between January 2018 - January 2020 for alerts issued by donor banks. Theconditions reported were reviewed and considered in the context of the patients 'current assisted conception situation. The implications for patients using the speci c donor were categorised to look for common referral pathways and how and if these can be met by local genetic services. Conclusion and recommendations: Potential referrals to genetic services could arise for patients who: have had a live birth, have embryos in storage or have donor samples in storage for future/sibling use. Alternatively access togenetic counselling services could be provided by the fertility clinic to reduce the impact on local and regional genetic services. Patients should be supported by bothgenetic services and their fertility clinic when receiving genetic information about a donor so they can make empowered and informed decisions about their next steps.Clear pathways of communication between the fertility clinic and genetic services are required to provide a streamlined patient service when a donor is retrospectivelyfound to have or be at increased risk of passing on a genetic condition.

As the770 J. del Picchiause and storage of family genetic information in the GIS impacts clinicians, patients and carers, the aim of this study was to explore their views about this database. Materials and Methods: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with genetic counsellors experi- enced with the GIS. Findings from these interviews wereused to inform focus groups with past patients/carers from public clinical genetics services. Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed usingthematic analysis. Results: Clinicians ( n=12) perceived that sharing of information via the GIS was valuable, although theyidenti ed challenges in achieving consistent data entry, keeping data current and aligned with other health systems, and they raised concerns regarding future challenges.Patients and carers ( n=14) also supported the sharing of family genetic information; but were cautious about the use of information for relatives 'healthcare; and the stewardship of family information. Overall, the majority of participants identi ed similar advantages and privacy concerns regard- ing the sharing of family genetic information and wantedpatients/carers to be better informed about the GIS early in the genetic counselling process - especially about privacy of family genetic information. Discussion: We hope these ndings may inform further development of the GIS; leading to increased patient/carer knowledge through education and development of patientresources. C. Speechly: None. R.

P22.23.B Adopting a gene through Human Disease Genes website series facilitates a clinical diagnosis for rare genetic disorders A. J. M. Dingemans 1, D. E. Stremmelaar1, A. Remortele1,J . de Vries1 1Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Netherlands,2University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, United States, 3University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia The Human Disease Genes website series (HDG) is an international library of websites for professional informa- tion on the clinical consequences of genome ( https://humandiseasegenes.com/ ). The HDG is an initiative of the Human Genetics Department of the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, incollaboration with the University of Washington and the University of Adelaide. Each gene website is moderated bya dedicated team of clinicians and molecular biologists, and provides up-to-date - mostly unpublished - clinical infor- mation on one speci c gene or copy number variant. HDG aims to ll the gap between rst publication of several cases and consecutive publication of a large review paper. Pro- fessionals can use the information of the disorder for geneticcounseling and will have the opportunity to share clinical data. Patients and parents/caregivers will nd useful infor- mation on the disease and have the opportunity to sharedetailed clinical information through the website of our partner GenIDA. HDG is also a platform where researchers can collect and share (functional) data. Recently a newversion of the websites has been launched which not only allows collection of phenotypic data using HPO, but pro- vides an up-to-date graphical overview of the clinical datathat have been collected. These tools will be highly valuable for the clinical practice. Currently, over 400 genes have been adopted by more than 300 moderators world-wide. Ifyou wish to adopt a gene and join the team of moderators please, contact us at the poster or via e-mail: info@hu- mandiseasegenes.com. A.J.M. Vries: None.

Rudnik- Sch\u00f6neborn1, for Human Genetics, Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria,2Center for Medical Education, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom Different to most European countries, the genetic counsel- ling profession has yet to be established in Germany, Austria and German-speaking Switzerland. In 2019 aMasters level course was established in Genetic and Genomic Counselling at the Medical University Innsbruck, Austria, the rst in a German speaking country. The pri- mary aim of this research study was to help the course director, who is also the rst author, explore the perspec- tives of key stakeholders in Austrian genetic servicesregarding prerequisites, opportunities and challenges of implementing MSc trained genetic counsellors in Austria. A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions and thematic analysis was performed. The nine participants were medical geneticists at different hierarchy levels, policy makers at universities,and members of professional committees. Participants were recruited from human genetics departments and universitiesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 771in three geographic regions of Austria, to elicit their opinions and attitudes on the subject. Emerging factors for the successful integration of the newly educated genetic counsellors into the Austrian healthcare system are: Acceptance by medical geneticists, awareness of the genetic counselling profession amongst themedical community, a solid legal basis for the profession, and a precise de nition of their professional role within the medical genetic services. This study provides evidence to better understand catalysts and obstacles of the implementation of genetic counselling education and profession in Austria. It outlinesthe challenges of introducing this new healthcare profession in the German-speaking healthcare systems. G.F. Schwaninger: None. C.M. Benjamin: None. S. None. J. None. P22.25.A Demand for genetic counselling services in Germany: past, present and future I. Nippert 1, J. Schmidtke2, Germany Medical geneticists are providing the majority of genetic counselling services in Germany. With the Act on Genetic Testing (GenDG) the German legislator has issued far reaching regulations for genetic services,including genetic counselling. Objectives: To assess demand for genetic counselling services before and after the enactment of GenDG. Material and Methods: Data on genetic counselling services (2005-2017)provided within the framework of the German statutory health insurance (GKV) were obtained viaa database query at the Central Institute of the National Association of Statutory Health Physicians (ZIV-KV) and via regional (state) associations of statutory health physi-cians. Additional data on supply and demand were obtained from the GenBIn database. Results: Demand for genetic counselling has steadily increased at an average rate of 6% per year since 2009. The increase has started well before the enactment of GenDG. Change in demand is characterized by increased self-referrals and by increased referrals by other specialists than obstetricians/gynecologists. Waiting times have increased.Conclusions: Increased demand may be attributed to a multiplicity of factors, such as advances in technology, increased public awareness, increased awareness among nongeneticist physicians and the GenDG. While demand is steadily growing, the number of medical geneticists remains almost constant. Capacity limits may be reached if bothtrends continue.

P22.26.B Mapping counselling supervision at European level M. and Cell Biology, Universidade do Porto; Centre for Predictive and Preventive and Cell Biology, Universidade do Porto; Centre for Predictive and Preventive Genetics Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain Genetic testing is becoming more commonplace in general and specialist health care, and should always be accom- panied by genetic counselling, according to legislation inmany European countries and recommendations by pro- fessional bodies. Personal and professional competence is necessary to be able to provide safe and effective genetic counselling. Clinical and counselling supervision of practitioners plays a key role in quality assurance of practice and providing asafety environment for patients and professionals. However, in many European countries, genetic counsellors are still an emerging professional group and supervision is notroutinely offered. The relevance of counselling supervision for the improvement of genetics healthcare services is not yet widely discussed or established. This study aimed to explore the current status of genetic counseling supervision provision across Europe and to772 J. del Picchiaascertain factors that might be relevant for the successful implementation of counselling supervision. A total of 100 practitioners responded to the online survey; respondents were from 18 countries, with the majority working in France (27%) and Spain (17%). Only 34 participants reported having access to genetic counsel-ling supervision; country of origin, the existence of a regulation system and years of experience were factors identi ed as relevant in fluencing access and characteristics of counselling supervision. Although there is a growing number of genetic counsel- lors trained at European level, just a few countries haveimplemented and required as mandatory the access to genetic counselling supervision, which is essential to ensure a safe and effective genetic counselling.

The process from the initial suspicion to the nal genetic risk assessment in an individual includes several steps, in which affected and unaffected family members have to be taken care of. To demonstrate the psychological impact as well as the inter-action between the physician and the respective family members, we set up a video based online accessible virtual genetic counselling session in a cancer family. A familywith Lynch syndrome was created. Simulation patients were instructed to act as affected and unaffected family members according to prede ned roles. A specialist in human genetics was advised to conduct a counselling session according to a routine situation. Videos were taken from different camera angles and cut according to the counsellingprocess. An e-learning module was developed by using an e-learning course development software (Articulate 360 \u00ae).Each video sequence was limited to 2 minutes duration. The e-learning course was intergrated as a sharable object reference module in an elearning content man- agment system (ILIAS \u00ae).

Yet only few studies investigated the psychological wellbeingand challenges amongst the caregivers of young people diagnosed with psychiatric diagnosis. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from October 2018 to October 2019 in an outpatient pediatric psychiatry clinic. Family members (e.g. parents, grand- parents) of young people diagnosed with psychiatricconditions (e.g. affective disorders, autism spectrum disorders, attention de cit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) were invited to participate.We explored their knowledge about psychiatric disorders, illness perception, burden of care, stigma, wellbeing and quality of life. Results: 70 caregivers (60 females, 10 males, 40.5 \u00b1 8.4 average age) participated in the study. The burden of care is positively associated with caregivers 'knowledge and perceptions of the negative consequences the disorder can have for the patient (r =0.52, p < 0.01) and relativesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 773(r=0.25, p < 0.05) as well as with the personal blame towards the patient (r =0.30, p < 0.01). Both stigma and burden of care were shown to signi cantly impact caregivers 'wellbeing (r =-0.29, p < 0.05; r =-0.42, p < 0.01) and quality of life (r =-0.39, p < 0.01; r =-0.42, p< 0.01). Conclusions: Caregivers experience burden of care, low wellbeing and quality of life and increased levels of stigma. Insight into the impact of psychiatric disorders oncaregivers can help professionals develop and adapt psychosocial interventions for families impacted by psy- chiatric disorders such as psychiatric genetic counselling.

Turbin 1,2 1Addenbrooke 's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Background: Genetic counselling is in a transitional phase. There is a radical shift as genetic testing becomes a routine part of healthcare. With the volume of genetic testingincreasing, and resources stretched, technological solutions have been developed to help people understand the genetic testing they are being offered. These include decision aids,'chatbots 'and online learning materials. In this context, the role of new technology and genetic counsellors remains uncertain. I argue that research isneeded to look at how patients can bene t from both genetic counsellors and new technology in the genomic age. Methods: Six lms were created by the genetic counselling team at Addenbrooke 's Hospital and the Society and Ethics Research Group from Wellcome Genome Campus. The lms use the metaphor of music to communicate genomic information. Six genetic consultations in which the lms were used were observed, and the same patients were interviewed.Ethnographic eld notes from the observations and inter- views were analysed thematically. Results: Themes emerged around technology, shared space, body language, emotion, information giving and personalisation. The qualitative data also allowed for an exploratory analysis into the relationship between technol-ogy and power in genetic counselling consultations. Implications: This research provides insight into the role of technology in genetics; how it can both hinder andenhance genetic counselling practice. I also discuss the results in the context of evidence-based genetic counselling. I argue that even with technological innovations, time is still a key element if patients are to bene t from both new technologies and genetic counselling. I.G. Turbin: None. P22.31.A Survey of the competences of hospital based doctors in providing care to patients with genetic diseases V. Curtisova 1,2, H. Adamov\u00e12 University, Olomouc, Czech Republic Aim: to assess the knowledge and skills related to clinical genetics in a group of Czech hospital non-genetic specia- lists, compare the results with those obtained during an assessment of the international e-learning project Gen-Equip and to see if they correlate with their medical spe- ciality, years from graduation, previous referral of patients for genetic consultation or testing and self-perceivedknowledge of the management of patients with heritable conditions. Methods: the anonymous modi ed two-part question- naire developed by the Gen-Equip project was randomly distributed to physicians of a Czech teaching hospital. Results: scores of the participants ( n=46) were signicantly lower than those in the Gen-Equip group (n=75) - 53.2 vs. 60.5 for part 1 of the test and 48.4 vs 75.3 for part 2 of the test. The scores were signi cantly higher in participants who previously referred patients for genetic consultation (53.8% vs. 43.5%) or for genetic laboratory testing (53.9 % vs. 44.8 %) than those who hadmade no referrals. There was no signi cant dependence of the results of the test and the years from graduation, the specialisation of the participants or their self-perceivedknowledge of the management of patients with heritable conditions. Conclusions: the level of knowledge and skills related to clinical genetics may affect the readiness of physicians to refer their patients for appropriate genetic care. In our sample the knowledge and skills were not in fluenced by the years from graduation, medical speciality or self-perceived knowledge of the management of patients with heritable condition. V.

P22.33.C A new measure for genetic counselling quality ment: Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal,4University Faculty of Medicine, University Coimbra, Portugal,5Clinical testing guidelines recommend appro- priate genetic counselling provision before and after genetictesting is undertaken. In spite of that, literature on quality assessment of genetic counselling is scarce. Measures avail- able are insuf cient, poorly disseminated, and focused mainly on genetic counselling effects. A theoretically-underpinning scale for quality assessment by healthcare professionals was recently published; however, the need for a measure forpatients 'assessment persisted. This study describes the development and initial validation of a theoretically-informed scale for genetic counselling quality assessment by patients.Scale items were developed based on the pre-existing quality assessment scale for professionals, the reciprocal-engagement model of genetic counselling practice, and literature ongenetic counselling patients 'perceptions. Items were re ned through cognitive interviews. Patients from ve Portuguese clinical genetics services ( n=123) completed the scale. Principal component analysis using direct oblimin was con- ducted to establish the initial construct validity of the scale and reduce the number of items. Cronbach 'sa l p h aw a sc a l - culated as a measure of internal reliability. Final scale con- sisted of 51 items scale organised into six dimensions. The scale presented adequate internal reliability. Initial evidence ofconstruct validity was also demonstrated. This scale is the rst theoretically-underpinned measure designed for patient 's assessment of genetic counselling quality. Genetic counsel-ling professionals and researchers can use this scale to identify areas for quality improvement of genetic healthcare services and design interventions. We discuss practical implicationsand clinical utility of this new tool as well as challenges of the validation process at genetic services. M. Carvalho: None. F. Rodrigues: None. J. Saraiva: None. A.

P22.34.A Patients 'knowledge about genetics and genetic testing on the example of neoplasm diagnostics A. Tupaj , O. Dusza, M. Smerdzy ski, M. Malarska Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland Introduction: Commercial genetic tests are getting more and more available. As some of them may don 't have a real diagnostic value, it is important to help patients in choosing the right one. We 've decided to examine peoples 'knowl- edge about genetics and genetic testing by using the example of neoplasm diagnostics. Materials and Methods: We've conducted a survey on a group of 1161 people about their knowledge and opinion about the genetic testing in neoplasm diagnostics. The survey was posted on the Internet, the mean age of our patients was24.84 years old, 80.4% of them were female, 19.6% - male. Results: The early results of our study show that 61.6% of patients would perform a genetic test without a specialistconsultation and that the majority of them would trust in the commercial testing results. At the same time, 48.8% of respondents were unable to give a correct answer to the question about the genetic background of neoplasms. Some respondents were also unable to give an example of a genetic test, mentioning mammography, cytology ormedical ultrasound. Conclusions: Our study clearly shows that patients don 't have suf cient knowledge about genetics but at the same time they perform or would perform a genetic test without a specialist 's consultation. As this may lead to the mis- interpretation of the results, we consider it essential to nd a way to educate patients about diagnostic value of genetic tests. In our further work we want to consider the role of General Practitioners in this process. A. Tupaj: None. O. Dusza: None. M. Smerdzy ski: None. M. Malarska: None.

The University has been able to incorporate ASHG/APHMG Medical School Core Curriculums (1995, 2001, 2013) into an undergraduate medical program. Stu- dents 'Scienti c Debate Club \"FBG - Future Belongs to Genetics \"was established in 1995, which held 25 students ' conferences and events. In 2006 a department of Molecular & Medical Genetics was established in our university fortherst time in Georgia. We have embedded problem-based learning (PBL) within the integrated course, centered on clinical case studies; High quality scienti c and educational literature, including textbooks: Thompson&Thompson Genetics in Medicine (7th and 8th editions) have been translated and published by the department. Several localand international conferences, including \"Genomics and Epigenomics 2017), \"Human Genome and Heath \"(2018, 2019) have been organized by the department and the Georgian Society of Medical Genetics and Epigenetics (GSMGE). In addition, since 2014 we have been running a Georgian DNA DayEssay Contest for Georgian and international students. Our department and GSMGE, in collaboration with ESHG, encourage young scientists to participate in the annualconferences organized by ESHG. In 2014 the research and diagnostic laboratory was founded at the department, where PhD programs, CME courses and educational courses forstudents in genetics, genomics and epigenomics were designed and developed. As a result, nowadays, many medical professionals in Georgia have sound understandingof genetics and can successfully deploy their knowledge in their clinical practice, when needed. E.

Gaff1,2,3, on behalf of the Australian Genomics Workforce & Education Working Group 1Australian Genomics Health Alliance, Parkville, Australia, 2Murdoch Children 's Research Institute, Parkville, Austra- lia,3The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia Even as genomic medicine is implemented globally, there remains a lack of rigorous, national assessments of physicians 'current genomic practice and continuing geno- mic education (CGE) needs. We therefore developed anexpert-reviewed survey based in theory (behavioural change) and empirical qualitative data (McClaren et al., Front Genet 2019). Domains included: personal character- istics (demographics, specialty, years of practice); current genomic medicine practice; perception of how proximal genomic medicine is to practice; preparedness to practicegenomics (competence and con dence); and preferences for future roles and models of care in genomic medicine and for CGE. The survey was deployed nationally through medicalcolleges, societies, hospitals, social media and snowballing in 2019, with 409 analysable responses from physicians across Australia. Respondents represented 30 specialties(majority paediatricians, 20%), from mainly public hospi- tals (70%) in Only 13% of respondents ordered whole exome/genome sequencing testsin their practice, with the main reason for not ordering tests being relevance to practice (39%). A third (32%) referred patients to a clinical genetics service for testing and this waslargely unchanged (34%) when reporting future preferences. Two-thirds of respondents felt genomics will soon impact their practice and, while a third recently completed CGE,only a quarter felt prepared. Respondents lacked con dence in genomic knowledge and ability to explain concepts to patients and incorporate test results in patient management.These data can inform genetic services (re test referral patterns) and support genomic education providers to best meet learner needs and develop a competent, genomic lit-erate workforce.

However, training is very heterogeneous and partitioned with isolated trainees learning highly-speci c expertise areas. There was a need for an international group easily accessible online to connect young human geneticists around the world. We aim to present how this groupoperates and develops. Based on the Facebook social media, we created the \"Young Geneticists Network\" private group in February 2018 ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/ young.geneticist/ ). All people registered on Facebook can request to join the YGN group. Requests are reviewed by administrators. All members can post and share text, photos,and multimedia related to Human Genetics topics with other members who receive noti cations. We present anonymous group insights data obtained until November 2019.Wegathered 529 members from 57 different countries and selected 14 volunteer moderators. The majority of the members were under 34 years old (74.9%) and female(74.6%). Six European countries gathered most of the members (55%): France (108), Italy (71), Romania (30), The Netherlands (28), Portugal (27) and the United King-dom (27). We counted 37 posts with 74 comments and 408 reactions from the community. The YGN is a collaborative group that allows members to share training opportunities(online courses, funding resources,...) and queries related to Human Genetics. We are able to engage a global audience of peers in a very short period. We believe this group willexpand and allow better international collaboration to standardize training and facilitate international large-scale genetics projects. F. Riccardi: None. C.

Watson Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Southampton, United Kingdom Introduction: Nurses represent the largest professional group within the National Health Service (NHS) and are central to the integration of genomics into routine health-care. Cardiac Genetic Nurse (CGN) roles have been developed in recent years to streamline the care for patients and families affected by an inherited cardiac condition. Likemany nurses, CGNs prior exposure to genomics and the implications surrounding inherited conditions is limited. This study aimed to explore the education needs and sup-port required for CGNs to ful l their role.Materials and Methods: CGNs were given the oppor- tunity to express their interest in participating, during an Association of Inherited Cardiac Conditions conference and a British Heart Foundation study day. A purposive sampling approach was adopted to invite CGNs working within various NHS Trusts across the United Kingdom toparticipate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with CGNs ( n=7), which were recorded, transcribed and independently coded by two researchers. Results: Through thematic analysis, it emerged that CGNs have a hybrid role requiring a broad range of skills and, despite some overlap, are distinct from the role of agenetic counsellor. A key theme identi ed was the skills associated with managing the uncertainty of genetic information. The interviews highlighted that effectivelearning requires immersion in the clinical environment and the need for a CGN-speci c competency framework to be developed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the need to de ne the competencies required for the role of a CGN, to standardise practice nationally and ensure that nursing andgenetic counselling resources are applied effectively.

It is considered the second most common cause of intellectual disability (ID), with an incidence of 5:10,000, being prevalent in males. The majority of FXS iscaused by FMR1 mutations. As it is a X-linked disorder, females with premutation (range from 55 to 200 CGG repeats) may present early ovarian failure, while males maypresent tremors and ataxia. On the other hand, individuals with complete mutation (greater than 200 CGG repeats)Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 777could present moderate to severe ID (30% females and 90% males), due to FMR1 silencing. As this disorder presents complex etiology, FXS education documentary had been prepared, containing the main syndrome 's themes: historical data, genetic causes and their phenotypic consequences. Materials and Methods: This documentary is a short lm divided in three episodes, which the rst one will be available on the website http://ucgenetica.sites.unifesp.br/ index.php/pt/ . In this episode, the molecular mechanisms of FXS genetic explain how the symptoms are manifested and their clinical consequences. To promote accessibility, the LIBRAS language and English subtitles were used. Results: This documentary had been presented to 83 undergraduate nursing students. The evaluation revealed that 98% of the students assimilated the FXS geneticcontent. Conclusions: This documentary proved to be an ef cient strategy to disseminate FXS information, using a simple andobjective language. The next step is to assess whether this short lm will have the same applicability, in a playful way, to inform family members, students in public schools, andthe general population. L. Vitro: None.

The aim of this course is to offer students an opportunity toconduct experiments based on molecular genetics to understand the role of genetic analysis in the diagnosis of human diseases. Methods: In this course, third year medical students who have passed molecular biology and medical genetics enrolled. Since October 2019 this course has been runtwice with 21 participants. Course components include basic genetic concepts, current molecular genetics meth- odologies (hands-on labs), and interpretation of results (total20hr.). In addition, the course includes a scienti c paper discussion session and an essay writing task. Laboratoryactivities include DNA extraction, PCR of repetitive elements, gene mutation detection, and Real Time PCR- based DNA pro ling. We used kits and reagents developed for educational purposes, e.g. Crime Scene Investigation Kit (BioRad). Results: Students were motivated and enthusiastic to perform well in the lab; they were able to develop their collaborative skills when working together on inquiry-based lab lessons. Post-course evaluation showed that 75% oflearners agreed or strongly agreed that the course had increased their understanding in the methods of laboratory genetics and the sessions had educational value. Conclusions: Our pilot course is effective in improving the level of genetic knowledge and practical genetic skills among medical students. In addition, using lab activities,students will be inspired and encouraged to participate in biomedical research projects. E. Kvaratskhelia: None. M. Zarandia: None. T. Tkemaladze: None. E.

Caanen1, M. L. Haadsma2, A. M. van Remortele2, A. R. Mensenkamp2, R. J. Blok1,M . van Geel1, E. M. Leter1, W. A. . Ligtenberg2, Hoogerbrugge2 University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Netherlands Introduction: Genetic test results can now be available within 2-3 weeks and are therefore increasingly considered for determining treatment options in breast cancer patients.To facilitate timely test results, we aimed to shift counsel- ling and requests for rapid DNA diagnostics for these patients from clinical geneticists to treating physicians andevaluate this transition towards mainstreaming. Methods: Nine regional hospitals were included from July 2018 onwards. Treating physicians were asked for theirneeds and barriers to participate. DNA diagnostics consisted of gene panel analysis for BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2 and ATM. Results: The website www.DNA rst.nl was developed to provide treating physicians with hands-on information. Barriers included time investment during consultation andperceived incompetence of providing breast cancer screen- ing advice for family members. Up to December 2019, 351 requests for DNA diagnostics were made and 42 pathogenicvariants were found (12%). All patients with a pathogenic variant were subsequently referred to a clinical geneticist.778 J. del Picchia32/42 pathogenic variants were found in patients meeting the Dutch criteria for DNA testing for hereditary breast cancer ( n=271), whereas 10/42 of pathogenic variants were found in patients who did not meet these criteria ( n= 57) or for whom this was unknown ( n=23). Structured evaluation of quality of care and experiences of doctors andpatients is ongoing and results will be available shortly. Conclusions: Mainstreaming of rapid gene panel DNA diagnostics in breast cancer patients appears to be feasible. K.J.A.F. van Kaam: None. B.A.H. Caanen: None. M. L. Remortele: A.R. Mensenkamp: None.

Mainstream-ing programs for BRCA gene testing for epithelial ovarian cancer have been introduced to address this problem. However, the successes and challenges of integratinggenetics into the Australian oncology health system are unknown. Methods: Study invitations were emailed through the heads of departments in oncology, genetics and the Mainstreaming Working Party in Australia. Semi- structured telephone interviews were designed using theConsolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Interviews were transcribed and inductive content analysis was conducted. Results: Twenty-two participants from 8 health organisa- tions participated and the following themes were found: Theme 1: Embracing the shift to mainstream genetic testing: clinical utility of testing, preferences on the mainstreaming process, considerations for future adaptation and a patientcentred process, Theme 2: Role delineation and responsi- bilities for mainstream genetic testing: communication networks, genetics point of contact, role delineation, collaboration. Theme 3: Influencing factors on sustaining mainstreaming: ongoing training needs, resources and funding, real world adaptation, private and public systemcomplexity, champions and engagement. Theme 4: Inter- ventions for mainstreaming: embedded genetic counsellor in oncology, results follow up and tracking system,flowchart of mainstreaming processes. Conclusions: Our ndings identify that participants recognise the need for integration of genetic testing inoncology, but that further adaptation of interventions and processes is essential to sustain a feasible model. An understanding of individual and organisational factors thatinfluence mainstreaming programs will help to prepare for future integration of genetic testing in other cancer types. R. O Shea: None.

Golan3,2 1Human Genetics Institute, Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel,2Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel,3Department of neurology, Lady Davis Carmel Medical Center, Haifa, Israel Background: The advent of molecular genetic technologies paved a path for the diagnosis of many neurological dis-orders. Joint evaluation by a neurologist and a medical genetics specialist can potentially increase diagnostic effectiveness by ensuring the exclusion of non-geneticmimics and by rationally selecting appropriate genetic diagnostic tools. Therefore, a monthly adult Neurogenetics clinic was established. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records. Results: 85 patients were evaluated. Age: 47.1 \u00b1 15.7, Male: 40(47%), 44 (51%) had a positive family history.Disease duration was typically long (11.4 \u00b1 0.9 years). Futile use of expensive diagnostic modalities was very common [45(52%) had repeated MRI, 28(32%) hospitalizedfor observation in neurologic departments, 12(14%) had a workup, 4 (4%) with a non-conclusive muscle biopsy, 1 with a normal cerebral angiography].Following clinical evaluation molecular genetic testing was offered to 70 (82%) patients. In the other 15(18%) routineAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 779workup for the exclusion of non-genetic mimics was not complete, obtainable information regarding family members was missing or that a neurogenetic disorder seemed improbable. 29 (34%) patients received a de nitive diagnosis, either a genetic (29%) or non-genetic (5%). The adherence to genetic testing recommendations was62%. The reasons for non-adherence were lack of public funding for the required test (56%) and patient decision not to proceed (44%). Conclusions: Given the frequent futile use of expensive modalities due to diagnostic uncertainty and the complexity of clinical genomic data analysis, a comprehensive multi-disciplinary neurogenetic clinics seems reimbursement and cost effective for the patients and medical health institutions.

Materials and meth- ods: Totally 800 questionnaires were collected from preg-nant women living in 16 regions of Russia. Results: The statement \"Every pregnant woman must undergo combined screening in the rst trimester \"was agreed by the majority of respondents - 90.16%. 63.38% of the respondents did not know before our survey about NIPT. After explaining its capabilities, 74.74% believe that it should be used. It wasrevealed that despite the high compliance to the early pre- natal screening between pregnant women in general, only a little more than half of the women with an increased risk ofchromosome abnormalities were ready to undergo invasive diagnosis in the fetus and only a quarter of the pregnantwomen were ready to terminate the pregnancy with chro- mosome abnormalities in the fetus. Women who were ready to terminate the pregnancy were statistically signi cantly older, had more pregnancies, were at a later gestational age. It was more important for them to receive the test results as early as possible with as much additional information aspossible and have the state/insurance type of payment for the test (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.002). Conclusion: The sur- vey will allow comparing the results with other countrieswhere NIPT is used in early prenatal screening and to develop recommendations for our country.

Inthis context, the EXOMA study (2016-2019) proposed somatic/constitutional exome for patients with advanced cancer. Considering the risk for identifying genetic predis-position, with genetic counseling and management780 J. del Picchiaimplications, a genetic consultation was proposed; which value needed to be assessed. Methods: A 20 minutes consultation, with a prior collection of family history by the patient, was carried out within 15 days of inclusion in EXOMA. Tumoral and constitutional analyses were limited to 317 genes involvedin oncogenesis. Results: In 36/716 patients (5%), a constitutional pathogenic variant was identi ed in 13 actionable genes, but half were already identi ed in the care circuit. Among 18 cases identi ed by the exome, 10/18 did not meet the predisposition search criteria, and in 2/10, the variation canbe considered as incidental (unrelated to the presented cancer). In 3/18 cases, a genetic consultation had been previously performed, but the analyses were limited toBRCA/MMR . In 5/18 cases, the criteria for the search of predisposition were present but not identi ed by the oncologist. In 18 additional patients, a variant was identi ed in genes that do not lead to a speci c surveillance protocol in France, such as ATM/CHECK2 . Conclusions: In 2.5% of patients, a constitutional genetic predisposition, related or not to the clinical presentation, was identi ed, making it important to inform the patient beforehand. This low percentage should be balanced withthe burden of proposing such urgent circuits. Other modes of information are being explored. G. Bertolone: None. E. Cosset: None. A. Baurand: None. C.

Dillon 1, M. Watson1, J. Austin2, K. McGhee3 1Wessex Clinical Genetics Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UnitedKingdom, 2BC Mental Health Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada,3Bournemouth Univer- sity, Bournemouth, United Kingdom Introduction: Genetic counselling process of sup- porting patients 'and families 'adaption to genetic infor- mation. Psychiatric genetic counseling has been proven to be effective in improving patients 'empowerment, self- efcacy, and knowledge even in the absence of genetic testing. Despite this, only one specialist psychiatric genetic counselling clinic currently exists. In order to engage andempower genetic counsellors in providing psychiatric genetic counselling worldwide, a two-day workshop: \"Psychiatric Genetic Counseling for Genetic Counselors \", was developed and implemented. The aim of the present study was to qualitatively explore the impact of the workshop. Materials and Methods: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with twelve genetic counsellors who attended the workshop between 2015 and 2018. Interviewswere then transcribed, and thematic analysis was used to identify themes from the data. Constant comparative method was employed on the qualitative data themesthroughout analysis. Results: 100% of participants reported an increase in empowerment in offering psychiatric genetic counselling topatients. Participants also re flected how the workshop normalised mental illness and aided the counsellors in identifying sources of their personal stigma. The workshopalso provided participants with a practical tool to describe multifactorial inheritance, the Jar Model. Conclusions: The\"Psychiatric Genetic Counseling for Genetic Counselors \"workshop empowered genetic coun- sellors to feel con dent and comfortable offering psychia- tric genetic counselling to patients.

M. Facio , J. C. Sapp, K. L. Lewis, L. G. Biesecker National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) released its initial guidelines for the return ofsecondary genomic ndings (SF) in 2013. The main reason for returning SF include the opportunity to tailor medical care to the individual and his/her at-risk relatives. Weconducted a systematic review to summarize the published data supporting the communication of SF and downstream actions taken by individual recipients. We searched six major biomedical databases (CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsychInfo) to identify peer-reviewed publications between 01/Jan/2012and 18/Jun/2019 describing how SF ndings are commu- nicated, and/or any outcomes associated with disclosure, including psychosocial impact, healthcare behaviors, familycommunication/cascade testing.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 781A total of 1751 citations were retrieved. After de- duplication, 990 citations were screened and 847 rejected. The remaining 143 citations were reviewed, and 20 met inclusion criteria. Most studies ( n=10) investigated both process and outcomes, and a few of these reported similar rates of compliance with post-disclosure recommendations(~70%); rates of family communication were as high as 90%. Other studies focused on the disclosure process ( n=4) or post-disclosure outcomes ( n=6) only. Across studies the psychosocial impact of receiving SF was minimal. Since the release of the ACMG guidelines, only twenty studies have examined the disclosure process or evaluatedclinical utility. Our review suggests that not all SF recipients communicate results to their doctors or relatives, and a substantial fraction may not engage in therecommended healthcare behaviors. These early published experiences may help shape research priorities as we move towards personalized medicine. F.M. Facio: None. J.C. None. P22.56.B Single-gene pathology in pediatric patients referred for genetic counseling for a period of ve years M. Stoyanova 1,2, L. Angelova1, M. Hachmeriyan1,2,M . Varna, Bulgaria,2Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Uni- versity Hospital Saint Marina, Varna, Bulgaria Introduction: As a whole, the group of single-gene dis- orders is often considered to be primarily affecting child- hood - almost 90% of this pathology is manifested by puberty. Our aim is to evaluate the activity of the GeneticsCounselling Unit in diagnosis of children with clinically suspected monogenic pathology. Materials and methods: The study includes pediatric patients referred to the Genetics Unit of the University Hospital Saint Marina, Varna for a period of ve years (2015-2019), who were genetically consulted for suspectedor con rmed single-gene disorders Clinical phenotyping, imaging examinations, literature review and specialized computer programs/dysmorphology databases were applied.Appropriate molecular genetic and metabolic investigations were offered. Results: 343 out of 706 (48,5%) consulted children, including 94(27,4%) infants, were clinically suspective for single-gene disorders. he great majority - 276(80,5%) were referred by Pediatric clinics of the hospital. Moleculargenetic testing (in Bulgarian Genetic laboratories or abroad) was performed to 212 children(61,8%). In 83% it wasnanced completely privately. Based on these analyses, 105 (49,5%) patients were detected with single-gene conditions, mainly autosomal recessive entities in 83(79%) of them. The spectrum of all genetic diagnoses is presented in details and analyzed. The identi ed genetic defects in some patients led to the detection of carriers in close relativesand prenatal diagnosis. Conclusions: Although individually rare, single gene disorders totally are responsible for a signi cant proportion of childhood pathology. Genetic counseling is an integral part of medical care for patients and their families. Reimbursement of genetic testing by National HealthInsurance Fund would increase detection rate. M.

P22.58.A Completely new set of free educational inheritance quiz apps for students: their use and international uptake . A. P. Tobias 1, E. S. Tobias2 1University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 2University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom Introduction: Undergraduate medical and science students frequently search for self-assessment quizzes to help themlearn the inheritance modes of well-known genetic dis- orders. Addressing this, a new set of quiz apps has recently been created by the authors and released on both app storesfor undergraduate students. These apps are separate from the already-popular Clinical Genomics Guide and Clinical Genomics Quiz apps that the authors previously created forpost-graduates and professionals. Methods: Three new multi-platform, self-contained apps were created using the authors 'Apple & Google developer licences. Each app contains 15 multiple-choice questions, testing knowledge of 'inheritance-modes (auto- somal dominant, recessive, X-linked or mitochondrial). Theapps award points for questions answered correctly at rst attempt. Upon quiz completion, total and percentage scores are displayed and the app teaches students the correctanswers to all incorrectly-answered questions. The apps are compatible with all currently used iPhone (iOS) and Android smartphones and tablets. Results: Having passed strict, extensive testing by Apple and Google, the Genetic Inheritance Quiz A, B and C apps (progressing in dif culty) are available, free, on both ofcial App Stores. They have been installed >750 times worldwide in 4 months. Feedback comments for the apps, rated 5-stars overall, have been highly positive, commend-ing the layout, corrected-answer-list, usability, \"massive \" helpfulness and \"fun\". Links to the apps are provided from782 J. del Picchiathe ESHG Education page and from www.genomicsapps. org. Conclusions: Although time-consuming to create, they have been found useful to many individuals internationally.

Tobias: for brca carriers and their relatives: motivations and satisfaction of participants B. Bertonazzi, L. Godino L. Polpatelli, S. Hospital, Bologna, Italy To assess helpfulness and satisfaction about support or focus groups and psychoeducational interventions in BRCA carriers, plus recurrent themes expressed by participants, we have conducted a systematic review and a prospectiveexplorative cohort study. Peer-reviewed papers published between January 1995 and May 2019 were searched using ve databases. Of 1505 studies identi ed, 27 were reviewed in full-text, 9 met the inclusion criteria. Satisfaction and usefulness of support groups was analyzed by three studies, which reported high level of satisfaction, appreciation ofpsychological support and interest for future psychoeduca- tional groups. Major themes emerged were distress and feelings of guilt about transmission to offspring, when todisclose information to relatives, anxiety and depression related. Between September 2018 and January 2020 we arranged six support groups for BRCA carriers and theirfamilies. Of 43 individuals participating to at least one group, 23 (53%) participated to more than one. Main rea- sons reported for participating were: desire to meet otherBRCA carriers (17; 40%) for 95% felt comfortable the group very useful. Twenty-seven participants(62,7%) declared their expectations had been completely satised; almost all declared they would participate to future groups. Major themes emerged were: how and when todisclose the information to offspring (particularly sons), why minors cannot be tested, differences between BRCA1 and BRCA2, prophylactic surgery, diet and hormone ther-apy. Our ndings support the usefulness of support groups for longitudinal follow-up of BRCA families. Supported by GOforLife and Susan G. Komen Italia Onlus. 1 B. Bertonazzi: None. L. Godino: None. S.

Medical University Varna, Varna, Bulgaria,2Laboratory of Medical Genetics, University Hospital St Marina, Varna, Bulgaria Introduction: Over the past decade, there has been a major increase in the number of genetic tests available. However,it is still not clear whether the patients could interpret the result themselves even for a routine genetic testing such as thrombophilia. Materials and Methods: We present a survey among 111 randomly selected patients, carried out at the Laboratory of Medical genetics, Varna. All of theparticipants underwent a genetic testing for hereditary predisposition to thrombophilia and their knowledge was evaluated before and after the test using Likert scale.Correlation analysis and t-tests were applied. Results: Mean age of the participants was 33.77 \u00b1 5.79 years. 74.77% of them had a masters degree. Most of thequestionned (70.27%) were referred to genetic testing by a medical specialist, 29.73% decided on their own to test themselves due to family predisposition. There was apositive correlation between receiving information from a medical doctor ( p=0.014) and the degree of understanding about the test. A negative correlation existed ( p=0.001) between the level of knowledge and informing on your own about the test. There was no statistically signi cant difference ( p=0.891) for the correlation between the source of information and awareness of the result. However, the degree of understanding was higher ( p=0.003), when the result was explained by a medical specialist. Theeducation level did not correlate with a better pre or post test knowledge ( p=0.949). Conclusions: Ourndings demonstrate the importance of pre and post test counseling of the patient and its crucial role in providing information about genetic testing to the patients. M. Levkova: None.

The diagnosticodyssey lasts 5 years on average for a rare disease patient (2). This delay in diagnosis prevents patients from accessing proper care and treatment. Several initiatives have beenestablished to improve the lives of people with undiagnosed rare diseases. However, currently, there is not a compre- hensive mapping of resources for undiagnosed or newlydiagnosed Ultra-Rare diseases. Within the EU funded pro- ject, Solve-RD, EURORDIS initiated the Community Engagement Task Force (CETF), a multi-stakeholdercommunity of patients, scientists, and clinicians, to sup- port the needs of the undiagnosed and recently diagnosed patients and leave a legacy of a strengthened undiagnosedcommunity.Methodology: Key stakeholders in the eld of diagnosis were invited to become members of CETF. These include Undiagnosed Diseases Network International (UDNI), SWAN (Syndrome Without A Name) Europe, Patient Advocacy Groups within the European Reference Networks and The Global Commission to End the DiagnosticOdyssey for Children. Results: Members gathered through 3 teleconferences and a face-to-face meeting over 15 months where theydiscussed issues addressing speci c needs of undiagnosed rare disease patients and their families such as lack of information for medical professionals and the need forstandardization when receiving a diagnosis. Resources (toolkits, surveys, factsheets, illustrations) were compiled to develop a roadmap. Conclusions: Regular and meaningful engagement of representatives across key initiatives represents the start of an active undiagnosed community. Importantly, patients asequal and valued partners are driving forward active collaborations with different stakeholders. G.H. Gumus: None. S. Broley: None. C. Patch: None. M. Montolio del Olmo: None.

P22.62.B Dying to see you; Deaths on a Clinical genetics waiting list; what are the consequences? L. Bradley, S. Lynch National Centre for Medical Genetics, Dublin 12, Ireland Introduction: The value of a Clinical Genetics consultation is difcult to quantify. In order to estimate negative effects and by default the value of a genetics consultation; we sought to identify the consequences to the patient and families who died on the waiting-list. Methods Audit records of 40 referrals who died prior to appointment. Results: Age range at referral: 11 days to 82yrs. Thirty ve of the 40 had never been seen; 5/40 died awaiting a follow up appointment. The majority (26/40) were cancer referrals. Ten had developmental delay/dysmorphism; 3were cardiac genetic referrals, & a dementia referral. We determined that 15/40 deaths posed a signi cant risk to genetic health in their relatives [proband not seen, no familycontact, no genetic testing & no DNA stored]; 10/40 posed a moderate risk [DNA stored or predictive test available but784 J. del Picchiano family contact]; 13/40 posed a minimal risk [proband never counselled] and in 2/40 cases the families were fully counselled. From the 25 probands where the death posed a moderate or signi cant risk, we identi ed a minimum of 118 (~5 individuals per proband) rst degree living relatives. DNA was stored on only 5/25 precluding abilityto risk stratify in 20 families unless another relative is subsequently genetically diagnosed. Most families did not avail of offers of appointments posthumously raisingconcern that relatives remain unaware of their genetic risks. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the relatives of 65% (25/40) of probands are substantially disenfranchised if theiraffected relative dies whilst awaiting an appointment. L. Bradley: None. S.

Skinner Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa Introduction: Advances in prenatal testing technologies lead to more women receiving a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome (DS). As this is an incurable disabling condition,they are confronted with the decision of having a termina- tion of pregnancy (TOP). This has long-term psychosocial implications which are poorly understood. The aim of thisstudy was to gain an understanding of the experiences of South African women who have had a TOP for DS and the psychosocial impact thereof. Methods: A phenomenological qualitative approach was used. Eight participants were purposively selected from a prenatal clinic at a state sector hospital in South Africa(SA). They were interviewed shortly after being admitted to hospital for the TOP and again 6 to 12 months afterwards. The audio-recordings were transcribed and thematicanalysis was used. Results: Prenatal testing services are not widely acces- sible in SA and therefore the participants all had a second-trimester TOP. The themes identi ed with regards to the psychological implications were: grief, impact of seeing stillborn, guilt, isolation, nding meaning, decision satisfac- tion and nding peace. The social impact included change in workplace, TOP stigma, moving house and change in relationships. The participants valued support from religiousgroups, partners, family, friends, health care workers and employers. Conclusions: The major long-term psychosocial impact of a TOP made it dif cult for the women to return to their normal daily routine. Understanding the impact of this eventwill deepen knowledge on how to best care for these women and may subsequently improve prenatal testing and counselling practices. C.J. Scott: None. M.F.

P23 Ethical, Legal and Psychosocial Aspects in Genetics P23.02.B Managing actionable secondary ndings beyond high- penetrant genes through personalised health surveillance R. , E. Felber Megeno S.A., Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg Genome-informed prevention holds the promise of improving clinical outcomes among individuals at sig- nicant risk for developing a disease with a strong genetic component, by enabling personalised phenotypic surveil-lance for monitoring predictive biomarkers and detecting early disease symptoms. However, in the context of low- penetrance diseases, gathering reliable phenotypic infor-mation to facilitate such early detection is challenging, since many at-risk individuals will never develop the disease. In particular, there is a risk of overdiagnosis and over-treatment, leading to an inef cient use of scarce healthcare resources. Furthermore, it is crucial that clinically healthy individuals are not prematurely designated as patients. Toaddress these issues, we have developed a rigorous, 100- point-scale scoring scheme for prioritising low-penetrance diseases to facilitate long-term risk monitoring and earlydisease detection. A key variable to our scoring scheme is \"at-home phenotyping \" , that is, the ease and accuracy with which an at-risk individual can regularly sample andmonitor relevant phenotypic markers over time, without recourse to their medical professional. We have applied the scoring scheme to evaluate and rank 23 monogenic dis-orders characterised by reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. The scores for the 23 disorders ranged from 40.0 to 88.3, with a mean of 65.3 (median of 65.8). Dis-orders with the and ranking medically relevant gene-disease associations, it may be possible to prioritise low-penetrance disorders for facilitating long-term personalised health sur-veillance in an ef cient and responsible manner.

Mouret-Fourme3, Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France, 3Department of Genetics, Institut Curie, Paris, France, and Genetic Montpellier to determine psychosocial factors associated with the gendered of uptake of geneticcounseling among children of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using semi- structured interviews from a comprehensive approach. Datawere analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Thirty mutation carriers (23 women, 7 men) aged from 40 to 60 years took part in the interviews. Theparticipants included are parents of an overall of 72 children (31 minors including 17 girls and 41 adults including 24 women). The themes included: mutation discovery, bodyand risk management and communication to their children from disclosure to genetic test up-taking. We explored the role of both parents in the transmission of cancer preventionpractices, considering their own risk management, the disclosure of the mutation to their children and their role on the genetic test up-taking of their children. We found thatgender differences are explained both by different social roles, but also by different relationship to cancers linked to BRCA and perceived as \"feminine\" and also by differenthealth practices. Conclusions: Cancer prevention is shaped by the complex links between gender norms and health practices.This has practical implications since the genetic risk communication and genetic test up-taking could be better framed taking this information into accountF.

P23.06.C Cancer worry and willingness to undergo colonoscopy at different risk levels; results from a population-based survey in Sweden C. Hawranek 1, J. Maxon1, A. Andersson1, B. Van Guelpen1,2, University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden Introduction: Inherited genetic risk factors are known to induce cancer worry in at-risk individuals, affecting riskperception and screening uptake. The Cancer Worry Scale (CWS) has been used to evaluate cancer worry in these populations. This is the rst population-based study describing the distribution of cancer worry and willingness to partake in screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). Materials and Methods: Data was sourced through a probability-based citizen panel. In total, 1800 individuals between ages 18-74 were invited. 943 respondents (52% response rate) completed an 6-item CWS (min 6, max 24)and questions on willingness to undergo colonoscopy in hypothetical situations of having a 5%, 10% or 70% lifetime risk of developing CRC. Results: Cancer worry scores were signi cantly higher [mean 9.17 (SD 2.59)], p< 0.01. Personal cancer history was associated with higher worry scores [11.00 (SD 3.63)] vs [9.46 (SD 2.72)], p< 0.05, but age, educational level and country of birth was not, p> 0.05. Women 's higher scores persisted regardless of previous cancer or not. In the CRC- screening scenarios, the proportion willing to undergo colonoscopy increased with increasing levels of hypothe-tical risk; 58% risk), 92% (70% lifetime risk). Conclusions: Gender and cancer history was related to increased cancer worry in this population-based sample. Willingness to undergo colonoscopy increased signi cantly with the presented increased risk of CRC. Interestingly, ourpopulation-based results overlapped with previously reported CSW-scores in several different cancer populations. Grants: Cancer research foundation in Norrland and Forte. C.

Despite its favorablediagnostic performance compared to conventional testing strategies, routine use of WGS is hampered by insuf cient evidence of clinical utility. Largely, this evidence gap stemsfrom complexities and inconsistencies in how this concept is de ned and measured. For example, what constitutes clinical utility for WGS varies by stakeholder perspective,clinical context, and test application. A rapidly evolving technology landscape and challenges associated with executing robust comparative study designs in the contextof rare disease further impede progress in this area. Methods: An expert working group, representing a range of clinical settings in which WGS is in translation, wasformed to provide practical guidance to practitioners and researchers to address the challenge of measuring clinical utility. Results: Following a consensus-based process and aligned with a broad de nition of clinical utility, we propose a conceptually-grounded and empirically-guidedmeasurement toolkit focused on four domains of clinical utility: diagnostic ef cacy, therapeutic cacy ef cacy. For each domain, we offer speci c indicators and measurementstrategies that can be integrated into new and ongoing studies. Conclusions: While we focus on diagnostic applications of WGS for rare germline diseases, this toolkit offers a flexible framework for best practices related to measuring clinical utility for a range of WGS applications. As such, itprovides a resource for laboratories, clinicians, and researchers looking to characterize the value of WGS beyond the laboratory. R.Z. Hayeems: None. D. Dimmock: None. D. Bick: None. J.

The present study examined the susceptibility properties of COMT genotype to adverse and favorable parenting styles in relation to childhood problem behaviors. Materials and Methods: The sample was composed of community children ( N=175; 80 boys; T1 age=6.98; T2age=9.78) and their parents chosen through a multistage stage random sampling procedure. At T1, children were genotyped for COMT-rs4680, whereas parents rated their parenting styles. DNA was extracted from buccal swabs andgenotyped using PCR System. At T2, teachers rated children 's problem behaviors. As in previous studies, we divided the sample into those with theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 787high-activity Val/Val genotype or more Met alleles (79.1%). Results: Using a regression analysis, a signi cant interactive effect was observed only for the authoritarian parenting and COMT genotype. Speci cally, children who had faced authoritarian parents and were Val homozygotesexhibited more future problem behaviors ( p=.041) than did their Met-carrying counterparts. Notably, in the absence of authoritarian parenting practices, Val homozygotesdisplayed signi cantly lower aggression scores than did Met carriers ( p=.039). Conclusions: These results suggest that Val homozygotes are more malleable to the effect of negative home environment on problem behaviors.

Kagkelari3, Melbourne, Australia When a disease-causing genetic variant is identi ed in an individual, communicating this information to familymembers can play an essential role in the early diagnosis of relatives. Yet, many patients struggle with communicating these results and it is unclear to what extent this is discussedduring the consent process. To better understand if and how the communication of genetic information to family mem- bers is addressed in the clinical context, we systematicallysearched for consent forms for diagnostic genomic sequencing online and used content analysis to analyze the forms. We identi ed 68 consent forms from 11 countries. The forms indicated that genetic ndings were often pre- sented as familial in nature, yet varied in how ndings with familial implications were discussed. A minority of provi-ders addressed communication of genetic information with family members, with differences in whether the health professional or the patient would be responsible for thisprocess. Several forms offered patients options regarding communication that contradicted national guidelines and legislation regarding the disclosure of results in the absenceof patient consent. This is concerning because it shows how patients and clinicians could be misled about whether or notcommunication is permissible in cases where the patient does not consent. Our research questions whether providers and health professionals receive adequate education and training, especially with regards to the ethical problems raised by genetic ndings. Based on our analysis, we make recommendations for how to address genetic ndings with familial implications in the clinical consent process. A.M. Phillips: None. E. Niemiec: None. H.C. Howard: None.

Pedro, Rica,2Centro de Investigacion en Biologia Celular y Molecular, Universidad de Costa Rica, SanPedro, Costa Rica Introduction: Technological advances in molecular genetics have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of genomic data. Sharing study data within the research community raises important issues such as trust, privacy,and potential consequences. The goal of this study is to explore public attitudes and concerns in a sample of Costa Rican individuals regarding the donation of personalgenetic data for research purposes. Materials and Methods: A total of 224 Costa Rican individuals answered the anonymous online survey \"Your DNA, Your Say \". The survey covers basic demographic information, attitudes, trust in research professionals, and concerns regarding donation of medical and genetic data. Results: A majority of individuals (93%) are willing to donate their DNA and medical information to at least one kind of research professional (from three categories:medical doctor, non-pro t researcher, for-pro t researcher). Willingness to donate differs signi cantly according to the potential use of the data and is lowest in the case of for-prot research. The top concerns about sharing of genetic data are discrimination by health or life insurance companies and employers. When asked about levels oftrust in different professionals and the government, the top ranked categories were the person 's own medical doctor and researchers at a university in the person 's country. Conclusions: This is the rst study dealing with the attitude toward sharing of genetic and medical information in Costa Rica. In general, we found a higher willingness toshare genetic information for research purposes than what has been reported for other non- Latin American countries.788 J. del PicchiaG.

P23.19.A Human genome and gene-editing: opinions of National Ethics/Bioethics Committees technolo- gies, as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, are very promising for prevention and treatment of human diseases. Ethical con- cerns arise from the use of GE on human germ-cell linesand embryos, whose debate has been ampli ed by the birth of two Chinese gene-edited twin girls. In the last few years National Ethics/Bioethics Committees (NC) in Europe havebeen releasing documents about the use of GE, in particular on human genome. Materials and Methods: In this work we summarise and analyse the following documents released by European NC: a)\"Statement from the Danish Council on Ethics on genetic modication of future humans In response to advances in the CRISPR technology \", 2016; b) \"GE: an ethical review \", Nufeld Council on Bioethics \"(NuCoB), 2016; c) Opinion N25/2016, Swiss National Advisory Commission onBiomedical Ethics, 2016 ; d) \"Recent developments in human genome modi cation: GE \", Hellenic NC, 2016; e) \"Ethical issues in GE using CRISPR/CAS9 \", Italian National Bioethics Committee, 2017; f) \"GE and reproduction\", NuCoB 2018; g) \"Intervening in the Human Germline \", German Ethics Council, 2019. Results: Different ethical opinions, even inside a same Committee, are expressed about genetic modi cations concerning early embryos not nalised to reproduction and germ cells/fertilised cells edited for therapeutic purposes, e.g. to remove disease susceptibility in the offspring. Conclusions: Bioethical viewpoints across European NC vary indeed in a considerable way, from those focused mainly on the potential bene ts of these methodologies to those more cautious. G.

Nagai1,I i1, Z. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan,2University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan In Japan, direct-to-consumer genetic testing has been also freely accessible without any regulations since 1990s. The Japanese government nally launched a comprehensive policy for promoting cancer genomic medicine and storinganonymized patients 'clinical and genomic data to the National Data Repository in 2017. However, discussions regarding the prevention of genetic discrimination have notyet been active. The objectives of this survey were to determine the extent of genetic literacy and attitudes of the Japanese public toward genomic medicine and to estimatethe prevalence of genetic discrimination. Cross-sectional and anonymous online surveys were distributed to adults in Japan in February 2017 and again in January 2020. Thendings of the surveys conducted in 2017 ( N=10,881) and 2020 ( N=10,245) were compared, referring to our dataset since 2005. The recognition rate of \"genome \"became higher (69.7% in 2005, 73.2% in 2017, 85.1% in 2020 respectively). Respondents 'experiences of being required to submit personal genetic information were \"life insurance for medical bene ts or death bene ts\"(2.1% in 2017, 1.5% in 2020 respectively) and \"from my partner or his/her relatives \"(0.3% in both years). Overall bene ts of using genetic information were recognized higher than concerns. As genome medicine becomes more familiar to people in the near future, their concerns about the utilization ofgenetic information may increase. The policy to prevent genetic discrimination should be considered urgently. K. Muto: None. A. Nagai: None. I. Ri: None. Z. Yamagata: None.

The genetic research in Latvia is currently regulated by several national regulations,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 789but the most have been developed more than 15 years ago and do not meet current international standards preventing the successful functioning of biobanks and genetic research data obtainment in Latvia. The aim of the study was to analyze the public 's attitudes, concerns and trust in research biobanking and genetic research in Latvia. Materials and Methods: The questionnaire was based on 2010 Eurobarometer questionnaire (questions number B12- B18 in the original questionnaire). Five nationally relevantquestions were added. The survey was conducted in March 2019 and used multi-stage strati ed random sampling to obtain a representative sample of the general population ofLatvia (aged 18 to 75 years). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, v. 23. Results: 1017 responders participated in the survey. 35.6% expressed concerns donating their medical history data and 27.5% their genetic data to the research, respondents were less concerned for donating their lifestyleinformation (25.8%), blood (25.5%) or tissue (26.7%). 59.6% supported the data and biological sample exchange between EU member states for research purposes. 25.6% ofrespondents were familiar with term \"biobank \", 19.2% have heard about national biobank.

This study aimed to quantify perceived value of GS to cancer patients and their relatives,and factors associated with value.Materials and Methods: Participants were recruited on consent to a genomics study. Eligible participants (with cancer of likely genetic aetiology, or a rst-degree relative) completed a questionnaire prior to GS. Willingness-to-pay was assessed via a hypothetical trade-off scenario of actionable result return-rates of 1%, 10%, 20%, 30%,40% or 50% respectively. Results: 348 probands and 213 relatives (92% response rate), 81% would have GS for as little as a 1%actionable return-rate. Participants would pay a median of $1,000 for return-rates of at least 20% (probands) or 30% (relatives), and $300 for lower return-rates. 114 (35%)probands and 64 (31%) relatives would pay $1,000 for a 1% actionable return rate, while 108 (33%) of probands and 76 (36%) of relatives would not pay $1,000 even for a 50%return rate. Probands with common cancers and negative attitudes to uncertainty were more likely to have GS; those with higher education were more willing to pay $1,000 and$3,000 at lower return-rates. Conclusions: This study found high interest in, but lower willingness-to-pay for GS in patients with cancers of likelygenetic aetiology and their rst-degree relatives, possibly due to inability to pay. To avoid inequity, the health system should consider universal coverage of GS. Funded byNHMRC and CINSW. M. Best: None. P. Butow: None. G. Davies: None. C. Napier: None. N. Bartley: None. M.

Genetic counselling supports their decision-making process. However, factors in fluencing the genetic testing decision-making process have not been studied in Switzerland so far. This study thus aims to investigate the decision-making process of people under-going genetic counselling for cancer predisposition in Switzerland. Grounded theory is the methodological790 J. del Picchiaapproach of this qualitative interview study. Eighteen individuals were retrospectively asked about their decision- making process, including both acceptors and decliners of genetic testing. Additionally, participants were asked in hypothetical vignettes whether they would undergo genetic testing for nonactionable genetic variants. Two healthcareprofessionals providing genetic counselling were inter- viewed for data triangulation. We found that the underlying life philosophy of either leaving life to fate or preferringcontrol in fluences genetic testing decision-making impor- tantly. However, other factors might shape this decision: People look for certainty; anticipate consequences; aresocially in fluenced; simplify risks; decide intuitively or reflectively, and trust in science to different degrees. Our results visualise a theory of genetic testing decision-makingthat comprises both acceptors and decliners. It might help healthcare professionals and carriers informing family members to anticipate differing life philosophies, and, thus,differing attitudes towards genetic testing for both action- able and non-actionable genetic variants.

Brunner2, Arens1, Netherlands,2Radboudumc, in clinical exome sequencing are variants unrelated to the initial clinical question, that could be of medical relevance to patients and/or their families. The management and disclosure of IFs is a topic of debate. Little is known about the impact of IFs on patients 'lives. Materials and Methods: We conducted 20 semi- structured face-to-face interviews with patients and/or their relatives who had an oncological ( n=10) or cardiological (n=10) IF disclosed. Results: Almost all patients indicated they would undergo genetic testing again. For participants, the impactof an IF consists of the psychological, physical and the nancial impact. These dimensions are interrelated and appear to be in fluenced by the actionability, understanding the implications of the IF, the pre-test health of the patient and the social context.Conclusions: Disclosure of IFs in exome sequencing does not seem to greatly affect the lives of patients and their family ifpatients are enabled to realize the actionability of the IF and get a grip on the consequences of the nding. We observe a difference in perceived impact of oncological and cardiological IFs. We propose a coordinating role for theclinical geneticist to facilitate the empowerment of patients with an IF.

The extreme heterogeneity of these neurodevelop- mental disorders and the rarity of identi ed cases for many of the implicated genes render the goal of de ning the clinical spectrum, comorbidities and natural history a daunting task. We reasoned that a participatory approach would be a relevant alternative whereby clinical informationis entered and updated by the family of the proband using a structured online questionnaire in 5 languages at https:// genida.unistra.fr We used the Koolen-de Vries syndrome (KdvS 17q21.31del / KANSL1mut) for a proof-of-concept of the approach. Methods and Results: The current questionnaire has 41 multiple choice questions and 92 sub-questions analyzed automatically, and 5 open text qualitative questions. Currently, the questionnaire has been lled for 808 patients with a known genetic diagnosis. The KdVS cohort is the largest, with 202 probands.

Van Hoyweghen1 1Centre for Sociological Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,2Centre for Biomedical Ethics and Law, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Although Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has increased our ability to test and diagnose, the type of data that isgenerated by NGS techniques and their interpretation leaves room for a considerable amount of uncertainty. NGS not only generates a vast amount of data, the results are oftennot very clear-cut. In many instances, analysis does not reveal a straightforward diagnostic cause for the symptoms, requiring a more complex interpretation and negotiationprocess. The type of delineation work this lack of clarity necessitates is not uncommon in medicine: diagnostic denitions and criteria change over time, which allows new diagnoses to arise and others to be lumped together, split or dissolved. In NGS, the boundaries of what counts as 'evi- dence 'for variant interpretation, what is relevant to report to patients, and what constitutes a diagnosis is continuously reshaped in everyday practice. In this early implementation phase of NGS, in which standardization efforts are not yetsolidi ed, the boundary struggles in laboratory and clinical practice are particularly visible. To explore the complexities in the social shaping of diagnosis in NGS settings, we cri-tically review the literature on the sociology of health and illness, sociology of diagnosis, and science and technology studies on the meaning and social construction of diagnosis.We then assess the current state of NGS practice through this lens. We discuss what it entails to give and receive a diagnosis using NGS, how this differs from diagnosesidenti ed through more 'traditional 'diagnostic technolo- gies, and what role uncertainty plays in this.J.M.L.

Findings other than tris-omy 21, 18 or 13 are reported on request of the pregnant woman, 78% of women chose to have these reported. The rst year, a total of 207 incidental ndings (IF) other than the three common trisomies were detected. This survey study examined women 's experiences of being informed of an IF and its psychological impact. One-hundred thirteen(54.6%) women completed the questionnaire. Most women (59.3%) chose for IF because they wanted to know as much as possible about the health of their unborn child. Slightlymore than half (57.5%) did not nd deciding for IF dif cult, however only 25.6% felt they had an idea of what IF could be before having NIPT. Almost all (98.2%) women metwith a clinical geneticist to discuss their IF, for 82.3% of them this helped in understanding their result. Sixteen women (14.2%) ended their pregnancy because ofabnormalities resulting from the IF, whereas 85 (75.2%) gave birth to a child without anomalies. For most women (85.9%) the IF caused them great worry. However, a vastmajority (89.3%) would opt for NIPT again in a future pregnancy, of whom 71% would opt for IF again. This study gives an insight in how pregnant women experiencereceiving an IF from NIPT. For most women the IF caused worry, however most of them would opt for NIPT with IF again. I.M. Bakkeren: None.

Genetics, section Commu- nity Genetics, Amsterdam, Netherlands,2Maastricht Uni- versity, Department of Health, Ethics and Society, Maastricht, Netherlands Analyzing clinical exome and genome sequences beyond the primary indication (opportunistic screening) has been subject to international debate. Arguments evolved aroundthe 2013 American College of Medical Genetics recom- mendations to analyze and disclose a minimum list of actionable variants. Reasons to support opportunisticscreening include, utilizing available data as an opportunity to identify and manage risks for the selected highly pene- trant genetic disorders. Experts, however, have also ques-tioned the clinical validity and utility of these ndings and posed serious ethical and social issues around informed consent, equity, potential psychosocial harm of receivingresults and impact on health care budgets. Pharmacogenetic variants have received little attention in these debates, while guidelines with actionable gene-drug prescriptions areavailable. The \"Dutch Consortium for Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues of Personalized Medicine (ELSI-PM) \"orga- nized a workshop on opportunistic screening for pharma-cogenetic variants, for relevant Dutch stakeholders. We aimed to elucidate the arguments for and against offering opportunistic pharmacogenetic screening to patientsundergoing sequencing with an overview of variants vant for future drug prescriptions; their personal \"myD- NAmedicationcard \". Participants agreed that such practice would pertain screening, should therefore meet corre- sponding screening criteria, and does not automatically fall under the duty of the physician offering the initial sequen-cing. Although many argued that it could be bene cial to have your personal pharmacogenetic information readily available when requiring drugs, many uncertaintiesemerged. Pilot studies could provide more insight in con- sequences of opportunistic pharmacogenetic screening. ELSI-PM is funded by ZonMw Organisationfor M.C. Cornel: None. P23.34.A Extent of knowledge about prenatal diagnostic testing in PolandM. L. Podstawka , M. Malarska Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, PolandAim: The aim was to assess the extent of knowledge of prenatal diagnostic testing among Polish people. Methods: This study was conducted via an online anonymous survey published on social media, targeted at Polish citizens of different age, sex, residence andeducational background. 1034 respondents answered a series of questions. Results: The results revealed that among respondents there are still many false beliefs about the antenatal examination, as well as many concerns regarding health service in general. Among other results, it was observed that53% do not know what amniocentesis is and of those who know 25% do not understand the risks associated with the procedure, 38.2% do not know what indications for CVSare, only 30% know what a free-DNA test is, 9% think that an ultrasound scan is harmful to the fetus and 26.4% of the respondents with children did not have any prenatal testsdone during pregnancy. Conclusions: Currently in Poland, the extent of knowl- edge and understanding of prenatal diagnostic testing israther pooras survey answers showed that people do not understand the procedures used in prenatal tests, their effectiveness and possible risks. Additionally, some of therespondents left remarks which suggested that they have a problem with access to prenatal diagnostics due to lack of information about the antenatal examinations. What becameclear is that there is a need to raise awareness about this issue, as well as educate patients and improve health service in Poland. M.L. Podstawka: None. M. Malarska: None. P23.35.B Family factors in a prenatal clinic; the extended trajectory of a single decision A. J. Clarke 1, S. Doheny1, O. Uzun2 1Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom,2Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, Cardiff, United Kingdom Decisions about whether to continue or terminate a preg- nancy, when the fetus is affected by a genetic condition and/ or a malformation, are often dif cult. Research into such decisions is also dif cult and sensitive. These decisions can raise many issues: ethical, social and practical. We report on the multiple factors considered by one family in the course of making their decision about apregnancy in which the fetus was found to be affected by Down syndrome and a cardiac malformation.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters 793We used multiple data sources to achieve this, collecting audio recordings of fetal cardiology clinics, a diary of thoughts and feelings kept by the pregnant woman until after the pregnancy, an audio recording of one family conversation and one interview at follow-up after the end of the study. We concentrate on the diary and the recordedfamily discussion as such material is not often accessed. The topics discussed include the contrasting feelings of the couple about a possible termination of the pregnancy,the perceived opinions of friends and family members, the efforts of the pregnant woman 's mother to be supportive, and the family 's efforts to 'read'the opinions of antenatal clinic professionals. We also note the family 's under- standings of the research process and its implications for \"informed consent \". This approach to research - recruiting patients as active participants in research into their experiences and decisions - adds substantially to our appreciation of their situation andtheir decisions and will be of value for re flective practice and training.

Zapp1, G. Lenzini1 1University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, 2Megeno S.A., Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg The potential of predictive and presymptomatic genetic testing to foster preventive healthcare has been widely recognised. However, the extent to which genetic tests are currently utilised for prevention purposes remainsunknown. In this study, we explore the practices of a large sample of European prevention centres (PCs) - i.e. medical institutions specialised in health maintenance and diseaseprevention - regarding their use of medical genetics. We identi ed PCs located within the European Economic Area based on their membership of relevant professional orga-nisations, participation in academic and business events related to preventive medicine, and a comprehensive online search. We reviewed PCs 'websites and information mate- rials, such as marketing brochures and videos, to gain insights into the availability of genomics-guided preventive services. In cases where provided information was deemedinsufcient, PCs were contacted with additional questions via email. Those PCs who did not reply to our email inquiries within two weeks were subsequently contacted viaa phone call. Our search identi ed 74 PCs located in 20 European countries. The highest number of PCs were basedin Germany (17/74; 23%), followed by Spain (9/74; 12%) and the Czech Republic (7/74; 9%). Of these, only six (8%) PCs fully incorporate genetic testing into their services to personalise preventive healthcare pathways for their custo- mers. These PCs also employ quali ed genetics profes- sionals who support customers through genetic counseling.The paucity of genome-informed services among PCs indicates a slow rate of adoption of genomics in preventive healthcare.

P23.37.A The latent class analysis to clarify the factors associated with the structure of the public attitude toward thegenome research at the survey in Japan . Z. Yamagata 1, K. Muto2 1University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan,2The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo,, Tokyo, Japan Aim: The aim of this study was to clarify the structure of the public attitude toward the genome research by the latentclass analysis. Methods: The nationwide surveys about the attitude toward the genome research were conducted in 2016 inJapan. The participants were comprised of 2,000 people (age, 20-69), selected from the Japanese general population by using the two-step strati ed random sampling method. Results: Five clusters were assumed as an explanation model of six variables related to the knowledge of genome and attitudes toward genomic research promotion aboutthree themes; basic genome research, genome research related to agriculture and medicine at the survey in 2016. They were able to be named \"Group of aggressive promotion \"(41.5%), \"Group of passive support \"(20.8%), \"Group not making judgment \"(19.2%), \"Group making prudent judgment \"(18.5%), and \"Group not interested in genome \". The results in 2008 and 2009 were almost the same as that in2005. It is possible to forecast to which cluster to belong according to respondent 's attribute, and we can forecast the reaction to other questions by using a cluster oppositely. For examples, \"Group of aggressive promotion \"is the layer of a high academic background, and is positive to donate their blood for the genome research, \"Group making prudent judgment \"is high academic back ground persons as same as \"Group of aggressive promo- tion\", and is interesting in the science and technology, but is negative to the blood donation for the research.794 J. del PicchiaZ.

P23.38.B Exploring responsibility about reproduction in the accounts of individuals at risk for and af-fected by late onset neurological diseases: a qualitative study Portugal,2Institute of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom People with a family history of hereditary disease com- monly face dif cult questions about reproduction. This study reports accounts of their reproductive decisions from people at-risk for or affected by the incurable, late-onset neurological diseases, familial amyloid polyneuropathyATTRVal30Met and Machado-Joseph disease. We draw on individual and family semi-structured interviews with par- ticipants recruited through the respective national patients ' associations ( n=35, 19 women; mean age: 39.2y, range 17-68). Data were analysed thematically. Findings revealed that participants drew on various - sometimes ambivalentand competing - relations to their awareness of genetic risk and their wish to have children. The elimination of genetic risk was perceived as responsible behaviour by some par-ticipants. For others, however, responsibility entailed accepting risks, because they prioritized values such as parenthood, family relationships and the value of life, aboveany concern about genetic disease. Some accounts were fraught with ambivalence, repentance and guilt, especially when children were born before participants knew of theiror their partner 's risk. Hope for future scienti c advances was often emphasized by those participants who already had children at-risk. We discuss the ndings in the context of the participants 'negotiations between reproductive risks and their sense of responsibility to self and others (including those not yet born), and how the accumulated multi-generational experience with the disease in fluence partici- pants 'decisions. We conclude that 'genetic responsibility ' is present not only in the accounts of those who chose not tohave children but also in those who knew their situation beforehand and still chose to have at-risk children. \u00c1.

P23.39.C ELSI challenges raised by France Introduction: The use sequencing technology becomes common practice in pediatric oncology to better understand the tumor process and to adapt treatments. This exam can eventually reveal constitutional information of interest forfamily members linked to the child cancer or incidental ndings. This highlights some ethical, legal and societal issues related to the information that should be delivered topatients that are minors and to their relatives, the right to know or not about this data and overall the consent to these somatic genetic tests. Materials and Methods: We surveyed the current and coming French bioethics legislation and the one on health applied to minors, the relevant international texts andrecommendations formulated by legal bodies and profes- sional societies. In addition, different consents forms were compared. Focus groups with patients and parents wereorganized in several pediatric oncology units to identify the information needs and to shed light on path improvements (professionals involved and temporal organization of suchproposals). Results: Initial results show disparate medical practices and an absence of speci c rules regarding the somatic genetic above all when realized on minors. However, the application of general principles of health care law offers precisions and some solutions have been planned in theFrench draft bill on bioethics. Conclusions: The need to regulate this practice and the communication of these data remains essential to respect theright of information of patients, their ability to consent and to improve the care of minors.

P23.40.A Intellectual functioning of adults with Silver-Russell syndrome due to IGF2/H19 hypomethylation in the11p15 region Vincent4, D. Martin-Coignard5, F. Petit6,R .Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive is severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, relative mac- rocephaly at birth, body asymmetry, prominent foreheadand feeding dif culties during childhood. Two main molecular mechanisms have been identi ed: a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (5-10%), andmethylation abnormalities of the 11p15.5 region (40-60%). To date, few studies have focused on the intellectual and cognitive pro le of individuals with SRS. However, these are important concerns for families. The few existing stu- dies are mainly focused on pediatric cohorts, but it is important to evaluate the intellectual pro le and cognitive abilities of patients with SSR across lifespan. Materials and Methods: Ten adults aged 18-39 years completed the Wechsler scale for adults. All of the patientshad SRS due to epimutation in the 11p15 region. Measures of interest included patients 'intelligence quotient (IQ) and four cognitive domains: verbal comprehension, perceptualreasoning, working memory, and processing speed. Clinical and medical information were also collected from inter- views and questionnaires. Results: The mean IQ score was in the average range ( M =95.40, SD=18.55). Patients had better performance in verbal comprehension compared to other domains. Frequentdaily dif culties were reported by patients: learningdisabilities and low self-esteem were perceived in 60% of adults. Conclusions: This study is one of the rst to document the intellectual functioning of adults with SRS. It shows that early intervention and multidisciplinary care from child- hood to adulthood appear to be important in this syndromefor care potential medical, cognitive and psychosocial problems. M.

P23.42.C Reporting and receiving uncertain prenatal whole exome sequencing results: How might healthcare providers and patients handle uncertainty? J. E. Klapwijk 1,2, H. T. Br\u00fcggenwirth1, K. E. M. Diderich1, K. Dijkstra2, S. R. Riedijk1 1Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands,2Department of Psychology, Education, and Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotter- dam, Rotterdam, Netherlands Introduction: Application of prenatal whole exome sequencing (WES) offers a much broader scope of results, but can also generate more uncertainty. We aimed toinvestigate how uncertain prenatal WES results might be handled by healthcare professionals (HCP 's) and patients and which individual characteristics may play a role.Exploring the impact of uncertainty in decision-making is instrumental in optimizing counselling in a prenatal setting. Materials and Methods: Two experiments were con- ducted among 51 medical students (HCP 's) and 76 psychology students (in the role of patients) respectively. Vignettes covering several types of uncertain prenatal WESresults were ranked on perceived uncertainty. Medical students answered whether they would report each result to the couple (experiment 1). Psychology students indicatedwhether they would want to receive the result (experiment 2). In both experiments participants indicated how certain they were about their choice. Results: In experiment 1, highly uncertain results were reported less often (59%) than results low in uncertainty (98%), p< .001. Furthermore, medical students reported more uncertainty with their choice when vignettes were high and moderate versus low in uncertainty, p< .001. In experiment 2, psychology students chose less often toreceive highly uncertain results (71%) than results low in uncertainty (87%), p=.012. They reported more796 J. del Picchiauncertainty about their choice when results were moderately and highly uncertain versus low in uncertainty, p< .001. Conclusions: In this study we validated the widespread hypothesis that the willingness both to convey and receive uncertain prenatal WES results decreased as uncertainty increased. J.E.

P23.44.B Ensuring ethical and legal compliance of cutting-edge DNA sequencing technologies: practical considerations from the for Innovative Genomics) is a European Infrastructure unifying the major European genomic centers providing external access to their facilities for performing genome sequencing(human, animal, vegetal) for research purposes. The mission of EASI-Genomics is to facilitate access tocutting-edge DNA sequencing technologies to researchers from both academia and industry, within or outside of Europe. Partners of the project have set up a process in order to ensure compliance with the relevant European ethical and legal framework at stake in human, animal or plantsequencing: a memorandum of understanding, a standard material transfer agreement and an interdisciplinary ethics check of each selected researcher before being allowed toaccess the sequencing services. After a year of experience and two calls for projects, some conclusions can be drawn on the main obstacles, limitationsand learning curves of such a process in guaranteeing compliance to the European ethical and legal framework. But most of all, this experience permitted to identify somerecurring issues that may need particular attention and efforts to ensure ELSI compliance. This is for instance the question of sequencing of ancient DNA in compliance withaccess and bene t sharing principles, or of the necessary safeguards regarding CRISPR-CAS9 engineered biomaterials.
