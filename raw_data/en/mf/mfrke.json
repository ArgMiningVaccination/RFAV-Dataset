A 1999 Gallup Poll,for example, found that 56 percent of whites and 77 percent of African Americans believed thatracial profiling exists (Newport 1999). In our own survey of adult, North Carolina-licensed drivers, 30 percent of whites and 80 percent of African Americans reported that they believedthat African Americans were more likely than other drivers to be pulled over by the police. \"Racial profiling\" and \"racial targeting\" refer to a fairly specific police practice of using race as an explicit criterion for deciding which cars to stop or search. \"Driving while black\" is a lessfocused term, but summarizes a widespread belief in minority communities that they are singledout for harsher treatment than are white drivers. In designing this project we were faced with three associated issues. First, the actual degree and spatial/organizational distribution of racial disparity in stops are not known and current methodologies are inadequate for establishing scientifically reasonable estimates ofdisparity. This project develops and evalua tes a series of alternate methodologies for2establishing the degree of racial disparity in stops. Second, the political attention to this complex phenomenon needs to be clarified with theoretical understandings of the various mechanismswhich plausibly could produce racial disparity in police stops. While racial profiling, the explicit use of race by police as an indicator of potential criminal status, might be one such mechanism, there is no reason to believe it is the only or even most general mechanism. Forpolicy, ending explicit racial profiling might do very little to reduce racial disparity in policestops if other mechanisms produce racial disparity in stops and post-stop outcomes. Indeed, it isnecessary to examine mechanisms that, on their face, are not racially biased, but may in factwork to produce observed racial disparity in tra ffic stops. For example, one might expect some level of observed disparity in stops if police deployment, perhaps in response to calls for serviceor accident rates, increases police presence in areas that are disproportionately minority. Here,minority vehicle stops may be a function of increased patrols and resultant citizen contact. Third, regardless of the level or dispersion of ethnic disparity in stops, the perception that\"driving while black\" places some community members at special risk represents a widespreadthreat to the legitimacy of law enforcement. This project combines demographic analyses, highway observations, surveys of citizens, focus groups with drivers, and focus groups w ith North Carolina State Highway Patrol troopers to develop methodologies to estimate racial di sparity in traffic stops, identify plausible mechanisms producing those disparities, and learn more about the consequences of perceptionsof racial disparity in policing for trust in the police. This project began in 1999 when the North Carolina State Legislature mandated that the North Carolina State Highway Patrol (NCSHP), a nd all state law enforcement agencies, begin to assemble data on the racial distribution of all vehicular stops initiated by officers. The NCSHP3agreed to cooperate with us in a more thorough study of traffic stops and outcomes. The cooperation of the NCSHP allowed us access to a great deal of demographic data on stops aswell as cooperation in organizing focus groups with troopers and collecting observational dataon North Carolina highways. Our project is a joint effort of faculty researchers and graduateresearch assistants at North Carolina State University and North Carolina Central University. The research is intended to answer four basic questions: 1) Do NCSHP troopers stop minorities, particularly African Americans, on the road at higher rates than they do whites? 2)Once stopped, do African American citizens and wh ite citizens experience different rates for citations, written warnings, and searches? 3) What factors might account for highway stops? and4) How do African Americans and other ethni c minorities experience and respond to traffic stops? Our goal is to produce informed answers to these questions that can help to shape publicpolicy, police training, and citizen outreach. These specific research questions result from the way that we conceptualize the\"driving while black\" phenomenon. That is, we view \"driving while black\" as the result of at least threeprocesses: police stops of motorists, the d ecisions that motivate police stops, including racial and ethnic bias as well as drivers' behavior, and the interpretations of police stops by theminority communities. We have taken substantial care to produce appropriate baseline comparisons (denominators) for highway racial homogeneity or heterogeneity and driving behaviors. Baseline denominators have been produced from available records (such as licensed driverswithin counties), calculations to create estimates of \"drivers driving\" within NCSHP districts (in other words, it is necessary to estimate the number of drivers driving in a particular district [orarea] who do not reside in the district of obser vation), direct observation of motor vehicles and4drivers on the highway, and traffic accident rates. These various baseline denominators allow us to more completely examine the racial/ethnic differences in stop rates and outcomes in thecontexts of racial composition on the highway, driving behavior, and trooper activity (individual and organizational). Official Records (Citations, Written Warnings, Searches, Stops) Official record information provided by th e NCSHP includes data bases on vehicular stops, citations, written warnings, and searches. Our ability to verify that there were stop recordsto match all associated written warning or citation records is limited by the fact that there was noidentifying number linking the different data bases. The lack of such a linkage has implicationsfor our ability to assess whether, for example, every non-accident related citation has anassociated stop record. Using a restricted list of specific measures across data bases, we were unable to identify many stop records as matching the citation or written warning records. Indeed, we found that approximately one in three incidents that could have had a correspondingstop record did not - in part because stops at checkpoints no not require that a stop form be completed, calling into question the completeness of the stop record data and raising questionsabout why some stop records would not be filed. As a consequence, we focused much of our analytic attention on the citation, written warning, and search records. As for the general relationship between citations, written warnings,and the race of the driver, we found that there was considerable variation in the racialdistribution of these interventions across the types of behaviors that were likely to have resultedin the citation or written warning incident (such as speeding or unsafe vehicular movement). Our initial hypothesis was that the more subjectively measured behaviors, such as \"driving too5close\" or \"failure to yield,\" would show greater disparity than the more objectively measured behaviors, such as vehicular speeding (virtually always measured by radar guns when citationsare issued), having a revoked or expired license, or failure to wear a seat belt. The opposite isthe case: the more objectively measured indicators of violating behaviors in citations are moreoften involving African American drivers. This suggests the possible importance of variations in driver's behavior as a primary determinant of whether or not someone is cited. Racial disparity in official written warni ngs was generally found to be more pronounced than in citations. However, such disparity is inherently ambiguous. If African Americans aremore likely than whites to receive a written warning for \"unsafe movement,\" it may be evidenceof more lenient treatment of African American s (who are receiving a written warning rather than a citation) or it may be evidence of so-called pre-textual bias: troopers are stopping vehicles andgiving warnings as a pretext to looking over the vehicle for signs of contraband. Since searches by the NCSHP troopers are very rare, the latter interpretation is doubtful. The question of the extent of racial disparity in citations and written warnings issued by the NCSHP is much more complicated than looking at the racial distribution of the statedreasons for these interventions. Ideally, the statewide incidence of citations for a type ofvehicular behavior needs to be evaluated in terms of what are the likely mechanisms by whichstatewide patterns of disparity are generated. The understanding of when and where troopers aredeployed may go a long way to account for racial disparity. For example, if there are relativelymany African Americans living in urban areas of North Carolina, and the NCSHP over-patrolhighways in and near urban areas, the proportion of citations issued to African Americansstatewide may be enlarged. 6Somewhat to our surprise, we found empirical evidence to the effect that there is also racial variation by time of day in the distributi on of drivers on the highways of North Carolina. African Americans are more likely to be driving in the evening and early morning hours relativeto their distribution in the licensed driver population. To the extent that the NCSHP happens topatrol more at night is some areas could also enhance the racial disparity estimate. The process of evaluating whether the NCSHP stops and cites African Americans excessively is made easier if objective measures of drivers' behaviors are available againstwhich to compare with citation rates. For example, all else equal, we would expect that theproportion of African Americans stopped for speed ing or other infractions would mirror the corresponding rate at which these infractions occurred (if 20 percent of the drivers speeding areAfrican American then 20 percent of the drivers cited for speeding would also be AfricanAmerican). Toward the goal of establishing a method to measure objectively drivers speeding,we conducted an observational baseline study at fourteen sites. Each site consisted of between10 and 15 miles of highway (both directions). We sent a research team to each site for a week tomeasure the speeds of motorists passing our research vehicle, which was driving at the speedlimit while traveling these stretches of highway. We estimated the speed of the passingmotorists by using stop watches to measure the time it took the passing vehicle to pass the rearand front bumper of the researcher's van. These estimates were found to be within a few milesper hour of the actual speed (as validated in road tests that we conducted). We operationalized speeding as driving at or above the speed at which drivers were generally found to be cited for speeding and found that there were differences in the drivingbehaviors by race. Specifically, African Amer icans were over-represented among those driving above the \"speeding threshold\" at which drivers tend to be cited. However, the African7American over-representation declined above approximately 8 mph over the threshold speed, indicating that the relationship between vehicular speeding and race is more complicated than weinitially thought. The racial speeding differences that were observed, however, do notnecessarily generalize to all highways in North Carolina, nor should they be used to generalize toother states. As argued in the report, the relationship between speeding and race is potentiallyquite complex, having to do with the types of roads and reasons for driving, among other things. The observational baseline study was particularly useful in alerting us to the fact that there is considerable variation in the proportion of drivers who are African American across evenvery proximate locales. Even the same highway a few miles apart or two highways intersectingmay have a substantially different racial composition. Subtle differences in the volume ofpatrolling could interact with the variations in where African American drivers drive to generatehigher or lower percentages of African American drivers stopped and cited. That is, the percentof those stopped and cited who are African Ameri can may reflect variation in the deployment of troopers to one highway over another. Unfortunately, we do not have measures at the verymicro-level of where troopers patrol. We only have records of troopers having written a citationor written warning in what we call county highway areas (segments of highway within about athird of a county). The unmeasured variation in patrolling, coupled with unmeasured racialcomposition of specific segments of highway (smaller than a county highway area), is referred toas the \"spatial heterogeneity\" problem. This reduces our ability to make strong claims about thedegree of racial disparity and about the likeli hood that racial bias accounts for such disparity. So far we have been speaking about what is unavailable to us: multiple and objective measures of driving behavior and of where (precisely) troopers spend their time patrolling. On amore positive methodological note, we do have measures that can partially substitute for the lack8of direct measures of the behavior of driver s, and we can make some reasonable assumptions about patrolling so as to lessen the likelihood of spatial heterogeneity problems. Specifically, wehave measures of the resident driving population living in an area such as a county (100 countiesin North Carolina) or patrol district (fifty-three such districts). We were able to utilize data onthe residency of drivers cited outside of their county of residency to create an estimate of\"drivers driving\" in an area (in a nutshell, we estimate the proportion of drivers driving in adistrict based on the assumption that their driving out side of their district of residency is racially proportional to the composition of licensed drivers within their district\u2014see discussion in thereport for details). A third source of data to be used as a baseline against which to comparecitation and written warning rates is the racial composition of drivers in accidents. This thirdsource of information is particularly useful in that it can be measured at relatively small units ofanalysis (the county highway areas alluded to above). We found that we could measure theproportion of those drivers involved in accidents who are African American at these relatively small units of analysis. While not an ideal unit of analysis, the county highway areas representsome degree of control for spatial heterogeneity problems. Having discussed some of the primary methodological issues, we turn our attention to the results of the analysis. The analysis is broken down into two parts. The first assesses whether ornot there are any districts which have a high ra te of citations of African Americans (end of Chapter 2). The second describes some models for assessing whether specific troopers haveunduly high numbers of citations of African Americans (Chapter 3). For the aggregate analysis, in which our goal is to determine whether or not there are any districts (of the fifty-three NCSHP district s) with unduly high citation rates of African Americans, we show that there are several such districts (varying by night and day times) that9qualify as \"positive outliers\"\u2014the districts \"lie\" outside a range of measurement that is likely due to measurement error, and as such, qualifies them for further scrutiny as to possible racialdisparity. At the same time, it must be mentioned that there are even more districts that are\"negative outliers\"\u2014 in other words, they have fewer citations of African Americans relative tothe prevalence of African Americans in accidents. Thus, some observers might attribute thepattern of results to measurement error or to factors that were unspecified in the analysis(uncontrolled factors). It should also be menti oned that the specific districts defined as positive or negative outliers will vary somewhat depending on which baseline (resident drivers, \"driversdriving,\" or accidents) is used. Thus, there is ambiguity as to whether any particular area issuspect as having unduly high levels of racial disparity. Such a finding of ambiguity may be disquieting to those who would want to know what might seem to be a straight answer to a simple question: is a troop racially biased or not? Weinterpret our evidence to mean that we can safely rule out widespread and large degrees of racialdisparity in the behaviors of the NCSHP across districts. However, we cannot rule out with certainty the presence of small degrees of racial disparity. That is, in some districts there may besome disparity that cannot be accounted for by the deployment patterns of troopers, but ourmeasures and methods are not adequate to tell conclusively. Some will argue that our models arenot sufficiently fine-tuned to rule out non-bias interpretations. We agree, but we do not have measures of what those factors might be. If ther e is racial bias operating, it is most likely of a \"cognitive\" sort (defined as bias that does not stem from conscious or overt racial antagonism). As for the presence of racial bias in the behaviors of individual troopers, we are dealing with a somewhat different policy issue since evidence of racial disparity may be grounds for\"personnel action\"\u2014at least of an investigative sort. That is, if a trooper has a tendency to cite10more African Americans than he or she \"should\"\u2014relative to some baseline- then there may be grounds for looking further as to whether or not the officer is a \"positive outlier.\" Thisinvestigation would presumably weigh further evidence so as to determine if there are reasonsother than bias for the high number of citations of African Americans. Thus, our research herehas as its goal to show methods that could be used to identify the \"outlier\" troopers, and not toclaim that any specific trooper is disparate or biased in his or her citation behavior. We present some regression models at the individual trooper level in which the dependent variable is the number of African Americans cited in the year 2000. We find that acontrol variable for the volume of citations (specifically, the number of whites cited) is a strongdeterminant of citing of African Americans. So too is any of a number of contextual measures (the percent of citations issued by other troopers to African Americans or the percent of driversin accidents who are African American). Time of day effects (such as late evening or early morning) and type of highway (interstate or rural highways) are also found. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of the variance in the citation of African Americans is explained by these factors. When we try to identify troopers who represent positive and negative outliers relative to the ordinary least squares model, we find that approximately eighteen are \"positive\" outliers(have more citations of African Americans than our model indicates should be \"expected\") andslightly more are \"negative\" outliers (fewer cita tions of African Americans). More sophisticated statistical models indicate only partial overlap in who is a positive or negative outlier. Thus,some of the \"positive outliers\" from the ordinary least squares model may be \"false positives,\" assome of the negatives may be \"false\" also. Su ch findings are unfortunate from an efficiency point of view, since there are multiple classifications of who has high (or low) levels of citationsof African Americans. However, recall that our purpose is to show that the statistical models can11be used as part of a more general strategy to assess whether or not racial disparity or bias is present in the actions of individual troopers rather than to claim that any officer is disparate orbiased. We think we have accomplished that purpose. One final set of findings based on official records includes the study of the consent and probable cause searches conducted by the NCSHP. We distinguish between the behavior of theregular road trooper (who rarely searches a vehicle) from that of the Criminal Interdiction Team(CIT\u2014whose job it is to stop vehicles, question drivers, and search for contraband such as drugsor guns). For the regular trooper, almost all of them seem to avoid proactive work toward thegoal of conducting a search. The small volume of consent searches (searches justified based onsome suspicion, yet requiring the permission of the driver to conduct the search) indicates thatthe regular trooper is not proactively looking to conduct searches. Among the small number oftroopers who make up the CIT (about thirteen in calender year 2000), searches are morecommon place (although the number dropped off in the late 1990s to only a little more than onevehicular search per day by the year 2000). As for the racial composition of the searches, theCIT troopers are more likely to search the vehicle of an African American stopped than that of a white. They did so somewhat inefficiently as late as 1997, but by 2000 the \"hit rate\"(successfully finding drugs or other contraband) was higher for an African American driven vehicle than a white driven vehicle (however, we do not mean to suggest that the high rate offinding contraband justifies the high search rate of African Americans, as that is a more complexquestion, involving utility and civil libertarian concerns beyond to the scope of our project). As for the mechanism that could account for the disparity in the search rates of African Americans, it seems to us, based on discussions with CIT troopers, that their use of the\"conversational method\" is one that could easily lead to the manifestation of disparity or bias. In12this method, they question drivers routinely and evaluate such factors as the consistency of the driver's answers and the degree of nervousness of the driver (and other vehicle occupants). Based on what they see and hear, they may decide to ask permission to search the vehicle. Wedo not know whether African American drivers are more likely to draw the suspicions of thetroopers because the troopers are \"looking harder\" for the proper \"signs\" due to the race of thedriver. There are alternative explanations about which we simply lack sufficient information. For example, African Americans' perceptions that the troopers are \"looking harder\" for someviolation when they are stopped may result in a higher prevalence of \"nervous behavior,\"independent of culpability during their stops. The plausibility that \"cognitive bias\" may account for the higher search rate of African American driven vehicles is enhanced by the CIT troopers' recognition that they use certaingeneralizations in their everyday interaction with the public. Decisions must be made on a dailybasis as to whether or not the citizen in front of them poses a threat to them or not. Style of dress, hair or verbal expressions will all be drawn upon by the trooper in making the decisions. Some typing is probably necessary for some decisions, such as whether or not to exerciseextreme caution. While we do not question the practical need for generalizing behaviors andsituations, we merely point out that \"typing\" people may lead to decisions that have raciallybiased implications. The Survey of North Carolina Drivers The North Carolina Driver Survey was designed to compliment the official statistics analysis described above. Official law enfo rcement statistics are accounts of citizen-trooper encounters provided by the individual trooper and organization, as complete and accurate as they13may be. Further, official data contain little information about driver behaviors which may provide an opportunity to examine whether drivers who are stopped actually drive differentlythan those who are not stopped. The survey data we collected allows us to collect informationon reported typical driving behaviors that may influence the probability of being stopped and to capture information about stops conducted by law enforcement agencies across the sate. In thesurvey we not only asked North Carolina drivers whether or not they were stopped, but also why they were stopped, the outcome of the stop, and how they were treated. Overall, the survey wasintended to 1) help develop more inclusive baseline estimates of African American and whitemotorists' differences in driving patterns a nd driving behavior; and 2) measure African American and white motorists' differences in traffic stop experiences and their respectiveinterpretations of the events. We conducted a telephone survey for a stratified random sample of current North Carolina licensed drivers (African American=1,368; white=1,487). The sample was stratified byrace in order to have sufficient sample sizes to compare the experiences of white and AfricanAmerican drivers. The sampling frame include d white and African American drivers who had applied for or renewed their licenses in the previous six months. Data were collected betweenJune 22, 2000, and March 20, 2001. A comparison of our final sample to the actual race-gender-age distribution of licensed drivers in North Carolina shows that our final sample is quite a good match to the statedistributions. Still, in all four gender-race groups, young adults age 30-39 are underrepresented. In most statistical analyses we weight the data to correspond to the known genderand age distributions of licensed drivers within the two race strata. 14African American drivers are significantly more likely than their white counterparts to report a traffic stop in North Carolina. The odds of a stop by local police may be twice as highfor African American as they are for white drivers even after controlling for other demographicstatuses and reported driving behavior. Local police are also significantly more likely to stop African American males relative to African American females, while among whites there is nogender disparity in stops after controlling for driving behavior. The estimated racial disparity in stops by the NCSHP is much smaller, but still statistically significant after controls for driver characteristics and reported driving behavior. The NCSHP does not stop African American males at higher rates than African Americanfemales net of driving behavior. Among the NCSH P troopers, race is linked to other attributes in the stop decision. Older whites and whites driving late model cars are less likely to be stoppedthan are other whites. African Americans who report more risky driving behaviors are morelikely to be stopped. This suggests that the NCSHP troopers are not simply reacting to the raceof the driver, but perhaps to the combination of race and other status attributes for whites andrace and driving behavior for African Americans. After the stop, differences in white and African American reported experiences are less dramatic. African Americans are slightly more likely to have been informed that the stop wasfor a more discretionary reason. African Americans are also slightly more likely to report thatthey were treated disrespectfully after the stop. There are no racial differences in the distributionof self-reported citations, written warnings, and verbal warnings. Racial differences inexperiences after the stop are small. Our telephone survey also addressed citizen trust. We found that distrust of law enforcement is produced by a combination of negative personal experiences with the police,15negative experiences of family and friends, belief in police profiling on both racial and non- racial grounds, general distrust of government institutions, and being a minority. The related problems of racial profiling and trust in the police are not simple ones. African Americans distrust the police because of their personal experiences and more generalcommunity orientations. Disrespectful interac tions are particularly powerful sources of both distrust in the police and belief in racial profiling. This is not, however, simply a perceptionproduced by direct experience. On the contrary, negative encounters with the police by familyand friends generate distrust and increase be lief in racial profiling. In fact, among African Americans, disrespectful police treatment or st ories of disrespectful police treatment can even undermine trust in government institutions in general. Belief in racial profiling undermines trustin the police even among whites. African Americans are more forgiving of the NCSHP than are whites. African Americans are more likely to translate negative experiences into distrust of local police forcesthan the NCSHP. This may reflect their observations of lower bias or more professional carriageby NCSHP troopers. Whites, on the other hand, are less discriminating. Any perception ofdisrespect or profiling undermines white trust in all types of police. Whites are particularlyinfluenced by perceptions of non-racial prof iling (for example a young driver playing loud music), perhaps because these are the types of profiling for which they or family members arethought to be most at risk. Thus while African Americans are more distrustful of the police in general than are white citizens, whites' trust in the police seems more vulnerable to recentexperiences and media portrayals. Citizen trust in police is also influenced by more general dispositions toward trust in government. This is true for white and African American citizens and for all types of police16examined. This suggests that the legitimacy of the police in general, and of specific police forces, is a nested problem. Police legitimacy is undermined by perceived disrespectfultreatment (especially among whites), belief in racial profiling (especially among AfricanAmericans), and belief in other forms of profiling (especially among whites). Where racialdisparity in treatment is lower, as in the NCSHP versus local police, African Americans do nottranslate negative experience into reduced trust. Police legitimacy is more vulnerable amongwhites. African Americans, however, have a lo wer level of trust in the police of all types stemming from their past experiences in, and cultural understanding of American society. Some of this can be seen in African Americans' lower trust in government institutions in general, butmost seems to be focused on a specific fear of the police. Distrust of the police among whites ismore strongly tied to distrust of government institutions in general. Citizen Focus Groups Citizen focus groups enable us to examine reported experiences of drivers and better understand the range of feelings about racially motivated traffic enforcement among bothAfrican Americans and whites. Specifically, we us ed these discussions with citizens to explore reported and perceived reasons for police stops, the perceived treatment of citizens by NCSHPtroopers as reported by the respondents, their experience with other law enforcement encounters(local, county, state), how the police-citizen en counter began and unfolded (did the stop result from a stationary radar unit, passing on a two-lane or four-lane road, or driving side by side), and what knowledge citizens can report about police-citizen encounters by other community mem-bers, friends and relatives. We were very interested in learning something about the themes andpatterns of their police-citizen encounters that might directly inform both policy and practice.17Our focus groups with African American drivers revealed a generally positive evaluation of the job that the police do. Participants were quick to say that the police had an important anddifficult job and that they were grateful for the good work they do. At the very same time manyof the African American drivers had very little trust in individual police officers. They felt atrisk for harassment and bias based on race and made considered analytic distinctions for eachand every time they were stopped. Some stops were judged fair, typically when the law wasbroken and they were treated with respect. In general, law enforcement as an institution wasdescribed as legitimate and reasonable, individual police were suspect, and racial bias wasattributed to \"bad apples.\" There was, however, some disagreement among African Americansas to how common the bad apples are. Stops that were not tied to serious illegal driving behavior\u2014the most common of which was the \"rolling stop sign\" pull-over\u2014were considered to be likely instances of racial bias. Inmany of these cases African Americans assumed race was the cause of the stop, because they didnot recognize any other legitimate reason. In some cases this assumption was confirmed by theofficer making the stop, such as when reporting that the African American citizen was stopped for being in the \"wrong\"\u2014that is to say \"white\"\u2014 neighborhood (and thus out of place). Oneyoung man spoke of the time he was stopped (with his brother), removed from the car, tackled,and had guns drawn on him for driving in a ne ighborhood where another African American man on foot was being pursued by the police. Here, apparently, \"young, back male on foot\" wasinterpreted as \"African American male anywhere.\" Lack of respect by the police during legitimate stops were also evaluated by some African American drivers as likely evidence of racial bias. Lack of respect in the interaction was interpreted as an indicator of racial bias, and encouraged the suspicion that the pull-over was18racially motivated as well. Troopers of the NCSHP, in contrast to officers attached to various local police forces, were singled out as treating dr ivers with respect and professionally. It was a clear pattern in the focus groups that African American drivers had less suspicion of the NCSHPthan they did of other police officers. While this evaluation mirrors our findings in the citizensurvey that racial disparity in police stops is lower among the NCSHP than among other lawenforcement agencies in North Carolina, the focus group participants used respectful treatment,rather than the rate of stops, as the basis for arguing that the NCSHP was better. In general, African Americans were more likely to perceive racial bias in a stop if the officer interacted with them in a disrespectful manner or if they were stopped without what theybelieved to be legitimate driving infractions. They seemed to be more than willing toacknowledge their personal responsibility for a \"real\" violation. What were seen as minorviolations were another story. Here they saw r ace as the predictor of the stop, not the violation. This is in contrast with white drivers who tended to see all stops, \"real\" or otherwise, asdiscretionary and idiosyncratic. White drivers talked about \"driving while blond\" or \"drivingwhile a musician\" or \"he should have cut me a break.\" In many ways white drivers evaluated thepolice more harshly than African American drivers did, and were also more likely to generalize\"unnecessary\" enforcement across agencies. African American drivers saw many stops aslegitimate and some as potentially racially biased. White drivers saw most stops as illegitimate,but idiosyncratic. We also found stark contrasts between African American and white drivers in evaluations of the \"driving while black\" phenomenon. African Americans tended to see it as just anotherexample of general and continuing racial bias. Racial bias in the policing of drivers was seen as a form of discrimination similar to the other forms of discrimination faced each day. Its existence19was confirmed by some combination of their own experiences, stories they had heard from friends and family, media reports on questi onable police behavior (Rodney King was often mentioned), and the existence of general levels of prejudice and discrimination in the society atlarge. White descriptions were considerably simpler and more disturbing. The white focus groups tended to accept that police targeted African American drivers, but described racialtargeting as at least understandable if not fair and justifiable. Since African Americans were stereotypically assumed to be more dangerous and thus more culpable, white citizens typicallysaw police stops on the basis of race as reasonable. Whites tended to use stereotypes andstatistical discrimination arguments similar to those sometimes used by police to justify racialtargeting. It seemed very easy for the white subjects to collectively justify discrimination inpolicing, even though they were quite resistant to taking personal responsibility for their ownpolice stops. As such, disgruntled white drivers are not natural allies of African Americandrivers who fear they are being harassed because of their race. NCSHP Focus Groups The purpose of the focus groups with NCSHP troopers was to inquire into the following domains: What circumstances are considered before, during, and after a stop? What are thetraining issues pertinent to highway traffic stops and how are they interpreted by NCSHPtroopers? Is there a perceived reward structur e that might influence the behavior of NCSHP troopers? And, what are the troopers' interpretations of racial differences in stops made by theNCSHP? 20Six focus groups were conducted in early June, 2001. Due to the racially sensitive nature of the topic, four focus groups were race-specifi c (two African American and two white). This was deemed appropriate in order to best provide a forum where respondents would feel lessrestricted, although each group noted that they would feel comfortable speaking in the presenceof fellow troopers. The management and command groups were racially diverse. Our randomselection process did not capture any women troopers (there are few women in the NCSHPrelative to men). Focus groups numbered from six to nine troopers and each lastedapproximately 2 hours. The sessions were facilitated by two members of the research team. Three other members of the research team observed the sessions shielded by a one-way glasswindow. The central issue, of course, was whether or not extra-legal factors (especially race) serve as the basis for the disproportionate number of stops involving African American and Latino drivers. It appears that troopers, for the most part, engage in enforcement patterns they believewould yield the greatest number of enforcement opportunities. A major determinant in thedecision to make a stop appears to be the \"behavior\" of the vehicle. The focus on such behaviorseems to vary situationally. The interstate, it is believed, is more likely to yield speedingviolations rather than seatbelt violations. Participants state that it is not possible to know therace of the driver on the interstate or at night. Rather, they report that their focus is the behaviorof the vehicle. Still, and significant given our interests here, not all troopers were unwilling toattribute likely traffic violations to specific segments of the community. Troopers also generally acknowledged that it is easier, because of reasons out of their control, to do their jobs in some places and not others. Simply, some citizens are more likely toresist the legality of the troopers' actions, complain to supervisors, and challenge the citation. 21Each of these situations is something that most troopers would like to avoid. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, it was reported that the NCSHP receives more complaints from whites ascompared to African Americans and Latinos. We pick up the same theme in our citizen focusgroups and our telephone survey. White focus group citizens tended to see any stop as anunnecessary intrusion and an unproductive use of police time. African American citizens tendedto acknowledge and accept responsibility for stops resulting from clear violations of traffic laws. This raised an auxiliary issue that compounds the problem of racial profiling: how does the coupling of expected resistance from a white person\u2014who may also be from a more affluentsegment of society that possibly harbors stereotypes of the minority community (such asperceived levels of law violations)\u2014impact the level and degree of disparity in stop outcomes? This coupling, intentionally or unintentionally, may produce deployment or locales ofenforcement that will serve only to increase disparity in traffic stops. It appears that while somedeployment decisions are based on traffic demands (for example, a road with a history ofaccidents or fatalities), others are based on areas w ith a significant \"opportunity\" factor. That is, opportunities associated with density of bars or other environmental factors (\"where the fishingis good\"). Such decisions are more likely to target low-income people (thus disproportionatelypeople of color) than their high-income counterparts. This is manifested with the presumptionthat they are less likely to challenge the action in court and that the higher income areas areinvolved in less overall criminality and disorder. While there was acknowledgment of the possibility of racial profiling in the NCSHP, it is generally believed to be an infrequent occurrence today but perhaps was a more frequentoccurrence in recent years past. They attributed the reduction in complaints to the dismantling22 the statewide drug interdiction units and reducing the competitive nature surrounding the quantity of drugs seized. 23Chapter 1 \"Driving While Black\" and the North Carolina Highway Study This project is a multi-method investigation of the phenomenon popularly referred to as \"driving while black.\" Cognate terms that refer to police behavior include \"racial profiling \" and \"racial targeting.\" The general social problem is the widespread perception that AfricanAmericans and other minorities are at increased risk of police stops compared to white drivers. A 1999 Gallup Poll found that 56 percent of whites and 77 percent of African Americansbelieved that racial profiling is widespread (Ga llup 1999). In our own survey of North Carolina drivers, 30 percent of whites and 80 percent of African Americans reported that they believedthat African Americans were more likely to be pulled over by the police than other drivers. \"Racial profiling\" and \"racial targeting\" refer to fairly specific police practices of using race as an explicit criterion for deciding which cars to stop or search. \"Driving while black \" is a less focused term, but summarizes a widespread belief in minority communities that they are singledout for harsher treatment than are white drivers. In designing this project we were faced with three associated issues. First, the actual degree and spatial/organizational distribution of racial disparity in stops are not known and current methodologies are inadequate for establishing scientifically reasonable estimates ofdisparity. This project develops and evalua tes a series of alternate methodologies for establishing the degree of racial disparity in stops. Second, the political attention to this complexphenomenon needs to be clarified with theoretical understandings of the various mechanismswhich plausibly could produce racial disparity in police stops. While \"racial profiling,\" the explicit use by police of race as an indicator of potential criminal status, might be one such mechanism, there is no reason to believe it is the only or even most general mechanism. For24policy, ending explicit racial profiling might do very little to reduce racial bias in police stops if other racially biased mechanisms produce racial disp arity in stops. It is also possible that other, not racially biased, mechanisms produce the observed racial disparity in stops. For example, ifpolice deployment in response to accident rates or calls for service increase police presence inminority neighborhoods this might lead to higher minority automobile stops as a function ofincreased patrols and contact. Third, regardless of the level or dispersion of ethnic disparity instops, the perception that \"driving while black\" places some community members at special risk represents a widespread threat to the legitimacy of law enforcement. This project combines demographic analyses, highway observations, surveys of citizens, focus groups with drivers, and focus groups with troopers to develop methodologies to estimateracial disparity in police stops, identify plausible mechanisms producing those disparities, andlearn about the consequences of perceptions of racial bias in policing for trust in the police. Thisproject began in 1999 when the North Carolina State Legislature mandated that the NorthCarolina State Highway Patrol (NCSHP), and all state law enforcement agencies, collect data onthe racial distribution of all vehicular stops initiated by officers. The NCSHP agreed tocooperate with us in a more thorough study of traffic stops and outcomes. The National Instituteof Justice funded this research. The cooperation of the NCSHP allowed us access to a great dealof demographic data on stops as well as cooperation in organizing focus groups with troopersand collecting observational data on North Carolina highways. In this introductory chapter we first present a brief review of current approaches to the problem of racial bias in traffic stops and sugge st that simple assumptions about the universality of police bias or lack thereof are unlikely to capture the reality of the situation. Instead weadvocate that if bias occurs, it occurs in the context of the work different police forces do, their25organizational practices, the immediate locality where individual officers patrol, and in interaction with citizens. This is followed by a theoretical elaboration of several mechanismsthat could plausibly produce racial differences in police stops. For example, one mechanismcould be average racial differences in driving be havior. Simple differences in racial composition of stops do not demonstrate the presence or absence of police bias. Rather, we should suspectracial bias only after accounting for racial/ethnic differences in driving behavior. On a practical level, what is most important in this regard is the racial distribution of drivers on the road. Whois driving and where they drive will vary dramatically from place to place as a function of racialdifferences in residence, employment, and driving destinations. We argue that, for policypurposes, estimates of racial disparity in police st ops adjusted for driving behavior are preferable to simple counts of the racial distribution of poli ce stops. A variety of approaches to establishing racial disparity are briefly discussed in this chapter. Finally, the chapter introduces the issue ofwhen and how minorities perceive police bias and the consequences of such perceptions for trustin law enforcement as an institution. The Work of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol Since much of this report focuses on the stop and search decisions of the NCSHP we begin with a description of the work done by the NCSHP. We wish to emphasize at the outsetthat this research did not arise out of a specific lawsuit or other accusation of gross racial bias by the NCSHP. Instead, this research was devel oped with the cooperation of the NCSHP who was willing to take the public risk of external research on the topic of racial bias in policing in orderto both facilitate the research and improve police practice.26Public attention is often focused on the NCSHP when they make a large drug bust or when a trooper loses her or his life in the perf ormance of duty, but the day-to-day reality of patrolling for most of the approximately 1,400 NC SHP troopers is one of responding to accidents and stopping vehicles that are speeding or are ot herwise in violation of safety laws, and then writing citations and warnings. This is occasionally dangerous but seldom glamorous work.NCSHP troopers generally carry themselves with a great deal of dignity; they keep their uniforms crisp and clean, wear their hats when approaching vehicles, and endeavor to treatcitizens politely but firmly. Making the highways safe is the primary and predominant functionof the NCSHP in North Carolina. In addition, a small special force of approximately twelve troopers is assigned primary responsibility for drug interdiction and identification of other typesof contraband. We will discuss this unit, the \"Criminal Interdiction Team\" in Chapter 4. For themost part we will be focusing on racial disparity and possible racial bias in the routine day-to- day activities of the NCSHP. Because the activity of the NCSHP is primar ily oriented toward vehicle-safety-related stops, about half of which are for speeding, the opportunities and motives for racial bias in policestops are probably small relative to other police forces that have both broader jurisdiction andenforcement goals. While troopers have some discretion in the decision to write a ticket, theinformation that generates speeding stops is mostly guided by race-blind radar devices. Racialstereotypes that associate minority status with criminality or drugs might be expected toencourage racial bias in policing, but most NCSHP troopers do little or no criminal or druginvestigation work. Still, traffic law enforcement is a combination of proactive and reactiveactivities. NCSHP troopers receive few 911 or other citizen initiated calls, relative to local lawenforcement, for example. This situation would seem to clearly increase the time available to27them to choose which citizens they encounter. But it is important to recognize that both citizen initiated calls for service and citizen initiated driving violations result in a reactive response frompolice. It is precisely the duality of traffic enforcement activities that is at the heart of the racialprofiling controversy: Do police stop only those whom they see or only that which they see? The major work of the NCSHP officer is stopping cars for traffic law violations. In Figure 1.1, the numbers of \"citation events\" handled by the NCSHP are presented by month forthe years 1997 through 2000. A citation event is an occasion in which a citation or multiplecitations are written. Several citations can be written at a stop or accident scene (an event). Since it is important for us to know about the composition of the drivers who are stopped,warned, cited, and so forth, in this report we will often be examining data on citation events. Here, and throughout most of the discussion in this and the next two chapters, we will befocusing on citation events when we refer to \"citations.\" In Figure 1.1 we see that the four-year average of citation events is approximately 52,000 per month (horizontal reference line), or approximately thirty-seven per month for each of 1,400troopers. Each year the NCSHP cites more than .5 million drivers in North Carolina (roughly500,000 to 650,000, varying by year). The citation rates were generally above the four-year 28 Figure 1.1 Trend in Citations, 1997-20001 In 1998, the NCSHP Statistics Web page shows that there were 1,056,049 \"preventive patrolling\" hours, compared to only 960,297 hours in 1999. In 2000, there were 1,064,283preventive patrolling hours. The number of hours investigating collisions in 1999 was also upfrom 1998 (276,190 versus 264,972 in 1998). Thus only a relatively small percentage of thereduction in the number of hours on patrol could be attributed to increased hours investigatingcollisions. 29average (1997-2000) prior to the summer of 1999, and below it afterwards, although for some months in 2000, the rate does rise to or above the average. At least a portion of the decline after1997 in the number of citations is probably due to the implementation of the NCSHP'simplementation of a Total Quality Management (TQM) plan intended to shift troopers' activitiesto focus on their core responsibility\u2014reducing accidents\u2014rather than the volume of citations. We will discuss TQM more below in our account of the focus groups with NCSHP troopers. The second, vertical, reference line highlights January, 2000, when Senate Bill 76, requiring NCSHP troopers to record all traffi c stops, went into effect. Senate Bill 76 was specifically concerned with the possibility of racial bias in police stops among state lawenforcement agencies, particularly in stops that did not result in a citation or written warning.Across 1999, there is a steep drop in citation activity. This is a period when the NCSHPpatrolling was the lowest in several years (NCSHP Statistics, 2001) (The NCSHP Web siteshows almost one-hundred-thousand fewer patrolling hours in 1999 than in 1998). 1 It was also the period of political discussions about racial bias and the drafting of legislation to require the NCSHP to collect new stop data and investigate the potential for racially biased policing. AfterJanuary, 2000, the frequency of citations seems to become stable around the four-year mean. Itappears that neither Senate Bill 76, nor the political and media attention to \"driving while black,\"influenced aggregate citation activity. It should be noted that the number of citation events willvary with the number of troopers working the highways, and we will have more to say about30that in subsequent chapters. Another interesting pattern we see from the graph is the seasonal effect. Here, the numbers of citation events decline during the fall, probably due to an increase inthe number of accidents during that time (see Figure 1.2). Accidents take up a considerableproportion of the troopers' time, leaving less shift time for general traffic enforcement that wouldresult in citations and warnings (written and verbal). The number of accidents that the NCSHP responded to and noted in accident reports for 1997-2000 is presented in Figure 1.2. There are numerous accidents, and reporting themconstitutes a significant proportion of the workdays of the NCSHP. The four-year average is approximately 9,900 accidents per month (horizontal reference line) or seven per officer per month. Looking at this reference line, we see that the accident rates seem to have the sameseasonal cycle over the four years, peaking every fall. As with the graph on citations, the secondreference line (vertical reference line) highlights January, 2000, when Senate Bill 76 wasinitiated. Unlike this reference line on Figure 1.1, this line does not mark any change in thepattern of accident rates. The main effects we see from the graph are seasonal effects. Many of the stops by the NCSHP do not result in citations, but in written warnings. In Figure 1.3 we see that the mean four-year average is approximately 24,500 warning events permonth (horizontal reference line). Looking at this reference line, we see that the warning rateswere generally above the four-year average prior to the summer of 1999, the time periodfollowing the implementation of the NCSHP's TQM program, wherein quality, not quantity of 31Figure 1.2 Trends in Accidents, 1997-2000 stops became a focus. Other than a much lower mean, this graph is almost identical to Figure 1.1 for citation events. At least some of the decline after 1997 in the number of warnings is due toTQM. The second reference line (vertical reference line) highlights January, 2000, when SenateBill 76, requiring NCSHP troopers to record their traffic stops, went into effect. This lineimmediately follows the lowest point in the number of warning events.32 Other than a much lower mean for written warnings, Figure 1.3 is almost identical to Figure 1.1 (of citation events). Thus, there is no need to repeat the discussion here of the trend. Note that there are fewer written warnings issued per month than citations. In Figure 1.3, we seethat the mean four-year average is approximately 24,500 warning events per month (horizontalreference line). Figure 1.3 Trends in Warnings, 1997-2000 In Figure 1.4, the number of \"consent searches\" (which here include probable cause searches as well as consent searches) per month is presented for the years 1997-2000. 33 There are far fewer searches conducted per month (sixty-five), of course, than citations and written warnings. Consequently, the pattern of the trend line is less stable. The volume ofsearches seems to have remained low since 1999, unlike the pattern observed for citations andwritten warnings. Thus, one could say that there has been a decline in the number of consent andprobable cause searches since the spring of 1999. Another interesting effect we see from the Figure 1.4 Trends in Searches, 1997-200034graph is the seasonal effect, but somewhat diffe rent from those observed earlier. Here, the number of search events increases during the summer months, perhaps reflective of increases inthe volume of traffic on the interstate highways (where many of the searches take place). In Chapter 5, we analyze survey data which allows us to compare in a preliminary way the degree of racial disparity and potential raci al bias in vehicle stops by the NCSHP and the many town, city, and county police officers also operating in North Carolina. The work of localpolice forces is typically different from the NCSHP. They respond to 911 calls for service moreoften, investigate criminal activity more often, typically have more knowledge of residentialareas and individuals in the community, and operate their patrol vehicles at far slower speeds. With the exception of 911 calls, all of these asp ects of local police work increase the potential for discretionary stops relative to the NCSHP. In addition, previous research has shown thatlarger police forces (Gardiner 1969) and state po lice forces (Mastrofski et al. 1987) tend to have more professional training. Some reports (see for example, Adams 2000; Parker 2001; Gaines2002) have tended to show large stop disparities by city and suburban police. Allegations ofracial bias by state police and highway patrol troopers have often focused on vehicle searches, where discretion is presumably higher and wh ere stereotypes about minority behavior may encourage searches for contraband. We report in Chapter 5, that even after accounting for racialdifferences in self-reported driving behavior, racial disparity in police vehicle stops is reported to be much higher among stops made by local officers than by members of the NCSHP. The vast majority of this report is about the NCSHP. We include a contrast with local police forces in part to emphasize that the analysis of racial bias in policing needs to take intoaccount the local context and content of actual police work. We develop in this chaptertheoretical tools for thinking about racial bias in police stops that may be more useful in35explaining bias processes in other settings. Similarly, we develop across this report a series of methodologies for examining bias processes. We expect that the methodologies will be usefullygeneralized to other contexts. We do not think it is reasonable to generalize any of our findings(except perhaps the findings regarding trust in the police) to other police forces or geographiccontexts. Our main contributions to the study of the \"driving while black\" phenomenon aretheoretical and methodological. Our substantive conclusions are mostly restricted to the activityof the NCSHP in the most recent years. The Importance of Process and Context During the course of this research we have been struck by the deterministic flavor of discussions of racial bias in policing. On the one hand, stakeholders who wish to raise awareness of racial bias in policing and the consequent distrust of police in the minority community, tend tolevel blanket charges of police bias with little attention to the source of the bias or to alternativesources of disparity in stops. All bias is the same and the assumption is if you look hard enoughyou will find it everywhere. We call this the lay theory of a racist society. In our focus groupswith African American citizens, we discovered that this lay theory of pervasive societal racismwas generally endorsed. Conversely, police officers and other stakeholders tend to dismiss the charge of pervasive racism, claiming they don't know any (or few) racists and that there areother good explanations for racial disparity in stops, such as not properly accounting for racial differences in who is actually on the road and breaking the law. White citizens we talked to alsoendorsed a more extreme lay theory in which racism was not the point: minority behaviorrequired more police attention and intervention. Proponents of both lay theories, when pressed,36often will point to \"bad apples\"\u2014that is, racist individual officers\u2014as the source of the problem, although they will disagree as to the pervasiveness of the amount of rot. From the viewpoint of social science, both lay theories seem quite misdirected. To argue that racial bias and racism are a unitary, pervasive phenomenon flies in the face of what weknow about racial bias and its consequences. To ar gue that there is no racial bias anywhere in a very large organization or across police forces is equally improbable. As we will outline belowthere are a number of racially biased mechanisms that may produce racial disparity in trafficstops. Self conscious, mean-spirited racism, while culturally the most recognizable, is by nomeans the most likely. It is also well known by social scientists who study organizational biasthat the degree of decision making discretion and policies that encourage and discourage biasvary across organizational contexts (Bielby 2000; Reskin 2000). It is simply not plausible to expect that racial bias will be produced in the same way or with the same intensity everywhere. Nor is it plausible to expect that it does not exist somewhere. Our discussion of the differencebetween the NCSHP and more locally-oriented police forces raised some of these issues. Wewill also investigate variation across the fift y-three troop districts within the NCSHP in the degree of racial disparity and potential racial bias. We think that one of the most importantcontributions this project may make is to clar ify the variety of bias producing mechanisms we might encounter and the importance of organizational context and policies for encouraging ordiscouraging racial bias. Racial bias in polic ing is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon. Instead, it is a series of questions about how and where bias is a problem.37Non-Bias Mechanisms that Could Produce Racial Disparity in Stops The simple observation of a racial disparity in police stops or searches is not sufficient evidence to support accusations of racial bias in policing. Conversely, a finding that minoritydrivers are stopped or searched by police in numbers roughly proportional to their incidence inthe population cannot be used to rule out the possibility of biased police stops. We define bias inpolice stops as disproportionally stopping, citing, or searching minority drivers given their incidence in the population of offending drivers encountered by police. This definition, assumesthat it is police discretion as to who is stopped (cited, searched) which potentially generatesracial or ethnic bias in the distribution of stops. Since the bias is an interaction between officers' discretion and the drivers available to stop, a suspicion of racial bias requires us to first developestimates of who is at risk to be stopped and where the officers actually patrol before consideringexplanations of racially biased policing. In most places we expect to encounter relatively large average racial and ethnic differences in driving behavior. The most importa nt reason for these racial differences in driving behavior is locational. That is, there are very large African American-white, and Hispanic-whitedifferences in residence patterns, reflecting histor ical patterns of residential segregation (Massey and Denton 1993). Although, not much is known about its spatial distribution, there are alsowell known patterns of racial/ethnic employmen t segregation (Tomaskovic-Devey 1993). Since we know that in most regions of the country the average white and minority citizens live insegregated neighborhoods and work in different orga nizations we can be fairly sure that in most places the racial composition of drivers in different places (neighborhoods, highway segments, main versus local streets) will be highly variable. Since we have no reason to believe that policepatrol streets randomly and proportional to popula tion, a city or state level ethnic disparity in2 Note however that our observational study is of a non-random sample of observed drivers on four-lane highways, and one should not generalize the findings to all types oflocations. 38police stops may simply reflect the racial composition of roads that police patrol. This cuts both ways, observing that African Americans are st opped less than their proportion in the population does not necessarily imply an absence of racial bias. Rather, African Americans simply may bedriving less in those places where police patrol more. Where people drive is obviously related to both the locations of where they live and their likely destinations (such as where they work or where they travel to for shopping). How muchpeople drive is obviously related to how far they must go to get places they need to be, but alsoto other factors which may be related to race. Outside of the South, the United States AfricanAmerican and Hispanic populations tend to live in more urban areas on average relative towhites. This simple residential difference will have implications for the degree of reliance onautomobiles and mass transit. In urban areas especially, simple comparisons of those stopped tominority and majority population proportions may be quite different from the actual racial/ethnic distribution of drivers on the road. There may also be racial/ethnic differences in the driving behaviors that are likely to place one most at risk of a traffic stop. Some recent evidence in New Jersey suggests that onsome highways at some times of day, African Americans are more likely to break the speed limitat higher speeds than white drivers (Lange, Blackman and Johnson 2001). Our own research atfourteen sites indicates that African Americans speed disproportionately. 2 We know of no other research at this time that suggests that this is the case. These preliminary observations must be cautiously examined. The minority population is slightly younger on average than the white population in many places. Since it is well known39that young drivers engage in more risky driving beha viors, racial differences in the age structure might lead to small average racial differences in risky driving behavior. On the other hand, because of widespread fear of bias by the police in the minority community, we might expectminorities to drive more carefully than whites. Since so much of social life is organized orassociated with race, it is not unreasonable to assume that, at least in some localities, there maybe average racial/ethnic differences not only in where and how much people drive, but also how they drive. There is no reason, however, to assume, a priori, that it is minority drivers who tendto be worse drivers. It could quite reasonably be white drivers, secure in their privilege to driveas they wish, who are more frequently the risky drivers. It is our expectation that racial differences in where people drive and how much they drive (because of their strong links to residence and income) will be much greater than racialdifferences in the use of seatbelts, turn signals, or excessive speed. One of the primarycontributions of this project is to develop a series of methodologies for examining the spatialdistribution, density, and driving behaviors of driv ers at risk to be stopped. Another contribution is that discussions of racial disparity in po licing require a good faith effort to account for non- discriminatory sources of racial disparity in stops associated with driving behavior before reaching a conclusion that a particular police for ce is guilty of racial profiling in traffic stops.40Deployment and Patrol Patterns Police deployment may produce absolutely no racial disparity in police stop decisions, but a large racial disparity in stops. Deployment refers to where police patrol and concentratetheir activities. Deployment for crime control, for example, tends to be greatest in higher crimeneighborhoods. If higher crime neighborhoods tend to have larger minority communities, minorities might be stopped for traffic offenses at higher rates, simply because as a group theyhave a higher probability of encountering an o fficer. A similar pattern might hold if state troopers were deployed and concentrated their effo rts in areas for reasons unrelated to race (for example, areas with higher accident rates) but those areas tended to have more AfricanAmericans routinely traveling these specific areas. This latter example is less plausible on itsface, but the general point is that who gets stopped reflects, in many ways, where the police aredeployed. It is possible for deployment to generate more minority (or majority) stops than theirincidence in the population. Because residential segregation and employment segregation tendto be powerful forces in most places, we strongly believe that studies of racial bias in policing must be able to adjust for deployment patterns. If police are deployed specifically to harass African American drivers, deployment could be influenced by a bias process at the organizational level. We suspect that it is more likely thatpolice deployment is intended to reflect public safety goals such as crime prevention or highwaysafety. In this project we find that the racial composition of accidents is a useful tool with which to identify the racial composition of drivers at risk for stops, but the figures must be adjusted for police deployment by location and time of day to be most useful.41References for Chapter One Adams, Jim. 2000.

This seemingly simple question is not easily answered. As researchers, our goal is touncover indications of possible racial bias, yet we have no data on the motives of individual troopers who may or may not be biased in their behavior. Overt racism is seldom admitted to,and thus, evidence of possible racial bias must be gleaned from a statistical analysis of the behavior of troopers. As we will see, this evidence, while allowing us to rule out some claimsabout the prevalence of bias, is equivocal about others. We separate two forms of NCSHP behavior relevant to the questions of bias: the deployment of troopers to a district (are some districts with relatively many African Americans \"over\" patrolled?) and the behavior of individual troopers toward citizens (Are the behaviors ofindividual troopers race neutral?). We take up the first question in this chapter and the second inthe following chapter. The analysis of race-specific rates of stops/citations across areas that we address in this chapter is important in two ways. First, these areal or aggregate rates can be used to studypatterns of stop/citation disparity. 3 If an NCSHP district, for example, has an unusually high rate of citations or stops of African Americans, it ma y indicate organizational practices in that district43which need to be corrected. These practices may range from a seemingly benign decision to patrol one highway more than another because of tradition (\"we always patrol there becausethere are a lot of speeders there\"\u2014 and more African Americans happen to drive there, drivingup the rate of African American stops in a dist rict), to policy that possibly involves targeting highways because of the racial composition (troopers are deployed because a highway is knownto have many African American drivers). In such a case, disparity may be reduced or eliminatedby simply changing deployment patterns, or making deployment patterns more rationally based(patrol where preventable accidents occur) rather than based on tradition. A second importance of areal analysis is that, as researchers, we cannot evaluate how troopers behave individually without knowing about the contexts in which they work. For example, a trooper working in the predominantly white counties of western North Carolinawould not be expected to have the same rate of stops of African Americans as a trooper in thecounties in eastern North Carolina, where relatively many African Americans live. If we canascertain that a district does not have an excess number of African Americans stopped/cited, thenwe have a baseline against which to compare the behavior of individual troopers. In the organization of this report, this chapter explores whether there are any patterns of excessive stops/citations of African Americans at the area level. Where there are no differencesin stops/citations, or where the range of disparity is small (or within the range of measurementerror), we have, as a result of this comparison, established a baseline against which to judge thebehavior of individual troopers (this latter task we leave for the next chapter). For example, ifwe know that 23 percent of the drivers speeding on the highways in an area are AfricanAmerican, and that 23 percent of the drivers cited for speeding on the highways of an area areAfrican American, then we have one base rate (later we will discuss others) against which to44evaluate individual troopers. That is, we can reasonably take the next step to see if there are specific troopers who have an excessively high pe rcentage of their citations for speeding issued to African Americans. If an entire geographic area has an excessively high rate of citations ofAfrican Americans, however, then we will need to adjust our estimates to account for this fact when evaluating individual trooper behavior. (We will address this issue in greater detail in thenext chapter). Theories of Racial Disparity Previous research has generally been focuse d on individual officer bias. As discussed in the first chapter, individual officers may make d ecisions (to stop, to issue a citation) that are racially motivated (active, racial animus) or make decisions that represent cognitive bias(officers are unaware that they give the benefit of the doubt to whites more than AfricanAmericans). What is called organizational bias or \"institutional racism\" (alternatively,\"institutionalized racial bias\") also can be at work. The term has several different meanings, andcan include any organizational policy that has an adverse effect on African Americans,irrespective of the basis or rationale for the policy. We find it helpful to differentiate policies(organizational decisions) that may have racial bias as its motivational origin from those that donot have such a motivational source, but which nevertheless have adverse consequences forAfrican Americans. We argue that there can be three types of such \"unconscious\" bias at theorganizational level: 1) cognitive bias, 2) irrational incidental bias, and 3) rational incidental bias (some may prefer the term \"disparity\" to \"bias\" here). As an example of cognitive bias at the organizational level, suppose it were found that troopers over-patrolled a given stretch of highway because the local sergeant believes that there45are \"numerous bad drivers\" on that stretch of highway. But he or she (and presumably others in the Troop) may have formed that view based in part on the observation that there aredisproportionately high numbers of African Am ericans usually found driving that specific highway who contribute to the high number of \"bad drivers\" (white and African American). In other words, unconscious bias against African Americans could lead to a labeling process(labeling an area or stretch of highway) resulti ng in over-patrolling of that stretch of highway. \"Organizational cognitive bias\" is distinguished from individual cognitive bias as the latter refersto possible bias of an individual trooper. As an example of irrational incidental bias, suppose it were found that troopers tend to patrol a given stretch of highway because \"it is easier to catch speeders there,\" but that samestretch of highway is where, coincidently, there are a disproportionate number of African American drivers (we say \"coincidently\" because we are not implying that troopers are aware ofthere being a disproportionate number of African American drivers speeding). Again, stops and citations of African Americans for the area may be excessively high due to the over-patrolling ofthis stretch of highway. Reducing the patrolling of this highway would result in fewer African Americans stopped/cited and could reduce/eliminate racial disparity in the area. The \"over-\"stopping or citing of African Americans, in this case, is not related to any racial bias of a cognitive sort (nor motivational source, for that matter), and it is easily corrected by limiting thepatrolling of that stretch of highway. The third type of organizational decision that can generate racial disparity is one that is not racially motivated, and which nevertheless affects African Americans in an adverse manner(we assume that more citations and stops are \"adverse\"), but which is justified on the basis ofrational principles of organizational action. For example, if it were the case that Highway A,46with disproportionately many African Americans, had substantially more accidents than Highway B, thereby justifying the allocation of a higher proportion of patrols to Highway A, then the consequence for African Americans would appear as a form of racial disparity, but one incidental to the rational allocation of troopers to that highway. We refer to this as \"rationalincidental disparity.\" Since we have no data on the motives of organizational actors (organizational decision makers), and differences in the patterns of NCSHP troopers' behaviors are often small, we willmost times not be in a position to interpret the data as being more consistent with oneexplanation than another. Is disparity due to cognitive bias, irrational incidental bias, or rationalincidental bias? Sometimes, however, we will be able to weigh the evidence that is available tosee whether for specific findings one explanation is more consistent with those findings than another, or perhaps only more plausible. As mentioned, we do not have direct measures of the motivations of individual troopers or of Troop captains or sergeants. As such, as stated above, it will generally be the case thatevidence of racial disparity cannot be interpreted unequivocally as bias. Nevertheless, despitepossible ambiguity, organizations need to respond to the possibility that disparity and possiblediscrimination may exist. For example, it is possible that everyday deployment decisions by theNCSHP, even if made without any conscious im plication of race, could have profound impacts on the racial composition of drivers who are stopped and cited. For example, suppose there areonly two highways in a county and they have equal traffic volume. Because of patterns ofactivity between residence, work, and recreation, 30 percent of Highway A's drivers are AfricanAmerican, while only 20 percent of Highway B's dr ivers are African American. The average for the county would be 25 percent (the average of 30 and 20). If 25 percent of those cited in the47county were African American, one could conclude that there is no evidence of racial disparity. But what if, say, 28.5 percent of those cited were African American? That presumably would be defined as a racial disparity worthy of further investigation (in other words, 3.5 percent higher African American citation rate than the base rate). The evidence of a 3.5 percent difference could be interpreted as follows: at the individual level, NCSHP troopers (acting alone) make eith er or both biased decisions to cite African Americans (racial animus) or racially unconscious decisions to let whites go with unreportedwarnings (cognitive bias). But there is another plausible interpretation: deployment can beunequal. That is, the difference in allocation could be accounted for statistically by deploymentof patrols to highways where African Americans are known to drive, or the deployment ofpatrols at times of the day when African Americans are more likely to be driving. If this werethe case, the various forms of organizational bias discussed above might be the appropriateinterpretation. If the excessive deployment of tr oopers to Highway A is justified by a perception of the highway as a \"problem highway\" then organizational cognitive bias may be at work. If itwere found that troopers patrol a highway because \"the fishing is better there\" (violators areeasier to find), then what we call \"irrational incidental bias\" may be operative. If there has beena rash of accidents on Highway A, triggering a de ployment decision that 70 percent of the patrol time is devoted to Highway A, while only 30 percent is spent on Highway B, then perhapsrational incidental disparity is operating. For the county in question, a citation rate of 28.5percent for African Americans could be in part a consequence of the deployment decision (whichhad been made for non-race-related reasons). Without knowledge of the fact that Highways Aand B differ both in the amount of patrolling a nd in the proportions of their drivers who are African Americans, a researcher might mistakenly interpret the 28.5 percent as evidence of48individual troopers' racial bias, instead of a consequence of a non-racially motivated deployment decision. Suppose the situation were different and the sergeant deployed 70 percent of the patrolling to Highway A because his or her perception was that there were a lot of AfricanAmericans speeding on Highway A and \"those people\" needed to be stopped and cited. It would be unlikely that we, as researchers, would have access to information of such explicit bias of thissort (here, overt racial animus). Except for some very specific instances that have gainednational attention because of the litigation process, there is seldom \"smoking gun\" evidence inracial bias research. Yet, the deployment deci sion in this hypothetical example was in fact a racially motivated and biased decision with arguably negative consequences for AfricanAmericans (excessive number of stops and citations compared to what would have been the caseif a racially neutral decision had been made). For these reasons, we have to be cautious ininterpreting the patterns of data on stops and citations. Any evidence of disparity requiresfurther analysis and scrutiny. At the same time, it is difficult to determine when disparity shouldbe interpreted as bias. The real life situations of patrolling and citizen driving are far more complicated than described above. Troopers of the NCSHP typically have a great deal of discretion concerning where they patrol in a given hour of a given day, so that even if there was a directive of the firstsergeant to focus patrols on Highway A, there is no guarantee that such a decision would befollowed. There are several reasons for the discretion. So called \"micro-managing troopers\" hasnot been a tradition in highway patrolling, presumably because it would be time consuming toadminister. Someone would essentially have to dispatch troopers and verify that they have notleft a given highway. Patrol cars are generally mobile. From our conversations with NCSHP49troopers, they perceive themselves as more effective if their vehicles are mobile because they are more likely to come upon unsuspecting motorists violating the law. Factors such as the \"goodfishing\" principle may be operating: troopers cite drivers in locations where they havehistorically found speeders and other violators to be plentiful. From the focus group data collected for this project, we learned that troopers go where violations are plentiful not because they have quotas to fill, but because they have citations andwritten warnings to write as evidence of their productivity. Presumably they also go to whereaccidents are plentiful. But the two are not always highly correlated. For example, a very busyinterstate highway may have relatively few accidents per vehicular miles driven, yet manyspeeders. Since speeding (frequent event) is presumably only moderately correlated withaccidents (rare events), there must be locations where speeding occurs but few accidents (forexample, a straight-away), and other areas where there are many accidents but little speeding(sharp curve or steep incline). Furthermore, the stopping and citing of drivers may be due to thefact that an area is within a short range of a ma jor intersection such that drivers speed up as they drive away from that intersection, violating the speed limit by an excessive amount as they settlein on a comfortable speed for that highway. Data we have examined as to the location of stopssuggests that troopers have a tendency to stop drivers within a mile or two of major intersections(of interstate highways). Whether it is because drivers are driving faster there or the trooperschoose these areas for other reasons (an intersection is a convenient turn-around place) is notknown, but we suspect that both citizen behavi or and the \"fishing principle\" are operating. As stated above, the general problem that we face as researchers is that data on possible racial motivation is generally not available, only data on stops, citations and accidents. Someinference need be drawn on the possibly biased nature of organizational responses from the50patterns of these data. One of the specific problems a patrol organization faces is that decisions by lieutenants and sergeants that affect deployment of patrol cars are likely to not always bebased on accident data, but rather on partially subjective evaluations of accident patterns. Somesubjectivity is probably necessary, since the type of accidents, their presumed causes and so forthought to be taken into consideration. A second problem they face is the fact that the individualtrooper is generally free (and, to some extent, required given staff shortages) to roam a ratherlarge area while patrolling and the specific locations are chosen at his or her discretion. Thus,patrolling is unlikely to ever be fully rational, as the trooper's beliefs and ideas of what are\"good fishing\" areas will almost inevitably come into play. Thirdly, when troopers in patrol carsstop drivers in heavy traffic, they can be inadvertent causes of accidents. Thus, some of the mostheavily trafficked areas may be \"under-patrolled\" for fear of causing more of a problem than isnecessary. For all these reasons, the correlation of accidents and the volume of patrolling islikely to be attenuated (less than perfect). Methodological Issues Keeping in mind our two goals of studying aggregate units of analysis to inform our subsequent individual-level analysis and identifying areas where racial disparity is mostpronounced, we next turn our attention to several methodological issues. First, we as researchers do not have direct measures of routine citizen-driver behavior. As a consequence, we mustexamine patterns among variables that stand as \"proxies\" (approximate measures) for citizendriver behavior. Some measurement error pertains to these proxy measures. These proxymeasures include the number of resident licensed drivers in a district, an estimate of the number4 More specifically, \"drivers driving\" refers to a statistical estimate of the racial composition of the drivers in an area, based on the aggregate racial composition of the area inwhich a driver who has been cited resides. This is discussed in greater detail elsewhere in thisreport. 51of what we call \"drivers driving\" in a district, 4 and the number of individuals in accidents (we will look at accidents reported by the NCSHP and by other agencies). We also have collectedinformation at fourteen sites on speeding behavior of drivers. The data from these sites can helpus validate the proxy variables, that is, help us determine how much measurement error there isacross the proxy measures. Appendix A discusses the speeding study of the fourteen sites. Another methodological problem we have to address is how substantial a statistical difference is necessary before we consider an area to have an excessive number of AfricanAmerican stops/citations. When dealing with stops/citations, there are hundreds of thousands ofthese events involving the NCSHP in North Carolina each year. It is not a given that astatistically significant difference is a meaningful difference. Also, differences can be attributed to measurement error. For example, if 23 percen t of the drivers speeding in an area are African American and 22 percent of the drivers cited fo r speeding are African American, we must ask if that difference can be attributed to measurement error (in this case most likely in our estimate ofAfrican Americans speeding) or not (is there actually \"reverse discrimination\"?). Secondly, even if the difference is not attributed to measurement error, we must decide whether thedifference is \"actionable.\" That is, should a policy decision reasonably be based on the observeddifferences that we find? These are complex issues, and we offer suggestions as to how toproceed toward resolving them. 52The Importance of Context As we have indicated above, to assess the presence and extent of racial disparity in an organization such as a highway patrol, it is useful to distinguish methodologically betweenindividual trooper behavior and the context or environment in which the trooper works. Weclaim that without understanding the context of the trooper's work, one cannot evaluatestatistical evidence that measures the individual trooper's behavior. In the example discussedabove, a trooper working in the predominantly white, western counties of North Carolina wouldbe expected, all else equal, to have a lowe r proportion of African Americans among his or her citations than a trooper patrolling in the predominantly urban counties, which in North Carolinahave relatively large African American populations. But variation in context occurs withinrelatively small areas, such as a county. For example, a patrol of a highway near thepredominantly white suburb of Cary in Wake County would be expected to yield a relatively lowpercentage of African Americans issued citations, compared to a highway on the east side ofWake County, outside of a predominantly African American residential section of the city of Raleigh. Very \"local\" factors may also be relevant to the racial make up of a troopers's citations. The presence of a textile plant with predominantly African American employees wouldpresumably have an influence on the percentage of citations issued to African Americans on ahighway near the plant. Similarly, the presence of a bar where African Americans recreate andconsume alcohol would affect the \"driving under the influence\" rate for African Americans on the highway near the location of the bar. Organi zational factors, such as a sergeant's decision to \"crack down\" on DUI driving on a highway where th e \"African American bar\" is located, also can affect the rate of DUI citations (and arrests), generally, and the African American rates,53specifically, for the district. Thus, the volume a nd often type of behavior that police observe or come into contact with will vary, depending on where the patrolling occurs. Another set of factors can influence the rate s of stops/citations of African Americans. Our analysis below reveals that the representativeness of African Americans on the highways isdifferent at different times of the day, and different from that of whites. Our initial evidence ofthis was surprising to us, and so we looked for confirming evidence in the literature and foundthat the 1995 National Transportation Survey conf irms our findings that African Americans are disproportionately to be found on the highway in the evening and nighttime hours (relative towhite drivers). Also, we discovered that the NCSHP does not work the highways evenly acrossthe hours of the day, and that the number of patrols vary across the state. Essentially, there ismore patrolling at night in the more urban or heavily driven areas (especially where theinterstates pass through) and less patrolling in the rural areas. The possibility of a mismatchbetween when drivers are on the highway and when troopers are on the highway needs beaddressed. The issues are complicated because it is conceivable that some decisions aboutdeployment are themselves not racially neutral. For example, if there is an excessive number ofAfrican Americans issued citations because there is an \"excessive amount\" of patrolling at night,a reasonable question is \"why?\" The answer may or may not be racially neutral. We willdiscuss this possibility again further below. Citation Zones One further issue will be developed which we did not anticipate when we began this research and which seems to have a profound impact on the rate at which drivers are stopped. Itis essentially similar to the \"the speed trap.\" We prefer to use the term citation zone as we54imply by that term something more than a trooper hiding his or her patrol vehicle behind a bush or in a ditch to catch speeders, but rather use the term generically to refer to an area of a highwaywhere many citations are issued. Also, we imply by the term \"citation zone\" that other behaviorsare looked for besides speeding, such as failures to stop, yield, weaving or other unsafe driving, or perhaps simply expired automobile tags. By using the term citation zone, we want to capturethe idea that patrols tend to work certain stretches of a highway (a specific mile or several milesof highway), presumably because \"the fishing is good there\" \u2014 in other words, there are manyspeeders or other violators, and the highway design may be conducive to making stops (for example, the highway has broad shoulders to safely pull over vehicles). If these citation zonesaccount statistically for a large proportion of the stops/citations, then very local conditions andcircumstances are crucial to understanding the stop/citation rate of an area. For example, wenotice that there tends to be a high rate of citation activity near major intersections, indicative ofheavy patrolling of those areas. Why the high rate? The most probable explanation is that ascars accelerate coming from an intersection they often exceed the speed limit. One might evensay it is a natural tendency to speed up as one enters onto a highway from another highway. Also, as one leaves a city or town where one has been driving more slowly \u2014 in accordancewith slower speed limits \u2014 one may tend to accelerate to a speed well above the limit (the vastmajority of drivers on major highways speed at some level). Perhaps the \"liberating\" effect ofthe \"open road\" represents a form of psychological \"release.\" Troopers may have learned thatthese are good locations to pick up speeders (and collaterally, other violators) because \"thefishing is good\" and the landscape is suitable for a stop. The racial distribution of stops in a district can be influenced by the choice of where to look for drivers. If the citation zone is near a residential area that is mostly African American, or it is near a factory where African Americans55make up a high percentage of the labor force, the stop rate of African Americans will be high for that district or county. Our point about what we call the citation zone is that they can unduly \"tip\" the statistics in the larger geographic area in which they are embedded. That is, an area which statisticallymay not show evidence of racial disparity, may do so based on one \"citation zone\" that happensto be located where African Americans frequently drive (alternatively, the speed trap is locatedthere for racially motivated reasons). In either case, the location of the speed trap is an importantpart of understanding the explanatory mechanisms by which racial disparity evidence isgenerated. Spatial Heterogeneity At a more abstract level, one of the predominant issues that we have to address in this chapter is that of \"spatial heterogeneity\" (also known as geographic heterogeneity) - a fancyterm for the simple mismatch between when and where patrolling occurs and when/wheredriving occurs as these phenomena are measured across geographic areas. If troopers patrolmore frequently at night in one district than troopers in another district, and African Americans drive more at night in both districts, the former will have a higher percentage of AfricanAmerican stops/citations than the latter. If troopers choose citation zones near areas withrelatively high numbers of African American dr ivers, the percent of stops involving African Americans for the whole district may be affecte d. In both instances, race may or may not have something to do with the deployment decision, and we must consider that possibility in theanalysis and interpretation of our data.56Proxy Measures of Citizen Behavior One of the key issues to the study of racial disparity is that there is seldom any direct \u2014 much less error-free \u2014 measure of the behavior of the citizens driving on the highways where the troopers patrol. If one wants to know if the troopers issue an excessive number of citationsto African Americans in an area, enforcement must be gaged relative to the prevalence ofviolating behavior of African Americans where the troopers are patrolling. Depending on the county, area of the county, and local features on a highway, the presence of African Americans, as well as their violating behaviors, may vary. The most difficult issue faced by researchers is to assess the adequacy of measures to approximate the behavior of citizens so as to have a basis forcomparison. For example, if one knows that 25 percent of the \"threshold speeders\" on ahighway are African American, then we would expect that 25 percent of the citations for speeding would be written to African Americans. (A \"threshold speeder\" could be defined as a speeder who is traveling at a speed that usually triggers a stop and citation by the NCSHP on thatspecific highway.) Lacking a measure of the thre shold speeding behavior of drivers, a researcher must look for alternative measures. Such measures could seem rather crude, such as estimates ofthe proportion of drivers in an area who are African American or white. For example, censusdata, or data from the state Division of Motor Ve hicles on the addresses of licensed drivers could be used to estimate what percent of the eligible drivers in an area are African American. Underthe assumption that whites and African Americans violate traffic laws to the same extent anddegree, and do so where the NCSHP troopers can see them, such measures would constituteadequate proxy measures of behavior (further assumptions could be made about out of state drivers or drivers from other areas within the state). If, however, there is variation in the5 It would be naive to assume that it has been \"business as usual\" for the NCSHP since implementation of the special stop data collec tion. From our conversations with troopers, we know that they are well aware of the public and legal scrutiny to which their behavior is subject. 57distribution of traffic violating behavior across races and across the locations where the patrols occur, or variation in the levels of travel from ot her areas of the state or out of state, then these resident-based proxy measures might prove to be inadequate. Command Policy and Procedures In addition to examining our data at the aggregate level to measure characteristics of the contexts in which troopers work, we also study at the aggregate level to gain information on thenature of the local command policies and procedures as they impact the racial composition ofdrivers stopped, cited or warned. Some sergeants may promote the issuing of citations, whileothers promote the idea of deterring through presence on the highway (particularly highwayswhere accidents in general or specific types of accidents occur). The implications for race arenot obvious, but if a push for a high volume of citations happens to occur on highways useddisproportionately by African Americans, then that district may appear to have an excessively high rate of such citations. Yet, the statistical disparity is but an artifact of a possibly arbitrary decision at to where to patrol intensively. Of c ourse it is also possible that the decision to patrol more intensively is itself racially motivated. We will also discuss that possibility below. Other command policies or practices in place may have the effect of lowering the rate of citations of African Americans. 5 For example, troopers have reported to us that citations are reviewed each week to monitor the racial distributi on of that activity. Presumably the intent is to identify some number that represents \"too many\" and a trooper who is found to cite consistentlya high percentage of African Americans would be called upon to account for this. If this58managerial decision has a real impact, it might lead troopers to be cautious in their personal citation rates of African Americans. We can only imagine what strategies a trooper woulddevise to avoid any possible reprimand. For example, a trooper may \"look the other way\" forsome African American drivers so as not to come close to the acceptable proportion of AfricanAmerican citations. Or he or she may avoid cita tions of African Americans early in the week so as to have the option open for him or her to cite African Americans in the latter part of the week,should a particularly serious offense be obs erved. We do not know about these possible individual adaptations. However, it should be me ntioned that we are unlikely to find any trooper with extremely high rates of citations of Afri can Americans due to these weekly accounting procedures (however, we suspect that these are unevenly applied and are not systematicallyadministered). Aggregate Units of Analysis To evaluate the behavior of the NCSHP at the aggregate level, it is necessary to discuss levels of aggregation (county, district, or altern ative areal measures) that warrant study. There are only five aggregate units of analysis that seem relevant to our study. Starting with thelargest, there are the eight regional Patrol Tr oop Areas (each covering about one eighth of the state). The second largest is the Patrol Distri ct Area (there are 53 NCSHP districts). A patrol district is usually made up of one to two counties. The third largest unit is the county (100counties state wide). Fourth is the county area level (roughly one third of a county), an area thatthe NCSHP uses to locate citations in a subarea of a county. Last is what we call a highwayarea, defined as a stretch of highway between the borders of a county area. Although there isvirtually no limit to how areas could be defined, (for example, a researcher might define an area6 That is, we propose comparing the propor tion of accident involved drivers who are African American with the proportion of those cited who are African American. 59as one side of a highway between intersections), there is little practical reason for looking at citations or citizen behavioral proxy measures for areas that are extremely small because thereare too few observations of trooper intervention to study statistically over a short time span of ayear or even three or four years. Figure 2.1 shows how the units of aggregation differ. For analysis purposes we will largely stick to two or three levels of analysis, using the highway areafor some of the analysis, the 53 patrol district areas (PDA) for other analysis, and - forpresentation purposes - the eight regional patrol troop areas (PTA). There are tradeoffs with the choice of a unit of aggregation. At the most micro level studied here (highway area) we argue that there is less measurement error introduced due to whatwe call \"spatial heterogeneity\" (essentially the mismatch between where troopers patrol andwhere drivers drive within an area). At the same time there is more measurement error of othertypes at the highway area level. Because highway areas are quite small, there will bemeasurement error attributable to relatively small numbers of observations (for example, fewaccidents may occur and few citations may be awarded in that particular stretch of highway). There are many reasons for measurement error that we can only imagine, and they probably varywith the type of data collected. For accident data, which we propose as a measure of a baselineagainst which to compare the citation rates of African Americans, 6 troopers may have the option of letting another law enforcement agency (county sheriff or local municipal police) write up and record the accident report. The data we have on the number of accidents reported per countyindicate that it is primarily the NCSHP who is responsible for handling the write up of accidentsin counties (and not, for example, the county sheriff's office), except in those counties with large60cities. In the more urban counties, a large proportion of the accidents will be written up by the local (city) police. It is not obvious what this means in these urban counties for the rates ofAfrican Americans cited when compared to th e rates of accidents involving African Americans. Figure 2.1 NCSHP District (2 counties)County County AreasSegment of Highway Within County Area'Highway Areas'Four Possible Aggregate Units of Analysis7 This is plausible, assuming greater African American participation in the service industry, for example. 61It might mean, for example, that if a high pr oportion of African Americans in urban counties have their accidents written up by the local police (perhaps because African Americans driveproportionately more within the city than around the city), 7 then the proportion of accidents recorded by NCSHP involving African American drivers outside of the city limits may berelatively low. Accident rates are generally lo wer on large, four-lane highways, relative to the number of miles driven on those roads. Yet, speeding may be more prevalent on the large, four-lane highways - leading the NCSHP to cite the speeders there, even if the number of accidents per million miles driven is relatively low. Stops, Citations and Written Warnings By Race Bearing in mind these methodological issues, we begin to address the question of the extent of racial disparity by presenting the br eakdown of stops, citations, and written warnings of drivers by reason for the citation. We show a breakdown by type of behavior in part to makeclear what are the primary responsibilities of the NCSHP. The NCSHP works the highways primarily to stop, cite and warn drivers for driving misbehavior so as to make the highwayssafer. Unlike the local or city police, the primary mission of the NCSHP is to ensure safehighways\u2014 most directly through the enforcement of North Carolina traffic law. It is not tocontrol, limit, and \"fight crime\" as crime is traditionally defined (such as robbery, burglary,larceny, or assault). Only a small fraction of the NCSHP\u2014in recent years approximately twelvetroopers\u2014 has as its primary purpose the task of screening drivers for suspicion of transportingillegal contraband. As can be seen in Table 2.1, the most common form of behavior that triggers8 We present data on stops here even though we know that a high percentage of stops seem to be \"missing\" or at least not in the data base that we have available to us (roughly a thirdof the records seem fall into that category -- partly due to lack of stop data on checkpoint stops). Later in the analysis we will focus on citations and written warnings, as they seem to constitute amore complete data base. 9 Note here that the base for the percentage calculation is all white and African American drivers, excluding all others. Also note that 21.1 is within one percentage point of other baselinedenominators such as percentage of drivers in accidents who are African American or percent ofour estimate of \"drivers driving\" who are African American - described elsewhere in the report. 62a NCSHP trooper response is vehicular speeding. Data are presented for the year 2000, the year the NCSHP began to collect data on all of their vehicular stops (relatedly, see Appendix C on thecharge likely to be the reason for the stop). There are several interesting aspects of Table 2.1. First, the NCSHP stops and cites many drivers over the course of time, as was pointed out in Chapter 1. 8 More than .5 million citations were issued in 2000 (the licensed driver population of North Carolina is approximately 6.5million), resulting in roughly one citation issued for every fourteen North Carolina drivers (somemore than once, so the prevalence of citations is somewhat less than one in fourteen). As for theracial breakdown of the citations, stops, and written warnings, we can compare initially theresults to the overall percentage of drivers with licenses who are African American, which is21.2 percent of all of the white and African American drivers. 9 As can be seen in the table, 24.7 percent of all those stopped are African American, so there is some evidence of racial disparityin this simple comparison (3.5 percent absolute difference between 24.7 and 21.2 percent). Thedifference is slightly greater for citations (3.7 percent), and lower for written warnings (2.5percent). As such, the results in Table 2.1 tell us a lot about the extent of possible NCSHP racial disparity state-wide. We can rule out the possibility of large scale racial bias against African10 The relatively higher odds of an African American being stopped (16.5 percent) should also be interpreted with caution because the proportion of African American amonglicensed drivers is a small percentage - only 21.2 percent. As the denominator in any ratiobecomes smaller, very large relative odds can be generated. For example, take the findings forwhites in the same table: 75.3 percent of the whites and African Americans stopped are whites,compared to 78.8 percent of the licensed drivers. The -3.5 percent difference (75.3-78.8)represents a relatively lower rate of being stopped of -4.4 percent. To say that whites have arelatively lower rate of being stopped (compared to their representation among licensed drivers)of 4.4 percent appears to be a small number, but it is the \"same finding\" as what we reported forAfrican Americans - a 3.5 percent absolute difference (recall that only African Americans andwhites are in this analysis, so the percentage of all licensed drivers and the percent of driversstopped must each sum to 100 percent) 63Americans of the magnitude claimed against police by the American Civil Liberties Union in other jurisdictions, in which the chances of an African American being stopped were seventy-five times that of a white (various ACLU docum ents on racial profiling can be found at the Web site, see Reference under ACLU). Nevertheless, the 3.5 percent absolute difference in stopsrepresents an approximately 16.5 percent relatively higher chance of an African American beingstopped (3.5/21.2) than there are African Americans with licenses (across all charge types). Of course, what some may define as a small difference may still be a matter of great moral and legalconcern. 10 There are several reasons why the racial disparity shown in this table, however, should not be interpreted necessarily as evidence of racial bias\u2014 although bias of the various forms wehave discussed earlier in the report could account for the racial disparity. Something as basic asroutine variations in patrolling by district could explain the disparity (for example, morepatrolling in urban areas, where African Americans are disproportionately found on thehighway). Still, and although preliminary, the data analysis does indicate a first glimpse into theextent of racial disparity, and it seems to be in the direction of more action against African64Americans, at least relative to their number in the licensed resident driver population for the state as a whole. Initially reviewing this indication of racial disparity statewide, we observe that the percentage of those cited or warned who are Af rican American varies across types of behavior (for example, speeding, lack of driver's license, faulty equipment, et cetera). These variations are interesting, in part because we did not expect there to be large differences in the percentagesof cases involving African Americans across types of charge (why would bias be exercised for some types of charges and not others?). Howeve r, when presented with differences, we find it useful to try to understand whether the differences might be due to variations in behaviors across offense types. For example, should we interpret the high prevalence of African Americansamong those cited for speeding as evidence of bias against African American speeders or asevidence that African Americans speed more than whites? Could the difference be due to, inpart, relatively more African Americans on the highways at times of the day when morepatrolling occurs (we address this later in the report)? Should we interpret differences inregulatory violations (such as failure to produce a valid drivers license or vehicle registration) as evidence of racial bias for that type of offens e (note that troopers rarely know before stopping a vehicle that the driver does not have a license)? Or might it be due, perhaps, to differences in thepromptness with which African American and white drivers renew their licenses andregistrations? Thinking about these issues in the abstract, it seems plausible to us that the educational and social class background of the driver may enter into the explanation of disparities in somecitation rates. It is plausible that those with less education or who are of a lower social class may not have the same financial resources as higher educated and higher social class drivers, and65therefore may be less likely to renew registration or licenses in a timely way or fix faulty mufflers at the first sound of trouble. It is generally the case that African Americans (onaverage) have lower income levels and are more likely to have less formal education and to bedisproportionately from lower social classes. Un fortunately, we have no measures of social class in our data so as to verify some of these observations. Nevertheless, some readers may prefer tointerpret the patterns of data as evidence of class-related behavioral manifestations whereasothers may prefer to see the patterns as indicative of bias. The results shown in Table 2.1 indicate that by far the largest racial disparity in citations is due to license-registration-insurance viola tions. Although we do not know the social class background of the specific individuals involved in citations, it seems less plausible to assumethat troopers' racial bias manifests itself more for license-registration-insurance violations than for all other types of violations than to assume that there is a behavioral basis for the disparity inthese types of violations. Our reasoning is that citations and written warnings associated withlicense-registration-insurance infractions are clearly the responsibility of the driver (whereasthere may be some doubt for a somewhat more subjective determination such as a charge for\"vehicular weaving\" if a driver is seen crossing the center-line). If there is trooper racial bias operating in this class of violation, it could be that the troopers \"look the other way\" when they find that a white driver has a revoked license. However, given the seriousness of this offense (license revocation and/or no insurance, forexample, require a court appearance), it seems unlikely that giving whites a \"pass\" would occurfrequently, and even less likely that ignoring such an offense would be more common than\"looking the other way\" for less serious or more common violations such as speeding below atriggering threshold or \"driving too close.\" That is, these data provide some prima facie11 However, since we are missing about a third of the stop records, in part due to lack of data on checkpoints, we do not think the stop records are as reliable a basis for evaluatingdisparity as the citation data are. Written warning records are more complete than stop data, butreceiving a written warning is a less severe sanction than receiving a citation, so arguably awritten warning sanction rate that is relatively high is inherently ambiguous as to possible racialbias. 66evidence that some cause other than racial bias (perhaps social class), may be responsible for racial variations in the behaviors that driver s are exhibiting on the highways, resulting in their receipt of citations and warnings. A racial bias explanation of all the patterns in the table would involve a specification that there are some behavi ors where bias is exhibited and others where it is not. We assumed, at the beginning of this research project, that the more subjectively assessed behavior data, such as \"driving too close\" or \"v ehicular weaving,\" would indicate more disparity against African Americans because the subjectivity lent itself to cognitive bias manifestations. That is, all else being equal, we assume that it is easier to be biased in reacting to the driving ofan African American if an objective indicator, such as a radar gun, is absent. The results inTable 2.1, however, suggest that this is not the case. Behaviors that we thought would involve greater subjectivity, such as \"unsafe movement\" or \"failure to stop/yield,\" show quite low racial differences in percentages (for citations\u2014 however, the percentages are somewhat higher forstops). 11 One can see in Table 2.1 that there are variations in the percentages of African Americans who are stopped, cited, or given a writte n warning. In general, we argue that the three data sources are not equal, however. Recall that we estimate that the stop data base ismissing about a third of its records (up to, but probably less than, a third of its record since we donot have data on checkpoint stops - see Appendix G). Thus, these data may be a less reliable67source on which to assess the extent of racial disparity. The citation and written warning data bases are reasonably complete. However, written warning data, we argue, are inherentlyambiguous. Once stopped by the NCSHP, we suspect that all drivers would likely prefer awritten warning to a citation. Consequently, is a high rate of written warnings issued to AfricanAmericans possible evidence of racial bias, or ra ther, is it evidence that African Americans are less likely to receive a citation? If one interprets stops that result in written warning as eventsthat are really a \"pre-text\" for further investigation and a search, then there must be a substantialnumber of searches of African Americans resulting from these written warning events. We donot find this to be the case (see Chapter 4 for a discussion of the number of searches conductedby the rank and file NCSHP troopers). In evaluating the likelihood of racial disparity, we argue that the most complete and least ambiguous official record source of information that may reflect bias is the citation data base(See Appendix G for the details of this argument). In Table 2.1 we can see that AfricanAmericans are more likely, relative to their representation among licenseddrivers\u2014approximately 21.2 percent-- to be cited for license-registration-insurance violations,speeding, equipment violations, other motor vehicl e violations, and Driving Under the Influence (DUI) than are whites. At the same time, African Americans are less likely to be cited for unsafemovement and failure to stop/yield. Their chances of citation here are approximately equal tothe 21.2 percent baseline comparison on seatbelt-type violations. As such, the results for citations have a possible \"income\" or social class interpretation. Given that African Americans in general have lower incomes and are more likely to hold poor er paying jobs, it would not be surprising that offens es related to income would be more prevalent among African Americans. License or registrati on expirations, as well as equipment violations,68may occur more often among those having less money to make such repairs as replacing mufflers or fixing tail lights, and thus may disp roportionately involve higher numbers of African Americans. Put another way, these results represent prima facie evidence that NCSHP stops and citations may reflect what they see to a greater extent than who they see. The findings on citations of speeders are also in teresting in light of recent data from New Jersey (Lange et al., 2001) suggesting that, for at least some highway areas (but not others),African Americans speed more than whites. Similarly, we have found that in a non-representative sample of fourteen highway se gments in North Carolina, African Americans speed more than whites in twelve out of fourteen highway segments (our observational baseline study is described in Appendix A). However, neith er of these studies provide a solid scientific basis for generalizing the results to other areas. Nor does either study control for obvious sources of speeding behavior that may be associated with race, such as age, gender, or inter-state travel. Put simply, we do not know for sure whether African Americans generally speed more thanwhites, or if they only do so on some highways under some specific conditions (for example,where there is a high speed limit, during certain times of the day, or differences in originationand destination points). Indeed, it may also simply be the case that, among African Americans, those driving on the highway segments observed in New Jersey and North Carolina are\u2014on average\u2014younger, more likely to be male, or more likely to be driving long distances. All are common correlates of speeding behavior. 69Table 2.1 Frequency of Type of Citation, Stop and Written Warning by Race, African Americans and Whites Only (Row Percentages) Type of Citation White estimate that approximately one third of the stop records are missing (partly due to the lack of stop data on checkpoint stops) and thus caution should be exercised in interpreting these two columns of data. Percentages for African Americans can be compared to the 21.2 percent of African Americans with licenses in North Carolina. 12 Written warnings, which the troopers are expected to write for most equipment violations, speeding that is not too excessive, and some other violations, are also issued in accordance with the NCSHP's policy of promoting good community relations. In general, theaverage citizen would rather get a written warning than a citation. However, written warningsalso have been claimed to be \"pre-textual\" in nature: troopers stop African Americans ostensiblyto give a warning, but in reality the trooper is \"checking them out\" for more serious offenses. 13 By perceived \"gift\" we do not mean to imply that warnings are issued to individuals based on subjective factors, as opposed to objective ones, such as the seriousness or nature of theoffense that the officer is confronting. Presumab ly a written warning is more likely if the drivers is only driving a few miles over the limit, as opposed to 10 or 15. Thus, in general, warnings arefor less serious charges. 70Although written warnings are somewhat ambiguous to interpret, we will discuss the pattern of findings in the table. 12 Written warnings results indicate that African Americans are over-represented in the unsafe movement violations resulting in written warnings. Thus, itseems that African Americans are stopped more often for unsafe movement, but that they receivea written warning instead of a citation for the offense. One interpretation could be that a writtenwarning is consistent with the level of seriousness of the infraction. An alternative interpretationis that the troopers use \"unsafe movement\" written warnings as a pretext for evaluating thedriver and the vehicle prior to conducting a search. The pattern is similar for vehicle equipmentviolations, but less pronounced. Given the infr equency of searches by the regular NCSHP troopers, however, we do not think that there are very many \"pre-textual\" written warning stops. It might be that these higher warnings for unsafe movement and equipment violations are apretext to check licences, registration, or for the presence (or smell) of alcohol. Still, we do notsuspect this to be the case. In our conversations with troopers, they sometimes describeddiscretionary written warnings more as a \"gift\" to drivers (or as fulfilling a directive such as inthe case of equipment violations) rather than an investigative tool. 13 To the extent that the differences reflect or are interpreted as racial bias, it seems more likely that they would arise out14 See discussions in Appendix G of the limitations of the stop data, in which we suggest that about a third of the stop forms seem to be \"missing\" from that data base - in part because of lack of data on checkpoint stops, and the likelihood that the citation and written warning data 71of a more subtle cognitive bias process in which low level driving violations appeared more serious to the troopers when the driver was African American. In summary, Table 2.1 indicates that when compared to the number of licensed drivers, African Americans are over-represented among the ranks of those stopped, cited, or issuedwritten warnings. No clear pattern emerges to differentiate stops from citations and from writtenwarnings. Generally speaking, the percentages of individuals stopped, cited or issued a written warning indicate that there is no large-scale racial disparity (of the magnitude often presentedand discussed in the media). Some racial disparity is found in the citation data, but we have nobasis to rule out the possibility that there are differences in driving location and driving related behaviors associated with race. Written warnings are clearly more commonly issued to AfricanAmericans. However, given the fact that written warnings are preferable to citations and the factthat there are very few searches conducted of African Americans as a result of these types ofstops, we see an ambiguous pattern of disparity. In addition to our interest in written warnings, we are especially interested in verbal warning stops because they are a new source of information on trooper-citizen contact. Verbal warnings began to be recorded by the NCSHP in January, 2000. They represent a form of trooper intervention that was not systematically recorded previously by the NC SHP. Note that verbal warnings represent a very small proportion of reported stops (less than 3 percent). We do not conduct as extensive an analysis of verbal warning stops as we do of citations primarily because we have less information about such stops (due to the questionable quality of the stop data - See Appendix G) and because they very rarely result in an automobile search.14 Table 2.2base have records not accounted for with stop records. In addition the identity of the trooper is recorded differently on the stop forms (a special assigned identity number is used rather than the trooper's registry number). This identity number exists for the purpose of protecting the trooper, but it also limits accountability in data processing. For example, if stop records are not always turned it by a trooper, there would be no systematic way to determine that fact. We believe, based on comments by troopers in the focus groups that we conducted, that troopers occasionally do not fill out, file or enter electronically (or have entered for them by a secretary) the stop form information. Thus, for example, in the year 2000 there are more \"citation events\" (occasions where at least one citation is issued) than stops -- even when we exclude citation events where accidents are involved. We expected there to be more stops than citations since the vast majority of citations result from stops (as opposed to resu lting from an accident investigation). That is not the case, however. Because stops, citations, and written warnings are different data bases with different processes associated with them, one should not expect the number of written warnings, verbal warnings, and citations to sum to the number of officially recorded stops. 72shows the percentage of written warnings and verbal warnings issued to African Americans (we repeat the findings on written warnings from Table 2.5 to provide some comparative referencefor the verbal warning findings). The results indicate that 22.8 percent of the drivers issued awritten warning for speeding are African American, whereas 30.7 percent of those issued averbal warning are African American. In general, the results show that African Americansrepresent a higher proportion of verbal warnings than they do of written warnings across allviolation categories. The over-representation of African Americans among those given a verbal warning can be interpreted in two different ways. The first interpretation would be consistent with thehypothesis that the NCSHP shows greater leniency to African Americans, in part due, perhaps, to increased scrutiny of the NCSHP by the media, state legislature, and others. Alternatively,verbal warnings have been discussed as a result of a \"pre-textual stop\" (to reiterate, a pre-textualstop is a stop for further police scrutiny, commonly expected to be for the purpose of conductinga search of the vehicle.) While neither interpretation can be ruled out, it should be noted that\"only\" a couple of thousand (2,023) verbal warnings were recorded in the stop data as issued to73African Americans in 2000, out of nearly one million stops or events resulting in citation or written warning. Thus, the observed verbal warnings of African Americans represent a very small proportion of all the interventi ons of the NCSHP with citizens. The idea that troopers stop African Americans as a \"pretext\" is a plausible interpretation if in fact African Americans are: a) stopped and given written warnings more often than whites; and b) have their vehicles searched more often than whites. The first condition is not sufficientas evidence of pre-textual stops, as written warnings are less serious forms of interventions thancitations, and if such interventions are occurri ng more often for African Americans than whites, this could be interpreted as evidence of leniency toward African Americans. It could mean, also,that troopers are making legitimate stops for viol ations of traffic law that warrant no greater sanction than a written warning. The second condition does not hold as far as the rank and filetrooper is concerned. The vast majority of troopers do no proactive searches at all (see the discussion in Chapter 4 regarding searches). Thus, we have no empirical basis upon which tosuspect that the average trooper in the NCSHP is stopping drivers to issue a written warning inorder to check out the driver or the vehicle for signs of more serious violations (drugs or guns), else such searches would be more prevalent. From the analysis above, it could be said that there is the possibility of some low level of bias, for some driving violations, against African Americans, as African Americans are generally 74Table 2.2 Frequency of Type of Written Warning and Verbal Warning to African American Drivers (Counts and Percentages*) Type of Violation Written Warning to African AmericansVerbal Warnings to African Americans Speeding 19,698 (22.8 percent)615 (30.7 percent) Unsafe Vehicular Movement 7,079 (25.7 percent)225 (35.4 percent) Failure to Stop or Yield -- 36 (32.7 percent) DUI -- 125 (33.3 percent) Substandard Vehicle Equipment 8,812 (26.6 percent)251 (37.4 percent) Failure to use Safety Devices -- 93 (23.5 percent) Vehicle Registration, License, Insurance, or Inspection 18,994 (23.0 percent)116 (28.0 percent) Other -- 562 (29.7 percent) Total 54,583 2,023 * Percent = percent of all African Americans and whites issued a written warning or a verbal warning. Example: \"22.8 percent of all the whites and African Americans issued written warnings for speeding in 2000 are African American.\" over-represented relative to the 21.2 percent of all African American and white drivers. Yet, there are a number of possible alternative explanations, such as the possibility that AfricanAmericans drive more frequently on highways where the NCSHP happens to work, or that theydrive more at times of the day when the NCSHP is working (for example, night versus day). The plausibility of these explanations was enhanced when we conducted our baseline study at fourteen sites (each consisting of 10-15 mile stretches of busy North Carolinahighways), finding that the proportion of driv ers who were African American on different75highways within the same county could vary considerably. This suggests that a mismatch between the extent of patrolling by the NCSHP a nd the prevalence of African American drivers could easily exist. We also learned from the observational data that the NCSHP's citationbehavior is segmented: some parts of some highways may account for a rather large proportionof all citations (more on this below). As a consequence of the analysis done so far, we began to understand that, in order to properly account for the likelihood of mismatch, it would be reasonable to explore analysis ofdata at relatively small units of analysis, such as what we call \"county highway areas\" (thecontinuous stretch of a single highway across about one third of a county). We chose this unit because it was the only unit of analysis available that was smaller than a \"county area\"\u2014all ofthe highways within about one third of a county. We also surmised that there was probably moresimilarity in the drivers and driving behavior on a given, single highway area than on anintersecting highway area in the same county. Thus, the county highway areas would bereasonable units of analysis for addressing the mismatch issues discussed above (although farfrom perfect units of analysis). In addition, we also realized that we only have one type of baseline measure of driving behavior at the county-highway-area level\u2014accident data (forexample, the proportion of drivers involved in accidents who are African American), so that comparisons with other proxy measures would only be possible at higher (larger) units ofanalysis, such as the NCSHP's fifty-three dist ricts covering the state (on average, a district consists of two counties). 76Racial Disparity in Districts The preliminary evidence on racial disparity in stops, citations, written warnings, and verbal warnings leads us to consider the possibility that citizen behavior could be responsible forthe disparity. Unfortunately, we have no data base with which to test alternative hypothesesconcerning disparity due to other factors, such as the types of racial bias that could be manifesting itself in the form of cognitive biases against African Americans. This unknownplagues us throughout the report. It is difficult to account for bias processes when, for the mostpart, we are limited to outcome data. Still, the extent of racial disparity in the findings that wehave reviewed so far is far smaller than many would have anticipated. The data in the tables above were for the entire state of North Carolina, and because the state is large, the possibility exists that we might find greater (or lesser) degrees of disparity if wewere to look at sub-sections of the state. Researchers refer to this as \"dis-aggregating\" the dataor, more precisely, aggregating the data to smaller units of analysis than the state as a whole. (Wesay \"aggregate\" because the process involves combining information for individual troopers tosome areal unit of analysis such as a county or a district.) Proxy Measures of Citizen Driving Behavior One methodologically weak assumption, relevant to the tables above, is that we compare, for example, the percentage of drivers cited fo r a traffic violation who are African American to the percentage of African American drivers assumed to be on the highways in the state as awhole. Although the vast majority of those w ith North Carolina driver's licenses presumably drive on North Carolina roads, they do not do so equally. In our attempts to interpret the data on77citations it would be preferable to have a baseline of data against which to compare citation rates for smaller units of analysis than the state as a whole. Except for baseline data collected at fourteen cites (see Appendix A), we do not have data on citizen driving behaviors on the highway. Yet, several proxy measures of driving behavior are available, including the U.S. Census data, the N. C. Division of Motor Vehicles licensed drivers data base, and the NCSHP accident record data base. In some of our earlier analysis, weexamined the U.S. Census data and found that a measure such as \"proportion of residents who areAfrican American living in a district\" was some what less highly correlated with the proportion of citations issued to African Americans than was the proportion of African American licensed drivers, and so we dropped the U.S. Census data from further consideration. We reasoned that the number of licensed drivers would be expected to be a more accurate reflection of drivers likely tobe on the highway speeding and committing other violations such that the presumed superiority ofthe Division of Motor Vehicles' data seemed reasonable. Still, the reader should be cautious ofbaselines associated with census counts as a proxy for who is really on the highway. Below, we compare the validity of three types of proxy measures of driver behavior: number of licensed drivers, an estimate of what we call \"drivers driving,\" and drivers involved inaccidents. The Division of Motor Vehicles made available to us the data on licensed drivers withinformation on the county in which the driver resides. The demographic characteristics of thedrivers on the highways in a county could be estimated by making the strong assumption that thedrivers driving on the highways and violating the law (speeding, driving erratically) mirrored thedrivers who were residents in a county. Of course, we know this not to be true with regard togender (males drive more than females) and age (the young drive more than the old), but we have78no data to suggest that the racial representativeness of the drivers is substantially different from that of the residents. Our second proxy measure of driving behavior takes into consideration the fact that drivers drive outside of their county of residency, and for some counties this consideration mayaffect the measure of the racial composition of the drivers in a county. For example, countiesadjacent geographically to a highly urban county with a large African American population may have a higher percentage of African Americans on their highways due to the spillover of drivers from the more populated county. Alternativel y, counties disproportionately African American may have large numbers of white drivers pass through them, especially on the interstates,lowering the proportion of drivers who are African American, relative to the populationproportion. To take into consideration the invasion of drivers from one county to another we used the following estimation technique to estimate the proportion of \"drivers driving\" who are AfricanAmerican: we made the assumption that drivers who drive outside of their county do so in amanner proportionate to their representation in the population of their county of residency. Thatis, if 20 percent of the residents in a county are African American, then we assume 20 percent ofthe drivers who drive in another county from th e county in question are African American. We estimate the number of drivers from a county who are in another county by using data on citationsand matching the records with the DMV data base. Thus, for example, if 500 individuals cited inCounty Y were residents of County X, then we assume that approximately fourteen times that many drivers from County X actually were driving in County Y in the year in question (fourteen is the approximate multiplier actually used, base on the general risk of receiving a citation in agiven year, roughly one in fourteen). The assu mption we make is that the demographic makeup79of these \"invader\" drivers parallels that of the residents of County X. Through this method we were able to estimate the number of drivers driving in each county, and compute the proportion of\"drivers driving\" who were African American. We refer to the measure as our estimate of\"drivers driving.\" The third proxy measure is the most powerful measure in the sense that we can count the number of drivers who are African American a nd who are involved in accidents for relatively small areas, such as highway areas. A highway area is the area along a highway in what theNCSHP call an \"area\" of a county (roughly one third of a county). The NCSHP record most ofthe accidents that occur in the rural areas of the counties, with the exception being the large urban counties where the local police record many of the accidents. Earlier in the report we showed thatthere is a reasonably high correlation between the proportion of drivers in accidents who areAfrican American and the proportion of speeding drivers who are African American. We would expect that the proportion of accidents involving an African American driver and the proportion of drivers cited who are African American should approximate one another. Although we argue that the accident data provide the best proxy measure at small units of analysis (See Appendix G), our initial data inquiries discovered an interesting pattern. There aremany accidents on the relatively narrow roads in rural areas of the state, where patrolling isgenerally light. These roads do not have as high a volume of traffic as do the relatively morewell-traveled interstate, U.S. and N.C. highways, and thus individually these \"country roads\" tonot warrant heavy patrolling. By contrast, th e busier highways are safer (fewer accidents per vehicular miles driven), but because of the high volume of traffic, they warrant heavier patrollingthan the rural highways (in part the patrolling is justified because more vehicles can be slowed bythe visual presence of troopers on the busy highways). One implication of this for race is that the80majority of rural paved highways in North Carolina have a higher percentage of white drivers compared to the busier highways, which are the more heavily patrolled highways. As aconsequence, we find that the more rural counties tend to show excessively low rates of citationsof African Americans, and the more populous areas slightly higher rates of citations of African Americans when we compare the proportion of cited drivers who are African American to theproportion of drivers who are African American and in accidents. We will discuss this morebelow. Accidents are much more infrequent than citations, and so we found in necessary to aggregate three years of accidents to get a sufficient number of accidents to justify statisticalcomparisons. We examined the data to see if there was any evidence of a change in thepercentage of drivers involved in driving accide nts who were African American. Generally the correlations across years were very high, indicating stability in the demographic composition ofthe drivers over a three-year period (results not shown here). The demographic profile of driversinvolved in accidents was explored further to determine whether the \"contributing circumstances\"of the accident, which had been recorded for only about half of the drivers involved in accidents, were correlated with the types of driving behaviors that elicited citations. (A \"contributingcircumstance\" is perhaps a benign way to express finding fault with the driver's behavior.) Forexample, a factor such as \"excessive speed\" may be considered a \"contributing circumstance.\" We thought initially that if, for example, 20 percent of the drivers cited in an area for speeding were African American, then we might e xpect that 20 percent of the drivers in accidents in which speeding was a \"contributing circumstan ce\" would also be African American. Although there was generally a strong correlation between speeding citations and speeding \"contributingcircumstances,\" our analysis indicated that the behavior-specific accident measure was a less15 The figure 19.8 represents the percent African American of all white and African Americans involved as drivers in accidents in th e NCSHP accident data file for the aggregated years 1997 through 2000. 81valid indicator of who was driving on the highway and a less valid measure of who was violating a law (such as speeding) than was the measure of the proportion of drivers involved in accidents(regardless of \"contributing circumstances\"). Part of the measurement error here may lie withthe fact that only about half of the accidents have data on \"contributing circumstances.\" The \"lost\" observations (accidents with no contributi ng circumstances indicated on the official forms) are substantial in number, and their omission makes the correlation with citation data worse. Insummary, among the accident measures (specific-behavior versus accidents in general), the bestcorrelate of the proportion of citations issued to African Americans (or for any specific type ofbehavior resulting in a citation) is the propor tion of drivers in accidents who are African American. Statewide, the differences across the various proxy measures in the percentage ofdrivers who are African American is rather small: Census 21.8 percent, resident licensed drivers21.2 percent, \"drivers driving\" 21.6 percent, and accidents 19.8 percent. 15 Of the four, the percentage of drivers in accidents who are African American represents the lowest percentage, and thus the more conservative of the four baselines against which to compare stop, citation, andwritten warning rates. We say \"conservative\" because accidents are the baseline with the lowestestimate of the percent African American, and thus it is most likely to generate a positivedifference score (or a larger positive difference score) relative to the African American rate ofstops, citations, and written warnings. Because racial differences in statewide data could easily be accounted for by the presence of more patrolling in the more urban areas (and urban areas are generally more AfricanAmerican), it is appropriate to examine the data at smaller units of analysis. Figures 2.2 through822.4 show the correlation and \"scatter\" involved in the relationship between three proxy measures of behavior and the proportion of citations issued to African Americans: resident licensed drivers, \"drivers driving,\" and drivers in accidents. Note that the correlations are calculated at the troopdistrict level (N=53). The correlations are essentially the same across these three proxy measures(r's range from .93 through .96), such that most researchers would say that the three measures areindistinguishable in terms of predictiveness. That is, the proportion of citations issued to African Americans at the district level can be equally pr edicted by using residency data, \"drivers driving\" data, or accident data. Figure 2.2 provides an example. Here the pr oportion of resident licensed drivers who are African American is graphed (the horizontal ax is) along with the proportion of cited drivers who are African American (the vertical axis). The middle line in the figure is the linear regressionline, or our statistical model's best estimate of what proportion of cited drivers should be African American, given the general pattern. The small, hollow boxes that are scattered around theregression line are actual observations of districts (fifty-three of them). As one can see, the scatter of boxes is both above and below the regression line, with most of the scatter occurringwithin a 95 percent confidence interval around the line. That is, most of the scatter is within a 83 Figure 2.2 Proportion of Citations Issued to African Americans by Proportion of Resident Licensed Drivers Who Are African American, by Troop District (N=53 Districts) 84range such that one could not claim that any one observation is different statistically from the estimated point on the middle line. At first glance, the evidence of Figure 2.2 seems to indicate a remarkable similarity between the proportion of residents and citations involving African Americans. The correlation here is .941. However, there are four points to consider in analysis of these data. First, seeminglysmall general differences are not assumed to exist in a specific district. For example, there is adistrict with only .18 African American resident s but that has .27 of drivers cited as African American. Such a district should not be ignored. Nine percent more of those cited are African American than who are African American residents. Second, the intercept value (where theregression line crosses the vertical axis) is approximately .04, indicating that more AfricanAmericans are cited than are resident by about 4 percent. Thus, the overall disparity evident inthe figures is in the direction of excess citations of African Americans. Third, it is important tobear in mind that there are only fifty-three observati ons in this figure, such that the slope of the regression line could change with only a few observations \"tipping the balance\" one way or another. More racial disparity, as defined as distance from the regression line shown here, could be the consequence in some districts, less in others . Fourth, the data on the fifty-three districts are aggregated from all the smaller areas in the districts. There could be areas within a district whereAfrican Americans are treated disparately, but we cannot determine that using the aggregated numbers presented in the figure because they represent an average for the whole district. We willtake up this theme in greater detail below. Thus, in summary, the information in the figure ishardly sufficient grounds to terminate further evaluation, but rather it gives us reason to lookfurther. 85Figures 2.3 and 2.4 show the results for our estimate of \"drivers driving\" and drivers in accidents (proportion who are African American), respectively. Figure 2.3 seems at first glance to look a lot like Figure 2.2. There are several differences, however. For one, the slope issteeper, indicating that as the proportion of estimat ed \"drivers driving\" who are African American increases, the proportion of cited drivers who are African American becomes even higher than isthe case for changes in the resident proportion African American. For example, compare theintercept value, which is near zero, with the value of the cross of the two reference lines at the .35proportions. We can see that the regression line estimate lies approximately .03 above the pointwhere the two reference lines cross. Again, as was the intercept value in Figure 2.2, the directionof bias is one slightly detrimental to African Americans. The higher the proportion of driversdriving who are African American, the greater the disparity in the citations to African Americans. In Figure 2.4, we have the scatter of observations in a regression with proportion of drivers who are African American as recorded in accident data compared to proportion of drivers cited who are African American. Here we see yet a different pattern. This time the comparisonof the reference line cross point with the predicted value from the regression line shows an evenlarger discrepancy, roughly .06, and the disparity grows with the higher proportion of African Americans among the drivers in accidents. That is, where there are more African Americans on86 Figure 2.3 Proportion of Citations Issued to African Americans by Proportion of \"Drivers Driving\" Who Are African American, by Troop District (N=53 Districts) the highway (as measured by this baseline), there is a larger disparity in the proportion of African Americans cited, relative to the proportion in accidents. Thus, it would appear that, despite thehigh correlations indicating that approximately 90 percent of the variance in the proportion ofdrivers cited who are African American can be accounted for with one or the other of the threeproxy measures of behavior in the figures above, there are nevertheless reasons to examine thedata further because they are suggestive of racial disparity and possible racial bias. We need to87see if there is more conclusive evidence of bias than has been presented thus far, since we have been just scratching on the surface of the data. It should also be noted that the evidence lies in thedirection that some might hypothesize using a \"racial threat\" hypothesis: the more African Americans present in an area, the greater the tendency for them to be issued citations. However,we must also point out that we have been looking at the data in a rather superficial way, and that further analysis is necessary at smaller areal levels to justify such a claim. When we use the term \"superficial,\" we mean that there are several basic reasons to question the relationships between the variables in the figures above. For example, some of thedistricts having the highest proportion African Am ericans are in urban areas where many of the accidents are handled by the local police, thus possibly driving down the number of accidents handled by the NCSHP. That alone would not affect the proportion African American involved in accidents, except for the fact that it is possi ble that the NCSHP \"work\" accidents and patrols somewhat differently. They may patrol some highways where the local police typically write upthe accidents, yet the NCSHP still issues citations in those areas. They may handle all of theaccidents on all highways in more suburban areas, where the more dangerous local roads areresponsible for a higher proportion of accidents relative to that of the busier highways (wheremore tickets are written). That is, the bulk of the patrolling may occur on the busier highways,resulting in a discrepancy between the proportion in accidents who are African American and theproportion cited who are African American. 88 Figure 2.4 Proportion of Citations Issued to African Americans by Proportion of Drivers in Accidents Who Are African American, by Troop District (N=53 Districts) More important than the relative locations of accidents and citations in urban areas, however, is the fact that there is variation by time of day in the proportion of drivers who are African American and in the patrolling of highways. In the more urban areas or where aninterstate passes through, there is relatively more patrolling at night, when African Americans aremore likely to be on the highway. This driving pattern is not a well known fact, so we need toestablish it. 89Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey The data presented in Figure 2.5 are taken from the 1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (U.S. Department of Tr ansportation, 1997). The purpose of that study was to assess the amount and nature of personal travel in the United States. The figure represents thetime of day that respondents who live in the South Atlantic states leave for work, by race. WhiteAmericans are more likely to be leaving for work during the hours of 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. than areAfrican Americans. Between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 1 p.m., there is a steady decline inwhites leaving for work, while at the same time there is an increase in African Americans leavingfor work. From 2:00 p.m. until approximately 6:00 p.m., African Americans are slightly morelikely than whites to be leaving for work. After 6:00 p.m. until about 9:00 p.m., there is not muchdifference in the time that white and African American respondents are driving to work. Finally,between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., African Americans are again more likely to bedriving to work. Overall, the pattern indicates that African Americans are slightly more likely than whites to be driving to work during late-night hours and mid-afternoon hours. Figure 2.6 shows the time of day by race that respondents are traveling for any purpose (not just work). There appears to be even larger differences in the times of day that white andAfrican American respondents are on the road than were observed above for leaving for work. African Americans appear to be leaving home in the early morning hours and late night hoursmore frequently. Between the hours of 12:00 a.m. (midnight) and 5:00 a.m., they are more likelyto be on the road. This trend significantly decreases between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00a.m., when whites are more likely to be leaving home for some type of travel. Further, between90Figure 2.5 Hour of Departure of Trips to Work by Time of Day, South Atlantic States, 1995 Survey the hours of 12:00 p.m. (noon) and 5:00 p.m., whites also more likely to be on the road. After 5:00 p.m., the trend swings back to the greater representation of African Americans. Overall, much like for work travel, the pattern indicates that whites and African Americans are on the roadat significantly higher rates during different tim es of the day, with greater African American representation at night and in the early morning hours.91Figure 2.6 Hour of Departure for All Trips, By Race and Hour of Day, South Atlantic States, 1995 Survey 92One more point needs to be made regarding the citation rate of African Americans at night versus during the day. One might argue that the NCSHP actually makes decisions to patrol moreat night in some areas as a result of racial bias or cognitive racial bias. However, in an analysisnot presented here, we found that the accident rates generally determine the citation rates acrossdistricts and across time of day, so it would not seem likely that race is involved in the decisionsto patrol more or less at night, although we cannot rule out the possibility that some smalldifferences that are observed may be accounted for by such bias. As can be seen in Figure 2.7, the ratio of night to day citations (number of) substantially varies across districts. In Districts 3 and 46 (not their actual district numbers), for example, there are more citations issued at night than in the day, whereas for most districts the majority ofcitations are issued in daytime. Since we know that the proportion of African Americans on thehighway varies with the time of day and the amount of citations written in a district varies acrossdistricts by time of day, it is necessary to control for time of day in the analysis. It should also benoted that although the involvement in accidents of African Americans (and whites) increases at night, they increase more for African Americans. Thus there is some explanation for an increasein the proportion of citations issued to African Americans at night. However, it should be noted that further information could be useful in eval uating the question of whether or not the amount of patrolling at night is warranted by the volume of accidents at night. In the analysis below, we will present results separately for day and night time stops/citations to control (at least crudely) for the variation in the time of day differences acrossraces. Before doing so, however, we need to disc uss another possible explanation of disparity in 93 Figure 2.7 Ratio of Night Citations to D ay Citations, Fifty-Three Troop Districts the proportion cited and the proportion driving who are African American, what we call \"spatial heterogeneity\" (Smith et al., 2000). Spatial Heterogeneity Troopers patrol areas where the highways have many accidents and where there are relatively many violators of traffic laws. They al so patrol where it is more convenient to patrol (there are turn-around capabilities\u2014 for example, overheads, or no guard rail or fence between94opposing-direction-bound lanes, and other factors) . The NCSHP's choice of specific locations may also be made based on the prevalence of certain types of citizen behaviors\u2014 such asspeeding. If drivers tend to speed on some highways more than others, and those highways havemore accidents or are simply more convenient to patrol, there will be more patrol activity, andmore citations will be issued there. In Figures 2.2 through 2.4 above, we saw that whether one used the proportion of licensed drivers who are African American, or the pr oportion of \"drivers driving\" who are African American, or the proportion of drivers in accide nts who are African American, the correlation with proportion of cited who are African Amer ican is very high (.93 through .96). Figure 2.8 shows the same variables in a slightly different format (although we omit the information here onresidents as it is very similar to that of \"drivers driving\"). Here the proportion of \"driversdriving\" who are African American is subtr acted from the proportion cited who are African American. Similarly, the proportion of driver s in accidents who are African American is subtracted from the proportion of cited driver s who are African American. These difference scores show essentially the same information as in Figures 2.3 and Figures 2.4 above, only herewe examine difference scores, whereas above we examined a regression of one measure of\"proportion African American\" on the proportion of cited who are African American. In Figure 2.8, however, it seems easier to \"see\" the differences in terms of disparity unfavorable to African Americans and disparity in the opposite direction. What we see in Figure 2.8 is that several districts have differences in the proportions unfavorable to African Americans larger than .05 (for example, Districts 15, 18, and most of the districts between District 44 and 52). Because there will almost always be some differences between the measures in question and unknown sources\u2014 or what is called \"random error\"\u2014 we 16 We say \"likely measurement error\" but we do not formally derive the estimate of what is likely measurement error, but rather assume that the relatively high variations observable inthe figures are more likely to be areas where bias might be occurring in decision making. 95Figure 2.8 Differences Between Proportion Cited who Are African American and Proportion of 'Drivers Driving' Who Are Af rican American and Proportion Cited Who Are African American and Proportion Drivers in Accidents who Are African American need to adopt some standard of difference below which we will call \"likely measurement error\" (and which we will ignore here for the sake of di scussion), versus a difference that we define as large enough to require further investigation.16 Here we use a difference of +/- .05 somewhat arbitrarily, but too small a difference would lead to a large number of false positives and false96negatives. The +/-.05 criterion gives us a basis for making comparisons in some further analysis below. In the present graph, we are interested to see if the pattern of \"positives\" and \"negatives\"\u2014 districts with difference scores above .05 and districts below -.05, respectively\u2014 are similar across the two measures. They are somewhat distinct, in that the difference scoreswith the accident measure tends to identify more positives and more negatives than the differencescore based on \"drivers driving\"(ten accident di fference scores are above .05 compared to four \"drivers driving\" difference scores; while six negative difference scores are below -.05 compared to only two \"drivers driving\" scores). But the accident difference score (again comparing theproportion cited who are African American to th e proportion of drivers in accidents who are African American) also has more \"negatives\"\u2014districts with less than -.05 difference scores (inother words, fewer African American cited than in accidents\u2014six to two). What the readercannot learn from the graph is that the districts (which have an arbitrary identifier code attachedto them to identify them only to the researchers) are generally geographically adjacent. So, forexample, most of the districts to the far right of the graph are near one another geographically, as are many of the districts with difference scores in the middle half of the chart. The implication of this is that the patterns of positives and negatives are likely to be due to some shared unmeasuredcharacteristic (perhaps some organizational or geographic characteristic associated with thedifference score variables or their component variables). Ideally as researchers, we would like toidentify those characteristics. The comparison in Figure 2.8 of \"drivers driving\" and accidents as a baseline against which to evaluate the proportion issued citations who are African American, indicates that more districts qualify as \"positives\" using accidents as a baseline. For that reason (to be conservative17 By conservative here we mean that we would prefer to err on the side of rejecting the null hypothesis of no racial difference. 97in testing the racial disparity hypothesis),17 as well as the fact that accident data are available for measurement at relatively small units of analysis, we will proceed to analyze further the accidentdata, and return to a discussion of drivers driving and resident licensed drivers at the end of thechapter. The possible advantage of small units of analysis centers around the question of whether patrolling occurs evenly across geographic areas within districts compared to the distribution ofAfrican American drivers (and their driving behavior) within districts. The issue we raise is thatthere may be a mismatch of where patrolling occurs (too little or too much) relative to whereAfrican American drivers drive. There is a possible mismatch if \"spatial heterogeneity\" occurs inboth the geographic distribution of African American drivers and in the distribution of patrolling. For illustration purposes, Figure 2.9 below shows an area of Nash county in North Carolina, where two major highways intersect, I-95 and U.S. 64. (the other roads on the diagramare fictitious). The proportion of drivers who are African American among those we define as \"threshold speeders\" is presented in the figure. We traveled each of these highways for a week aspart of what we call our observational baseline study (see Appendix A) to determine whichproportion of drivers there drove at speeds higher than the local \"speeding threshold.\" Thespeeding threshold is defined as the speed at which a citation for speeding was likely to be issued(this we define more precisely as the median speed at which drivers were issued citations). Theproportions of African American drivers at or above this threshold are shown for each highway, and they differ substantially (12 percent absolute difference). The aggregated data for NashCounty of the number of citations of African American threshold speeders who were issued98citations would be greatly affected if it happened to be the case that there was more patrolling of I-95 than U.S. 64 (the proportion of citations issu ed to African Americans would be lower), or if there was more patrolling of U.S. 64 (the propor tion of citations issued to African Americans would be higher). If the patrolling was evenly distributed across highways, there would be no \"spatial heterogeneity\" issue, as the overall rate comparison would be based on a compositeaverage of the citations and the speeding drivers. The highways in Figure 2.9 are two of fourteen that we have observed (see Appendix A). In the four counties where we observed two di fferent highways, we found that the proportion of threshold speeders who are African American va ries substantially between the two highways, with an average difference of about 5 percent. In other words, there is considerable spatialheterogeneity in the distribution of African American speeders between highways. Since ourmeasure of their speeding is reasonably accurate and objective (in other words, based onobservation, not on official records), we must c onclude that there is little doubt that there is variation within a district in the racial composition of speeding drivers. (We will show below thatpatrolling varies considerably from highway to highway.) Thus, comparison of rates at the levelof county or district (such as the fifty three dist ricts in the figures above) will be prone to biased estimates in the face of a mismatch of wher e drivers drive and where the NCSHP monitors vehicles. This mismatch is a manifestation of the more general problem in areal analysis of\"spatial heterogeneity.\" To address the questions of the mismatch of where drivers drive and where the NCSHP looks for violations (spatial heterogeneity), we present difference scores based on small units ofanalysis, the highway area (as defined above). It consists of a stretch of highway covering aportion of a county (usually about a third of a county). The advantage of the highway area as a99unit of analysis is that we have at least two reasons to believe that the mismatch of drivers and patrolling discussed above is lessened by studying highway areas as a unit of analysis rather thanlarger units of analysis such as counties or districts. First, we have examined the distribution ofthe proportion African American cited along stretches of highway within areas where milemarkers exist, and where they are recorded in the citation data base, as compared to theproportion on intersecting highways. We find greater consistency (less heterogeneity) in theproportions along stretches within the county areas. Secondly, we know that patrolling oftentakes place in the form of driving up and down ra ther long segments of highway (we rode with troopers and observed troopers in their routines of patrolling), thus providing some evidence thatareas of highways are patrolled in segments. Although far from ideal in terms of testing a\"mismatch\" hypothesis, we think that there should be less of a mismatch between trooperpatrolling and vehicular driving behavior within smaller geographic units of analysis (the smallerthe unit of analysis the less mismatch is likely). 18 Thus once a vehicle enters a stretch of highway at an intersection, the vehicle cannot exit the highway until the next intersection (except in the rare instance of a U-turn on thehighway). 100Figure 2.9 Two Major Highways in Nash County, North Carolina I95 NC_3 NC_526% Th. Speeders Are BlackExample of Spatial Heterogeneity in Threshold Speeding Behavior In Relation to Heterogeneity in Patrolling Behavior (Nash County) US64 38% Th. Speeders Are Black If we had more observations, we could define an extremely small unit of analysis, such as the area of highway between intersections. Fo r these extremely small units of analysis, presumably the demographic make up of that segment of highway would be homogeneous acrossits span (since by definition no turnoffs exist). 18 Within such a unit there would be a decrease in the number of issues associated with spatial he terogeneity. Essentially, the amount of patrolling (frequency of patrolling) of a highway segment would be assumed to be equal between the two intersections, allowing us to compare the proportion cited who are African American to the19 It is not obvious that a geographic unit of analysis defined as a stretch of highway between two intersections (they have been called \"face blocks\" in other research) would notsuffer from possible spatial heterogeneity concerns. Assuming that a patrol car that enters such ageographic area must exit it, however, it can be argued that all parts of the area are equallypatrolled, and that over time the proportion African American cited for violations should beconstant or homogeneous within each unit (face block). There could be variation across areas(face blocks) in the extent of patrolling, as some areas are patrolled more often than others. However, when all the areas of a county or district are aggregated to the county or district level, and weighted by each area's contribution to the c ount of citations and accidents, the difference between the proportion cited who are African Am erican and the proportion in accidents who are African American should be unbiased. Take an extreme case where NCSHP rides up and downone highway in a county, ignoring all others in the county (except when they are called toaccidents). One might think that in such a situation the estimate of proportion cited who areAfrican American would be biased relative to the proportion in accidents who are AfricanAmerican, but if the data are weighted by the c ontribution of citations and accidents, there could only be an estimate based on the highway patrolled, since there could be no calculation of theproportion of those cited who are African American in the other districts (no citations occurred there, and division by zero is impossible). Ta ke another example, where 90 percent of the citations occur on one highway in a county, and 10 percent are scattered across other highways. Again, because the data are weighted when aggregated to the county level, and because the unitof analysis ensures homogeneity within units, there will be no bias in the estimates. 101proportion involved in accidents on those same segmen ts of highway. We do not have such data, however. 19 We only have data statewide for the accidents and citations in a county highway area. One problem with studying highway areas, however, is that we must be concerned with a small number of observations within a highway area. There can be either too few citations or toofew accidents in an highway area to justify co mparing the two proportions (African Americans cited to those involved in accidents). For purpos es here, we find that requiring five or more citations and five or more accidents, and then constructing weighted averages of all those highway areas meeting those criteria, gives us the same results as requiring twenty or thirtycitations and twenty or thirty accidents in a highway area. To demonstrate that the \"five or more\" restriction does not lead us to radically different conclusions, we compare the difference scores counting all accidents and citations versus theaggregated difference scores based on a minimu m of five. Figure 2.10 shows the relationship102between the aggregated difference score measures using weighted averages of the proportion cited who are African American minus the proporti on in accidents with African American drivers (aggregating all highway areas with five or mo re citations and five or more accidents), as compared with the difference scores between citations and accidents for the districts as a whole(for example, what we presented in Figure 2.9 above). The weight used for the \"five or more\"difference scores is the sum of the number of incidents (citations plus accidents) in a districtdivided by the total number of incidents (citations pl us accidents) for the district. Our intent with the figure is to illustrate that the dropped highway areas do not have a large impact on the twotypes of difference scores compared here (all accide nts versus five or more accidents/citations in a year). Yet, even though there is little overall difference in the proportion African American usingall accidents or five or more per year, results vary for specific districts, depending on which difference score is used. For example, in District 18, the aggregated difference score results in an8 percent higher estimate for citations to accidents using the \"five or more\" restriction than do theaggregated counts, which are then calculated as proportions and then subtracted from the proportion of citations issued to African Americans. It should also be noted that the requirement of \"five or more\" citations and accidents is designed to limit the variation in the error when calculating \"proportion African American citedor proportion African American driving vehicles in accidents,\" but is in no way intended to be a sufficient empirical basis for comparing propor tions for any one highway area. Rather, comparisons are made using the aggregated highway area data (summing across highway areaswithin a district to the district level), as oppos ed to differences for any one highway area. By aggregating the highway area differences and weighting them, the district comparisons arepredominantly affected by the highway areas with the larger numbers of incidents (citations and20 We tested for whether or not 1 or 5 or 10 or 15 cases or up to 200 made any difference to the analysis by comparing correlations between the proportion cited who are AfricanAmerican and the proportion drivers in accidents who are African American, and found that the correlations deteriorated below .500 when less than 5 citations/accidents were used. The numberof highway areas drops from 10,474 to 3,233 when we require 5 or more citations and accidents, so we lose information on a substantial number of highway areas where there is little action(accidents or citations). We know of no a priori reason to believe that bias should be exercised in less trafficked areas than in more trafficked areas. Also, when we examine the data are largeunits of analysis, the racial disparity is not large in absolute terms, so it is very doubtful thatracial bias is occurring in less busy places. 103accidents). When the highway areas are aggregat ed to the district level, hundreds of highway areas are typically aggregated and weighted by the proportion of all the citations and accidentseach highway area represents. The effect of these weights is to limit the amount of errorgenerated for each district with small numbers of observations. 20 In summary, thus far we have seen that time of day and the mismatch of patrolling and driving in local areas can lead to differing results in the comparison of driving behavior to thecitation receiving experiences. What remains is to combine the aggregated difference scores atthe highway area level separately for daytime and nighttime, so that we control for both time andspace mismatch of patrolling and driving beha vior (as measured by accident involvement).104 Figure 2.10 Comparison of a Baseline with All Accidents and a Baseline with Highway Areas of 5 or More Accidents and 5 or More Citations Day and Night Rates In the analysis below, we distinguish between citations and accidents occurring between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m, (night) from those occurring between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. (day). Figures 2.11 and2.12 illustrate the proportion of citations issued to African Americans and the proportion ofaccidents involving African Americans for the fi fty-three districts for day and night times, respectively. In Figure 2.11, the differences in the positive direction that we observe aresubstantially fewer in number than we observed previously in Figure 2.10. That is, examining 105Figure 2.11 Difference in the Proportion Cite d African American and the Proportion in Accidents Who are African American, Daytime Only (Min of 5 Accidents and 5 Citations Per Highway Area) daytime rates and controlling partially for spatial heterogeneity mismatches result in only 3 districts having greater than a .05 difference sc ore (proportion of those cited who are African American minus proportion in accidents who ar e African American). Examining negative difference scores, there are now nine districts with less than -.05 difference score values(indicating that African Americans are under-represented among the ranks of those issuedcitations in those areas). 106Figure 2.12 Difference in the Proportion Cite d African American and the Proportion in Accidents Who are African American, Nighttime Only (Min of 5 Accidents and 5 Citations Per Highway Area) In Figure 2.12, the difference scores are compared across districts for citations and accidents at night. Here, there are six districts w ith difference scores of .05 or higher, while there are fifteen with negative difference scores of - .05 or lower. Again, we are controlling for time because we are limiting the observations to nighttime (again 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Looking atdifference scores calculated at the highway area level and aggregating to the district level, we seeyet a different evaluation of the districts than that which we observed by simply comparing the differences in the proportions at the district level.107What are the Mechanisms that Generate Positives (and Negatives)? Several of the districts in Figures 2.11 and 2.12 show racial disparity in the proportion cited who are African American relative to the proportion in accidents who are African American, and several of these districts are geographically ad jacent to one another. Not visible in the figures is the fact that several are part of the same troop. This raises several questions about thesedistricts. Are these districts home to troopers who engage in some form of racial bias? If so, how does the bias manifest itself? Can we determine if the bias is likely to be at the individual trooperlevel, or can it be accounted for at the aggregate level? Furthermore, is it inadvertent, or possiblyeven rationally based (for example, the resu lt of deployment to highways with high accident rates)? Still, one need to address the districts in the figures with a negative differential (less than-.05) in proportion cited who are African Ameri can to the proportion in accidents who are African American (those areas with too few African Am ericans issued citations)? What could be accounting for the \"reverse discrimination\" pattern? Could it be some form of reverse racial biasor aversive bias (avoidance of African Americans) or even attempts on the part of some troopers to avoid the appearance of racial bias by gi ving breaks to African Americans by issuing them fewer citations? We will address possible racial disparity on the part of individual troopers more directly in the next chapter. Here we consider further subtleties in the processes being studied here. Webegin by examining the six positives in Figure 2.12 above (nighttime positives), Districts 4, 15,46, 47, 48, and 49. One possible explanation for these positives has to do with where patrollingoccurs relative to where accidents occur. We discussed earlier that there is a tendency for theNCSHP to \"go where the action is\" in the sense of traffic, rather than patrol where the accidents are (so as to prevent accidents through their greater visibility in the area). Table 2.3 shows the108breakdown of accidents and citations for the six districts with more than a .05 difference in proportion cited who are African American to pr oportion in accidents who are African American. The percentage of all accidents and of all citations occurring on the road type is presented. Thus,for example, in District 15, 8.2 percent of the accidents occur on the interstate, whereas 13.5percent of the citations occur on the interstate. In general, there is a mismatch between whereaccidents tend to occur and where troopers patrol (almost one-half of the accidents occur on ruralpaved roads across districts [District 49 excepted], whereas about one-quarter of the citations[varying up to 33.8 percent] occur on rural paved roads, suggestive of under-patrolling of ruralpaved roads). Of course, this does not mean that the NCSHP troopers should change what theyare doing and focus on rural paved roads. Rural paved roads are numerous and constitute themost frequent type of road and the most cumulative road miles (data from the N.C. Department ofTransportation, not reviewed here, indicate this to be the case). That is, it may be inefficient topatrol such highways because they are too dispersed, whereas the N.C. highways, U.S. highways,and interstates are not as dispersed (indeed, they are often the central traffic arteries of an area.). In three of the six districts shown, the type of road most heavily patrolled is the type of road with the highest or second highest pr oportion of drivers in accidents who are African American. Thus in essence, the NCSHP \"over-patrols\" the type of highways in these districtswhere African Americans are more prevalent dr ivers. This over-patrolling could account for much of the positive difference between proportion cited and proportion in accidents who areAfrican American. In two of the remaining three districts, there are small differences in theproportion of citations issued to African Ameri cans across highway types, and in both districts there is a relatively high percentage of rural paved roads patrolled (about a third of the citationsoccur on these roads and the proportion cited who are African American is substantially higher109than the proportion in accidents). While this could be the result of racial bias, another possibility is that the daytime rush hour traffic, which is predominantly \"white\" (assuming the NationalTransportation Survey results hold here), accounts disproportionately for many of the accidents,driving down the proportion of African Americans involved in daytime accidents. By contrast African Americans are somewhat more likely to be on the road in off-rush hour times - such as atnight, when accident rates are generally lower. See Appendix G where we discuss the fact thatthe ratio of accidents to injuries varies considerably from high-volume traffic roads to less-volume roads: the \"fender-bender\" type accident may be more numerous in rush-hour traffic, but also more likely to involve whites. This is a possibility that warrants further exploration. One exception to the general pattern in Table 2.3 is District 49, in which virtually all of the accidents are occurring on the interstate, and citations there are relatively less than called forby the accident rate. Still, 81.6 percent of the nighttime citations in the district are written on theinterstate. In this district, citations are also issued on U.S. highways, and both the interstate andU.S. highway citations tend to drive up the proportion African American number cited. We arenot sure what could be the cause (racial bias or something else), but, again the predominantlywhite rush hour may be accounting for a high percentage of the accidents, driving down theproportion African American rate.110Table 2.3 Percent of All Accidents and Percent of All Citations by Road Type, Six \"Positive\" Districts, Nighttime District Interstate U.S. Highway N.C. Highway Rural Paved Roads Accid's Citation Accid's Citation Accid's Citation Accid's Citation 4 - - 37.2 46.5 28.4 31.8 34.4 21.715 8.2 13.5 20.4 35.9 29.8 31.3 41.6 19.246 - - 38.8 58.1 6.4 8.4 54.8 33.547 - - 25.5 59.5 18.0 14.1 56.5 7.8 12.1 35.8 37.4 22.6 46.2 33.849 99.0 81.6 .6 8.3 .2 8.6 .2 1.5 Read: \"37.2 percent of all accidents in District 4 occur on U.S. highways, whereas 46.5 percent of all citations occur on U.S. highways in that district.\" For nighttime differences in the proportion of those cites who are African American relative to the proportion in accidents who are African American, the results for the districts withpositive difference scores greater than or equal to .05 (not shown here) also reveal a relativelyhigh percentage of the drivers in accidents w ho are African Americans on the highway types where the highest proportion of citations are issued. The patrolling in these districts at night time is most often (modal category) on interstates or on U.S. highways, and it is on these samehighways that African Americans have a relatively high representation in the ranks of thoseinvolved in accidents (indicating presence on the highway, and to some extent culpability ordriver error). 21 Thus once a vehicle enters a stretch of highway between an intersection and another intersection, the vehicle cannot get off that highway until the next intersection. 111Citation Zones as a Causal Mechanism In addition to variations in rates on road types within districts and within what we define as \"daytime\" and \"nighttime\" hours, we think that it is useful to consider the importance of\"citation zones\" in the citation process within a stretch of highway. That is, there is a very localgeographical distribution of citations, and exam ining them may shed light on how deployment might account for the positives and the negatives in the figures above. In Figure 2.13, we review a stretch of I-85 in North Carolina that has several major intersections. The hash marks indicate mile markers, and the longer lines indicate intersections. What is striking about the figure is the variation in the number of traffic stops across miles ofhighway. They vary considerably from 814 to nineteen (with only 2 miles separating these two 1 mile stretches of I-85). The mechanism by which stops occur in the district where this segment ofI-85 is located, is probably a function of deploym ent (defined simply here as where the NCSHP troopers stop vehicles) and also somewhat on the behavior of those vehicles. Notice how the number of citations are substantially higher near the major intersections. This is not because thedensity of traffic is necessarily higher at those points\u2014there are no other intersections along thisstretch of I-85. 21 Drivers' behavior may be involved to the extent that those entering the highway quickly attempt to approximate the traveling speed of the other vehicles on the highway. Obviously this involves accelerating the vehicle, and may involve surpassing not only the speed limit, but the \"threshold\" speed limit in doing so (the speed limit as enforced on that stretch of I-85, roughly about 15 mph above the posted speed limit). Other factors may include geographicinclines or declines, but we did not collect data on such attributes. 112Essentially, the areas in the figure with hundreds of citations issued could be classified as \"citation zones\" (including what some may call \"speed traps\"\u2014 although more than speedingcould have triggered a stop in that location). As discussed earlier, by the term \"citation zone,\" wemean to include more than what is usually meant by the term \"speed trap,\" typically troopers with Figure 2.13 NCSHP Stops on Interstate 85 by Milepost Number of African American and White Stops radar guns sitting stationary, hiding in bushes or behind an overpass. A citation zone is located where there is a high volume of stops for any reason. Citation zones account for a highproportion of all stops (the top 4 miles in total stops account for 66 percent of all the stops on this13-mile stretch (in other words, 31 percent of the miles account for 66 percent of the stops). We do not know if accidents co-occur proportionately to the stops because we do not have milepost (locational) data for accidents. However, it would be surprising to find a closecorrespondence of accidents by milepost markers. For example, we find it hard to believe that113there would be forty-three times as many accidents in a 1-mile stretch of I-85 as compared to a stretch 2 miles away (we have examined the distribution of accidents across county areas\u2014onethird of a county\u2014 for I-85, and find that the length of the highway in an area and its proximity tolarge urban centers are strongly associated with the number of accidents). Even if, say, the milewith 814 stops had disproportionately many of the total number of accidents along this 13-milestretch of highway, it is unlikely that the stops would be proportionate to the accidents. Rather,other factors, such as the volume of violating behavior and availability of turn-around spots are associated with making a \"stop place\" attractive. More research needs to be done on regardingthis consideration. In summary, one of the key \"mechanisms\" by which citations are generated along a busy interstate is the \"citation zone\" (anywhere a disproportionate number of tickets are written). Accidents in a district, by contrast, tend to occur in areas where the citation zones are probablyseldom employed: small, relatively narrow, rural roads. Recall Table 2.3 above, which shows thedistribution of accidents by type of road across the districts with \"positive\" scores in Figure 2.12. Also shown are the proportion of citations by type of road. Clearly, there is a mismatch. It would seem that troopers do not necessarily patrol roads where accidents are more likely to occur, butrather patrol highways \"where the action is\"\u2014the larger interstates, U.S. highways, and N.C.highways. The type of accident and the preval ence of types of highway could account for the mismatch of patrolling and accidents. Accidents due to road design (such factors as narrowroads, poorly maintained road shoulders, steep inclines, or the presence of stop signs or lights) areassociated with less dense traffic, such as accidents on what are called \"the rural paved\" roads. Also, there are many such roads across the rural areas of North Carolina, such that the fewNCSHP troopers on duty on any one shift would not be wisely using their time to patrol these low22 By \"disaggregate\" here we mean more literally that we aggregate the data to relatively smaller units of analysis, such as the highway area, as opposed to the trooper district. 114density highways. Rather, more violators (and po ssibly more deserving violators) are available on the busier highways where the troopers are best deployed. It is ironic that troopers may bebest deployed on the relatively safe (but highly used) roads. How then might the positives of Figure 2.11 and 2.12 be generated? Deployment decisions to patrol the busier highways (maki ng NCSHP cars \"highly visible\") could account for the disparity in the racial component relative to accident rates. If African Americans happen to beon the larger, busier highways more so than whites, the rates of citation will be higher for AfricanAmericans, independent of racial bias on the part of troopers. If deployment decisions are irrationally based, as opposed to rationally based (\"we patrol there because the fishing is good\"rather than \"we patrol there because preventable accidents occur there\"), the argument could bemade that the racial disparity is inadvertent, but preventable by a change to a more statisticallygrounded deployment strategy. Summary In this chapter we have seen how the data, when aggregated to the entire state level, show some disparity in the citation rates, indicating over-stopping and over-citing of AfricanAmericans. However, the extent of racial dispar ity varies considerably by type of charge. Only some types of charges show disparity against African Americans. Moreover, there are manypossible reasons for such statistics at the statewide level, potentially having little to do with bias. As we disaggregate 22 the data to smaller units of analysis, we begin to get a clearer picture of the extent and whereabouts of disparity, and of the po ssible bias forms it could take (conscious bias,23 We propose that the percent of reported accidents in which the drivers are African American is a measure of the prevalence of African American drivers on the highway. Somemay prefer to attribute driving ability to be m easured by involvement in accidents, but we do not make that claim. Note that we are referring here to accident reports and not to citations nor toany attribution of responsibility for the accidents. 115cognitive bias, inadvertent-irrational bias, or rational bias). Looking at the a somewhat disaggregated analysis for districts (N=53), we s ee some differences in terms of racial disparity, with some districts having more disparity evident than others. The results speak to the possible value of using different baselines, against which to compare the percent of African Americans cited or warned. We can compare citation and writtenwarning data to the resident licensed population proportion who are African American, or to the \"drivers driving\" who are African American, or to the proportion of drivers in accidents who are African American. 23 We argue that the latter may be a convenient, if not superior, type of data for looking for bias because of its widespread availability, and the fact that it can be measured atrather small units of analysis\u2014 here the highway area (a stretch of highway that covers anNCSHP officially designated area, or about one third of a county). At the highway area level, when we calculate the difference scores for each highway area with five or more citations and five or more accidents, and aggregate that information to thedistrict level (N=53), we find several district s that have high rates of citations of African Americans (also several with low rates, relative to the accident rates). We focused on thesedistricts for further analysis, and found that th e racial disparity is probably in part due to deployment. Specifically, it appears that the NCSHP deploys troopers to busy highways, whichgenerally are not the highways where most accidents occur, but are the highways where AfricanAmericans may more often be found as drivers. 116Other researchers working in the area of racial bias and profiling have struggled with the problem of identifying baselines that are appropriate for making comparisons. The mostwidespread baseline used is still census counts of residents in an area. We find here that theaccident baseline, while far from perfect, provide information that at relatively small units ofanalysis. Because of the availability of these data at small units of analysis, accident data probably should be used as a baseline more generally in research on policing and possible bias ordisparity. Looking at the results in terms of the bigger picture, the differences in racial disparity observed in the early tables of this chapter are probably largely accounted for by deploymentdecisions and by variation in vehicular behavior across the races. Further analysis would benecessary, and further discussions with the NCSHP leadership, to determine the likelihood thatthe deployment decisions have been arbitrarily made -- and could be changed - if inconsistentwith a more rational plan to allocate troopers to highways. Such a plan would presumably bebased on preventable accidents (such as is part of the Total Quality Management approach of theNCSHP in the past few years). Such an analysis and discussion is beyond the scope of this report,but would nevertheless be worthwhile. As researchers who are confronted with the data and analysis available to us, we believe that we have demonstrated that some racial disparity exits in the findings, whether large or smallunits of analysis are used, but that what seems to account for the disparity is probably mostlybehavior of the drivers of the vehicles, as well as deployment decisions, whether made by thecommanders, sergeants, or the troopers on the highway. The possibility also remains that some ofthese decisions are guided by conscious bias or alternatively by cognitive bias. In the nextchapter we will explore further the possibility that cognitive bias plays a role in the day-to-day117decisions of troopers. That is, we assess individual trooper propensities to depart from the citation standard set by other troopers in the trooper's same district. 118References for Chapter Two American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). 2002.

Web Citation: www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/sept97.htm119Chapter 3 Racial Disparity at the Individual Trooper Level Goals of Individual Trooper Analysis The question of whether or not racial disparity is present, as well as the extent and nature of it, can only be understood fully if the behavior of individual troopers can be evaluated. In theprevious chapter, we argued that the context in which a trooper works will be important inaccounting for the racial make-up of the citizens he or she stops, cites, and warns. In the presentchapter, we will make use of the measures of context from the previous chapter and assess theextent to which individual troopers deviate from an expected number of citations written toAfrican Americans. That expected number (based on a statistical model) may be largely based ona trooper's colleagues issuing citations in a similar, or even the same, context. Our purpose in this chapter is, in part, to consider in some detail whether or not a methodology can be devised to serve as a source of information to identify troopers who deviatefrom the norm (baseline) in their citations of African Americans. We would like to know if we can explain the citations of African Americans by the contexts in which the troopers work, as wellas by the characteristics of the trooper, such as his or her race, gender, or age. As such, thischapter's topic is a matter of much concern to both the NCSHP and the public. Troopers aregenuinely concerned that their behavior might be labeled as racially biased, and the public wants to know if particular troopers behave in biased manners. It should be made clear from thebeginning that our goal is not to identify or name individual troopers, but rather to develop and illustrate statistical methodologies that could be used by police organizations to generateinformation on racial disparity (generate one type of information) at the individual trooper level.120This information would require further validation by an organization before any conclusions could be drawn about whether or not racial disparity is a problem. Presumably, the methodologies described in this chapter would be supplemented with additional information to validate that a racial disparity problem exists. Such additionalinformation could include a more detailed analysis of the patrolling patterns of a trooper who hasa seemingly high rate of African American cita tions. Or it might include reviews of citizen complaints, or even discussions with troopers in a district about the possibility of the existence ofa hostile racial climate in that district. We wa nt to be clear that the proposed methodologies here represent \"pieces of the puzzle\" rather than a de finitive indication of the presence of a racially biased trooper. Individual Level Characteristics As mentioned above, and as discussed in the previous chapter, there are some individual characteristics of troopers that may be pertinent to any disparity that may be found in theircitation behavior. For example, one might hypothesize that white troopers would be more likelyto display bias toward African American driver s than African American troopers. Tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 show the demographic breakdown of all NCSHP troopers working in North Carolina incalender year 2000. As can be seen, only 15.4 percent of the troopers are African American (asmall number of other minorities have been excluded from the table), compared to approximately22 percent of the adult population of North Carolina. Women are much more under-representedrelative to their representation in the population (only 1.7 percent). The majority of troopers arebetween the ages of 31 and 44 (54 percent), with 25.5 percent younger than 31 and 20.5 percentolder than 44.24 The number of training programs completed obviously can vary across officers not only for the reasons of professionalism, but also because of age, tenure on the force, and otherfactors. 121Table 3.1 Racial Make-up of North Carolina State Highway Patrol Race of Trooper Frequency Valid Percent African American 212 15.4 White 1168 84.6 Table 3.2 Gender Make-up of North Carolina State Highway Patrol Gender of Trooper Frequency Valid Percent Female 24 1.7 Male 1383 98.3 Troopers not only vary in age, but also vary in years on the force and the extent to which they have participated in training programs. The more training programs that a trooperparticipates in may be understood as a measure of professionalism. Troopers who take the time toparticipate in various training programs might be considered to be among those who take theirwork more seriously than others, who want to improve their job performance, or, alternatively,who have acquired a more professional attitude toward their work. 24 Table 3.4 shows the number of troopers participating in specific types of training programs, and Table 3.5 shows the number of training programs completed by varying lengths oftime of employment. In Table 3.4, the most popular training program is CPR, with about 82percent having completed this form of training. The second most popular courses are trainingclasses for security involving \"executives\"\u2014usually government leaders or dignitaries for whom122the NCSHP may provide security. The third most popular training program is Division of Criminal Information (DCI), which involves some training in evidence gathering and basic crimescene forensics. We will not discuss the specific nature of all of these programs, but present themto make the reader aware of the nature of possible training programs available to the trooper. Also, as we mentioned above, the participation of a trooper in multiple forms of trainingprograms may be an indication of \"professionalism\" on his or her part, but this is\u2014as ofyet\u2014speculative on our part. Our hypothesis is that the more professional the orientation of thetrooper, the less likely he or she would apply the law in a racially biased manner (at least in anovert way). Later in the chapter, we will assess whether or not our hypothesis is supported. In Table 3.5, we take up the question of whether participation in training programs is a function of time on the job (tenure). As expect ed, those troopers only on the force for a year or two have had the least opportunity to accumulate training experience (45.6 percent of troopers intheir first two years have had no training beyond the academy). Approximately 18 percenttroopers have managed to complete three or more of the training programs. In general, the longerthe years of employment, the more training programs are completed. The majority of thosetroopers with six years of tenure have completed six or more training programs. At the sametime, it is noteworthy that among troopers on the job for twenty-one or more years, about 47percent have less than six completed training programs. Troopers on the force for less time havegenerally completed more training programs. (Possibly the older troopers already had years ofexperience before some of the training programs became available, and many of them may havethought the training was unnecessary since they we re performing ably at the job already.) 123Table 3.3 Age Distribution of North Carolina State Highway Patrol Age of Trooper Frequency Valid Percent 30 years old and younger 359 25.5 31 thru 36 376 26.7 37 thru 44 384 27.3 45 and older 288 20.5 One might argue that the race of the trooper would be important to examine relative to the race of the citizen, under the assumption that if white troopers are biased, a higher proportion ofthe citizens they stop or cite would be African American than the proportion cited by their fellowAfrican American troopers. Table 3.6 shows that the reverse is true, a result that is puzzling onlybecause we have failed to take into consideration the fact that African American NCSHP trooperstend to work in areas where there are high percentages of African American citizens and AfricanAmerican drivers. In Table 3.6, it can be seen that 31.7 percent of all citations issued by AfricanAmerican troopers are issued to African Ameri can citizens, whereas only 24.2 percent of citations issued by white troopers are to African American citizens. A similar pattern is observed forspecific types of reasons for citations (speedi ng, unsafe movement, and failure to stop/yield). In an analysis not presented here, we found that troopers on the force for more than twelve years seem to be less likely to issue a citation to an African American than are troopers with lesstime on the force. However, like the analysis above for \"race of trooper,\" this is probably due inpart to the fact that older troopers are more likely to work in areas where there are more whites(less urban counties). Thus, the context in which the trooper works may help explain the patternof data at the individual trooper level. The sm aller volume of traffic\u2014 and thus greater safety \u2014can make more rural areas an attractive area for older troopers to work, whereas younger25 The claim that the work context accounts for the pattern is purely speculative on our part, but we will take it up again in the analysis below. 124troopers must \"pay their dues\" by working more densely populated areas. Most of the rural areas of North Carolina are predominantly white, while large African American populationsdisproportionately inhabit the larger cities as well as several rural counties. 25 The general pattern of lower percentages of African American citizens cited by white troopers holds true across thereasons for the citation (speeding, unsafe movement, and failure to stop/yield). Measuring the Context of the Trooper's Behavior In the last chapter, we learned that there are various types of measures of context that could be used in the analysis, such as the racial composition of the drivers with licenses, or theracial composition of what we call \"drivers drivi ng.\" We also saw that the racial composition of accidents could be a valuable measure because it allows us to measure the context of the trooper'swork in yet another way (and arguably more precise way)\u2014the racial composition of smallerunits of aggregation than the fifty-three NCSHP districts. We assume that the smaller unit ofaggregation would be the more ideal, as it would lessen the dangers associated with spatialheterogeneity, that is, the mismatch of where drivers drive and troopers patrol, as discussed in theprevious chapter. Two such units of aggregation seemed attractive to us: the county area (roughlyone third of a county in size), and the county hi ghway area (the segment of a particular highway in a county area). The analytic question before us is how to link information about the contexts inwhich troopers work with the individual level data. That is, what is a reasonable mathematicalmodel of the processes that we have been discussing at the individual level of analysis?125Table 3.4 Type of Training Received by North Carolina State Highway Patrol Type of Training Number of Troopers who Received TrainingPercent of Troopers who Received Training Advanced Accident Investigation 115 8.2 Accident Reconstruction 103 7.3 CPR Training 1151 81.8 Division of Criminal Information 241 17.1 Drug Interdiction Program 231 16.4 Emergency Medical Tech 129 9.2 Executive Security 322 22.9 Field Training Officer 337 24 Field Training Supervisor 218 15.5 Cert Instru Specialized Defensive Driving 105 7.5 Certified Instru General 296 21 Mobile Data Training 707 50.2 Certified Radar Operator 392 27.9 Riot Control 503 35.7 Mini 14 Rifle 365 25.9 Intoxilyzer 5000 1205 85.6 Certified Vascar and Radar Operator 812 57.7126Table 3.5 Years Employed with North Carolina State Highway Patrol by Number of Training Programs Number of Training Programs1 to 2 Years of Employ ment3 to 6 Years of Employ ment7 to 12 Years of Employment13 to 20 Years of Employ ment21 or more Years of Employment No Training 57 (45.6%)8 Table 3.6 African Americans Cited by Race of Trooper and Type of Citation White Troopers African American Troopers All Citations Issued to AA 79102 (24.2%)19638 (31.7%) Speeding Citations Issued to AA56119 Movement Citations Issued to AA3614 (19.4%)831 (27.1%) Failure to Stop or Yield Citations Issued to AA2247 (18.4%)589 (25.5%) Obviously, this exercise could be done at any level of aggregation that matched the available data associated with a stop/citation or written warning with where troopers actuallypatrol. We use the spatial units that follow (primarily county area and county highway area, as127described below) because they represent the smallest units of analysis that we have with sufficient observations to warrant statistical analysis. For many applications in other venues, only data atlarger units of analysis may be available. At such levels the general method employed here couldstill be used, although, as the spatial unit becomes increasingly larger than the actual patrol area,we would expect more measurement error. Before describing the analysis further, it occurred to us that the individual trooper data allows for yet another measure of the context in which the trooper works\u2014the citations of theother troopers working in the same contexts as an individual trooper. That is, in addition to themeasures of context that we could examine as per the discussion in the last chapter, the individuallevel data allow us another measure: the percentage of those cited by other troopers working inthe same areas as the trooper whose citations of African Americans we are evaluating. To arriveat this contextual measure, we must first establish all of the areas in which a trooper issuedcitations. We do that for two levels of analysis: the county area (roughly a third of a county) andfor what we call the county highway area (all citations on a highway within a county area, minusthe trooper-in-question's citations). For example, if the other troopers issuing citations on U.S.64 in a county area issue 25 percent of their citations to African Americans, then we would expectthat the trooper in question should issue citations to African Americans at about 25 percent. That is, we assume that the 25 percent is a reasonable value measuring the racial composition of thecontext in which the trooper works. It represents a baseline against which to compare theindividual trooper's behavior. Note that below we will suggest a reservation that we have about the use of the citations of the other troopers for the purposes of identifying possible racial disparity\u2014a concern that will lead us to suggest that the accident measures of context may besuperior. In a nutshell, our concern is that, if there is racial disparity in a particular trooper's128citations, then troopers working in the same district may share in the same bias. This will be discussed more below. There are at least two options available to us in defining the metric of the dependent variable in the mathematical model. We could define a dependent variable as the proportion of atrooper's citations issued to African Americans, and compare that to the proportion in the baselinemeasures (for example, the proportion cited who are African American, or the proportion of drivers in accidents who are African American). However, we have found that the analysis of those dependent variables that are defined as pr oportions to be rather complex (Cohen and Cohen 1983:73-76). We opt instead to simply use the count of the number of African Americans issueda citation by a trooper as the metric of the variable. We will primarily rely upon ordinary least squares regression to model the number of African Americans cited in the year 2000 by each trooper in the NCSHP (below, we present theresults for average troopers on the highway, minus any troopers holding higher ranks such assergeant or lieutenant). The choice of estimation technique reflects the distribution of thedependent variables. Analyses in other contexts or at other levels of aggregation might have less normally distributed outcomes and so require other estimation techniques. We will present twomodels for each of four measures of context. The first model, which we call the deploymentmodel, will consist of the percentage of those cited or in accidents in the same county area orcounty highway area, plus the proportion of citations issued by a trooper by hour of the day. These measures constitute one baseline against which to compare the number of citations issuedby a trooper to African Americans. Another measure expected to be related to the number of African American cited is the number of whites cited by a trooper. Essentially, we are controlling here for the volume of work26 We arbitrarily divided the day into twelve 2-hour periods: 12:00 a.m. (midnight) to 2 a.m. was the first period, 2 a.m. to 4:00 a.m. was the second, and so on. The number of citationsof some of the adjacent 2-hour periods are correlated, as would be expected, since a trooperissuing citations between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., is probably also issuing citations between 4 a.m. and6 a.m. We found the correlations to be modest, however. 129done by a trooper (some issue many more citations than others). The more whites cited, the more African Americans should be cited. Recall that we found that time of day was an importantdeterminant of the proportion African American on the highways and roads of North Carolina. Troopers work different shifts and those who draw more night shifts are likely to issue a higher proportion of their citations during nighttime hours, and thus, for example, would be expected to have a higher number of citations issued to African Americans. We control for this by calculatingthe percentage of all of a trooper's citations occurring in each 2-hour period (that is, twelve 2-hour periods). 26 In the tables below, only two of the two-hour periods are represented (the others were not found to be statistically significant a nd were dropped from the equations). We also attempted to control for weekday versus weekend (specifically, number of weekday citations), butthat variable had to be dropped because it was too highly correlated with the number of whites-cited variable. Finally, we added the percentage of the trooper's citations issued on the interstatesand on rural highways, as preliminary analysis showed a tendency for African Americans to becited disproportionately on interstates and under-represented on rural highways. An individualtrooper patrolling disproportionately more on interstates than U.S. or N.C. highways would beexpected to have more citations of African Americans. A trooper working more on ruralhighways would be expected to have fewer citations of African Americans. In summary, our first model represents what might be called the deployment model. The deployment model includes statistical controls for the area and highway types in which the130trooper issues citations and the time of day he or she works. Note that we think it is reasonable to call this model a deployment model\u2014in that the variables are measuring spatial and temporalcontexts in which the trooper works. While it is possible that the choice of where one works andat what time of day is not a racially neutral decision , we think it generally unlikely that racial disparity would serve as a basis for deciding wh at district one works in, or shift of work. Our second model includes all of the variables from the deployment model, plus several individual level characteristics. These include such demographic characteristics of the trooper asrace (African American or white), age, and gender. It also includes the number of trainingprograms in which the trooper has participated (as a crude measure of professionalism), and howlong the trooper has been employed with the NCSHP. Finally, we add two measures of thegender and age composition of a trooper's citations. Specifically, we include the proportion of atrooper's citations issued to those under the age of 23 and the proportion issued to women. Weincluded these variables because, in some earlier analysis, we found some evidence that the ratesof citations for those under the age of 23 seemed to be rather high, suggesting to us that somevehicular misbehaviors may be more prevalent among the young. If so, it is possible that some ofthe citations of African Americans could be accounted for by the age composition of the trooper'scitations. That is, the more young cited, the more African Americans cited. We also include thegender composition variable to explore whether or not most driving misbehaviors occur amongmen, and whether or not, by extension, there may be some targeting of African American men inparticular by the NCSHP. If so, we would expect the proportion of cites of women to be related to the number of African Americans cited (negatively related). However, the percentage femalevariable was found to be not statistically significant in any of the models, and so we dropped itfrom the equations and tables to follow.27 Multicollinearity in the equation is minimized in part because we have centered all the variables (subtracted the mean from each variable), so as to reduce the chances of multi-collinearity with the constant in the equation. 131Before discussing the results, it should be noted that the models presented below do not include the variable \"trooper's age.\" It was dropped from preliminary models when it was foundto be too highly correlated with the variable year s of experience with the NCSHP. The decision to drop one versus the other was arbitrary, and one could reasonably include age instead of years on the force. There are no other multi-collinearity problems in the variables remaining. 27 Also, it should be noted that we have dropped all hours of the day from the equations except 2:00 a.m. to3:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.. The other hours were dropped because they were notfound to be predictive of any dependent variable, and we wanted to fit the results on a singlepage. Results for the first two context measures are presented in Table 3.7. The first column lists all of the independent variables in our regression analysis. The deployment model involvesthe percent cited who are African American (cited by troopers other than the trooper in question)within the same county areas as those worked in by the trooper in question. In the deploymentmodel, we see that for every white cited, .253 African Americans are cited. For every percentageincrease in those cited who are African American (cited by other troopers) 5.5 additional AfricanAmericans are cited by troopers. In the parentheses are standardized coefficients, which are oftenused to compare the relative magnitude of variables' effects. Thus, for example, the contextualmeasure of percentage of citations issued to African Americans by fellow troopers in the samecounty area is the strongest determinant of the number of African Americans cited by a trooper(.790). Stated another way, for each one unit change in a standard score of the percentage ofthose citations issued to African Americans by fellow troopers, we would expect a .790 change in132the standard score of number of African Americans cited. If there is no asterisk next to the standardized coefficient, neither the unstandardized nor standardized coefficients are statistically significant at the .05 level. Thus, for those variables, we cannot safely rule out the possibility thatthere is no effect of the variable. If a dash or hash mark is presented in the table, the variable wasnot included in that model. As for other results, we see that the proportion of citations issued in the late evening hours (10 p.m.-11 p.m.) is associated with .936 more of an African American citation, while 2 a.m.-3a.m. is associated with 1.138 more citations of African Americans. Thus, a trooper issuing ahigher proportion of his or her citations late at night would be expected to have more African American citations than a trooper with a lower proportion. Other hours of the day were tested andfound to be statistically insignificant, and were excluded from the table (and from the equationrepresented in the tables here), as they were not found to be significant in any of the models. Wealso find that the more citations that a trooper issues on rural highways, the fewer citations he orshe issues to African Americans (the unstandardi zed coefficient is -.251, indicating that for each percentage increase in the citations in rural highways, there is a reduction of .251 in the numberof citations of African Americans). The deployment model with the first contextual measure accounts for about 70 percent of the variance in the number of African Americans cited. On the one hand, that would beconsidered by many to be a high proportion of the variance. On the other hand, it indicates that30 percent of the variation cannot be accounted for by the deployment measures used here. We turn next to the full model, which includes the deployment variables as well as the individual level variables discussed above. The results of the full model are similar to that of thedeployment model. Note that we are examining this model for the purpose of better28 The model assume linear relationships among the variables and may not adequately capture the subtleties associated with where and when a trooper patrols. For example, a troopermay patrol more in one county area than the ot her troopers, or more during specific hours of day or even days of the week. Our model may be too crude to rule out such \"selection\"interpretations. 133understanding what might account for higher levels of African American citation behavior on the part of the troopers. We are not trying to \"explain away\" any possible bias in the citationbehavior of troopers by controlling for these indivi dual characteristics. For example, if we found that white troopers issued more citations to African Americans than African American troopers,then we could not use the predicted value from this full model as a basis for comparison. Essentially, the predicted value would itself be biased. We have no intention of using the fullmodel for such purposes. Rather, our intention here is simply to see if there are any correlates ordeterminants of African American citing behavior from these individual characteristics. As it turns out, there is only one statistically significant determinant of African American citations: the number of training programs in which a trooper participated. The more training (ofa variety of types) a trooper has, the fewer Afri can Americans cited. This indicates some support for our \"professionalization\" hypothesis: the more professionalized the trooper, the fewer theAfrican American citations. However, one should be cautious in making this interpretation,since, as discussed earlier, age of trooper is related to the number of training programs in which atrooper has participated. (Recall that age has been dropped from the equation because of highmulti-collinearity, primarily with the years of experience variable). Also, it may be that selectioncould be an interpretation of the finding: thos e with more training are patrolling highways with less traffic, and this is correlated with the racial composition of the highway not otherwisemeasured in our model. 28134In summary, the county area analysis variable\u2014citations of African Americans issued by others in a trooper's work area\u2014shows a strong relationship with the number of citations issuedto African Americans by a trooper. Controlling for workload (number of whites cited), we findsome hour of day effects, type of road patrolle d effects, as well as effects of participation in training programs. Because there is a possibility that the trooper working in the same county areas as other troopers may be working different highways, we al so evaluate the effect of the percentage of citations issued to African Americans at the county highway area level. This differs from the previous analysis, because only those highways on which a trooper has cited someone areevaluated comparatively with the citations of other troopers. That is, if a trooper has issued acitation on U.S. 64 in a county area, then only those citations issued by other troopers on U.S. 64in the same county area are used as a baseline for comparison. The results of the county highwayarea analysis are presented in the fourth and fifth columns of Table 3.7. The results are generally similar to those found for the county area analysis. Both the contextual effect and the road-patrolled effects are similar, although in the county highway area,the interstate patrolling is associated with fewer African Americans cited (a surprising findinggiven our preliminary hypothesis that there would be more African Americans cited asproportionately more citations were issued on the interstate). In the county highway areaanalysis, the variance explained is somewhat higher (.715 and .717 across the two models) than inthe county area analysis. The number of training programs is again found to be negativelyassociated with the number of African Americans cited by individual troopers. The magnitudes ofthe effects that are statistically significant are similar to those of the earlier models. The only135substantive difference in the county highway model from the county area model is that only one hour-of day effect was found (2 a.m.-3 a.m.). One concern that we have about the use of the racial composition of citations of other troopers to measure the context in which a trooper works, is that it may mask some racialdisparity due to the selection processes associated with the assignment and movement of troopersfrom one patrol district to another. For example, it is plausible that if racial bias was to manifest itself in attitudinal or behavioral displays, that the \"principle of homogeneity\" would operate:\"like attracts like.\" Those troopers with bias might, over time, find themselves working withothers who are, like themselves, biased. If so, it would not be useful to compare the racialcomposition of a trooper's citations to his co-workers. A more independent measure of context, yet one still available at the relatively small units of analysis, is the racial composition of drivers in accidents (here we use accidents over threeyears: 1998, 1999, 2000). Table 3.8 shows the results of the analysis using the percentage ofdrivers in accidents who are African American as a baseline, and otherwise using the samesubstantive models as in the earlier table. In the first column of coefficients, we show the resultsof the deployment model and find that the results are similar to that of the earlier deploymentmodel. We find that early morning citations (2 a.m.-3 a.m.), and late evening citations (10p.m.-11 p.m.) are related to African American cita tions. Here, however, we find that the higher the percentage of a trooper's citations on the interstate, the higher the number of AfricanAmericans cites. Note, too, that the explained variance is less than we found using citation racialcomposition as a context measure. Here it is approximately .60, compared to .70 using thecitation contextual measures. 136In the full model, we find that white troopers are less frequently citing African American drivers, as are those troopers who have been empl oyed longer (net of the effects of other variables in the analysis). Also, the higher the percentage of those cited who are younger than 23 years ofage, the fewer African Americans cited. The latter finding is contrary to our initial hypothesisthat there might be some targeting of younger Af rican Americans. Here we find that the younger the composition of those cited by a trooper, the fewer African Americans cited. As for the whitetrooper effect, it could be construed as eviden ce of avoiding citations of African Americans (perhaps due to concern over possible scrutiny by the media, legislature, research evaluators, orthe public in general). It could also be e xplained by possible selection effects that are not controlled for statistically in the model. African American troopers, for example, could bedeployed to highways that disproportionately have African American drivers. The results of the full county highway area model support the latter interpretation, because the white troopervariable is no longer statistically significant when we conduct analysis at the county highway area level. Turning then to the county highway area accident measure of context (the percentage of drivers driving in accidents who are African Ameri can), we see that the explained variance rises to .65 (approximately). The deployment model is about the same as before, but the full model'seffects are somewhat different because the individual level measures that previously werestatistically significant (race of trooper and percent younger that 23 years of age) are no longersignificant. Thus, there may be some value in using the county highway area as a unit ofmeasurement as it lends plausibility to the interpretation that the previously seen white-troopereffect could very well be a deployment effect. No te that the hour of day effects observed for the analysis (using the county area accident measure) remain intact for the county highway area29 We do not have, of course, direct measures of the troopers' level of cognitive bias or racial animus, so some would argue that our test for disparity might lead to different conclusions with such measures. 30 However, a more sophisticated analysis could be done with controls for auto- correlation problems due to the fact that the contexts are not measured independently since thesame accidents recur across the areas where a trooper issues citations. That is, it is likely that the 137analysis: early morning (2 a.m.) and late evening (10 p.m.-11 p.m.), in both the deployment and full models, and similarly for the percentage of a trooper's citations on the interstates. The onlyindividual level measure that remains statistically significant between the full model of the countyarea and county highway area is the percentage of those under the age of 23 years old, which hasa negative effect. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, the higher the proportion of younger peoplecited, the lower the proportion of African Americans cited. In summary, the results of the analysis of Tables 3.7 and 3.8 indicate that virtually the entire variance that can be explained with the available measures in the number of AfricanAmericans cited by individual troopers, can be explained by deployment factors. 29 The deployment factors we find to be statistically significant include the racial composition ofaccidents in the same context, other troopers' citations in the same county area or same countyhighway area, the percentage of citations issued on interstates or on rural highways, the numberof whites cited, and the hour of day in which citations are written. Of the two generic types ofcontext measures (citations and accidents), accidents probably represent a more independentmeasure of context because the citation measures may mask the extent of bias due to possibleclustering of biased troopers in the same distri cts. Of the county area and county highway area models, the latter model is probably preferable, since spatial heterogeneity issues are likely less ofan issue within the smaller unit of aggregation (aggregating or adding together all the accidents inthe county highway areas where a trooper issued citations in 2002. 30 In the county highway areaerror terms in the equations suffer from auto-correlation because troopers in the same districts will tend to have similar values in the error term of the equations. 138analysis, only deployment factors are found to be statistically significant. As such, the results are very similar to the county highway area analysis using other troopers' citations to establish abaseline of percent African American against which to compare an individual trooper's AfricanAmerican citations, except in the latter we found that the number of training programs was alsostatistically significant. The equations that we have been evaluating are somewhat crude, in that some of the assumptions of ordinary least squares regression analysis have probably been violated(specifically, lack of independence in the error terms of the equation, causing what is known asauto-correlation). Yet, the analysis does propose a general method that can be used and improvedupon for the purpose of determining whether or not individual characteristics or contexts areimportant in determining the racial composition of a trooper's citations. However, we have onemore methodological contribution to explore that more specifically addresses the question of whether individual troopers stand out from his or her peers in his or her citations of African Americans: residual scores. Identification of Troop Districts with Troopers as Statistical Outliers We now demonstrate how the models, summarized in Tables 3.7 and 3.8, could be used to begin to flag the presence of troopers who might be out of line with their fellow troopers in theirtroop district (fifty-three troop districts). Because the models used here are presented in order to demonstrate a method rather than to identify specific individuals, we caution the reader againstcoming to any conclusions about the actual presence of racially biased troopers in any troop. 139Rather, the figures below are presented to show a method with which to identify troopers who are \"outliers\"\u2014those who have more citations of African Americans than would be expected usingthe models. It should be noted that the determination of who is an outlier will vary somewhatdepending on the statistical models employed. At best, these models should be seen as providin information that may be weighed by decision makers and compared to other information to helpdiagnose the presence of racial disparity in a troop. In demonstrating the method, we will utilize the deployment model that uses the accident measure of context at the county highway area level. By doing so, we only use deployment-related variables (percentage of drivers in accidents who are African American, number of whites,type of highway, and hour of day measures), and not such individual-level variables as race or gender. Therefore, an outlier will be defined as such relative to deployment factors alone.140Table 3.7 Number of African Americans Cited by Citation and Other Contextual- and Individual-Level Variables, Models Control fo r Racial Composition of Context by Using Citations of Other Officers in Same Context (Regular Troopers Only; N=925; Standardized Betas in Parentheses) 1.Model Includes Measure at County Area Level2.

We define outliers as a proportion of all citations written by a trooper. Thus, most troops show a range, within whichnearly all troopers do not have greater than 20 percent more citations of African Americans thanthey \"should,\" relative to the number of citations of African Americans the model indicates theywould be expected to have (based on the deploym ent factors). (These nine districts in Fig. 3.1 have been chosen and assigned arbitrary identification numbers, 1 through 9, to protect theanonymity of the district and the troopers.) The box plot has four parts. For example, District 1's box plot has a dark line representing the median value, which is close to zero. That is, in District 1, the median value isclose to the expected value of the number of African Americans cited. The dark red area 31 represents the inter-quartile range of values (all the observations between the twenty-fifth and theseventy-fifth percentiles). The small \"T,\" or so called \"whiskers,\" off of the top and bottom ofthe inter-quartile range, represents the range of the observed values (minus what are defined as\"outliers\"). Outliers are defined as observations more than 1.5 box lengths from the top or bottomedge of the box. We limit the analysis here to regular troopers who have more than seventy-fivecitations issued in the year 2000, thereby to avoid classifying a trooper as an outlier based on asmall number of observations (roughly 97 percent of the regular troopers remain in the analysis). In District 4, there is one positive outlier (with relatively many citations of African Americans),and in District 7, there are two troopers who are negative outliers (having about 40 percent fewercitations of African Americans he or she \"should\" have relative to the predicted value from themodel). 143As can be seen in a review of the nine districts presented in Fig. 3.1, the ranges of the number of African Americans cited varies considerab ly from one district to another, with District 2 having a wide range and relatively high range (from approximately 5 percent above, to 20percent below the median number of African Americans cited). In Figures 3.2 through 3.7, eachof the fifty-three districts' citation patterns is shown. In general, the results indicate that there aremany outliers, both positive and negative, across the districts. Specifically, Districts 4, 11, 12, 22,23, 28, 30, 35, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 49 have at least one positive outlier, and Districts 7,10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 33, 34, 45, 48, 49 and 51 have at least one negativeoutlier. In all, eighteen districts are found to have positive outlier values, while twenty-five districts are found to have negative outlier values. An examination of these outliers reveals that the positive outliers are somewhat more likely to involve citations on interstate and U.S. highways, while negative outliers aredisproportionately from rural highways. Positive outliers were found (analysis not presented herein table form) to be somewhat less experienced troopers and troopers who work weekends. Inexamining the citations of specific troopers, we r ealized that further fine-tuning of the regression models could be possible. Although we control fo r such factors as type of highway and time of day, the variables are crudely measured. For example, some of the rural highways pass nearmostly African American communities within larger, mostly white areas. While in general, ruralhighways in North Carolina would be expected to be associated negatively with the percentage ofdrivers who are African American and involve d in accidents, there are many rural African American communities in North Carolina. Thus, some troopers who happen to issue a highnumber of citations to African Americans do so on rural roads proximate to communities withrelatively high percentages of African American residents. If such roads happen to be relatively32 Other techniques include hierarchical linear modeling, Poisson or extra-Poisson regression, or models that control statistically for the auto-correlation problem. 144safely-constructed rural highways, the accident rate could be low, possibly making the estimate of the percent African American among those in accide nts unreliable. Obviously, this points to the need to conduct further analysis and to refine the regression model with more information. It is also possible that the mechanism by which large numbers of African Americans are cited may have a lot to do with the \"citation zones\" discussion in the previous chapter. Many ofthe positive outliers were noticed to patrol more often on interstate and busy U.S. highways thanthe negative outliers did. This is suggestive of the important role \"citation zones\" may play increating a positive outlier. That is, an individual trooper may \"work a zone\" frequently over thecourse of a year and develop a large number of African American citations because he or sheworks a selected area where there are a relatively high percentage of African American drivers onthe highway (and not often involved in accidents). It is also possible, however, that the trooper is biased\u2014perhaps both in the selection of vehicles to pull over, or in the selection of an area wherehe or she will \"work the zone.\" Conclusions In conclusion, we have shown in this chapter that it is possible to model the citations of African Americans at the individual officer level, and to do so with considerable success byconventional standards of explained variance. Although more complex statistical methods can beapplied, 32 the models presented show that statistical outliers can be found in some troops but not in others. (Our experience with some of the more complex modeling techniques is that althoughthey can improve on ordinary least squares regression models, the latter will be a reasonable145approximation of the results found using the more sophisticated models). Our goal here is to show the methodological principles of baseline and individual covariates, as determinants of thenumber of African Americans cited by individual troopers. The techniques show the extent towhich a trooper's individual citation behavior varies relative to that of other troopers. Outlierscan be neatly displayed in boxplots, and further analysis can be done to help verify whether otherconsiderations, such as specific highway patro lled, frequency of patrolling, and excessive use of speed zones, are mechanisms that generate some of these high positive outliers. Finally, it should be reiterated that the determination of disparity cannot be equated with the determination of bias. Other pieces of information should be gathered to supplement anystatistical analysis similar to what has been done here. Nevertheless, the analysis here, although itcould be improved upon with further considerations of relevant factors, does demonstrate that a method can be used to provide yet another indica tion of what behaviors are occurring in the day to day actions of individual troopers. 146Figure 3.1 Box-plots of Districts 1 to 9, (Arbit rary ID Number) With Positive and Negative Outliers (Defined as Percent of Trooper's Citations) 147Figure 3.2 Box-plots of Districts 10 to 18, (A rbitrary ID Number) With Positive and Negative Outliers (Defined as Percent of Trooper's Citations) 148Figure 3.3 Box-plots of Districts 19 to 27, (A rbitrary ID Number) With Positive and Negative Outliers (Defined as Percent of Trooper's Citations) 149Figure 3.4 Box-plots of Districts 28 to 36, (A rbitrary ID Number) With Positive and Negative Outliers (Defined as Percent of Trooper's Citations) 150Figure 3.5 Box-plots of Districts 37 to 45, (A rbitrary ID Number) With Positive and Negative Outliers (Defined as Percent of Trooper's Citations) 151Figure 3.6 Box-plots of Districts 46 to 53, (A rbitrary ID Number) With Positive and Negative Outliers (Defined as Percent of Trooper's Citations) 152References for Chapter Three Cohen, Jacob and Patricia Cohen. 1983.

Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,Pub.: Hillside, New Jersey.153Chapter 4 Searches by the North Carolina State Highway Patrol One of the central issues in many of the national accounts of racially biased policing has been the consideration of the race of a driver as pa rt of a profile used in vehicle searches for drugs and other contraband. It is clear that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and FederalHighway Administration have, in the past, offere d drug interdiction training to local police forces suggesting, implicitly or explicitly, that race or ethnicity\u2014along with other vehicle or drivercharacteristics\u2014might be used to decide whom to stop and search. There have been a number ofcases around the country documenting that state law enforcement agencies search many moreminority drivers than would occur in the absence of such profiles. To the extent that race is used as a profiling tool to identify potential carriers of drugs or other contraband, we would expect to find large disparities in the odds of being searched between African American and white drivers. Racial profiling is a practice in which a police organization generates or uses a profile meant to describe a typical offender where that profile includes race as one of the criteria. Racialprofiling\u2014although at first glance, it may seem a useful tool for police work\u2014is a form ofinstitutional discrimination or institutional racism. Institutional racism refers to organizationalpractices which produce racial inequality. In policing, there seems to be at least one area inwhich explicitly race-sensitive institutional rules are still used. This is the practice of developingoffender profiles\u2014typical characteristics of drug couriers being a prominent example. There islittle question that the DEA generated such profiles in the past as part of the war on drugs, andthat these profiles include race and ethnicity, among other characteristics, which have beenpromoted as useful factors in deciding which cars to stop and search for drugs. 154The exposure of racial profiling by drug-seek ing state police in both New Jersey and Maryland played a prominent role in bringing the issue of \"driving while black\" to nationalattention. Racial profiling, when it exists, is a fairly specialized police practice. Many troopersnever search cars for drugs. Where racial profiling is part of an organizational routine, we would expect there to be evidence of high levels of racial disparity in searches. We would also expectthe practice to be embraced by most, if not all, troopers doing proactive searches. By proactivesearches, we refer to actual use of the profile, resulting in a traffic stop to look for contraband. Sometimes troopers observe contraband (or indicators of contraband\u2014smells, drugparaphernalia). In this case, the trooper is confr onted with direct evidence prior to the search and is free and justified to initiate a probable cause search. Troopers who are looking for contraband,but do not have probable cause, must ask drivers to consent to a search. Race and Searches by the North Carolina State Highway Patrol As early as 1996, journalists investigated racial disparity in searches by the NCHSP. They reported that the group of troopers specifically assigned to drug interdiction, the CriminalInterdiction Team (CIT), stopped African Ameri can men at twice the rate of other NCHSP troopers patrolling the same areas. They also reported that of the 3,501 vehicles searched by theCIT in 1995, contraband was found in only 210 vehicles (Neff and Smith 1996). In this chapter,we look at search activity by the NCSHP from 1997 to 2000, and pay particular attention tosearches by the CIT.155Troopers' Accounts of Search Behavior We spoke with both CIT and regular troopers as part of this project in early 2001. The CIT troopers were adamant that they did not cons ciously use racial profiling in deciding whom to stop or search. Instead, it was their practice to aggressively enforce the traffic laws of North Carolina. They did describe the use of other characteristics of drivers that made one car moresuspicious than another, and therefore deserving of more attention, and they did note that whenthey turned on the blue lights, there was some selectivity involved . This might include legally-reasonable selectiveness of drivers' actions, including more than a single violation, a serious violation, or an unsafe movement among a pack of vehicles. Other factors might include more benign indicators that come to troopers' attention, such as loud music, stickers referring to musicgroups connected to the drug culture (such as the Grateful Dead or Phish), or cars about whichthey felt \"something\" was out of place, or about which they had a \"gut feeling.\" When troopers gave examples of the use of indicators (we would refer to them as stereotypes) at work, they tended to be draw n from both white and African American youth or sub-cultures. The allusions to African Americans were far more general\u2014rapper music or \"theway young African American males dress\"\u2014than the examples given for whites\u2014Phish follower,tie die shirts, biker with a ponytail. From the troopers' accounts, we have little reason to expectracial profiling to be going on in a self-conscious way as late as 2001. Still, there is little reasonto ignore the potential for stereotyping and cognitive bias to influence face-to-face highwayencounters. Further, the stereotypes used to de scribe suspicious African American drivers tend to be much broader and more diffuse than the stereotypes more likely to apply to whites. CIT troopers reported that they typically use a fairly standard method of questioning after a stop that is designed to see if the driver had a plausible and consistent story, and also to156determine if the driver became less or more nervous across the course of the conversation. It is assumed that the non-combative and friendly general conversation should relax the driver. Troopers said a search would likely follow in three general scenarios: if there was probablecause\u2014for example, visible contraband or the smell of marijuana; if the conversation resulted intoo many inconsistencies; or the driver was still visibly nervous after the initial interview. In thelatter case, the interview method is a tool that produces reasonable suspicion that somethingmight be wrong. An excessively nervous or confused driver is viewed as more likely to be doing something wrong, therefore providing troopers with reasonable suspicions, and hence, a goodchoice for troopers to request a consent to search. The CIT members talked about writing a lot of warning tickets. Someone who was still nervous after having been written a warning ticket often heightens the suspicions of a trooper,because warning tickets are viewed as an outcome of the encounter that should relieve mostcitizens' anxiety. Although the CIT's primary task (and pride) centers on drug interdiction, thetroopers made it clear that their interview protocol was cued to nervousness and bodylanguage\u2014therefore making it a useful tool fo r identifying felons, people with outstanding warrants, or other violators. Some troopers in the focus groups recognized that the use ofnervousness might produce unreliable results, but the general tone was one of great faith in theirmethods of interdiction by conversation. In fact, the use of the interview method was seen ascounteracting any personal stereotypes (biases) one might have about drivers. The troopers also viewed their leadership to be intolerant of any racial bias. There was general agreement among the CIT members that certain cues are used to determine whether or not to gather additional information, and that these cues, in their totality,made some people seem more suspect than others. (We have referred earlier to decision making157processes based on incomplete information as a stereotyping process.) These troopers believed that their high standards for determining when to search (they noted that \"articulable andreasonable suspicion\" is required before a CIT member can request consent to search), theirmeticulous attention to recording information in detail, and their aggressively \"by the booksergeant\" have precluded racism or stereotyping among the CIT. We also discussed searches with regular road troopers. We did this, in part, because we had been struck by the extremely small number of searches attributed to them. We foundsearches among this group to be so rare as to simply not be part of a trooper's normal routine. The troopers we talked with were only a small fraction of the 1,200 or so troopers patrolling thestate highways, but to an individual they either claimed to do no searches, or claimed to search only reluctantly. At least part of that reluctance was attributed to safety concerns, becausetroopers patrol alone. A search would occur, they said, when contraband was visible or the driver had to be searched incident to arrest. Searches extend contact with a driver, and are thus seen asdangerous, because they could lead to a confrontation with the driver or occupants. Additionally,if contraband, especially of the type and volume they might be likely to encounter, was to bediscovered, it would lead to a great deal of undesirable paper work and potential time in court. The regular road troopers we talked to were not enthusiastic about searches in the least, and it isclear that they view unnecessary searches, in general, as a nonproductive use of their time. It alsoseems clear that the threshold at which a \"cue\" or \"indicator\" would rise to the level of reasonablesuspicion is high for regular road troopers. Given their accounts, we would expect that searches would be rare among regular troopers. This expectation will be confirmed shortly. In addition, the accounts given by the CITmembers seem consistent with practices that could produce some racial disparity in searches, but33 We ignore searches incidental to an arrest because we assume that if there is sufficient cause to arrest someone, the search of the person is perfunctory from the point of view ofwhether or not there is disparity. While there may be some bias in arrest procedures, it is simplybeyond the scope of this report to assess such processes (as we have no data to assess). Wethink, however, that there are some checks and balances in the criminal justice system regardingcases brought to court with insufficient evidence. Presumably a trooper who repeatedly arrestswithout sufficient cause would come to the attenti on of prosecutors and of his or her superiors. While such checks and balances are undoubtedly imperfect, it is simply beyond the scope of thisresearch to address such cases. 158not wholesale racial profiling. The CIT accounts look more like cognitive bias processes, perhaps exaggerated by the routine use of what we refer to as stereotypes, to decide whom to stop but notwhom to search. Since the interview method is an interactional and a conversationalaccomplishment, it seems reasonable to suspect that the cues and indicators (stereotypes) builtinto the process, and cognitive bias\u2014both individual and organizational\u2014might influence notonly the interaction, but also the interpretation of the interview's outcome in ways thatdisadvantage some, but not all, of the persons stopped. Of course, the conversational method isbiased inherently against anyone who is nervous, confused, or belligerent. We know from priorresearch and Chapter 6 of this report that African Americans have lower levels of trust in the police. This may lead in some instances to nervousness in its own right. Throughout the discussion below, a distinction will be made between consent searches and probable cause searches.33 For a consent search, as the name suggests, a search cannot be conducted if the person in question refuses to grant permission for the search. Yet there must begrounds for suspicion of the person. For a probable cause search, no such permission is needed asthe trooper has seen sufficient evidence to warrant the search, such as drug paraphernalia or aweapon. However, in our conversations with CIT troopers, it was stated that often it was thepractice in a probable cause situation for a trooper to ask for permission for the search since aconsent search would lessen the subsequent chance that the trooper would be accused of159fabricating the probable cause evidence (also, by asking permission to search, the trooper might be perceived as being more respectful and therefore less likely to antagonize the suspect). Whether or not the trooper recorded a specific event as a probable cause or a consent search is notclear. Still, we suspect that during the years of this study, some searches recorded as consentsearches were in fact probable cause searches. Unfortunately, any shifts of this sort make itdifficult to evaluate trends in probable cause and consent searches. To the extent that the troopers we interviewed capture general NCSHP activity, the above discussion suggests that regular road troopers should record a higher proportion of probable cause searches\u2014because of their general reluctance to search and their higher threshold for articulablesuspicion. That would lead us to expect them to also record higher proportions of searchesresulting in the seizure of contraband. The CIT troopers, on the other hand, note that searches arebased on the results of the interaction with the driver (articulable and reasonable suspicionincluding nervousness and other signs related to the car or driver), and of course, probable cause,such as visible contraband. Thus, we might exp ect a higher proportion of consent searches and a lower rate for identifying contraband among the CIT. Recorded Search Activity In this section we analyze the incidence and distribution of searches recorded by the NCSHP. We contrast the activity of the CIT and other NCSHP troopers during the 1997-2000period. We think it is important to recognize that in 1996, the CIT came under public scrutiny forracial profiling in searches. It is reasonable to suspect that the fairly dramatic change in searchbehavior in both the CIT and among other troopers soon after was, in part, a response to thatscrutiny.160Figure 4.1 displays separate time trends for recorded searches by the CIT and all other NCSHP troopers. As shown, the CIT conducts substantially more searches than other troopers. In 1997, for example, the CIT recorded 769 searches, while the largest other troop recorded sixty-two searches. In 2000, the comparable numbers were 387 and 110. There was a rapid decline insearches by the CIT across the period. The number of troopers assigned to the CIT declinedacross this period as well, dropping from twenty-five active troopers in 1997, to thirteen in theyear 2000. These troopers were averaging thirty-one searches per year in 1997, and thirty in2000. Outside the CIT, many troopers record doing no searches in a typical year. Many of thetroopers who do report searches average only one or two per year. Regular road troopers slightlyincreased their volume of searches in 1998. There was a small decline in searches by regulartroopers after 1998.161Figure 4.1 Searches by CIT and Non-CIT NCSHP Troopers 162 Figure 4.2 shows the time trends in the proportion of all recorded searches of African Americans. There was a sharp decline in the proportion African Americans searched in 1998 forboth CIT and non-CIT troopers. The percent Afri can American increases somewhat for both non- CIT troopers in 1999, and for CIT troopers in 2000. As we have seen in earlier chapters, about 20percent of drivers are estimated to be African American. In 1997, 46 percent of searches by theCIT were of African Americans and slightly more than 30 percent of searches by non-CITtroopers were of African Americans. In order to ascertain if this rate of searches of African Americans is excessive, we need to establish a baseline of drivers at risk to be sear ched. Because drivers are searched after they are stopped, a reasonable baseline is the racial composition of drivers stopped. The baseline used inTable 4.1 and Figure 4.3 is measured at the troop level. Except for the CIT, other troops areidentified by a fictitious identification number. This baseline is potentially misleading to theextent that the few troopers who actually conduct many searches may patrol in areas within theirtroop's territory with higher or lower concentrations of African American drivers. This potential problem is not present for the CIT, since all troopers actively search cars. Later, we repeat theseanalyses at the individual trooper level and use the trooper's own distribution of citations andwarnings as the baseline to compare with the racial distribution of searches.163Figure 4.2 African Americans as Percent of Searches, CIT and Non-CIT NCSHP Troopers 2000 1999 1998 1997Percent of Searches.5 .4 .3.2 .1 Other NCSHP CIT TROOP164We use combined data on the racial composition of warnings and citations for 1998-2000 to establish a baseline of drivers at risk to be searched. For 1997, only citations are available, andso we use the racial composition of citations as our baseline estimate of who is at risk to besearched. As we saw in Chapters 1 and 2, the racial composition of warnings and citations tendsto be very similar. In previous chapters, we have examined variation in racial disparity for thefifty-three troop districts in North Carolina. Sear ch events are much too rare to be analyzed at this level. We use instead the eight regular NCSHP troops plus the CIT as the organizationalunits. Table 4.1 displays the racial composition of drivers stopped and searched for these ninetroops for 1997. Many troops recorded very few searches in 1997. In all troops except Troop 7,African Americans are a higher proportion of search es than they are of drivers stopped and cited. In all troops, including 7, whites were searched at lower rates than they were stopped in 1997. The next to last column displays the relative odds of being searched after being stopped and compares African Americans and whites ([African American searches/stops] / [whitesearches/stops]). For all troops in 1997, African Americans have higher odds of being searchedthan do whites, although the magnitude of this increased risk varies tremendously across troops. At the low end, in Troop 8, African Americans were 1.27 times more likely than whites to besearched after a stop. Troop 7 is almost as low, at 1.33. These two troops record very fewsearches. At the other end of the distributi on for 1997, CIT members searched African Americans who had been stopped at more than four times the rate of whites. Although only 48 searches wererecorded by Troop 1 during 1997, African American drivers were searched at four times the rateof white drivers. For 1997 across the NCSHP, there is substantial racial disparity in searches.165Table 4.1. Comparisons of Baseline Estimates of Driver s Stopped (Cited) and Drivers Sear ched for African Americans and Whites in North Carolina by Troop, 1997 Troop Percent African American StoppedPercent African American SearchesPercent White StoppedPercent White SearchedOddsRatio (African American /(White Searches CIT 22.4 77.4 28.0 61.0 52.0 1.27 25 One of the most striking things about Table 4.1 is that, with the exception of the CIT, the NCSHP does not routinely search vehicles. At the organizational level, if racial profiling accounted for the observed disparity in 1997, regular road troopers were not involved. Whileindividual troopers in these units may have been using a racially influenced drug offenderprofiling method, troops as a whole were simply not in the search business. Because there have been dramatic changes in the search behavior of NCSHP troopers since 1997, it is appropriate to see if these racial disparities in search rates are stable over time. Figure 4.3 displays the time trends in the relative odds of African American to white searches for166the four NCSHP troops recording thirty or more stops in two or more years. Across the whole period, the vast majority of troops record very few searches. Figure 4.3 Trends in Relative Odds of Black/White Searches, Troopers with 30 or More Searches for Two or More Years 0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.0 1997 1998 1999 2000Odds Ratio6 1 3 CIT167In addition to the CIT troop (I), only a single troop was heavily involved in searches across the years. The time trends are quite dramatic for all four troops. In 1998, there is a sharpdrop in the relative odds of African Americans bei ng searched for all four troops with thirty or more searches. By 1999, Troop 6 recorded only twenty-four searches and the time series ends. Clearly the NCSHP not only drastically reduced the number of searches it conducted in 1998, italso searched African Americans at lower rates. It is still the case across the entire period,however, that for the few troops with substantial search activity (as defined here), the NCSHPsearches African Americans at higher rates than it stops them. The patterns are not the same for each troop. The CIT's racial disparity in searches drops dramatically from 1997 to 1998, and plateaus with an African American/white odds ratio of about2:1. Prior to 1998, the CIT had a very high racial disparity in search rates that, on its face, isconsistent with a practice of racial profiling. By 1998, its level of racial disparity was muchsmaller and was also lower than the other two troops examined. This pattern looks very similar tothe time trends for the CIT reported in Figures 4.1 and 4.2. After 1997, the CIT searched fewerdrivers and especially fewer African American dr ivers. The disproportionate searches of African Americans by the CIT reported in the press in 1996 and still present in 1997, quickly eroded in1998. This suggests a dramatic shift in selection criteria for whom to search, with race playing amuch smaller role after 1997. In 1997, African Americans stopped by troopers in Troop 1 were four times more likely to be searched than were whites who had been stopped. Although these odds dropped dramaticallyin 1998, they rose to three times the white odds in 1999 and 2000.168Troop 3 shows an even more dramatic pattern. In 1997, Troop 3 recorded less than thirty searches. Therefore, its time series begins in 1998, with an odds ratio just below 2.This thenclimbs slightly to 2.3 in 1999, and jumps to 6.5 in 2000. In the year 2000, African Americansaccount for 44.1 percent of the cars searched by Troop 3, but only 28.3 percent of those stopped. While this is a substantial disparity, more striking is the very low rate of white searches. Whilewhites made up 69.4 percent of stops by the troopers of Troop 3, they account for only 14.7percent of those searched. People of other races were 10 percent of stops and 32 percent of those searched by troopers in Troop 1. There remains evidence that African Americans are searched at twice the rate of whites by troopers of the CIT in the year 2000, but this represents a dramatic decline since 1997. Themuch lower racial disparity in searches is consistent with the abandoning of racial profilingpractices, or increased reliance on nonracial driv er indicators by the CIT, given the accounts of how the CIT make their search decisions. The remaining disparity could easily be generated bystereotyping and the use of the conversational method for generating suspicion prior to asking forconsent to search. It is also possible that the remaining disparity is produced by some non-biasprocess that we have not accounted for. The other two troops showing substantial search activity in 2000, search African Americans at higher rates relative to whites who have been stopped. Because very few of thetroopers in these troops ever search a car, it does not suggest racial profiling at the troop level. Individual troopers could be racial profiling, however.169Figure 4.4 Probable Cause as a Proportion of CIT and Non-CIT Searches, 1997-2000 2000 1999 1998 1997Proportion of Searches.4 .3 .2.1 0.0 Non-CIT CIT170Probable Cause versus Consent Searches Consent searches have been identified in other jurisdictions as the most likely search type to exhibit racial disparity. Certainly the visi ble presence of contraband leading to probable cause leaves little room for bias, although, of course, some situations attributable to probable cause maybe more subjective (for example, a strange odor). When a trooper's \"sense\" about drivers,including nervousness, influences a request for consent to search, much more room for bias isprovided. Figure 4.4 compares the proportion of probable cause searches for both the CIT and other NCHSP troopers. In 1997, less than 10 percent of searches were attributed to probable cause. Probable cause searches rose rapidly across the period. By 2000, 37 percent of CIT searches and20 percent of other troopers' searches were based on reported probable cause. Based upon ourinterviews, we had expected to find that searches by regular troopers would be more likely thanthose by the CIT to have probable cause attributed to a search. This was not the case. In 1977,both the CIT and regular troopers who recorded searches rarely reported probable cause (10percent). After 1998, the CIT was more likely than the few regular troopers conducting searchesto record probable cause for a search. Because regular troopers rarely search, it may be the casethat probable cause searches are under-recorded. It may also be the case that the CIT have madea greater effort to selectively search and, in so doing, are less inclined to request consent withoutsubstantial reason. Figures 4.5 and 4.6 compare the racial/ethnic proportion of probable causesearches across the same period. 171Figure 4.5 presents searches initiated by CIT members. In 1997, African American and white drivers are equally unlikely to have probable cause attributed to the search. After 1997, forboth white and African American drivers probable cause becomes more common, although theline is much steeper for African Americans. This chart also includes searches of people of otherraces and Hispanics combined. These represent only forty of the 387 CIT searches in 2000, andshow the same basic pattern of increased probable cause, although consent searches are evenmore prevalent among CIT member searches of drivers who are neither white nor AfricanAmerican. The decline in the use of consent searches is consistent with a decline in the influenceof federal guidelines for drug interdiction by the CIT.

Searches attributed to probable cause increased dramatically in the searches of African Americans by regular NCSHP troopers. Surprisingly, the trends for white and \"other race\" stops are not so clear. If the decreasedsearches of African Americans and the decreased use of consent searches is a reaction to the 1996charges of racial disparity, it seems to have changed the behavior of the CIT troopers for searchesregardless of the race of the driver. For other troopers, consent searches seem to have declinedonly for African Americans. Although we do not report separate graphs here, the racial composition of probable cause searches has not declined, while the proportion African Americanamong consent searches has declined since 1997 for both CIT and regular troopers' searches. Thus, the decline in searches of African Americans documented in Figure 2 occurred entirelybecause of the decline of consent searches. Our analysis of the incidence of probable cause reveals that between 1997 and 2000, probable cause searches became a higher proportion of all searches, as the use of consent searchesdeclined. This pattern is particularly strong among the CIT members, and this occurred across allracial/ethnic groups compared in the CIT analysis. Regular road troopers do few searches andhave dramatically reduced the use of consent searches of African American drivers\u2014but not ofwhite or \"other race\" drivers. The prediction based on troopers accounts that the CIT wouldmake more use of consent searches is not supported by these analyses. Of course, the vastmajority of regular troopers conduct few or no searches.34 There are issues of social efficiency around absolute hit rates that should be recognized as well. Even if there are no racial disparities, if hit rates are low, then many innocent drivers arebeing searched. The question then becomes at what level of hit rate is the trade-off between theinvasion of innocent citizens' privacy and potential drug interdiction acceptable? 174Hit Rates Hit rates, or the proportion of searches whic h result in the successful identification and seizure of contraband, are potentially useful indicat ors of racial disparity in search decisions. If troopers are searching minorities at higher rates because of race rather than because they havegood professional reasons to suspect contraband, th en we would expect that a lower proportion of minority vehicles will be found to contain contraband. Essentially, in the presence of raciallybiased search decisions, we expect more innocent minorities to be searched than innocentwhites. 34 Examining hit rates by race will provide some insight as to the likelihood that the search decision may be influenced by race over and above the magnitude of reasonable suspicion. Figure 4.7 shows the hit rates for the CIT searches. In 1997, the proportion of searches that generated contraband were quite a bit lower for searches of African American and \"otherrace\" drives than the hit rate for white drivers. The hit rate for \"other race\" drivers isconsiderably lower than for either African American or white searches. To the extent that raceplayed a part in the determination of who to search, these results would suggest that CIT trooperswere quite unsuccessful in their predictions and choices related to search decisions. The whiteand African American rates converge across the period. While the hit rate for \"other race\" driversdoes rise, it still remains lower than that of the other two groups. These results overall showsubstantial racial disparity in the success rate for searches for 1997. This effect seems to havedisappeared after 1998, as fewer African American drivers have been searched and fewer consent searches have been initiated by CIT members. Given that the CIT hit rates for African American175and white drivers converged after 1998, the hit rate s for searches of African Americans after 1998 surpass those of whites after 1998, and that the racial disparity in searches has droppeddramatically, the evidence points to earlier disadvantage for African Americans, possibly as aresult of racially influenced practices by the CIT in 1997, but little or no disparity in currentsearch practices. Figure 4.7 Proportion of CIT Searches Yielding Contraband By Race, 1997-2000 2000 1999 1998 1997Proportion of Searches.4 .3 .2.1 0.0Black Other Race White176Figure 4.8 Proportion of Non-CIT Searches Yielding Contraband By Race, 1997-2000 2000 1999 1998 1997Proportion of Searches.6 .5.4.3.2 .1 Black Other Race White177Figure 4.8 reports the same basic data for searches by the rest of the NCSHP. For all years, hit rates are higher for whites who were searched than for African Americans or drivers ofother races. After 1998, the hit rates rise for searches of both African American and whitedrivers, reflecting the lower use of consent searches documented above. If there is any evidenceof convergence in African American and white hit rates, it does not occur until the year 2000. There is no evidence of convergence in hit rates for drivers of other races. Although regularNCSHP troopers do very few searches, and these searches are concentrated by 2000 in only twotroops and among five troopers, there is evidence not only of continued racial disparity insearches, but also of lower rates of contraband found in minority searches. Individual Trooper Analyses The analyses of search disparity reported a bove suggest that, outside of the CIT, a few troopers may be responsible for the disproporti onate searching of African American vehicles relative to the proportion African Americans stopped. Inside the CIT, there is evidence of somerace-linked disparity in searches, although it is much reduced compared to earlier years. In bothcases, however, we used the racial composition of stops at the troop level as the baseline. Sincethere could easily be spatial and temporal heterogeneity within troops as discussed in previouschapters, these higher odds of African American searches may simply reflect where and whentroopers patrol, rather than some racial disparity in search decisions. In the year 2000, there were sixteen troopers with fifteen or more searches. These troopers include members of the CIT and the handf ul of regular NCSHP troopers who are actively (by our measure) searching vehicles. Three of the sixteen showed no excess searches of African35 There are an additional five troopers who had odds ratios above 1 but below 2. As stated in the main text, there are eight troopers who have odds above 2, suggesting they searchAfrican Americans at or above twice the rate of white drivers. Two of these troopers had oddsratios above 4, suggesting that they search African Americans at least four times as often aswhites, given the number of African Americans and whites they stop for routine drivingviolations. The absolute number of searches is not high, ranging between 1 and 5 per month. Given these low absolute number of searches it is even possible that for any one of theseindividuals the disproportionate search of Af rican Americans happened by chance. Also, the low numbers prohibit addressing \"selection effect\" interpretations of the data, such as time ofday, day of week, and spatial heterogeneity concerns. Moreover, it should be noted that we haveno information on the circumstances under which these searches are conducted. For example,these select few troopers may be called to the scene of an stop made by another trooper, and arecalled in because of their expertise in conducting vehicular searches. As such, the selectionmechanisms for their searches may be quite different from that of other troopers. 178Americans compared to those of whites, when using the trooper's own racial distribution of citations and warnings as the baseline from which to compare the racial distribution of searches. Although the number of searches per trooper in 2000 is low, eight of the troopers had odds ratiosof higher than 2, suggesting that they search African Americans at or above twice the rate ofwhich they search white drivers. Given the raci al distributions of citations and warnings, these troopers display a slightly elevated proportion of searches of African Americans relative to whitesearches. This suggests some racial disparity in the decision to search African Americans'vehicles. 35 Conclusion There is considerable evidence in this chapter that there was a decline in search activity by the NCSHP after 1997, and that much of this decline arose from searching fewer AfricanAmericans. In 1997, the vast majority of searches were recorded as consent rather than probablecause searches, leaving more room for trooper discretion in whom to search. In 1997, all troopssearched a higher proportion of African Americans than they did whites, although this varied179from slightly higher odds of an African American search, to four times the odds in the CIT and in Troop 1. Across the period, there is considerable evidence of changes in the search-decisionprocess of the CIT. The African American-to- white odds of a search fell from four-to-one in 1997, to two-to-one thereafter. The use of consent searches declined for all racial groups, andAfrican American and white hit rates converged, and, significantly, the hit rate for AfricanAmerican searches surpassed that for whites after 1998. Although the CIT search data suggestthat the drug interdiction profiles used prior to 1998 were possibly not unrelated to race, from1998 on, the disproportionate searches of African Americans, to the extent they are related torace, is more likely to arise from the use of stereotypes or the residual nervousness of AfricanAmerican drivers during the \"interview method\" used to develop reasonable suspicion. The convergence of African American and white hit rates suggests that the CIT is not searching ahigher proportion of innocent African Americans than innocent whites. Although there is clearimprovement in hit rates, a higher proportion of \"other race\" drivers who are searched are notfound to be holding contraband. The pattern and extent of searches is different for regular NCSHP troopers. First, the vast majority of troopers do few or no searches. In fact, the vast majority of troops do less than thirtysearches in a year. Two troops consistently generate more than thirty searches in a year and alsosearch African Americans at relatively high ra tes. In the year 2000, five individual troopers accounted for almost all of the search activity in these two troops. In addition, hit rates forsearches are consistently lower for African American and \"other race\" drivers who are searchedby regular NCSHP troopers, suggesting that higher minority search rates are not, in fact, founded on the same level of reasonable suspicion.180The basic conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that the vast majority of NCHSP troopers do no searches and so cannot be racially profiling in the search decision. To the extentthat earlier charges of CIT profiling may have desc ribed search practices at that time, we find no substantiation for that claim at present. The anal ysis of individual troopers suggests that there are eight troopers with high levels of African American -white disparity in search behavior. It should be recalled, that even for these eight troopers there may be unmeasured and non-biasedexplanations for the observed higher searches of African Americans. While these numbers shouldnot be ignored by NCSHP administration, they likewise should not be viewed as proof of profiling given the limited information on the trooper-citizen contact available for analysis. 181Chapter 5 Citizen Survey Results: Racial Disparity in Self-Reported Stops Whereas the earlier chapters focused on official records, this chapter reports the results of an analysis of police stop experiences using citizen self-reports from the North Carolina DriverSurvey. We find evidence of racial disparity in self-reported stops, after controls for drivercharacteristics and reported driver behavior. Local police were found to exhibit a higher level ofracial disparity than does the NCSHP. Af rican Americans also report being stopped for somewhat more discretionary reasons and, to a sma ll but significant extent, being treated with less respect during stops. There are no racial differences in the relative incidence of citations, writtenwarnings, and verbal warnings. The evidence in this chapter, based on self-reported data, pointstoward greater racial disparity in the stop decision than in the interaction after the stop. Introduction The North Carolina Driver Survey was designed to complement the official statistics we have discussed previously. Official statistics are essentially the officers' recorded accounts of citizen-officer encounters. When all encounters are recorded, they can provide exceptional dataon the racial distribution of stops. Official da ta do not contain very much information on driver characteristics, especially the ability to determine if drivers who are stopped report differentdriving practices or behavior than those who are not stopped. If most drivers break the driving laws at some time, then there may be substantial officer discretion in deciding whom to stop. Where discretion is larger, so is the opportunity for racialbias in the stop decision to enter into the process. The official data we have been examining182focuses on the NCSHP. The various local police forces operating in North Carolina actually stop more drivers than does the NCSHP. The survey data allow us to capture drivers' self-reports ofall stops by all police and to make distinctions between stops by the NCSHP and those by officersattached to other police forces. The survey data also allows us to collect information on typical driving behaviors that may influence the probability of being stopped. In the survey we not only asked North Carolinadrivers whether or not they were stopped, but also why they were stopped, the outcome of thestop, and whether or not they felt that they were treated with respect during the stop. Finally, the survey allows us to explore the linkages among race, stop experiences, and self-reports of drivingpractice and behavior. Sample Characteristics The North Carolina Driver Survey is a telephone survey of a stratified random sample of current North Carolina licensed drivers. The sample was stratified by race in order to havesufficient sample sizes to compare the experiences of white and African American drivers. Thesampling frame included white and African American drivers who had applied for or renewedtheir licenses in the pervious six months. Using this method we had expected to get phonenumbers and addresses that were relatively current. Unfortunately, it turns out that the N. C.Department of Motor Vehicles rarely asks for the telephone number, nor does it require proof ofhome address for license renewals. Thus, we had to use a telephone match based on surname andaddress to develop useful contact information for our sampling frame. The return on thetelephone match was 48.6 percent, lowest for African American females at 39.0 percent and183highest for white males at 62.8 percent. Cooperation rates on the survey were much better at 59.1 percent, with a high for African American females of 61.8 percent and a low for white males of56.5 percent. Data were collected between June 22, 2000, and March 20, 2001. Half of the caseswere collected by September 11, 2000. A comparison of our final sample to the actual race-gender-age distribution of licensed drivers in North Carolina shows that our final sample is quite a good match to the statedistributions (see Table 5.1). In all four gender-race groups, young adults age 30-39 are underrepresented. In most statistical analyses we weight the data to correspond to the known genderand age distributions of licensed drivers within the two racial strata. We call this the \"DMV weight\" because it refers to the distribution of dr ivers in the N.C. Department of Motor Vehicles' license registry. Racial Differences in Stops One of the primary goals of the survey is to see if there are racial differences in the probability of police stops. Because police are expected to respond to driver behavior in makingthe decision to stop, we also collected informa tion from respondents about their typical driving behavior. Information on other attributes of the driver that may motivate police stops or influence driving behavior such as age, gender, education, home ownership, and car model and age wascollected.184Table 5.1 Age, Gender, and Racial Distribution of Su rvey Respondents and North Carolina Registered Drivers, 2000. African American White Survey Percent DMV Percent Survey Percent DMV Percent Males 18-29 12.4 13.3 9.3 10.2Males 30-39 9.4 11.8 8.7 10.7Males 40-49 11.5 10.3 10.9 10.2Males 50-59 7.2 6.2 9.1 8.1Males 60+ 6.6 6.0 10.4 10.3Females 18-29 14.3 13.5 10.2 9.8Females 30-39 8.6 12.6 9.1 10.4Females 40-49 13.7 11.5 11.8 10.2Females 50-59 8.2 7.1 8.9 8.3Females 60+ 9.3 7.6 11.9 11.6 We were concerned about potential reporting errors in response to our questions about police stops and driving behavior. Being stoppe d by the police for speeding or other reasons is potentially embarrassing. It is well known in survey research that respondents tend to under-report embarrassing behaviors. As described in Appendix E, we conducted a record check surveyof almost 600 drivers with known speeding stops in the last year in order to ascertain the degreeof under-reporting of stops we could expect in the driver survey. The record check surveyshowed that 74.8 percent of whites admitted being stopped in the last year. For AfricanAmericans the number was 66.8 percent. This racial difference in self-reports is statisticallysignificant at a .019 probability. These results suggest that in the larger driver survey we wouldexpect to find respondents who claimed no stops in the past year, but who were in fact stopped. And, while both groups under-report speeding stops, African Americans do so at a higher rate. This finding is consistent with many past studies that report stronger social desirability effects on survey responses among African Americans. Thus, the North Carolina Driver Survey data willtend to underestimate the number of stops for both African Americans and whites and it will also36 The record check survey also shows that people who do not report a stop also report fewer risky driving behaviors and less speeding. For non-threatening questions such as miles driventhere are no differences between those who report stops and those who do not. 37 Given these record check results, we weight white respondents who admit to stops at 1.34228 (1/.78) and African American respondents who admit to stops are weighted at 1.4947 (1/.68). This requires weighting whites and African Americans who do not admit to stops at less than onein order to preserve the original sample size. These weights are .9245 for whites who do notreport stops and .8228 for African Americans who do not report stops. 185underestimate the magnitude of the racial disparity in stops. 36 In most analyses we present results that have been weighted to reflect the expected racial difference in non-response to the questionsabout stops. 37 We refer to these analyses as using the Record Check weights. In general, the record check weights increase our estimates of the number of stops and increase the racialdisparity in stops, but should more closely mirror the actual racial gap in stop experiences. Comparison of Driver Survey Estimates of Stops to Official Records There are reasons to believe a driver survey might underestimate the actual number of stops and other reasons to suspect they might overestimate the actual number of stops (seeBradburn 1983). From the record check survey, we developed race-specific estimates of the degree of under-reporting, and we can use those estimates to weight the data to correct for thispossible source of under-reporting. In the survey we asked respondents to recall the stops theyhad experienced over the last year. Survey questions that ask the respondent to recall events arealso subject to telescoping errors in which respondents report on events that actually took placeoutside time period parameters specified in the survey question. In our case we ask for stops inthe last year. If telescoping is occurring, weighting the data to correct for under-reporting mayproduce larger estimates of the number of the stops in the last year than actually occurred. To the186extent that telescoping is associated with race, our estimates of racial differences in stops may be effected. In the Table 5.2 we produce population estimates of stops by the NCSHP in the last year from the North Carolina Driver Survey with DMV weights and with Record Check weights. Wecompare these to the estimates of stops from the official 2000 citation records of NCSHPtroopers. The citation estimates from the NCSHP trooper's citation reports are very similar to those based on the survey responses using DMV weights. For both African American and whitecitation estimates the actual NCSHP citation count is within a single standard deviation of thesurvey estimates using the DMV weights. When the record check weights are used for bothAfrican American and white drivers, the survey estimates of citations are much higher than therecorded citations in the NCSHP citation reports. These analyses suggest that the point estimatesbased on the DMV weights are surprisingly accurate. Given the under-reporting we found in the record check survey, we would have expected that the record check weights would have been closer to the official records. It would appear that reports that telescope the time period are prevalent, and that telescoping over-reporting andrefusal-to-admit-a-stop underreporting roughly cancel each other out. In general, this suggeststhat the yearly incidence of stops is best captured by the DMV weighted data.187Table 5.2 Comparison of Survey and Offici al Record Estimates of African American and White Total Citations in Past Year Survey Population Estimate of NCSHP Citations in Last YearConfidence Interval at 66 Percent Confidence LevelConfidence Interval at 95 Percent Confidence LevelEstimate from NCSHP 2000 Citation Reports African American Drivers DMV Weights 112,22899,986 to 124,47087,744 to 136,715 101,909 Record Check Weights 167,685152,947 to 182,423138,208 to 197,162 Drivers DMV Weights 274,066248,220 to 299,912222,374 to 325,758 294,241 Record Check Weights 368,597338,976 to 398,218309,355 to 427,839 The Record Check weights may do a better job of capturing the racial gap in self-reports, since they incorporate information from the Record Check survey on racial differences in theprobability to report stops in a survey. These estimates probably refer now to a period closer toeighteen months. We also use the Record Check weights in the multivariate analyses that followbecause risky driving behaviors, are associated with the failure to report a stop in the record checkanalyses, and are some of the primary presumed legitimate causes of stops in the multivariatemodels below. Racial Differences in the Reported Stop Experience Table 5.3 reports the race-gender-age distributi on of stops from the North Carolina Driver Survey. These distributions are for drivers who self-report being African American or white and are weighted to correspond to the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles distributions of38 Although we sampled only people who were listed as African American or white in the DMV records a few respondents claimed other ethnic/r acial affiliations. These people are dropped from the analyses. A few people refused to answer the race question, these were assigned the DMVrace and kept in the analyses. The original sample somewhat underestimates people in the 30-39age group for all four race-gender categories. The DMV2000 weights correct for theseunderestimates. 188age and gender within race.38 Young drivers tend to have more stops than older drivers and African American male drivers tend to be stopped more often than white drivers. Young African American drivers report an average of 1.24 stops in the past year, almost twice as many as young white drivers. Almost all of the racial disparity in stops among youngmale drivers is produced by stops by local police. NCSHP stops of young African American maledrivers (17.0 percent) and young white male drivers (15.5 percent) are very similar. This samepattern holds up for older male drivers. In all cases there are racial disparities in stops, but theracial disparity is larger for local police than it is for the NCSHP. It is also the case that while the absolute probability of being stopped drops for African American and white males as they age,the relative racial disparity in stops (the odds ratio of African American to white stops) tends torise with age, especially for stops by the local police. Table 5.3. Male Age and Race Distribution of Stops from the North Carolina Driver Survey, 2000.

Women tend to be stopped less often than men at all ages and among both AfricanAmericans and whites. Among women, police stop experiences also decline with age. YoungAfrican American women report about a third as many stops as young African American men. Young white women report about half as many stops as young white men. As among men, thereare racial disparities in stops and the disparity is larger in stops by local police than in stops bythe NCSHP. In fact, among young women, white women report slightly more stops by theNCSHP than do African American women. While among older women African Americans reportmore stops by the NCSHP, the racial disparity is very small. For local police, the relative racialdisparity in stops as measured by the odds ratio increases dramatically with age. Very few olderwhite women are ever stopped by the local police, while 9.6 percent of older African Americanwomen report stops in the last year by local police officers. Table 5.4.

In order to make good use of the sample sizes available, statistics are compared for white and African American North Carolina drivers across all age and gender groups. In multivariatemodels that follow we statistically adjust for gender, age, and other factors that may explain theracial gap in police stops. Slightly more than a quarter (26.4 percent) of African American North Carolina drivers reported a stop in the last year as compared to 18.1 percent of whites. African Americans are 8.3percent more likely than whites to report being stopped by the police. African Americans arestopped more often (total stops average .43 versus .25), are 7.6 percent more likely to be stoppedby the local police, and are 1.3 percent more likely to be stopped by the NCSHP. All of theseracial disparities in stops, except stops by the NCSHP, are statistically significant. The National Institute of Justice recently released national survey estimates of racial differences in driver stops by police. Their self-report data on police stops show 10.4 percent ofwhite drivers and 12.3 percent of African American drivers reporting a stop in the last year. This suggests that the overall rate of police stops in North Carolina is almost twice the nationalaverage. The racial gap in stops by local police is also quite a bit higher in North Carolina than inthe rest of the country. Stated another way the self-reported racial gap in police stops by theNCSHP is about half of the national average, but the racial gap in reported stops by local police inNorth Carolina is almost four times greater than the national average. This may suggest that localpolice more aggressively enforce traffic laws in North Carolina. It is also quite possible that thenational study understated the actual rate of stops.39 Using the 1999 National Transportation Survey, we compared self-reported miles driven in the last year by African Americans and whites for the nine major census divisions. In every region ofthe country, whites drive more on average than African Americans. The gap was largest in theWest North Central and New England regions\u2014at more than 6,800 miles per year and lowest inthe Middle Atlantic and Mountain states\u2014at less than 1,000 miles per year. The estimate for theEast South Central region, which includes North Carolina, was that African Americans drive 5,400 fewer miles per year than do whites. 191Racial Differences in Reported Driving Behavior One of the advantages of a survey approach is that we can collect information on reported driving behavior. If there are racial differences in typical driving behavior they may explain some of the observed differences in police stops. The third panel of Table 5.5 displays racialdifferences in driving behaviors. The first two entries refer to miles driven. It seems reasonableto predict that people who drive more are at gr eater risk of being stopped by the local police. This risk could be based simply on increased opportunity to encounter police officers. Inaddition, if most people occasionally break the driving laws, more driving increases theprobability that a person would encounter a police officer while breaking the law. On averagewhites drove significantly more miles in the last week and across the last year than did AfricanAmericans. Whites average more than 3,000 more miles per year than African Americans. 39 Thus, miles driven cannot explain the racial gap in stops. Another way to think about the racial gap in stops is to ask how many miles the average white or African American drives before be ing stopped. On average, North Carolina African American drivers drive 32,681 miles before being stopped. Whites in North Carolina reportdriving more than twice as far\u201468,944 miles per stop. Whites are also significantly more likelythan African Americans to drive on interstate highways.40 The one exception is displayed in the table. Whites are significantly more likely to say they typically drive 40 mph or above in a 35 mph speed zone than are African Americans. 192In terms of breaking the traffic laws, whites report slightly higher average speeds in 65, 55, and 35 mph speed zones. We experimented with various measures of speeding at thresholdsof 5, 6, 10, and 15 mph above the speed limit. In general there are no significant racialdifferences in self-reports of typically speeding at these thresholds. 40 In the multivariate analyses that follow, we use a three-item speeding scale based on a five mile per hour speeding thresholdfor three hypothetical speed limits\u201435 mph in town, 55 mph on a two-lane highway, and 65 mphon an interstate highway. We chose this measurement because it was more highly correlated withthe probability of a stop than alternative measures of speeding behavior. Because there are noaverage racial differences in self-reported speedi ng behaviors this variable cannot account for the racial disparity in police stops. We also asked drivers if they used methods to avoid getting stopped for speeding. Very few drivers use any method to reduce the chance of being stopped, although cruise control is mostcommon. Whites were significantly more likely than African Americans to report using cruisecontrol, listening to a CB-radio, and watching and monitoring the speed of commercial trucks. There were no racial differences in the use of radar detectors. If these methods reduce the risk ofbeing stopped they may account for some of the racial disparity in police stops observed in thesedata. In the multivariate analyses we use an additive scale called \"Methods to Avoid SpeedingTickets\" based on these four items. High scores mean the respondent rarely uses these methods.A reliability analysis shows that these items are not highly correlated with each other. 193Table 5.5.

They did , so we repeat the multivariate analyses using record check weights to see if reluctance to report stops or bad driving behavior influences results. 194(1.31) (1.34) DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND New Driver (four or fewer years driving) 5.2% 1.7% Yes Age 41.00 (15.3)44.8 Car Typically Driven 93.02 (5.35)94.01 (5.01)Yes Rather they are functional alternatives. None are used frequently, although many people use one. Only 37.4 percent of drivers report never using any of these methods. Finally, we asked about a series of risky dr iving behaviors. African Americans reported significantly higher seat belt and turn signal use than did whites. They also reported lowerlikelihood of rolling through a stop sign or speeding up to get through a red light. There were nosignificant racial differences in lane-c hanging or passing on a two-lane highway. 41 For the multivariate analyses we created a scale of \"Risky Driving Behavior\" by summing these sixitems. Inter-item reliability is only moderate (Alpha=.45). African Americans report driving fewer miles, are less risky drivers in terms of reported driving behavior, and report driving slightly slower on average than do white North Carolinadrivers. White drivers, on the other hand, use more methods to avoid being pulled over by thepolice. These descriptive statistics suggest that the reported driving behavior is unlikely toprovide powerful explanations for the observed racial disparity in police stops. Because whites195report driving slightly worse than African Ameri cans, controlling for driving behavior is likely to increase the estimate of the size of the racial gap in stops in the multivariate models that follow. Racial Differences in Demographic Background The bottom panel of Table 5.5 compares African American and white drivers' demographic backgrounds. Here there are substan tial racial differences. African Americans are significantly more likely than whites to be inexperienced drivers. Compared to white drivers,African Americans are also on average younger, slightly less educated, less likely to own theirown home, live in more rural areas, and drive slightly older cars. These demographic differences are potentially important explanations of the racial disparity in police stops. The public concern with racial bias in police stops implies that policediscretion coupled with police reaction to driver's status attributes combine to produce racialdisparity in the pattern of stops. If this is a reasonable model of the causal process, then wewould expect that other status attributes that ar e associated with police perceptions of driver risk or dangerousness will also be associated with the decision to stop. In particular, we would expect males, younger drivers, and economically disadvantaged drivers to have higher probabilities ofstops. African American drivers tend to be slightly less likely to be male than white drivers, butto be younger, slightly less educated, less likely to own a home, and drive slightly older cars. Ifpolice stop decisions are influenced by status characteristics such as these they may explain someof the racial disparity in stops. In addition, in multivariate models we can see the extent to which driving behaviors explain status linked disparity in stops. To the extent that they do, police may be reacting todriving behavior rather than status attributes. St rong status attribute associations with stops after42 These models were estimated using only cases with no missing values. In addition, four cases were excluded because the respondent claimed not to have driven in the last year. Modelsinclude the key explanatory variables that we have available. Alternative operationalizations ofmiles driven and speeding were explored but t hose selected were the most strongly associated with the probability of stops. In addition, interactions between miles driven and risky behavior,methods to avoid tickets, and interstate frequency were explored for all three stop measures. Inno case were these interactions statistically significant. Finally, including a dummy variable forinexperienced driver in no cases increased the probability of being stopped in the last yearbeyond the effect of simple age. 196controlling for driving behavior suggests that police perceptions of status attributes such as race, gender, or age may be important direct influences on the decision to stop a car. Modeling Police Stops in a Multivariate Context The vast majority of drivers who experienced a stop were stopped only once in the previous year. For this reason we model the likelihood of a stop in a logistic regressionmultivariate framework. In this statistical framework a dependent variable, coded 1 to indicatethe presence of the outcome (in this case a stop in the last year) and 0 to indicate its absence (nostop), is regressed on a series of explanatory variables. The statistical model is estimated usingmaximum likelihood methods, and it predicts the log of the odds of the outcome occurring (1)versus not occurring (0) as the dependent variable. In the tables that follow we display theexponent of the log-odds coefficient which can be interpreted as the multiplicative change in theodds associated with a one unit change in the independent variable. So, for example, in Table 5.6,column 1, the reported odds coefficient associated with race is 1.63. This means that for AfricanAmerican drivers, their odds of being stopped by the police in the last year are 1.63 times higherthan that of white drivers. 42 Odds below one mean that the outcome is less likely. Odds above one mean that the outcome is more likely as such explanatory variables as race, age, or riskydriving behaviors increase. In addition, these multivariate models are all estimated twice, once197with data weighted to conform to the 2000 North Carolina DMV records of race-age-gender distributions of licensed drivers and then with a second weight based on the record check surveyto correct for racial differences in the under-reporting of stops. The logic of the analysis is to first establish the size of the racial disparity in stops. We then enter a series of demographic control variables to see if they help explain the observed racialdisparity in the first model. To the extent that these demographic variables are also associatedwith the probability of stops they, like race, are a ssociated either with driving behaviors or with police discretion in stops decisions. The third model introduces the series of self-reported drivingbehaviors. To the extent that these behaviors encourage police stop decisions they should besignificantly associated with stop outcomes. In addition, if status characteristics are associated with different driving behaviors, adding driv ing behaviors to the models should erode the coefficients associated with demographic stat us characteristics. If the coefficients for demographic background are not eroded then this suggests that police are often reacting todrivers' status characteristics rather than their typical driving behavior. The final set of models separates the analysis by race and allows us to see if police react to both demographic attributesand driving behavior similarly for white and African American drivers. All analyses are repeated for any stop in the past year, and for stops by the local police and the NCSHP. Table 5.6 displays the analyses of any stop in the last year. In the first model we see that the odds of an average African American driver in North Carolina being stopped at least once inthe last year is 1.63 times higher than it is for an average white North Carolina driver. Theestimate (weighted to account for non-responses from the record check survey) indicates that theAfrican American odds of being stopped are 2.03 times greater than whites. Because the record198check weights correct for under-reporting, but not for telescoping of the recall period, the latter racial gap refers to the odds of being stopped in the last year and half. Adding the demographic variables to the model, substantially increases the model Chi- Square suggesting that the odds of being stopped are strongly influenced by these non-racialstatus characteristics. The coefficient associated with race is reduced by about 10 percent usingboth sets of weights. The racial disparity in stops is still statistically significant. We also see thatwomen are .70 times less likely than men to have been stopped in the last year; that increasededucation is associated with increased incidence of stops; and that newer cars are stopped lessoften, as are older drivers. Rural areas, urban areas, and home ownership are not associated withthe likelihood of a stop.199Table 5.6.

Drivers who drive more miles in a year, those who typically drive using more risky driving behaviors and those whouse more methods to avoid getting speeding tickets all are stopped more often. Self-reportedspeeding behavior is not significantly associated with increased stops, although the coefficient is200in the correct direction. The result for methods to avoid getting tickets is at first surprising. Drivers who consciously try to avoid getting tickets are stopped more often than other drivers. Evidently these drivers know they are breaking the law, and their increased scanning behavior toreduce police contacts is not sufficient to offs et their increased speeding driving behavior. Because African Americans report driving fewer miles per year, less risky driving behavior, and are less likely to use methods to avoid speeding tickets than whites, the racecoefficient actually gets larger in Model 3. In the DMV-weighted models, after accounting fordemographic and driving behavior differences, th e odds that an African American was stopped in the last year are 1.71 times higher than they are for whites. When the data are weighted toaccount for potential non-response to stop questions the level of racial disparity rises to 2.15times higher odds of a stop if you are African Am erican. Driving behavior coefficients are substantively identical using both weighting system s, suggesting that social desirability effects on reports of stops and driving behavior are not large or systematic-enough to influence results. Introducing driving behavior reduces both the gender coefficient and the education coefficient to non-significance. This suggests that the higher likelihood of being stopped among men and among more highly educated drivers is a f unction of their driving behavior. The effects of driver age and year of vehicle are not similarly reduced, suggesting that police tend to react toolder drivers and newer cars in a more forgiving manner than they do to younger drivers andolder cars. These results also help highlight that police discretion in stop decisions are not limitedto race. There may also tend to be age and class biases in the stop decision of some policeofficers. In the last two columns the models are split by race to see if any of the factors that encourage or discourage police stops operate differe ntly for African American and white drivers. 201The only variable that affects the odds of bei ng stopped differently for African American and white drivers is \"miles driven.\" Driving more miles substantially increases the odds of a stop forwhites. Miles driven for African Americans seems to be unrelated to the likelihood of a stop. Since officers cannot observe the number of miles driven, this result suggests that for whites akey risk factor increasing the likelihood of a stop is miles of potential driving exposure to policesurveillance. For African Americans, their race seems to be a risk factor in its own right, a factormore powerful than miles driven. After accounting for other demographic factors which might attract police attention and driving behavior these models suggest that the degree of unexplained racial disparity, as measured as the relative odds-ratio of African American to white police stops is somewherebetween 1.71 and 2.15. This is a substantial level of unexplained racial disparity and so potentialracial bias in police stops. Table 5.7 presents an identical analysis except that it is limited to stops by local police officers. In Model 1\u2014under both weighting protocol s, we find larger racial disparities in stops than were observed in Table 5.6 for all stops. Again, controlling for demographic backgroundsomewhat reduces the degree of racial disparity in stops, and gender, car age and driver ageinfluence the likelihood of a stop by a local police officer. Driving behaviors are not particularly important determinants of stops by local police. The one exception is that drivers who use theinterstate less often are also stopped less frequently by local police. This seems to be particularlythe case for African American drivers. 202Table 5.7.

Still, there are some exceptions. Controlling for driving behavior, local policestop African American males, but not white male s, at higher rates. The finding from Table 5.5 \u2014that miles driven increases white stops but not African American stops\u2014 is repeated here. Itwould seem that local police do tend to react to the race of drivers and that African American203male drivers are at particular risk of being stopped. White drivers increase their risk of a stop when they drive more, but African American drivers' risk of a stop by local police is increased bytheir race and being male. For both the African American and white populations, being older and driving a newer car reduces the probability of a stop by the local police. Table 5.8 reports ouranalyses of stops by the NCSHP. While there is significant racial disparity in stops by theNCSHP it is less than half as large as the dispar ity produced by local police stops. In fact, after controlling for demographic variables the DMV-we ighted racial gap is not even statistically significant. The record check weighted racial gap in Model 2 is just barely significant andsuggests that African American drivers have 1.38 times the white odds of being stopped. After introducing self-reported driving behavior in Model 3 the racial gap in NCSHP stops increases for both weighting schemes. These analyses suggest that there is some unexplained racial disparity and so there may be some racial bias in driver stops by the NCSHP, but the disparity issubstantially smaller than the potential racial bias present in local police stops.204Table 5.8. Logistic Regression of NCSHP Stop Last Year Upon Race, Demographic Background, and Driving Behavior; multip licative odds coefficient and significance level reported.

Agecontinues to be associated with the likelihood of a stop but the coefficient is closer to one than inprevious models. So, while the NCSHP, like local police forces, seems more likely to give older205drivers a break they do not do so as dramatically as local police do. Also consistent with a more professional orientation, stops by the NCSHP are very strongly related to all measures of driving behavior. People who report more miles driven, dr iving faster, risky driving behavior, and trying to avoid speeding tickets are all stopped at higher rates by the NCSHP. When the models are split by race there are some suggestions that NCSHP troopers are not completely color blind. Being older tends to protect white drivers but not African American drivers from NCSHP stops. Similarly, owning a newer car seems to protect white drivers from stops but not African American drivers. On the other hand, risky driving behaviors such as passing, changing lanes without signaling, and driving without a seatbelt tend to encourageNCSHP stops of African American drivers but not of white drivers. These findings suggest that bias processes, to the extent they exist among NCSHP troopers, are subtle. White drivers are\"protected\" by their age and class, but African American drivers are not. Conversely, African American drivers are penalized for risky drivi ng behaviors but white drivers are not. Another way to say this is that, when the NCSHP troopers react to the race of the driver, it tends to be inconjunction with other status or driving behavior characteristics. These interactions suggests a bias process, in which attributions about characteristics other than race are modified by the raceof the driver. As in the previous analysis miles driven is a risk factor for white drivers but not for African American drivers. White drivers who use the interstate less often than other white driversare stopped more often by the NCSHP. White drivers who use fewer methods to avoid beingstopped are stopped less often.206Discussion of Multivariate Results These logistic regressions of stop experiences upon race, demographic background characteristics and driving behavior provide evidence that there may be some racial disparity inpolice stops of North Carolina drivers. For all stops, as well as for stops by local police and theNCSHP, African Americans are more likely than whites to be stopped in North Carolina. Thedegree of racial disparity, and so potential bias, in police stops appears to be substantially greateramong local police than that within the NCSHP. Within the NCSHP the pattern of stop decisions associated with race suggests that while everyone is stopped for speeding, risky driving behavior can be an aggravating factor for African American s, while class advantage\u2014in the form of a new car or age\u2014is a status shield for whites but not for African Americans. Racial Differences in Stop Experiences We also asked all drivers who reported a stop what reason they were given by the officer for the stop. We coded the reasons into \"speeding,\" \"other moving violations,\" not recall,\" and \"other.\" Speeding probably represents the least discretionary reason, since an officer mustdocument the speed of the driver. \"Other moving violations\" (for example, rolling through a stopsign) and \"non-moving violations\" (for example, a broken taillight) represent clear violations of the driving laws but also enhanced police discretion in making a stop decision. \"Generalsuspicion\" includes various stops to investigat e the license, registration, vehicle, and driver. These could range from running a plate and disc overing that the owner's license had expired, to stopping a car on suspicion of carrying drugs. In all cases they require the officer to proactivelyinvestigate the driver or the car in the absence of a driving violation. 207Table 5.9 displays the racial differences in reasons given for the stop. African Americans are somewhat (3 percent) more likely than whites to be stopped for other moving violations. They are also 4 percent more likely to be stopped for some form of general suspicion. They areless likely to be stopped for speeding. The table also suggests that African Americans are only slightly more likely to be informed by the officer that they were stopped for potentiallydiscretionary reasons (53% versus 51% for other moving, non-moving, and general suspicion, combined). In the recent study by the National Institute of Justice on police-citizen contactsAfrican Americans were 1 percent more likely than whites to be told they were stopped forgeneralized suspicion and 2 percent more likely for non-moving violations. Similar to theprevious comparison of national figures to North Carolina ones, racial disparity in discretionary stops seems to be somewhat higher in North Carolina than in the nation overall. Table 5.9.

We reasoned that, at least for the NCSHP, there is lessdiscretion in speeding stops than in other t ypes of stops. Among NCSHP stops, 61 percent were for speeding. Among local police stops, only 44 percent were for speeding. Although there stillwere significant racial disparities in stops, the racial gap in speeding stops by the NCSHP after208controlling for driver demographics and behavi or was lower (odds of 1.44 with DMV weights) than the racial gap for non-speeding stops (odds of 1.54 with DMV weights). Among local policethe racial coefficients were virtually iden tical for speeding and non-speeding stops. These analyses are consistent with the conclusion that racial disparity may be more widespread amonglocal police than among the NCSHP and that the NCSHP speeding stops display a lower level ofunexplained racial disparity. Table 5.10 reports the outcome of police stops. The top panel of the table focuses on the distribution of citations, written warnings, and verbal warnings. There are no statisticallysignificant racial differences in the distributions of citations, written warnings, and verbalwarnings for all stops, local police stops, or NCSHP stops. Local police are more likely to giveverbal warnings and NCSHP troopers are more likely to issue citations, but neither displaysignificant racial differences in these outcomes. We also asked those who had been stopped if they felt they had been treated with respect by the officer who stopped them. While most people felt they had been treated with respect,African Americans were 5.6 percent less likely to say they were treated with respect than werewhite drivers. The racial gaps in reported respect were nearly identical for local police and forthe NCSHP. These later comparisons were not statistically significant, because of the smallsample size of stops within each category of police. The general pattern is clear, however. Most drivers report respectful treatment, but African Americans are slightly more likely to report a lackof respect in the officer's treatment of them after a stop.209Table 5.10.

Even aftercontrolling for other demographic statuses and dr iving behavior the odds of a stop by local police may be twice as high for African American as they are for white drivers. Local police are alsosignificantly more likely to stop African American males relative to African American females,while among whites there is no gender disparity in stops after controlling for driving behavior. The estimated racial disparity in stops by the NCSHP is much smaller, but still statistically significant after controls for driver characteris tics and reported driving behavior. The NCSHP does not stop African American males at higher rates than African American females net of driving behavior. Among the NCSHP, race is li nked to other attributes in the stop decision. Older whites and whites driving late-model cars are less likely to be stopped than are otherwhites. African Americans who report more risky driving behaviors are more likely to be210stopped. This suggests that the NCSHP troopers are reacting not simply to the race of the driver, but to the combination of race and other status attributes for whites and race and driving behavior for African Americans. After the stop, differences in white and African American experience are less dramatic. African Americans are slightly more likely to have been informed that the stop was for a morediscretionary reason. African Americans are also slightly more likely to report that they weretreated disrespectfully after the stop. There ar e no racial differences in the distribution of citations, written warnings, and verbal warnings. Although there are some racial differences in experiences after the stop, they are small. 211References for Chapter Five Bradburn, Norman. 1983. \"Response Effects.\" Pages 289-319 in Peter Rossi, James Wright, and Andy Anderson (eds.) Handbook of Survey Research . New York: Academic Press.212Chapter 6 Racial Differences in Trust in the Police This chapter examines the processes that produce racial differences in trust in the police. There are substantial racial differences in trust in the police in general and of both local officersand the NCSHP more specifically. Race differences in trust in the police result not only fromracial differences in stop experiences, but also from the reported stop experiences of friends and family. Disrespectful interactions between police and citizens can become affronts against thelocal community. In addition, African Americans are more likely to believe that the police targetminorities and are less trustful of government in general. These cultural perceptions, whichreflect both historical and personal knowledge of racial bias, are powerful sources of minority distrust in the police. To rebuild legitimacy in the minority community police forces would neednot only to control racial bias in policing, but also to change the cultural distrust that arises from past experiences and group history. Introduction While racial disparity in police stops is clearly a problem in its own right, both the experience and perception of police bias may contri bute to minority distrust of law enforcement. Police forces with no or little racial bias in their ranks might still be perceived as untrustworthyby minority citizens. Even majority citizens who believe that police discretion is sometimeslinked to status characteristics, rather than to driving behavior, may have reduced trust in thepolice. The \"driving while black\" phenomenon has a powerful perceptual dimension, which canbe expected to threaten police legitimacy independently of actual officer behavior. In this chapter213we examine citizens' level of trust in the police. As in the previous chapter, we focus on the police overall, local police, and the NCSHP (relatedly, Appendix F discusses some of the findingsof our focus groups with citizens about various issues of racial profiling). Surveys have a long history of use in measuring citizens' trust in the police and other government institutions. It is possible to use a survey to establish the degree to which theexperiences of interaction with the police and the more generic belief in racial profiling mightinfluence the legitimacy of the police force in its citizens' eyes. Trust in government institutionsin general, and any specific police force, will be influenced by the history of relationshipsbetween groups and those institutions as well as more direct experiences and current events. Surveys are potentially useful for establishing the degree to which current police-citizenencounters, beliefs or exposure to current controversies such as \"driving while black,\" or moredeep seated dispositions are in play. Background In the focus groups that we conducted with African American drivers, it was clear that African Americans' perceptions of racial bias in policing were influenced not only by their own stop experiences, but also by the stop experiences of family and friends. In addition, the focusgroups revealed that a generic perception of racial bias in policing - a perception we believe was produced by a culture in which many African American citizens expect racial bias by the policebecause they expect racial bias in many or all institutions in the United States. Focus groupparticipants would also point toward accounts of racial profiling in New Jersey or the Rodney King beating as evidence that racism is widespread among police in general. This suggests to usthat trust in the police is a function, not only of personal experiences with the police, but also the43 Warr and Ellison (2000) have recently pointed out that research on fear of crime has also neglected personal network influences on fear. They find that a prime source of fear of crime is fear for the safety of others. 214experiences of family and friends and more general cultural perceptions of bias by the police and the integrity of institutions. Previous research has demonstrated repeatedly that trust in the police is lower among minorities than among white citizens (Decker 1981; Flanagan and Vaughn 1996; Weitzer andTuck 1999). This research, however, has rarely had direct measures of police encounters and hasnever included measures of police encounters in the respondent's network of family and friends. 43 In addition, previous research shows that white and minority citizens believe that racial targetingis widespread, but minorities are more likely to hold this belief (Gallup 1999). No previous study has examined perceptions of other forms of targeting by police. Some previous research hasshown that well publicized controversial police incidents (for example, the Rodney King beating)tend to reduce trust in the police generally, particularly among minorities (Tuch and Weitzer,1997; Lasley 1994). We reason that belief in racial profiling may have a similar effect. A recent study has shown that middle class minorities are more likely to distrust the police than lower classminorities (Weitzer and Tuck 1999). Finally, many studies have shown that minorities havelower levels of trust in government institutions than do white citizens (Feagin and Sikes 1994). We use a general trust scale in the analyses below to control for general cultural influences ontrust in social institutions that may influence specific trust in police officers. In this chapter we first describe racial differences in trust of the police, perceptions of police stop discretion tied to status characteristics, and more general trust in governmentinstitutions. We then model trust in the police as a function of race, stop experiences, the stop215experiences of friends and family, general trust in government institutions, and perceptions of both racial and other types of bias in policing. Race Differences in Trust of the Police The first panel of Table 6.1 reports racial differences in trust in the police. The first question was \"On a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is always fair and 5 is never fair, do you trust thepolice to treat you fairly?\" In general, whites report trust levels that average close to 2\u2014\"sometimes fair.\" African Americans are on average closer to 3\u2014\"neutral.\" These differencesare quite similar for all three items, although both African Americans and whites report slightlymore trust in the NCSHP than in their local police forces. These results look quite similar toresults reported by Weitzer and Tuck (1999). In the analyses that follow we examine theprocesses that generate distrust of the police in general using a Police Distrust Scale made up ofthe three items listed in Table 6.. We also analyze the processes separately for the itemsindicating distrust in the respondent's local police and in the NCSHP. Race Differences in Personal and Network Stop Experiences The second panel of Table 6.1 shows that African Americans report significantly more stops per year of driving experience, more stops in the last year, and being treated with lessrespect during stops in the last year than do whites drivers. We also asked respondents to report stops they had heard about that had been experienced by members of their household and by friends and acquaintances. We do not think that theseresponses represent an accurate count of the stop experiences of friends and family. Rather, we216see these as indicators of the respondent's stock of stories about police behavior in his or her immediate network. We do not know the racial composition of household members or friends and acquaintances, but assume that the networks of white respondents are predominantly whiteand the networks of African American respondents are primarily African American. In the third panel of the table, we see that African American and white citizens report comparable numbers of stops of household members and of friends and acquaintances. Althoughfew people report acts of disrespect by the poli ce, African Americans report significantly higher levels of disrespect in police behavior during stops of both household members and of friends. In general the levels of reported disrespect are lower in these reports of network experience thanthey are in reports of self-experience. Thus, while African Americans hear more stories ofdisrespectful treatment than do whites, these stories are not widespread in either community. These results suggest to us that the damage to police reputation that is produced by possible racial disparity in stop behavior is not necessarily limited to the person who is stopped,but to some extent becomes part of the community context in which citizens live. The results alsosuggest that the damage done by possible racial disparity in stops is likely to be magnified in theretelling by friends and family. Since the reported levels of disrespect in the experiences offriends and family are lower for African Americans than in their own reported stops, it may be thecase that the consequences of racial disparity in police stops are somewhat attenuated in theretelling. On the other hand, individuals who have never been treated with disrespect by thepolice may hear stories about disrespectful behavior, which are then interpreted as evidence ofracial bias in policing.217Distrust of Government and Belief in Profiling The items that are used in the general trust in government scale are, again, coded from 1\u2014 \"always fair,\" to 5\u2014\"never fair.\" For all of the items, except distrust of county commissioners,African Americans have significantly higher mean scores than whites, signifying higher levels of distrust in these institutions. Distrust of county commissioners is particularly high among allcitizens, regardless of race. In general, distrust of the police is not markedly higher in the African American community than is distrust of othe r government officials. Among whites, however, distrust in the police is quite a bit lower than distrust of other government officials.We also asked these citizens about their perceptions that the police profile drivers. We asked:Since many drivers speed or otherwise break the traffic laws, it is sometimes hard to tell why anyone person gets pulled over by the police. Do you think that the following kinds of drivers aremore likely to be pulled over by police than other drivers: young drivers? men? AfricanAmericans? Latinos? people driving run- down cars? people driving flashy cars? Perceptions of racial disparity are wide spread among African Americans. Eighty-one percent of African Americans believe that the police are more likely to pull over AfricanAmerican drivers. Just under 70 percent of Af rican Americans perceive similar bias against Latino drivers. In contrast, less than a third of white drivers believe that there is racial biasagainst African Americans. Slightly more whites perceive bias against Latinos by the police. Looking at the racial bias scale (which sums th e previous two items and divides by two), we see that whites are 40 percent less likely than African Americans to perceive racial bias in police stopdecisions. The last panel of Table 6.1 reports racial di fferences in other possible types of police profiling. In all cases, African Americans are more likely than whites to suspect bias in police44 In Chapter 5, we saw no gender differences in stops by the NCSHP after controlling for driving behavior. This was also the case among whites stopped by the local police. Among AfricanAmerican stops by the local police, males were at significantly higher risk than females, evenafter controlling for driving behavior. The hi gher perception of male profiling among African Americans than whites may be produced by this pattern of local police stops. It, of course, couldalso be produced by the general perception in the African American community that AfricanAmerican men are particularly vulnera ble in contemporary American society. 218stops, although belief in the profiling of run down car s is not significantly different by race. The racial gap in beliefs in other forms of police bias averages 20 percent across the scale items, halfas large as the racial gap in beliefs in racial bias in policing. One of the most interesting contrastsin the table is that a higher proportion (13.2 percent) of white respondents believe that the policetarget for non-racial reasons than believe that police are racially biased. Among AfricanAmericans the pattern is reversed, racial profiling is perceived as more extensive than other formsof profiling by 8.4 percent. The racial gap of the belief that police profile men is almost as large as the racial gap in the belief in racial profiling. 44 The racial comparisons in Table 6.1 suggest that African Americans' higher levels of distrust in the police could arise from racial differences in stop experiences and in the stop experiences discussed in their personal networks. It also seems plausible to expect that racialdifferences in perceptions of racial targeting and distrust in government may also contribute to the higher levels of African American distrust of the police. Whites report higher levels of belief innon-racial targeting by the police. It is not clear how this might influence racial differences in trust in police. The differences in white and African American responses to the two profilingscales suggests that splitting the models by race might be particularly revealing.219Modeling Distrust of the Police in a Multivariate Context We model the process that gives rise to distrust in the police in a multivariate statistical context. We use two types of statistical models\u2014ordinary least squares and ordered logisticregression. OLS models are appropriate for conti nuous dependent variables. The general distrust in police scale clearly meets the requirement of a continuous variable as does the general trust ingovernment scale. The analyses of trust in the local police and the NCSHP are five category Table 6.1 Race Differences in Distrust of the Police, Stop Ex perience, Trust in Institutions , and Perceptions of Police Bias African American WhiteSignificant Difference?

We use ordered logistic regression for these two items, as well as for our analyses of racial and general profiling beliefs. In both types of models a positive coefficient indicates thatincreases in the explanatory variable (such as a belief in racial profiling) leads to an increase indistrust of the police. A negative coefficient indi cates that an increase in the explanatory variable45 The non-response weights used in the last chapter are not appropriate for these analyses. They are appropriate only for weighting reports of stops. 220leads to increased trust in the police (for example, age). For all explanatory variables mean values are imputed for missing values. We include indicator variables for mean substitution inregression equations but do not report their values in the tables. These models are weighted tocorrespond to the 2000 N.C. Department of Motor Vehicles age-gender distributions withinrace. 45 The logic of the analyses is to first establish the size of the racial gap in trust of the police, net of the set of driver demographic and behavior variables employed in the previous chapter(racial differences in these variables were discussed in the previous chapter and reported in Table4 of that chapter). The demographic variables (gender, education, home ownership, car age,individual age, and rural residence) allow us to statistically adjust racial differences in trust of thepolice for class, gender, and regional influences on distrust in the police that may be correlatedwith race. They also are indicators in their own right of other aspects of a citizen's identity that may influence distrust of the police. Driving behaviors (speeding, miles driven, risky driving, methods to avoid tickets, and interstate frequency) are included in these initial models to adjustfor risk behaviors that may influence trust in the police. We reason that people who break thedriving laws may be less trustful of police because they fear police stops. The second model in the following analyses introduces the respondent's reports of his or her and his or her friends' and family members' stop experiences regarding distrust in the police.We measure the number of stops per driving year and in the most recent year for respondents, butonly stops in the last year for their family and friends. We also include three measures ofdisrespectful treatment during stops corresponding to personal, family, and friends' stops. If221coefficients in Model 1 are reduced in magnitude in Model 2 this indicates that the Model 1 estimates partly reflect and are caused by differences in stop experiences. The third model for our analyses of trust in the police introduces the measure of trust in general government institutions as well as beliefs in racial and non-racial targeting by the police. If coefficients in Model 2 are reduced in magnitude in Model 3, this indicates that the Model 2estimates partly reflect and are caused by differences in general trust and beliefs in police bias. Finally, Model 3 is estimated separately for African American and white citizens to see if theprocesses that lead to distrust in the police are the same for African American and white citizens. Because general distrust of government institutions and belief in racial and other forms of police profiling are such strong influences on distrust of the police, we also model them asoutcomes of demographic and driving variables. We begin with an analysis of racial differences in trust of government officials other than the police and belief in racial and non-racial profiling. Distrust of Government Officials Other than the Police The variable indicating distrust in government officials is an additive scale based on level of distrust in teachers, county commissioners, judges and congressional representatives. In theanalyses of distrust of the police that follows we introduce this variable to account for differencesin generic trust in government that might also spill over into distrust of the police in particular. We first regress the distrust in government scale upon the characteristics of drivers and stopexperiences to see if these characteristics influence generic distrust in government. Table 6.2 reports the models of generic gove rnment distrust. African Americans have significantly higher distrust of government officials. The racial gap of .25 is slightly higher than the racial gap reported in Table 6.1. In add ition, female and young African American drivers 222distrust government officials at higher rates (Mode l 3). African American and white risky drivers distrust government officials at higher rates. Being personally treated with disrespect by police officers during a stop in the past year strongly increases generic distrust of government officials. When the models are split by race, we find that both African Americans' and whites' tr ust in government is undermined by disrespectful treatment by the police during a stop. In addition, African Americans who hear of disrespectful police behavior toward friends and acquaintances trust government officials less. In general, the table suggests that there are relatively large racial gaps in trust of government institutions that are not a function of other driver statuses or of driving behavior. Rather, distrust of government in general is increased when police officers interact with citizensin ways that are interpreted as disrespectful. Hearing stories of disrespectful police behavior from friends and acquaintances increases distrust of government for African Americans. Belief in Racial Profiling The variable indicating belief in racial profiling is an additive scale based on belief in racial profiling of African American and Latino drivers. Models are estimated using ordinal logistic regression because this variable only has three categories. The first model of Table 6.3 223Table 6.2 Regression of Trust in Government Scale on Race, Dr iver Characteristics, and Stop Experiences, N=2,284 Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Race (1=African American).249*** .221***African (low score=highusage)-.005 -.005 .008 -.017 of Stops per Driver Year .021 .040 .018 Number of Stops in Last Year .015 .007 .026Treated with Disrespect During Stop LastYear .455*** .482*** .427** Number of Family Stops in Last Year .014 .028 .005 Family Members Treated with Disrespect .142 .155 .096Number of Friend Stops in Last Year .006 -.012 .019Friends Treated with Disrespect .176 .268* -.003 .090 .051 * .05; **.01; ***.001 regresses belief in racial profiling by the police upon the respondent's race and other driver characteristics. African Americans are much more likely than whites to believe that the policeprofile on the basis of race even after controls for other status characteristics and drivingbehaviors. The much higher African American belief in racial profiling is only minimally a function of class, gender, rurality, or reporte d driving behavior differences between African Americans and whites. Higher education is associated with higher belief that the police profile on the basis of race among both African American and white citizens, although the effect is much stronger224among African Americans. Urban residents of bot h races are significantly more likely than rural residents to believe in racial profiling. Whites who report typically speeding more than five milesan hour above the speed limit are more likely to believe in racial profiling than more law abidingwhite drivers. African Americans who actively try to avoid tickets more are less likely than otherAfrican Americans to believe in racial profiling by the police. Introducing the measures of stop experiences provides some interesting results. Both African American and white drivers who were tr eated with disrespect during a police stop are more likely to believe the police profile on the basis of race. In addition, African Americanswhose family members experience more stops and whose friends report being treated withdisrespect are more likely than other African Americans to believe that the police profile on thebasis of race. Thus for African Americans, but not whites, belief that the police profile on the basis of race is related to the recent experiences of members of their community with the police. An inspection of the R 2 across models makes clear that race is by far the strongest predictor of belief in racial profiling. Belief in Other Forms of Profiling The variable indicating belief in other forms of profiling is an additive scale based on belief in police profiling of young and male drivers as well as profiling of run-down vehicles and flashy cars. We use ordinal logistic regression to estimate the models presented in Table 6.4because belief in other forms of profiling is a five category ordinal scale. Controlling for 225Table 6.3 Ordinal Logistic Regression of Belief in Racial Profiling on Race, Driver Characteristics, and Stop Experiences (N=2,830) Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Race (1=African American) 1.83*** 1.789***African American White .006 .097Risky Driving Scale .065 .006 .078 Methods to Avoid Ticket Scale -.171 -.184 -.447** .007Interstate Frequency (low score=highusage).004 -.005 .004 Stops per Driver Year .097 .151 .084 Number of Stops in Last Year -.039 .002Treated with Disrespect During Stop LastYear .744** .850* .722*Number of Family Stops in Last Year .160* .129 .151 Family Members Treated with Disrespect .457 .588 .297 Number of Friend Stops in Last Year .024 .052 .063 Friends Treated with Disrespect .791** 1.04** .320 2.241 .257 .096 .064 * .05; **.01; ***.001 demographic and driving characteristics, African Americans are more likely to believe in these non-racial forms of profiling as well. African American women are less likely than AfricanAmerican men to believe that the police profile on these other driver characteristics. AfricanAmerican homeowners are less likely to believe in these forms of profiling, while older AfricanAmericans are more likely to think that profiling is about characteristics other than race. Whiteswho report typically speeding while driving are more likely to report that police profile on non-racial dimensions. 226The only statistically significant stop experience reported in the model for whites indicates that respondents whose family members were stopped more in the last year are more likely thanother whites to believe that the police profile on these non-racial characteristics. This latterfinding is particularly interesting in light of the previous analysis. African Americans' belief in Table 6.4.

While not as dramatic, white belief in other forms of profiling is enhanced by family stop experiences.227General Distrust of the Police Table 6.5 reports the multivariate analysis of the general distrust in police scale. This scale was created by summing the three police trust items described in Table 6.1 and dividing by threeto preserve the original metric. We estimate the models using ordinary least squares regression asthe untransformed scale varies from 3 to 15. Model 1 shows that African Americans are .63 unitsmore distrustful of police than are whites, even after controlling for other demographic statusesand driving behaviors. This result is very similar to the bivariate relationship reported in Table6.1, and it indicates that African Americans are significantly more likely to distrust the policethan are whites. This result holds up across all three models, although the total racial differencesin distrust declines in Models 2 and 3. On balance, this suggests that the racial gap in trust in thepolice is partly created by police encounters with the respondent and his or her family and friends,and partly by the more generalized beliefs in police profiling and distrust of governmentexamined in the previous two tables. There are three additional statistically significant effects in Model 1. Older drivers show lower distrust of the police. It is also the case that faster drivers and those reporting more risky behaviors are more distrustful of the police. As we expected, drivers who break the law routinely are less trustful of police than their more law abiding counterparts, suggesting perhaps anunderstanding of their increased vulnerability. For speeding, this effect is limited to whites. Model 2 introduces the indicators of personal and network stop experiences. The racial gap in stops declines slightly relative to Model 1, suggesting that personal and network stopexperiences produce about 8 percent (.58/.63) of th e heightened minority distrust of the police. Stop experiences also reduce to non-significance the effects of speeding behavior on police distrust. Speeding increases the probability of a stop, which in turn influences distrust in the228police. In the split models, however, whites who speed remain particularly suspicious of the police. The more lifetime stops per year of driving, the less the trust in the police, but this effect is particularly present among white drivers. Stops in the past year, either of the respondent or of hisor her family and friends, have no effect on trust in the police\u2014with one exception. Surprisingly,whites who have been personally stopped in the last year show increased trust in the police. Being treated with disrespect by an officer duri ng a stop in the last year, however, dramatically increases distrust of the police for both African Americans and whites. Similarly, and onlysomewhat less dramatically, disrespectful treatment during stops to family or friends increases the level of distrust in the police. One way to interpret these results is that it takes multiple stops over a lifetime to damage the legitimacy of the police, but it takes only a single act of disrespect during a citizen encounterto lower citizen trust. Acts of disrespect are likely to be shared with family and friends and alsoto lower trust in the police across the whole ac quaintance network of the motorist who has been treated poorly. Model 3 introduces the measures of trust in other government institutions and the two measures of perceptions of police targeting of drivers. The racial gap in trust is still statisticallysignificant but drops to .35 in this model. Thirty-nine percent of the observed racial gap in trustin the police is directly tied to these three measures. Perceptions of racial and non-racial targetingby the police, as well as historically produced distrust of government institutions are powerfulsources of distrust of the police. The effect of general distrust of government officials is three times larger than the effects of belief in either profiling scale. Ending racial disparity in stops,229even ending perceptions of racial bias, can only be a first step in building community trust in the police. The risky driving scale is no longer significant. As we saw in Table 6.2, risky drivers are less trustful of government in general. The effect s of the three indicators of police disrespect are all reduced in Model 3. Again, as we saw in Tables 6.2 and 6.3, disrespectful treatment by thepolice increases distrust of government in general and the belief that police are targeting minoritydrivers. Models 4 and 5 split the sample by race and estimate Model 3 again. The processes which generated distrust in the police are not dramatica lly different by race. As noted previously, even after controlling for general trust in government, whites who routinely speed are less trustful ofthe police. African American drivers who are more active in scanning the road for speed traps areless trusting in the police than other African Americans. Disrespectful treatment of drivers, or their friends and family, increases distrust of the police among both African Americans and whites. Belief systems influence distrust in the policesimilarly for African American and white citizen s. Among African Americans distrust of the police is strongly influenced by their general dist rust of government officials and belief in racial profiling, but not by their belief in non-racial poli ce profiling. Whites' distrust of the police, on the other hand, is also influenced by belief in non-racial profiling. 230 Table 6.5.

The results in Model 1 are nearlyidentical to those in the previous table. African Americans, the young, risky drivers, and self-231reported speeders are all more distrustful of the police as in the previous table. Adding stop experiences in Model 2 also produces nearly identical results to those in the previous table. Morelifetime stops increase distrust of the local police, as do disrespectful interactions with the police, either with the respondent or with his or her family and friends. Again the effect of speedingbehavior on distrust is mediated by stop experiences. Model 3 introduces the measure of generaldistrust and the two measures of belief in police profiling. Again these are powerful predictors ofdistrust in the local police. They also mediate a large share of the racial coefficient, suggestingthat these more general cultural perceptions which are strongly linked to race are powerfulsources of minority distrust in their local police. Again, being a risky driver is no longer asignificant predictor, suggesting that they tend to distrust government in general (refer back toTable 6.2). Models 4 and 5 compare the processes generating distrust of the local police for African American and white drivers. The coefficients fo r demographic and driving behavior variables are quite similar with one exception. Risky white drivers are particularly distrustful of the police,even net of controls for general distrust of government. More dramatically, stop experiencesproduce much larger coefficients for whites than for African Americans. While both AfricanAmerican and white drivers' trust in their local police is diminished by disrespectful treatment,this is much more so the case for white drivers. Similarly, lifetime stops per year reduces white,but not African American, trust in the police si gnificantly and dramatically. Finally, both African American and white distrust of local police is tied to their distrust of government in general, butbelief in racial profiling is a more important s ource of distrust among African American drivers, while belief in other forms of profiling by the police undermines white trust.232Table 6.6 Ordinal Logistic Regression of Distrust of Local Police on Race, Driver C haracteristics, Stop Experiences, Trust in Institutions, and Perceptions of Police Bias (N=2,830) Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Race (1=African American) 1.11*** 1.036** .732***African .073 .058 .024 .077Miles Driven Last Year .035Risky Driving Scale .152*** .143*** -.031 -.226 .149Interstate Frequency (low score=high usage) .015 .015 .021 .011 .030 Number of Stops per Driver per Year .329*** .361*** .207 .528*** Number of Stops in Last Year -.041 -.060 .007 -.270**Treated with Disrespect During Stop Last Year 1.221*** .819*** .659** 1.095*** Number of Family Stops in Last Year -.016 -.031 -.060 .018 Family Members Treated with Disrespect 1.006*** 1.099*** 1.002** 1.288*** Number of Friend Stops in Last -.018 Friends Treated with Disrespect Generalized Distrust of Government in Racial Profiling Scale .373*** .413* .302*Belief in Other Forms of Profiling Scale .359* .096 .673** Psuedo R 2.149 .202 .455 .453 .382 * .05; **.01; ***.001 Distrust of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol Table 6.7 repeats the previous analyses, but now trust refers specifically to distrust of the NCSHP. Models 1 through 3 reprise the results we have already encountered in the generaldistrust and local police analyses. Distrust of the NCSHP seems to be governed by the same233generic process that leads to distrust in the police in general. The one interesting new finding is that African Americans who drive more miles per year tend to have increased trust in the NCSHP. Models 4 and 5 reveal some interesting differences in the process that generates distrust in theNCSHP between African Americans and white driver s. African American trust in the NCSHP is not influenced by lifetime stops or personally being treated with disrespect during a recent stop. Both of these experiences increase white distrust of the NCSHP. Similarly, belief in racial andnon-racial profiling increase white distrust of th e NCSHP but not African Americans' distrust. These racial differences in the processes that gene rate distrust of the NCSHP suggest that African American's trust in the NCSHP is less vulnerable to either personal experience or the currentcontroversy around police profiling. This is certainly consistent with the findings in the lastchapter that racial disparity in stops by the NCSHP is much lower, and a much more subtleprocess, than racial disparity in local police stops. These findings are also consistent with ourfocus groups with white and African American driv ers. In those focus groups white drivers did not clearly differentiate between different types of police. African American drivers, on the other hand, were quite clear that they had considerably more trust in NCSHP troopers to actprofessionally than they did of their local police. Conclusions Distrust in the police is produced by a combination of negative personal experiences with the police, negative experiences of family and friends, belief in police profiling on both racial andnon-racial grounds, general distrust of government institutions, and being a minority. 234Table 6.7 Ordinal Logistic Regression of Distrust of the NCSHP on Race, Driver Char acteristics, Stop Experiences, Trust in Institutions, and Perceptions of Police Bias (N=2,830) Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Race (1=African American) 1.117*** 1.071*** .764***African American Home Owner .025 to Avoid .076 Interstate -.003 .002 .005 -.009 Treated with Disrespect During Stop Last Year .977*** .551** .200 1.221*** Number of Family Stops in Last Year .066 .012 .031 -.012 Family Members Treated with Disrespect 1.013*** .915*** .803* 1.162** Friends Treated with Distrust of Government 1.568*** Belief in Racial Profiling Scale .307** .225 .357** Belief in Other Forms of Profiling Scale .456** .180 .698** Psuedo R 2.152 .187 .421 .404 .346 * .05; **.01; ***.001235The related problems of racial profiling and trust in the police are not simple ones. African Americans distrust the police, especially local police, because of their personal experiences andmore general cultural orientations. Disrespectful interactions are particularly powerful sources ofboth distrust in the police and belief in racial pr ofiling. This is not, however, simply a perception produced by direct experience. On the contrary, negative encounters with the police by familyand friends generate distrust and increase the belief in racial profiling. In fact, among African Americans, disrespectful police treatment or st ories of disrespectful police treatment can even undermine trust in government institutions in general. Belief in racial profiling undermines trustin the police even among whites. African Americans are more forgiving of the NCSHP than are whites. African Americans are more likely to translate negative experiences into distrust of local police forces than theNCSHP. This may reflect their observations of lower bias or more professional carriage by NCSHP troopers. Whites, on the other hand, are less discriminating. Any perception of disrespector profiling undermines white trust in all types of police. Whites are particularly influenced byperceptions of non-racial profiling, assumedly becau se these are the types of profiling for which they would be most at risk. Thus while African Americans are more distrustful of the police ingeneral than are white citizens, white's trust in the police seems more vulnerable to recentexperiences and media portrayals. Citizen trust in police is also influenced by more general dispositions toward trust in government. This is true for white and African American citizens and for all types of policeexamined. This suggests that the legitimacy of the police in general, and of specific police forces,236is a nested problem. Police legitimacy is undermined by disrespectful treatment (especially among whites), and belief in racial profiling (esp ecially among African Americans), and belief in other forms of profiling (especially among whites). Where racial disparity in treatment is lower,as in the NCSHP versus local police, African Americans do not translate negative experience intoreduced trust. Police legitimacy is more vulnerable among whites. African Americans, however,have a lower level of trust in the police of all types stemming from their past experiences in, andcultural understanding of, American society. Some of this can be seen in African Americans'lower trust in government institutions in general, but most seems to be focused on a specific fearof the police. Among whites distrust of the police is more strongly tied to distrust of governmentinstitutions in general.237References for Chapter Six Feagin, Joe. 1991.\"The Continuing Significance of Race: Antiblack Discrimination in Public Places.\" American Sociological Review . 56:101-16.

As we began collecting and analyzing the data, we realized that these general goals could be broken down into several sub-goals: 1) to determine ifthere were disparities in the stops and citations of African Americans after controlling statisticallyfor the deployment of troopers (by place and time); 2) to determine if the troopers specializing inconducting searches for contraband (the CIT ) stopped and conducted searches based on the raceof the person stopped; 3) to develop methods to provide for information as to districts and troopers with racially disparate intervention rates (to be used in conjunction with other indicatorsof bias, such as citizen and/or trooper complaints); 4) to determine the extent to which surveys ofthe general public regarding traffic violations and stops can help shed light on the processesinvolved; 5) to assess the attitudes of the general public in their perception of racial bias andprofiling and to see if the authority of the NCSHP was being undermined by the perceptions of widespread racial disparity in stops, citations a nd searches; and 6) to assess the points of view of the NCSHP troopers themselves as they discussed possible racial bias and profiling. We willdiscuss each of these goals in turn. Official Record Evidence of Disparity In assessing the prevalence of racial disparity, it is necessary to differentiate between the usual statistical information available to state police organizations (essentially statewide totals of239the number and percentage of interventions invol ving African Americans) and information based on, and required for, a more detailed analysis involving appropriate statistical control variablesthat account for the deployment of troopers relative to the racial demographic characteristics ofthe drivers on the highway. Data on stops, citations, and written warnings that allow for a simplestatistical summary for the state as a whole s how evidence of racial disparity against African Americans. For example, even though African Americans make up approximately 20 percent ofthe drivers in the state, they constitute almost 25 percent of the drivers cited for speeding. Ingeneral, we find overall levels of disparity of the magnitude of 5 to 10 percent in absolute terms,and up to 50 percent in relative terms (for example, a 20 percent African American driverbaseline and a 30 percent rate of stops/citations of African Americans for license, registration, orinsurance violations represent a 10 percent absolute difference or a 50 percent relativedifference\u201410% absolute difference/20% African Am erican baseline. It should be noted that we do not find evidence of larger disparity, such as that suggested by Lamberth (2001), nor do we find that the disparity increases when we control for the measures of the deployment of troopers. Throughout the analysis of the official record data, we are limited by the fact that we have baselines that only approximate the actual volume of drivers on the highways (so called \"proxymeasures\") -- and those drivers are assumed to be \"available\" for a stop -- against which tomeasure the racial composition of the drivers stopped and cited by the NCSHP. That is, we donot have direct measures of the racial com position of highway drivers, and thus cannot make strong claims as to whether or not the racial dispar ity that we observe is due to racial bias or to deployment. (By deployment we are referring to the assignment of patrol cars to areas of highways by time of day). For example, all else being equal, the more patrolling of areas withmore African American drivers, the greater the disparity in the racial composition of those240stopped, cited or warned. Deployment by time of day is also relevant since we find strong evidence that the proportion of drivers who are African American varies by time of day (with proportionately more African Americans on the highway at night). Analyses of racial profiling are further complicated by researchers' inability to directly and precisely measure what troopers actually observe and react to as they patrol the highways. That is, while driver/vehicle behavior would likely be a crucial piece of information to use inaccounting for the observed levels of disparity, su ch information on the actual racial distributions across different infractions are generally unknown. We were able to obtain a first measure ofdriver behavior but it was limited to fourteen highway segments (as discussed in Appendix A). For those limited geographic areas we found that there were differences in the vehicular speedingbehavior of whites and African Americans, with more speeding above what we call \"localspeeding thresholds\" on the part of African Amer icans. We do not generalize our findings from the fourteen sites to other areas, because we cannot rule out the likelihood that there are racialdifferences in driving behavior across locales and conditions. Our opinion, as informed by whatlittle evidence is available on this topic, is that there are many factors involved in thedetermination of the racial composition of driver s involved in traffic violations in an area. Further data on such behavior are necessary for researchers to be able to make truth claims in thisregard. Besides not having direct measures of viola ting behavior, we as researchers do not have direct measures of the deployment of troopers. Instead, we can only assemble a \"paper trail\" ofstops, citations, and written warnings issued by troopers. Thus, we do not know how many hours of patrolling occur on a given highway, nor at what precise times. In controlling statistically for deployment we can only compare citation rates of African Americans to our best available241baseline measure at the smallest unit of analysis feasible to study. Here we argue that the data on accidents provide a baseline measure at relatively small units of analysis (as small as what we callthe \"county highway area\" or the stretch of a highw ay within about a quarter of a North Carolina county). We argue that accident data at the leve l of the county highway area allow us to take a look into the problem of the mismatch of wh ere NCSHP troopers look for violators and where violations occur (the so-called \"spatial heterogeneity\" problem). Yet, our measures will involvean imprecise match not only because the racial composition of drivers in accidents is notnecessarily an adequate substitute for the behavior of drivers violating the traffic laws, butbecause there still could be a substantial mismatch between where the patrols occur and where thecitizens violate the traffic laws. For example, there could be variation within a given highway segment (such as what we call a county highway area) in the proportion of violating drivers who are African American because of the intersecting highways which take drivers from, and supplydrivers to, specific segments of the highway. Thus, we may find that on a highway within acounty, such as U.S. 64 in Nash County, that 25 percent of the drivers violating the law areAfrican American in one segment, and 20 percent in another because the intervening intersectiontakes/provides African Americans to/from a town where relatively many African Americans live. The limited data we have on such variation within highways indicates that 5 percent changes inthe African American composition are common. An examination of the stops of drivers by the NCSHP on highways where there are mileposts indicates even more variation in the patrolling patterns of the NCSHP by mile ofhighway. Adjacent miles of a given highway can differ by a substantial degree in the number ofstops that occur, and such variation cannot reasona bly be attributed only to variation in driving behavior. The NCSHP may stop drivers more in one segment of a highway than another due to a242variety of very local considerations, such as turn-around points to the opposite direction, wide shoulders to pull over vehicles safely, low dens ity of traffic (stopping vehicles in high density traffic may cause accidents), and so forth. If the choice of such high volume stop zones happens to coincide with the disproportionate presence of African American drivers, the disparity rate for an area may rise accordingly. With all of these considerations possibly at work\u2014and not measured in the data available to us\u2014one can neither rule out the possibility that racial bias explains some of the variation inracial disparity, nor assert that it is unequivocally present in any geographic area or in theworkings of any specific trooper. Put simply, the current level of science is inadequate to thedetermination of whether disparity can be explai ned by bias or by one or the other of the rival hypotheses just discussed. At the same time the empirical evidence from the analysis of accident and citation data at the district level (in which data have been aggr egated from the county highway area) suggests that there are some districts where there are relativel y high levels of racial disparity that cannot be accounted for by the deployment of troopers (within the limits of the analysis as discussed above). Yet, it must be mentioned that there are even more districts where there is under-representation ofAfrican Americans in citations: there are fewer citations of African Americans relative toinvolvement in accidents. It could be that the dist ricts with high rates of disparity in this analysis are units where there is racial bias, or it could be that there are uncontrolled variables that accountfor the disparity. Given the data and analysis limitations discussed above, we cannot say withcertainty. The analysis in Chapter 3 at the individual trooper level also leads us to a conclusion of ambiguity regarding whether or not there are tr oopers who have unduly high rates of citations of243African Americans. While we have developed mathematical models that explain about two- thirds of the variance in the number of African Americans cited, it is not possible to ascertainwhat proportion of the remaining variance can be explained by bias or by factors not included in the model. Criminal Interdiction Team As for the results of our analysis of the searches conducted by the Criminal Interdiction Team (CIT) and by regular NCSHP troopers, we were initially surprised to find that compared tothe very large volume of drivers confronted by the NCSHP every year (upward to a million),there were about a thousand probable cause and consent searches a year in 1997, dropping toabout 500 in 2000. The majority of the probable cause and consent searches are conducted by theCIT. In consent searches, the trooper receives the permission of the suspect prior to searching thevehicle, and in probable cause searches, the trooper has reason to suspect that contraband ishidden in the vehicle and consent is not needed (however, we were told by some CIT troopers thatsometimes consent was asked for in what were clear probable cause situations). Looking attrends over time, we see that probable cause searches increased as a proportion of all probablecause and consent searches. The proportion of all searches involving African Americans declinedover the four years of available data, 1997-2000. At the same time the \"hit\" rates (findingcontraband) have increased for African American s and are down somewhat for whites. If racial disparity in searches is any indication of r acial profiling, it would seem that the NCSHP has lessened\u2014or perhaps even eliminated\u2014such activity over the course of the years we haveexamined. 244At the same time, our discussions with CIT troopers indicate that the primary method used by troopers to initiate searches is the so-called \"conversational method\" in which the trooper asksthe driver routine questions, and depending on the nature of the answers and the degree ofnervousness of the driver, decides to ask the driver for permission to search the vehicle. Thedriver then has the option to either decline or accept the offer (we are told that most accept, evenif they have contraband in their vehicle). As such, the method seems to us to open the door to arather subjective process of decision making. When does someone appear to be \"excessivelynervous?\" What constitutes an \"inconsistent story\" as to where one is going? In that the processis a subjective one, the door is left open for \"cognitive bias\" to influence the decision making ofthe trooper, possibly resulting in a disproportionate number of African American searches. Indicators of Racial Disparity One of the by-products of our efforts is to provide a road-map for some techniques of data analysis that others may draw upon in making a d ecision whether or not a particular troop or even a particular trooper is racially biased. In Chapter 2, we show how a troop district could be identified as having a relatively high rate of citations of African Americans relative to any ofseveral base rates (licensed drivers, \"drivers driving,\" or drivers in accidents). By statisticallycontrolling for variations in deployment (by time of day and location), and by collecting sufficient data at relatively small units of analysis (to limit the effects of spatial heterogeneity or themismatch between where troopers patrol and where drivers drive), it is possible to obtain anestimate of the extent to which a district departs fr om an expected value. As such, districts which are found to depart excessively from other districts despite the statistical controls are candidatesfor further scrutiny.245It should be pointed out that our assumption is that an overt kind of racial bias is likely to manifest itself in multiple ways, and hopefully decision makers would have multiple indicators ofsuch bias available to them. For example, there is likely to be a trail of citizen complaints abouttroopers who behave in racially derogatory ways toward citizens. Other troopers are likely to beaware of the expression of inappropriate racial attitudes on the part of a given trooper or even a troop. Records, including personnel files, are alternative sources of information on expressions ofovert racial bias. Racial bias of a more subtle kind, specifically \"cognitive bias,\" is not necessarily associated with citizen complaints, or other indicators of explicit bias. Rather, statistical evidenceof disparity that cannot be accounted for by appropr iate statistical controls is probably the best source of information on the presence of cognitive bias. The kinds of statistical analysispresented in Chapters 2 and 3 provide a means to ascertain where disparity could well be a signof such cognitive bias. At the same time, we admit that the evidence is somewhat ambiguous asto whether a district has an exceptionally high rate of interventions directed at African Americans, or if a specific trooper has. The statistical analyses need be supplemented with furtherinvestigations to rule out possible rival hypotheses as to why the statistical disparity is present. Self-Reported Traffic Violations and Stops In addition to attempting to assess racial disparity in the official data bases of the NCSHP, we also conducted surveys of the general public to see if there was any correspondence betweenthe two different sources of information (surveys and official records), and to determine if we could learn more about the behaviors of interest by studying the surveys. The results are246encouraging to those doing research in the area of racial disparity in that there are some broad similarities between the findings of the survey data with the findings of the official data. Forexample, according to the survey findings, African American drivers are significantly more likely than white drivers to have been stopped by the police in North Carolina. This finding generallycorresponds to the official data findings. However, the survey also found patterns that could notbe found with the limited official data available to us: local police are even more likely to havestopped an African American relative to their representation in the population of drivers andcontrolling statistically for self-reported drivi ng behavior. Other intriguing survey findings include that African Americans are slightly more likely to have been informed that the stop wasfor a more discretionary reason, and they are also slightly more likely to report that they weretreated disrespectfully after the stop. On balance, the use of surveys to study the controversialtopic of racial profiling is promising. Attitudes of the General Public Survey data also are useful in that they tell us about people's opinions as relevant to such important considerations as whether or not trust in the police is undermined by racial profilingperceptions. One fact is undeniably true: in the focus groups that we conducted with AfricanAmerican drivers it was clear that African American s' perceptions of racial bias in policing were influenced not only by their own stop experiences, but also by the stop experiences of family andfriends. Some previous research has shown that well publicized and controversial policeincidents, such as the Rodney King beating, tend to reduce trust in the police generally,particularly among minorities. Not only do media events affect attitudes toward the police, but sodoes the direct experience of citizens in their encounters with police, as well as the experiences of247friends and family. Although few people repor t acts of disrespect by the police, African Americans report significantly higher levels of disr espect in police behavior during stops of both household members and of friends. The perception of racial bias on the part of police is widespread: 81 percent of African Americans believe that the police are more likely to pull over African American drivers. Just lessthan 70 percent of African Americans perceive sim ilar bias against Latino drivers. In contrast, less than one third of the white drivers believe that there is racial bias against African Americans,and whites also see more bias against Latinos than African Americans. Interestingly, more whiterespondents believe that the police target for non-racial reasons than they believe that policeprofile on the basis of ethnicity or race. We find that both African American's and white's trust in government, as well as in the police themselves, are undermined by disrespectful treatment by the police during a stop. Inaddition, African Americans who hear of disres pectful police behavior toward friends and acquaintances are less trustful of government officials\u2014and the police. Viewpoints of the NCSHP Troopers Not surprisingly, the NCSHP troopers with whom we spoke in the focus group sessions say that they do not racially profile, although some admit that there may be \"isolated instances\" ofit within the NCSHP. \"Bad apples\" exist in any large organization, the NCSHP not excepted. Moreover, they say that the nature of the work is one in which they are largely reacting to thebehavior of vehicles, and that it is not easy to see the race of drivers until after the decision hasbeen made to stop the vehicle (and often not until the trooper approaches the vehicle). At thesame time, troopers talked about targeting highways where there are multiple bars (often lower248class bars), and not spending too much time ar ound \"country club\" bars (\"fishing those holes\" were not seen to be especially fruitful). As such, and to the extent that such deployment choicesare common, decisions of this sort do suggest a level of class bias. There was also someacknowledgment of what can be considered to be classic stereotyping, such as regarding Latinodrivers generally being \"bad drivers.\" There was also discussion about enforcement practices thatmight increase or decrease levels of disparity in stop outcomes. While most commonly trooperssuggested they have already made the decision to issue a citation (rather than issue a written orverbal warning) when the car is pulled over, some troopers said that they can sometimes beinfluenced by the resulting interaction with the driver: a display of \"bad attitude\" (inappropriatedemeanor) may earn some drivers a citation rather than a warning. As such, these statementspoint to the discretionary aspects of NCSHP, and all law enforcement, work. One clear message from all of the regular road troopers with whom we have spoken is that they are reluctant to become involved in vehicular searches. (The rarity of such searches bytroopers in part validates this claim.) In the past, when the \"war on drugs\" placed more of anemphasis on drug interdiction, some troopers suggested that some racial profiling may haveoccurred (See Appendix B for a summary of focus groups with the NCSHP). As for what to do about possible racial bi as and profiling, the troopers mentioned record reviews, use of cameras in patrol cars, court visits to assess the quality of evidence and charges,and occasional ride alongs as possible avenues toward keeping check on troopers.249Conclusion On the basis of all of our analysis, we conclude that although there is no conclusive evidence of widespread racial disparity exhibite d in the actions of the NCSHP troopers in their routine interactions and interventions with drivers, there are some districts and some trooperswhose citation rates of African Americans may warrant further investigation and possiblyongoing or intermittent monitoring. However, it is not our recommendation that suchinvestigations necessarily occur. Presumably, the NCSHP would have more direct knowledge ofseveral of the important factors that we have tried to measure that may help to account for theobserved disparity (for example, more precise measures of deployment, especially as it related totime of day and location). Thus, the decision on their part to reexamine practice in 2000 wouldonly be made if there were other information (information not available to us, but available toNCSHP leadership) of potentially biased behavior of any troop or individual trooper active in the force in 2000. Our purpose here is only to sensitize the NCSHP leadership to possibilities ofirregular patterns that might be construed as evidence of bias. Given inadequacies in the data andin the measurement of key concepts, we cannot rule out the presence of low prevalence levels ofbias, perhaps of the \"cognitive bias\" sort. Thus, we think that more evidence would be requiredthan currently found with the data available to us, to proceed with further investigation ofpotentially biased behavior in NCSHP in 2000. At the same time we think that the methodologythat we have developed here can serve NCSHP and other trooper organizations to monitorpossible racial bias in their ongoing operations. Our analysis of the actions of the CIT, which represents only a handful of the troopers in the NCSHP, leads us to conclude that even though there is less disparity than there was a few250years ago, the CIT troopers in the year 2000 are more likely to search a vehicle driven by an African American than by a white. The fact that the CIT is more likely to find contraband in anAfrican American driven vehicle undermines, to some extent, the possible bias interpretation oftheir behavior. Nevertheless, the use of the \"conversational method\" as the primary mechanismfor deciding to conduct so called \"consent searches\" leaves open the door to processes of possiblebias (\"cognitive bias\") in which the \"signs\" that the troopers are looking for are sought moreoften, or are seen to be more compelling, when the driver is African American. Regardless of the interpretation of the empiri cal evidence of possible racial disparity, the perceptions of bias and of inappropriate treat ment on the part of police (including the NCSHP) seems to foster distrust of the police. Aside from eliminating any vestige of possible racialdisparity, the NCSHP would be wise to take actions to ameliorate the perceptions that theirbehaviors are unfair. 251Appendix A: Baseline Observational Study This appendix details the methodology we used to study one particular driving behavior\u2014vehicular speeding\u2014and correlates results from that observational study with officialdata on trooper stops for the NCSHP (during three months of the year 2000 - May, June, andJuly). It is proposed that the data collection technique pioneered by Lamberth, called the\"carousel method\" or \"rolling survey,\" can be improved upon and serve as a methodologicallysound technique for collecting speeding data on demographic groups (Lamberth 2000). An analysis of fourteen highway segments in North Carolina indicates that speeding behavior isstrongly correlated to NCSHP stops of citizens' ve hicles for speeding. Some evidence of possible racial disparity on the part of the NCSHP in the stops for speeding on the highways studied isfound, but in general the results are not statistically significant. In general, NCSHP stopbehavior of speeders seems to be determined by vehicular driving behavior. Central to our concerns herein is the questi on of whether or not different races or ethnic groups have similar behavior rates. If so, then the task of determining whether or not racialdisparity exists in stops, citations, and warnings of African Americans is made considerablyeasier. But upon what basis can we as researchers assume equivalent behaviors acrossdemographic groups? Studying Driver Behavior The issue of whether or not assumptions of equivalency in behavior across demographic groups are warranted has not been adequately addressed in previous research. The omission is252primarily due to a lack of quality data, which in itself reflects several methodological difficulties of collecting data. These methodological difficu lties center around the difficulties associated with identifying the race (or age and gender) of drivers traveling at high speeds on highways. A recentstudy by Lange and associates (2002) used video cameras and radar speed guns to determine raceand speed, respectively. However, of the 38,747 images collected, only 26,334 were usable(12,413 were not; as reported in Kociewiewski 2002). That is, in almost one third of theobservations, the race of the driver could not be determined or agreed upon by three researcherswatching the video. This research, therefore bolst ers our claim that collecting such data on race of driver is difficult. One might think that data collection would be as easy as standing by the side of the road and observing. Armed with a radar gun and a pad of paper, researchers seemingly could recordthe race, as well as perhaps the gender, age, and speed of drivers as they drive by, and then wouldbe able to compare such data with the rates of stops and citations for a given highway. Researchers might even be able to observe vehi cles weaving unsafely, or vehicles with expired license plate \"stickers,\" or perhaps identify drivers they thought were \"driving while intoxicated.\" One could conceivably estimate speed of the vehicles on a video tape by measuring the timeduring which a known distance is traveled. These first thoughts on how to collect data on the behavior of drivers, however, have several problems that make them impractical. One problem is that the glare on windshields andside windows of vehicles makes it difficult to see clearly the motorist's race, as well as his or her gender or age, from a safe distance at the side of the road. The glare is in part due to the tintingdone on most, if not all, windshields and to the angle of light from the sky (even on cloudy days). Video cameras suffer from the same problem. The skeptic is encouraged to simply try to stand46Further analysis of the data collected by Lange and associates, however, may prove our claims wrong. 253(from a safe distance) near a highway with fast-moving traffic, and see how often they can successfully identify the demographic characteristic s of drivers. We experimented with this method and found that we were frequently unable to do so. Compounding this difficulty is thehigh rate of speed of the passing vehicles, as there is little time to assess demographiccharacteristics, much less their speed. More importantly, when we tried this technique (roadsideviewing), it did not seem likely that our failure to identify demographic characteristics wasrandom (else one could argue that misses were \"random error\" and could be safely ignored). Rather, some types of vehicles or conditions, such as an open side window, seem to permitgreater visibility than others. In short, we suspect that it is simply too difficult to reliablyascertain demographic characteristics from the sides of busy roads (also, it is rather unsafe for theobserver, unless he or she is well removed from the highway, but then it is even harder to see intopassing vehicles). 46 Despite these concerns, we should note that the general substantive findings of the Lange et al. study are generally similar to what we report here regarding racial differences in speeding behavior. As an alternative methodology, researchers might collect data on drivers by riding with NCSHP troopers. Researchers could keep track of what troopers encounter and react to on thehighway. One drawback of this approach is that troopers might alter their behavior under suchcircumstances. Our concerns, however, were primar ily with safety. We did not want to place our researchers in patrol cars during an extended period of time due to the risk of accidents (which ismuch higher than for the average passenger car) and of possible encounters with armed citizens(unlikely, but with potentially catastrophic consequences).254Fortunately, there is a viable alternative to avoid the problems discussed above on the task of collecting data on drivers guilty of at least one type of law breaking: vehicular speeding. The \"carousel method\" of identifying speeders and their demographic characteristics is a method inwhich a research vehicle is driven at the speed limit, and vehicles that pass the research vehiclecan be examined from the vantage point of the research vehicle, wherein the researchers canidentify the race and other demographic features of the driver. Other researchers found, and weverified, that at the close range of the proximate traffic lane on a highway, one is almost always successful at identifying race and gender\u2014and even age (see discussion below). There is littlewindshield or car-door window glare at close range. Moreover, in the vast majority of cases, our research teams were in agreement as to the race of the driver in the adjacent lane. By countingthe race of the drivers who pass (as well as whom the research vehicle passes), we can identifythe prevalence of certain demographic groups on the highway, as well as their prevalence amongthe speeding population. As such, the carousel method, as used by Lamberth in Maryland, was abig improvement over previous research studies which were based on the demographiccharacteristics of the area surrounding the highway. With the carousel method, the researcher cankeep track of the racial composition of speeders and have a better denominator than, for example,Census Bureau population counts of local reside nts. The number of African Americans on a particular highway who are speeding could be compared with a numerator based upon, forexample, the number of African Americans stopped for or issued a citation for speeding. Such aratio could then be compared to the corresponding ratio of whites in order to determine theexistence of racial disparity\u2014and, by extension, any evidence of racial discrimination. 255Modified Carousel Method The problem with the carousel method as it has been implemented previously, is that not all speeding is equal. Passing vehicles could be driving 2 mph faster or 20 mph faster than the researchers' vehicle\u2014and they would both be count ed simply as speeders. Almost all vehicles travel above the speed limit on major highways, and it is well known that police do not routinelystop or cite vehicles simply because they are breaking the speed limit. Rather, vehicles must beexceeding a certain \"threshold\" of speed to actually trigger a stop and citation (or perhaps only awarning). The carousel method, as used by Lamber th, did not differentiate speeders based on the extent of their speed. We explored the possibility of capturing the speed of other vehicles on the highway by using two radar guns (called in the business \"same lane\" radar, which means capturing the speedof a vehicle moving in the same direction of the pa trol car or, here, research vehicle). One radar gun captures the speeds of vehicles as they approach from the rear, and the other gun capturestheir speed as the vehicle pulls away from the moving research vehicle. That is, the radar cancapture the speed of a car in front of the research vehicle or behind. This approach of using radarhas some obvious merits. First, the researcher can ascertain the speed of vehicles accurately, andat two points (back and front of the research ve hicle). The average of the two is plausibly a reliable single measure of the propensity of the driver to speed. However, there is a seriousdrawback to using radar: it sets off radar detectors, triggers an alert on the CB, and slows downtraffic. We suspect that virtually every semi-tr actor trailer driver in North Carolina uses a radar detector, and so do many other drivers. By lis tening on a Citizen Band radio (CB), we verified that there is a high prevalence of CB use announcing the presence of radar. When we set off the256radar, there would almost always be a CB alert broadcast on the local highway, presumably heard by most truckers on the highway within a few-mile stretch. By constantly triggering the radarduring the course of our study, we would be intr oducing bias into the study that we determined would be hard to correct. Another problem with radar equipment is that it is difficult to collectdata systematically on highways while traffic is heavy\u2014vehicles simply approach too quickly toallow you to get readings of every vehicle if you are driving at or below the speed limit. (It isgenerally not possible for safety reasons, of course, to have researchers drive above the speedlimit.) We could have sampled the cars, but that would have meant more time on the highwayand/or introduced more complexity into what was found to be quite a difficult procedure -\u2014recording data on passing vehicles and their drivers. We chose instead a simple, but at first glance seemingly error-prone method: using stopwatches to record how long it takes vehicles to pass our research van (of known length). Themiles per hour of the passing \"subject\" vehicle could be measured quite accurately by tworesearchers, each using a stopwatch, and averaging the two speeds. The stopwatch is started byboth researchers the moment the subject vehicle's front bumper crosses an imaginary lineperpendicular from the research vehicle's (minivan) back bumper, and the watches are stoppedthe moment the subject vehicle's front bumper crosses an imaginary line perpendicular from theresearch vehicle's front bumper. By knowing the time it takes to pass the research vehicle as ittravels at a constant speed, we can easily calculate the speed of the passing vehicle. We discussbelow the fact that we systematically underestimate the speed by this method. However, wecorrect for this underestimation statistically to arrive at what seem like accurate measures of thespeed of the passing subject vehicle.257We estimated that we could observe an adequate number of what we called \"threshold speeders\" by spending approximately 24 hours of one week driving a segment of highwayapproximately 10-15 miles in length, both ways. We were not sure when we started our research what the \"threshold\" of speed was that troopers use to stop motorists, but we estimated that itwould be perhaps 7, or 9, or even 12 miles greater than the posted speed limit. (This wassomewhat in error\u2014see discussion elsewhere in the text.) We chose as many sites as we couldafford to study. Fourteen were studied (although the prevalence of speeding on one of thesegments was greatly reduced by the fact that there was some construction on part of thesegment). These fourteen sites represent highway segments that meet the conditions of beingfour-lane highways, and highways that have fre quent citation events for speeding such that we could compare the citation rates with the speeding rates (see discussion below). We omit detailsof where the fourteen sites are (that would constitute publishing the whereabouts of \"speedtraps\"), but nine sites are along interstate highw ays, four along U.S. highways, and one on a N.C. highway. All are four-lane highways. Three of the sites are on Interstate 95, another four on Interstate 85, and two on Interstate 40. Studying highways with more or less than four lanes was deemed unsafe. Two-lane highways would not permit vehicles to pass us frequently enough, so that it would take manyweeks to accumulate data on passing vehicles. Six- or eight-lane highways (three or four lanes in each direction) were found in our preliminary tests to be very busy highways, complicatingfurther the data collection protocols Moreover, cars that were two lanes away could not as easilybe gaged as to when they crossed the imaginary line extending from the back and front bumpersof our research van. To have chosen any less busy highways, or any with fewer speedingcitations would have been cost prohibitive, as even more time would have to be spent collecting47 We added July to have more observations to compare to and under the logic that the traffic patterns are generally seasonal and that May, June, and July were more likely to be similarthan April, May and June (April being the other month adjacent in time to May and June). 258data at each site. We found that the NCSHP concentrates patrols on particular segments of highway and that we were capturing some of these segments in our research. It is interesting tonote that, although there are stops for speeding duri ng the course of a year between almost any milepost markers on the busier highways (interstates and U.S. highways), stops are much moreconcentrated along certain stretches of highway that run for distances similar in length to those of our selected highway segments. Baseline Data Collection Beginning in January 2000, troopers of the NCSHP were required to collect data on each vehicular stop they initiated. They record the location of the stop by indicating the closest milemarker, wherever such information is available. We found that for the highway segments studiedhere with milepost information (nine), troopers did so more than 90 percent of the time. We wereable to determine how many vehicles were stopped in the fourteen highway segments, and belowwe report a comparison of race-specific rates of stops for speeding to race-specific speedingbehavior in the fourteen highway segments during a time period slightly longer than when wewere collecting data\u2014May through July. (We collected data in May and June, and no highwaysegment was studied for longer than one week during that time period). 47 We extended the time period into July to generate more observations so as to be able to compare the proportion ofspeeders observed who are African American to those who are stopped and/or cited who are African American. 259Data were collected using two research vehicles, with four researchers per vehicle, at two sites per week (one site for each vehicle). Of the four researchers in each van, one drove, onerecorded time of day (to the second), race, gender, and age of driver, as well as other information(color of passing vehicle, state of the license plat e, type of vehicle). The other two researchers timed the passing vehicle from the moment its front bumper crossed an imaginary line drawn inextension from the back bumper of the research vehicle to another imaginary line from the frontbumper of the research vehicle. As mentioned above, fourteen sites were selected using the following criteria. A site had to be a four-lane highway with sufficient reco rded stops (which could result in citations or warnings) throughout a comparable time period (assumed to be May through July) to be able tocompare rates of speeding behavior to rates of stops for speeding. It was judged unsafe to collectthe data on highways that were too busy (for example, during rush hour) or with more than twolanes each way (as discussed above). Cars passing the research vehicle on both sides weredistracting to the driver and the other resear chers, and created \"overload\"\u2014too many cars passing at once. It was all the researchers could do to record the data for each subject vehicle individuallyas it passed on the left of the research vehicle. We also found that it was hard for the driver not toget involved in the data collection process (see discussion below), and if he or she were on athree-lane highway, safety concerns would arise. The fourteen segments had to have an appreciable number of African Americans driving on the segment. Sites to the far west of the state were eliminated due to this criterion. NorthCarolina's African American population largely lives along counties stretching north andeastward from Charlotte to Interstate 95 where Interstate 95 enters Virginia. Many AfricanAmericans in North Carolina also live in the counties along Interstate 40 between Winston-Salem260and Raleigh. These were the areas within which we selected our fourteen sites. Each research site was between 10 and 15 miles in length (one way). The research vehicle traveled back andforth along these segments for approximately 6 hours a day, four days a week (although for somesegments, data were collected for closer to 8 hours a day for three days). Thus, in general, 24hours of observation, consisting usually from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., and again from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., were completed for each of the fourteen sites. Noonhour and afternoon rush hour times were omitted because troopers frequently are attendingaccident scenes at these times, and thus are less likely to be patrolling for speeders then. We alsopreferred to avoid the heavier traffic situations as they seem less safe for driving. Also, underheavy rush hour traffic, speeding is largely limited by traffic density along these heavily-traveledcommuter corridors. Data were gathered during the second week of May until the end of June 2000. Data were subsequently entered by several graduate students into a spreadsheet and \"cleaned\" (corrected)for all fourteen sites. For nine of the segments, mile post data were recorded by the NCSHP, such that we can compare the rate of African American to white stops for speeding with the rate of African American to white speeding within the same highway segment. When we started the study, weassumed that if we found that the rate was higher for stops than for behavior (within a margin oferror), this might support claims of racial discrimination in these locales. However, wesubsequently found that the process is much more complicated than that. More observationswould be desirable (and possibly greater accuracy in assessing speed) to conduct a rigorous test (atest with a narrow margin of error) of the hypothesis at each sight to determine whether or notthere is bias in the workings of the NCSHP.261As part of the study, but not presented here, we employed NCSHP troopers to drive in the vicinity of our research vans. We kept in radi o contact with them and kept varying distances from them so as to best simulate an environment in which troopers identify speeders. Our thinking wasthat it did little good for us to collect speeding data on drivers outside the context of trooperlocation. Thus, it was preferable to collect data on drivers who were driving within a few miles ofan NCSHP car. Troopers stop speeding vehicles that they identify visually\u2014typically through the use of radar\u2014and arguably, many drivers alter their behaviors depending on the speed of thevehicles on the highway around them. Thus, we wanted to capture the speeds of vehicles in thesetypes of contexts. (In a subsequent publication we plan to discuss further the effects that NCSHP proximity had on driving behavior.) Validating the Stopwatch Method In order to test the idea that we could gather reasonably accurate measures of speeding vehicles using stopwatches, we conducted valida tion of the stopwatch method by recording the speed of a passing vehicle using a radar gun. To conduct the validation, we used the NCSHPhighway \"track\" that is normally used for training purposes. We used three vehicles to validatethe ability of each of six researchers to accurate ly time how long it took one of our vehicles to pass another vehicle that was traveling at a faster speed than that of the vehicle being passed. The passing vehicle will be referred to as such, and the vehicle being passed will be referred to as thestopwatch vehicle. In the stopwatch vehicle, researchers recorded the speed of the passing vehicle by timing the amount of time it took the passing vehicle to cross an imaginary lineextending from the back bumper (perpendicular to the side of the vehicle) to another imaginaryline extending similarly from the front bumper. Th e stopwatch vehicle traveled at a constant 3548 The training track was configured such that a speed higher than 35 mph was not possible without risk to the vehicle and passengers. 49 The researchers were graduate students, and it is believed that they followed instructions and did not share time information (in part because the times were different fromone another). We believe the researchers had no motivation to communicate the recorded times,since they did not perceive themselves as bei ng tested, but rather the method was being tested. They were told it was acceptable to miss a speed measurement and to record whatever time wason their stopwatch. The variation in stop times across researchers was somewhat high, relativeto our initial expectations for the accuracy of the stopwatch method, so it is doubtful that theresearchers \"cheated\" and said their times out loud. Additionally, later tests conducted on actualhighways (so called \"same-lane\" tests) further validated the stopwatch method, and for thosetests the stopwatch researchers did not know the speed of the passing cars (which were gaged bythe \"same-lane\" radar gun). 262mph, and included a driver and three researchers equipped with a pencil, pad of paper, and a stopwatch. 48 They were instructed to record the amount of time it took the passing vehicle's front bumper to pass from the stopwatch vehicle's back bumper to front bumper (vehicle length). Theywere instructed to write down the speed as they observed it and not to communicate to others inthe vehicle what time they recorded. 49 The stopwatches were standard \"sport\" stopwatches, and the number of seconds it took for the passing vehicle to pass was recorded, not the speed in milesper hour. The passing vehicle was given a list of \"passing speeds\" at which the driver was todrive the passing vehicle past the stopwatch vehicl e. These speeds varied from about 2 to 20 mph faster than 35 mph. Speeds faster than 20 mph above 35 mph (such as 55 mph) were thought tobe too dangerous for the amount of \"straight aw ay\" available on the training track. It was not thought possible to accurately record the time for speeds significantly faster than 20 mph abovethe speed of the stopwatch vehicle, since such st opwatch times that would be recorded were less than one second (i.e., less than one second would pass between initializing the stop watch andstopping it to read the recorded time.) CB radio was used to communicate between the passingvehicle and a stationary vehicle, which was parked by the side of the road. The researcher in thestationary unit used a radar gun to estimate the speed of the passing vehicle (as well as to estimate50Actually, two radar guns were used. One was supplied by the NCSHP and the other was purchased by the research team. The two were almost identical in the readings made for thepassing vehicle and for the stopwatch vehicle. 263the speed of the stopwatch vehicle, to verify that it was traveling at the designated speed of 35 mph). 50 Also, the passing vehicle's driver had an assistant to record the speed of the passing vehicle. CB radio was also used to communicate between the researcher in the stationary vehicleand the stopwatch vehicle, but using a different channel from that which was used with the passing vehicle. The primary purpose of communicating with the stopwatch vehicle was tocoordinate the efforts of both the moving vehicles. The driver of the passing vehicle did his best to maintain a constant speed while passing the stopwatch vehicle, and the radar gun reading confirmed that this was the case. We maintainedconstant speed in order to more accurately measure the speeds of the passing vehicle, and therebyhelp us verify that the stopwatch method worked. Differences between the radar reading and therecorded speedometer reading were small (or at least seemed small to us at the time - seediscussion below), and in only one test run, varied as much as 3 mph. In most cases the readingswere the same, but in some cases the readings from the radar gun differed by 1 or 2 mph from thatof the driver's speedometer. The training track is a closed circle such that the vehicles (two vans)could drive continuously, but they had to slow down for the curves. The speeds were recordedonly when the passing vehicle was able to pass on the straightaway section of the track. Figure A-1 shows the relationship between the actual speed of the passing vehicle (speedometer speed) and the stopwatch measured speeds for what we call the \"first road test,\" inwhich the first three researchers (out of six total) recorded the times on stopwatches. Because weonly had one stopwatch van, we divided the validation tests into two sessions. In this figure themeasured speed is calculated by miles per hour above the 35 mph of the stopwatch vehicle. 264Figure A-2 shows the same information, but for the second road test (the next three researchers). Separate tests were done for each of the individual researcher's recorded speeds, and correlationsamong the researcher's speeds were found to be between .88 and .99, indicating quite a high levelof reliability by customary standards. That is, the six researchers tested that day tended to varylittle among themselves in their recorded speeds. In the two figures, the horizontal axis represents the speed of the passing vehicle as recorded from the speedometer. Although there is some error in this measurement of thevehicle's speed, it is probably more accurate than the radar estimate of the speed, which is alsoshown in the graph as the hash-marked line (the uppermost line on the graph). Note that thespeed values are sometimes repeated (for example, 44 mph occurs more than once in the first timetrial. Thus, we should not expect any straight lines across this graph). Note that as the actual speed of the passing vehicle increased across trials, the researchers were underestimating to an increasing extent the speeds of the passing vehicle. For example, at40 mph actual speed the estimated speed is just a little less than 40 mph, but at 52 mph actualspeed, the researchers were estimating about 42 mph \u2014roughly 10 mph under the speedometerspeed. Essentially, as the vehicle passed, it took relatively longer for the researchers to stop theirstopwatches. We noticed that researchers virtually never stopped the watches prematurely,meaning before the passing vehicle's front bumpe r actually passed the front bumper of the turtle vehicle. But the faster the passing vehicle's speed, the more distance traveled by the passingvehicle past the stopwatch vehicle's front bumpe r before the researchers stopped their watches. Nevertheless, the researcher's were systematic in their error. As discussed in the next section, wecan correct for the systematic underestimation of speed and generate an estimate of the speed ofthe passing vehicle within a known error range.265Correcting for Under-Estimation of Speed Predicted values from the equation in the above paragraph were found to fit the speedometer speed measure quite well (see Figure A-3 and A-4). Here we took the average oftwo estimates, one from each of two research \"timers\" (we use two stopwatch timers in the observational baseline study of the fourteen sites). Thus, the speeds of Timer 1 and Timer 2 wereaveraged for one estimate for each passing vehicle's speed, and the estimates of Timer 2 andTimer 3 were averaged for the other pair's estimates. Comparisons can be made here with theradar estimate (the dotted line on the graph) or with the horizontal axis (vehicle speed), as theyare very similar. Here one can see that the \"corrected\" estimated speeds of 40 and 52 mph, forexample, correspond with varying degrees of accuracy with the observed speeds. Thus, thesystematic nature of the under-reporting of estimated speed can be capitalized on, in order tocorrect for the speed underestimation.266Figure A-1 Stopwatch Validity Test for First Three Researchers 267Figure A-2. Stopwatch Validity Test of Second Set of Three Researchers 268If one looks closely at the differences between the actual and estimated speeds across values of actual speed, it is arguable that these researchers were somewhat overestimating speedsin the 40-48 mph range, and somewhat underestimating the speed greater than 48 mph. However, in Figure A-4, the three researchers there show no such pattern. Note that on the actual highways of our observational study, our stopwatch van would not be traveling 35 mph, but between 55 and 70 mph. We are assuming that our ability to recordspeeds above the posted speeds on the highway is the same as on the training track. Thus, if apassing vehicle is traveling 50 mph on the training track or 15 mph above 35 mph, the speed ofthe stopwatch van, it is equivalent to a vehicle traveling 80 mph while passing our stopwatch vantraveling 65 mph on an observational study highway segment. We presumed that the risk of being stopped and cited at 15 mph above posted speed was substantial for most highways. At the time we collected the data at the training track, we did notthink it likely that speeds of greater than 15 mph above posted speed would be common. As itturns out, we subsequently learned that 15 mph above posted speed is quite common, and is oftenthe median speed for which drivers are stopped and cited for speeding on the fourteen highwaysegments of our observational study. Thus, it would have been desirable to measure speeds moreaccurately at between 20 and 25 mph above the posted speeds. We assume that the risk of beingstopped and cited may go up substantially as a vehicle's speed rises above the 15 mph speedingthreshold. The implication of these figures is that the researchers' stopwatch times (from recording the time it took for vehicles on the highway to pass them) could be mathematically transformedinto a reasonably accurate estimation of the speed of the passing vehicle by using the regressionequation, discussed in the section above. That is, the estimated speed (raw score speed) could be269multiplied by 1.73 (subtracting .353), to arrive at an estimated speed of the vehicles. Note that we corrected the average speed of the two stopwatch times in the collection of the speeds of the passing vehicles in the road trials across fourteen sites chosen for the baseline observational studydescribed below (although occasionally only one stopwatch time was available). Figure A-3 Corrected Average Speeds, Time Trial One 270Figure A-4 Corrected Average Speeds, Time Trial Two 271Note that, unlike the case with the road testing at the training track described above, passing vehicles on a real highway might accelerate or even decelerate as they passed the researchvehicle. Thus, there might be greater error in recording the actual speed of the passing vehiclethan we observed in the artificial conditions of the training track. Nevertheless, the stopwatchtimers are measuring an \"average speed\" of the vehicle as it passes the research vehicle, and assuch, the estimate should be sufficient to test hypotheses as to differences in speeding behavioracross demographic groups, within a margin of error of a few miles per hour. Moreover, weconducted other tests involving the use of a \"same-lane\" radar gun, which allowed us to assess thespeed of actual vehicles passing a second research vehicle (from a first research vehicle followingroughly 100 yards or so behind the research vehicle). We found that, in general, the recordedspeed did correspond quite accurately to the speed of the passing vehicle measured with the radargun, and that the vast majority of cars passing did so at a reasonably constant speed. It should also be noted, however, that there is a substantial margin of error associated with the estimate of the speed of the passing vehicles. One can get an intuitive sense of the range ofestimated stopwatch speeds by looking carefully at the variation in the graphs in A-3 and A-4. Inpart, the fact that the lines are not smooth speaks to the variation from the speedometer speed(also recall that some speeds are repeated on the horizontal axis as some time trial speeds appearmore than once). In the graph, one can more easily see the differences between the correctedestimate and the radar speed than one can see the differences between the corrected estimate andthe speedometer speed. Therefore, the average of the pairs of timed estimates can be quite different from the radar speed. Also, at the reference lines, one can see that the stopwatch speedvaries by a few miles per hour from the speedometer speed. We ran some simple regressionequations in which the speedometer speed of the passing vehicle was the dependent variable and272the average estimated speed (stopwatch speed) for pairs of observers was the independent variable. The range of standard errors associated with these regression equations varied from2.61 to 5.24, indicating that, on average, an estimate could be wrong by plus or minus 2.6 to 5.2. As it turns out, this is a rather large degree of variation relative to the variation associated withthe measure of speed on the highway by the NCSHP troopers (who generally measure speedwithin 1-2 mph of the best estimate of actual speed). Also, we were surprised when we laterdiscovered that there is a big difference between traveling just a few miles per hour faster or slower than the speeding thresholds on a stretch of highway. When speeding thresholds areexceeded, they trigger a stop and often a citation. A 1 mph difference in speed can make thedifference between whether or not someone receives a citation. The inaccuracies of thestopwatch method will attenuate slightly any correlation between the estimated speed and theactual speed (here we are assuming that is the speedometer speed). As we subsequently learned,the range of likely speed threshold values (speeds that are likely to result in a stop or citation) isquite narrow relative to the accuracy with which we can reliably measure speed, thereby limitingour ability to test hypotheses for each of the f ourteen highway segments.

Six focus groups were conducted in early June 2001. Due the racially sensitive nature of the topic, f our of the six focus groups were race specific (two were African American and two were white). This was deemed appropriate in order to bestprovide a forum where respondents would feel le ss restricted, although each group noted that they would feel comfortable speaking in the presence of fellow troopers. The management andcommand groups were racially diverse. Our random selection process did not capture any femaletroopers (there are few women in the NCSHP relative to men). Focus groups numbered from sixto nine troopers and each lasted approximately 2 hours. The sessions were facilitated by twomembers of the research team. Three other members of the research team observed the sessionsshielded by a one-way glass window. It should be understood that findings from the trooper focus groups cannot be generalized to all NCSHP troopers. They were not selected, nor were they expected, to be spokespersons for their peers. We desired insights into the activities of individuals on patrol in order to betterunderstand what they do and why. Further, the specifics of what we learned from theseindividuals cannot be generalized to other law enforcement agencies (such as local city police)due to the differences in scope of their duties and restricted jurisdiction. For both the general public and the troopers, there appears to be both confusion and disjuncture between what is thought to be \"good\" law enforcement, on the one hand, and \"race-based\" law enforcement on the other. Law enforcement practice, both organizationally andindividually, is influenced in part by a multitude of experiences brought to the table. These \"experiences\" result from an accumulation of identifiable and individual encounters with the277public. They also include generalized expectations of behavior that may or may not be the result of specific or accurate information. The latter generalizing process is best considered to be aprocess of stereotyping. Certain stereotypes a ssociated with minority members of the community may subject them to more intensive scrutiny, may result in defining their behavior as more seriousthan it is and the alleged party as more culpable, and may lead one to believe that thetransgression is more deserving of official inte rvention than would occur in the absence of the stereotype. Whether conscious or unconscious, ster eotypes held related to degree of suspicion, prevalence of crime, or dangerousness can lead to more frequent stops of African Americans and other minorities, as well as influence decisions to release, warn, cite, or search vehicles andoccupants. Race as a profile serves as both a predictor and an explanation for citizen's behavior. It is all too common for individual's to answer the que stions of \"why do you think African Americans are stopped more often than whites?\" or \"why do you police make so many stops in a certainarea\" with simple answers like \"well look at the crime rate, look at the prison population.\" Itwould seem that in most cases, police and citizens do not recognize the disconnect in theiranswers associating the assumed (but often unknown) r obbery rate in a particular part of town and a routine traffic stop in that or another area. Still, the answers are given without blinking an eye and the practices are considered both good policing and a service to the community. Leaving the question of efficiency aside for another time, such proactive policing strategiesmight be viewed as uninformed, but more benign, if racial stereotypes were absent. However, given past and current American race relations, it is quite unlikely that we separate race totallyfrom our thinking about crime. It is precisely th is type of discrimination that can be so harmful278and which has been highlighted in the public controversy over race-based policing. Indeed, the ACLU (1999) notes that \" ... skin color has now become a proxy for criminality.\" For our purposes here, acting out one's racial prejudice through law enforcement, individually or organizationally, is \"racial prof iling.\" Such prejudice can be in the form of presumed criminality, fear of social integration, or a sense of white privilege. Complicating theissue of racial profiling is the extent to which law enforcement decisions are influenced bysocioeconomic standing. To the extent that this is true, the demarcation of what is, and what isnot racial profiling becomes blurred. Below are selected findings from the focus gr oups. Consistent with the structure of the focus groups, proper summary findings are presented in the following areas: 1) Decision to Stop,2) Enforcement Decision, 3) Decision to Search, 4) Minorities and Traffic Stops, and 5) Steps to Stop Racial Profiling. Decision to Stop It appears that troopers, for the most part, engage in enforcement patterns they believe yield the greatest number of enforcement opportunities. A major determinant in the decision tomake a stop appears to be the \"behavior\" of the vehicle. The focus on such behavior seems tovary situationally. The interstate, it is believed, is more likely to yield speeding violations ratherthan seatbelt violations. Participants state that it is not possible to know the race of the driver onthe interstate or at night. Rather, they focus on the behavior of the vehicle. For example, in thecase of Latinos, they are believed to be more likely to violate driving laws. Consider thefollowing participants' comment:279And I think it depends on other factors such as where do you . . . put your selective enforcement. Where are you going to put your people? Just say . . . We haveaccidents in . . . I'm sure. But where are you going to have the most fatalities, areyou going to have up here on north of . . . Road or are going to have them downhere at . . . , you know, where you have got eight or ten beer joints down there,where you know that these people are going to just leave. It has nothing to do withwhether they are black or white, the blacks or whites live in that area, but youhave got all of these beer joints and clubs and stuff down there and these peopleare going to leave this area and they are going to get out there and they are goingto speed and we are going to have fatalities, . . . , you are going to concentrate onthe weekend. You are going to put your people in that area where you see that youhave had these accidents, where you have had fatalities. Where you have hadthese crashes, that is where you are going to assign your people to, during thosetimes. That is what this strategic planning and stuff is suppose to be. Putting yourpeople where you have problems. I'm the same way. I'm in an area where there's a heavy influx of Hispanics and to be downright honest, they're terrible drivers and they get stopped a lot because,you know, you may mistake them for an impaired driver. They get stopped andthere's a big portion of them that are impaired so they account for a lot of ourDWI risks but also they're stopped and given a lot of warning tickets becausethey're just terrible drivers. They don't have a lot of driving experience I don'tthink. They come up here and get mingled in this traffic and they cause a lot ofaccidents. They're a victim because of their driving, because of inexperience. I think stereotyping and violations go together. If you look at a certain group, stereotype a certain group and in that group you deem it to be, have moreviolations, then naturally you will work more at stopping whatever . . . Participants were asked if they believe traffic enforcement was more likely in a \"country club\" area as compared to a \"low-income\" area. The general response is that the law is enforcedwhatever the circumstances without regard to social status. Still, troopers acknowledged that it iseasier, because of reasons out of their control, to do their jobs in some places and not others. Simply, some citizens are more likely to resist the legality of the trooper's action, complain tosupervisors, and challenge the citation. Each of these situations is something that most trooperswould like to avoid. Interestingly, but not surp risingly, it was reported that the NCSHP receives more complaints from whites, as compared to African Americans and Latinos. We had picked up280the same theme in our citizen focus groups. White citizens tended to see any stop as an unnecessary intrusion. African American citizens tended to acknowledge and acceptresponsibility for stops resulting from clear violations of traffic laws. This raises an auxiliaryissue that compounds the problem of racial profiling: how does the coupling of expected resistance from a white\u2014and perhaps more affluent segment of society\u2014 with possiblestereotypes of the minority community (for exampl e, the perception of a certain expected level of law violations) impact the numbers and degrees of disparity in stop outcomes? With regard toresistance, consider the following response (it should be noted that this was not the prevailingnorm): I mean, it might be true now that the area that would display less resistance. I mean if you got a, if you're looking at income, you've got a rich area and a poorneighborhood and if the rich people get nice attorneys and do a lot of things, thenspread the word around as well, then you will be more apt to go to the area whereyou get that less resistance, where you don't get that high-priced attorney puttingyou on the stand and then taking you through all these things. I still think you willwork both but you might at some point go to the other one a little more frequentbecause there's less resistance to, you know, what you're trying to do in the firstplace. Your higher income people generally drink and socialize at places where your lower income people don't. Friday and Saturday night bars where your youngerpeople target, where you have a lot of your calls are searched, a lot of your fights. Your higher income people don't socialize at the places that you make a lot ofthese arrests and get a lot of these calls from. You know, you'll be in the toxilizerroom and occasionally somebody will bring one in where they got picked up. Theywere working the road and you'll pick up a high dollar somebody who just, whosedriving is impaired and they pick those up. As a general rule, I don't think a lot ofyour police officers target the type of places that maybe your more influentialpeople might drink at Holiday Inn lounges and places like this. It normally don't call your attention there. You really don't have a reason to be there like you're called to a lot of other places. The rationale for targeting people of color is founded in one's perspective about what crime is, where it occurs, and the perceived risk to social order. This is a grey area where income281and social status might serve as proxies for race. Still, it should be recognized that even attention to presumed status is a form of stereotyping. Furthermore, differential treatment as a result ofpresumed status may also indirectly but system atically disadvantage African Americans and other ethnic groups. The following quote reflecting \"lifestyle\" differences is a case in point. I would say that is also\u2014I think that one thing that I don't know if it is factored in or not, it is a social behavior, economics has a bearing on what the behavior ofsome people. For example, if you are in . . . where the upper socially economicspredominately live and there are both minorities and Caucasian up here but inproportion, they are mostly white. My experience has been, and it is just myperception, I can't back it up with anything, but their behavior as to how theysocialize is different. It puts them less at risk than the socioeconomic people onthe lower level, be it black or white. By that I mean if they have a house party andthey all camp out at the house and they never leave whereas the lowersocioeconomic people, both black and white, from my experience in . . . and someof these other counties I worked, they were traversed to a place like a tavern orsomething and our guys are circling those bases be it black or white, they are justcircling them and the time that you depend on when they come out of there and youobserve some kind of erratic driving, they are going to get flagged. So they getstopped if it is predominantly black home, then most of the people arrested fromthere are going to be black. While there was acknowledgment of the possibility of racial profiling, it was generally believed that it is an infrequent occurrence today as compared to a more frequent occurrence inyears past. Since the large drug interdiction units were dismantled, and the competitive naturesurrounding the quantity of drugs seized has been lessened, troopers indicated that there havebeen fewer complaints. The following comments reflect the general feeling about the past andpresent levels of race-based law enforcement, also called racial profiling: I think when we had our interstate squads Statewide and they were really looking for drugs and doing more searches, I think since that dissolved I haven't heard thecomplaints about, you know, all these people are being stopped, white or black,and they're being searched because I mean it was kind of like they were makinggreat big drug busts and getting their names in the paper. The Governor wasgiving them awards and blah, blah for getting a tractor-trailer load of dope and$350,000 so I think especially the young guys might have been a little more aptonce they got you stopped to say I may get me a big drug bust here or something282about this guy ain't right and I'm going to search him. I think now that's resolved. I don't think the general population Patrol Statewide are doing numerous searcheslike they were when we had that interstate squad that operated all the way acrossthe country. I haven't heard any complaints in several years now on unreasonablestops and search since the interstate squad went. Well I'd be surprised if you don't have some that do. White and black. I mean, you know, there's no way that in 1,400 or 1,500 people you're going to have 1,400or 1,500 people that's going to go right by the rules, you know? There may be some whites that target blacks and there may be some blacks that target whites or they both may target Hispanics, I don't know. As a whole, I don'tthink the Patrol's got a problem with it. There might be some isolated instances orthere may have been more in the past. I wouldn't dare stand here and tell you Idon't think it ain't never happened cause I'm sure it has. I think awareness has a lot to do with how people respond. In the last probably five years, a lot of emphasis has been put on you might say racial profiling orblack/white issues and I think when people see that, naturally I think they sort ofpull back a little bit because they don't want to be in where the target is. But I'dlike to say that the people you have in the community, when they come into lawenforcement, unless they make a conscious effort to change how they feel and thinkabout others, then that still is prevalent within them even in law enforcement. Ofcourse, being smart and wise, a lot of this may not come out to be where you canreally point and pull it out but I still think people must make a conscious effort tochange the way they was brought up or thinking and look at reality versus what isand what's not and that kind of thing. But I don't think the Patrol has a problemPatrol-wide but I will probably say that there are probably instances that thesethings do take place. Senate Bill 76 mandates that troopers complete the \"stop form\" as a means to better understand law enforcement patterns and practices as well as the socio-demographics of citizensstopped by troopers. Most participants believe such reporting is unproductive and an undueburden on law enforcement personnel. Among other concerns, troopers reported that there wasno way to match the stop forms with citations. One must at least consider the accuracy of theseforms. Consider the following comments: Well see you've got, you've got men writing a certain number of citations and writing a certain number of warning tickets. Now we don't know who these peopleare writing these stop forms because it's a secret number so you don't know if283you've got something wrong in that stop form. They didn't fill out all the blocks. What do you do with it? You don't know who the hell to give it back to and youdon't know who to talk to about it so what do you do with it? Some troopers fill those stop forms out daily and put them in the box. You'll pick them up. The secretary enters them. Some of them will wait until Sunday nightand fill them all out at one time like that. You know, I don't recognize the numberson the top of them but when I enter some of them, some of them I can recognize thehandwriting. But I couldn't a bit more tell you what that man's number is. I don'teven know what my number is right now. If you knew who it was then you could check the number of citations they're putting down and the number of warnings tickets, but that still wouldn't take intoaccount the vehicles they stopped that they didn't do anything on. Enforcement Decision It is not possible for troopers to stop every tr affic infraction; therefore, discretion is a significant consideration. A vast majority of the participants state that they have made up theirmind before the stop as to what action they are going to take, such as a verbal warning, writtenwarning, or citation. They report doing so is a matter of fairness: It is the only fair way to do it. You should issue a citation, it should be based on the violation and not necessarily and not on their personal attitude. If you aregoing to write a person a warning ticket for a 65 and the person is nice to you andthat is what you always do you write a warning ticket, I think you should continue,if you got somebody that ain't so nice, write a warning ticket. I am not there tojudge a person, I mean you stop and you don't got to love them because you stopthem. I understand you write some people a citation and they got to hug your neckbecause you write them a ticket or whatever. You have got to do your job and justgo out and do it. There were clear differences among participants concerning written or verbal warnings. It was expressed by one participant that giving a written warning as opposed to a verbal warningwas necessary to protect oneself in case of a complaint. A warning citation is perceived as a good284tool to promote vehicle safety as well as an effective public relations medium. But in any case, the decision is probably made prior to the stop as noted by the following four participants: And I think the violation of law and to what degree. I mean, most of the time I think when the guys stop the car their mind is made up as to what they're going todo already and if the violation that you write a citation or you write a warning, you just do that but I don't think there's any standard that's set for, you know , clear cut substantial violation to issue a citation for. A potential violation, you give warnings. You know what you are going to do before you get stopped. If it is a clear cut substantial violation, they are going to get a ticket. Otherwise, they are going toget a warning. It is already decided.I see the violation and it is a clear cut substantial. Before I hit my blue light, it is already decided, whoever it is, it is a violation. Decision to Search When asked why they decided to search a car, 64 percent (N = 22) of the troopers stated that they did not search vehicles unless absolutely necessary. Participants cite safety as a majordisincentive for conducting a search. We have some people that do that but it's not very wide across the State because that's a real good way to get hurt to do a lot of searching a vehicle and you don'thave any help. Someone to watch what they're doing while . . . Thus, there were strong sentiments expressed against conducting a search. The most notable exception is the \"plain view search.\" In the state of North Carolina, a police officer is required toaddress any contraband that they see in plain view while executing a duty of their office. It was apparent that the troopers would conduct a vehicle search if the circumstances revealed illegalitems that were in plain view.285The second most prevalent reason to search a vehicle is a \"search incident to arrest.\" The troopers stated that they conduct these types of searches. North Carolina statutes provide that anylaw enforcement officer may conduct a search of an arrestee or the area within the arrestee'simmediate control. This would obviously include the vehicle where appropriate. The primary justification for the \"search incident to arrest\" is officer safety. A similar percentage of trooperswho reported conducting \"searches incident to arrest ,\" also stated that safety was of primary importance when deciding whether or not to conduct a search. If I feel like searching that person, it is because I'm doing it for my safety. I do not want to be riding down the road and have a big old gun come jumping [out] at me. Troopers understood that they had the ability to ask for a \"consent search.\" Law enforcement officers may ask a citizen for consent to search their property as long as a fewconditions are met. First, the law enforcement officer must be sure that the subject does not thinkthey are in custody at the time the request is made. Second, the officer must not imply menace ornegative consequences for a refusal. Troopers noted that search requests are seldom made. [You] put yourself in a bad situation because, how are you going to justify that? You go to an individual and say, you stop the speeding and there ain't nothing else there; [C]an I search your car? If you don't do that on every single stop, there is going to be something[that] look suspicious. Minorities and Traffic Stops Participants report that only a small number of minority stops could be attributed to \"unfair troopers.\" They assert that in an organization their size, there would be some \"badapples.\" They concede that American society is racially divided, and that it would be naive tosuggest that no individuals joining the ranks of law enforcement harbor these sentiments. Whenthose attitudes infiltrate law enforcement agencies via its officers, \"then all you do is put on the286uniform but you are still that same person; therefore, you are prone to have some racial bias.\" However, one third of the participants voiced the belief that, while prejudice exists inside lawenforcement, racial profiling is not a problem. When conducting a routine stop, these troopersbehave in a professional manner. Indeed, most participants believe that the concern about racial profiling is unfounded. They believe profiling to exist when things l ook unusual or out of place, for example, if two African American males are spotted circling someone's house in an all-white neighborhood. Thetroopers label this as profiling because those individuals are considered to be out of place. Theycontend they are trained to profile, that is their profession, but not necessarily racially motivatedprofiles. Overall, the troopers maintain that minorities and others are stopped due to violations ofthe law and not due to race. They also attribute the stops to the geographic location of thepatrolling trooper. If a trooper is patrolling a pr edominately Latino or African American area, he or she is prone to stop the individuals within that ethnic group more because they dominate thatparticular location. With regard to racial differences in driving, a minority of participants maintain that Latinos commonly operate their motor vehicle without a driver's license. This was the mostcommonly noted response from the troopers, and there were no other differences expressed by thetroopers. Participants reported different experiences with how fellow troopers treat minorities and ethnic groups. Some troopers acknowledged that they knew of certain troopers who they believedwere prejudiced against people of color, but ac knowledged that they only knew of a few of them. When asked if people needed to be concerned with racial profiling in North Carolina, one trooperreplied: 287Of course. I mean, as much as I like the guys I work with, you hear remarks. Things that are said. It's not hardcore derogative towards any group but you cantell, yeah, I can see if this person's put in that situation or if well, gee, every blackperson, I stop they're always giving me some mouth you know. Okay, now, depending on how firm you are with that particular person. Now some people are just not as understanding. I'm not saying all of them are like that butsome people are not used to being around blacks. When asked about stereotyping within law enforcement, a few participants agreed that stereotyping existed in law enforcement. Responses provided by the troopers suggest thatstereotyping serves more as \"cues\" in law enforcement. Although responses varied in the degreeof stereotyping taking place within agencies, the troopers who answered the question agreed that it does exist in smaller law enforcement agencies as well as larger ones. Consider the followingparticipant remarks: I just want to say that we are all trained and I do not care what law enforcement agency you are in, you are trained to profile and you act on that. It is inherent. This business requires that. I think stereotyping and violations go together. If you look at a certain group, stereotype a certain group and in that group you deem it to be, have more violations, then naturally you will work more at stopping whatever According to those who believe that stereotyping does not have an impact on general law enforcement practice, a couple troopers thought th at stereotyping did have an impact on who is searched. With the variety of responses provided, it would be reasonable to conclude that the responses are based on the troopers' individual experiences and evaluations of the behavior ofothers. The greater consensus gathered from th e troopers suggests that racial profiling, while not representative of the entire agency, does exist at an individual level\u2014but to a lesser extent todaythan it did in the past. They also recognized that many of the prejudices and much of the bigotry288remains. Generally, they are confident that th eir professionalism and training in the NCSHP keep those problems in check. Still, troopers were less certain that the same could be said for lawenforcement, generally. When asked whether or not they were concerned about being victims ofracial profiling outside of North Carolina\u2014each of the white participants said no; however, a majority of African American participants said yes. Steps to Stop Racial Profiling The eradication of racial profiling was discu ssed by all participants. The most frequent answer was accountability. The second most fr equent response was training and education. You talk about training, we are taught to recognize, to know or recognize some of the effects but the majority of us that are not involved on the interstate team where a lot of those guys are trained into what to look for, doing extensive interviews. Only one subject reported that, in his view, mandatory stop forms would reduce racial profiling in traffic stops. Troopers were aske d if they thought there were some who may misrepresent the race of the person being stopped. One participant stated: When it first came out I heard people say that they were going to be singled out and they feel that way because they stopped five blacks and then you stop fivewhites. Having a camera in the patrol vehicle as a deterrent was questioned by oneparticipant. We just had a trooper transfer from ______, this boy averages six or seven complaints a week. They put a camera in his car to try to, you know, catch him. Now what good is thatgoing to do? The boy is that smart. He's smart, he won't say anything with the camera. They can't get him on anything but let the camera go ahead, he's the biggest asshole you've ever seen in your life. I'm serious. He talks down to people all the time.289More participants believed that cameras serve more as a protection ( for example, protection against complaints), than as a tool to combat racial profiling. A situation I had . . . when a guy stopped this blue jeep Cherokee. It was coming out of Alabama, a black female who alleged that the trooper used racial slurs\u2014because she was stopped by a white trooper. . . Then I asked her did she know thatthe incident, from the time the decision was made by the trooper and the car wasstill rolling before it ever came to a stop, chasing, and all the way up to the timewhen the car pulled off again, after being issued a citation, it had been documented on video and did she know that. She did not know that and the last time I heard from her was she hung up the phone. . . Whether or not Senate Bill 76 will have a substantial effect on law enforcement practices remains to be seen. The stop form appears to be widely resented and viewed as a burden bytroopers. The increased scrutiny of trooper behavior may result in troopers being concernedabout \"balancing the books.\" One participant stated: Yeah, golly, the last four I wrote were whites, so I guess I better write a black person now, or vice versa. Now, whether they actually go and do that, I don t believe that happens, but there is a lot of conscious there, more so than there ever has been in the past. I think most of our people, like me, are dedicated, committedstate troopers who are trying to do a good job if properly guided and led. Ibelieve that what they will do is when they are faced with it, they will deal with it and I don't think it will matter who it is. Conclusion Racial profiling is a multidimensional issue, in other words, disadvantage can appear in numerous ways in a variety of situations. While findings from the focus groups are notconclusive for the collective organization, they provide a better understanding of lawenforcement's perspectives on racial profiling, as well as a contextual framework to assist withthe interpretation of stop and citation data. By way of a caveat, findings from these focus groups290should not be generalized to local and county law enforcement. Their law enforcement functions and cultures are distinct. Law enforcement has the burden of history and perceptions, real or distorted. Historically, racial profiling and racist law enforcement in the United States are unfortunate realities, as notedin works such as that of the Kerner Commission in the mid 1960s. Such practices havecontinued, with and without harmful intent. The issue of prejudice is the engine to such practices,and stereotypes are the fuel. Examples abound that give credence to the public =s concerns. For example, Carl Williams, former Chief of the New Jersey State Police was fired for stating that\"mostly minorities\" trafficked drugs. As we have argued previously, the result of casting a wide\"race\" net is more likely the capture of innocents and not those who are guilty. The wide netshould never be mistaken for \"good\" police work. Most participants acknowledge that theremight be a few troopers that engage in raci al profiling or race-based enforcement; however, accusations of widespread practices are unfounded. It is generally believed that whatever racialprofiling that might have existed in the recent past (middle 1990s) was abated with the de-emphasis of \"drug interdiction\" patrols. Indeed, a vast majority, if not all, of the participantsnote that their decision to initiate a stop is a function of the \"behavior of the vehicle.\" Thus, theybelieve that the issue of race-based decisions to initiate a stop is without merit. However,deployment and enforcement patterns are another issue. It appears that some deploymentdecisions are based on traffic demands (such as a road with a history of accidents or fatalities), and others are based on areas with a significant \"opportunity\" factor, for example, opportunitiesassociated with density of bars. (\"where the fishing is good\"). Such decisions are more likely totarget low-income people (therefore, disproportionately people of color) than their high-incomecounterparts. This is manifested with the presumption that they are less likely to challenge the291action in court and the higher income areas are involved in less overall criminality and disorder. Overwhelmingly, participants report that they do not desire to search vehicles and will only do so as a last resort. This is primarily due to safety concerns. This is contrary to the publicperception of excessive searching vehicles and harassment by troopers. Troopers gave theimpression that they were professional and methodical in their job performance. Indeed, eachnoted that they would have decided what action they were going to take before the vehicle was stopped. The question now is what can be done to eliminate whatever racial profiling might exist. Senate Bill 76 require the completion of \"stop forms.\" Such a requirement undoubtedly creates asense of institutional consciousness about racial profiling. Accountability appears to be an activemanagement concern. Supervisors use multiple strategies to monitor trooper activities, including:1) periodic riding with a trooper, 2) review of citations, and 3) court visits to assess quality ofcharges. The latter management strategies, coupled with a more diverse NCSHP, are possibleavenues to trooper accountability and behavior modification.292Appendix C: Citation Charge versus Reason for Stop In the analysis of Chapters 2 and 3, we generally use what we call the \"citation event data.\" We defined a \"citation event\"as an event during which one or more citation forms are filledout. Each form can have one or two charges listed, but multiple forms can be filled out for thesame event. During the year 2000, up to eighteen charges were filed for any given event. Adriver could have received more than eighteen charges at an event\u2014there is no limit to thenumber of changes a trooper may file relating to a single incident. However, no person in 2000received more than eighteen charges at any single event. When analyzing the charges, we generally assumed that the most salient offense (and the most serious charge) of the citation event was the first charge listed for the event. However, themost serious charge is not always the charge that initially triggers the stop. When we examinedthe data in further detail, we determined that, in most cases, the behavior that caused the stop anda subsequent citation was not necessarily the first charge listed on the citation forms. Forexample, we found records of drivers who were stopped for speeding and for having a revokedlicense. It is more likely that the driver was stopped for speeding and then the trooper discoveredthat the driver had a revoked license. Yet, the revoked license is typically listed as the firstcharge. Appendix C examines in detail the assumption that the first charge listed on the formindicates the behavior that was the likely reason for the stop. We will limit the analysis here tocitations not issued at accidents (under the assumption that our main interest is in trooper-initiatedstops resulting in citations). 293Table C.1 lists all of the citation events for the year 2000 by type of charge. Type of charge consists of several hundred codes that have been collapsed into the eleven categories listedbelow. Appendix D lists the detailed codes and the collapsing rules used to combine them intoeleven categories. The behaviors which constitute the first charges on the citation forms are listeddown the left side of Table C.2. The behaviors that we, the researchers, believe are likely to havebeen the behaviors that triggered the stops are listed across the top of the table. The elevencategories across the top were arrived at by looking at combinations of charges for citation events with more than one charge. If there was more than one charge listed in addition to speeding, wereasoned that speeding would be the behavior most likely to initially trigger a stop \u2014simplybecause speeders usually catch the attention of NCSHP troopers from a substantial distance (thisis always the case when using radar, and typically at a distance of many yards\u2014often severalhundred yards). As can be seen, the vast majority of cases fall along the diagonal of the table,indicating that the first charge is most likely the behavior that triggered the stop. Other behaviors, such as having an expired or revoked license, would not normally be known to the trooper until after he or she had pulled over a driver. Equipment violations might bevisible from afar, but if a speeding charge is also listed, it is more likely that an equipmentviolation became apparent after the car had been pulled over. Essentially, we have imposed ahierarchy of charges as follows (from right to left in the table): speeding, unsafe movement,failure to stop/yield, equipment violations, seatbe lt violations, miscellaneous traffic violations, DUI, license-registration-insurance-type violations, resisting/fleeing, stolen vehicle, and finally a criminal charge. That is, if we find that a citation event has multiple charges, we rank themaccording to this list. For example, if there are three charges, one for speeding, one for equipmentviolation and one for revoked license, we would assume speeding was the charge that brought294about the stop. In the absence of a speeding charge, we would assume it was the equipment violation. The table can be read as follows. As we can see from the percentages (the second number in each cell of the table) , in 97.6 percent of instances in which seatbelt violations are the most likely reason for pull-overs, a seatbelt charge is the first charge listed on the citation form. Whenwe, the researchers, think that DUI triggered the stop, only 86 percent of citations list DUI as thefirst charge. Note that, for some serious charges\u2014namely DUI and license-registration-insuranceviolations\u2014where there is only that one serious charge listed on the form, we will never knowwhat behavior brought about the stop. This is because the trooper decided to simply charge thedriver with the most serious offense and drop the other charges. For example, a driver may havebeen pulled over for speeding and then the trooper discovered that the driver was uninsured. Thedriver might be cited for the lack of insurance, but not the speeding. We would have no record ofthe speeding, but only a record of the insurance violation. As for DUI, it is probable the driverwas observed driving in an irregular way a nd was stopped and found to be DUI\u2014no charges were filed for \"weaving,\" yet it is likely that the driver was stopped for some type of irregular vehicularmovement. We think that the \"license-registration-insurance violations\" charge is considered by troopers to be a serious offense, one that is subject to severe sanctions in the courts. In general, aclear pattern of these charges emerges on the forms on which other charges are also filed. Apparently, a driver will often be stopped for uns afe movement, failure to stop/or yield, or an equipment violation. The trooper then finds that the driver lacks a valid driver's license,insurance, or registration, and as a result of that discovery, the trooper lists the latter offense asthe first charge on the citation form. We assume that this occurs because such offenses are295considered by troopers to be more serious than the violations that likely caused the pull-overs, and so the license, insurance, or registration violation is written-up as the first charge. Othercommon offenses that follow this pattern of being listed as the first change\u2014but not necessarilybeing the triggering charge\u2014are failing to use a seatbelt and DUI. In general it can be said that,even though the first charge is not always the likely reason for the stop, it is usually most seriousof the charges. The fact that the first charge is the more serious charge\u2014and not necessarily the charge that initiated the stop\u2014concerns us. We would like to know which specific behavior triggeredthe pull-over. Given the inadequacies of the stop data, as discussed elsewhere in this report, thecitation data is the primary source of information about which behaviors seemingly trigger anNCSHP intervention. To look at this question further, we next examine the same relationshipbetween the charge that we believe is the most likely behavior to trigger a stop and the firstcharge that the trooper listed. In Table C.2, however, we limit the analysis to only multiplecharge incidents. Again, only citation events not involving an accident are included here, and only citations for African Americans and whites (all others excluded). The top row in eachcategory is the count of the charge and the second row of the category is the percentage of thecolumn total. For example, let us examine the charges of DUI. In the fifth column, in 76.0 percent of the multiple-charge citation events with DUI as the likely reason for the stop, DUI islisted as the first charge. Therefore, in 24.0 percent of the DUI stops resulting in a citation, thefirst charge is something else\u2014almost always a license, registration or insurance violation. Assuming that DUI is a more serious charge than having an expired license, expired registrationor even no insurance, one could say that the NCSHP is not consistent in writing up DUI as thefirst charge (although 76 percent of the time they write the first charge up as a DUI ). 296We summarize the findings in Table C.2 as follows: 1) In 92.5 percent of the speeding pull-overs, the first charge is also listed as speeding. In the 7.5 percent of the cases in whichspeeding is not listed as the first charge, the first charge is most often either a license-registration-insurance violation, or a DUI. Thus, the results follow a pattern of the more serious charge (DUIor license-registration-insurance violations) as the charge listed first. (We assume DUI andlicense-registration-insurance violations are generally more serious than speeding because thepunishments are generally stiffer for these violati ons.) 2) The pattern of discrepancy between a first charge and a pull-over charge is similar for other types of violations as it is for speedingviolations: usually DUI or license-registration-insurance violations appear first among thecitations. For example, in 8.3 percent of the seatbelt pull-overs, a license-registration-insuranceviolation appears first (the most of any non-s eatbelt violation). 3)Where there is a charge of \"unsafe vehicular movement,\" there is often a DUI violation as well, as one might reasonablyexpect. To follow up on the analysis of the relationship between the unsafe movement charge and additional violations listed on the forms, we see that in 35.2 percent of the unsafe movementpull-overs the driver is cited for DUI as the first violation. In another 30.6 percent of cases inwhich unsafe movement appears to be the likely reason for the pull-over, there is also a license-registration-insurance violation. In 16.9 percent of these unsafe movement cases a seatbelt chargeis listed first. 297Table C.1 Likely Reason for Stop by First Charge Likely Reason for the Pull-over by Firs t Charge: All Non-Accident Citation Events mentSpeed- ing Crime # 3589 1 11 155 91 28 47 14 1 33 21 % 100 4.5 7.1 0.2 0.5 1.2 0 0.4 0 0.2 0 Stolen Vehicle#2 1 2 11 % 95.5 0 0 0 Resist, Flee,Escape# 145 39 10 3 9 1 3 21 24 % 92.9 0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0 0 0.1 0 License, InsuranceorRegistra-tion# 71879 2248 395 1933 694 1147 1672 1516 % 99.7 13.4 17.4 1.7 19.1 10.7 11.5 0.5 DUI # 1440 3216 790 103 394 1910 1512 % 86 9.5 0.7 2.8 3.7 13.2 0.5 Misc.

This issue of unsafe movement charges is of special interest in this study because it might be argued that \"unsafe vehicular movement\" is rather subjectively and haphazardly judged by atrooper on the highway. For example, how much \"side to side\" motion of a vehicle is necessaryto have unsafe movement? The present data suggest to us that unsafe vehicular movement (in amultiple charge situation) is often accompanied by other violations of a more serious nature. Notonly are they more serious, but they are not as subjective as connoted in the term \"unsafemovement.\" In the particular cases of license-registration-insurance violations and DUI, thedrivers are almost always guilty of the violation\u2014e ither the driver has a problem with his or her license-registration-insurance or he or she does not , and if the driver is charged with DUI he or she probably failed a breathalizer test. Subsequently, there is little subjectivity involved indetermining whether or not the driver was guilty of these other charges listed first in the multiplecharge citation events. Therefore, if the initial pull-over for \"unsafe movement\" was pre-textualby the NCSHP (a pretext for conducting a vehicular search for drugs), the associated chargeswould in most instances cast doubt upon that interpretation, primarily because the drivers haveoften been found to be unambiguously guilty of something more serious than the subjectiveunsafe movement. In Chapter 4, we show that so few vehicular searches are conducted by theordinary NCSHP troopers that it would seem unlikely that stops for unsafe movement or anyother behavior would often be a pretext for a dr ug search (a somewhat different interpretation is given to the NCSHP Criminal Interdiction Team's procedures and searches\u2014see also Chapter 4). Above, we showed that the first charge and the pull-over charge are not often the same charge. Where there is a difference between the pull-over charge and the first charge, more oftenthan not, the first charge seems to be a more serious charge than the pull-over charge. A more300important question for the current research, however, is whether or not there are any racial differences in the type of charges appearing among the first charge versus the pull-over charge. Table C.3 shows that there are some racial differences for a variety of pull-over charges as theydiffer from three first charges: license-regist ration-insurance violations, DUI, and seatbelt violations. (Too few cases of other offense categories occur to warrant including them in thetable and we drop crime charges, stolen vehicle, and resist/flee violations completely as theyinvolve too few observations to be of concern.) In Table C.3, we can read the table as follows: in multiple charge citation events, if an African American and a white are pulled over for a seatbelt violation, the African American isfound to have a license-registration-insurance violation 7.9 percent of the time, compared to 8.3percent of the time for a white driver. In general, the results of an analysis of Table C.3 suggest that license-registration-insurance violations ar e more prevalent among African American drivers involved in multiple citation events than they are among white drivers. This is not surprisingsince African American drivers are more often cited for license-registration-insurance violations than are whites for one-charge citation events. Here, however, if the first charge were assumed to be the charge that initiated the vehicle pull-over, more error is introduced for African American drivers than for white drivers. Use offirst charge as a proxy for pulled charge would result in disproportionately more AfricanAmericans having license-registration-insurance as the violation that caused the pull-over, ratherthan the behavior that is most likely to have caused it: DUI, miscellaneous traffic violations,equipment violations, failure to stop, unsafe movement, and speeding (seatbelts are the oneexception to the pattern where a slightly higher percentage of whites stopped for seatbeltviolations have license-registration-insurance violations (8.3 percent) than have African301Americans (7.9 percent). Note, however, that a lthough the percentage differences appear to be somewhat large (for example, 28.2 versus 19.9 of the DUI multiple charge events\u2014an 8.3 percentdifference), these represent a much smaller percentage of the all the cases (including the singlecharge events). Thus, for example, if one added up all of the African Americans who were issueda first charge of a license-registration-insurance violation and who were also likely to have beenpulled over for another charge of DUI or other mis cellaneous violation (such as a traffic violation, an equipment violation, or failure to stop/yield vi olation) they would constitute about 1 percent of all African American citation events (1,249 of 122,649 African American citations). Because only a very small bias would be involved in using first charge rather than the charged behavior that we believe is most likely to have triggered the stop, we use first charge inthe analysis of Chapter 2 and 3. (For much of this analysis there is no distinction by type ofcharge and so the issues discussed in this appendix are moot). Although there may be a slightbias in our analysis by not using the charge we think brought about the stop, it is in a knowndirection: more African Americans will appear to have been stopped for license-registration- insurance violations than actually were. One should bear in mind, however, that even though wecould conceivably use our hierarchically derived ch arge that resulted in the stop as the charge for analytic purposes in Chapters 2 and 3, the 1 percent of African American citation events involved(where there is a difference) is much smaller than the 17.3 percent of all African Americancitations in which license-registration-insurance violations are involved. We suspect that, formost of these 17.3 percent of cases, some behavior triggered the stop, but we do not302 have any record of that behavior. In effect , the 1 percent of cases that we could \"correct\" by using our estimate of the charge that initiated the stop would be a very small correction indeed.

Respondents can be asked to report onpolice stops as well as their own driving behavior. Estimates of the magnitude or correlates ofracial disparity in police stops from self-reported survey data are potentially compromised if thereare racial differences in the accuracy of self-re ports of police stops and driving behavior. We report on the results of a record check survey in which we directly assess the degree andconsequences of racial differences in self-reports of police stops. In our sample of drivers who have been cited for speeding in the last year we found that 74.8 percent of whites and 66.8 percentof African Americans admitted to being stopped. Thus, while both groups under-report stops,African Americans do so at a higher rate. This fi nding is consistent with many past studies which report stronger social desirability effects on survey responses among African Americans. Thus,survey data will tend to under estimate the magnitude of the \"driving while black\" phenomenon.We find that the people who fail to report a speeding stop also tend to report lower levels of suchother undesirable driving behaviors as rolling through stops signs and speeding. There were no race by reporting interactions in reports of other driving behaviors. An early draft of this paper was presented at the American Society of Criminology Meeting. November 17, 2000, San Francisco, California. Contact Tomaskovic-Devey don_tomaskovic- devey@ncsu.edu or at above address. Introduction Much of the research on the \"driving while black\" phenomenon relies on what we can learn about police stops recorded in the police reports filed related to the incident. Ordinarily,official records capture information for citations and searches, and some police organizations334officially record written warnings. As useful as this information may be, a large number of stops are not routinely and officially recorded and are thus missing for purposes of analysis. Thisunfortunate omission of stop information makes it difficult to address two key questions related to racial profiling: 1) Are minority citizens the targ et for unwarranted stops in order to further investigate the driver and/or occupants of the vehicle? (such stops could be considered pure harassment); 2) Are the post-stop experiences of minority citizens different than the experiencesof majority citizens? A recent report (Langan et al. 2001) suggests that we can assess the magnitude of \"driving while black\" and learn a great deal about the quality of those interactions by directly surveyingand asking drivers about their stop experiences. In a survey context, it is also possible to askdrivers about their driving behavior and then model, from the drivers' points of view, the probability of stops having been initiated by the drivers' driving behavior as well as their personaldemographics. The types of models we have in mind might regress the probability of beingstopped because of race, while controlling for racial differences in age, gender, miles driven,highway versus local driving, tendency to speed, and tendency to violate routine drivingregulations (rolling through stop signs, failure to use seat belts). To the extent that self-reportdriver surveys can inform racial profiling research, such a technique may prove to be valuable tolaw enforcement agencies and communities looking for a simple and straightforward means bywhich they can assess police-citizen contacts. Using self-report survey data may also appear to be as flawed as simply reviewing written records of stop, citation, and warning data. Survey responses may under-report police stopsbecause of the sensitive nature of reporting violations of traffic and other laws and drivers'distrust of the police or surveys in general. Responses may also over-report police stops because335of the high profile and political nature of the i ssue. If sources of non-reporting are associated with the race of respondent, then survey-based analyses may be misleading\u2014either byexaggerating or underestimating the degree of racial disparity in police stops. For example, of the drivers in our North Carolina Citizen Survey, 18.1 percent of whites and 26.4 percent of African Americans report being pulled over by police in the last year. Giventhese self-reports, we might conclude that African Americans are 1.45 times more likely to bepulled over than whites. But are they actually pulled over at that rate? Researchers answeringyes to this question must make the strong assumption that white and African American drivers areequally likely to accurately report being pulled over. As we will see, a review of the literatureindicates that a significant number of African Americans tend to under-report in response to alltypes of questions that they interpret as being potentially threatening, sensitive or embarrassing ata much higher rate than most whites typically under-report in response to the same questions. In order to test the assumption that there is no racial variance in under-reporting instances ofbeing pulled over by police, we conducted a Record Check Survey of North Carolina drivers withknown speeding citations in North Carolina. In a standard record check survey, the investigatorknows the answer to the question before administering the survey, and then he or she surveysrespondents to measure the accuracy of their responses compared to the original records. Background Literature Item Under- or Non-Reporting for Sensitive Questions Our chief undertakings in the record check survey are to discover the levels and types of inaccuracy in survey data and to identify the characteristics of inaccurate responders. Sudman and Bradburn (1982) identified four factors related to survey response errors: memory,336motivation, communication, and knowledge. Motivation errors are the major concern of this part of the report. Motivation errors are inaccurate answers to survey questions which occur solelybecause the respondent wants to manage the interaction in order to be viewed in a more positivelight by the interviewer. Motivation-based reporting errors are most likely to occur when thesurvey item elicits a social desirability response. This type of reporting bias can manifest itself asnon-reporting, over-reporting, and/or under-reporting. Over-reporting is a common occurrence for survey items that measure socially desirable activities such as voting. Under-reporting is more common for survey items that measureundesirable activities, for example, drug use (see Sudman and Bradburn, 1979 for a review). Inthe literature, questions asking about undesirable activities are often referred to as \"threatening\"or \"sensitive\" questions. These types of questions encompass activities which are thought to beprivate, embarrassing, or illegal (such as personal income, party affiliation, religion, sexualhabits, or criminal activity). Respondents generally under-report when answering these types ofsensitive questions because they think that by admitting to having engaged in such behaviors,theinterviewer would not view them as favorably as they might have having not know about these so-called sensitive behaviors. Social desirability is thought to be at the root of non-response andunder-reporting to sensitive questions (Kormendi, 1988). These two phenomena are directlyconnected to the reduced accuracy or validity of an swers. Self-reports of police stops clearly are instances of threatening questions at risk for a social desirability-based under-reporting.Threatening question item response rates vary by study. The non-response rates tend to rangefrom fewer than 5 percent for questions considered to be less threatening (such as witnessing acrime but not reporting it, Clark and Tifft, 1968), to as high as 73 percent for questions considered to be more threatening (such as bankruptcy, Bra dburn et al., 1979). The topic of victimization,337often studied with the use of questions considered to be potentially threatening, has been repeatedly studied. The reviews of this research show that victimization is consistently under-reported (Czaja et al, 1994; Yost and Dodge, 1970; Dodge, 1970; and Turner, 1972). In fact, research indicates a direct relationship: the more extreme the crime, the greater the under-reporting. For example, the findings in the victimization studies show larger under-reporting onquestions about assault than for questions about burglary. Race and Item Under- or Non-Reporting for Sensitive Questions Stocking (1979) used the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (Crowne and Marlowe, 1960, 1964) to review these studies. He found that nonwhite respondents are morelikely to attempt to please the interviewer by giving socially acceptable answers to sensitivequestions. African Americans are more likely to complete interviews (thereby cooperating withthe interviewer), but the information may be less valid in response to sensitive questions due tothe respondents' attempts to provide socially acceptable answers. Indeed, overall, African Americans, as a group, are more likely than whites to respond to surveys (Groves and Couper, 1998, Cohen and Carlson, 1995, Brehm, 1993, Jackson et al, 1982, O'Neil, 1979, Hawkins, 1975). For our purposes, those drivers who refuse to be interviewed are not as important to the study as is our ability as researchers to discern whether or not the information provided by thedriver in the interview is accurate\u2014especially the responses to what may be interpreted by thedrivers as threatening questions. Women, nonwhites, and those with lower levels of education aremore likely to under-report unacceptable behaviors or counter-normative attitudes (DeLamter, 1982:168). Sudman and Bradburn (1974), summarizing previous research on responses to338attitude questions, report that, for those questions arousing concern, African Americans are more likely to have a response effect than whites. Witt et al (1992), in a study of item non-response toquestions about drug use, report that nonwhites are more likely to be item non-respondents thanwhites. Cox et al. (1992) found that, compared to whites, African Americans and Hispanics notonly had a higher non-response rate, but also higher incidences of inconsistent responses foranswers to questions about drug use. Previous research using the record check survey methods have found further evidence of African Americans being more likely to under-report sensitive or threatening questions. Czaja etal (1994), for example, examined respondents' strategies for the recall of crime victimizationincidents. They found that 71 percent of whites reported victimization\u2014compared to only 44percent of African Americans. Hence, the odds of whites reporting their victimization was 1.9times higher than nonwhites (see also Sparks 1981, Biderman and Lynch 1981, and Dodge 1983,for similar findings on victimization; see Czaj a and Blair 1990, and Czaja et al 1992, for studies on other types of questions). There is also evidence that African Americans are more likely thanwhites to conform, or acquiesce to questions with positive social desirability cues (Lenski andLeggett, 1960 and Hare, 1960). Record Check Surveys The validity of self-reported behaviors that violate state or federal laws are often questionable because of the afore-mentioned problems of under-reporting and incomplete orinaccurate reports. It seems that participants, in their attempts to be both good respondents (byanswering the question) and to present a positive self-image to the interviewer, often do notrefuse to answer the question. Instead, more often, they report that they did not engage in the339threatening behavior being asked about (Bradbur n et al 1978). For instance, Clark and Tifft (1966), using a polygraph to check validity, found that 15 percent of the respondents refused toanswer a question on speeding while 38 percent of respondents under-reported speeding. In this study, the possible consequences of more under-reporting by African Americans compared to whites would be to under-estimate the extent of the \"driving while black\"phenomenon. Conversely, if African Americans are more likely than whites to report stops, thisfactor could result in exaggerated indictment of law enforcement behavior. While the previous literature strongly suggests that African Americans are less likely than whites to reportthreatening behavior, it may be that the current politicization of the \"driving while black\"phenomenon encourages African Americans to recall and report driving stops. Since mediareports tend to place the blame for stops on police and not African American drivers, the socialdesirability effects may be weakened for reports of police stops of African Americans in thecurrent political climate. One method used to identify under-reporting and inaccurate respondent reports is to conduct a record check survey. The Record check survey is a methodological tool used toevaluate the validity and accuracy of respondents' answers. Researchers create a survey, askingquestions about information about the individuals who are surveyed that the researchers alreadyhave. Data collected from the respondents can then be compared to the known answers\u2014 therebyeffectively assessing the accuracy of the respondents' answers. The purposes of the Record check survey in this study are to determine whether or not drivers who have been stopped by police arewilling to report the stops during a telephone interview, and to assess how accurately the driversreport the incidents. Using the findings from a Record check survey allows researchers\u2014withoutaccess to respondents' known behaviors\u2014to statistically compensate for under-reporting.340The design of the National Crime Survey (NCS) included three record check surveys. In these record checks, police reports were compared to survey answers for a sample of citizens withknown police contacts (Yost and Dodge, 1970; Dodge, 1970; and Turner, 1972). Based on thefindings from these record check surveys, the National Crime Survey was then redesigned to usesurvey items that produced less under-reporting. While we have built some question-wordingexperiments into our survey to improve future surveys on police stops of motorists, our primaryobjective is to determine whether or not racial differences in the probability of under-reportingpolice stops effect estimates of the magnitude or existence of the \"driving while black\"phenomenon. Study Methods Design of North Carolina Record Check Survey Since our research question focuses directly on the relationship between the race of the respondent and his or her propensity to be stopped by the police for speeding, we are specificallyinterested in race-based variation in reporting of police stops. While studying the validity ofrespondent answers is important in its own right, the overarching goal of our record check surveyis to increase the precision of estimates of race-based response variation in citizen surveys. For the North Carolina Record Check Survey, a sample of known North Carolina speeders were selected from a database of North Carolina citizens who had been ticketed for speedingbetween June 1, 1999 and June 1, 2000. The list of inclusive names was obtained from the N. C.Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC). We us ed the list of names of ticketed drivers within the one-year period as the population from which we drew a stratified weighted sample of names. Our targeted goal was 600 completed surveys. We weighted our sample in order to haveapproximately one-half African American res pondents and one-half white respondents. This341weighted sample design was advantageous because our research question concentrates on discovering adjustment measures for race-based differentials in response to police stops. Thecooperation rate for the survey was 70 percent for white respondents and 69 percent for AfricanAmerican respondents. As in previous research, whites refused to participate at slightly higher rates and African Americans were slightly more difficult to locate. It is more difficult to findvalid phone numbers for African Americans than for whites,, but African Americans cooperatewith the survey at higher rates than do whites. One week before the initial telephone contact attempt, advance letters were sent to each of the persons included in the sample. The letters explained that the survey focused on the drivingexperiences of people in North Carolina and their observations of other drivers on North Carolinaroads, and the results would be used to aid traffic safety and policy decisions. The survey itselfwas administered by telephone and averaged nine minutes to complete. Most of that time isallocated to general driving questions, designed partly to reduce the threat associated withquestions about police stops. In addition to our goal of finding estimates of response bias, we also included an experimental manipulation of the wording in one-half of the questionnaires to estimate the effects of the wording of threatening questions on question response. We will reportthe results of that experimental manipulation in a future paper. One issue of concern in record check surveys of stopped drivers is the possibility that interviewers will know or guess that everyone had been stopped and so encourage higher self-reports. As a precaution to minimize such potential interviewer bias, previous researchers haveseeded record check survey samples with respondents who had not experienced the event inquestion (Sudman, et al, 1977). Because we were fielding a larger survey with many of the samequestions, and also because the record check su rvey contained an experimental manipulation, we342simply informed the interviewers that the three surveys were linked and contained experiments in question wording and questionnaire design. Th erefore, the high proportion of respondents reporting stops in the last year in the record check survey was disguised by the much largernumber of respondents reporting no stops in the larger driver survey. Analyses Since all respondents selected for our surveyhad been stopped for speeding, the record check survey concerns the probability of a respondent admitting to the speeding stop event. Weare particularly interested in any racial differences in reporting speeding stops, since the largerproject uses survey self-reports as one avenue of exploring the \"driving while black\"phenomenon. Response Bias in Reports of Police Stops Table E.1 shows the distributions of drivers admitting to having been stopped by the police. The findings from the record check survey are that we can expect police stops of all typesto be under-reported by about 29 percent, and that there is a significant racial difference in self-reports of stops. Whites are 8 percent more likely to report any stops than are African Americans. Table E.2 reports the core of the reverse record check, self-reports of speeding stops among drivers whom we know, from official records, had been stopped for speeding in the lastyear. Thirty percent of drivers do not report the specific speeding event which we used to selectthem for the sample. There is a significant racial difference in self-reports: African Americans 343Table E.1 Self -Reports of Stops by Police in the Last Year by Race One or More Stops Reported No Stops Reported Total (n=604) 70.8% (427) 29.2% (176) Chi-Square = 4.639 Probability = (n=305) (228) 25.2% (77) African American (n=299) 66.8% (199) 33.2% (99) are 2.9 percent less likely than whites to admit to a speeding stop which happened in the last year. This suggests that survey-based self-reports of police stops may under-represent actual racialdisparities in police activity. Table E.2 Self-Reports of Speeding Stops by Police in the Last Year by Race Percent of One or More Stops ReportedPercent of NoStops Reported Total (n=602) 63.5 36.5 Chi-Square = .001White (n=305) 69.8 30.2 African American (n=297) 56.9 43.1 Since the probability of speeding and being stopped is tied to other demographic characteristics that may be associated with race, we examine whether or not this basic finding issustained after controls are applied for gender, age, education, and home ownership (as a proxyfor social class). Table E.3 reports a logistic regression of self-reports of speeding stops upon race as well as a series of demographic and behavi oral control variables. The findings from the models indicate that racial differences in th e reporting of police stops is sustained after controlling for gender, age, education, and home ownership. Model 2 also suggests that youngerdrivers are more likely to report their speeding stops than men and older drivers. We also ran344interactions of race with age, gender, education, and home ownership. The racial differences in self-reported speeding behaviors do not interact with any of these correlates of race.

In this section, we usethe racial differences in any stop reports from Ta ble E.1 to estimate racial differences in police stops using a larger, general survey of North Carolina drivers.345Table E.4 Full Survey Preliminary Estimates of Racial Differences in Police Pull- overs, Adjusting for Response Bias Self-Reported Stops Adjusted for Response Bias White African AmericanWhite (267 Self-Reported Stops/.748)African American (360 Self-Reported Stops/.669) Drivers with 267 538Total African American/White Stops1.47 1.65 From the main survey of drivers we have data on 1,477 white drivers and 1,368 African American drivers. Of the 1,477 white drivers, 18.1 percent report being pulled over by police inthe last year. African Americans report being pulled over about 45 percent more often\u201426.3percent of the African American respondents report being pulled over by police in the last year. The reverse record check results suggest that both of these are likely to be under- estimates. Recall that in Table E.1 we saw that whites reported only 74.8 percent of actual stopsand African Americans reported even less\u2014at 66.9 percent. We can calculate, based on reportedstops, the likely actual incidence of stops within race. For whites, that number is 356 (267 self-reported stops divided by .748) and for African Am ericans, our estimated number of stops is 538 (360 self-reported stops divided by .669). Thus, the reverse record check suggests that the driversurvey estimate of racial differences in stops (Table E.4) should be adjusted upward based onracial differences in self-reports of stops. The self-report data suggest that African Americans are 1.45 times more likely than whites to have been pulled over in the last year. Adjusting for346response bias based on the reverse record check, the data suggest that African Americans are actually 1.65 times as likely to have been stopped in the last year. Response Bias and Self-Reports of Other Driving Behaviors An additional goal of the driver survey is to identify racial differences (if any) in risky driving behavior. Using the data from the reverse record check survey, Tables E.5 and E.6produce estimates of racial differences in reporte d risky driving behavior among those that report and fail to report speeding stop incidences. In this analysis, we investigate if the response biasidentified in the record check survey is associated with racial differences in self-reports of driving behavior. The dependent variable in Table E.5 is an additive scale of that we refer to as \"risky driving behavior.\" It is meant to capture some of the driving behaviors that, while seeminglyminor, could bring one to the attention of a poli ce officer. Risky driving behavior sums self- reports of rolling through stop signs, speeding up for yellow lights, failure to signal, and not usingseat belts. African Americans report .44 fewer ri sky behaviors, significantly less than reported by white drivers. This number is reduced slightly af ter controls for accurate self-reports of speeding stops, but shows no significant interaction with bi as in reporting speeding behavior. Drivers who fail to self-report speeding stops also report signi ficantly fewer (.26) risky driving behaviors. In Table E.6, we examine self-reports of typical speeds driven in 35 mph and 65 mph speed limit zones. There are no significant racial differences in self-reported speeding behaviorin a 35 mph zone. African Americans report driving more than 1 mph slower than whites in a 6551We repeated the analyses in Table E.6 using a dummy variable for reporting driving 10 or more miles per hour above the speed limit, and the results were the same. We also re-ran theanalyses in both Tables E.5 and E.6, deleting a single African American case with very lowreported normal driving speeds, but the substantive results were unchanged. 347mph zone. For both speed limits, those who are more likely to admit being stopped also admit to higher typical driving speeds. In neither case is there a significant interaction with race.51 Table E.5 Regressions of Self-reported Risk y Driving Behavior on Self-report of Stops, Race, and Their Interaction; Metric Coefficient (Significance), n=604 .

First, respondents who are truthful on the record check question are also likely to report higher rates of illegal driving behavior. We interpret this torepresent a general tendency toward a more accurate response to threatening survey questionsamong this population. To test this conclusion we also ran a secondary analysis of348nonthreatening questions--\u2014self-reports of miles driven last week and per year. In neither case was non-response on the reverse record check associated with self-reports of miles driven. Thus,when the question was nonthreatening, there was no bias associated with a tendency to accuratelyself-report a speeding stop. The second conclusion is that non-response bias in reporting policestops is unlikely to effect estimates of race differences in driving behavior. Conclusions As in past research, we find that African Americans are more likely than whites to give socially desirable answers to threatening survey questions. This tendency means that surveys ofdrivers designed to estimate the magnitude of the \"driving while black\" phenomenon will tend tounderestimate police stops for both minority and majority drivers. This tendency will, however,be greater for African Americans. Therefore, survey reports of police stops will tend tounderestimate the actual degree of racial disparity in police stops. Respondents who fail to report police stops are also likely to provide more socially appropriate responses to questions on risky driv ing behaviors or speeding. There is, however, no evidence that African Americans are particularly likely to under-report either risky drivingbehaviors or speeding. Evidently, the degree of threat in these items is not sufficient to producethe type of race-linked social desirability responses we see for reports of police stops. Thissimplifies the use of survey data on race and police stops. Survey-based estimates of the magnitude of the \"driving while black\" phenomenon are likely to underestimate the true degree of racial disparity in police stops. In the North CarolinaRecord Check Survey, we found that 69.8 percent of whites and 56.9 percent of AfricanAmericans who had been stopped for speeding in the last year actually reported such stops. This349suggests that self-reports of speeding stops by whites will be under-reported by about 31 percent. Similarly, African American self-reports of speedi ng stops, at least in North Carolina, are likely to be under-reported by 43 percent. Self-reports of police stops from survey data should probablybe adjusted upward to reflect these biases. Similarly, multivariate statistical analyses of thecauses of police stops (for example, race, gende r, age, or driving behavior) should probably be weighted so that those who report stops repr esent their expected proportion in a population.350Appendix F: Citizen Focus Groups Citizen Perception of the \"Driving While Black\" Phenomenon: Research Summary From Six Focus Groups A version of this Appendix was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Criminology. San Francisco, November 17, 2000. C. Robert Fenlon (North Carolina Central University) was author.351Introduction Focus group research in this study of citizen perception of \"driving while black\" is mainly used to gather qualitative data to explore several issues. These are the reported andperceived reasons for police stops, the perceive d treatment of citizens by North Carolina State Highway Patrol (NCSHP) troopers as reported by the respondents, their experiences with otherlaw enforcement encounters (local and county), how the police-citizen encounter began anddeveloped, and what knowledge citizens can report about police-citizen encounters by othercommunity members, friends and relatives. As such, our intent is to gather information onpersonal experiences with the NCSHP troopers and other law enforcement officers, as well as\"vicarious\" information as reported by the res pondents regarding knowledge of racial profiling. Focus groups can provide a source of detailed information about a particular social phenomenon that may not be otherwise captured with more traditional methodologicalapproaches. Some would argue that an over-reliance on strictly quantitative methodology hindersthe complete understanding of the issue being studied (Krueger, 1994). The focus grouptechnique, as a data collection method used in c onjunction with the information obtained from the larger study, is an effective way to extract respondents' attitudes, opinions, and knowledgethrough the use of probing, specific questions in order to obtain information on an issue such asracial profiling. Morgan (1988) points out that focus groups allow for uncovering what individuals think and why they think the way they do about an issue. Focus groups allow an examination ofinteractions in a group setting, wherein how indivi duals in the group react to other opinions and352how they respond to opinions that might be so mewhat different from their own (Morgan, 1996) can be assessed. We gathered indepth information from four African American focus groups and two white focus groups in four geographically distinct locations in North Carolina. Literature Overview Absent the existence of a federal reporting system capturing information on police- community conflict, generally, and overall police misconduct specifically, systematicallygathered information about racial profiling is sp arse. The issue of racial profiling is grounded in the history of the often controversial relationship between the police and minority groups. Evidence does suggest that conflict and tension between the police and the community hassteadily increased since the 1960s, when strained police-community relations were indicated as acontributing cause of turmoil and civil disturbances in more than 150 American communities(National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, 1968). Several studies (Carter 1985; Dugan& Breda 1991; Gallup 1997, Henderson 1990; Radelet1986; Weitzer and Tuch 1999; and Weitzer 2000) have indicated that minorities (African Americans and Hispanics) have less confidence in law enforcement relative to whites. However,most studies to date indicate that the overwhelming majority of citizens\u2014white andminority\u2014report positive perceptions of police (Radelet, 1998). Even though a majority of citizens in the United States have positive views of the police, African Americans are more likely to believe that the police treat their community concerns withindifference, to feel that their neighborhoods receive inferior treatment relative to white353neighborhoods, and to believe that they are more likely to be targeted unfairly by the police due to their race (Weitzer, 2000). In a more recent examination of public perception of the police, Radelet and Carter (1994) reported that African Americans indicated the following complaints: > Substandard or poor police protection > Substandard or poor service to minorities, especially inner-city residents> The expectation that the police will not treat them fairly> Numerous incidents of verbal abuse and harassment> Stereotyping of minorities as criminals, particularly in \"stop and frisk incidents\"> Police use of excessive force> Discrimination in police personnel administration. Still, Murty, Roebuck and Smith (1990) conducted a study assessing public perception of thepolice in predominately African American communities in Atlanta, Georgia. They sampled 600African Americans, and their results indicated that 65 percent expressed a positive attitude of thepolice while 35 percent expressed a negative attitude. Lastly, Weitzer's (2000) study examines citizens' perceptions of racialized policing in three Washington, D.C. neighborhoods: a middle-cl ass white community, a middle-class African American community, and lower-class African Amer ican community. His findings indicate that there is across the board agreement that police treat African Americans differently from whites. Most of the white respondents in his study took the position that black crime and criminality leadsto discriminatory, yet justifiable, treatment because \"blacks have a greater likelihood or a higherrate of black involvement in crime in Washington, D.C.\" This seems to be the modal explanationfor the white community as to why African Americans are treated more harshly by the police. Itwas interesting to note that a minority of African American respondents held the same view,cutting across similar logical deductions, correctly or not, regarding this rational of policetreatment of African Americans. 354Overall, given limited research, minority perceptions of police are more negative than whites. This is understandable given the history of relations between minorities and lawenforcement in the United States. Racial profiling or \"driving while black\" seems to be indicativeof the historical relations between the police and minorities. Methodology This focus group research study on public perception of racial profiling used an exploratory methodological design approach to help better understand this issue. The results areintended to stand on their own without any follow-ups. The research team chose to conduct focusgroups in four major North Carolina cites distributed across the state. Four African American and two white focus groups were conducted. The research team determined that segmentation wasneeded to create groups of similar racial makeup due to the nature of the issue, racial profiling. Toachieve the highest quality of information, maintain an environment conducive to forthrightopinions that are not guarded or masked, and overall, make focus group respondents feel morecomfortable, we believed that intra-racial composition was needed. Each focus group, withconsideration for age and gender, consisted of ten persons from the same race, having a range inages from 24 to 60, and had at least four females . The two white focus groups were held in thesame city, in succession after two of the African American focus groups. Respondents wereselected by a research firm located in each selected city. Two trained facilitators external to the research team were used to conduct the focus group sessions. The research team believed that an intra-race facilitator and respondent were needed.Both moderators had considerable experience conducting focus groups on sensitive issues. Eachsession lasted approximately 90 minutes and on some occasions went beyond this time mark. 355Debriefing sessions were held subsequent to each focus group session, in order to discuss observations made by the moderator and the research team regarding facilitating style andparticipant responses. At each focus group session, the research team took notes in anobservation room within each facility from behind a one-way mirror. Each of the respondentsvoluntarily agreed to participate and signed permission forms allowing them to be recorded andvideo taped at each of the focus group sessions. However, no last names were used in discussionsor recorded to ensure confidentiality. The audio tapes of each session were transcribed and sentto the research team along with the video tapes. The moderator of each focus groups imposed two kinds of structures: areas at issue and the level of control exerted to complete the information gathering process in the allotted time. Atthe onset of each focus group, the moderator opened with an introduction that fully explained theintent and purpose of the research being conducted, who was doing the research and why, andwhat was expected of them, so that each of the respondents understood the nature the researchstudy. The following issues were discussed: < Personal feelings in general about the police; < Differences in police behavior by type/jurisdic tion of officer (such as local, county, and state); < Personal experiences involving police stops; < Reasons why police may target African Americans drivers. Data Analysis We were looking for direct information, expressed by focus group respondents, that exemplified the core of the issues. While preliminary, the results reported here do reflect theresearch team's overall assessment of the tone, flavor, and direction of the focus group analysis. 356This afternoon we will address some of the material where it best highlights the commonalities and differences in the experiences and perceptions of racial profiling within the white and African American groups. Issue One: General Feeling Toward the Police It was perceived by the researchers that the general feeling toward police overall was positive in the African American focus groups. African Americans generally expressed a positivenotion about police performance, practices, and behavior when addressing the safeguarding of their community. While African American citizens held favorable views of police in general,they expressed a tremendous distrust of police as individuals. For example, one respondentindicated \"policemen are humans, too, but there are good ones and there are bad ones . . . and it's the bad ones that give the entire police department a bad name.\" Another respondent explained his mistrust of police, even though he had not had any negative experiences with them, in this way: \"Well, I personally, I'd never had a bad run in with any police officer. But, I am afraid of them.\" In another focus group located in the western part of North Carolina, respondents expressed similar sentiments as well. They ebelieved that police are there to protect and serve thecommunity, and that they do a good job as a whole. However, a statement made by one of theparticipants illustrates the gulf that exists between acceptance of what law enforcement isintended to accomplish and the level of trust in the expectation that this will be accomplished: \"They are there to protect and serve but you have to be cautious of them. . . . I have never had a run in with the police. . . . but I would not necessarily put my guarddown around a police officer.\"357Within the same focus group, two respondents had different views of the police in their assessment. \"Growing up, policemen were portrayed as good . . . now they're portrayed as bad . . . when I see a police I always think negative. I don't think positive.\" The other respondent indicated \"when I was younger, I guess I was a little bit negative about the police . . . but as I got older, got to meet some of them personally, heard their point of view . . . it is avery challenging a whole . . . I think they're going a good job\" The white respondents had very positive perceptions of the police. It seemed to us that white citizen participants saw police activity (enforcement) as external to their community. Enforcement, as it should be, is focused where \"law and order\" seem to be more of a problem. The white respondents, as a whole, seemed to have a sense that police service their communitywith little or no conflict; therefore, they felt comfortable with police presence. They seemedwilling to give up on some freedom, such as stops at police check points, and did not see suchinconveniences as an intrusion on their rights. They did not expect such stops to have any greateffect on their neighborhoods, since most of the crime committed is outside their community. One respondent indicated the following: \"They (police) patrol areas where there are potential problems . . . stop things, you know, drug areas they drive through and try to prevent things from happening.\" Another respondent had this to say about the police: \"You have got the rule of law and the poli ce are the ones that enforce that . . . they keep the order . . . and if they (police) have a license check set up . . . have drug dogs .. . . check it out . . . in it has caught a lot ofpeople . . . I for one think its worth a slight inconvenience to get that (drugs) off the road. I very much support him (police).\"358Issue Two: Compared Types of Law Enforcement African American citizens reported a sense that NCSHP troopers were more professional in their dealings with the public than were local law enforcement. They attributed this differencesto the level of training received by each. Citizens also spoke negatively of the stereotypicalsheriff lounging across the food counter at the c onvenience store with his shirt hanging out. It was believed that the NCSHP would enforce the law more consistently and would rely onpersonal relationships with citizens less often in determining the final outcome of the stop thanlocal law enforcement would. On balance, African American citizens expected to be treatedfairly by the NCSHP but not so fairly by local police. \"I feel that they are more professional, the state troopers.\" \"If you are speeding, they are going to give you a ticket.\"\"If you are breaking the law, they are going to make it right, but a lot of town cops . . . allow certain folks to do this and do that, and then certain other folks can't do thesame thing.\" An African American citizen speaking of he r white neighbor driving through the neighborhood speed trap: \"We meet the city cop, he throws up the hand, she throws up the hand, she continues to go, I feel like I need to break my speed.\" This last comment leads us to white citizens' assessment of differences among law enforcement agencies. Generally, there is agreement between whites and African Americanshere. Both groups express the opinion that NCSHP is more likely to treat one in a formal manner(that is, stop and ticket), while local police are more likely to be idiosyncratic in their policyenforcement. Whites see an advantage with local police in comparison to NCSHP, and thisadvantage is the result of familiarity between the police and citizenry. 359Issue Three: Police Stops and Fairness African American citizens reported a remarkable willingness to take responsibility for their actions. Especially in cases where speeding was the infraction triggering the stop, thesecitizens reported that the stop was fair. Still, there was a serious concern about the treatment afterthe stop. Here issues of respect and understanding surfaced. Citizens reported confronting suchquestions as \"Do you live around here?\" and \"Is this your car?\" It should not be surprising that,even when a citizen is knowingly in the wrong, such questions will tarnish future interactionsbetween citizens and police. The situation is magnified when the stop itself is illegitimate, asreflected in the following: \"I see him (the officer) just looking around my car and what not, and he said, 'You know the reason why I pulled you over, don't you?' He said, 'Your tag hasSeptember '98 on it.' I said, 'It's only May.' He was like, 'That's right. My fault.' He gave me my driver's license and registration back and said, 'You don't have anyguns in the car do you?' I said, 'No, it's at home with the dope.'\" Another encounter was the result of mistaken identity. A young man and his brother had the misfortune of being in the general vicinity of a search. The two brothers were stopped, tackled, searched, and detained without ever being told the reason for the encounter. Walk back towards the front of my car. He told me to walk backwards. With my hands in the air. I walked backwards about five steps. They stopped me there andtold me to lift up my shirt and turn around so that they could see that I didn't haveanything in my waist. I did that. I took three more steps back and that's when I wastackled. I don't know how many of 'em grabbed me but I felt at least four of 'em. One on each hand, you know, somebody grabbed me around my neck and theyhandcuffed me and had me down, patted me down. I was asking, what did I do? What's going on? He said, just don't say anything just be quiet. We'll tell you later. Just stand up and get in the back of the car. And, okay, all right. They put me in theback of the car. Did the same thing to my brother except they only let him stand upout of the car and when faced forward, a whole bunch of them just ran over towardshim and tackled him into the grass. They held both of us for ten minutes and wewere sitting in the back of the car. They searched my car, they opened trunk, went through everything in the car. Nobody told me why they were stopping me. Nobodytold me what was happening, my license disappeared for three days. I don't know360who took it. One of the officers took my wallet and my license was taken out of my wallet. My wallet was given back to me but whoever took my license got in their carand left with it. I got it back in the mail three days later. I don't know where itwent. I don't know who took it and don't know why it was taken. \" No whites reported this type of treatment, although whites did note that police do sometimes single out drivers. We heard of \"d riving while blond\" and being stopped for \"driving a flashy car.\" The point here is that the stop experiences that whites shared were specific tothemselves and, except in very general terms, were not shared by others. Interestingly, whilewhite drivers do not report pretextual stops, they were much more likely than African Americansto display a sense of entitlement and even resentment when they were stopped. \"Sure I was speeding, but they should have cut me a break.\" Or the often standard \"Why are theystopping me when they could be doing something useful?\" Issue Four: Targeting African American Drivers? (African American Citizens) Who Gets Targeted by the Police (White Citizens) A majority of African Americans reported that, other than race itself, police are more likely to stop them due to the presumption of \"black criminality\" and physical stereotyping. It isexpected that police are more likely to target African Americans whose dress is less conventional,who drive cars deemed to be linked to criminal activity, and who have hair that is counter to the\"norm\" (dread locks, for example). African American participants recognize that criminalstereotyping is predictive of disparate treatment. This recognition heightens the sense of unfair treatment of African Americans by the police. Additionally, there is a presumption by theparticipants that African Americans are less likely to challenge what they know to be unfairtreatment by the police. A lengthy court challenge to an unfair ticket, in the long run, may bemore costly in time and money then the actual cost of the ticket. 361\"Most of the time, we don't fight it, we don't complain, we just pay it.\" \"Blacks are less likely to complain, have less resources with which to get things done.\" For whites, police are seen as on the lookout for teens, certain types of vehicles, types of individuals \"likely to commit a crime,\" persons who \"don't fit the car.\" While such stereotypesmight suggest a clear racial bias on their face, participants were just as likely to suggest thatyoung and male, regardless of race, would be enough to trigger disparate treatment. For example,one subject noted: \"I think all young males\u2014I think if you see a young male in a fancy sports car with all of the gadgets and the radio is loud, I don't think they would care if he were black or white, they would pull him. \" After some recognition that young African Americans, in particular, might be more likely thanwhites to be stopped, especially if they were somehow \"out of place\" (neighborhood, type of car)whites wanted to discuss how racial discrimination could go both ways. \"I think is exists, but I think it exists on the other side too.\" \"A black police officer pulling a white guy.\"\"I mean, you see it in your workplace. It is the same thing.\" Whites seemed more comfortable with targeting and profiling when it could be expressed as affecting both whites and African Americans. In sum, whites know about \"driving whileblack\" from media accounts, but they don't think that the extent of the problem is as great as it isportrayed. Indeed, whites tended to not be particularly sympathetic to African American driverswho were being targeted by police on the basis of race. They suggested that police were stopping African Americans for good reasons such as drugs or violence. Their examples were notconnected to driving at all, suggesting a disqui eting generalization from one realm of experience362to another. We end this section with one of the most extreme positions noted in the white focus groups: \"They can ride around all times of the day or night, they don't bother to have job any where, but they keep gas in the car, so you have got to suspect that they have got something going on in order to keep the car full of gas and on the road.\" Conclusions The issues surrounding racial profiling by police are complex. One pattern is revealed through the examination of official police stop statistics. We suspect that often a very differentpattern will appear when actions are viewed thr ough the eyes of police, and also of drivers. While generalizations based upon a small number of interviews should be cautiously avoided, theinformation we do have suggests that, although African American and white drivers may agree inprinciple that profiling\u2014even racial profiling\u2014exist s, they do not agree on what it is or on what are its benefits or consequences. While disagreements on all of the issues were found within eachof the focus groups, the strongest differences were found to be between the two races when thegroups were examined collectively. Our focus groups with African American drivers revealed a generally positive evaluation of the job that the police do. Participants were quick to say that the police had an important andtough job and that they were grateful for the good work they do. At the very same time, however,many of the African American drivers had very little trust in individual police officers. They feltthemselves to be at risk of harassment and bias based on race, and they made considered analyticdistinctions for each and every time they were stopped. Some stops were judged fair\u2014typicallywhen they realized or admitted that they had broken a law and they were subsequently treatedwith respect. In general, African Americans in the groups described law enforcement as aninstitution as legitimate and reasonable, yet conversely, they described individual police as363suspect. They attributed racial bias to \"bad apples.\" There was, however, some disagreement among African Americans as to how common the bad apples are. Stops that were not tied to serious illegal driving behavior\u2014the most common was the \"rolling stop\" pull-over\u2014were treated as likely instances of racial bias. In many of these casesAfrican Americans assumed race was the cause of the stop, because they did not recognize anyother legitimate reason. In some cases this assumption was confirmed by the police officer, suchas when reporting that the African American citizen was stopped for being in the wrong\u2014or, inother words, white\u2014neighborhood (and thus out of place). One young man spoke of the time hewas stopped (with his brother), removed from the car, tackled, and had guns drawn on him for driving in a neighborhood where another African Am erican man on foot was being pursued by the police. Here, apparently, \"young, black male on foot\" was interpreted as \"black male anywhere.\" Lack of respect by the police during legitimate stops were also evaluated by some African American drivers as likely instance of racial bias. Lack of respect in the interaction wasinterpreted as an indicator of racial bias, and encouraged the suspicion that the pull-over wasracially motivated as well. Troopers of the NCSHP, in contrast to officers attached to variouslocal police forces, were singled out as treating drivers professionally and with respect. A clear pattern emerged in the focus groups, revealing that African American drivers were less suspicious of the NCSHP than they were of other police officers. While this evaluation mirrors our findings in the citizen survey (that racial disparity in police stops is lower among theNCSHP than among other law enforcement agencies in North Carolina) the focus groupparticipants used respectful treatment, rather than the rate of stops, as the basis for arguing thatthe NCSHP was better. 364In general, African Americans were more likely to perceive racial bias in a stop if the officer interacted with them in a disrespectful manner or they were stopped without what theybelieved to be a legitimate driving infraction. They seemed to be more than willing toacknowledge their responsibility for a \"real\" violation. Minor violations created a differentperception of teh possibility of racial bias. In these cases, African Americans saw race as thepredictor of the stop, not the violation. This is in contrast with white drivers who tended to seeall stops\u2014legitimate or minor\u2014as discretionary and idiosyncratic. White drivers talked about\"driving while blond\" or \"driving while a musician\" or \"he should have cut me a break.\" In manyways, white drivers evaluated the police more harshly than African American drivers did andwere also more likely to generalize \"unnecessary\" enforcement across agencies. AfricanAmerican drivers saw many stops as legitimate and some as potentially racially biased. Whitedrivers saw most stops as illegitimate, but idiosyncratic. We also found stark contrasts between African American and white drivers in evaluations of the \"driving while black\" phenomenon. African Americans tended to see it as just anotherexample of racial bias. Racial bias in the polici ng of drivers was seen as a form of discrimination similar to the other forms of discrimination faced each day. Its existence was confirmed by somecombination of their own experiences, stories th ey had heard from friends and family, media reports on police bias (Rodney King was often mentioned), and the existence of general levels ofprejudice and discrimination in the society at large. White descriptions were considerably simpler and more disturbing. The white focus groups tended to accept that police targeted African American drivers, but described racialtargeting as at least understandable if not fair and justifiable. Since African Americans were stereotypically assumed to be more dangerous and thus more culpable, white citizens typically365saw police stops on the basis of race as reasonable. Whites tended to use stereotypes and statistical discrimination arguments similar to those sometimes used by police to justify racialtargeting. It seemed very easy for the white subjects to collectively justify discrimination inpolicing, even though they were quite resistant to taking personal responsibility for their ownpolice stops. As such, disgruntled white drivers are no natural allies for African American driverswho fear they are being harassed because of their race. 366Appendix G: General Issues in Measurement Before we began the data analysis of the stop, citation, and written warning records, we found that it was necessary for us to evaluate various aspects of the quality of the data themselves. We argue below that the stop data are less complete than the citation and written warning data,and thus much of our subsequent analysis centers on the latter data sets. The primary problem isthat we cannot distinguish between citations issued at checkpoints from citations issued as a result of an officer stopping a vehicle in routine patro lling (the data set does not have a variable that allows us to make this distinction). We will also describe data on accidents, as well asobservational data on speeders (details of which are in Appendix A). The Stop Data Beginning in January of 2000 the NCSHP was required to record every vehicular stop that its troopers made. The stop information is recorded on a form, (the \"stop form\") and then enteredinto a data base. These data seem particularly valuable because they are unique in providing uswith information about police-citizen contacts that were previously unavailable to researchers: stops that do not result in citations or written warnings. These types of stops are of interestbecause they may be argued to be \"pre-textual\" stops - stops initiated as a pretext for the trooperto ask questions, possibly leading to a search of the vehicle. The data allow us to test thehypothesis that African Americans are stopped and given \"no action\" or only a \"verbal warning\" more than whites. Thus, the stop data provide us with further measures of the troopers' behaviorsand thus better enable us to grasp the entirety of police interaction with citizens.367Unfortunately, the value of the stop data can only be evaluated in conjunction with citation and written warning records, so as to determine if the stop records are generally beingcompleted as often as they should be. There are no stop forms completed at checkpoint stops(stops where all or random vehicles are pulled over) and thus we cannot evaluate fully whether allthe stop forms that should be completed are being completed. We came to the conclusion thatthere are too few stops relative to the number of written warnings and citation records to warrantstudy of the stop records as a stand-alone data base (at least relative to the goals of the presentresearch). Stated another way, the evidence suggests that the troopers are filling out the necessaryforms to provide supervisors and researchers with a track record of their transactions withcitizens, but sometimes the stop forms are missing, either because they are not being completed(the form is not filled out) or at least they are not being entered (someone fails to enter thecompleted form into the data base) or because they are not required (checkpoint stop). Weestimate that in up to a third of the situations in which we think that stop forms should be filledout and entered into the data base, they are not being completed or entered into the data basewhen citation and written record forms for the same incidents are being recorded. There areseveral possible reasons for the under-recording of stop records. For one, as stated above, we donot know how many checkpoint stops there are. Two, there could be confusion as to whatconstitutes a stop (see discussion below). In addition, unlike the data collecting/entry process forcitations and for written warnings, the data processing procedure for stop forms does not include,as far as we are aware, standard data quality checking procedures, such as ascertaining that all thestop forms are processed. It appears that often troopers fill out written warning forms, capturing the race of the driver, but fail to reproduce the information on the accompanying stop form. While written warnings certainly provides a \"paper trail\" related to the stop, it makes it52 For example, it would be useful to match records of the same incident across stop and citation data bases, or across stop and written warning data bases.53 We initially hypothesized that in the first few months data were missing because troopers were learninghow to fill out the new stop forms. We examined the data by month and find no trend in the \"missing\"data. Also, it should me mentioned that when the stop da ta were sent to us we verified that the number of records received equaled the number of records sent, so we did not lose the data by data processingmistakes. 368sometimes impossible for the researchers to verify that a stop record indicating that a written warning was issued, and a written warning record of a similar event are actually records of thesame event. This complicates the research effort, as considerable data processing and verificationis necessary to evaluate the quality of the data that are analyzed. 52 As mentioned above, ambiguities of what constitutes a stop may also play a role in reducing the number of stop forms filed. Stop forms are to be filled out when a trooper initiatesand completes a stop of a motor vehicle. Thus, stop forms are not filled out when a trooper iscalled to the scene of an accident (or witnesses an accident) or at a checkpoint stop. Nor is a stopform filled out when a driver is already stopped for some other reason such as vehiculardysfunction or rest. In such cases written warnings and citations would not normally result in acorresponding stop form. Unclear is the situation when a citizen calls in a report of anotherdriver's behavior, resulting in a dispatch call to a trooper and a subsequent stop of a driver, sincethe stop was actually initiated by a citizen. Also, reports from a citizen-band radio, resulting in adriver being stopped should be considered a stop, but may not always be defined as such. We do not know why the stop forms are not always filled out, but we do have evidence that they oftenare not. 53 Although NCSHP troopers are instructed to fill out a stop form every time they initiate a stop, it is not entirely surprising that the form is not filled out when one considers that the data are369largely redundant with information - including race -- already included on other forms. Thus, if a trooper failed to file a stop form at a stop, yet issued a citation or written warning, a record of theevent was placed on file and subject to our review. A \"paper trail\" exists. The trooper may thinkthat filing a separate stop form is unnecessary because presumably researchers or supervisorsshould be able to \"figure out\" who was stopped by examining all the data files potentiallyrelevant to his or her stop (the citation, written wa rning or search files). This assumption would hold if all of the information collected on a stop form were collected on each of the other types offorms (such as written warning and citation forms). Unfortunately for researchers, not all theinformation on the stop form is contained on these other forms. Written warning records, forexample, omit age of driver, time of day, and the area of a county in which the written warningwas issued. Also, the quality of the stop form data themselves is deficient in other ways. Forexample, information is not recorded as to the sub-area of a county in which the stop occurred. Thus, the stop data are not useful for defining a unit of aggregation (a unit of analysis) that weelsewhere argue is valuable - the highway area (s tretch of highway within an area of a county (roughly a fourth of a county in size). It would be useful to know whether the failure to record a stop record in the data base is systematic or random across district or across offi cers. To evaluate that question is surprisingly difficult because there is no identification number linking a stop form to either a written warningrecord or a citation record. Thus, some matching criteria, such as the demographic characteristicsof the driver, time of day, etc., are necessary to match stops with citations or written warnings. To link stop forms that indicate a written warning was issued with written warning files, weinitially thought that matching criteria such as the following would allow for accurate matching: the district in which the written warning wa s issued (fifty-three districts), the trooper370identification number indicating who the trooper is issuing the written warning or filling out the stop form, the month and day of the week, the race and gender of the driver, and some generalinformation about the nature of the charge. However, we found that there were too manyinconsistencies in the definitions of these criteria across data sets. For example, type of behaviorresulting in a stop or written warning is coded differently in the two data bases so that it isdifficult to determine clearly the \"reason for the stop\" and resulting written warning for anyoffense other than speeding, equipment violati on, or for a license/registration irregularity. Moreover, the reason for a stop may not be the same as the reason for the written warning: thetrooper may have stopped the vehicle for speeding but issued a written warning because theinspection sticker had expired (dropping the speeding charge altogether). As researchers, we must be able to distinguish a citation record which has had a stop record filed from a citation record which does not have a stop record filed in order to knowprecisely how many stops a trooper made. If the researcher cannot distinguish stop and citationrecords precisely then we can only estimate how many stops were made by the NCSHP. In thepresent context this means that fairly liberal matching criteria must be used to achieve a matchacross data bases. As it turned out, we can only match records by date, district, trooper andgender of person stopped, warned or cited. (Using more criteria results in very few matches.) Formatching purposes we cannot distinguish between r ecords of people of different ages or races, because age is not recorded across record types and race is problematic regarding the definition ofHispanics (and by implication whites - see discussion below). Because the matching criteria areliberal, there will be \"false positive\" matches \u2014 some of the matched stop and written warning(or citation) records may not involve the same actual event. As just stated, we used liberal criteriathat defined two records as matched if they have the same codes for district, trooper, day, and sex371of driver. Thus, if a trooper issues several written warnings in the same district on the same day to several males, we cannot be sure which specific stop record information on which malesstopped and warned (in written form) by the same trooper on the same day matches correctly witha written warning record. Despite this limitation (which we think is minor relative to our primaryanalysis goals), the data do provide us with an estimate of how many records do not matchbetween the data bases. For example, some stop records will not have a corresponding writtenwarning record and some written warning records will not have a stop record indicating a writtenwarning that we can match. To get an idea of the completeness of the stop data by themselves, examine Table G.1 below. Here there is a breakdown of the number of stops by the actions taken by the NCSHPtrooper at the stop. Also included is the number of non-accident citations and written warnings asrecorded in the respective data bases (that is all the citations issued at non-accident encounterswith drivers, and all written warnings issued.) As can be seen, there are substantially morecitations and written warnings recorded at non-accident interactions between police and citizensthan are recorded on stop records. Of course some of these citations and written warnings areissued at checkpoints stops, which do not require that a stop form be filled out. One possibility that could account for the discord is that troopers do not consistently fill out the stop data forms. This is possible, perhaps, as suggested earlier, because the forms arelargely redundant with the data that must be recorded on what are perceived by troopers to be\"more important\" forms - the citation and written warning forms. Conversations with NCSHPtroopers in our focus groups suggest that not all troopers give high priority to completing the formimmediately following the stop or submitting the stop forms for data entry daily. For example,one trooper reported that he fills out the forms only at the end of the week or when he has enough54 This is actually a conservative percentage because we do not have available information on the actual number of arrests (only the arrests recorded on the stop forms). Toattain as complete a list of matches as possible we include arrests at a stop with the citationsbecause a citation has been filed. Troopers would indicate on a stop form that the most seriousintervention that occurred was a arrest, and not a citation. 372time, and does so by copying the information from their citation and written warning forms. As a consequence of this practice, stops not resulting in a citation or written warning may beoverlooked or forgotten. We estimate that there is a substantial percentage of the stop forms thatare not filed. Despite the missing stop forms, some unique information is collected on these forms, making them valuable. Some of the stop forms record \"no action\" and the \"verbal warning\" actions taken by the trooper. These two forms of action, however, represent only 2.4 percent of all the stop records. Approximately 26 percent of the stops resulting in citations and /or arrests in calender year 2000 do not seem to result in a stop record being filed. 54 More prevalent is the failure to report written warnings on the stop records, where 55.6 percent of the written warningrecords have no stop record equivalent. The relatively high rate of missing stop records forwritten warnings partially corroborates the hypothe sis that the troopers do not take filling out or filing the stop forms as seriously as they might, since the written warning outcome wouldgenerally be regarded by troopers as a less serious type of intervention than a citation. (that is, wewould hypothesize that the less the intervention is consequential for the driver, the less likely thestop form will be filled out.) Because of the missing records, we are reluctant to 373Table G.1 Comparison of Number of Stops to Number of Citation Events and Written Warnings Action Taken by Trooper at StopNumber of Stops Resulting in ActionTakenPercent of Records\"Missing\"(percent ofknown events notin stop data base) Events Known (Non- Accident) fromOriginating Data Base Citations (& Arrests) 440,098 (including 11,815 arrests)25.8 593132 No action 3000 -- Warning 10366 -- --Written Warning 109550 55.9 248296 try to interpret any patterns with the stop data as a \"stand alone\" data base because it would appear that stops are occurring that are not being entered into the data base. Despite the fact that most of the information on stop records is redundant with information recorded on other records, it is lack of redundancy that has been responsible for most of ourresearch concerns. One of our research goals is to verify that the official records of writtenwarnings and citations are reasonably complete in the sense that the forms that are filled out areentered to the data base. To determine the extent that forms are being filed, we attempt to matchstop records to both the written warning and citation files. We were concerned that not all of thestop forms were being filled out, but we were also concerned that not all of the written warningand citation information was being filled out or processed. To assess the prevalence of missingwritten warning and citation records, we initially matched stop records to written warning andcitation records. The matching process was made difficult, however, because the forms differ55 By separate variable we mean that there is a separate question as to whether the driver is Hispanic or not. Where there is, a separate variable is to be distinguished from the situationwhere Hispanic is a category among several others such as \"African American\" or \"white\". Presumably in the former situation more Hispanics would be counted than in the latter situation,where some of the Hispanics would be classifi ed as white or African American instead of Hispanic. 374somewhat in the categories of information recorded, making the match rate less than perfect. On the stop form, for example, race and ethnicity are recorded as separate variables, while on thewritten warning and citation forms, race and ethnicity are recorded as one variable (called\"race\"). This difference is a source of discrepa ncy between the different record types. For example, all else equal, it is likely that more Hispanics will be recorded as Hispanic on a formthat has a separate variable designating Hispanics than on a form that does not have a separatevariable for Hispanics. Before continuing our discussion of the possibility of missing writtenwarning and citation records, we will discuss our concerns about the measurement of who isHispanic in the various official record files. 55 Measurement and Classification of Hispanic Drivers On the citation and written warning records, which have no special variable to indicate whether the driver is Hispanic, 5.3 and 3.3 percent of the records, respectively, (see Table G.2)indicate an Hispanic driver, compared to the stop records, which indicate that 5.4 percent of those stopped are Hispanic (5.6 percent of those getting citations and 3.5 percent of those getting 375Table G.2 Type of Form and Measurement of Hispanic Drivers Stop Form Racial Catgegories: White, African American, Indian, Asian, OtherHispanic is not a race option Written Warning Form Racial Categories: White, African American, Hispanic , Indian, Other, Unknown/Uncertain 3.3 percent Hispanic Citation Form Racial Categories: White, African American, Hispanic , Indian, Other, Unknown/Uncertain5.3 percent Hispanic Stop Form with Written Warning as the TrooperActionDriver's Ethnicity: Hispanic, Not Hispanic 3.5 percent Hispanic Stop Form With Citation as the Trooper ActionDriver's Ethnicity: Hispanic, Not Hispanic 5.6 percent Hispanic written warnings). While the similarity in the findings of these two data sets might lead one to believe that the definition of who is an Hispanic is similar in both the stop records and the writtenwarning and citation records, we do not know whic h specific individuals are coded as \"Hispanic\" on a stop record and on a written warning or citation record because there is no common identifier to link the records. We only know that in the aggregate the percentages are only slightly different (3.3 versus 3.5 percent and 5.3 versus 5.6 percent in the table above). In general, we are doubtful about the accuracy of the coding of Hispanics. In comparing N.C. Division of Motor Vehicle data on Hispanics to citation data, our analysis revealed that 21.6 percent of the NCSHP-defined Hispanics cite d by the NCSHP in 2000 did not have Hispanic listed with the DMV as their \"race.\" Thus, it is possible that NCSHP troopers over-identify376people as Hispanic or the DMV under-identifies them, or that some Hispanics choose to identify themselves as white or other. At the same time, of those drivers identified as Hispanic by theDMV and differently identified by the NCSHP, we find that only .1 percent are identified as\"White,\" less than .1 percent as \"African American,\" while .6 percent are classified as \"other\" bythe NCSHP. Thus, relative to the standard of racial/ethnicity identification used by the DMV, NCSHP troopers tend to \"over-identify\" drivers as Hispanic and only rarely \"under-identify\"Hispanics as some other race or ethnicity (most often here as white). We are especially doubtful about the accuracy of the coding of Hispanics on forms that do not provide for an Hispanic ethnicity classifica tion (the written warning and citation forms). On the stop forms, which have an Hispanic ethnicity category, the race of 89.5 percent of thoseHispanics is coded as 'U' (unknown/uncertain), with 9.3 percent of Hispanics defined as white(the remaining 1.2 percent are coded as Asian, Afri can American, or Indian). Only 1.1 percent of the written warning records are of 'U' drivers (another 3.3 percent are explicitly coded Hispanic)and 3.3 percent of citations are to 'U' or 'O' dr ivers (unknown/uncertain or other), with another 5.3 percent listed as Hispanic race. In other words, Hispanics are not generally coded as being ofthe white race on the stop form, but rather are \"unknown/uncertain,\" while on the citation andwritten warning forms, Hispanics are coded as Hispanic for race, with some unknown number ofthem likely coded as white (we could only know for sure if we had an identification numbermatching stop and written warning or citation records, such as the stop identification number. Such a number exists, but it is not linked to the written warning or citation records). There is variation on the stop form in the cl assification of Hispanics as 'unknown or other' versus white (recall there is no Hispanic code for race on the stop form). Only 84.5 percent of theHispanics on the stop form with a written warning action are coded as \"unknown\" race, compared56 A substantial proportion of the 'unknowns' who have citation records according to the stop data are not Hispanic (21.6 percent), Si milarly, 25.4 percent of the 'unknown/uncertain' category for written warnings are not Hispanic, so we cannot assume that all\"unknown/uncertain\" classifications on the written warning and citation records are actuallyHispanic. It is possible that none are Hispanic since the trooper has a race category option forHispanic, which is presumably the most likely category chosen by the trooper for someone whoappears to be Hispanic. 377to 90.2 percent of the Hispanics on the stop forms with a citation action. The roughly 5 percent difference is substantial, indicating that it is likely that there is some doubt in the troopers' mindsas to how to code Hispanics as far as a racial category (are Hispanics \"white\" or\"unknown/other?\"). The possibility exists that a trooper might define an Hispanic as \"white\" onthe stop form, but as \"Hispanic\" on the written warning or citation form (typically filled outwithin a few minutes of the stop form). We do not have a ready way to verify how often troopersvary their classification of the race of Hispanics from one form to the next (for example, stop form to citation form) at the same stop incident. 56 The fact that 9.3 percent of Hispanics (defined so under the NCSHP ethnicity classification) ar e coded as whites instead of \"unknown/uncertain\" makes the percentage of Hispanics in the citation and written warning data bases dubious. Inshort, it is unlikely that we will be able to identify the number of Hispanics \"mis-classified\" as 57 A modification of the original legislation required that an identification number be used by each trooper on the stop form after July, 2000, but that \"outside\" persons would not haveaccess to this number. This was interpreted by the NCSHP representatives to mean that we, asresearchers, should not have access to any identification number, even one without anaccompanying list of names. This is not an unreasonable interpretation by the representativessince we as researchers have information on approximately 97 percent of the stops made by theNCSHP from August through December of 2000 that could in principle result in theidentification of a trooper. Specifically, knowing the time of day and location of the citation and written warning records, we could make a reasonably accurate estimate of who the trooper waswho was involved in a stop. As it stands, however, we do not know whether the same trooperwas involved in any two stops for the August through December data because no identificationnumber of any kind was provided to us. The troopers' identities are known to us, however, forthe months of January through July, 2000. 378whites in the present data. At the same time, it seems likely that a small proportion\u2014but a non- trivial number\u2014 of whites in the citation and written warning records are mis-classified andshould be defined as Hispanics. Missing Stop Records by District The error associated with the classification of a driver as Hispanic also makes it less likely that we will be able to match all of the stop records unequivocally with the citation or writtenwarning records. Our primary motive for doing so is to ascertain that any missing records (fromthe citation or written warning data bases) include a disproportionate number of AfricanAmericans. In some initial data analysis we attempted to determine how many stop records were\"missing\" by comparing to all the stop records for the months January through July, of calenderyear 2000. (Since we only have trooper identification information for those seven months, theyare the only months worth considering for matching purposes.) 57 However, we found that we could not match a fairly large proportion of cases between the stop and the citation and/or written 379Table G.3 \"Missing\" Stop Records (Comparing non-Accident Citations and all Written Warnings to the Number of Stop Records Resulting in Citation or Written Warning) District Written Warnings and Citation EventsStops for Written Warnings or CitationsProportion of Written Warnings and Cites \"Missing\" 1 18311 11,504 .372 2 11886 5,440 0.542District Written Warnings and Citation EventsStops for Written Warnings or CitationsProportion of Written Warnings and Cites \"Missing\" 28 11172 0.16858 Troopers were mailed an id number that only we, as researchers, knew who had what number. However, we did not have a way to verify how consistently that the numbers werebeing used by every trooper for every stop. Most of the troopers, if not all of them, appeared tobe using a number within a range of numbers that we sent them, but we do not know if theyalways used the correct number. 380warning data bases for the months from April through July. We suspect that the high failure rate is due to the fact that there was no data verification for the identity numbers that we assigned totroopers for April through July. 58 (we, the researchers sent each trooper an identity number to use). Some troopers may not have used the identification number that we provided (althoughmost seemed to), or may have been confused about which number to use (our identificationnumber, their regular identification number) or may have simply forgotten their identificationnumber (we resent identification numbers to several troopers the first month). Others may havebeen careless in recording the correct number. Without basic data verification procedures inplace, the April through July data (when the troopers were supposed to use the identificationnumber that we provided them) are suspect for matching purposes. It is interesting to note that the proportion of \"missing\" written warnings and citations omitted from the stop data base vary considerably across patrol districts (see Table G.3). The factthat the proportion of \"missing\" stop records varies as much as it does from district to district supports the idea that some troopers\u2014 especially in some districts\u2014 are less attentive to fillingout the forms. As best we understand, there are no systematic monitoring procedures in place. Ofcourse, use of checkpoints can also vary across districts, and account for some of the \"missing\" stops. We summed the number of citations and written warnings in each of the fifty-three districts (excluding citations issued at accident s since there is usually no stop associated with381accidents). Across the fifty-three NCSHP distri cts, the average proportion of written warnings and citations \"missing\" is about 29 percent. (In the table, the districts have been arbitrarilyassigned an identification number, so our distri ct number is not the NCSHP district number.) Several districts are missing more than a third of their stop records, and one district is missing an estimated 56 percent of its stop records. The fact that what we estimate to be the proportion of \"missing\" stop records varies considerably across di stricts suggests to us that the lack of standard data verification procedures results in haphazar d reporting of stops in some districts. We doubt that checkpoint citations and written warnings could account for all the \"missing\" stops. To simplify the analysis, in the next section we will focus on only the first three months of data in calender year 2000. Here, troopers were using their regular identification number, thesame number they use on the written warning and citation forms. Thus, there is a greater chancethat the stop records will match with the citation and written warning records. Comparison of Stop Written Warning Actions to Written Warning Records We continue our analysis with a comparison of the stop records indicating that a written warning was issued (the trooper took the action of issuing a written warning) and the actual written-warning records. From January through March, we could identify (locate and match onseveral characteristics) roughly 96 percent of the written warning records when a stop recordindicated that a driver was given a written warn ing. That is, we could successfully find the matching written warning record when the stop record indicated that there should be a writtenwarning record. We matched the stop-written warning to the written warning record informationfor the following variables: district of the st op, identification number of the trooper, month and382day of the stop, and sex of the driver. A considerably higher failure rate was found (in other words, fewer matches) when we added race as a criterion for the match. This supports oursuspicion that the classification of the Hispanics was not as consistent as we\u2014as researchers\u2014 would have liked it to be. The missing 4 percent of written warning records could be due to any number of factors, including the following: the trooper made an error in recording the district number (perhaps thetrooper recorded his/her official district assignm ent number instead of the number of the district in which the event occurred), his or her identification number, the date, or the sex of the driver. In reviewing the records that we could not matc h, we noticed that the dates were often different by a few days. This raises the possibility that the trooper simply forgot the date, entered thewrong date, or that the trooper was filling out the stop form at a later date and simply used thatdate on the form rather than the date of the actual stop. The plausibility of the latter wasreinforced during the focus groups with the troopers, when some troopers indicated that they donot always fill out the stop forms at the time of the stop. Instead, the stop forms are completed ata later date by copying the information from the written warning records onto the stop records. Perhaps when doing so, they use the date the form was completed rather than the correct date ofthe stop (creating a paper trail but one not specific to the actual stop date). One possible data analysis strategy would have been to use the written warning stop records when we could not find the written warning record. However, there are three reasonswhy we did not do this. First, it seems unlikely that the 4 percent missing written warningrecords were really missing (as opposed to not matching). There would be little reason for atrooper to report on the stop form that he or she is issuing a written warning, and then fail to do383so. There is a large surplus of written warning records that do not have matching stop records, and it seems likely that the real matching record is, in fact, somewhere in that pool. Second, theinformation on the stop form regarding written warnings is generally less useful to us becausethere is less information about the location of the event. Thus, these observations would drop outof some of our subsequent analysis in which the location of the event was a variable in the database (they would constitute \"missing\" data for the analysis). Third, there is virtually nodifference in the racial categorization in those records that match versus those that do not matchacross data bases. Specifically, there is only a .1 percent difference in the percent of AfricanAmerican stop-written warning records missing and the percent white stop-written warningrecords missing. Thus, there does not seem to be any bias by race in non-matching stop writtenwarnings. More common than missing written warning records were missing stop records indicating that a written warning had been issued. Approximately 33 percent of the written warning recordsin January through March had no identifiable stop record associated with it (note that this is amuch lower rate of missing stop records than we observed above for the whole year, 56 percent). The 33 percent missing stop records suggests that NCSHP troopers do not always fill out stoprecords when issuing written warnings (or the wr itten warning was issued at a checkpoint stop). From a data analyst's perspective, it is unfortunate that the NCSHP trooper does not always fillout a stop record, but the fact that a written warn ing record was filed by the trooper indicates that a \"paper trail\" exists, and we can evaluate those warnings for possible racial disparity. 384Missing Citation Records In addition to being concerned about written wa rning records that possibly were not being filled out or processed, we were even more concerned about the possibility of missing citationrecords (since citations represent a more severe sanction than written warnings). We weredoubtful that there could be missing citation records (for example, a stop form suggests a citationwas issued, but we cannot locate the specific citation record) because it would seem unlikely thata trooper would not file a citation if he or she had issued one to a driver. Nevertheless, weconducted an analysis similar to that for written warning records, matching records that wereidentical in district, trooper identification, month, day and gender. We were able to match 95percent of the stop records that indicated that a citation was issued. Stated another way, we found that 5 percent of all citation events could be deemed missing by this standard (compared to 4percent of the written warnings discussed above). We think, however, that\u2014similar to theargument above for written warnings\u2014our failure to identify a citation record as a match to a stoprecord indicating that a citation was issued could be attributed to recording errors of any of the data elements used to match records. Nor do we find anything but a trivial difference in the racialbreakdown of this 5 percent of cases. We, theref ore, did not pursue the possibility of generating citation records from the stop records (in other words, creating a citation record because we couldnot find one that we think was issued based on a stop record), but instead proceeded to analyze the citation records as they had been given to us. In summary, our analysis of stop record data indicate that a large number of stop records do not appear to have been filed by NCSHP troopers. However, there does not appear to be anyjustification for a suspicion that significant numbers of written warning and citation records are385also not being filled out or filed by the troopers. At most, 4 percent of the written warnings and 5 percent of the citations could be \"missing,\" but we think it is more likely that we simply cannotidentify the appropriate record. The records exist; we simply cannot identify them from the ratherlarge pool of unmatched records. One thing is certain: a single identifier used across all records would allow both better monitoring of stop reports and assist researchers in the future. Accidents In order to determine if there is any racial disparity in stops, citations, or written warnings, it would be useful to compare the proportion of such interventions involving African American drivers with some baseline measure of African Americans violating traffic laws. In the absenceof measures of such law violating behavior , we look to other sources of information to approximate the measures we lack. We argue that accident reports filed by the NCSHP representa useful baseline for comparison of the percen t of African Americans who have been issued citations and/or written warnings. Here, we initially ask the question whether or not the accidentdata represent a meaningful measure of all the reported vehicular accidents, and whetheraccidents can provide a useful basis for asse ssing who is driving on the highways or who is perhaps driving dangerously on the highways. As for the first concern, in large metropolitan areas it is most often the local police who do the \"paper work\" associated with official records of accidents, and they will not be represented inthe NCSHP accident files. (We do not have access to the local police accident files). Of course,the NCSHP generally do not patrol heavily in metropolitan areas (except for major highways suchas I-85 or I-40), so the exclusion of local accident data may be less relevant to our concerns. That59 We would also have to rule out accident reports being filled out by each county's Sheriff Department. 386is, if the local police process accidents in their primary jurisdiction and the NCSHP processes accidents in theirs\u2014 and there is no overlap, then the NCSHP accident data could be a reasonablycomplete source of information on highway accidents. 59 Unfortunately, we do not have a means to measure jurisdictional patrol overlaps, so there will be some doubt about the completeness ofthe NCSHP accident data for our purposes. Table G.4 shows some correlations between three measures obtained from the Automobile Association of America's (AAA) 1999 data on driv ing miles and accidents in North Carolina, and four measures of accidents from the NCSHP data files (AAA, 2001). The most recent year for which such AAA data are available is 1999, and we assume that the 1999 data would be highlycorrelated with the 2000 data. The first AAA variable is a measure (in thousands) of vehicularmiles traveled per county (here the 100 counties in North Carolina have been aggregated into thefifty-three NCSHP districts). The second measure is the number of collisions per 10,000vehicular-miles-driven. It should be noted that these collisions are for all jurisdictions in NorthCarolina, not only those of the NCSHP. Thus we would expect the correlations between the NCSHP accident data and the data for the whole state to be somewhat attenuated (and they are). The third measure is the number of collisions (again across all jurisdictions), and the fourthmeasure is the ratio of accidents to injuries (included to show that there is variation in the severityor seriousness of accidents relative to driving prevalence). As can be seen in the correlation matrix in Table G.4, there is a very high correlation between the number of collisions and the number of VMT (vehicular miles driven)\u2014 .965. Thus,much of the variation in collisions across districts can be attributed to the sheer volume of traffic. 387The moderately high correlation of collisions per 10,000 VMT with VMT indicates that collisions are more prevalent in high VMT areas independent of the sheer volume of the traffic, suggestive that the density of the traffic may be responsible for the high collision rate, although other safetyrelated factors may be also involved. The NCSHP data base on accidents provides us with a count of the number of accidents per district. It would be expected to correlate more weakly with the VMT because thejurisdictional area of the NCSHP is a subset of a ll the areas within a district (VMT is for the entire area, including the metropolitan areas that are not usually patrolled by NCSHP). Thecorrelation of .585 indicates that there is, nevertheless, a moderately strong correlation betweenthe NCSHPs' count of accidents and the vehicular miles driven. The number of people injured inNCSHP-recorded accidents correlates .632 with VMT and .580 with the number of accidents(.511 with number of collisions). The number of people injured in accidents is not strictly a linear function of the number of accidents. In fact there is much variation in the ratio of accidents to injuries, varying from 1.68 to12.47 with a mean of 5.907 and a standard deviation of 2.94. Generally the ratio is higher wherethere is more traffic and a higher rate of collisions per VMT. One could speculate that the\"fender bender\" type of accident is more prevalent where traffic is heavier. Where traffic isrelatively light, an accident has a higher chance of involving an injury than where the traffic isheavy. As for deaths, there is virtually no correlation between the number of deaths and any ofthe other variables except number of injuries. The number of deaths on NCSHP highways is relatively rare, compared to the traffic volume or number of accidents (the mean number of deathsper district in 2000 is twenty-four). The relative ra rity of highway deaths suggests to us that the388number of deaths is quite random and largely a product of such other considerations (not measured here) as promptness of ambulance service, proximity to hospitals, or highwayengineering factors. Therefore, we conclude from this prelimin ary analysis of the NCSHP accident data that there is a plausible foundation for using such data as a basis for further comparisons. Forexample, we could use the accident data to compare the percent of accidents with African Table G.4 Correlations t except where noted as non-significant (n.s.).389American drivers to the percent of those cited who are African American. We discuss further the validity of using accident data in the section below on the observational baseline study in whichwe observed the race and speed of motorists on fourteen select highway segments. Baseline Observational Study In an attempt to determine if there is variation in the speeding of motorists on highways in North Carolina, we observed the race of passing drivers while ourselves driving at the speed limitand timed the speed of those drivers with stop watches. The details of what we call our baselineobservational study can be found in Appendix A. Of importance here is the fact that we havegathered some data on fourteen highway segments (both directions of traffic for stretches of highway that are 10 to 15 miles in length, one-way), selected because they are areas where theNCSHP stops many vehicles (both white and Afri can American drivers). The observational study is a modification of a method pioneered by Lamber th, but in many ways is unique. For example, we actually measure the speed of the passing vehicles. Also, we measure the location so as tocompare data with stop and citation data from the same or proximate area. Since we were thefirst to attempt this method, there are improvements that could be made to the study\u2014 primarily,that it would have been helpful to have gathered more data at each of the fourteen locations. Atthe time we did the study (May and June, 2000) we did not know as much about speeding andstops of speeders as we know today. The implication of this understanding is that the results fromour baseline observational study are somewhat ambiguous as to the possible presence of racialdisparity in the stops and citations on the fourteen highway segments studied. The method,390however, has been proven useful, in our opinion, to the further study of vehicular driving behavior as well as policing behavior. One of the facts that we learned from the baseline study\u2014after we had collected the data\u2014 is that many highways have different \"speeding thresholds\"\u2014 that is, speeds that arelikely to result in a pullover and citation. Importantly, these speeding thresholds are quite highrelative to our expectations going into the study. These thresholds were roughly twelve to fifteen mph above the posted speed limits, whereas we had expected that seven to nine mph above theposted speed would be likely to trigger a patrol stop and citation. Thus, when we learned that a driver on any of the fourteen highway segments had nearly a zero probability of being cited fordriving seven to nine mph above the speed limit, we were surprised. As a consequence of theseconsiderations, we did not find as many speeder s (threshold speeders) as we thought we were finding when we collected the data. One unfort unate consequence of the high threshold speeding values, is that we cannot conduct a rigorous comparison of the speeding and ticketing of AfricanAmericans in the same geographic areas\u2014 there ar e too few \"real speeders\" (threshold speeders) to do so. However, we will discuss the general pattern of findings below, which indicates that,overall, there are slightly more African Americans stopped and cited for speeding in the fourteenareas than there are African Americans found sp eeding. The differences observed, however, are generally not statistically significant across the sites. In Table G.5 below, we present some of the findings from the observational baseline study of each of the fourteen sites. Note that thes e fourteen sites represent a convenience sample of locations in North Carolina. To be included in the study, a highway segment had to have fourlanes of traffic (for safety reasons\u2014 see disc ussion in Appendix A) and had to be among the60Note that the stop data includes milepost markers as one of the variables, thus allowing us to identify segments of a highway with relatively many stops. It should also be noted that wechecked to see that there were numerous stops of African Americans as well as of whites in thesesegments, although we did not formalize this process by requiring that a certain number orproportion of those stopped be African American. 61 We did not have sufficient data or information about speeding to draw a simple random sample of areas. A simple random samp le of segments of four-lane highways would yield mostly highway segments where there are too few stops or citations to compare statisticallyto the observed speeding. We also did not feel confident that the stop data base had all of thestops (as per the discussion earlier in Chapter Two), so that a rigorous sampling of areas withhigh rates of stops would be inappropriate. The fourteen sites represent fourteen of the top 60 highway areas in the state in terms of number of stops. Most of the areas not selected were two lane highways, or in highly traveled areas around large cities (where we thought it unsafe todrive and collect data on speeders) or too far fr om Raleigh, where our research team was based, such that we could not afford to drive to the site every day for a week. 62 In should also be noted that for the non-Interstate highway segments we generally do not have mile post data, so the location of the stop is only approximate (we know the highway,county and area of the county in which the stop took place, but not exactly the 10 to 15 milesegment of the US or NC highway). It is only for the Interstate highways that we have mile postdata and thus know within one mile where the stop occurred. It should be acknowledged,however, that we have no way to check on the validity of the mile post marker information. If atrooper mis-records the mile post where the stop occurred, we would not have a means of findingsuch an error unless the milepost indicated is in a different police district. 391highways with a high number of citations in the early months of the year 2000. 60 Because the sample is a convenience sample, one should resist the temptation to generalize from our sample offourteen sites to other four-lane highways or highway segments. We do not have a simplerandom sample of locations, so generalizing to other geographic areas would be hazardous. 61 As can be seen in Table G.5 the percent of African Americans who speed is examined relative to two standards. The more conservative standard is the speeding above the median local threshold(defined as the median mph above the posted speed limit from those citations issued in 2000 onthe same highway [for example, I-95] in the same county area [roughly one fourth of a county]). 62 A more liberal threshold value would be the speed at the first decile of the distribution of thosecited (a decile represents 10 percent of the observations, so the first decile represents the speed at392which Table G.5 Various Measures of \"Threshold Speeding\" by Highway Segment, Observational Baseline Study Segment 70 82 22.9 79 14.6 29.4 21.6 I-95-J 65 80 25.4 78 17.6 27.3 27.2I-95-H 70 80 25 79 21.5 33.8 30.9I-85-G 65 80 55.9 79 33.9 40.6 41.5I-85-W 65 80 40 79 22.8 36.8 31.4I-85-V 65 80 47.6 78 34.3 40.5 32.1I-85-RD* 55 & 65 70 & 80 12.5* 69&78 17.7* 25.0* 28.1I-40-J 70 85 15.4 79 14.7 14 15.3I-40-P 70 84 15.2 79 11.6 14.1 15.7US-L 55 70 20 69 22.2 22.0** 28.4US-C 65 80 12.2 77 14.9 19.5** 14.8US-G 55 70 26.6 69 24.8 26.6** 28.3US-N 65 80 42.3 77 31.3 44.9** 35.9NC-G 65 80 21.1 77 10 28.9** 31.6 *Two posted speeds across this highway segment. Construction at site reduced speeding, so N of MTS is very low (16).** = estimates based on the highway of the observational study for the entire area of county. Since there were no mile posts on these highways, it was impossible to identify stops in thehighway segments studied. Estimates of percent African American are generally higher using thecounty area data than using only the highway segment data (by a percentage or two).63 Generally the first decile value and the median value were quite close, so that there is only small differences in the percent African American using the two definitions. That isbecause there seems to be a \"magic\" number for each highway area, and often only one mphdifference between the first decile cut-off point and the median cut-off point, e.g, 14 mph more than posted speed is the first decile value and 15 mph the median value. In other words, 10percent of those cited were cited for traveling 14 mph more than the posted speed, and 50percent (or more) were cited at 15 mph more than the posted speed. This was a common findingacross highway segments. 39310 percent of the vehicles are stopped and cited). Comparing the two threshold speeds indicates that African Americans are somewhat over-repres ented among those who are driving at or above the fifty percentile speeding threshold within the fourteen sites. 63 Note that we do not have available to us the speeds for which drivers are stopped, only the speeds for which drivers areissued tickets. Thus, it would be reasonable to assume that drivers are stopped at speedsgenerally lower than the speeds for which troopers issue citations. Many drivers stopped forspeeding are given written warnings (roughly a thir d), and for those drivers we do not have a recorded speed. Also, we have no direct measure of the risk of being stopped at a given speed, only evidence on the speed information of cited speeders. The table may be read as follows: in highway segment I-95-N, where the speed limit is 70 mph, there is a conservative (or high) estimate of the speed that will result in a stop (82 mph) anda liberal (or low) estimate (79 mph). Half or more drivers are issued citations for speeding at theconservative threshold, and 10 percent or more are cited for speeding at the liberal threshold. (\"Conservative\" here means that we are probably underestimating the risk of being stopped andcited on I-95-N if one is driving 82 mph, and \"liberal\" means we are over-estimating the risk ofbeing stopped and cited if one is driving 79 mph.) The percentage of drivers observed speeding at or above the conservative speeding threshold varies across segments\u2014 from a low of 15.2 in segment I-40-P, to a high of 47.6 in I-39485-V. Using the more liberal speeding threshold measure, we see that the percent of speeders who are African American varies from a low of 10.0 in NC-G, to a high of 34.3 in I-85-V. Theseresults are both interesting and disappointing. We probably are measuring the speed of vehicles accurately within (plus or minus) 2 mph\u2014 see discussion in Appendix A. Yet, the differencebetween our conservative and liberal estimate of threshold speed is between 1 and 3 mph. Thedifference that a couple of miles per hour makes in terms of the risk of being stopped is quitelarge (for that matter, when using radar equipment to measure speed, there is a margin of errorwithin 1 mile per hour, therefore indicating that there is presumably more error in ourmeasurement of speed than in a trooper's). On most of the highways we studied, as the term\"threshold\" implies, there is a substantial change in risk of being stopped that occurs as oneapproaches speeds of 80 mph. Traveling 77 mph on some highways elevates the risksubstantially; for other highways one needs to be driving 79 mph to incur relatively high risk. By80 mph, the driver's risk is substantial on all but three of the observed highways. On those threehighways, substantial risk does not occur until traveling 82, 84, or 85 mph (I-95-N, I-40-P, I-40-J,respectively). One of the implications of these numbers is that we would have to be measuring speed exactly (within .5 mph) to know precisely what percentage of African Americans we shouldexpect would be stopped for speeding on each of the highway segments. Instead, we can only beapproximate in our estimates. The conservative and liberal criteria initially proposed here suggestthat a percentage of African Americans somewhere between 14.6 and 22.9 percent could beexpected to be stopped for speeding on I-95-N. This is a rather large interval, pointing againtoward the fact that there is some error in measurement that prohibits us from making strong64 This comparison of a highway segment with what we call a highway area is generally comparing a 10 to 15 mile stretch of highway with a longer stretch of highway that includes the 10-15 mile segment. The longer highway we estimate to generally be two to three times longer.Also, it should be noted that we are counting all accidents from 1998 through 2000 in thehighway 395claims as to racial disparity in our baseline observational study. As we will discuss below, however, we think it is even more complicated than that. The table also shows that there is some association between the percentage of drivers in accidents who are African American and the percentage driving above the speeding thresholds(both conservative and liberal). Note that the comparison is imperfect regarding the geographicarea covered. NCSHP accident data do not include mile post data, so we can only compare theobserved speeding behavior within the highway segment with the accident behavior in what wecall the highway area (in other words, all the accidents on the same highway within about aquarter of a county). 64 The actual correlations across the fourteen sites are .793 and .731 between the percentage of drivers in accidents who are Af rican American and the percentage of threshold speeders who are African American (conservative and liberal thresholds, respectively). Omittingthe I-85-RD segment (because of low reliability) raises the correlations somewhat\u2014to .842 and.739 (conservative and liberal thresholds, respectively). These correlations are encouraging in that there are reasonably high correlations between a potential baseline measure (percent of accidents with African American drivers) and measuresof police behavior (percent of citations issued to African Americans). The correlation between the percentage of drivers in accidents who are African American and the percentage stopped for speeding who are African American is .865 (.874 if I-85-RD is omitted). Thus, there is a slightlyhigher correlation between the percentage of African American drivers in accidents and the396percentage stopped for speeding than there is between the percentage of threshold speeders who are African American. Note here that the numbe r of highway segments studied is only fourteen so the correlations are highly susceptible to fluctuations. In any event, there is an empirical basisfor expecting a reasonably strong relationship between accidents and NCSHP intervention in anarea. In our analysis, we looked at the stop records for May through July, 2000, for daytime hours\u2014approximating the hours that we observed speeders (weekdays, 9 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m.to 5 p.m.)\u2014 and found that, for example, 29.4 percent of the drivers stopped for speeding on I-95-N (see table) were African American, a dispar ity in the direction of bias against African Americans. In seven of the fourteen districts, relative to the conservative threshold, disparity inthe direction of hypothesized bias is found, but in five districts there is more speeding observed of African Americans than there are stops of African Americans (one district has unreliable data, and one district is a tie). Using the liberal risk of speed threshold, we find that all but twohighway segments (U.S.-L and I-40-J) have fewer African Americans speeding above the threshold than those who are stopped. It should be noted, however, that we do not know much about the selection process by which troopers decide to pull over vehicles for speeding. For example, it is likely that not everydriver observed speeding at the threshold value gets stopped, but those that speed well above thethreshold values are more likely to be stopped. We would need data on what troopers actuallyobserve to make a better assessment of the real threshold values that trigger stops. Such valuesmay vary with how busy the trooper has been that day, or how long it has been since a trooper has397pulled over someone. It seems likely, however, that the more grievous the speeding violation, the higher the risk of someone being stopped. Figure G.1 Percent of Drivers Speeding Mo re Than the Speeding Thresholds by Race 65 The percent reflects a count of all drivers observed who were African American or white. Drivers judged to be Hispanic or Other are excluded from the computation of the rate. 398In Figure G.1 we show that, across all fourteen highway segments of the observational study, African Americans make up a higher propor tion of the \"threshold speeders\" (up to 30 percent) than they make up of all drivers on the highway (20.2 percent).65 Threshold speeders here is defined three ways: low threshold of speeding (at or above the first decile of speeds atwhich drivers are cited), high threshold speeding (at or above the median at which drivers arecited) and a flat fifteen mph above the posted speed limit. (we added the 15 mph above postedspeed as a threshold because it is a standard used in a New Jersey study\u2014 Lange et al., 2001). For example, we see that African Americans make up approximately 30 percent of those traveling7-8 mph above all three speeding thresholds, while they make up only 20.2 percent of thosetraveling on the highway (the flat reference line at approximately the 20 percent mark on thevertical-axis). We can see that African Americans are over-represented among those who arespeeding above the point at which speeding citations are likely. We can say that this pattern is\"robust\" across definitions of speeding thresholds in the sense that the pattern is the sameregardless of how the thresholds are defined. At the top of the graph are three lines representingthe percent white of the total number of all wh ite and African American drivers. Thus, the percent white represents a complement to the percent African American (the two percentagesmust sum to 100). Note, however, that the proportion African American among the threshold speeders does not rise continually across the speeding values on the horizontal-axis. Thus, the pattern isdissimilar to that shown by researchers in New Jersey. They found that African Americans madeup a progressively higher percentage of the speeders at the higher speeds (Lange et al., 2002). 66 Note that Lange and colleagues present their data only for a speeding threshold of 15 mph above the posted speed limit. They report a continual increase in the percent of speederswho are African American up to 89 mph. We use three different speed threshold measures, andall three show the same pattern: a decline in the percent African American after 7-8 mph aboveall three speeding thresholds. The value of \"11 or more\" mph above the speeding threshold for a15 mph threshold is, of course, equivalent to 26 mph above posted speed (which varies from 55to 70 in our observational study). Thus, the highest speed that could be included in our graph is 96 (70 + 15+11). 399Here, however, we found that the pattern is not a steady incline but rather a curvilinear pattern of initial incline (up to 7-8 mph above the speeding thresholds), and then a decline to where theproportion of threshold speeders who are African American approaches roughly 20 percent (the same percent of drivers observed on the highway who are African American). Note that Langeand colleagues did not present measured speeds above 89 mph, whereas we are presenting speedsup to 96 mph (at least where the speed limit is 70 mph and the speed threshold is 85 mph). Itshould be noted, however, that we do not measure speeds very accurately above 90 mph. 66 Thus, it is possible that the Lange data, if presented for higher speeds, might show a pattern similar toours. 400References for Appendix G AAA Automobile Association of America. 2001.
