What is the role of Aromatherapy? Here in Australia only a minority realise the therapeutic benefits of Aromatherapy and in many instances oils are used purely for their scent in the home or the office. Aromatherapy is the most understated form of therapy and yet its history dates back to 3,500 BC. The Egyptians used Essential Oils as a form of medicine for the healing of wounds, as part of the embalming and mummifying process and for the treatment of many ailments. It is one of the oldest forms of medicine, used extensively throughout the ages. Such is the intensity and versatility of essential oils. The massive resurgence of natural forms of treatment through Naturopaths and Herbalists in all western countries is growing considerably, yet aromatherapy is very rarely on offer as part of the therapy treatment. So there is still a lot of work to do in this industry. Somewhere in the current mix we need Aromatherapy, not as a mainstream form of healing but certainly as a recognised form of therapy working alongside all forms of treatment. Its important to understand the negative effects of heating our oils and the benefits of using oils without heating elements so that we experience our Essential Oils in their purest form. Heating the oils breaks down the components, leaving remnants of their therapeutic qualities, not to mention the added scent and inhalation of carcinogenic properties. The majority of essential oils have a therapeutic quality which consumers need to be aware of prior to use. Yes, the scent is superb, and many consumers use essential oils only for the scent, but pure oils can create an intense reaction as the therapy begins immediately simply by experiencing and inhaling the oils through diffusing, spraying, massaging and adding oils to warm water. In our busy lifestyles, we are constantly juggling so many different components of our lives, and as a result, experiencing so much stress and anxiety. Aromatherapy is one of the simplest forms of therapy. Essential oils can assist with insomnia, stress and anxiety, low energy levels, lack of concentration, building your confidence levels, hormonal imbalances and the list goes on and on and on. Go home and switch on the Diffuser to start the therapy process, or use a massage oil with your favourite oil for stress and anxiety or place a couple of drops in your bath to assist with sleep. Aromatherapy is simple to use, it needs to be a part of our daily routine, it is something that we can do for ourselves with a minimum of fuss and effort. Nurture your soul and live life to "}
