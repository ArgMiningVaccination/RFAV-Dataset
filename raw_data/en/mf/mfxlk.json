If you live in the US, you might think that the end of the tunnel is almost there. [Biden's announcement](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/11/politics/joe-biden-one-year-covid-address/index.html), during his first Address to the Nation, was more optimistic than anticipated: \"if all goes well, the nation could start to be back to normal by the July 4 holiday\". Your views will be largely different, however, if you live in Kenya, where local media has been echoing recent [analysis](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/opinion-analysis/ideas-debate/covid-19-is-here-kenya-must-be-prepared-3327626) estimating that only 30% of the local population will be vaccinated in 2 more years, by the end of 2023. No matter where you live, there are probably more news than one can \"digest\". So here it is my attempt to help...by the way, happy Spring ! [ONE] What is happening with the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout in Europe and why is it that other countries aren't having such a problem? Last [March 10](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-prac-preliminary-view-suggests-no-specific-issue-batch-used-austria), Austrian [national competent authority](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/national-competent-authority) suspended the use of a batch of [AstraZeneca](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca) vaccine after a person was diagnosed with multiple thrombosis and died 10 days after vaccination, and another was hospitalized with pulmonary embolism. On March 11 and following the death of another vaccinated person, Danish Health Authority paused its campaign with AstraZeneca vaccine. The pharmacovigilance system requires for those events to be investigated to establish if the vaccine is the cause. Considering the low frequency of those events and \"its incidence not higher than in normal population\", EMA issued a [communication](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-prac-investigating-cases-thromboembolic-events-vaccines-benefits) recommending to continue the vaccination campaigns while the investigation was finalized. However, numerous countries decided to pause the vaccination as a precautionary measure. On March 18, EMA published the [results of the investigation](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots), supporting its recommendation to continue the vaccination, while acknowledging that \"the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST)\". These are rare cases - 7 cases of blood clots in around 20 million people vaccinated in the UK and EU and 18 cases of CVST. While the causal link with the vaccine is not proven, the EMA communication acknowledges that \"is possible and deserves further analysis\". This potential risk will be included in the vaccine information and EMA is issuing specific guidance to healthcare professionals on this risk. There has been a close collaboration between the UK and EU in this investigation. And while other regulatory bodies across the world where the vaccine is approved haven't yet issued any notice, it's likely that this information might soon be updated. It's important to remember that, unfortunately, there is no product 100% efficacious and 100% safe. As vaccines get rolled out at large scale, additional safety information is gathered. As an example, some large, local, delayed skin reactions have been [noted](https://connect.kff.org/e2t/tc/VXc52d2KRyqjN7tFP5Kd1hzxW3kyKQV4nPKQ_N8SvFG33p_9LV1-WJV7CgBcZW3Zc-6g7Gy9GdW8pMNxS52C1RGW1lJ5VG8lNwZXW2_nlhX6vjLk0W53GbWq5PyRbfW2DjsVb3z7Vy6W7Qdvj-91zXG1W76Y3m42_sYdMW69wMZC93y-tGW1-VvKq71GXBqW52mbvk1Zkh2NW8wdybS2MrvVWW3MX6Qp5MrHVtW7XMZsq5z0Bf_W40KNKh6sTyz9W6X3BJ813YXTKW8jlJPn2jqbhjW1js8gJ8fGNnJW96fFlH2x70GhW2gbgY41zlTgcW6R8Kf18lXT70W1bVHpt1GD8LgW5gY0zt4C3QD0W59zxq688vgSvW1j0V-V1H-pfBW7XHzS_6nS4gCW1zsYhT285cSqW5vcJlM5-2SzW3l701) after Moderna vaccine. And the risk of anaphylactic shock continuous to be monitored for both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, while incidence so far is low, between [2.5-3.8 per million doses](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/covid-19-scan-feb-15-2021?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=111365504&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ykxpLZW_sFS0Ur1B_-y7eMiNPl7Cn1-MS8pbR3GNtmibluddvZLwIL4nb5xyve33NvTiAgeP8-WI1yqyBjGWbKgwPhg&utm_content=111365504&utm_source=hs_email), respectively. [TWO] First-known baby born with COVID antibodies and other encouraging data As we learn more about the approved vaccines, both in term of efficacy and safety, some of the data published is really encouraging. This month, we learnt about the [first-known baby born](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/16/florida-woman-vaccine-dose-baby-covid-coronavirus-antibodies) with COVID antibodies. Her mother had been vaccinated with Moderna vaccine. Also, studies are kicking off to test COVID-19 vaccines in populations not tested before. Including [pregnant women](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-commence-global-clinical-trial-evaluate), and [children and infants](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-phase-23-study-0). Indeed, some recent data shows that [children](https://www.diariomedico.com/medicina/enfermedades-infecciosas/los-ninos-pueden-impulsar-la-transmision-del-sars-cov-2-igual-que-los-adultos.html#:~:text=Un%20estudio%20aporta%20nuevas%20claves,de%20transmisibilidad%20ser%C3%ADa%20m%C3%A1s%20corto.) could spread the disease as much as adults. We also learnt these days that vaccines might benefit the recovery of [long-haulers](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/relief-from-long-haul-symptoms-after-covid-shot-reported-by-some-patients/), offering a silver lining for a significant number of people suffering for months from this chronic condition. Different strategies are also being tested to address the challenge of variants. Pfizer/BioNtech is testing a [third dose](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-initiate-study-part-broad-development) as a potential solution. Moderna has already started the study of a [modified version](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-first-participants-dosed-study-evaluating) of its original vaccine. [Janssen](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-variant-vaccines-in-works-at-johnson-johnson-11616091544) is working on several next-generation versions. We are still collecting information around the duration of the protection, both from natural disease and from vaccination. [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00575-4/fulltext) has recently published the first large-scale study on coronavirus reinfection rates indicating that \"most people who have had COVID-19 are protected from catching it again for at least six months, but elderly patients are more prone to reinfection\". [THREE] The benefits of early vaccination outweigh the risks of waiting for \"a preferred\" vaccine. Once you are lucky enough to get an appointment for a vaccine shot, you won't be given the opportunity to choose which vaccine you are given. Of course, they will inform you and you will have to agree to it, but you will have two options: take it or leave it. And this is happening in every country, as far as we know. For some, the mRNA vaccines are their preferred option because their initial efficacy results are higher (95% for Pfizer/BioNTech and 94.4% Moderna). For some other, the benefits of the \"traditional technology\" of viral vectors exceed the downside of slightly lower initial efficacy in the prevention of disease (66% Janssen, which has the additional benefit of only requiring one dose, and 62,6% AstraZeneca). If you find yourself in the first group, you might be interested in reading this study just [published.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7817395/) The conclusion is clear: \"there are relatively few situations in which it is worth foregoing the first COVID-19 available in favor of a vaccine that becomes available later on the pandemic even if the latter vaccine has a substantially higher efficacy\". [FOUR] Competitor companies are expediting global partnerships to scale-up production, while the outbalance between vaccine demand and supply capacity ignites political tensions As we have discussed in previous articles, the need to supply a vaccine to 7,500 million people globally is an unprecedented challenge. And once again, the key is collaboration. Following the initial public-private partnerships to accelerate the research and development (R&D) programs, the focus is now in building alliances to expedite manufacturing scale-up. The \"winners\" of the vaccine race in the R&D space are now partnering with their \"competitors\" who had less initial luck, and therefore, potentially available manufacturing capacities. And this will hopefully decrease the massive gap between demand and offer. Only in the last few weeks, [Sanofi,](https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2021/2021-02-22-11-40-00-2179318#:~:text=Sanofi%20has%20entered%20into%20an,19%20pandemic%20and%20supply%20needs.) [Merck](https://www.merck.com/news/merck-to-help-produce-johnson-barda-to-provide-merck-with-funding-to-expand-mercks-manufacturing-capacity-for-covid-19-vaccines-and-medicines/#:~:text=The%20Biomedical%20Advanced%20Research%20and,make%20available%20a%20number%20of) and [Catalent](https://www.catalent.com/catalent-news/catalent-expands-partnership-with-johnson-johnson-to-significantly-increase-capacity-for-sterile-manufacturing-and-packaging-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-italy/) have announced partnerships with Janssen; [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-signs-initial-agreement-curevac-manufacture-covid-19-vaccine-candidate#:~:text=Basel%2C%20March%204%2C%202021%20%E2%80%94,against%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic.) with CureVac; and [Pfizer/BioNtech](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biontech-recruits-rivals-to-boost-covid-19-vaccine-production-11615640401) is building a potential alliance of 13 companies. All these are highly positive news which will bear fruits in the following months, increasing the global availably of vaccines. Hopefully, this will decrease the growing political tension between governments. And mitigate the risk of unnecessary actions with negative consequences such as waiving intellectual property rights, as solicited by the [Africa Union](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-africa/african-union-backs-call-to-waive-intellectual-property-rights-on-covid-19-drugs-idUSKBN2AP1CP) and unexpectedly, the [EU](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/covid-vaccines-eu-ursula-von-der-leyen-b1818444.html) itself. [FIVE] Many countries are looking at \"COVID-19 passports\" as a possible way to open-up travel and ease restrictions. However, there is not yet scientific alignment on its use and potential implications. Pressure is growing globally for some sort of validated \"certification\" of individual COVID-19 health status, potentially including vaccination and latest tests demonstrating negative infection and/or positive antibody titers. Scientific leaders are elevating numerous questions around the scientific, ethical, and legal implications which are still to be answered. [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6535/1184) has recently published a very interesting editorial about that. As governments are understandably eager to reignite their economies, it's becoming increasingly obvious that \"COVID-19 passports\" might likely be adopted soon. [Israel](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/03/02/fact-check-israel-launching-green-pass-covid-19-vaccinated/6871965002/) took the lead in the set-up of the so called \"Green Passport\", allowing its vaccinated citizens to benefit from less restrictions. [China](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/17/china-to-allow-foreign-visitors-who-have-had-chinese-made-vaccine) is resuming visa processing for foreigners from dozens of countries, but only if they have been vaccinated with a Chinese-made vaccine. And [Europe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-von-der-leyen/eu-to-propose-vaccine-certificates-in-time-for-summer-holidays-idUSKCN2AT2DN) has communicated that the \"European Digital Green Certificate\" will be set-up \"in time for summer holidays\". ...and this is for now.
