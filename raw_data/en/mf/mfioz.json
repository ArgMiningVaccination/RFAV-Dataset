There are specific muscle energy techniques designed for each region of the [body](/answers/fruiting-body-of-aspergillus). In the [lower limb](/learn/Other_lower_limb_treatments), there are two types of muscle energy treatments: passive and active. Passive lower-limb muscle energy treatment uses the therapist's hands to move the patient's limb into the desired position; whereas in active lower-limb, muscle energy treatment requires the patient to move their own limb.
