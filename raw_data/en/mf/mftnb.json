By 1920, they represented approximately five percent of the profession. But within a decade, their niche in American medicinewomen's medical schools and medical societies, dispensaries for women and children, women's hospitals, and settlement house clinicshad declined. The steady increase of women entering medical schools also halted, a trend not reversed until the 1960s. Yet, as women's traditional niche in the profession disappeared, a vanguard of women doctors slowly opened new paths to professional advancement and public health advocacy. Drawing on rich archival sources and her own extensive interviews with women physicians, Ellen More shows how the Victorian ideal of balance influenced the practice of healing for women doctors in America over the past 150 years. She argues that the history of women practitioners throughout the twentieth century fulfills the expectations constructed within the Victorian culture of professionalism. Restoring the Balance demonstrates that women doctorscollectively and individuallysought to balance the distinctive interests and culture of women against the claims of disinterestedness, scientific objectivity, and specialization of modern medical professionalism. That goal, More writes, reaffirmed by each generation, lies at the heart of her central what does it mean to be a woman physician? In Restoring the Balance, Ellen S. More illustrates the multi-faceted nature of professional womanhood. She focuses specifically on how women physicians have juggled their personal and professional obligations since the mid-nineteenth century. More presents the measures taken by women physicians women \"to reconcile femininity, feminism, and professionalism\" (41). By looking at a variety of women physicians over the span of 150 years. More proves that the need for balance between the personal and the professional leads to a wide spectrum of experience among women physicians as obligations ebb and flow. The central question of More's text asks \"what does it mean to be a woman physician\" (9). More has three main goals: to show how American women physicians fought for professional equality, to reveal how these women resisted the homogenous image of the woman physician by balancing their personal, community, and professional lives, and to note the unique attention that women physicians paid to their patients' psychological, social, and physiological lives. She builds her arguments around a series of short biographical sketches of women physicians throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Although this book is thoroughly researched and well written, there are a few demographics that More fails to fully flush out over the course of her narrative. The vast majority of her sources and conclusions pertain only to the urban, northeastern United States. By ignoring the differences and difficulties between urban and rural populations, More's conclusions seem too tidy and uniform to apply to the experiences of women physicians in rural areas. More also focuses primarily on women who pursued allopathic medicine, discounting the unique experiences of women who practiced homeopathic medicine, midwifery, and alternative medicine. "}
