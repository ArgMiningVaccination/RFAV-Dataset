Trauma can manifest as chronic illness, depression can deplete the spirit, and anxiety can push relationships to their breaking point. These mental health conditions affect every aspect of life, so truly effective trauma treatment must comprehensively address those same aspects. Too often, patients experience the treatment as a series of symptoms rather than a whole individual. This can lead to misdiagnoses, unsustainable results, and a great deal of frustration. Treatment centers that take a holistic approach recognize mental health conditions as biological, physiological, and spiritual conditions. Unfortunately, those who lack this approach view them as a brain-based disease. This comprehensive treatment approach supports lasting wellness and promotes self-care. Which Holistic Services Are Most Beneficial? Each individual's struggles and hopes are unique. A great holistic practitioner will be interested in hearing your personal story before determining whether their services will help you meet your wellness goals. Common holistic services include: - Acupuncture - Massage - Fitness - Nutrition - Yoga - Mindfulness meditation All of these services play different but important roles in recovery. Acupuncture and massage offer relaxation, pain reduction, mood improvement, and enhancement of the body's innate healing abilities. Fitness and nutrition sessions are extremely individualized and allow patients to practice prevention, develop healthy lifestyle habits, and workshop specific concerns surrounding energy, immunity, sleep, mood, etc. Yoga and meditation help cultivate awareness of the mind and body and provide tools to manage stress more effectively. These holistic services can be powerful individually, more so in combination, and even more so when our mental health treatment staff work together to coordinate your care. Holistic vs. Western Medicine For many, the word holistic brings images of yoga mats and herbal remedies only, but in its truest sense, holistic means taking the whole system into account. Western medicine and holistic medicine are often incorrectly depicted as opposing viewpoints. However, a combination of the two typically yields a quicker and more thorough recovery. A broken leg, for instance, merits a visit to the doctor for an X-ray and cast. But eating nourishing food, receiving acupuncture, and practicing meditation may help manage pain, reduce stress, and speed the healing process. The same can be true of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or any mental health condition. Medication (prescribed thoughtfully and only as necessary), psychotherapy, and holistic treatments can complement and balance one another to help you achieve authentic wellness.
