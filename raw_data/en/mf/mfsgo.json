[Amber Finney](https://www.instagram.com/amberthealchemist/), also known as [Amber the Alchemist](https://www.amberthealchemist.com/), is a spiritual practitioner who uses crystals as a central part of her work. She notes that, when it comes to crystals, there's something for every need, whether it's emotional support, confidence, or overall vitality. \"Our ancient ancestors were well aware of the wisdom that could be found through crystals' vibrations,\" Finney says, adding that they were historically a major part of the Kemetic lifestyle (an ancient Egyptian religion and way of life, and the lens through which Finney speaks about crystals in general), particularly in their beauty rituals. \"Goddess Auset (Isis) would go to the river to massage rose quartz on her face\"\u2014long before facial rollers existed. In addition to their usage for beauty benefits, Finney says that crystals were often not only used to identify royalty, but also carved into amulets for protection, and were usually buried in tombstones to support the soul in the afterlife. Finney's passion for healing led her to a career in spiritual work after an eight-year career in the fashion industry. \"Spirituality was the foundation in my home, and I've been called to share my teaching and gifts,\" she says. \"Now, I'm able to merge my love for style, design and spirituality into my work.\" In addition to [her shop](https://www.amberthealchemist.com/conjure), which is filled with healing goods such as Florida Water, Essence Oils, and powerful crystals like Amethyst, Finney is also known for her Instagram page, [@browngirlalchemy](https://www.instagram.com/browngirlalchemy/) which she co-created with her mother \"to reinforce our spiritual lessons, growth and enlightenment.\" They also host a podcast together by the name of [Brown Girl Alchemizing](http://www.browngirlalchemy.com/podcast) where they \"journey though Black womanhood, mysticism, ancestral reverence, wellness, purpose and ascension.\" Soon their joint brand will have merch, which the pair consider \"catalysts for intentional, high vibratory living.\" Below, Finney provides a beginner's guide to crystals: perfect for those who want to brush up on their knowledge, or for those who are stressed at home in quarantine and looking for new ways to practice wellness. The crystals to start with Rose Quartz \"Most people associate rose quartz with romantic love, but it's actually a universal love stone. In order to experience love fully, your heart chakra must be open to it. Rose quartz guides your heart chakra to open up to love\u2014self love, romantic connections, family, etc.\" Black Tourmaline \"Protection is imperative and Black Tourmaline is a go-to stone for protection in all forms. It especially kills low vibrational energy surrounding you and within your energetic body, it's the hater-blocker of the mineral world!\" Amethyst \"Amethyst is a go-to introduction to crystals. Its calming energy isn't overwhelming, but it's noticeable enough to feel its effect on you and your environment. It's great to keep near your bed for a peaceful night's sleep, especially if you have a sleeping disorder or would like your child to have a good night's rest. It's also a great start to connect to your intuition.\" Cleansing your crystals Finney's go-to cleansing methods are smoke (via incense, camphor, or cedar) and salt/salt water. \"You can smudge your crystals by placing them with the smoke while praying to remove any unwanted energies. Salt is historically known for its purifying and detoxifying properties. You can bury your crystals in salt to dispel negative negative energy or submerge them in salt water.\" However, she notes that you should research your crystal before using salt water, as some crystals are soft and can disintegrate. \"Crystals usually ending in -ite should not come in contact with water.\" Cleansing crystals is an important practice \"so that you can clear away the energies that have interacted with them. That way, you are working with the purest form of the crystal without external influences. This makes your ability to connect with them easier.\" In her own shop, Finney cleanses, Reiki charges, and anoints her crystals with her Quartz infused anointing oil, \"so you can immediately cultivate a connection with your crystal allies.\" Charging your crystals Finney recommends crystal charging because the practice \"reenergizes, awakens and activates its natural vibrations. It's not mandatory, but it's extremely helpful!\" You can charge crystals by burying them into the Earth. \"Crystals come directly from the Earth, therefore burying them back into the Earth connects them directly to it's Source.\" You can also charge crystals under sun or moonlight. \"The sunlight charges the crystal with more masculine energy, connected to stability and growth, whereas the moon charges the crystal with it's feminine elements of emotional and intuitive connection.\" Reiki is another form that she uses to charge her crystals as well. \"As a certified Reiki practitioner, I love using the power of my hands to charge the crystals with light energy.\" The best crystals for stressful times Finney has found solace in her wellness practice, especially now amid both a pandemic and a monumental human rights movement. \" Due to our ancestors' sacrifice and efforts we now have the access and flexibility to recommit to our emotional, spiritual, mental and physical bodies,\" Finney says. \"Self-care is an opportunity to reconnect with our history and reclaim our spiritual and wellness space. Through self-care, we not only nurture, but heal our entire bloodline.\" Lepidolite Finney says Lepidolite is an essential right now, \"because all of us are experiencing change, which can make us feel uneasy. It is a stone that aids through times of transition and is amazing for the nervous system, soothing stress and anxiety,\" she says. \"Now is definitely the time to activate our sacral chakra.\" Carnelian Our sacral chakra is the energetic center in our body that connects to our ability to experience pleasure, creativity, and connection to our body,\" making Carnelian another perfect crystal \"to reignite our passion and connect to the things and people that bring us pleasure.\" Bloodstone Finney also recommends Bloodstone to enhance that connection with our genetic bloodlines, as many of us are connecting more and more with our roots and ancestors during this time. Finney's favorites Lapis \"It is my go-to because of the spiritual work that I do daily. I use it for personal divination, but I always wear a Lapis ring when I am doing tarot readings; it allows me to receive divine guidance and provide information more clearly.\" Citrine \"I've used Citrine for years because it's mildly motivating, and I love keeping a mini one in my purse to draw in financial opportunities.\" Ocean Jasper \"This has become a most recent favorites because it reminds to me prioritize my joy and "}
