Information is provided here for reference purposes only. Students completing the master's degree in molecular biotechnology program on a full-time basis generally take two years to complete the 40-credit-hour program. Because of the practicum component of the program, we do not recommend part-time study. By delaying the recommended schedule, you can extend the course of study more than two years. Year 1: Core courses Year 2: Practica (3 semesters) Core Courses To provide a solid foundation, the core curriculum includes biochemistry, molecular genetics, cell structure, cell signaling, research ethics, biotechnology issues, and scientific writing. You'll build practical skills through lecture and laboratory coursework in the theory and application of a broad range of nucleic acid- and protein-based molecular biotechnologies. Practicum Next you'll gain hands-on experience through three semester-long practica during the spring, summer and fall semesters of the second year. Each practicum provides a different molecular biotechnology emphasis (bioscience research, biotechnology industrial applications or molecular diagnostics) and is performed at a different site. During an eight-hours-a-day, Monday-Thursday practicum, you'll work with investigators, laboratory staff and other members to understand the theory and application of state-of-the-art molecular techniques and technologies in depth. Studying at a single practicum site for a full semester allows students to appreciate the day-to-day opportunities, obligations and realities of professionals working in molecular biotechnology settings. Degree Completion A final general examination (written and oral) is required of all degree candidates during the second spring semester. The written component consists of writing a grant proposal and its successful completion is required before taking the comprehensive oral examination of general knowledge of molecular biotechnology concepts and applications.

Please email [healthprofessions@kumc.edu](mailto:healthprofessions@kumc.edu) for information. Vaccines and Clinical Site Requirements The University of Kansas Medical Center requires various immunizations for its students. For a detailed list please visit the [student health forms webpage](/academic-and-student-affairs/departments/student-health-services/forms.html) or speak with Student Health Services. These immunization requirements help promote health and safety and facilitate clinical placement. Many, if not all, clinical sites who partner with the University of Kansas Medical Center require proof of these vaccines for students engaged in training or other programmatic experiences at clinical sites. Not being vaccinated may preclude students from participating in activities, potentially impeding their ability to complete all program requirements for degree completion. Applicants with questions should speak with a representative from the academic program to which they intend to apply. "}
