Get the Vax FactsThere is a lot of information our there about COVID-19 vaccines, and some of it may be confusing. To help clear things up, we're presenting a few simple vaccination facts. \"Effective\" means effective! Vaccines with high \"efficacy rates\" better protect people from become seriously ill with the virus. All three vaccines that are currently being distributed in the U.S. are considered highly effective at preventing COVID-19.

Authorized vaccines do not contain the live virus and cannot give you COVID-19. The three vaccines currently in use are designed to help you body recognize and fight off COVID-19, without the use of a live virus. Learn more about the advanced technology behind the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccines [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html). To be \"fully vaccinated\" takes 2 weeks. The CDC considers people fully vaccinated two weeks after the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. You should continue to take precautions after you have received your vaccines, such as practicing social distancing and wearing a mask. Learn more about guidelines for those fully vaccinated [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html). Herd immunity starts with all of us.
