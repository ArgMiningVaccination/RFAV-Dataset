The purpose of the report is to help the Congress adopt authorizing legislation thatshould be in place before it considers the 13 regular appropriation b ills for fiscal year 1999 (which begins October 1, 1998). Ellen Hays of CBO's Special Studies Division prepared this report under the supervision of Arlene Holen and Marvin Phaup. The author gratefully acknowledgesthe assistance of analysts in CBO's Budget Analysis Division and the budget officesof various agencies, as well as numerous committee staff members. Christian Spoor edited the report, and L. Rae Roy prepared it for publication. June E. O'Neill Director January 15, 1998 OVERVIEW The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to report to the Congress each year onunauthorized appropriations and expiring authorizations. Section 221(b) of that actadded the following requirement to section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budgetand Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended: On or before January 15 of each year, the Director, after consultation with the appropriate committees of the House and the Senate, shall submit tothe Congress a report listing (A) all programs and activities funded duringthe fiscal year ending September 30 of that calendar year for whichauthorizations for appropriations have not been enacted for that fiscal year,and (B) all programs and activities for which no authorizations forappropriations have been enacted for the fiscal year beginning October 1of that calendar year. The conference report on the Deficit Control Act states that the purpose of the requirement is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adoptauthorizing legislation that must be in place before the thirteen regular appropriationbills can be considered.\" Authorization laws have two basic purposes. They establish, continue, or modify federal programs, and they are a prerequisite under House and Senate rules(and sometimes under statute) for the Congress to appropriate budget authority forprograms. Some authorization laws provide spending directly. In fact, well over half of federal spending now goes to programs for which the authorizing legislation itselfcreates budget authority. Such spending is referred to as direct, or mandatory,spending. It includes funding for most major entitlement programs. (Someentitlements are funded in annual appropriation acts, but the amounts provided arecontrolled by the authorization law that established the entitlement.) Theauthorization laws that provide direct spending are typically permanent, but somemajor direct spending programs, such as the Food Stamp program, require periodicrenewal.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 2 Discretionary spending, which is provided in the 13 appropriation acts, now makes up only about one-third of all federal expenditures. For discretionaryspending, the role of the authorizing committees is to enact legislation that serves asthe basis for operating a program and that provides guidance to the AppropriationsCommittees as to an appropriate level of funding for the program. That guidancetypically is expressed in terms of an authorization of appropriations. Suchauthorizations are provided either as specific dollar amounts (definite authorizations)or \"such sums as are necessary\" (indefinite authorizations). In addition, authorizations may be permanent and remain in effect until changed by the Congress, or they may cover only specific fiscal years. Authorizations that arelimited in duration may be annual (pertaining to one fiscal year) or multiyear(pertaining to two, five, or any number of specific fiscal years). When such anauthorization expires, the Congress may choose to extend the life of a program bypassing legislation commonly referred to as a reauthorization. Unless the underlyinglaw expressly prohibits it, the Congress may also extend a program simply byproviding new appropriations. Appropriations made available for a program after itsauthorization has expired are called \"unauthorized appropriations.\" Longstanding rules of the House allow a point of order to be raised against an appropriation that is unauthorized. During initial consideration of a bill in the House(which by precedent originates appropriation b ills), unauthorized appropriations are sometimes dropped from the bill. However, the House Co mmittee on Rules typically grants waivers for unauthorized appropriations that are contained in a conferenceagreement. In the Senate, there is a more limited prohibition against consideringunauthorized appropriations. Both House and Senate rules require that when the Committees on Appropriations report a bill, they list in their respective committee reports anyprograms funded in the bill that lack an authorization. The information in thecommittee reports, however, differs somewhat from the information shown in thisreport. This report covers programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or will expire. Unlike the lists shown in the AppropriationsCommittee reports, this report does not include programs for which the Congress hasnever provided authorizations of appropriations. For example, some TreasuryDepartment programs have never received explicit authorizations of appropriations.They receive appropriations nonetheless b ecause the authority to obligate and spend funds is considered \"organic\" /G26inherent in the underlying legislation or executive action that originally empowered the Treasury to perform particular functions. As mentioned above, many laws establish programs with authorizations of discretionary appropriations that do not expire. Both the Appropriations Committeereports and this CBO report exclude programs with that type of authorization becauseits effect is permanent.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3 The substance of this report consists of two appendixes. Appendix A lists unauthorized appropriations /G26programs that have received an appropriation for fiscal year 1998 although their authorization has expired. Appendix B lists programswhose authorization will expire at the end of the fiscal year. For all appropriatedprograms that at one time had an explicit authorization that has expired or willexpire, the appendixes show the number and name of the public law containing thelast authorization, the last year the authorization was in effect, and the amountauthorized in that year. If the authorization provided for \"such sums as are neces-sary,\" the report shows the amount authorized as \"indefinite.\" This information is drawn from CBO's Legislative Classification System, a database reflecting all public laws enacted that contain temporary authorizations ofappropriations /G26up to and including all laws enacted during the first session of the 105th Congress. PROGRAMS FUNDED IN FISCAL YEAR 1998 WITH EXPIRED AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS Appendix A lists programs and activities that have received a fiscal year 1998 appropriation even though their authorization has expired. If the applicable fiscalyear 1998 appropriation act (or its legislative history) provides an explicit fundinglevel for the program, that amount is shown under \"Unauthorized 1998 Appro-priation.\" If no explicit amount is provided (as when a small program is funded at anunidentified level in a large appropriation account), CBO contacts the agency'sbudget office to determine whether the program is st ill being funded and, if so, the amount allocated for it. If the allocated amount cannot be determined, the appendixnotes that a specific dollar amount of unauthorized 1998 appropriations is notavailable. The Congress appropriated more than $115.8 b illion for fiscal year 1998 for programs and activities with expired authorizations (see Tables 1 and 2). The largestset of such programs is the housing and community development programs of theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. Those programs were lastauthorized for 1994; in 1998, they are funded at just under $23.7 b illion. Funding for foreign aid programs, the State Department, and the U.S. Information Agency that was last authorized by the Foreign Relations AuthorizationAct for Fiscal Year 1994 and 1995 and the International Security and DevelopmentCooperation Act of 1985 totals just under $13.8 b illion in 1998. Over $13.6 b illion of funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is consideredunauthorized in 1998; NASA spending was last authorized for 1993.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 4 Approximately $11.5 b illion of the appropriation provided for the Department of Justice in 1998 is considered unauthorized, although a general provision in theapplicable appropriation act extends the Department of Justice AppropriationAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1980 for another fiscal year. That $11.5 b illion excludes programs authorized in the Violent Crime Control and Law EnforcementAct of 1994 and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, amongothers. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 provided indefinite authorizations through 1997 for virtually all federal higher education grant programs. The GeneralEducation Provisions Act provides for an automatic one-year extension of allDepartment of Education programs, as noted in the appendixes. The Congress isexpected to continue work on reauthorizing the higher education programs early inthe next session.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 5 TABLE 1.

Unlike Appendix A, the list indicates (by public law)the amounts authorized to be appropriated in 1998 for expiring programs and activities, rather than the amounts actually appropriated in 1998. More than $289.6 b illion worth of authorizations /G26under the jurisdiction of 16 committees in each House /G26will expire at the end of this fiscal year (see Tables 3 and 4). Typically, authorizing committees attempt to reauthorize programs before theyare set to expire. The largest expiring authorization is the annual portion of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. Another annual authorization set to expireis the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 authorized more than $26 b illion in spending for federal highway, railroad, and mass transit programs in 1997. During its first session, the 105th Congress crafted a multiyear reauthori-zation of those programs, but the legislation was not passed before the end of thesession. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997 extends most of theprograms temporarily through parts of 1998. Other significant federal programs set to expire at the end of fiscal year 1998 include veterans' medical care and construction and leases of medical facilitiesauthorized in the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, as well as most of the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration, which were lastauthorized in the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. In addition, mostof the programs authorized in the Human Services Amendments of 1994 are set toexpire at the end of 1998. They include Head Start, Community Services BlockGrants, and various community food and nutrition programs.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 8 TABLE 3.
