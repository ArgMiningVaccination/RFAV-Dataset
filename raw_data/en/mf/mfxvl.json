May be an option for the treatment of CNS relapse of high grade lymphoma. ICD-10 codes Codes with a prefix C 85 Regimen details Day Drug Dose Route 1 Methotrexate 500mg/m2 IV infusion 1 Methotrexate 3g/m2 IV infusion 2 Calcium folinate As below IV/PO 2 Cytarabine 2g/m2 BD (12 hours apart) IV infusion 3 Cytarabine 2g/m2 BD (12 hours apart) IV infusion Pre and post hydration required, to commence prior to methotrexate, as below. The above regimen is for patient s < 75 years of age. For patients 75 years, discuss with consultant. Cycle frequency 21 days Number of cycles 2-4 cycles. Disease should be reassessed after 2 cycles before proceeding to 4 cycles. Administration Methotrexate pre and post hydration: 1000mL should be commenced 8-24 hours prior to methotrexate at a suggested rate of 1000mL over 4 hours and continued concurrently during methotrexate infusion an d until calcium f olinate rescue is no longer required . Full dose methotrexate should only be given in the presence of a normal serum creatinine and CrCl 80mL/min. See below for dose reductions in renal impairment. Prior to commencing methotrexate, pat ients must have a urine pH 7.0 and a urine output 100mL/hour. This should be maintained during treatment and until calcium folinate rescue is no longer required. Fluid balance should be closely monitored and urine pH measured hourly . Additional sodium bicarbonate (either added to fluids or given orally) may be required to maintain urine pH 7.0 . Methotrexate is given in 2 separate doses. Methotrexate 5 00mg/m2 is administered in 250mL sodium chlorid e 0.9% over 15 minutes . This is then immediately followed by the 3g/m2 dose administered in 1000mL sodium chloride 0.9% over 3 hours . Calcium folinate is commenced 24 hours after the start of the first methotre xate infusion at a dose of 15mg/m2 every 3 hours for 6-8 doses. It is administered as an IV bolus or IV infusion in 100mL glucose 5% over 30 minutes. Calcium folinate is then given every 6 hours until serum methotrexate level <0.1 mols/L. It may be given orally after the first 24 hours if the patient is compliant, not vomiting and otherwise without complication. Calcium folinate is available as 15mg and 30mg tablets. High Dose Methotrexate and Cytarabine Version 1 Review date : April 2018 Page 2 of 4 Serum methotrexate levels should be taken 48 hours after the start of the methotrexate infusion and then every 24 hours . If the 48 hour level is >2.0 mols/L the dose of calcium f olinate should be doubled. S erum methotrexate levels and U+Es must be checked every 24 hours and urine output and pH every hour. C alcium f olinate rescue and urine pH should be maintained 7.0 unti l the methotrexate level is <0 .1mols/L . The dose of calcium folinate should also be increased if serum creatinine increases > 50% from baseline. Cytarabine is administered in 1000mL sodium chloride 0.9% over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 2 and 3 . A total of 4 doses are given. Pre-medication Pre-hydration as above. Emetogenicity This regimen has high < 20mL/min) for first 2 weeks. Antiemetics as per local policy. Mouthwashes as per local policy H2 antagonist or PPI as per local policy GCSF as per local policy. Prednisolone 0.5% eye drops QDS (to avoid chemical conjunctivitis cytarabine ) Calcium folinate as above. Cytarabine is neutral (Group 1) Methotrexate is an inflammatant (Group 2) Investigations - pre first cycle Investigation Validity period (or as per local policy) FBC (with film) 72 hours and daily during treatment U+E (including creatinine) 72 hours and daily during treatment LFTs 72 hours and twice weekly during treatment Consider echocardiogram and/or lung function tests if clinically indicated. Investigations - pre subsequent cycles Investigation Validity period (or as per local policy) FBC Twice a week between cycles and 72 hours before next cycle U+E (including creatinine) Twice a week between cycles and 72 hours before next cycle LFTs Twice a week between cycles and 72 hours before next cycle Serum methotrexate levels, as above. Standard limits for administration to go ahead If blood results not within range, authorisation to administer must be given by prescriber/ consultant Investigation Limit Neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L Platelets > 100 x 109/L Clearance (CrCl) Bilirubin 1.5 x ULN AST/ALT 3.5 x ULN Version 1 Review date : April 2018 Page 3 of 4 Dose modifications Haematological toxicity Grade 3 -4 cytopenias are expected with this regimen. Delay treatment if neutrophils < 1.0 x 109/L and/or platelets < 100 x 109/L until count recovery. Renal impairment Discuss with consultant as some circumstances may warrant 100% dose. CrCl Discontinue If patient has raised creatinine and methotrexate level > 2 .0 mols/L , seek specialist renal advice. Hepatic impairmen t Discuss with consultant as some circumstances may warrant 100% dose. Bilirubin (x ULN) AST/ALT (x dose 1.5 and 3.5 100% 100% 1.5 - 3 and 3.5 100% 50% 3 - 5 or > 3.5 75% 50% > 5 Discontinue 50% Cytarabine dose should be reduced to 50% if bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN. Doses may be escalated in subsequent cycles in the absence of toxicity (consultant decision). Note: raised transaminases and/or bilirubin may occur for up to 2 weeks after methotrexate. Other toxicities Toxicity Definition Methotrexate Cytarabine Cardiovascular Grade 3 -4 Interrupt treatment until resolved Interrupt treatment until resolved Coagulation Grade 4 75% dose 75% dose Gastrointestinal Grade 4 75% dose 75% dose Pulmonary Grade 4 75% dose 75% dose If pleural effusion or ascites present, methotrexate should not be given due to risk of accumulation and prolonged toxicity. Adverse effects - for full details consult product literature/ reference texts Serious side effects Myelosuppression Cardiotoxicity Neurotoxicity Acute pulmonary toxicity Nephrotoxicity Hepatotoxicity CNS toxicity (cytarabine) Infertility Version 1 Review date : April 2018 Page 4 of 4 Frequently occurring side effects Myelosuppression Diarrhoea Fatigue Nausea and vomiting syndrome (fever, myalgia, rash) Significant drug interactions - for full details consult product literature/ reference texts Warfarin/coumarin anticoagulants: increased or fluctuating anticoagulant effects. Avoid if possible, consider switching patient to a low molecular weight heparin during treatment or if the patient continues taking an oral anticoagulant monitor the INR at least once a week and adjust dose accordingly. Methotrexate: Avoid all nephrotoxic agents NSAIDS : increase risk of methotrexate toxicity - avoid Omeprazole : potential to increase methotrexate leve ls Co-trimoxazole : if used concurrently may cause severe bone marrow depression - avoid Theophylline : may reduce theophylline clearance - avoid Acetretin : increased risk of hepatitis Penicillins : may reduce excretion of methotrexate levels Cytarabine: Digoxin: cytarabine may affect plasma digoxin levels - consider monitoring Additional comments It is expected that patients receiving high dose methotrexate will develop hypertransaminasaemia and occasionally hyperbilirubinaemia. These elevations can last up to 2 weeks following the methotrexate infusion . Persistent hyperbilirubinaemia and/or grade 3 -4 hypertransaminasaemia for longer than 3 weeks should result in discontinuation of t reatment. ________________________________________________________ _____ ___________ ____ ____________ ____ References Summary of Product Characteristics Methotrexate (Hospira ) accessed 28 Jan 2015 via www.medicines.org.uk Summary of Product Characteristics Cytarabine (Pfizer ) accessed 28 Jan 2015 via www.medicines.org.uk Ferreri Reni M, Foppoli high -dose methotrexate versus high -dose in patients with primary CNS lymphoma: a randomised phase 2 trial.
