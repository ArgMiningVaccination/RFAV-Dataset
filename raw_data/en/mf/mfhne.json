The Agency is developing a communication strategy in conjuncti on with the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Def ra) and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) to inform stakeholders of the change in the Agency's advice. Secretariat December 2006 Change in FSA Advice on Botulism in Cattle 1. There has been a recent amendment to the FSA's advice on the management of outbreaks of suspecte d botulism in cattle following recommendations in the ACMSF's repor t on Botulism in Cattle (ACM/800). 2. Prior to the Committee's report, t he Agency's policy w hen managing cases of suspected botulism in cattle was to request that the farmer agrees to a voluntary restriction order on the movem ent of livestock and on the entry of meat and milk from the a ffected herd into the food chain. These restrictions applied for a period of 14 days from the onset of the last clinical case or 17 days from the removal of the suspect ed source of botulism and applied to both affected and healthy cattle within the herd. 3. An ad-hoc group of the ACMSF wa s convened in 2004 to consider the potential risk to human health from food chain issues linked to botulism or suspected botulism in cattle, particularly in relation to the sp reading of poultry litter on agricultural land. Based on a thorough review of the scientific literature their report conclu ded that the current volunt ary restrictions on meat and milk from clinically affected ca ttle appear to be appropriate and such foods should continue to be withheld fr om the food chain du e to concern that this may pose a risk to consumers. 4. However, the report al so concluded that voluntary restrictions applied to unaffected cattle could be considered to be over-precautionary based on current scientific evidence. This was ma inly because the botulinum toxin types identified in animals (C and D) have ra rely been associated with disease in humans. In addition, there is little evid ence to suggest that any human cases of botulism from meat and milk consumption have occurred and there is a lack of clinical cases of botulism occurring in suckler calves in herds in which there were cows affected by botulism. The report therefore recommended that in the absence of other signs, there should be no requirement to restrict entry into the food chain of m ilk or meat from healthy ca ttle from farms where there have been clinically suspected ca ses of botulism in cattle. 5. The draft ACMSF report and recommendat ions were the subject of a three month consultation with stakeholders and other interested parties. No objections were received on the recomm endations to relax restrictions on meat and milk from healthy cattle from farms where cases of botulism are suspected. The finalised report was endor sed at the main ACMSF meeting on 28 th September 2006 and has been publishe d on the Agency's website; http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedi a/pdfs/botulismincattle.pdf 6. The FSA is implementing the c hange to its advice and will no longer request voluntary restrictions for health y cattle from farms where cases of botulism are suspected. However, this will need to be reviewed if new evidence emerges that the botulinum toxi n types that affect humans (i.e. A, B and E) are causing outbreaks in cattle. The FSA will still be informed of cases of suspected botulism in cattle as ther e may be additional issues for the FSA to consider to ensure that the food chain is protected. 7. The ad hoc group of the ACMSF did not a ssess the risk to human health from food chain issues asso ciated with suspected botulism in sheep or goats. These incidents are less common than th ose involving cattle and the Agency will ask the ACMSF to consider this in the near future. The FSA will therefore continue to request voluntary restrict ions for healthy sheep and goats from farms where cases of botulism are suspec ted until this has been reviewed by the ACMSF. 8. The Agency is developing a communi cation strategy in conjunction with Defra and VLA to inform stakeholders of the change in the Agency's advice. This is likely to involve a letter to the consultation list for the ACMSF's botulism in cattle report and articles in the Veterinary Record, VLA newsletter and farming press. It is anticipated that this will be disseminated in early December. 9. There is some evidence to suggest that access to litter from deep litter broiler houses is a factor in the occu rrence of disease in recent outbreaks of suspected botulism in cattle. We wo uld expect litter containing carcase material to be especially high risk source material. In so me cases the litter had been spread on land on which cattle were grazing or on adjacent fields, in others animals gained access to a st ack of stored litter. The Agency's communication strategy will include links to guidelines on Defra's website. These aim to control the risk of botulis m in cattle associated with poultry litter. 10. Other recommendations in the Co mmittee's Botulism in Cattle report will be considered by the Agency in 2007. "}
