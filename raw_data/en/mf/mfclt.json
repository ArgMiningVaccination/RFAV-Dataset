The [Spa](http://www.fourseasons.com/seychelles/spa/) at Four Seasons Resort Seychelles has teamed up with [Vaishaly,](http://www.vaishaly.com/) London's leading facialist, to launch her new treatment - The Vaishaly Experience. This profoundly relaxing and healing treatment is based on cranial sacral therapy and is offered by an elite group of highly experienced therapists, all personally trained by Vaishaly over a six month period. Cranial sacral therapy is an alternative medicine therapy traditionally used by osteopaths, massage therapists, naturopaths, chiropractors, and occupational therapists. Vaishaly has taken this proven therapy and beautifully incorporated it into a transformational experience. During the Vaishaly Experience, the therapist places her hands on the client, allowing her to tune into the craniosacral rhythm. She gently works with the spine and the skull and its cranial sutures, diaphragms and fascia. In this way, the restrictions of nerve passages are eased and the movement of cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal cord is optimized. This results in deep natural relaxation and boosts the immune system in a substantial way. The technique is highly effective at dealing with stress, deep healing and can often result in a euphoric sensation and deep meditative relaxation. Vaishaly comments, \"Most of us have such busy minds that we are never able to mentally switch off, even when we sleep. I've used my knowledge from cranial sacral therapy and my intuition to get clients into this deep meditative state where I am able to actually switch their mind off even for those who find it hard to let go. The results are beyond a miracle; the deepest relaxation and healing is achieved resulting, not only in radiant healthy and younger looking skin, but a total body and mind de-stressing experience.\" The Vaishaly Experience is a perfect harmonious balance between Vaishaly's signature facial massage technique known as her \"anti-ageing beauty secret\" and cranial sacral therapy techniques that have been skillfully and sensitively introduced to bring about profound therapeutic changes throughout the body. The Spa at Four Seasons Resort Seychelles provides an idyllic setting for such a healing treatment as it is hoped that guests will be able to relish the longer term benefits that come with rest and relaxation enjoyed on holiday. The combination of healing properties of organic essential oils and ingredients in the Cleansing Balm and Night Nourisher applied during the treatment and Vaishaly's unique massage technique will improve elasticity and tone, boost circulation, eliminate puffiness, define facial contours and features as well as plump skin; diminish fine lines and wrinkles, to reveal an even, radiant and polished youthful complexion. This unique treatment - The Vaishaly Experience - allows the individual to completely surrender, de-stress and embark on a special journey of the deepest meditative relaxation, resulting in renewed energy, vitality and skin rejuvenation. General Manager and Middle East lead for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts Global Spa Task Force [Alex Porteous](http://press.fourseasons.com/seychelles/hotel-team/alex-porteous.html) adds, \"When we discovered The Vaishaly Experience, it was clear that we had discovered something unique; a perfect practice to complement the blissful repose of our Resort and Spa. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced. The Vaishaly Experience brings, in one 90-minute treatment, the sense of calm you would normally only feel after a week of your vacation. Not to mention the 'holiday glow' that we are all looking to attain. We're delighted to be working alongside Vaishaly, whose extensive experience and dedication to her clients' wellbeing and beauty beautifully complements our own philosophy, to bring this truly memorable and transformative Spa experience to our guests.\" Four Seasons Resort Seychelles is known for its beautiful setting next to the white sands and blue ocean of Petite Anse bay.
