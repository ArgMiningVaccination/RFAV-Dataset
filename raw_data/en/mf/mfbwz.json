Under the EPR10 we don't consider radioactiv ely contaminated land, per se, as either the \"keeping\" or \"use\" of radioactive material, or the \"accumulation\" or \"disposal\" of radioactive waste. However, as soon as any action is taken in relation to that radioactively contaminated land and waste is generated, then the waste is, if within scope, subject to the EPR10 and requires a permit or compliance with exemption conditions. Remediating (cl eaning up) land contaminated with radioactivity can generate radioactive waste. Examples of such waste include contaminated soil or rubble excavated from the site for disposal; contaminated groundwater discharged from a site to a local watercourse or publi c sewer; and contaminated dust that becomes airborne as a result of the work. We have to authorise any accumulation and/or disposal of radioactive waste resulting from remedial / clean- up work, unless the waste is exempt . Exempt values for the dispos al of solid radioactive waste are derived mainly from the Government's Low Level Waste Policy of 2007 as well as some minor exemption provisions that existed prior to 2011 (when the exemption regime was established within the EPR10 by amendment). This incl udes the exemption for Very Low Level Waste via co- disposal with substantial quantities of non- radioactive waste.
