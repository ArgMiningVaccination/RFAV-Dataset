All member countries submit an annual national re-port and, in addition, a number of standardised tables, mainly epidemiological data. In 2008, two comprehensive questionnaires have also been completed, on treatment programmes and on prevention of health-related harm associated with drug use. They have been submitted sepa- rately to the EMCDDA. As in previous years, this 8 th annual national re- port on the drug situation in Norway has been drawn up in accordance with the reporting guid-elines common to all member states in the EMCDDA. Since the report is intended to be brief and to primarily cover important develop- ment trends, it may appear rather fragmentary. Little of the information provided in last year's report will be repeated in this report. References are included instead. However, we hope that the report will prove useful to readers who wish to familiarise themselves with the drugs situation in Norway. SIRUS wishes to express its gratitude to all experts, external partners and public insti- tutions that helped in the preparation of the re- port. Our thanks go in particular to the co-aut-hors who have made textual contributions and to the author of the selected topic.

Among young adults in their twenties, the figu- res are substantially higher, both for ever having used and recent use. In a survey from 2006, life- time prevalence among the 21-30 age group had increased considerably in the preceding eight ye-ars, both for cannabis and other commonly used drugs. However, the prevalence for recent use, during the past six months, has been quite stable overall. The next nationwide survey among the popula- tion as a whole is scheduled for 2009. Injecting drug use The trend for the number of injecting drug users remains largely unchanged; the figure increased until 2001, then fell until 2003 before levelling out. Summarising estimates from two methods, it was calculated that there were approximately 8,500 to 12,500 injecting drug users in Norway in 2006. Treatment Data from treatment services are still only avail-able at aggregate level. The inclusion of all ad- missions to the interdisciplinary specialist health service in the Norwegian Patient Register will start on 1 January 2009. A waiting list guarantee for children and young people entered into force on 1 September 2008. The waiting list guarantee is intended to ensure that no one who is entitled to necessary medical help shall have to wait for more than maximum 65 working days for treatment, and everyone will be entitled to an evaluation within 10 working days (as opposed to 30 working days for those Summary Main findings National policies and context A temporary Act relating to injection rooms ap-plies until 16 December 2009. On 31 October 2008, a consultation proposal was distributed in which it is proposed to make the Act permanent. The proposal means that it will be up to the indi-vidual municipalities to establish injection rooms as part of their overall services. It is proposed to discontinue the state grants that were available as part-financing during the trial period. The Regu-lations that have been issued will largely be con- tinued in their present form in order to enable the measure to be defined as a health service. In October 2007, the Government presented an action plan to the Storting (Parliament) for the drugs and alcohol field. It includes goals and me-asures for prevention, treatment and rehabilita- tion and entails a gradual escalation of funding in this field in the period up until 2010. The plan includes alcohol and drugs policy as well as na-tional and international measures. The plan aims for a policy with a clear public health perspecti- ve. The aim is to raise professional standards through research and by strengthening compe- tence and quality. As regards services, the princi- ple is that the ordinary services should also be available to people with drug or alcohol pro-blems. Cooperation between the different bodies and administrative levels is emphasised, as is the user perspective. Drug use in the population The annual questionnaire survey among young people aged between 15 and 20 in 2007 shows that cannabis, primarily hash, is still the drug most young people report having used. However, after peaking at the turn of the millennium, a clear reduction has been registered in recent years. The proportion who state that they have used other drugs also increased in the late 1990s before stagnating/ declining in recent years. The Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 7 over the age of 23). In connection with the amendment of the law, a practice guide and a prioritisation guide are being issued that are in- tended to ensure uniform, good professional practice in the services. Health correlates, consequences and responses In Norway, there are two bodies that register drug-related deaths. According to preliminary statistics from the National Criminal Investiga - tion Service (Kripos) for 2007, the number of drug-induced deaths was 200, an increase of 5 on 2006. Very many of the deaths are believed to be due to extensive polydrug use. The most recent data from Statistics Norway are from 2006. They show a total of 251 drug-related deaths. Suicides in which narcotic substances were used are included here. There is reason to believe that the data from Statistics Norway are more reliable since this body prepares figures on the basis of medical examiners' post-mortem examination reports and death certificates in ac-cordance with the WHO's ICD 10 codes. In 2007, 248 new cases of HIV infection were re- ported. Only 13 of these cases were among injec-ting drug users. The number of HIV-cases has remained relatively low for a number of years, and little new infection is detected in this group. Since the turn of the millennium, only sporadic, individual cases of hepatitis A have been repor - ted among drug users. On the other hand, there has been a considerable increase in hepatitis B since 1996. In 2007, 60 of a total of 118 reported cases of acute hepatitis B were among injecting drug users. In Norway, hepatitis C is not monitored to the same extent as hepatitis A and B, and the num-ber of new cases of drug users being infected is therefore not known. From 1 January 2008, the notification criteria for hepatitis C have been changed, so that we can expect a better overview of the incidence among injecting drug users next year.Medically assisted treatment (MAT) can undou-btedly be argued to be an important factor in the effort to prevent overdoses. The design of and participation in the Norwegian programme pro- bably contribute to reducing the annual number of overdose deaths to a considerable extent. The MAT programme is big in the Norwegian con- text, and the number of clients is steadily increa- sing. By the end of 2007, the programme inclu-ded more than 4,500 persons, mostly injecting drug users. Oslo is the only municipality that has made use of the trial scheme for injection rooms. On as- signment for the Ministry of Health and Care Services, the Norwegian Institute for Alcohol and Drug Research has evaluated the trial sche-me in Oslo in its first two years of operation, Fe- bruary 2005-February 2007. The report was pub- lished in January 2008. The state gave grants to low-threshold health services for substance abusers in 34 municipali-ties in 2007. A comprehensive evaluation was carried out of the services in 2007. The overri-ding goal was to answer the question of whether the services contribute to establishing an ade- quate service for substance abusers, mostly hard-core drug addicts, who do not use or are not reached by the ordinary health services. In the report, it is stated that, in general, the services appear to succeed in providing good help for 80 per cent of the users, while 20 per cent do not get sufficient help for various reasons. Reported drug offences Following an increase from 2005 to 2006, the number of reported drug offences fell in 2007. The use of drugs and drug crimes pursuant to the General Civil Penal Code were as frequent as in 2006. Thirteen hundred cases of the most seri-ous type of drug crimes were registered in 2007, slightly up on previous years. The number of arrests in 2007 on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or other substances shows little change in relation to pre- vious years. The number of cases in which drugs The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 8 number of seizures, the proportion of methamp- hetamine is increasing substantially in relation to amphetamine. It was approximately 35 per cent in 2007. There is no evidence to indicate that the importation and distribution of amphe-tamine and methamphetamine has changed, and Norway is probably still a substantial market for these two drugs in the European context. While both the number of seizures and the amount of cannabis seized declined, the cultiva- tion of cannabis plants was uncovered on an ex-tensive scale. During the last six months of 2007 and into 2008, the police uncovered a large num- ber of \u00abplantations\u00bb in rented houses, particu-larly in Eastern Norway. The vast majority of the \u00abgardeners\u00bb, and probably also the ringleaders, are of Vietnamese origin. As for prices, the price level for smaller quantiti- es in 2008 seems to have largely remained stable for most of the types of drugs since the last over - view produced by the police in 2006. In nominal terms, prices have probably fallen slightly, rather than the opposite. The most striking develop- ment is that the price of cocaine appears to have fallen for typical sales doses. Naturally, prices for drugs on the illegal street market are far from ac- curate and thus must be treated with considera- ble caution.and other intoxicating medicinal drugs were found in blood samples has remained stable for the last five years, at approx. 4,000 cases. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is one of the most frequently found substances in blood samples from arrested drivers, besides alcohol. The pro- portion of cases in which THC is found appears to be relatively stable, at around 30 per cent of the samples received. In recent years, methamp- hetamine has been increasingly found in blood samples from arrested drivers, while the trend for amphetamine appears to be declining. Drug markets The most striking development in 2007 was the large reduction in the amount of heroin seized. While the number of seizures again increased somewhat after a steady decline during the last six to seven years, much less heroin was seized in 2007 than in the preceding years, eight kilos - compared with 93 kilos in 2006. Even though the quantity seized is a less reliable indicator of prev-alence than the number of seizures, it is none-theless the case that so little heroin has not been seized since 1990. The reduction most probably does not reflect availability to the same extent. The price level has remained more or less un- changed, and no reports have been received of a heroin drought of any length. In the first half of 2008, the situation has changed in that several large seizures have been made and the number of seizures is again increasing. Record amounts of amphetamine and methamp- hetamine were seized in 2007. In terms of the PART A New developments and trendsThe Drug Situation in Norway 2008 10 1.1 Legal framework The temporary Act relating to injection rooms1 (discussed in NR 2007, Chapter 1.1) applies until 16 December 2009. On 31 October 2008, a con- sultation proposal was distributed in which it is proposed to make the Act permanent. The pro-posal means that it will be up to the individual municipalities to establish injection rooms as part of their overall services. It is proposed to discontinue the state grants that were available as part-financing during the trial period. The Regu- lations that have been issued will largely be con- tinued in their present form in order to enable the measure to be defined as a health service. Waiting list guarantee for children and young people In April 2007, the Government presented Propo- sition No 53 to the Odelsting (2006-2007) in which it proposed authorising the issuing of reg- ulations containing a statutory waiting list guar - antee for children and young people under the age of 23 with mental illnesses and substance abuse. The proposition was adopted in Decem-ber 2007 and the regulations entered into force on 1 September 2008. The waiting list guarantee is intended to ensure that no one who is entitled to necessary medical help shall have to wait for more than maximum 65 working days for treat-ment, and everyone will be entitled to an evalua- tion within 10 working days (as opposed to 30 working days for those over the age of 23). See also Chapter 5.1. On 22 April 2008, the Ministry of Health and Care Services distributed a proposal for consul-tation that will make it a statutory requirement for health personnel to contribute to attending to 1 Temporary Act No 64 of 2 July 2004 relating to a trial scheme for premises for the injection of drugs (the injection room scheme)the needs of children when parents, as a result of mental illness, drug addiction/alcoholism, seri- ous somatic illness or injury, are not capable of or are unable to provide a child with the neces-sary help and care. The purpose of the amend-ments to the law is to ensure that the children of such patients are identified and taken care in a better and more systematic way than at present. The children and parents will be given informa-tion and guidance, and they will be consulted. Among other things, this will require changes in the duty of confidentiality to which health per - sonnel are subject. It is also proposed that the specialist health service shall, insofar as necessa- ry, have health personnel with particular respon-sibility for following up children. 1.2 Institutional framework, strategies and policies The Minister of Health and Care Services has overall responsibility for drugs and alcohol poli- cy in Norway and for coordinating efforts in the field. Drugs and alcohol policy involves several different sectors and requires cooperation and coordination across ministry and agency bound- aries. Moreover, there is a tradition in Norway for pursuing a holistic alcohol and drugs policy, and there will therefore be one integrated action plan for the whole field. In addition to the Ministry of Health and Care Services, the most involved ministries are the Ministry of Labour and Social inclusion, the Mi- nistry of Children and Equality, the Ministry of Justice and the Police, the Ministry of Local Go- vernment and Regional Development and the Ministry of Education and Research. The respec-tive directorates, the Norwegian Institute for Al-cohol and Drug Research, AS Vinmonopolet, the county governors and the regional drugs and al- cohol competence centres all have important re- sponsibilities in the field of drugs and alcohol 1. National policies and contextAnnual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 11 overview of the progress and status of each indi- vidual measure and for the plan as a whole. In other respects, the general division of responsi- bility in the public administration will apply. The Directorate of Health (formerly the Directo- rate for Health and Social Affairs) is an executive and advisory body in the drugs and alcohol field. It is responsible for implementing large areas of the drugs and alcohol policy. The Directorate has wide-ranging responsibility for the escalation plan and it has chief responsibility for 58 of the 147 individual measures in the plan. Moreover, it shall ensure that an overview of the drugs and alcohol situation is available at the regional and local level, and it will publish an annual status re-port. Responsibility for interdisciplinary specialist tre- atment has been assigned to the four regional health authorities. Norwegian drugs and alcohol policy is decentralised to a great extent, and the municipalities have been delegated considerable responsibility for prevention, rehabilitation and reintegration of substance abusers in the local community. Evaluation of policies and strategies Many of the measures in the escalation plan will be specified in more detail during the plan peri- od. In order to ensure systematic further devel- opment and implementation, a system of coordi-nation meetings between affected ministries and relevant subordinate agencies has been estab-lished. The Ministry of Health and Care Services will be in charge of coordination, and it will also be responsible for coordinating the escalation plan with other plans. The status and progress of the different measures will be reported annually to the Ministry of Health and Care Services, and this reporting will form the basis for an annual summary of the attainment of goals and the progress of the measures. In connection with the Directorate of Health's grant schemes, great emphasis is placed on eva- luating the measures and earmarking funds for such evaluations. The goal is to contribute to im-policy. Good contact and cooperation between the different bodies is emphasised. 1.2.1 Norwegian National Action Plan on Alcohol and Drugs In October 2007, as part of Proposition No 1 to the Storting (2007-2008) for the Ministry of Health and Care Services, the Government pre- sented an escalation(action) plan for the drugs and alcohol field. It includes goals and measures for prevention, treatment and rehabilitation and entails a gradual escalation of funding in this field in the period up until 2010. The plan includes alcohol and drugs policy as well as national and international measures. The plan aims for a policy with a clear public health perspective. The aim is to raise professional stan-dards through research and by strengthening competence and quality. As regards services, the principle is that the ordinary services should also be available to people with drug or alcohol pro-blems. Cooperation between the different bodies and administrative levels is emphasised, as is the user perspective. The overriding goals are: A clear public health perspective Better quality and increased competence More accessible services and greater social inclusion Binding cooperation Increased user influence and greater attention to the interests of children and family members See NR 2007 Chapter 1 for a more thorough de-scription of the performance goals in the escala-tion plan. Implementation of policies and strategies The involved ministries shall cooperate during the plan period on continuous follow-up of the National Action Plan for Alcohol and Drugs. The plan assigns chief responsibility for each measure to a specific body. That body will be responsible for instigating measures and involving affected parties. Separate reporting procedures have been developed for the escalation plan that provide an The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 12 In 2007, the cost of interdisciplinary specialist treatment for problem drug and alcohol users amounted to EUR 287.5 million2 (NOK 2.3 bil- lion) of the regional health authorities' budgets. The figure includes the treatment of both alcoho- lics and drug addicts. However, the estimate only includes institutions specifically aimed at drug addicts and alcoholics. The costs of treatment of drug and alcohol problems at other institutions (for example in the mental health care services) cannot be quantified, and it will therefore come in addition. In the national budget for 2008, an additional EUR 15.63 million (NOK 125 million) was allo- cated to the drugs and alcohol field for following up and implementing measures in the escalation plan. The allocations break down as follows: EUR 5.75 million (NOK 46 million) to boost acute treatment, detoxification and MAT EUR 1.5 million (NOK 12 million) for the establishment of a system of drugs and alcohol advisers at the county governor offices EUR 2.88 million (NOK 23 million) for trial schemes with \u00abspecial coordinators\u00bb in the municipalities EUR 0.88 million (NOK 7 million) for prevention and early intervention EUR 0.88 million (NOK 7 million) for dental health services for persons in MAT EUR 0.38 million (NOK 3 million) to boost drugs and alcohol research EUR 0.25 million (NOK 2 million) to strengthen the regional drugs and alcohol competence centres EUR 2.13 million (NOK 17 million) for municipal measures in the drugs and alcohol field EUR 1 million (NOK 8 million) for the Pathfinder prison project 2 Conversion rate 1 EUR=NOK 8.00proving quality and supporting knowledge-bas- ed strategies and measures by ensuring continui- ty and local support. 1.2.2 New research centre The Norwegian Centre for Addiction Research - SERAF , which was established in autumn 2007, is located in the same premises as the Medica- tion Assisted Rehabilitation centre for South- eastern Norway and the department of specialist outpatient clinics in the Clinic for Drug Abuse and Dependence at Aker University Hospital. The Centre (www.seraf.uio.no/en g) will prima- rily focus on clinically relevant drug research. The Centre shall have a national role in recruit-ment and education, functioning as a network builder for drug research in Norway. SERAF shall have an intra-faculty function and multidisciplinary composition, and it shall re- present sound expertise at international level in clinically relevant drug research. The research will be organised in four research groups: 1 Vulnerability to and development of dependency conditions 2 Drug-related and co-morbid conditions 3 Interventions - treatment and prevention 4 Health service research. The research centre will be evaluated after five years and, provided that the evaluation is posi- tive, it will be maintained for a further five years. 1.3 Budget and public expenditure Law enforcement No comprehensive overview is available. Social and health care Alcohol and drug-related tasks are part of the or - dinary services. Isolating and quantifying costs from the social and care services that relate to drug problems is very complicated, and such fig-ures can therefore often be misleading.Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 13 challenges, and measures that promote integra- tion are given high priority. These measures will specifically target young people who make little use of existing cultural and leisure services and provide better opportunities for qualification, in-clusion and coping. Grants for Voluntary work etc. are administered by the Directorate of Health. The grants are gi- ven in the form of project and operating grants for voluntary organisations in the drug and alco- hol prevention field. The purpose is to help orga-nisations that work to reduce the consumption and harm caused by drugs and alcohol to carry on and develop their efforts. The allocation for 2008: EUR 11.3 million (NOK 90.4 million).

In the national budget proposal for 2009, it is proposed to increase the allocation to the drugs and alcohol field by EUR 37.5 million (NOK 300 million). Special grant schemes In addition to the ordinary block grant funding allocated to municipalities and health authori- ties, funds are channelled to special-priority pur - poses through grant schemes that are largely ad- ministered by the Directorate for Health. The grant schemes are divided between two items in the national budget: Grants for municipal drug and alcohol measu- res - 2008: EUR 21.59 million (NOK 172.7 mil- lion). Among other things, grants shall be used to strengthen personal guidance and individual follow-up, low-threshold health measures for al- coholics and drug addicts, a trial scheme for in- jection rooms, dental health services for people with drug or alcohol problems and publications such as \u00ab=Oslo\u00bb. Voluntary drug and alcohol prevention work etc . - 2008: EUR 14.98 million (NOK 119.8 million). Grants are earmarked for follow-up, care and re- habilitation services run by voluntary organisa- tions and private undertakings, self-help and in-terest groups and work among family members, measures aimed at prostitutes and The street hospital in Oslo. In addition, EUR 444,425 (NOK 3.55 million) is channelled through the regional drug and alcohol competence centres in order to stimulate efforts by the municipalities and spe- cialist health service. The grant scheme Measures among children and young people in large towns and cities is admi- nistered by the Ministry of Children and Equali- ty. Grants for youth measures are given to 23 ur - ban municipalities and, in 2008, they amount to EUR 2.1 million (NOK 16.8 million). These me- asures should target youth groups and youth mi-lieus that are deemed to be at risk. Y oung people from immigrant backgrounds face particular The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 14 1.4 Social and cultural context Mass media campaigns In order to increase awareness about the damage alcohol can result in and to increase knowledge about which methods work best, the Directorate of Health also ran the campaign - www.setteg- renser.n o in 2008. Such campaigns are followed up at the local level, among other things through cooperation with the parents council for primary and lower secondary schools. Y oung people and parents are particularly important target groups and there must be agreement between the infor - mation aimed at these two groups. In addition, people from immigrant backgrounds and preg-nant women are given priority. More emphasis will be placed on adapting information to suit the section of the population at which it is aimed. Moreover, the Directorate's information efforts should support and strengthen the understand- ing that a restrictive alcohol policy is necessary.ed knowledge and recognised methods.

International actions Grant for 2007 to UNODC: EUR 3 million (NOK 24 million).Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 15 The percentage of 15-20 year-olds in Norway who state that they have ever used hash or mari- juana has been around 11 to 13 per cent during the last few years, while the proportion reporting having used the drug during the last six months has been around six per cent. The corresponding percentages around the turn of the millennium were approximately 18 and 9-10 per cent, re-spectively. If we look at the same age group among those who live in Oslo, there has also been a steady reduction in the proportion who report ever having used cannabis. In the last few years, slightly less than 20 per cent report having used cannabis, while around nine per cent report having used cannabis during the last six months. The corresponding percentages around the turn of the millennium were approximately 28 and 16 per cent, respectively (Figure 2).

For example, the proportion of 15-20 year-olds in the country as a whole who state that they have ever used amphetamine has been around three to four per cent in the last two to three years, while the proportion stating that they have ever used ecstasy has remained at 2.1 Drug use in the general population No new information available. The most recent survey of the general population's drug use was car - ried out by SIRUS in autumn 2004. The main re-sults were discussed in NR 2005, chapter 2.1. The next nationwide survey is scheduled for 2009. 2.2 Drug use in the school and youth population 2.2.1 Drug use among youth aged 15-20 Data have been analysed from the annual ques- tionnaire survey among young people aged be- tween 15 and 20 in 2007. Since the division into age groups and questions about recent drug use in this survey are not in harmony with the division used by the EMCDDA, the data cannot be includ-ed in standard tables. Cannabis, primarily in the form of hash, is the drug most young people report having used. After peaking at the turn of the millennium, a reduction has been registered in recent years (Figure 1).

Drug use in the populationThe Drug Situation in Norway 2008 16 measured by questions about whether young people had been offered various drugs, or belie- ved they could obtain them. The proportion of 15 to 20 year-olds in the country as a whole who state that they have ever been offered cannabis has been around 30 to 40 per cent for the last five years, while the proportion who believe that they could obtain cannabis in two to three days if they so wished has been around 50 to 65 per cent. In around two to three per cent for several years. The corresponding figures for Oslo are two to four per cent for amphetamine and the same for ecstasy. The decline appears to be somewhat gre-ater among young people in Oslo than in the co-untry as a whole. There does not seem to have been any increase in the availability of illegal drugs in recent years as Figure 4: Percentage of youth between the ages of 15 and 20 in Oslo who have ever used various drugs,1970 - 2007 (three-year sliding average). 012345678 1970197219741976197819801982198419861988199019921994199619982000200220042006 Amphetamine Heroin LSD Cocaine Ecstasy GHB Source: SIRUSFigure 3: Percentage of youth between the ages of 15 and 20 in Norway who have ever used various drugs,1986 - 2006. 012345 198619901991199219931994199519961997199819992000 2001200220032004 Cocaine Ecstasy GHB Source: SIRUSAnnual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 17 falling response rate, there is further reason to emphasise that there is uncertainty attached to the results from one single year. The purpose of the surveys is primarily to serve as a tool for exa-mining trends over time. Given that the youth surveys have been carried out for so many years, they represent time series that are relatively uni- que in the international context, and they are therefore assumed to be useful even though the response rate has been relatively low in recent years. 2.2.2 Hash use among young adults Data from SIRUS's questionnaire surveys among young adults aged between 21 and 30 were pre-sented in NR 2007 Chapter 2.2.2. A study A representative sample of young women and men have, since they were in their teens in 1992 until they became adults in 2005, answered a questionnaire about cannabis on four occasions (Pedersen, 2008). They were also asked about their parents' education and social class, about their own education and position in the employ- ment market, about whether they have received social security or welfare benefits, and about their income. In addition, various measures of marital status/partnership and starting a family were examined. The study is based on Young in Norway - a longitudinal study, which is de- scribed in detail by Strand and von Soest (NOV A 2006). A sample of 2,819 persons answered the questionnaire on all four occasions, which means an accumulative response rate of more than 70 per cent for all the surveys. Results At the age of 15 to 16, less than ten per cent had experience of using cannabis, but quite a few made their debut with the drug in their late teens and also during their twenties. At the end of their twenties, 40 per cent of the men and 29 per cent of the women had used cannabis at some time, and 18 per cent of the men and eight per cent of the women has used cannabis during the past year (both differences between the sexes p < 0.001).the country as a whole, the proportion who state that they have been offered amphetamine, co-caine and ecstasy has been around 7 to 13 per cent in the last two to three years. If we look at 15 to 20 year-olds in Oslo alone, the proportion who state that they have been offered cannabis is around 40 to 50 per cent, while slight- ly more than 60 per cent believe they could ob-tain cannabis in the space of two to three days. In Oslo, the proportion who state that they have been offered amphetamine, cocaine or ecstasy has been around 10 to 15 per cent in the last two to three years. Otherwise, the 2007 survey confirms the trend we have seen in recent years that the proportion expressing a positive attitude to drugs is no lon- ger increasing. During the last two to three years, approximately six to eight per cent of 15 to 20 year-olds in the country as a whole and seven to ten per cent in Oslo have expressed the opinion that it should be permitted to sell cannabis freely here in Norway. Statistical margins of error Note that the figures are subject to statistical margins of error and must be interpreted with great care. Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that questionnaire surveys are always sus-ceptible to certain sources of error (not everyone responds, some responses may contain deliber - ate or inadvertent errors etc.), and that the sur - veys referred to here target young people in gen-eral. There is reason to believe that young people who regularly use drugs, either cannabis or stronger substances, will be underrepresented in the surveys. In the annual youth surveys up until the mid- 1990s, approximately 70 per cent answered the questionnaire, but the response rate has fallen to between 40 and 50 per cent in recent years. This is worrying, and it is probably related to the fact that very many questionnaire surveys have been carried out among young people in recent years. It is not unlikely, therefore, that a certain 'fatigue' arises among respondents. On the basis of the The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 18 high probability of dropping out of the study (Pedersen, 2008). The study complements the picture provided by other studies carried out in recent years. This ap-plies in particular to Drug use among young adults aged 21 to 30 (discussed in NR 2007, Chapter 2.2.2) in connection with which SIRUS have collected data. In this study, the proportion who have ever used cannabis in Norway increa- sed from 22 per cent in 1998 to 34 per cent in 2006, while the proportion reporting recent use (here: The last six months) did not increase from 2002 to 2006 (Table 2). The 21 to 25 age group was highest here, with 12 per cent both years, while approximately nine per cent in the 26 to 30 age group reported use during the last six months. The incidence among men is more than double that among women. A low and falling re-sponse rate is a problem in connection with this study as well, and this can be assumed to result in underestimation of use.

Drug use among persons from immigrant backgrounds Quantitative research carried out on large popu- lations shows that immigrant youth as a group use drugs less than Norwegian youth. Qualita-tive surveys also indicate that the use of alcohol and drugs is smaller and more controlled than In the teenage years, there were no significant differences between the sexes as regards the use of cannabis. Use in the teenage years was not as- sociated with social marginality and low social class among parents, but, during their twenties, the cannabis users were increasingly young, sin-gle men with interrupted education who were outside the employment market. Many respondents, particularly among the young men, make their debut with cannabis in their twenties. It is surprising that as many as 30 per cent of young men in their late twenties who live in Oslo have used cannabis during the past year. In the group with low education and among tho- se who are outside the employment market, the proportion who use drugs is much higher than this. However, it must be pointed out that most respondents in the sample report low-frequent use of cannabis. Moreover, the study shows that the recruitment base during the respondents' early teens is not characterised by low social class or social margi-nality among the parents. On the other hand, however, a pattern develops with increasing age whereby young adults who have dropped out of school and who have failed to find a foothold in the employment market are more likely to beco- me cannabis users. Those who do not marry or form partnerships during their twenties are also at increased risk. A single man, resident in the Oslo region, with an interrupted education and not in permanent employment who lives off so-cial security or welfare benefits will have a high probability of being a cannabis user. The study is assumed to be representative and has a good response rate. It forms a good basis for studying the prevalence of cannabis use among the young adult population in Norway. However, there is an accumulated dropout rate of 30 per cent for the four data collections. Previ-ous analyses show that dropping out is selective in a manner that means that there are probably more cannabis users among the dropouts than in the sample as a whole. It must be assumed, not least, that regular use of cannabis entails a very Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 19 About hash in particular Five of the surveys contained questions about the use of hash. Adults 2004: SIRUS's nationwide survey of drug and alcohol use among adults in 2004 included 3,191 persons in the age group 15 and above (see NR 2005 Chapter 2.1 for more information). Young adults 2006: SIRUS's survey of drug and al- cohol use among persons aged between 21 and 30 from 2006 included a total of 4,193 persons (see NR 2007 Chapter 2.2.2 for more information). Attitudes (HoldRus): The survey was carried out by SIRUS and the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Service to study drug and alcohol use and attitu-des to the use of drugs and alcohol among stu- dents at lower secondary schools in Oslo. The survey's gross sample included students at six schools in the Oslo area who completed the se-venth, eight and ninth forms in 2002. The survey was repeated among the same students in the four following years. A total of 4,396 question- naires were completed, and the response rate va-ried between 86 and 90 per cent. Youth 2006/2007: SIRUS's annual survey on the use of drugs and alcohol among young people covers the 15 to 20 age group. See Chapter 2.2.1. Questions about immigrant background were included from 2006. In order to strengthen the sample, the figures from the 2006 and 2007 sur - veys are shown combined. The total number of respondents for the two years was 8,108. The Schools Survey 2004: SIRUS's survey of drug and alcohol use and its consequences in connection with the evaluation of the Regional Project - see Chapter 3 for more information. The gross sample in the survey consisted of all students in lower and upper secondary schools in 16 selected municipalities outside the big towns and cities in Norway. The gross sample for 2004 consisted of 25,872 students from 91 schools. A total of 20,703 forms were completed. The response rate was 80 per cent.among youth from Norwegian backgrounds. At the same time, however, since the turn of the millennium, an open drugs and alcohol scene that is dominated to a great extent by teenage boys and young men from immigrant back-grounds has emerged along the Akerselva river in Oslo city centre. In addition, there are signs that there has been an increase in the numbers of immigrant youth in the hardest drug milieus in Oslo, and that the use of drugs and alcohol and problem use is greater among immigrants and immigrant youth than previously assumed (Bergengen and Larsen, 2008). Quantitative surveys Since 2004/2005, SIRUS has asked respondents about their own and their parents' birthplace in its questionnaire surveys. This provides an op- portunity to report on drug and alcohol use among groups of persons from immigrant back-grounds (Ved\u00f8y and Amundsen, 2008). Data from seven surveys has been used to de- scribe the use of alcohol, cigarettes, oral moist snuff and cannabis among young people and adults with backgrounds from different countri- es, in both Oslo and Norway as a whole. Based on Statistics Norway's definition of immigrants, figures have been presented for the different con- tinents. This is because categorisation by country of birth would result in many categories often containing a small number of cases. For the sur - veys carried out among adults, the continent was decided by the respondents' country of birth. Among young people, the continent was decided on the basis of the father's place of birth. Statistics Norway defined the immigrant popula- tion as \u00abpersons with two parents born abroad: first-generation immigrants who have migrated to Norway, and persons born in Norway with two parents who were born abroad\u00bb. Respon-dents' own country of birth is defined as the mother's country of residence when the respon- dent was born.The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 20 fathers born in Asia or Africa were more restric- tive with respect to the use of hash. The category that uses hash most is boys from Norway and Europe. We also find that youth in Oslo are less restrictive in terms of using hash than youth in the rest of the country. The use of hash varies to a certain extent with national background, and it is among people from Norwegian and European backgrounds that we find the largest proportion who state that they have tried hash. However, it appears that the differences between the surveys, i.e. between the different age groups, are greater than the diffe- rences between persons from different national backgrounds. Among ethnic Norwegians, the figure for ever having used hash is clearly higher among young adults than among adults as a whole. The same cannot be claimed to apply to persons from im- migrant backgrounds from Asia and Africa, partly because the differences are less than for ethnic Norwegians and partly because the num-ber of respondents is too low. So, again with all the necessary reservations, immigrants from Asian backgrounds do not seem to be picking up Norwegian (bad) habits as regards the use of hash. The higher risk of non-Western immi- grants being offenders in drug crimes is not re-flected in hash use as measured in population surveys. Few of the surveys in this report enable more thorough analyses to be carried out of how drug and alcohol use varies with, for example, socio- economic status, degree of assimilation or inte- gration etc. There are also few of the surveys that include so many persons that it is possible and meaningful to carry out quantitative analyses of specific drug/alcohol cultures. Statistical sources of error In population surveys, there are some margina- lised groups that do not take part. Heavy drug and alcohol use among persons of no fixed abode or who move frequently, for example in and out of treatment, will therefore not be reported. In Among adults from immigrant backgrounds The survey shows that it was more common to have smoked hash among adults from immigrant backgrounds born in Norway or Europe than among persons from immigrant backgrounds from Asia and Africa. In all the surveys, we also found that a larger proportion of persons born in Europe had tried hash than of persons born in Norway (Figure 5). We also found that the pro-portion was higher among young adults than in the Norwegian population as a whole. In addi- tion, the use of hash among young adults was more common in Oslo than in the rest of the country.

The main tendency is that the use of hash is greater among youth in Oslo than in the rest of the country and that young people with fathers from Europe are least abstentious in rela-tion to hash use. If we look at the surveys together and examine the use of hash by father's country of birth, the main tendency was that young people with Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 21 As part of the overview of current knowledge, experience-based material was also collected from 34 selected municipalities (of 53 asked) and 14 wards in Oslo. In terms of the information re-ported by the individual municipalities, there appear to primarily be differences between town and country. Naturally, Oslo clearly stands out, because it is the biggest city and has the largest proportion of immigrants 3. The main impression is that, except for Oslo and some of the big towns and cities, immigrant youth and drug and alco- hol use is not much of an issue. The figures for the other municipalities are so small that it is a matter of individuals rather than groups. Immigrant youth as a group use drugs and alco- hol less and their use is more controlled than among Norwegian youth, although there has been an increase in the number of immigrant youth in the hardest drug milieus in Oslo. The differences between boys and girls' use of alcohol are small among youth from Norwegian back- grounds. Among immigrant youth, there is a clear preponderance of boys among those who have drunk alcohol. The differences between youth from Norwegian backgrounds and youth from immigrant backgrounds are smaller in re- lation to the use of other drugs than alcohol. 3 As of 1 January 2006, 36 per cent of the non-Western im- migrant population lived in Oslo. If the neighbouring county of Akershus is included, 46 per cent live in what is normally referred to as the Oslo area www.ssb.n o.school surveys among young people, those who are frequently absent without reason because of antisocial tendencies and who probably have higher drug and alcohol use will not take part. Moreover, most people will have a tendency to be somewhat biased in their reporting in the di- rection of the norms for and social desirability of drug and alcohol use within their own culture/social group. Ethnic Norwegian youth may well over-report drug and alcohol use, while ethnic Norwegian adults and Muslims regardless of age may well under-report such use (Ved\u00f8y and Amundsen, 2008). Other surveys The Oslo Drug and Alcohol Addiction Service Competence Centre has produced an overview of what is known about drug and alcohol use among immigrant youth (Bergengen and Larsen, 2008). In the summary of various self-report surveys, several of which have already been men- tioned, it is confirmed that a large proportion of immigrant youth report less drug and alcohol use than ethnic Norwegian youth, but there are exceptions.The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 22 ties and a questionnaire survey at all the lower secondary schools in Oslo and among parents. The study shows that most schools, roughly 75 per cent, implement the programme in full. The reason why some schools did not implement all the components has to do with the high propor - tion of foreign language speakers among stu- dents or that the schools were already involved in other preventive programmes in the field. The results of the evaluation showed that the follo- wing factors are important in connection with implementation: Support must be ensured for the programme. In Oslo this was done through a decision of the City Council stating that an alcohol prevention programme was mandatory. Raising competence is decisive. In Youth & Alcohol, this means providing courses for teachers and group leaders. The Educational Service and Oslo Drug and Alcohol Addiction Service Competence Centre followed up the decision by organising a seminar for teachers and helping to finance the training of group leaders. The schools' management must follow up the decision to implement the programme. In Oslo, this meant that those in charge of schools had to ensure that information about Y outh & Alcohol was mandatory and was received by all teachers. The decision also had to be followed up by sending teachers on courses. Structural factors at individual schools are important. In Oslo, factors such as sufficient time, technical equipment, finances, planning work and the proportion of students from multicultural backgrounds proved to be important. Individual participants' motivation and competence in relation to the different parts of the programme. The analyses show that The Government's escalation plan for the drugs and alcohol field in Norway (discussed in Chap- ter 1) includes efforts to raise professional stan- dards in preventive work in Norway. Informa-tion work will be strengthened, with more targeted information and more participation by young people and parents. Knowledge must be built and attitudes changed in order to reduce the harmful effects. Public support for the volun-tary sector will continue as part of the quality boost, preventive measures will be coordinated and the work on drug and alcohol prevention in the workplace will be intensified (the Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2008). 3.1 Universal prevention The Y outh & Alcohol project - a process evaluation The preventive measure Y outh & Alcohol (dis- cussed in NR 2006 Chapter 3) is based on a so- cial cognitive strategy that focuses on children and young people's attitudes and norms in rela-tion to alcohol. Central teaching methods in- clude problem-based learning and the use of in- formation and communications technology. The target group consists of eighth form students, teachers and parents/guardians, with follow-up in the ninth form. The programme has been pro- cess evaluated with the focus on initiation and implementation of the programme in lower sec-ondary schools in Oslo in the 2006/2007 school year. The purpose was to identify factors that in- fluence initiation and implementation in schools, and to further develop and improve the web so- lution and implementation strategies. The evaluation methods consisted of observation of implementation, group interviews with selec-ted students and teachers at selected schools, do- cument analysis, conversations with various par -3. PreventionAnnual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 23 ween municipalities. As regards adaptation and further development of preventive measures, lo- cal expertise has also increased. The organisation of the project in the municipalities has been functional, and the project has had good politi-cal and administrative support locally. The report points out that none of the municipa- lities in the Regional Project has implemented the most effective strategies in drug and alcohol prevention, such as restricting the availability of alcohol and stricter enforcement of the regula-tions for the sale and serving of alcohol. 3.2 Selective prevention Measures aimed at immigrant youth's use of drugs and alcohol In 2006, the then Directorate for Health and So- cial Affairs gave the Oslo Drug and Alcohol Ad- diction Service Competence Centre the task of mapping available knowledge about immigrant youth and their use and problem use of drugs and alcohol. The intention was to examine whether and to what extent youth from immigrant backgrounds need special measures to prevent the develop- ment of drug and alcohol problems, and whether or not various immigrant youth groups need se-parate early intervention measures in the drugs and alcohol field. See also Chapter 2.3.1, Other surveys. A report was published in 2008 (Ber - gengen and Larsen, 2008). The report contained the following proposals: Measures aimed at youth from immigrant backgrounds should be based on existing measures. There should be greater focus on violence- related problems and problem behaviour that can conceal problem drug and alcohol use. There should be greater awareness of problems relating to the migration experience. Greater focus should be placed on the resources that exist in immigrant milieus the schools' management, teachers, parents/guardians and students are generally positive to the programme. The evaluation also revealed that schools with a high proportion of students from multicultural backgrounds face special challenges relating to linguistic and cultural barriers in relation to alcohol as a topic (Steinkjer, 2008). Evaluation of the Regional Project In order to encourage coordination and coopera- tion in the municipalities, the Regional Project was started in nine pilot municipalities in 2004 (discussed in NR 2005, Chapter 3.3). The main goal was to develop effective preventive measures and to further develop existing measures with a view to limiting the use of drugs and alcohol and harm caused by drugs and alcohol, with the main focus on children and young people. The project was evaluated by SIRUS in 2007 (Baklien, Pape, Rossow and Storvoll, 2007). The analyses are based on extensive data, including data from interviews with players at the central and local levels, observations of meetings and the implementation of measures, questionnaire surveys of 40,000 school students and attempts to buy alcohol in shops that sell beer. According to the evaluation report, the Regional Project's main goal of reducing the use of drugs and alcohol and limiting drug and alcohol-rela- ted harm among young people was not achieved during the period covered by the evaluation (2004-2006). Nor did the project contribute to limiting young people's access to alcohol. The re- port points to several possible explanations for the lack of results. Only a few of the measures the directorate recommended to the municipalities had a documented effect on drug and alcohol use and drug and alcohol-related harm. Many of the measures had a long time perspective, and some of them were implemented in incomplete \u00ablight\u00bb versions. On the other hand, the project has resulted in some municipalities setting up new multidis- ciplinary collaborations, both internally and bet-The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 24 sible children growing up in families with prob- lem drug or alcohol use, and to give them ade- quate follow-up and help as early as possible. As part of the project, approximately 160 teachers and nursery school staff from four municipali-ties in two counties (Telemark and Vestfold) have taken courses. The project has been evaluated by SIRUS (Baklien and Wejden,2008). The intention of the project was to create change, both at the individual level and the collective le- vel. The evaluation attempts to track these chan-ge processes. The most important source of data consisted of extensive qualitative interviews with a total of 60 course participants and other key persons. The evaluation is also based on a questi- onnaire survey and document analysis. The proportion who state that they have sufficient competence to identify signs that a child is suffe- ring because of problem drug or alcohol use in the family has increased considerably during the pro- ject period. The course has created enthusiasm and a moral obligation in relation children who need help. The participants state that they have become more secure and more observant. There are still many who are reluctant to conduct the necessary conversation with the parents, but the informants find that the course has provided them with met- hods that to a certain extent make it easier to talk to the parents. In other words, there is reason to be-lieve that at least some children will receive spee- dier and better help as a result of the project. The project also had ambitions of creating structu- ral and relational changes. The goal was to develop a model that could coordinate efforts between tho- se who meet children who are subjected to problem drug or alcohol use in the family and those who meet parents who have drug or alcohol problems. This goal was not achieved. One important reason appears to be that it was unclear whose responsibi-lity it was to initiate this coordination. The project did not take sufficient account of the preconditions and framework conditions that must be met if one is to succeed in developing new models for coope-ration. Efforts primarily targeted changes at the in- dividual level.that can protect against the development of destructive drug and alcohol use. There should be greater focus on poverty- related problems in relation to dealing. We need more knowledge about the use of drugs and alcohol among youth from immigrant backgrounds, about immigrant girls' use of drugs and alcohol, marginalised groups of youth from immigrant backgrounds, students and older youth from minority backgrounds and youth with one foreign and one Norwegian parent. 3.3 Indicated prevention 3.3.1 Early intervention On assignment for the Ministry of Health and Care Services, the former Directorate for Health and Social Affairs drew up a proposal for a na-tional strategy. The proposals were presented in the report 'Early intervention in the drugs and alcohol field. Central perspectives - relevant tar - get groups and arenas' , which was published in June 2007 (discussed in NR 2007, Chapter 3). In 2007, 12 different intervention projects were initiated under the auspices of the regional com- petence centres and financed by the Directorate for Health and Social Affairs. Most of them were projects that will run over several years and will receive further funding aimed at the designated target groups and arenas. One of the interven- tions, 'Children in families with drug or alcohol problems - early intervention' , has been evalua-ted by SIRUS. See below. Evaluation of the project 'Children in families with drug or alcohol problems - early intervention' . The project Children in families with drug or al- cohol problems - early intervention was devel- oped and implemented by the Borgestad clinic's competence centre in 2006 and 2007. The goal was to increase the action competence of staff in schools, nursery schools, the social services and the child welfare services. The intention was to enable those involved to identify as early as pos-Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 25 the Mortality Multiplier questionnaire surveys among the police and the social services in the municipalities the Multiple Indicator Method There are insufficient figures for 2006 for the latter method to be used. Table 3 shows the estimates for the three methods. The figures in the Mortality Multiplier have been adjusted up slightly in relation to previously published figures for 2003 to 2005. This is because the basis for the calculations from Statistics Norway Causes of Death Register in pre-vious reports included too few deaths. The W orld Health Organisation (WHO) revised the coding of causes of death relating to drugs in 2002, and the changes were already implemented in the Causes of Death Register in Norway in 2003. This change has not been incorporated into our calculations until now. The revised figures for drug-related deaths in 2003 to 2005 are shown in Chapter 6.1. The trend for the number of injecting drug users in Norway is unchanged; the figure increased un-til 2001, then fell until 2003 before levelling out. Summarising estimates from two methods, it was presumed that there were approximately 8,500 to 12,500 injecting drug users in Norway in 2006 5. 5 The estimate has an upper limit that is higher than that result- ing from the Multiplier Method, but lower than that resulting from the Multiple Indicator Method and the Municipal Survey. This is because the latter two methods probably produce figures that are too high.4.1 Prevalence and incidence estimates of PDU See the data in Standard Tables 07 and 084. The EMCDDA defines problem use as \u00abInjecting use of drugs or prolonged/regular use of opiates, cocaine and/or amphetamines.\u00bb In Norway, we only have information about the group that in- jects drugs. The estimated number of injecting drug users in a given year will also include per - sons in treatment or in prison if they inject one or more times during the year. So far, we lack good data sources that can provi- de figures for prolonged/regular use of opiates, cocaine and/or amphetamines. Including all ad- missions to interdisciplinary specialised treat- ment for drug problems in the Norwegian Pati-ent Register will gradually provide a much better overview of the number of persons in this group who apply for and are admitted to treatment. The number of injecting drug users in Norway is calculated using three methods that are descri- bed in detail in NR 2006, Appendix 1: 4 All the Standard tables referred to have been submitted to the EMCDDA separately.

The data basis includes both those who were in treatment at the turn of the year and those who concluded treatment during the year. The per - centage basis is therefore the sum of the two. The survey covers approx. 80 per cent of the clients, a slightly larger proportion than in 2006. The average age is stable and was 40.1 years in 2007 (2006: 39.9 years, 2005: 39.8 years). The same applies to the gender distribution. The pro- portion of women was approximately 30 per cent in 2007, the same as in 2005 and 2006. The dif- ferences between regions and centres are small. There is no indication that there are more youn-ger clients, even though it has been made clear that it is permitted to admit patients younger than 25 (note: The formal lower age limit for ad- mission to the programme is still 25 years). Retention According to the status survey for 2007, 91 per cent of the patients were in treatment, while 9 per cent had been discharged. However, it is possible that there are a greater number of dis- charged patients among the dropout group (those for whom a status form has not been submitted). The same type of survey for 2006 showed 92 per cent retention. Retention is thus at a stable high rate, but there are moderate but clear differences between the centres. The dos-age level of methadone and Subutex may be one of the reasons why so many remain in treat- ment. Higher dosages are used in treatment in Norway than in some other countries. The av-erage dose in 2007 was 109 mg of methadone per day. Two counties have an average of be- tween 120 and 130 mg. The dosage of buprenor - phine is unchanged or has increased slightly to an average of 18.6 mg in 2007. Social function Correspondingly, the survey shows a high pro-portion of benefit recipients. Thirty-nine per cent of the patients were benefits recipients, a slight increase on 2006 (37 %). Seventeen per cent had social security as their most important source of income, while this proportion was 19.5 4.2. Treatment demand indicator Data from treatment services are still only avail-able at aggregate level. The inclusion of all ad- missions in the interdisciplinary specialist health service in the Norwegian Patient Register will start on 1 January 2009. It is expected that it will be possible to report individual-based data to EMCDDA from 2010. Overviews from the cur - rent client mapping system run by SIRUS do not indicate how many individuals are included in the number of queries and admissions, which means that it is impossible to control for double registration. Moreover, the data basis does not distinguish between problem users of alcohol and drugs. Several characteristics of the clients, such as gen- der, age, education, income and most used into- xicant, taken from the client survey in 2006, were presented in NR 2007, Chapter 4.2.1. Since only small changes take place from one year to the next and the data are, as mentioned, only at the aggregate level, this will not be discussed further in this report. Instead, Chapter 4.2.2 will focus on data and profiles for clients in medically assi- sted treatment/rehabilitation. They are included in a nationwide client survey, but the probability of double registration is small here since most of them stay in the same treatment system all year. 4.2.1 Profiles of clients in medically assisted treatment See also the data in Standard Table 24. The Norwegian programme for medically assis- ted treatment (MAT) has been discussed in pre-vious reports to EMCDDA. See NR 2004 chapter 5.3 in particular. Data are reported annually in the form of status surveys from the 14 regional centres that make up the MAT programme. For 2007, a total of 4,014 forms were completed, while 4,542 persons were in treatment as of 31 December 2007. A to-tal of 562 persons had concluded treatment du- ring the year, 32 of whom had died. Forty-six persons were discharged in connection with mo-Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 27 Most centres in the Eastern Norway region, in- cluding Oslo, score particularly high. However, the findings are low in the international context. Cannabis Almost a third have used cannabis at least once during the last four weeks, the same proportion as in 2005 and 2006. Benzodiazepines The use found in the survey includes both pre- scribed benzodiazepines and illegally obtained benzodiazepines. The survey for 2007 shows that 42 per cent have used such drugs in the last month (2006: 41%). Less than half (18%) come from prescriptions. Roughly one in every four patients has thus used illicitly acquired benzodi- azepines. The use of this substance appears to be increasing. The increase is found in most of the centres. Central stimulants There is less additional misuse of such drugs. Nationwide, the proportion with proven use dur - ing the past four weeks was 16 per cent, roughly the same as in 2006. This involves both amphet-amine derivatives, and partly also cocaine, but cocaine is not checked regularly. It appears that the prevalence of central stimulants is greatest in Western Norway, where the use of buprenor - phine in treatment is particularly high. There is certainly nothing to indicate that this reduces the use of central stimulants. The goal of the treatment is rehabilitation. In this context, the survey indicates moderate success. While it is true that a large majority live in either own rented or owned housing, the proportion who neither have a job nor are in education is high, and many of them have been without work for years prior to MAT, while some of them have never been in employment. The health questions show that more than a quarter have a somatic ill- ness that affects how they live their lives and their life quality. Since many seems to progress via re-duced criminality and ordered finances towards a life on welfare benefits, this may be the most realistic rehabilitation goal. There are still many per cent in 2006, and 20 per cent in 2005. The proportion on medical/occupational rehabilita- tion benefit was 40 per cent in 2007 (31.5% in 2006 and 34% in 2005). All in all, this indicates a certain transition to disability benefit and slight- ly less use of social security benefits, without this being the result of more active use of rehabilita-tion. However, closer study of the pattern shows considerable differences between the centres. Housing conditions The proportion in their own rented or owned housing is surprisingly high, roughly eight out of ten in most centres. Oslo stands out with a lower proportion. Health conditions The survey's questions about health show that slightly more than a quarter (27%) have a somat- ic illness that is so serious that it affects how they live their lives and their life quality. There is also a considerable proportion with chronic infec-tions such as HCV . Nationwide, the proportion of patients with HIV is three per cent. In Oslo, the proportion was seven per cent. In addition, the proportion suffering from depression and/or anxiety is high. Additional misuse The reporting was carried out by combining in-formation about drug and alcohol use during the last four weeks and information from urine tests. Use is thus reported if there is one urine finding or information about at least one instance of the drug in question having been taken. Consider - able uncertainty attaches to all the reports be- cause the proportion stated as unknown is around 10 per cent for all the different types of drugs. On the other hand, there are major differ - ences between the centres as regards the propor - tion of unknowns. Opioids In 2007, the proportion of patients who had used a morphine-based drug in addition to the MAT medication during the last four weeks was 14 per cent for all the centres (2006: 13%). There are considerable differences between the centres. The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 28 1993. However, no new figures are available since this was last discussed in NR 2005 (Chapter 4.3).

It also provides advice about how this can be dealt with professionally in ac-cordance with the currently applicable profes- sional and legal frameworks. One goal is to en- sure equal treatment in the whole country. The primary target group for the guide consists of those who assess referrals to interdisciplinary specialiced treatment for drug and/or alcohol use. In practice, this will be the bodies appointed by the health enterprises to carry out such as-sessments. The guide will also be useful for social centres and first-line medical practitioners, as well as staff in the specialist health services. The document is not binding on service providers. However, the guide sets out the national health authorities' views on good practice and correct interpretation of the regulations. If the service chooses a different practice than that proposed in the guide, it should therefore be based on a concrete assessment. The courts and supervisory authorities normally base their decisions on such assessments. Pursuant to the Patients' Rights Act, section 2-2, patients are entitled to an evaluation of their sta- te of health on referral. Referrals to interdiscipli- nary specialised treatment for drug and/or alco-hol use can be made by the social services, the child welfare service, GPs, specialist physicians in private practice, physicians in other parts of the specialist health services, physicians in the prison health service or other health personnel who are entitled to refer patients to the specialist health service. Referrals must contain the infor -See also information in Structured Question- naire 27 part I: Treatment programmes and part II: Quality assurance. 5.1 Treatment systems Changes in the treatment systems in Norway have previously been discussed in NR 2004- 2006. The evaluation of the Administrative Alco- hol and Drugs Treatment Reform was discussed in NR 2007 Chapter 5.1.1. No new system chang-es have been introduced in the treatment area. A waiting list guarantee for children and young people entered into force on 1 September 2008. See Chapter 1.1. In connection with the amend-ment of the law, a practice guide and a prioritisa- tion guide are being issued that are intended to ensure uniform, good practise in the services. The escalation plan for mental health (1998- 2006) and the building-up of mental health care for children and young people in the municipali- ties will have consequences for the services offe- red to children and young people who are at risk of developing or have developed drug and alco-hol problems. At least 20 per cent of earmarked funds for the municipalities from the escalation plan for mental health will be used on measures aimed at children and young people. The muni-cipalities shall develop low-threshold services for examining, treating and following up chil- dren and young people with mental health pro-blems, irrespective of cause and background. The guide to mental health care for children and young people in the municipalities has been published. It provides the municipalities with advice and guidance about the development of services for children and young people at risk and about the prevention of mental health pro- blems and drug and alcohol dependency (the Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2008).5. Drug-related treatmentThe Drug Situation in Norway 2008 30 Social factors with considerable negative consequences for prognoses Other factors The Usefulness criterion requires an assessment of whether the medical help from the specialist health service will improve the patient's condi- tion or prevent deterioration. Medical help in-cludes actions that have preventive, diagnostic, treatment, health-preserving, rehabilitating or nursing and care purposes and that are carried out by health personnel. The main point is whether the medical help will lead to an im- provement in the patient's length of life and/or life quality of a certain duration or prevent dete-rioration. Usefulness is also present if the possi-bilities for treatment will be lost if the medical help is postponed. In connection with useful- ness, it must be assessed what a relevant course of treatment will be for the individual patient. Factors that are relevant in relation to the seri- ousness criterion should be compared with the following additional factors: The desire for change/ commitment Experience of treatment Problem use of short duration Cognitive functioning Degree of co-morbidity The criterion of Cost-efficiency means that the costs of treatment must be in reasonable propor - tion to the expected effects of the treatment, in terms of both improving the patient's state of health and preventing a deterioration of his/her state of health. Costs incurred in connection with previous treatment of the same patient shall be disregarded. The conditions for the right to necessary medical help are based on the main conditions being interconnected and on their being weighted in relation to each other (the Di- rectorate of Health, 2008).mation that is important in terms of evaluating the patient's state of health. The main conditions for the right to necessary medical help Three main conditions in the Prioritisation Reg- ulations section 26 shall be assessed individually and together. The Seriousness criterion requires an evaluation to be made of the patient's condition and of how the patient will most probably develop if medical help from the specialist health service is postpo- ned. The main topic for assessment will be the degree of drug and/or alcohol use and depen-dency, and the impact the problem use can be as- sumed to have on the patient's expected length of life and life quality. When sufficient insight has been gained into the patient's condition, it shall be assessed how the patient's condition will develop if medical help from the specialist health service is postponed in relation to the patient's expected condition if medical help is provided. In order for the crite- rion of seriousness to be met, it must be assumed to be most probable that the patient's length of life will be shorter or quality of life poorer if the medical help is postponed than would be the si-tuation if the patient receives the medical help. The following factors, which are partly linked to problems relating to problem use, will be rele-vant in the assessment: Danger to life and health/self-destructiveness Suicidality Pregnancy Crises and serious life events in connection with problem use Problem use at a young age Co-morbidity, somatic health Co-morbidity, mental health Care and control of small children 6 Cf. the new section 4 in Regulations No 1208 of 1 December 2000 on the prioritisation of health services, the right to neces- sary medical help from the specialist health service, the right to treatment abroad and about the appeals board, amended by Regulations No 833 on 25 July 2008.

Professional guide- lines and, if issued, regulations will replace the currently applicable circular relating to medical-ly assisted treatment, thus helping to make medi- cally assisted treatment a better service. The Ministry of Health and Care Services is said to be planning to present Regulations relating to medically assisted treatment in autumn 2008. Based on the contents of the draft regulations from the Ministry, the Directorate of Health is working on proposals for new guidelines for the medically assisted treatment and rehabilitation of opioid addicts and guidelines for the treatment of pregnant women in MAT and assistance to fa- milies up to school age. The proposals will be sent for consultation with a view to a decision being made in spring 2009.5.2 Drug-free treatment No major new evaluations or studies were car - ried out in 2007. 5.3 Pharmacologically-assisted treatment The evaluation of medically assisted treatment (see NR 2005, Chapter 5.3) shows that waiting times vary between the health regions. Treat- ment and rehabilitation services vary both be-tween and within municipalities and regions. As part of the follow-up of the evaluation, it has been decided (Proposition No 53 to the Odelst- ing (2006-2007)) to authorise the issuing of reg-ulations relating to medically assisted treatment. The regulations could include the purpose, crite-The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 32 With effect from 1996, Statistics Norway's figures have been based on EMCDDA 's definition of drug deaths. This broadened the inclusion crite- rion that had been used until then. In the period since 1996, Statistics Norway's figures have been consistently higher than the figures from Kripos. However, if suicide (by using drugs) and drug deaths among elderly people above the age of 65 are eliminated from Statistics Norway's statistics, the difference is smaller, although still conside- rable in some years. The trends are largely identi- cal in both series of figures, however.6.1 Drug-related deaths and mortality of drug users See the data in Standard Tables 05 and 06. Methodological considerations In Norway, there are two bodies that register drug deaths, Statistics Norway (SSB) and the Na- tional Crime Investigation Service (Kripos). Kri- pos bases its figures on reports from the police districts, while Statistics Norway prepares figures on the basis of medical examiners' post-mortem examination reports and death certificates in ac- cordance with the WHO's ICD 10 codes.

Health correlates and consequencesAnnual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 33 reduction if we compare the same two periods. In the first period, the proportion was 64 per cent, while it was just under 59 per cent in the latter period (p = 0,003). The youngest age groups' pro-portion of deaths has remained stable during the period 1996 to 2006 (Figure 6). Figure 6: Drug-related deaths broken down by age group, 1996-2006 01020304050607080 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006<20 years 20-2 9 years 30-4 9 years 50+ years Source: SIRUS and Statistics Norway During the period 1996 to 2006, there has been a certain increase in the proportion of women among mortalities (Figure 7). During the period 1996 to 2000, the proportion of women was 19.5 per cent according to the SSB statistics, while it had increased to 23.5 per cent in the period 2001 to 2006 (p = 0.008). Seen in a longer perspective, however, this variation seems to be within the \u00abnormal range\u00bb for the proportion of women. During the period 1980 to 1990, the average pro- portion of women among the mortalities was close to 22 per cent.

The revisions were implemented in the Norwegian Causes of Death Register as early as 2003, but they were not included in the Standard Tables until this year. The corrected figures show a higher estimate than previously reported by SSB. In order to highlight the discrepancy, both series for the period 2003-2006 are reported in Table 4. For the three years, the new figures represent an average increase in the estimate of slightly more than 20 per cent. The corrected figures for 2003-2006 are now directly comparable with the years 1996-2002. Situation and development The figures from both SSB and Kripos peak in 2000/2001. In the ensuing years, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of regis- tered drug deaths. The reduction since the turn of the millennium is most probably due to the strong increase in the number of clients on med- ically assisted treatment. Both the SSB figures and the Kripos figures appear to indicate that, af-ter the reduction following the peak years of 2000 and 2001, a certain stabilisation of the num-ber of mortalities has occurred. According to the statistics from Kripos for 2007, 26 of 27 police districts had registered drug-in- duced deaths. Oslo had most deaths (65), 33 per cent of the total. Very many of the deaths are be-lieved to be due to extensive polydrug use. In the early 1980s, the proportion of mortalities among those over the age of 30 was less than 20 per cent. The proportion has increased steadily, and in the 1990s it had reached 60 per cent accor - ding to SSB's statistics. The SSB statistics show that, for the years 1996 to 2006, the proportion of drug deaths in the 30 plus age group was approxi- mately 70 per cent on average. During the same period, the proportion over the age of 50 appears to have increased. If we compare the period 1996-2000 with the period 2001-2006, we find that the proportion in the first period was approx. 5 per cent as opposed to more than 11 per cent in the latter period (p< 0.001). For the 30 to 49 age group, on the other hand, we find that there has been a The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 34 Development into AIDS has been reported in 147 of these cases. The incidence of HIV among injecting drug users in the group has remained at a stable low level over the last decade, with about 10 to 15 ca- ses of HIV infection a year. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but a high level of testing, great openness regarding HIV-status within the user milieus, combined with a strong fear of being in- fected and strong internal justice in the milieu, are assumed to be important factors. In addition, many of the sources of infection in the milieu have disappeared due to overdose deaths or been rehabilitated through substitution therapy or other forms of rehabilitation. However, the ex-tensive outbreaks of hepatitis A and B in recent years, and the high incidence of hepatitis C, show that there is still extensive needle sharing. The HIV situation is therefore still unpredictable.6.2 Drug-related infectious diseases See the data in Standard Table 09. 6.2.1 HIV and AIDS In 2007, 248 cases of HIV infection were report- ed to the Norwegian Notification System for In-fectious Diseases (Table 5). Thirteen of these cases were among injecting drug users, ten men and three women. The median age was 39 years (24 to 48 years), all of whom were men. Five of the drug users had been infected in Oslo. The number of HIV-cases remains relatively low, and little new infection is detected in this group. As of 31 December 2007, a total of 541 persons had been diagnosed as HIV positive with injec-ting drug use as a risk factor. This amounts to 14 per cent of all reported cases of HIV since 1984.

Forty-eight per cent had tags indicating that they had been vaccinated against hepatitis B. In Norway, hepa- titis C is not monitored to the same extent as he-patitis A and B, and the number of new cases of drug users being infected with the hepatitis C vi- rus is therefore not known. From 1 January 2008, the notification criteria for hepatitis C have been changed, so that we can expect a better overview of the incidence of hepatitis C among injecting drug users next year. 6.3 Psychiatric co-morbidity No new information available.6.2.2 Hepatitis During the nationwide outbreak of hepatitis A from 1996 to 2000, 1,360 drug users were identi- fied as having acute hepatitis A. Since then, only sporadic, individual cases of hepatitis A have been reported among drug users. Since 1996, there has also been a considerable increase in hepatitis B among drug users. In 2007, 60 of a total of 118 reported cases of acute hepatitis B were among injecting drug users. During the pe- riod 1995-2006, the total number of reported cases of acute hepatitis B among injecting drug users was 1,871. In recent years, small-scale prevalence surveys have been carried out in connection with needle distribution in Oslo in order to register the inci- dence of, for example, hepatitis among injecting drug users. These Oslo surveys are the only pre-valence surveys that are carried out regularly among a representative sample of drug users in Norway. The 2007 survey showed that 69 per The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 36 7.1.1 Evaluation of the trial scheme for injection rooms The City of Oslo opened an injection room on 1 February 2005 after the Storting had passed a temporary act relating to a trial scheme for injection rooms (NR 2004 Chapter 1.1). Oslo is the only municipality that has made use of the trial scheme. The temporary act was origi- nally intended to apply until December 2007, but it was subsequently prolonged by two years (see NR 2007 Chapter 1.1). One reason for the prolongation was that the trial scheme was under evaluation and that the Ministry of Health and Care Services wished to study the evaluation carefully before arriving at a per - manent decision. In Chapter 1.1, an account is given of the Ministry's position in relation to the Storting with respect to a permanent act. On assignment for the Ministry of Health and Care Services, SIRUS has evaluated the trial scheme in Oslo. The report became avail-able in January 2008 (Olsen and Skretting, 2007). Some key data and an excerpt of the main conclusions of the report are presented below. In its first two years of operation, February 2005 to February 2007, 409 persons were re-gistered as users, and 383 of them used the in-jection room on one or several occasions. Of the 383, 71 per cent were men and 29 per cent women, 23 per cent were aged 30 or younger, 41 per cent were between 31 and 40 years old, and 37 per cent were older than 40. A total of 17,226 injections took place, i.e. an average of 24 injections a day. There are large variations in terms of how often the registered users have used the injection room scheme. Only 10 per cent have used the injection room scheme more than six times on average per 7.1 Prevention of drug-related deaths In Structured Questionnaire 23/297, a brief overview is provided of the coverage rate for interventions that can be seen as preventing acute drug-related deaths, including some data concerning the injection room in Oslo. In Chapters 7.1.1 and 7.1.2, an evaluation is presented of two types of intervention in which the prevention of overdoses is one of several goals. Medically assisted treatment (MAT) can un- doubtedly be argued to be an important factor in the effort to prevent overdoses. The design of and participation in the Norwegian pro- gramme probably contribute to reducing the annual number of overdose deaths to a consi-derable extent. The MAT programme is big in the Norwegian context, with more than 4,500 patients, mostly injecting drug users. Accor - ding to the status report for 2007, some three per cent of the patients experienced one or more non-fatal overdoses during the year. Slightly less than two per cent have attempted suicide. Some of the cases are assumed to be overdose cases without a clear suicidal intent. An average level of three per cent is not unre- asonable in a population with drug problems with a high incidence of depressive complain-ts, anxiety problems and difficulties in life. Thirty-two individuals who were part of the programme died during 2007. The causes of death were not stated, but it must be assumed that several of the deaths are not due to over - doses (Waal et al., 2008) 7 All Structured Questionnaires have been submitted to the EMCDDA separately. 7. Responses to health correlates and consequencesAnnual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 37 vided. Virtually no one has any objections to the guidance given in connection with injec- tions, how they are treated by staff or the equipment offered. The main changes they would like are an extension of the opening hours and permission to inject pills together with heroin. Insofar as it possible to operatio- nalise the dignity concept, the scheme can be said to have contributed to increased dignity for the target group in question. The scheme can be said to have provided greater dignity for drug addicts in the broadest sense in that it recognises the need to inject drugs in a manner that entails as little risk as possible. The scheme can also be said to provide a form of dignity for individual users in the way that the users are treated by the staff. 3. Professional health and social service fol- low-up of the users has only been registered in eight per cent of all visits. However, such follow-up is dependent on adequate staff le- vels. Expedient premises that provide an opp-ortunity for private conversations would also improve the possibilities for follow-up. 4. There is a limited basis on which to con- clude whether the injection room scheme has contributed to preventing infections and the spread of infections. However, the users have to comply with clear hygiene rules. They are also given concrete advice about how they can inject in a way that causes as little harm as possible with respect to sores and abscesses. They are given guidance on injecting in 13 per cent of the total number of injections, and 81 per cent of the users have received such guid- ance on one or more occasions. It must be as-sumed that the users take some of these \u00ables-sons\u00bb with them when they inject drugs elsewhere. Users also state that they have be- come generally more aware of hygiene when they inject. 5. There are no grounds for concluding that the injection room scheme has contributed to a re-duction in overdoses/overdose deaths in Oslo. If the scheme is to be capable of making such a month. Two-thirds have used the scheme two or fewer times a month on average during the period they have been registered. Eighty per cent of the users reported injecting 0.2 to 0.25 grams of heroin (a \u00abquarter\u00bb). Most users injected in their arms (64 %). Other body parts used for injections were the groin (19%), legs (15%) and neck (2%). Only 0.6 per cent of all injections in the injection room re- sulted in an overdose. Eighteen per cent of the users have experienced overdoses in the injec-tion room. None of the overdoses was fatal. Main conclusions The target group for the injection room scheme is \u00abhardcore heroin users over the age of 18\u00bb. The aims of the trial scheme are, in numerical order: 1 To assess the effect of freedom from prosecution for the possession and use of drugs in a limited area. 2 To contribute to more dignity for hardcore drug addicts. 3 To provide a better opportunity for contact and dialogue between drug users and the help services. 4 To contribute to preventing infections and the spread of infections. 5 To reduce the number of overdoses and overdose deaths. 1. The police have loyally supported the trial scheme. The provision on freedom from pros-ecution must be said to have had the effect that, from a legal perspective, it is practically possible to run an injection room scheme, even if it is impossible for staff to check that only one user dose of heroin is brought in. However, freedom from prosecution has also had the unintended effect that the possession of small amounts of heroin has in practice been further decriminalised in Oslo city cen- tre. 2. In general, the users of the injection room express great satisfaction with the service pro-The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 38 hold health services. Thirty of the services ans- wered the first part of the questionnaire, while 23 services answered the follow-up questionnai- re in autumn 2007. The final report is also based on two survey rounds carried out at intervals of six months among 400 users. Moreover, a new user survey was conducted in which 691 users filled in a form, and a survey of experiences in the rest of the services based on focus group in-terviews in some municipalities. The users of the low-threshold health services are largely hardcore drug addicts who get high often and who have been drug addicts for many years. The average age is approximately 39 years, while ten per cent of the users are under the age of 26. The most commonly used drugs are opio- ids, benzodiazepines, amphetamine and canna- bis. There are many combinations of different drugs and many people who use combinations that entail a high risk. For example, 95 of 400 users use a combination of heroin and Rohypnol and 80 per cent use heroin in combination with alcohol. Alcohol is stated to be the only intoxi-cant by 13 users. Many of them have major health problems. Many have particularly serious pro- blems relating to dental health. There are also very many who have problems with their mental health, housing situation and contact with their families. Mapping twice during a six-month period provi- ded a picture of the situation for the users over time. More than half the users had not experien-ced any change that was picked up on in the qu-estionnaire. The other half had experienced a change in their life situation, in either a negative or positive direction. Positive changes include users receiving treatment either in a treatment institution (roughly 10%) or mental health care (5%), being admitted to medically assisted treat- ment (5%) or having stopped using drugs (1%). Negative changes include the user being in pri-son (5%) or dying (1%). For the users, needle distribution, dialogue/gui- dance and nutrition are the most important rea-contribution, it must have sufficient capacity to cover a substantial proportion of the total num- ber of injections that take place. The evaluation makes no recommendation with respect to whether the trial scheme should be made permanent. However, it points out that a permanent injection room scheme must involve setting requirements for municipalities that wish to establish such a service. The premises must be expedient and guarantee the safety of staff. Staff training and working conditions must also be better than in the trial scheme. In July 2007,the injection room was moved to larger and more suitable premises in Storgata in Oslo city centre. The number of users has increased and the pro-fessional follow-up by health and social services seems to have improved. 7.1.2 Evaluation of low-threshold health services The state gave grants to low-threshold health services for substance abusers in 34 municipali-ties in 2007. The services are aimed at persons who use drugs particularly extensively and who need complex and concurrent services from dif- ferent agencies, but who are not capable of avail-ing themselves of ordinary health services. In the Government's action plan to combat drug and alcohol-related problems 2003-2005 (NR 2005, Chapter 1), low-threshold health services are highlighted as important focus areas in terms of reducing various kinds of damage to health re- lating to the use of drugs and alcohol, improving health and care services for addicts and prevent-ing overdoses. An evaluation was carried out of the services in 2007. The final report became available in Janu-ary 2008 (SINTEF, 2008). The overriding goal was to answer the question of whether the servi- ces contribute to establishing an adequate service for drug addicts who do not use or are not reached by the ordinary health services. The organisation and contents of the services were studied on the basis of the questionnaires distributed to representatives of 33 low-thres-Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 39 7.2 Prevention and treatment of drug-related infectious dis-eases In Structured Questionnaire 23/29, a brief over - view is provided of the coverage rate for services that can be regarded as preventing drug-related infectious diseases. No other new information is available. 7.3 Interventions related to psychiatric co-morbidity 7.3.1 National professional guidelines for examining, treating and following up persons with serious mental health problems and concurrent drug or alcohol problems. As mentioned in NR 2007 Chapter 7.2, the Di- rectorate of Health (formerly the Directorate for Health and Social Affairs) is charged with pre- paring professional guidelines for examining, treating and following up persons with serious mental health problems and concurrent drug or alcohol problems. The draft, which will be dis- tributed for consultation in autumn 2008, is ex- pected to be implemented in spring 2009. The guidelines will deal with three main areas: Knowledge about concurrent serious mental health problems and drug and alcohol problems Recommended methods for examination and diagnosis Recommended treatment and other follow- up The guidelines will be based on the best existing research and experience-based knowledge in the area. The different issues will be discussed and recommendations made to the relevant services. The recommendations shall be as concrete as possible and practicable in different situations. The basis for the recommendations must be doc- umented and prioritised.sons for using the low-threshold services. These are also the services most often provided to users. The low-threshold services provide a very wide range of services. In addition to health-related services such as improving general health, they include dental health and follow-up of various illnesses and dressing of sores, motivation to re-duce drug use and to use ordinary services and the provision of general care. On the other hand, emergency preparedness in relation to overdo-ses seems to be given lower priority. Only six services state that this is very important, while almost half answer that overdose emergency re- sponse is not part of the service. These are low figures. The high incidence of overdoses was central when the state decided to earmark funds for low-threshold health services for drug ad-dicts. In the report, it is stated that, in general, the ser - vices appear to succeed in providing good help for 80 per cent of the users, while 20 per cent do not get sufficient help for various reasons. The exceptions are needle distribution and condom distribution where few users do not get sufficient help. There can be many different reasons why help does not reach all users to the same extent. There are many whom it is particularly difficult to help because they are in a very difficult life si-tuation in which their ability to care for themselves is poor, and they have difficulties keeping appointments with other services that are brought in to help users. On the basis of the in-depth interviews with users, one can get the impression that low-thres-hold services are the part of the health and social services that the users feel most satisfied with. A critical methodology comment on the results co- uld be: The interviews were carried out in the premises of the low-threshold services and the informants knew that it was only the low-thres- hold service, and not other services, that was to be evaluated. They may therefore have been more cautious of criticising the service because they are so dependent on it.The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 40 Those who provide treatment/process cases in the specialist health service. The guidelines may also be important for other agencies that come into contact with the target group. The performance goal for the guidelines: Referrals from the first line service shall as far as possible contain an overall assessment of the patient's situation as regards both drug and alcohol history and mental state. The patients' mental health problem and problem drug or alcohol use shall be examined on a broad basis. The co-morbid condition shall be treated at the same time, either by the same treatment entity or through cooperation with different entities if dual competence is not available in one place. Individual plans shall be prepared that contribute to treatment of the patient as a whole. Professionals in mental health care and interdisciplinary specialised drug/alcohol treatment must have good qualifications for and skills in working with this group of patients. The measures that are initiated shall, in as cost-efficient a manner as possible, lead to a reduction in mental health symptoms and problem drug and alcohol use, as well as improving users' life quality and functional level (the Directorate for Health and Social Affairs, 2007).The target group of patients consists of per - sons with serious mental health problems and concurrent drug or alcohol problems (dual diagnosis 8) from the age of approximately 15 upwards. The definition of \u00abserious mental health problem\u00bb: By serious mental health problem in this context is meant 9: Schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psycho- ses, bipolar disorder, serious depressions and chronic long-term drug or alcohol-induced psy-choses. Serious personality disorders such as schizoid, paranoid, anti-social and emotionally unstable personalities are included, in addition to serious behavioural disorders among young people. Some other diagnoses may be relevant if the problem leads to a significant loss of func- tion, for example persons with prolonged anxi- ety problems that are present irrespective of the drug and/or alcohol use. Definition of \u00abdrug /alcohol problems\u00bb: By drug or alcohol problems is meant addiction, prolonged harmful use or abuse of in toxicants with the exception of tobacco 10. The terms drug/ alcohol problems and problem drug and alcohol use will be used interchangeably when discuss-ing problems in connection with the use of in-toxicants. Both terms include both medical and social consequences of problem drug and alco- hol use and drug/alcohol problems. The target group for the guidelines: Those who provide treatment/process cases in the social services and primary health services in the municipalities. 8 Dual diagnosis is primarily a system-related concept used to describe persons with serious mental health problems who also have a drug or alcohol problem. A broader concept is co-morbid condition or persons with serious mental health problems and drug or alcohol problems. 9 9 In the ICD-10 diagnosis system, this means the codes F20 to F30, F31, codes F10 to F19 with F17, and \u00absub- stance abuse\u00bb in DSM-IV . Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 41 Penal sanctions Drug crime results in more penal sanctions than other types of crime. Penal sanctions for drug crimes have increased most during the last de- cade and have contributed to a change in which groups of crime result in penal sanctions. From 33 per cent in 1998, drug crime is now the pri- mary offence in 41 per cent of all criminal cases. Eighty-seven per cent of all penal sanctions for crimes were imposed on people of Norwegian nationality, and eight per cent on people with European nationality. The proportion of foreign nationals was highest in connection with crimes against property and drug crimes, at 18 and 12 per cent, respectively. See Chapter 11 Sentencing statistics for more information about penal sanc-tions. 8.2.2 Driving offences Statistics relating to driving under the influence are prepared by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

The number of official com- plaints for the possession of small amounts of drugs (regulated in the Act relating to medicines) is 12 per cent lower than in 2006, and this con- tributes most to the reduction in the number of reported drug offences overall. The use of drugs (12,806) and drug crimes pursuant to the Gen-eral Civil Penal Code (17,779) were as frequent as in 2006. Thirteen hundred cases of the most serious type of drug crimes were registered in 2007, slightly up on previous years.

The analysis findings do not necessarily answer the question of whether or not the drug was ta-ken illegally. As a rule, several substances were found in the same blood sample.

Almost half of the inmates (45%) were what is described as \u00abhardcore\u00bb drug users in the period prior to imprisonment. A quarter of the inmates (26%) were regular and fre-quent injecting drug users in the period prior to their imprisonment. Just under a third (29 %) of the inmates had used drugs in connection with their current prison sentence. Cannabis was the drug most inmates reported having used. It was followed by amphetamine, then heroin. The data on which the analysis is based are data reported by the inmates themselves. In Decem- ber 2002, all inmates at all the 52 Norwegian pri-sons were given a questionnaire in which they were asked about their demographic characte- ristics, criminal history and use of alcohol and drugs. At the time when the survey was carried out, there were 2,687 inmates in Norwegian prisons. It was estimated that between 1,700 and 1,900 of them had used drugs during the period prior to their imprisonment. Between 1,100 and 1,300 had a serious drug problem, and between 600 and 800 were injecting drug users. Drug controls in prison Regular urine sample tests are the most common indicator of the extent of use and of which sub- stances are used in prisons. The National Insti- tute of Public Health has national responsibility for the securing of evidence, analysis and inter - pretation of drugs, medicines and poisons in samples taken from persons for whom the analy- sis results may have consequences in criminal law or corresponding consequences. Around 24,000 cases are received annually from the Correctional Services. Figure 10 shows an overview of the number of cases from prisons in which illegal narcotic substances or medicinal drugs were found. The number of such cases has increased from around 5,000 in recent years to almost 6,000 cases in 2007. Cannabis is the most common illicit drug. The number of cases invol- ving amphetamine and methamphetamine con-Cannabis Figure 9 shows that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is one of the most frequently found substances in blood samples from arrested drivers. The pro- portion of cases in which THC is found appears to be relatively stable at around 30 per cent of the samples received. Since 2002, the substance has been among the three most common intoxicants among arrested drivers. The fact that THC is found in a blood sample means that cannabis has been taken (usually smoked) shortly before the sample was taken, usually during the last 24 hours. Amphetamine/methamphetamine In recent years, methamphetamine has been in-creasingly found in blood samples from arrested drivers, while the trend for amphetamine appears to be declining. This may indicate that amphet- amine is being replaced by methamphetamine in some cases. Some of the methamphetamine is converted into amphetamine in the body. Many of the blood samples that contain methamphet-amine will therefore also contain amphetamine even if the person in question has not necessarily taken both drugs. If we wish to say something about the use of amphetamine and methamphet- amine combined, it is therefore misleading to simply add up the figures for amphetamine and methamphetamine. Cocaine The number of blood samples that tested posi-tive for cocaine in 2007 is more or less identical to the figures for the two previous years. The body converts cocaine into the inactive metabo- lite benzoylecgonin, a substance that does not have any effect. However, finding benzoylecgonin is definite proof that cocaine has been taken dur - ing the previous 24 hours (Norwegian Institute of Public Health). 8.3 Drug use in prison A study A survey (\u00d8deg\u00e5rd, 2008) that covered all Norwe-gian prisons showed that two-thirds of the in-The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 44 8.4 Social costs No new information available.

However, it is not possible to distinguish between lawful prescribed and illegally obtained metha- done. Methadone-assisted treatment is approved in prisons as a means of rehabilitating inmates with an opiate addiction.Figure 10: Drug finds in correctional service cases.

It will be assessed whether more in-mates with drug and or alcohol problems can serve part of their sentences in institutions pur - suant to section 12. Increased access to this form of serving of sentences is desirable. The financing of such measures is to be reviewed. More units aimed at mastering drug and alcohol problems are to be established in Norwegian pri-sons. In 2006, there were three units of this kind: in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim. In 2007, units aimed at mastering drug and alcohol problems were established in three new prisons. The pur - pose of the units is to improve the service to in-mates and convicted persons who are drug ad- dicts or alcoholics and who need treatment and rehabilitation. Staff at the units should have both health and social work and prison service back- grounds. The treatment and rehabilitation that is started in prison must be followed up after rele-ase. Steps have therefore been taken to facilitate good cooperation with the probation service and the municipal services already during the ser - ving of sentences. There is a particularly strong need to improve services to inmates during the release phase. Co- operation between the involved parties must start in good time before the transition from pri- son to freedom. Cooperation with voluntary or - ganisations such as WayBack is important during this phase. Drug programme under court control A system of suspended sentences with a drug programme under court control started in 2006 as a three-year trial scheme in Oslo and Bergen in order to offer convicted persons with drug or 9. Responses to social correlates and consequences 9.1 Social re-integration No new information available. 9.2 Prevention of drug-related crime 9.2.1 Assistance to drug users in prison There are many indications that services are less available to inmates with a drug or alcohol prob- lem than to others. The goal of the escalation plan for the drugs and alcohol field (the Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2008) is for more inmates with drug or alcohol problems to be giv- en an opportunity for better treatment and reha-bilitation while serving prison sentences or serv- ing sentences in other ways. This requires close cooperation between the prisons and the region-al health authorities, and between the prisons and the municipalities. The Ministry of Health and Care Services and the Ministry of Justice and the Police have pro-duced a circular that clarifies the responsibilities, tasks and coordination between the municipali- ties, the specialist health services and the Cor - rectional Services as regards inmates and convic- ted persons who are drug addicts/alcoholics. The circular is intended to improve and intensify co-operation and ensure follow-up and continuity in the services. Steps will be taken to ensure that relevant services arrive at good solutions for co- operation and joint plans at the regional and lo-cal level. The need for cohesion in services befo-re, during and after sentences are served means that special care services should not be develo- ped for persons in correctional service institu-tions.The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 46 In 2007, 56 personal assessments were carried out (64 in 2006). Of these, 28 were found to be suitable for such a sanction. During 2007, 21 ca- ses were concluded, one of which was disconti-nued because of death, 19 were discontinued be-cause of new criminality or breach of special conditions, and the last case was discontinued because the convicted person withdrew consent.

Through this scheme, experi-ence is being gained of inter-service cooperation on the follow-up of convicted persons. The trial scheme will be evaluated by SIRUS and then considered for continuation and expansion.Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 47 use of heroin. A project has been initiated with a view to estimating the hidden figures for how much heroin there actually is on the Norwegian market. The project will also include the collat-ing of interview data from interviews with in-jecting drug users in Oslo. The aim is for the project to be completed and a final report pro- duced by the end of February 2009. 10.2 Production, sources of supply and trafficking patterns Most of the amphetamine and methamphetamine on the Norwegian market comes from illegal laboratories in Russia, Poland and Lithuania. Lithuanian criminals have had a dominant role for several years as suppliers of synthetic drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and Rohypnol to Norway. Lithuania still has a central role, but the biggest quantities now come from the Netherlands and Poland. The main routes run through Germany and Denmark to the \u00d8re- sund Bridge and on through Sweden to Norway. Cars prepared with concealed cavities seems to be the most frequent method used. As before, cannabis mostly comes to Norway from Morocco via two main routes - from Spain and Italy up to the Netherlands/Germany and on to Denmark and Norway. The customs service has uncovered large quantities of cannabis in passenger cars and heavy goods vehicles. Ecstasy tablets that are sold in Norway are lar - gely produced at illegal laboratories in the Netherlands and Poland. The customs service makes most seizures in connection with drugs sent by post, while the biggest seizures are made from cars at Norway's borders. Heroin comes from Pakistan and Afghanistan via two northerly routes via Bulgaria/Romania - 10.1 Availability Various factors that influence the availability of drugs were discussed in NR 2007 Chapter 10.1. No new analyses have been carried out, but the situation in 2007/2008 is probably fairly similar. In the police's view, there are indications that co-caine, like amphetamine and methamphetamine, is being distributed and used more than before. In a historical frame of reference, the data show that the proportion of cocaine seizures in rela-tion to all other drugs has increased from ap- prox. 0.5 per cent to four per cent in ten years. However, the most striking development in 2007 was the large reduction in the amount of heroin seized. While the number of seizures increased somewhat after a steady decline during the last six to seven years, much less heroin was seized in 2007 than in the preceding years, eight kilos - compared with 93 kilos in 2006. Even though the quantity seized is a less reliable indicator of pre-valence than the number of seizures, which is il- lustrated by the fact that the quantities have va- ried a great deal in recent years, it is nonetheless the case that so little heroin has not been seized since 1990. The reduction does not reflect availa- bility to the same extent. The price level has re-mained more or less unchanged, and no reports have been received of a heroin drought of any length. The low seizure figures for 2007 raise three questions that have yet to be answered: Has the supply of heroin to Norway been reduced? Is the regular use of heroin based on previously imported supplies? Is heroin being imported via entirely new routes and/or using new techniques? The Customs Service has initiated cooperation with SIRUS with a view to obtaining a broader analysis of the drugs market with respect to the 10. Drug marketsThe Drug Situation in Norway 2008 48 Main features of the drug statistics for 2007 In 2007, 20,419 drug cases were registered and 24,139 seizures made. The total number of cases and drug seizures thus declined slightly com- pared with 2006, but there are big differences be-tween the different types of drugs. Such large quantities of amphetamine, methamp- hetamine and khat have never been seized in Norway before, 556.7 kg amphetamine and met-hamphetamine and more than 7.7 tonnes of khat. Moreover, 95 kg of cocaine were seized in 886 seizures. Both the quantity seized and the num- ber of seizures indicate that the use and availabi-lity of cocaine is on the increase. Large seizures were also made of ecstasy (79,133 tablets) and benzodiazepines (708,293 tablets), while only modest quantities of cannabis (842 kg) and doping substances (343,000 units) were seized. The amount of heroin seized in 2007 was only 8.1 kg. Seizures of heroin only accounted for ap- proximately five per cent of the total number of seizures in Norway. By comparison, this propor - tion in 1998 was as high as 20 per cent. While both the number of seizures and amount of cannabis seized declined, the cultivation of can-nabis plants was uncovered on an extensive scale. During the last six months of 2007, the police un- covered a large number of \u00abplantations\u00bb in rented houses, particularly in Eastern Norway. The vast majority of the \u00abgardeners\u00bb, and probably also the ringleaders, are of Vietnamese origin. Tendencies during the first six months of 2008 Large quantities of hash have been seized. Four hundred and one kilos were seized in one sei-zure, the third biggest ever made in Norway. The large seizures involve hash that is probably pro- duced in North Africa. As regards the number of seizures, it is primarily cannabis plants and mar - ijuana that have increased substantially.Ukraine/Russia, and then on to Poland /Lithua-nia. Two southerly routes go through Greece/the Balkans to the Netherlands/Germany. From the- re, consignments destined for Norway are sto-wed in hand luggage or passenger cars with con-cealed cavities. As before, cocaine comes from South America to Africa and Spain and from there to the Nether - lands and Germany before continuing up through Denmark to Norway. Substantial quanti- ties are also smuggled by airline passengers who arrive at European airports direct from South America. The cocaine is smuggled on to Norway in many ways. The Norwegian customs service recently experienced a growing wave of couriers smuggling drugs inside their bodies at Norwegi- an airports. Khat is transported from production areas in Africa to Europe. The drug is smuggled on to Norway from the Netherlands and the UK by plane and car. Most of the seizures are made from airline passengers who arrive from airports in the Netherlands and the UK. However, the biggest quantities are transported by road via Denmark and Sweden (the customs service, per - sonal communication). 10.3 Seizures The data basis The annual report from the National Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos) about status and developments in drug trafficking contains na- tional statistics that include all seizures by the police, the customs service, the prisons and the Armed Forces. Two variables are always reported - the quantity seized and the number of seizures. The data are based on verified analysis results for use in ordinary criminal cases, as well as on in-formation from the police districts when the drug offences are decided locally by writs with the option of a fine (destruction cases).Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 49 market share of each drug based on the number of seizures.

Despite the small quantitites, the number of sei-zures increased slightly compared with the two preceding years. The number of seizures, 4,222, increased slightly in 2007 after several years of steady decline. However, the number of seizures is only half the number in 2001. There are big For amphetamine and methamphetamine, both the quantities seized and the number of seizures remain high. The most striking seizure was of 112.3 kilos, the biggest single seizure ever made. Kripos has no evidence to indicate that the im- portation and distribution of amphetamine and methamphetamine has changed, and Norway is still seen as a substantial market for these two drugs in the European context. On the basis of the seizure figures, Kripos has no grounds for supposing that there has been a re- duction in the importation and use of cocaine. For heroin, the situation has changed since 2007 in that several large seizures have been made and the number of seizures is again increasing. 10.3.1 Seizures and purity of different types of drugs See the data in Standard Tables 13, 14 and 15. Table 8 shows the total number of seizures by the police, the customs service, prisons and the Ar - med Forces in 2007 broken down by the most common types of drugs. It also shows develop-ments in recent years and the percentage change since 2005. The pie chart below illustrates the Table 8: Number of seizures in the period 2001-2007 broken down by type of drugs*.

Source: KriposThe Drug Situation in Norway 2008 50 kg of which was seized in the last six months of the year alone. For hash, the average THC purity is around se- ven per cent as it has been for many years. The results of measurements vary greatly, however. Based on the high number of hash seizures here in Norway, there are therefore no grounds for claiming that the THC content in all types of hash seizures has changed significantly on av- erage. Based on the analyses carried out of can- nabis products in recent years, it is only in some of the cultivation cases that the top shoots of cannabis plants have had high, and sometimes unusually high, THC values. Amphetamine/methamphetamine Record amounts of amphetamine and metham-phetamine were seized in 2007, and 2006 is the only year in which more seizures were made than in 2007. A total of 559.4 kg were seized in 5,506 seizures. Preliminary analyses show that the to-tal seizures consist of 392 kg of amphetamine and 167 kg of methamphetamine. For both sub- stances, the amounts are greater than the year before. Based on the number of seizures, the pro-portion of methamphetamine is increasing sub- stantially in relation to amphetamine. It was ap- prox. 35 per cent in 2007. Table 9 shows developments in the last ten years. All the police districts have made seizures of both amphetamine and methamphetamine. Six districts made more seizures than in 2006. The average purity in 2007 is estimated to be roughly 38 per cent for amphetamine and 44 per cent for methamphetamine. This is somewhat lo- wer than registered in recent years.variations between the police districts. Heroin was seized in 24 of the country's 27 police dis- tricts and, in 14 of the districts, more seizures were made than in 2006. The average purity of the heroin has increased from 26 per cent to 36 per cent in two years, but there are big variations from seizure to seizure. Paracetamol and caffeine, as well as other intoxi- cating substances (benzodiazepines), are also found in very many seizures. Cannabis Since 2006, the amount of cannabis seized has been almost halved and the number of seizures has been reduced by 11 per cent. The decline in the number of seizures and quantities seized ap-plies to the big towns and cities in particular. Even though the decline is relatively large for the country as a whole, nine police districts have made more seizures than the year before. It is a striking development in 2007 that the propor - tion of marijuana and cannabis plants has in-creased, both as regards the amount and the number of seizures, in relation to hash. The amount of cannabis seized in 2007 was 863.9 kilos. The amount consists of approx. 668 kg of hash (77%), 76 kg of marijuana (9%), 119.9 kg of cannabis plants (14%) and 0.013 of cannabis extract. Of the total number of cannabis seizures (9,964), hash accounted for four-fifths. The reduction in the number of seizures from 2006 is more than 17 per cent. As regards marihuana and cannabis plants, on the other hand, there was an increase of 29 per cent. In terms of quantities, the seizures amounted to approx. 140 kilos, as much as 119 Table 9: Proportion of seizures of methamphetamine in relation to amphetamine 1998-2007. Percentages. Year 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 51 Apart from seven minor seizures of tablets con- taining amphetamine and equipped with an ecstasy logo, no other hallucinogenic, synthetic substances often mentioned together with ecsta-sy were found in 2007. However, 0.86 grams of a powder containing 2C-B was found in four sei- zures, and on one occasion MDEA was found of which have been identified previously, were registered in any sei- zures in 2007. On the other hand, ketamine (4.6 grams) was found in two seizures. However, this substance, which is an ingredient in the Norwe- gian-registered medicinal drug Ketalar, is not in-cluded on the list of narcotic substances. Benzodiazepines (BZD) More than 730,000 seized tablets in 4,084 sei-zures show that this class of medicinal drugs has in no way disappeared from the illicit market, even though the number of seizures has been halved in relation to the peak year of 2002. Dur - ing the period 2001 to 2003, it was primarily Ro-hypnol that dominated this class of substances with more than 6,500 seizures, while the figure five years later has fallen to roughly 800 seizures. Based on the number of seizures parameter, it is diazepam that is increasing its \u00abmarket share\u00bb at the expense of flunitrazepam. Rohypnol and Flu- nipam were reclassified from class B to class A drugs with effect from 1 January 2003, and Ro-hypnol was de-registered as a medicinal drug in Norway on 1 August 2004. All the Rohypnol sei-zures must therefore come from illegal import. Other BZD substances Other benzodiazepines that can be mentioned in-clude fenazepam, a benzodiazepine from Russia that is not in medical use in Norway. Even though this drug has never been very common in Nor - way, it has nevertheless attracted a lot of attention. The substance was first seized in 1993 in a small seizure in Finnmark. There were no more seizures until 2003. In recent years, the prevalence of fenazepam appears to have been on the decline. A total of 2,030 tablets were seized in 2007.Cocaine Nine hundred and eight seizures of cocaine were made in 2007, the highest number of seizures of cocaine ever made in Norway. With the exception of the years 1998 and 2005, when very large quan-tities of cocaine were seized that were not intend-ed for the Norwegian market, 2007 was also a re- cord year in terms of the amount seized, 95 kg. Cocaine was seized in 26 of the country's 27 police districts and 16 police districts made more seizu- res than the year before. Oslo's share of the cocaine seizures has been reduced from 62 per cent to 36 per cent over the last 11 years, while the rest of the country's share has naturally increased. Kripos does not distinguish as a matter of routi- ne between cocaine hydrochloride and cocaine base (\u00abcrack\u00bb). In 2007, however, one seizure was made of 482 grams of a mixture of substan-ces containing cocaine base (33-37%). The cocaine content in the seizures has fallen stead- ily, from more than 70 per cent 10 years ago to 38 per cent in 2006 and 2007. Cocaine hydrochloride of up to 100 per cent purity was seized also in 2007. Fenacetine is often used as an additive. Ecstasy In 2007, nearly 79,000 tablets were seized in 421 seizures. It is only in 2002 and 2003 that larger amounts of ecstasy have been seized than in 2007. The number of seizures, on the other hand, re-mains stable. As described in previous years, it ap-pears that the illegal traffic in ecstasy culminated at the turn of the millennium. However, as the sei- zures show, ecstasy has not disappeared from the market. The number of seizures, however, indi-cates that ecstasy's market share is no greater than it has been for this class of substances in recent years. The high number of tablets seized is ex-plained by two large seizures. Historically, they rank as the second and fifth biggest seizures ever. No other substances than MDMA were found in the seizures in 2007.The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 52 edly higher than the year before. However, only 13 police districts (out of 27) made seizures of khat. LSD Based on the figures for the number of seizures, LSD does not appear to have become more wide-ly available in 2007. The opposite would actually appear to be case. Since LSD is easy to conceal, however, we cannot discount the possibility that the seizure statistics do not truly reflect the situ-ation.Table 12: Amounts seized of GHB, GBL and 1.4 2004 Khat is included on the Norwegian list of narcotic substances. A total of 7.747 kilos of khat was seized in 2007 in 376 seizures. This is a much larger amount and the number of seizures is also mark-Table 11: Seizures of GHB, GBL and 1.4 butandiol 1998-2007.

Number of tablets/units and percentage. Drug 2,200 tablets Source: KriposPainkillers, drug-classified medicinal drugs A total of 17,354 tablets were seized in 959 sei- zures. The number of seizures has thus declined somewhat, while the amount seized remains rel- atively stable compared with recent years. Several of the cases involved illegal import of such me-dicinal drugs via internet shopping, but the num-ber of tablets in each seizure is relatively small. Based on the number of seizures, buprenorphine (Temgesic and Subutex) predominates, although the quantities seized are generally small. More tablets containing codeine were seized than any other substance. GHB Fifty-eight litres of GHB were seized in 163 sei-zures in 2007. The number of seizures of GHB increased radically in 2007. Even if we include seizures of the industrial chemicals GBL and 1.4-butandiol, substances that are not included on the list of narcotic substances, the figures are nonetheless deemed to be small compared with other depressants.Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 53 10.4 Prices See the data in Standard Table 16. A new 'pricelist' for narcotic substances is availa- ble as of October 2008. The list has been produ-ced by Oslo police district on the basis of infor - mation from internal police sources. Naturally, the prices on the illegal street market must be treated with considerable caution and should preferably also be checked against sources outsi-de the police. Moreover, as regards large quanti- ties, the variation in prices is particularly great for several of the types of drugs. For smaller quantities, the price level seems to have largely remained stable for most of the ty-pes of drugs since the last overview produced by the police in autumn 2006. In nominal terms, prices have probably fallen slightly rather than the opposite. The most striking development is that the price of cocaine appears to have fallen for typical sales doses. In 2006, the price for half a gram of cocaine was estimated to be approxi- mately EUR 62.5 11 (NOK 500), while in 2008 it was approximately EUR 37.5 - 50 (NOK 300-400). By comparison, the market price for heroin in 2008 was estimated to be EUR 62.5 (NOK 500) for 0.5 grams and EUR 25 - 37.5 (NOK 200-300) for 0.2 grams. Cocaine is still expensive in relation to amphetamine. The price level for one gram is more than double the price level for amphetamine, and the differences seem to be even greater for large quantities. The prices for ecstasy, GHB and LSD seem stable, while the price level for Rohypnol (per tablet, 100 mg) on the illegal market seems to have fallen since 2006. 11 Conversion rate: 1 EUR=NOK 8.00Other hallucinogenic drugs Two hallucinogenic drugs were found for the first time in 2007, but neither of them is on the list of narcotic substances. One of them is bro- mo-dragonfly. This substance was seized in very small quantities of one gram/five doses and 0.6 grams/three doses, respectively. The other sub- stance found was 3,4-methylenedioxymethcathi - none or methylone in the form of 2.6 grams of powder. Psychoactive plants and plant parts that are not classified as drugs are regularly seized on the grounds that their importation is not normally permitted. Much of this traffic is probably the re- sult of information and offers on the internet. Kripos has noted in particular seeds of Argyreia peyote containing mescaline. In 2005, tablets appeared containing the synthe- tic substance 1.3-chlorphenyl piperazine, a hallu- cinogenic that is also called mCCP . The substan-ce, which is not yet on the list of narcotic substances, has no industrial or medicinal appli- cation. The largest single seizure was made in Oslo in 2005, and consisted of 10,030 tablets to-gether with 20 kilos of amphetamine. The distri- bution of this drug has clearly been in Southern and Western Norway. All the tablets seized had the same appearance and logo as traditional ecstasy tablets.PART B Selected issueThe Drug Situation in Norway 2008 56 In principle, the police are not entitled to decide a case, although informal warnings are probably used in some relatively trivial cases. However, the lower prosecuting authority is integrated with the police. Lawyers are employed at all the police stations in the country who, in addition to ordinary police duties, are also authorised to take certain decisions regarding prosecution in minor cases, including waiving prosecution, issuing writs with the option of a fine, referring to a hea- ring by a mediation board or bringing charges before the courts. In the exercise of their duties as prosecutors, however, they are subject to the Director General of Public Prosecutions, not the Ministry of Justice and the Police. If the prosecuting authorities bring a case before the courts, a number of different penal sanctions can be imposed. A person found guilty can be sentenced to pay a fine or to a prison sentence, which can either be unconditional or suspended on condition that the person in question com- plies with certain conditions during a stipulated probationary period. Fines and prison sentences can be combined. A court can also sentence the offender to a community sentence, which means that the offender must perform certain tasks for a certain number of hours for the community. In the case of serious crimes, the offender can be sentenced to preventive detention if there is high risk of the person in question committing new, serious crimes. In cases that involve drug crimes, it can be set as a condition for both a waiver of prosecution and a suspended sentence that the offender in ques- tion refrains from using alcohol or other intoxi- cating or narcotic substances, or undergoes tre-atment to combat the use of such substances, in an institution if necessary. This latter condition is rarely used since it is deemed to be an inter - vention by the court in the area of responsibility of the treatment sector. Normally, such a condi-11.1 Options available in the country - penal sanctions in Norway 11.1.1 The general system of sanctions The question of which penal sanctions are to be used in criminal cases in Norway is initially de-cided by the prosecuting authorities. Instead of prosecuting an offender in the courts, the prose- cuting authority can conclude the case on its own. One option is waiver of criminal charges, which means that the prosecuting authority waives prosecution on condition that the offend- er in question does not reoffend during a proba- tionary period of two years and meets any other requirements set by the prosecuting authority. The prosecuting authorities can also issue a writ with the option of a fine, which means that the offender can choose to accept the stipulated fine instead of having his or her case tried in the courts. Waiver of criminal charges was previous- ly frequently used in less serious cases, but it is used relatively rarely today, also in drug cases. Instead, the use of writs with the option of a fine has increased strongly. The prosecuting authorities also have the option of referring a case to a mediation board. This is the only form of \u00abdiversion\u00bb in Norwegian law. Referral to a mediation board means that the prosecuting authority - or, if applicable, the co-urt as a condition for a suspended sentence - can transfer the case to a mediation board at which the offender and the victim meet and, if possible, agree on how the conflict between them can be resolved. Hearings by mediation boards are used in minor cases in particular, often when young offenders are involved. However, in cases where there is no victim, as in the case of driving under the influence of drugs or illegal association with drugs, a hearing by a mediation board will rarely be an option.11. Sentencing statistics - NorwayAnnual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 57 spects. If a small quantity is involved, the offence is punishable by fines or imprisonment for up to two years. Aggravated drug crimes include the three other degrees of gravity. If a somewhat larger quantity is involved, the offence is punish-able by imprisonment for up to ten years; if a substantial quantity is involved, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for between three and 15 years, and under particularly aggravating circumstances the punishment can be up to 21 years' imprisonment, which is the maximum punishment under Norwegian criminal law after the repeal of life imprisonment in 1981. This means that drug crimes - except for driving a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs - fall into one of five categories of gravity: 1 The Act relating to medicines section 24: The use and possession of drugs (for own use). Fines or imprisonment for up to two years. 2 The General Civil Penal Code section 162 first paragraph: Drug crimes Fines or imprisonment for up to two years. 3 The General Civil Penal Code section 162 second paragraph: Aggravated drug crimes. Imprisonment for up to ten years. 4 The General Civil Penal Code section 162 third paragraph first sentence: Aggravated drug crimes that involve a large quantity. Imprisonment for between three and 15 years. 5 The General Civil Penal Code section 162 third paragraph second sentence: Aggravated drug crimes that involve a very large quantity and where there are other particularly aggravating circumstances. The General Civil Penal Code does not contain any provisions specifying what drugs or what quantities are required for the different punish- ment alternatives to be applicable, or what other circumstances are to be given weight. In a circu-lar from the Director General of Public Prosecu-tions (Circular 1/1998 part II - Drug cases: The importance of quantity in the legal assessment and use of writs with the option of a fine), how-ever, instructions are given for when the prose- cuting authority shall decide cases by writs with tion will only be set if the person in question is already in treatment or has already been granted admission to a treatment institution at the time the decision to waive prosecution was made or the judgment was handed down. If the court finds that a suspended sentence cannot be impo- sed, it will be possible to reduce the length of the prison sentence in many cases if the offender is a drug user who, since the offence, has started tre-atment or has been assigned a place in a treat- ment institution. Through an amendment of the law in 1995, a sc- heme was introduced whereby it is possible to impose a suspended sentence on persons with alcohol problems who are convicted of driving under the influence on condition that they un- dergo an approved alcohol treatment program- me under supervision of the Correctional Servi-ces. In 2005, a trial scheme was introduced in the two biggest cities in Norway consisting of a drug programme for drug users who have been con- victed of drug-related crimes, but this is not li-mited to driving under the influence of drugs. Treatment in an institution can also be included as part of the programme. The programmes are administered by the probationary service, which is also responsible for following up the convicted offender. 11.1.2. Penal provisions for drug crimes Minor drug offences that involve the use or pos- session of drugs are punished pursuant to the Act relating to medicines (Act No 132 of 4 De-cember 1992) section 24, for which the maxi-mum sentence is up to two years' imprisonment. Other drug crimes are punishable pursuant to section 162 of the General Civil Penal Code (Act No 10 of 22 May 1902 with subsequent amend-ments). The General Civil Penal Code section 162 covers all kinds of association with drugs other than use and possession for own use, such as the manufacture, importation, exportation, acquisition, storage, sending or conveying of drugs. However, the General Civil Penal Code section 162 distinguishes between four degrees of gravity depending on the drug and amount in- volved and the nature of the offence in other re-The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 58 11.1.3. Penal provisions for driving under the influence of drugs In Norway, the first penal provisions for driving motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol were introduced in the early 1900s. In 1936, a fixed limit for the blood alcohol level of 0.5 mg/ ml (which in 1988 was lowered to 0.2 mg/ml) was introduced, and the right to take blood sam- ples was also introduced at the same time. Until 1959, the law only applied to driving under the influence of alcohol, but from then the prohibi-tion was extended to also cover the influence of \u00abother intoxicating or narcotic substances\u00bb, and the right to take blood samples was also extend-ed to such cases. However, the prohibition against driving a mo- tor vehicle under the influence of other substan-ces than alcohol was virtually a dormant provi- sion for many years. Only in exceptional cases were blood samples examined with a view to establishing whether the driver had used sub-stances other than alcohol, and in the event that such substances were found, there was great un- certainty in case law about whether the driver could be described as being under the influence. The result was that hardly anyone was prosecu- ted for driving under the influence of substances other than alcohol. In 1958, the police were given the right to use a so-called breathalyser test on suspected drivers of motor vehicles with a view to establishing whether there was alcohol in their exhaled bre- ath and thus grounds for taking a blood sample of the driver to establish guilt. However, drivers were not obliged to take such tests. Through an amendment of the law in 1981, however, the po- lice were given the right to carry out breathalyser tests of drivers as a matter of routine in connec-tion with road accidents, on suspicion of certain road traffic offences and in connection with or - dinary road traffic controls. In 1988, a fixed limit was also introduced for punishable alcohol con-tent in exhaled air. Because sufficiently reliable measuring instruments were not available, however, breathalyser tests were first seriously the option of a fine or which sentencing claims are to be entered in drug cases that are heard in the courts. In the circular, it is stipulated that in cases involving possession and storage where the aim is not resale, it shall be possible to issue writs with the option of a fine if the quantity does not exceed one to two user doses of heroin, amphet- amine, cocaine or LSD, five grams of cannabis - increased to 15 grams in 2006 - five kilos of khat, one to two ecstasy tablets or 25 to 30 tablets con- taining benzodiazepine. If the case involves importation or distribution or exceeds these limits, the case must be brought to court. In such cases a claim shall be entered for punishment for a drug crime pursuant to the General Civil Penal Code section 162 first para- graph if the case involves up to 15 grams of co- caine or amphetamine, 350 ecstasy tablets or one kilo of cannabis. If larger quantities than this are involved, a claim shall be entered for punishment for an aggrava-ted drug crime pursuant to the General Civil Pe-nal Code section 162 second paragraph if the case involves between approx. 15 and 750 grams of heroin, between approx. 50 grams and three kilos of amphetamine and cocaine, between ap- prox. 350 and 15,000 user doses of LSD and ecstasy, or between approx. one and 80 kilos of cannabis. If the quantity is even greater, a claim shall be entered for punishment pursuant to the General Civil Penal Code section 162 third para- graph first sentence. Punishment pursuant to section 162 third paragraph second sentence re-quires that further aggravating circumstances are present. Although the claims entered by the prosecuting authorities are not binding on the court, the sen- tence will often not deviate much from the claim. This is due, not least, to the fact that the claim in an individual case - and the instructions in the Director General of Public Prosecutions' circular - are largely based on case law from the Supreme Court, which has precedential effect and is the-refore largely followed by the lower courts.Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 59 Pursuant to section 31, the punishment for dri- ving under the influence of alcohol varies with the degree of influence: a fine and a suspended prison sentence for a blood alcohol level of less than 1.0 mg/ml, a fine and a suspended or unconditional prison sentence for a blood alcohol level of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/ml, and a fine and unconditional prison sentence if the blood alcohol level is over 1.5 mg/ml. Pursuant to the directions from the Storting and the Ministry of Justice and the Police, the fine should normally be equivalent to one and a half months' gross income. For driving under the in-fluence of substances other than alcohol, the pu- nishment shall also vary in the same way, but be- cause there are no corresponding units of measurement that can be used, the decision is left to the discretion of the court. 11.2. Data collection systems 11.2.1. Crime statistics Data about crimes are published in annual crime statistics prepared by Statistics Norway (SSB). The statistics are first published on SSB's website (www.ssb.no/emner/03/05) and then published as an annual printed publication (Crime Statis-tics), which also contains an English text. Both Norwegian and English are used on the website and in the printed version. The crime statistics are available on the website one to two years, and in printed form two to three years, after the re- porting year. The crime statistics consist of police statistics that include all registered offences and those charged in these cases, sanctions statistics that provide information about the penal sanctions imposed and, finally, imprisonment statistics that provide information about the prison popu- lation. The police statistics are based on the police's central registration system in which all offences are registered, also if they have been committed by the same accused person. The sanctions statistics are based on the central cri- minal record and police information system (SSP), which provides information about which introduced as proof of being under the influence of alcohol with effect from 1996. While breathalyser tests were initially only used to a modest extent, their use increased as the 1980s progressed. Even if the influence of sub-stances other than alcohol could not be detected by such breathalyser tests, it could be indicated indirectly. If a driver appeared to be under the influence despite the breathalyser showing that he or she was not under the influence of alcohol, this could indicate that he or she was under the influence of other substances. In such case, the police could ensure that a blood sample was ta- ken and that it was specially analysed with a view to establishing whether the person in question was under the influence of substances other than alcohol. Moreover, a gradual development took place on both the technical and methodological level as regards the chemical analyses that were carried out to establish the presence other such substances. This gradually resulted in a strong increase in the number of blood samples sent for so-called extended analysis, in which the sample is also analysed with a view to establishing the influence of substances other than alcohol. However, saliva samples with a view to establish- ing whether a driver has used other substances are still not used by the police. 12 The current penal provisions concerning driving under the influence of alcohol or other intoxica- ting or narcotic substances are found in the Road Traffic Act sections 22 and 31. Pursuant to secti-on 22, a driver of a motor vehicle shall be deemed to be under the influence in the sense of the Act if his or her blood alcohol level is over 0.2 mg/ml or more than 0.1 mg alcohol per litre air in exha- led breath. As regards influence from other sub-stances, on the other hand, there are no fixed li- mits - it is up to the courts to decide whether a driver shall be deemed to have been under the influence, often by obtaining a written or oral statement from an expert. 12 A comprehensive test project on saliva samples was carried out in Norway in 2005/2006. www.fhi.no The Drug Situation in Norway 2008 60 sentences. The different personal data at the dif- ferent stages of a case are presented in Table 13. It is not possible on the basis of the crime statis- tics to trace the same person through the diffe- rent stages in the criminal law process. Moreover, registration is linked to the section or sections of the Penal Code that have been violated, with no additional description of the offence. This means that as regards, for example, drug offences, there is no information about which drugs and which forms of unlawful association with drugs are in- volved, and, in the case of driving under the in- fluence, there is no information about whether the person in question was under the influence of alcohol or another substance. 11.4 Results available 11.4.1 Statistics for drug crimes In 2005, which is the last year for which such sta- tistics are available, a total of 39,634 drug cases were investigated. Of this total, 4,487 cases were dropped as unsolved or because the perpetrator could not be held criminally liable because of his or her age or because of absconding. How the re-maining 35,084 cases were decided is shown in Table 14.sanctions have been imposed on those who have been given penal sanctions. The imprisonment statistics provide information about the prison population as of 1 January in the statistical year, and admissions to and departures from prisons during the year, and they are based on SSP , sup-plemented by information from the Correctional Services' registration system. 11.3 Data collected In addition to the primary offence of which they have been found guilty, the information relating to persons in the crime statistics - i.e. persons charged, sentenced and the prison population - includes the primary offence they have been found guilty of, their gender and age, and for charged and sentenced persons, also their county of residence. For persons charged, additional in-formation is provided about the location where the crime was committed (county), the number of offences covered by the charge and the num- ber of accomplices, and whether the person in question had previous convictions during the last five years. For sentenced persons, informa- tion is provided about where the crime was com- mitted (county), nationality, the length of any prison sentence, the size of optional fines and imposed fines, in addition to the conditions set for waiving prosecution and suspended prison Table 13: Personal data at the different stages of a case Charged* Sentenced* Prison inmates* Number of offences Number of accomplicesPrevious convictions Age Age Age Gender Gender Gender Location of the offence (county) Location of the offence (county) Place of residence (county) Place of residence (county) Nationality Length of prison sentenceSize of fineConditions for conditional sanctions *For primary offence Source: SIRUSAnnual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 61 der the influence of alcohol or other substances. Of these cases, 1,122 cases were dropped as un- solved because the person in question had left the country, was a minor or could not be held criminally liable for other reasons. Of the re-maining 7,483 cases, 451 (6.0%) were decided by a writ with an option of fine and 192 (2.6%) by waiver of prosecution, while 6,840 (91.4%) were prosecuted as criminal cases before the courts. As mentioned, no information is available about how many of these cases involved driving under the influence of substances other than alcohol. The crime statistics do not distinguish between persons who are investigated for, charged with or sentenced for driving under the influence of al-In 2007, a total of 14,194 sanctions were imposed where a drug offence was the primary offence, and Table 15 shows the distribution of the differ - ent sanctions. Some of those convicted received a prison sentence where part of the sentence was suspended. They are included in the table under unconditional prison sentence. Moreover, some of the convicted persons in the table categorised under suspended or unconditional prison sen-tence were also sentenced to pay a fine. 11.4.2 Statistics for driving under the influence of drugs According to the police statistics for 2005, which is the last year for which we have data, 8,605 cas-es were investigated that concerned driving un- Table 14: Persons charged with drug offences 2005 General Civil Penal Code Medicines Act Aggravated drug crimeDrug crimePossession of drugsUse of drugsOther drug crimes No % No % No % No % No % Waiving of prosecution etc. 23 2.3 1,159 7.6 881 12 876 7.6 27 49.0 Writ with option of fine 1 0.1 3,758 24.7 3,488 47.6 5,029 43.6 20 36.4 Mediation board 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 Charge 995 97.6 10,283 67.7 2,961 40.4 5,627 48.8 15,201 100 7,330 100 11,534 100 55 100 Source: Statistics Norway, Crime Statistics Table 15: Penal sanctions for drug offences by type of sanction 2007 General Civil Penal Code Medicines Act Aggravated drug crimeDrug crimePossession of drugsUse of drugsOther drug crimes No % No % No % No % No % Waiver of prosecution 0 0 70 .0 28 1.1 99 2.5 1 16.7 Writ with option of fine 4 0.6 4,441 63.8 2,506 94.8 3,499 88.9 4 66.7 Fine by judgment 0 0 100 1.4 60 2.3 73 1.9 1 16.7 Community sentence 63 9.7 351 5.0 4 0.2 24 0.6 0 0 Suspended prison sentence20 3.1 1,172 16.8 25 0.9 86 2.2 0 0 Uncondition-al prison sentence561 86.6 826 11.9 20 0.8 6,960 99.9 2,643 100.1 3,937 100.1 6 100 Statistics Norway, Crime StatisticsThe Drug Situation in Norway 2008 62 and M\u00f8rland, 2006). This means that slightly more than a third of all the 7,483 persons punis- hed for driving under the influence in 2005 were under the influence of other substances, possibly in combination with alcohol. For those drivers of motor vehicles where other substances are found, either in an amount that means they are deemed to be under the influence or smaller amounts, the National Institute of Pu- blic Health provides an overview of which sub- stances are involved. In all, 25 substances or groups of substances are examined, and, in many of the tests, several different substances are found. In 2005, amphetamine was found in 1,343 blood samples, which is 32 per cent of all the 4,257 samples that were subjected to extended analysis, and methamphetamine was found in 509 samples (12%). Cannabis substances were found in 1,215 (29%) of the samples. As regards benzodiazepines, diazepam was found in 967 (23%) of the samples, clonazepam in 542 (13%), and other benzodia-zepines were also common. Of opiates, morphine was found in 270 (6%) of the samples, the meta- bolite of heroin in 117 (3%) and methadone in 197 (5%). Cocaine was found in 142 (3%) of the samples and ecstasy in 63 samples (1%).cohol and driving under the influence of other substances. However, there are data about sus- pected drivers who have been subjected to a blood test for alcohol and an extended blood test (possible supplemented by a urine test) which are compiled by the National Institute of Public Health. It is the only institute in Norway that analyses blood samples for use in such cases, and data from the analyses is published annually on the website www.fhi.n o and in the statistical pu- blication: Alcohol and Drugs in Norway (www.sirus.n o). According to these statistics, in 2005 a total of 2,243 drivers of motor vehicles were proven to have been under the influence of alcohol through tests of their exhaled breath, and a blood sample was therefore not taken. In addition, blood samples were taken of a total of 6,225 drivers suspected of driving under the influence of alco-hol or other substances, for 4,257 or 68 per cent of whom an extended analysis was carried out of the blood sample. There are no data about how many of these persons were found to be under the influence of substances other than alcohol, but estimates from the institute indicate that ap- proximately 2,500 to 3,000 persons per year are found guilty of driving under the influence of substances other than alcohol (Christophersen Annual report to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction - EMCDDA 63 Evalueringen av et pilotprosjekt Olsen H.,Skretting A.(2008): The Norwegian injecting room trial: politics and unge voksne Tidsskrift for den Chapter 3: Steinkjer, B.
