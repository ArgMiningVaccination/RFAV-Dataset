Article: Individuals in emotional dis tress are often treated with psychotherapeutic agents, but other treatment options exist (Hogan & Shattell, 2007). One safe and effective adjunct for the prevention and treatment of emotional distress is aromathera py (Field et al., 2005; Kuroda et al., 2005; Lemon, 2004) \u2014the therapeutic use of inhaled es sential oils. Aromatherapy is one of the fastest growing modalities in complementary and alterna tive medicine (CAM) in the United States (d'Angelo, 2002), but research on aromatherapy is relatively scant, and few nursing programs offer courses in aroma -therapy. This article describes the physiological effects of scent, reviews the research on aroma -therapy, presents practical infor mation on the use of clinical aro matherapy for emotional distress, and suggests resources for addi tional training and education. BACKGROUND The medicinal use of aromat ic oils extends back to ancient Egyptian and Chinese cultures (Lis-Balchin, 2006), but the term aromatherapy was coined by Rene -Maurice Gatteefosse, a French chemist who experimented with essential oils for wound healing during World War I (d'Angelo, 2002) . However, it was not until the 1980s that aromatherapy be gan to develop as a serious disci pline (Robins, 1999), when work on mind -body healing and the emerging field of psychoneuroim munology stimulated interest in the use of aromatherapy to allevi ate emotional and mental distress (d'Angelo, 2002). Aromatherapy is currently taught in French medical schools, prescribed by European physicians, reimbursed by many Eu ropean health insurers, and used in Japanese factories to enhance worker productivity and prevent the spread of airborne infectious diseases (Robins, 1999). Aroma -therapy is often not prescribed by traditional U.S. medical practi tioners; however, its use has in -creased among CAM and nursing practitioners (d'Angelo, 2002). PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF SCENT The sense of smell is crucial for survival in mammals. Human be ings have more than 1,000 differ ent genes that regulate the produc tion of specialized receptors in the nose (Buck, 2004). Each receptor cell is specific and ab le to detect only a few molecule odors. The responses to an odor are neuro logically transmit ted to the olfac tory bulb in the brain. There the information from several olfactory receptors is combined, forming a pat tern that is perceived as a dis tinct odor in multiple areas in the cerebral cortex and the limbic sys tem (Buck, 2004). Even though nasal receptors are quite specific, human beings are able to differen tiate up to 10,000 odors through a complex sensory -somatic cascade that instantaneously activates the autonomic nervous system, memory, and emotion through the amygdala and other limbic structures (Buck, 2004) Olfactory stimulation causes immediate physiological changes in blood pressure, muscle ten sion, pupil size, blink magnitude, skin temperature, skin blood flow, electrodermal activity, heart rate, brain wave patterns, and sleep/arousal states (Kuroda et al., 2005). Inhaled odors activate the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, endorphins, and norepinephrine in the hypotha lamic pituitary axis and modulate neuroreceptors in the immune system, altering mood, reduc ing anxiety, and interrupting the stress response (d'Angelo, 2002). The sense of smell is related to dai ly functions such as alert ness, relaxation, attention, perfor mance, and healing, and these may be mediated purposefully with di fferent aromas (Field et al., 2005). Lavender, for example, has been associated with parasympathetic stimulation of the auton omic ner vous system, leading to increased beta power and decreased conting ent negative variation on electro -encephalogram; these in turn are associated with decreased anxiety, improved mood, and increased sedation (Moss, Cook, Wesnes, & Duckett, 2003). Peppermint and rosemary have been associated with increased arousal, improved cognition and memory, and en hanced performance on cogni tive assessment tests (Moss et al., 2003). The parasympathetic -stimulating effects of lavender and the sympathetic -stimulating effects of rosemary have been shown to sig nificantly decrease salivary cortisol and increase free radical reactive scavenging activity, suggesting a protective effect on the body from oxidative stress, as well as possible anti - inflammatory, anti -aging, and anti-carcinogenic activity (Atsumi & Tonosaki, 2007). These findings on the physi ological effects of scent in human beings suggest a link to emotions and memory, both modulators of physical and mental health. The effect is immediate and works beyond the level of conscious awareness (Moss et al., 2003). Thus, certain aromas may be used to affect psychoneuroimmune functions to promote healing. RESEARCH ON AROMATHERAPY Aromatherapy studies have focused primarily on the physio logical and emotional arousal ef fects of essential oils, which can be inhaled, ingested, or applied topically. Much of the research has evaluated aromatherapy in conjunction with other mo dalities such as massage and reflex ology (Buckle, 2007; Louis & Kow alski, 2002). However, recent studies have sought to isolate the effects of aromatherapy as a stand - alone therapy. In a study of 73 healthy col lege students, different scents produced different mood states following administration of an anxiety -provoking task (Burnett, Solterbeck, & Strapp, 2004). Stu dents receiving inhaled rosemary scored significantly higher on measures of tension -anxiety and confusion -bewilderment than did those in lavender and control groups. Both rosemary and laven der were significantly associated with lower fatigue -inertia rat ings. The groups did not differ on physiological parameters. These results suggest differences in the effects of aromatic oils on mood, independent of physiologically measurable parameters. Evaluating the effect of aro matherapy on crisis management, Fowler (2006) found that 77% of a convenience sample of 43 ado lescents in a residential mental health facility asked for aroma -therapy when they felt agitated. Fowler used a blend of 3% ylang ylang, sweet marjoram, and berga mot in jojoba oil, either inhaled or topically applied using a modified hand massage technique. During the 3 -month study, the number of pha rmacological injections for agi tation decreased from 43 to 3 1, the number of ora l as needed medica tions for anxiety or agitation de -creased from 631 to 397, and the number of seclusion and restraint events decreased from 29 to 20. In a convenience sample of 200 adults awaiting dental procedures in Austria, those who received diffused ambient odors of orange or lavender while waiting had sig nificantly less anxiety and better mood than did those exposed to music or controls, even controlling for dental pain (Lehrn er, Marwins ki, Lehr, Johren, & Deecke, 2005). However, among a convenience sample of 118 patients awaiting endoscopy in a same -day surgery center in the United States, no significant difference in anxiety was found before and after laven der inhalation (Muzzarelli, Force, & Sebold, 2006). In this acute care setting, mean anxiety scores were extremely high both before and after the intervention, suggesting that aromatherapy may be better for moderate anxiety than for se vere anxiety. Even s o, the authors noted that anecdotal reports from patients who received aromathera py suggested continued use of this modality (Muzzarelli et al., 2006). Louis and Kowalski (2002) examined physiological and emotional parameters in a con venience sample of 17 terminally ill cancer patients following treat ment with humidified lavender. While physiological and psycho -logical scores improved in the predicted direction, the differ ences were not statistically signifi cant, perhaps because of the small sample. Interestingly, the patients' caregivers reported increases in their own relaxation and sense of well -being during the lavender aromatherapy treatments. Itai et al. (2000) compared the effects of lavender, hiba oil, and odorless conditions on depression and anxiety in a group of 14 hemo dialysis patients. Hiba oil signifi cantly decreased mean scores on both anxiety and depression, and lavender significantly decreased mean anxiety scores. The find ings were significant in dependent of personality traits, psychologi cal status, and psychotherapeutic medication for anxiety and sleep. Lemon (2004) studied the effects of nine essential oils on anxiety and depression in 32 acute care psychiatric patients. The study compared levels of de pression and anxiety in a control g roup receiving massage with car rier oil and an experimental group receiving essential oils diluted in carrier oil during massage. The group receiving massage with es sential oils showed s ignificantly more improvement in scores on depression, anxiety, and severity of emotional symptoms than did those receiving massage alone. Clearly, the research contin ues to show mixed findings on the efficacy of aromatherapy. This may be due, in part, to study limitations, such as small and convenience samples, one -time or short -term interventions, and methodological issues. However, even in those studies in which aromatherapy interventions failed to achieve statistically signi ficant improvements, continued use and study of this modality were en couraged by the researchers and participants (Louis & Kowalski, 2002 ; Muzzarelli et al., 2006). Sig nificant improvements were most common in studies in which the aromatherapy was tailor ed to the client by an experienced and ho listically trained aromatherapist (Itai et al., 2000; Lemon, 2004). Buckle (2007) reported clinically significant findings even in the absence of statistical significance in many studies and noted that institutional aromatherapy pro -grams have been implemented for relaxation, emotional well - being, and agitation. USE OF CLINICAL AROMATHERAPY Essential Oils to Relieve Emotional Distress Essential oils can be applied in several ways. They can be added to a carrier, such as a vegetable oil or unscented lotion, and then applied to the skin, or they can be added to bath salts, room sprays, or diffusers for inhalation. Howe ver, the most effective applica tion route for decreasing anxiety and slowing an overactive mind is inhalation. Using a small blank inhaler tube, essential oils are added to a piece of cotton that is inserted into the tube. The oil is then available to smell. Oils used by aromatherapists to reduce anxiety, improve mood, and reduce stress include (d'Angelo, 2002; Lis-Balchin, The effects and dosing of these nine essential oils are shown in Table 1. Data on each of these oils, inclu ding uses, side effects, precau tions, chemical and botanical in formation, and potential interac tions can be found in Lis -Balchin's (2006) aromatherapy text. Buying and Storing Essential Oils Adulterated oils or oils that are synthetic and called fragrance or perfume oils will not offer the same therapeutic effects as pure plant -extracted oils, and they may actually cause allergies, headaches, and chemical sen sitivities. Gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) are methods of separating compounds in essential oils into individual components and iden tifying major components in the oil. These processes are used to identify any adulteration of an essential oil, which means the oil has had chemicals or other sub stances added or removed. GC/ MS testing is also used to identify the exact chemical profile of an oil and assess its potential thera peutic uses. The breakdown of chemical components in individ ual oils is important because some of the therapeutic benefits of oils are determined by their chemi cal makeup. Reports of chemical components should be available to the buyer on request. Factors that cause oxidation of essential oils include exposure to oxygen, heat, and light. Stor age affects the shelf life of essen tial oils. When stored properly, their oxidation rate slows signifi cantly. The potential for allergic reactions and skin irritation from essential oils increases when es sential oils oxidize. Ideally, oils should be sto red in a dark, cool room. Bottles should be dark -colored glass. Shelf life can range from 1 to 8 years, depending on the chemical makeup of the oil and the storage conditions. Han dling of oils and possible problems in storage conditions are reduced when t here is only one company between distiller and customer, so it is best to purchase essential oils from a company that buys directly from a distiller. Precautions Like all medicinal products, es sential oils can be toxic or incom patible with other compounds or treatments, or they can produce side effects or cause allergic reac tions (Lis -Balchin, 2006). When recomme nding a therapeutic regi men of essential oils for a client, the appropriate dosin g, the route of administration, and the client's size, health status, and individual preferences should be taken into account (d'Angelo, 2002). Side effects can include exacerbation of asthma or respiratory disorders due to allergen load, and with topical application, contact der matit is or irritation. Also, particu lar odors may be unpleasant or irritating to clients. Some oils, such as bergamot or lemon, may cause photosen sitivity. This can be avoided by limiting sun and ultraviolet light exposu re for 12 hours af ter use (d'Angelo, 2002). Just as with allopathic medications, certain oils are contraindicated in certain health conditions, including epilepsy (lavender, rosemary), hypertension (rose mary), asthma (rosemary), and pregnancy (lemon balm). Prac titioners must practice in an ethical and safe manner based on professional aromatherapy and nursing guidelines (Buckle, 2003; d'Angelo, 2002). AROMATHERAPY EDUCATION Safe use of essential oils re quires an understanding of bot any, biochemistry, physiology, and essential oil therapeutics, includ ing dosing, administration, toxic ity, interactions, and side effects (Buckle, 2003). Essential oils can be used by nurses, but advanced training should be obtained be fore clinical use. Continuing educ ation programs in aromatherapy can be found through t he Ameri can Holistic Nurses Association (AHNA) and the National As sociation for Holistic Aroma therapy (NAHA). A list of these programs is provided in Table 2. Cours es to obtain certification in aromatherapy are also available. The NAHA (2005) has is -sued national educational stan dards for aromatherapy certifica tion. To be certified through the NAHA, an aromatherapist must have 200 hours of training from an approved school, which in cludes courses in the chemistry , botany, and anatomy and physi ology of aromatherapy; the use of essential oils; extraction ods; oil quality and absorption; carrier oils; blending techniques; methods of application; clinic al therapeutics; and ethics. Aroma -therapy texts (Buckle, 2003; Lis -Balchin, 2006) and a variety of Internet resources available from AHNA and NAHA may also be helpful to nurses interested in using aromatherapy. CONCLUSION Clinical aromatherapy shows promise as a safe alternative or complement to traditional health care interventions to relieve stress, reduce anxiety, and im prove mood; however, more re search is needed. Suggestions for future research include interven tion studies that isolate the effects of particular oils and combina tions of oils on mood, memory, and sense of well -being; replica tion studies using rigorous study designs and appropriate sample sizes; studies on the use of aro matherapy in various popu lations (i.e., children, older adults, ethnic or cultural groups); and studies that combine aromatherapy with guided imagery, meditation, or hypnosis to augment the manage ment of emotional distress. The accessibility, low cost, and low side effect profile make aromatherapy attractive for man -aging emotional distress. In ad dition, its wide adaptability and ease of use make it easy to tailor to diverse inpatient and outpa tient settings. Effective use re quires adequate knowledge and skill s and the ability to safely tai lor interventions to the unique needs of each client. The art of nursing requires a balanced and integrative approach to healing. Aromatherapy is a healing prac tice that blends the \"essenc e\" of science with the holism inherent in the art of nursing.
