Such services shall maintain a high standard of qua lity and shall be provided within the limitations and exclusions hereinafter specified. All providers participating in the Medicaid progr am must furnish services in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Medicaid program . Conditions of participation are available from Provider Services. This Chapter describes covered services, se rvice limitations, and general reimbursement methodology. This manual obsoletes all previous policy and procedure manuals, bulletins and policy news. All Medicaid policies and requirements (such as prior authorizations, etc.) are the same for Nevada Check Up, with the exception of the f our areas where Medicaid and Nevada Check Up policies differ as documented in the Nevada Check Up Manual Chapter 1000 . MTL 20/08 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1201 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: AUTHORITY August 12, 2008 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1201 Page 1 1201 AUTHORITY 1. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 42, Public Health, Chapter IV Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Subc hapter C Medical Assistance Programs, Parts 430 through 456, states prescription drug coverage is an optional service under Title XIX. 2. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989 mandates additional preventive health care services for in fants, children and young adults (newborn through age 20) eligible for Medicaid. Th ese mandates provide that children and adolescents under age 21 receive follow-up services for a medically necessary condition discovered in a screening examination (EPDST) see Chapter 1500; this includes prescription services. 3. CFR Title 42 and Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, require states to provide for a Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program for covered outpatient drugs in order to assure that prescriptions are appropria te, medically necessary, and not likely to result in adverse medical results (SSA, Title 19, (g)(1)(A)). 4. Section 1927 of the Social Secu rity Act allows a state to require a prior authorization on any covered outpatient drug, providing th e prior authorization program complies with the requirements outlined in the act. 5. Chapter 422 of NRS amended by AB 384 to re quire the Department of Health and Human Services to; 1) develop a list of preferred prescription drugs, 2) manage prescription drug use through the use of prio r authorization and step therapy, and 3) create the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. 6. U.S. Troop Readiness, Veteran's Hea lth Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act 2007, S ection 7002(b) of the act requires Medicaid outpatient drugs (defined in Secti on 1927(k)(2) of the Social Security Act) will be reimbursable only if non-electroni c written prescriptions are executed on a tamper-resistant prescription pad. To review the PDF version of this public law refer to: http://www.asafm.army.mil/cong/cbreps/docs/2007L/supp/07EsupPL.pdf 7. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires fee-for-service State Medicaid programs to capture and report National Drug Codes (NDC) for outpatient drugs in order for the state to receive federal financial participation. 8. Section 1927 of the Social Security Act requires the establishment of a Drug Use Review (DUR) board to monitor therap eutic appropriateness, use of generic products, overutilization and underutilization of drugs and quality of care consistent with protecting the health of program beneficiaries. MTL 20/08 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1201 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: AUTHORITY August 12, 2008 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1201 Page 2 MTL 25/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1202 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: DEFINITIONS December 20, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1202 Page 1 1202 DEFINITIONS 1202.1 ACTUAL ACQUISITION COST (AAC) Actual Acquisition Cost (AAC) is the actual price paid by the pharmacy for a drug. 1202.2 ADMINISTRATION FEE The Administration fee is the dollar amount established for administering covered pharmaceuticals. 1202.3 COMPOUND DRUGS Compound means to form or make up a composite product by combining two or more different ingredients. 1202.4 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) PRICING In 2000, the US Department of Justice (DOJ ) and the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units (NAMFCU) determine that some drug manufacturers were reporting inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (AWPs) fo r some of their products. As a result, the DOJ and the NAMFCU compiled new pricing data gathered from several wholesale drug catalogs for approximately 400 national drug c odes. The State Medicaid programs had the option to implement this revised pricing from the investigation. Nevada Medicaid chose to implement the pricing algorithm at the time of its inception. The pricing is reflective of the data file from the First Data Bank. 1202.5 DISPENSING FEE Dispensing fee is the dollar amount established for dispensing covered pharmaceuticals. 1202.6 DRUG USE REVIEW (DUR) BOARD A drug use review program that consists of pr ospective drug use review, the application of explicit predetermined standards, and an educational program. The purpose of the DUR program is to improve the quality of pharmaceu tical care by ensuring that prescriptions are appropriate, medically necessary, and that they are not likely to result in adverse medical results. (CFR 456 I.B) The board consists of pharmacists and physicians. 1202.7 ESSENTIAL MEDICATIONS Essential medications are those which are medi cally necessary to counteract severe pain and/or to sustain life, limb or eyesight. Restorative, rehabilitative, preventive, and MTL 25/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1202 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: DEFINITIONS December 20, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1202 Page 2 maintenance medications must have appropria te corresponding diagnoses in the patient's chart to be considered medically necessary. 1202.8 ESTIMATED ACQUISITION COST (EAC) Estimated Acquisition Cost (EAC) is define d by Nevada Medicaid as average wholesale price less than 15 percent (AWP - 15%). EAC is based upon the original package or container size from which the prescription is dispensed. 1202.9 EXPERIMENTAL A drug prescribed for a use that is not a me dically accepted indication. The term medically accepted indication means any use of a covere d outpatient drug which is approved under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the use of which is supported by one or more citation included or approved for inclusion in any of the following compendia: American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Informa tion, United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Information, the DRUGDEX Information System or American Medical Association Drug Evaluations. 1202.10 FEDERAL UPPER LIMIT (FUL) Under the authority of 45 CFR, Part 19, the Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Board of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Serv ices has determined the maximum allowable ingredient costs. These limits apply to a ll Medicaid prescriptions unless exempted as \"Medically necessary\" by the prescriber (s ee 1203.1(B)(4) of this ch apter). The upper limit for multiple source drugs meets the criteria set forth in federal regulations. This listing is now available on the CMS homepage at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/FederalUpperLimits . 1202.11 GENERAL PUBLIC General Public is defined as the patient group accounting for the largest number of non-Medicaid prescriptions from a pharmacy. This excludes patients who purchase or receive prescriptions through third party payers such as Blue Cross, Aetna, PAID, PCS, etc. If a pharmacy discounts prices to specified custom ers, (e.g. 10% discount to senior citizens) these lower prices should be excluded from usual and customary calculations unless they represent more than 50% of the store's prescription volume. 1202.12 INPATIENTS Inpatients are those individuals receiving room , board, and medical care in a general or specialty hospital or nursing facility. Individuals living in Adult Group or Child Care Facilities are not considered inpatients. Pers ons who are bedfast and receiving home health care in a private residence are not considered inpatients.

The first segment identifies the drug manufacturer, the second segment identifies the product, and the third segment identifies the package size. MTL 25/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1202 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: DEFINITIONS December 20, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1202 Page 4 1202.20 NON-LEGEND DRUGS Non-legend pharmaceuticals are those not bearing the insignia \"Rx only\" on the label, and/or \"Caution: federal law prohibits dispen sing without a prescription.\" Non-legend pharmaceuticals may also be known as \"over-the-counter\" drugs. 1202.21 OBRA 90 DRUG REBATE Created by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliati on Act (OBRA) of 1990, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires a drug manufacturer to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secr etary of the Department of Health and Human Services for States to receive federal funding for outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid patients. The drug rebate program is administered by CMS' s Center for Medicaid and State Operations (CMSO). The law was amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 which also requires a drug manufacturer to enter into disc ount pricing agreements with the Department of Veteran's Affairs and with covered entities f unded by the Public Health Service in order to have its drugs covered by Medicaid. 1202.22 PHARMACEUTICALS Pharmaceuticals are any drug, compound, mixture, or preparations which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved for medical use. Controlled pharmaceuticals are those pharmaceuti cals listed in the schedule of substances, controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administra tion and/or the State Board of Pharmacy. 1202.23 PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS (P & T) COMMITTEE P & T Committee is established under NRS. Th e P&T Committee is comprised of physicians and pharmacist to (l) identify the prescripti on drugs that are included or excluded on the preferred drug list for Title XIX and Title XXI programs, (II) identify the therapeutic classes for review and clinical analysis, and (III) review at least annually the therapeutic classes on the preferred drug list. 1202.24 POINT OF SALE (POS) Point of Sale is a computerized claims ad judication system allowing pharmacies real-time access to recipient eligibility, drug coverage , pricing and payment information, and prospective drug utilization review across all network pharmacies. 1202.25 PREFERRED DRUG LIST (PDL) MTL 25/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1202 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: DEFINITIONS December 20, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1202 Page 5 The PDL is a listing of preferred outpatient drugs within specific therapeutic categories that have been identified, reviewed, and approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. 1202.26 PROSPECTIVE DRUG UTILIZATION REVIEW (PRO-DUR) Prospective Drug Utilization Review encompa sses the detection, evaluation, and counseling components of pre-dispensing drug therapy screening. 1202.27 SCHOOL OF MEDICINE The facility referred to in this chapter sha ll mean the University of Nevada School of Medicine, Reno and Las Vegas. 1202.28 SINGLE SOURCE DRUG Single Source Drug is defined in SS 1927(k)(7) of the Social Security Act as, \"a covered outpatient drug which is produced or distribut ed under an original new drug application approved by the Food and Drug Administrati on, including a drug product marketed by any cross-licensed producers or distributors ope rating under the new drug application\". 1202.29 STEP THERAPY The process of beginning drug therapy for a me dical condition with the safest and most effective lower risk drug therapy and progressi ng to other drug regimens only if medically necessary.

Prior authorization may be granted in life-threatening situations and for maintenance medications (see Section 1203.1A(5)(c) of this Chapter) only. 4. Early Refills Nevada Medicaid only pays for up to a 34 day supply of medications (100 day supply for maintenance medications) for recipients each month. A prescription refill will be paid for by Nevada Medicaid only when 80% of the prescription is used in accordance with the prescriber's orders on the prescription and on the label of the medication. In the instance that a recipient will be out of town when a refill is due, the pharmacist may enter the appropriate override code to allow an early refill (refer to the POS Manual for a list of acceptable overrides). This override will be monitored by Nevada Medicaid for misuse/abuse by the recipient and/or provider. Medicaid will not pay for an early prescr iption refill when gross negligence or failure to follow prescriber's prescription instructions has been displayed by the recipient. 5.

Any pharmacy, pharmacist or prescribing pr actitioner who has a current license or registration, and who is licensed by his resp ective state, and who is free from any Pharmacy Board restriction by any state, may apply to become a participating provider under this program. a. Each in-state pharmaceutical provider must have entered into a written contract, signed by the provider and/or his representative, with Nevada Medicaid to acquire participating status and must comply with federal, state and Medicaid regulations and procedures. b. The pharmaceutical provider will maintain records for all prescriptions dispensed to eligible recipients as may be required. 1. The provider will allow, upon request of proper representative, access to all records that pertain to Medi caid recipients for fiscal review, audit or utilization review. 2. All fiscal records are to be maintained for a period of six years or as specified in federal regulation. c. Application for participation may be made by phone or letter to the Nevada Medicaid Office at the location noted in the reference Section 1205.2.C. of this Chapter. Nevada Medicaid reserves the right to reject any request for participation. d. A current list of providers may be obtained through Medicaid's Fiscal Agent. 2. UTILIZATION CONTROL a. Prospective (Concurrent) Drug Utilization Review (Pro-DUR) Pro-DUR functions will be carried out vi a the Point of Sale (POS) Systems. However, verification of eligibility by provider review of the recipient's current Medicaid card at the time of service remains a necessary responsibility of the provider. 1. Pro-DUR edits apply to POS claims and paper (UCF) claims. 2. LTC claims are subject to all Pro-DUR edits that apply to retail. MTL 02/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY March 13, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 7 3. Providers may submit override c odes using the NCPDP standard interactive DUR codes. Overri de codes may be submitted on the initial claim. A denied claim does not have to be on file. 4. No long term PA's are issued, code s must be entered each time errors occur. Reference the provider manual provided by the Nevada Medicaid POS system contractor for more information on th e current Pro-DUR edits and override procedures. b. Retro Drug Utilization Review Both recipient and provider profiles (i .e. claim payments) are reviewed to identify patterns of excess. Verification of receipt of services is ongoing on a sample basis. Providers may be audited on site. c. Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Nevada Medicaid policy and federal la w allows the state appointed DUR committee to conduct review of the in formation compiled about individual clients and providers and allows the DUR committee to educate Medicaid providers about the changes in ambulat ory therapeutics. Educational programs may include information such as drug in teractions between medications that physicians have prescribed for the patients, and medications they are prescribing that are unnecessarily expensiv e. In this case, educational efforts will be directed to help providers improve their efficiency in the allocation of the finite resources available for Medicaid clients. d. Eligibility Eligibility for Medicaid services is verified by possession of a Medicaid card valid for the current month. 1. Medicaid cards printed \"A\" or \"M\" mean Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB); \"A\" is eligible for full Medicaid Services; \"M\" is eligible only for Medicare deductible and co-insurance, no other Medicaid services. A recipient card ma rked with a \"P\" is eligible only for pregnancy-related services, no others. 2.

Managed Care - HMO: All reimbur sement is subject to the enrolled health plan limitations. Contact instructions are noted on each recipient's Medicaid card. 4. Lock-in Program: When a reci pient has shown patterns of abuse/misuse of Nevada Medicaid benefits, the recipient may be \"locked-in\" to a pharmacy or provider. This means that Medicaid will only pay for controlled substance prescriptions/medical service at a single pharmacy/provider . An edit will be placed in the POS system that will not allow another pharmacy to bill for controlled substance prescriptions , and a Pro-DUR message will be given at the time of service to notify the pharmacy that the recipient is \"locked-in\". 3. GENERIC SUBSTITUTION Per NRS 639.2583, if the practitioner has not indicated that generic substitution is prohibited, the pharmacy provider must dispense, in substitution, another drug which is available to him if the other drug: a. Is less expensive than the drug prescribed by brand name; b. Is biologically equivalent to the drug prescribed by brand name; c. Has the same active ingredient or ingr edient of the same strength, quantity and form of dosage as the drug prescribed by brand name; and d. Is of the same generic type as the drug prescribed by brand name the least expensive of the drugs that are available to him for substitution. The pharmacy provider shall substitute the least expensive of the drugs available to him/her for substitution. 4. PRESCRIBER BRAND CERTIFICATION Upper Limit cost limitations specified in this Chapter will not apply when a prescriber certifies that a specific brand of medication is medically necessary for a particular patient.

DISPOSABLE MEDICAL SUPPLIES Please refer to Chapter 1300, Durable Medical Equipment (DME) for instructions on billing and any applicable limitations for these items. 4. UNIT DOSE (REPACKAGE AND RE-STOCK) REPACKAGE: Nevada Medicaid provides re imbursement incentives for Long Term Care (LTC) providers who repackage non- unit dose pharmaceuticals. An additional $0.43 per claim is given on pharmaceuticals that are repackaged for unit dose dispensing. Pharmaceuticals that First Data Bank classifies as unit dose products are not covered for this policy. This incentive is available only to pharmacies suppl ying long-term care inpatients. The pharmacy provider must apply to the QIO-like Vendor Pharmacy Department to enroll in this incentive program. In accordance with the Centers for Medicar e and Medicaid Services (CMS), State Medicaid Director Letter (SMDL) 06-005, rep ackaging of pharmaceuticals must be in compliance with the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy. In addition, nursing facilities must properly credit the Medicaid program for the return of unused prescription medicines upon discontinuance of the prescripti on or transfer, discharge or death of a Medicaid beneficiary. This is to assure there is no double billing of the medication. 5. THIRD PARTY LIABILITY Medicaid is always payer of last resort when ever any other resource is responsible for payment. \"Third Party\" means any individual entity on program that is, or may be, liable to pay all or part of the expenditu res for medical assistance furnished under a state Medicaid plan. Other medical re sources include, but are not limited to, Medicare, private insurance, self-insured plans, and workers compensation insurance. The exceptions to this rule are Indian H ealth Services, and Children with Special Health Care Needs (previously known as Cr ippled Children's Services), and state victims of crime. Medicaid is a prior resource to these programs. Billing all other third party resources is mandated by federal and state law, and is one of the provisions of the Provider Agr eement signed by participating Medicaid providers. In addition, a Medicaid provider cannot refuse to furnish Medicaid covered services to a Medicaid eligible individual due to potential Third Party Liability (TPL) for the services. However, if the provider does not participate in the recipient's Other Health Care (OHC) plan, the provider shoul d refer the recipient to the OHC plan. Nevada Medicaid may deny payment for the OHC plan covered services if the recipient elects to seek treatment from a provider not authorized by the OHC plan. If MTL 02/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY March 13, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 12 the Medicaid recipient voluntarily elects to receive Medicaid covered services from a provider who does not participate in the r ecipient's OHC plan, the recipient assumes the responsibility to pay for the services the same as a private pay only patient. a. Coordination of Benefits (COB) On-line COB (cost avoidance) is part of the Nevada Medicaid POS system. 1. If Nevada Medicaid is the recipi ent's secondary carrier, claims for COB will be accepted. 2. Nevada Medicaid is always the payer of last resort. 3. Other coverage will be identified by the presence of other carrier information on the recipient eligibility file. 4. If the recipient shows other coverage, the claim will be denied. The POS system will return a unique client-identified carrier code identifying the other carrier, the recipient's policy number and the carrier name in the additional messa ge filed. It is possible that a recipient may have more than one ac tive other carrier; in that case, the returned code will be from the first carrier, subsequent codes will be returned until fully exhausted. Providers will be required to submit this code OTHER PAYER ID (#340-7C) fi eld as part of the override process. 5. Even if \"no other insurance\" is indicated on the eligibility file, the claim will be processed as a TPL claim if the pharmacy submits. 6. If other insurance is indicated on the eligibility file, the claim will be processed as a TPL regardless of what TPL codes the pharmacy submits. 7. In all cases, the Nevada Medicaid \"allowed amount\" will be used when calculating payment. In some cases, this may result in a \"0\" payment, when the insurance carrier pays more than the Medicaid \"allowable amount\". 8. In order to facilitate the TPL/ COB process, Nevada Medicaid will allow providers to override \"days supply limits\" and/or \"Drug Requires PA\" conditions by entering a value of \"5\" (exemption from prescription limits) in the PA/MC CODE field (NCPCP #416DG) if there are no PA requirements on these drugs from the primary insurer. b. Non-participating HMO Providers 1. Recipients, who have Medicaid and HMO coverage, including Medicare HMOs, must seek treatment and services through their preferred provider network or HMO. Nevada Medicaid is not liable to pay for HMO covered services if the recipient elects to seek treatment from a provider not authorized by th e HMO. Unless the provider is an authorized provider of a recipient's health plan, the recipient should be MTL 02/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY March 13, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 13 referred to the plan for covered treatment, or the provider should contact the HMO for treatment authorization. 2. Exceptions to Medicaid liability policy are: a. The service(s) is/are a non-covered benefit of the HMO plan; b. The service is an emergency and a participating provider is more than 25 miles away; c. The service is for family planning; d. The recipient resides outside the service area of the HMO; or e. The recipient's HMO coverage has been exhausted. 6. PHARMACY BILLING PROCESS a. National Council for Prescription Drug Program (NCPDP) Standard Billing Units Nevada Medicaid reimburses for outpatient pharmaceuticals according to NCPDP \"Billing Unit Standard Format\" guidelines. The standard provides for the billing of pharmaceuticals in one of three billing units for all drug products. These units are \"each\", \"m illiliter (ml)\", and \"gram (g)\". The following guidelines are to be used when billing Nevada Medicaid for pharmaceuticals: Tablets, Capsules, Suppositories, Pre-filled Syringes : must be billed by \"each\". For example, if 30 tablets of Metformin are dispensed, the quantity will be 30. Liquids, Liquid Orals, Suspensions, So lutions, Opthalmic/Otic Solutions: must be billed by milliliters (mls). For example, if 560ml of guiafenesin is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 560. PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to ml (1 ounce = 30ml). Liters must be converted to ml (1L = 1000ml). Ointments, Bulk Powders: must be b illed by grams. For example, if a two ounce tube of oxiconazole nitrate is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 60. PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to grams (1 ounce = 30g, \u00bd ounce = 15g). Oral Contraceptives/Therapy packs: must be billed per \"each\" tablet dispensed, not the number of packages. For example, Ortho Tri-Cyclen is a 28-day dial pack, the quantity entered will be 28. MTL 02/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY March 13, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 14 Transdermal Patches/Powder Packets: must be billed per \"each\" patch/packet dispensed, regardless of whether they ar e pre-packaged in a box or come in individual pouches/packets. For exampl e, Catapress-TTS comes in a box of four patches. If two of these boxes ar e dispensed, the quantity entered will be eight. Inhalers and Aerosols: must be billed as either grams or ml, as specified by the manufacturer on the labeling. For example a 90mcg(microgram)/inh Albuterol Inhaler has a total of 17gm in the canister. If one of these is dispensed, 17 will be quantity entered. Topical Products: must be billed as either grams or ml, as specified by the manufacturer on the labeling. PLEASE NOTE: Ounces must be converted to grams or ml. 1 ounce = 30ml 1 ounce = 30g Reconstitutables (oral, otic, ophthalmic): must be billed per ml that are/will be in the bottle after reconstituti on according to the manufacturer's instructions. Liquid Injectables (vials, ampoules): must be billed by milliliters (ml). For example, if a 10ml vial of Novolin 70/30 is dispensed, the quantity entered will be 10. Powdered Injectables (vials): must be billed by \"each\" vial given per dose. For example if the recipient receives Ampicillin 1g every 6 hours for 1 week, the quantity entered will be 1, as only one vial is used per dose (assuming a 1gm vial is used), and the # of doses entered will be 28 (4 per day x 7 days). PLEASE NOTE: If the product is supplied with a diluent, the quantity entered is only the number of powdered vials dispensed, the diluent is not factored in. Intravenous Solutions: must be billed in ml administered per dose. For example, if a recipient receives 250ml of Normal Saline four times per day, the quantity entered will be 250, as that is the quantity per dose. Blood Derived Products: products may vary in potency from batch to batch. Anithemophilic products must be billed as the number of antihemophilic units dispensed (each). Prolastin must si milarly be billed as the number of milligrams dispensed (each). MTL 02/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY March 13, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 15 Kits: defined as products with a least two different or discreet items (excluding diluents, applicators and activ ation devices) in the same package, intended for dispensing as a unit. K its carry only a single NDC. Kits are intended to be dispensed as a unit and should be billed as a unit of each kit dispensed (each). For further information, refer to th e NCPDP Billing Unit Standard Format Official Release. b. Provider Numbers The state NABP provider number is to be used and entered when billing online using the POS system or when using the UCF. 7. STATE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE COST (SMAC) a. State Maximum Allowable Cost (SMA C) is the upper reimbursement limit for multi-source outpatient pharmaceuticals esta blished by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP), or Fiscal Agent. 1. DHCFP Fiscal Agent will perform ongoi ng market analysis to monitor pricing patterns and product availability. 2. DHCFP Fiscal Agent will perfor m monthly updates of the drugs subject to the SMAC. 3. All drugs subject to the SMAC and updates will be posted on the following website: http://nevada.fhsc.com b. Providers may appeal the current SMAC for a pharmaceutical product if a provider determines that a particular multi-source drug is not available at the current SMAC reimbursement. 1. The pharmacy must contact the Fis cal Agent technical call center to initiate the appeal. 2. Information needed to make a decision will include NDC number, manufacturer, drug name, strength, a nd price paid. A faxed copy of the actual invoice for the drug may be requested. 3. Inquiries not resolved by the technical call center are forwarded to the Fiscal Agent's SMAC Coordinator for investigation and resolution. 4. If it is determined the SMAC is ne gatively impacting access to care for recipients, the SMAC Coordinator has the authority to 1) adjust SMAC pricing for the particular cl aim being appealed, and 2) make changes to the SMAC pricing file. MTL 02/07 DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCING AND POLICY Section: 1203 MEDICAID SERVICES MANUAL Subject: POLICY March 13, 2007 PRESCRIBED DRUGS Section 1203 Page 16 5. Appeals will be responded to within three working days of the referral to the SMAC Coordinator. 1203.1E AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES PRIOR AUTHORIZATION (PA) REQUESTS: P hysician's may request payment for exceptions to program limitations outlined in Section 1203.1A(1) of this Chapter and medications requiring prior authorization in A ppendix A of this Chapter by forwarding a PA request to the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO-like vendor). The phone/fax number is located in Section 1205 of this Chapter. 1. When completing the PA providers must: a. Provide all relevant diagnoses. b. List all routine essential drugs being prescribed. c. The requesting physician must sign the PA and forward all copies to the QIO- like vendor. He/she will be advised by return copy of the decision. (A facsimile signature stamp is acceptable.) d.

Note that the POS system does not require a \"PA Number\" to be entered on a paper or electronic claim; the only requirement is that the PA record is activated in the system prio r to the claim submission. The approved PA will be in the POS sy stem and will be active for all pharmacies using the POS system, unless the recipient is \"locked-in\" to a particular pharmacy for abuse/misuse reasons. c. A prior authorization will typically be required to be requested and entered prior to the dispensing of the medicati on, however there may be situations in which an authorization request is considered after the fact (e.g. retroactive eligibility). d. For clinical prior authorizations in which a Clinical Call Centre PA Unit pharmacist or pharmacy technician reque sts information from the prescribing physician, the PA will deny if the doctor does not respond to a request for information within three working days. e. The Nevada Medicaid QIO-like vendor will send all denial of service letters.
