Photo: Neles Business reviews 14 Strong year for Valmet with a major strategic step forward During the year, Valmet was able to grow all its businesses. 2valmet | annual review 2021 | president and ceo's reviewValmet continued its strong performance and consistent develop - ment of its operations in 2021. During the year, Valmet was able to grow all its businesses. The very active market demand for our board and paper making technologies continued. We also made several important pulp technology delivery agreements, for exam - ple, in Finland, Brazil and China. The market for our services and automation solutions recovered compared to last year and both businesses returned on growth track. In 2021, Valmet's orders received increased by 30 percent to EUR 4,740 million, and our order backlog at the end of the year was EUR 4,096 million. Net sales increased by 5 percent and amounted to EUR 3,935 million. The comparable EBITA margin was at an all-time high 10.9 percent. Solid current market and new opportunities in emerging sectors E-commerce, emerging markets growth, rising living standards and the shift to renewable materials are supporting the demand of Valmet's process technologies, automation and services for pulp, paper and energy sectors. Valmet has an excellent position in the growing market for the conversion of renewable raw materials into sustainable end products, and we are continuously develop - ing and introducing innovations for our customers. For example, in addition to our traditional markets, there are new emerging opportunities in cellulose-based and recycled textile production, in which Valmet's current pulp and board making technologies can be adapted. As the first important steps in this sector, Valmet made an agreement to supply drying technology to a planned renewable textile fibre factory in Finland, and to supply the main equipment for a planned textile recycling plant in Swe - den in 2021. We can also provide textile fiber producers with the full scope of automation solutions and services. Merging Neles to Valmet a major strategic step In July 2021, Valmet and Neles announced that the companies had signed a combination agreement and a merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger. The pending combination will be implemented as a statutory absorption merger, whereby Neles will be merged to Valmet. Following the combination, Valmet is expected to become a stronger globally leading company with a unique offering to process industries around the world, consisting of process technologies, services and automation, including auto - mation systems and flow control solutions. The merger is intended to create a platform for further growth of the automation business. The completion of the merger is pending the needed regulatory approvals and is targeted to take place on April 1, 2022.During the year, we also continued to strengthen Valmet with smaller business acquisitions. In 2021, we especially developed our environmental systems offering with two purchases. Ambitious climate program introduced, with concrete targets and action plans In March 2021, Valmet introduced a climate program with con - crete targets for our entire value chain, including the supply chain, our own operations and the customer use of our technologies. I have been delighted to see strong commitment to and enthusiasm for this program among Valmet employees, and that we have been able to create concrete roadmaps for achieving the set targets by 2030. Many of Valmet's customers have set CO2 reduction targets for their own operations, and thus the interest, support and expec - tations towards our program and our ability to support our cus - tomers in their own efforts through this program have been high. In 2021, Valmet continued to receive recognition for the progress of its sustainability work in various sustainability ratings and was included for the eighth consecutive year in the Dow Jones World and Europe Sustainability Indices. Moving forward together with the committed Valmet team The uncertainty in the markets will continue in 2022. The Valmet team has continued to show exceptional resilience and commit - ment to serve our customers and ensure successful project deliv - eries in all circumstances. We will continue on this path, priori - tizing the safety of our employees and customers, while ensuring the best possible customer experience, both on site and remotely. I warmly thank all Valmet employees around the world for their excellent work and our partners for their good cooperation during the year. I wish to express my appreciation to all our customers for the trust you have shown in Valmet.

The transaction between Valmet and Solidium took place on July 1, 2020. The agreed purchase price corresponded to a total transaction value of EUR 179 million at the signing. In the fall of 2020, Valmet gradually increased its ownership in Neles to 29.5 percent. In September, it approached the Board of Directors of Neles with a proposal to start discussions on a potential statutory merger between the two companies. However, these discussions did not proceed further then, but they were revisited in 2021, leading to the combination agreement and a merger plan in July 2021. Globally balanced expert organization with approximately 17,000 professionals In July 2021, Valmet and Neles announced that their respective Boards of Directors had signed a combination agreement and a merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger. The pending combination will be implemented as a statutory absorption merger, whereby Neles will be merged into Valmet. The Extraordinary General Meetings of both companies resolved to approve the merger in September 2021. The completion of the merger is targeted to take place on 1 April, 2022. The planned closing date may be delayed due to the regulatory processes ongoing. Together, Valmet and Neles expect to create a leading company with a unique offering for process industries globally, with illustrative combined net sales for 2020 of approximately EUR 4.3 billion. In addition, the combined company will have a globally balanced expert organization of approximately 17,000 professionals. On completion, it is estimated that former Neles' shareholders will own approximately 18.8 percent of the shares and votes of the combined company, and former Valmet shareholders will own approximately 81.2 percent of the shares and votes. The name of the combined company will remain Valmet Oyj, and Pasi Laine will continue as the President and CEO after the completion of the merger. It is planned that Neles will be organized as an independent entity called Flow Control business line. The Board of Directors of Valmet has together with its management considered appropriate preliminary financial targets for the combined company and agreed on the following framework: net sales for services and automation business to grow over two times the market growth, net sales for capital business to exceed market growth, comparable EBITA margin to be 12-14 percent, comparable return on capital employed (ROCE) before taxes to be at least 15 percent, and dividend payout to be at least 50 percent of net profit. A solid platform for further growth in automation The combination of the companies is expected to create a solid platform for further growth in the automation sphere consisting of automation systems, automation products and flow control solutions. The combined company is expected to have a significant position in process-critical valves and valve automation products, pulp and paper automation systems, analyzers and measurements, and new applications, including hydrogen and biomass technologies. It will also have growth potential in these sectors and through the increased penetration into the energy and process industry end markets. The resulting revenue, technology development and cost synergy potential of the merger is expected to contribute to shareholder value creation. The combination is expected to generate annual run-rate synergies of approximately EUR 25 million, of which approximately 60 percent are expected to be achieved by 2023, and approximately 90 percent by 2024. Total one-off implementation costs related to synergies are expected to be approximately EUR 25 million. Additionally, the combined company is expected to benefit from Valmet's excellent track record and capability in developing integrated businesses. This is well evidenced in Valmet's successful growth of its Automation business and multiple acquisitions over the past few years. read more: valmet.com/merger 45valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | valmet and neles to mergeResearch and development Innovation, cooperation and technology leadership for a carbon neutral future. 46valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | research and developmentValmet aims to be a technology and innovation leader, and we have clear focus areas in research and development (R&D). Our R&D also plays a key role in Valmet's climate program, which was introduced in 2021. Valmet's offering enhances the efficient usage of raw materials, water and energy. It also promotes the use of renewable materials and reduces emissions. Our R&D work is carried out mainly in Finland and Sweden by the R&D organizations in our business lines. Our operations also include 16 pilot facilities for customer projects and internal R&D. At the end of 2021, R&D employed a total of 471 people, while R&D expenses for the year amounted to EUR 82 million. We continuously develop new solutions to improve customers' performance. We launch around 100 new products every year. The products are often created in close cooperation with customers or our network of leading universities and research institutes around the world. Increased focus on a carbon neutral future 2021 saw several major developments come to fruition, such as our cooperation with Renewcell, a pioneer in alternative renew - able textile materials. Their new plant in Sundsvall, Sweden, is the first commercial-scale textile recycling plant in the world. The plant will produce Circulose\u00ae, a recyclable raw material made from discarded textiles, using their patented process and tailored equipment from Valmet. Replacing resource-intensive virgin fiber and fossil-based materi - als like polyester is an excellent example of how Valmet can con - tribute to sustainable new circular economies. Valmet's solution itself was a prime example of how to make the best of what you already have. Efficiency through digitalization One of the key benefits of digitalization is that it utilizes real-time data and big data analysis to reduce the environmental impacts of our customers' mills and plants. By increasing process reliability and decreasing unplanned maintenance, customers' production is maximised, and their entire equipment range is managed with greater efficiency. In 2021, Valmet and ARAUCO, a forestry company, signed an agreement to jointly develop the Arauco Mill Line 3 in Chile to become the world's most autonomous pulp mill. The target is to run the entire mill at higher efficiency using Valmet's Industrial Internet (VII) solutions. Our VII solutions combine advanced monitoring and prediction applications, process controls and simulators, along with remote services from Valmet Performance Centers. New renewable materials Enabling our customers to convert renewable and recyclable mate - rials into sustainable products and commercial results is the core of Valmet's mission. In 2021, we supplied drying machines for the Spinnova-Suzano joint venture in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland. The drying technology, originally for paper and board making, was further developed by Valmet and adapted for cellulose-based textile fiber production in the future factory. The customer's new textile factory will produce SPINNOVA\u00ae fiber, a sustainable natural textile fiber produced from wood or cellulosic biomass waste, using a patented process that produces no waste or sidestreams. Valmet technologies and expertise help customers like Spinnova-Suzano with breakthrough technology in renewable resources to scale up production to meet commercial demands. Virtual reality for a better reality In 2021, Valmet also delivered the world's first fully virtual paper mill to Mondi's new production line in Ruomberok, Slovakia. The virtual mill is a complete digital twin of the mill machinery and surrounding facilities. Operators enter a 360\u00b0 virtual learning environment where they can move around and interact with simulated machinery. This learning method helps mill employees internalize lessons through personal experience, significantly improving knowledge retention, mill per - formance and workplace safety.

Procure - ment targets a significant improvement in Valmet's profitability, competitiveness, supply chain sustainability and overall delivery efficiency. Valmet has 20,000 active direct suppliers in more than 50 coun - tries, and we spend 2.5 billion euros in direct and indirect pur - chases annually. More than half of our purchases come from Fin - land and Sweden, but the share of sourcing from local suppliers in other countries is increasing. Traction through decentralization Central procurement is part of Valmet's Operational Develop - ment team. Direct and indirect procurement operates a network of teams distributed throughout our business lines and areas. Altogether, we have some 500 procurement professionals located in five continents in more than 20 countries. Valmet has procurement teams in several cost-competitive coun - tries identifying and developing cost-effective, innovative suppli - ers for Valmet. Savings can be significant when purchasing from a supplier in a cost-competitive country. This strategy also aug - ments our ongoing efforts to innovate and continuously improve with our well-established sustainable, high-quality suppliers. In addition to building a strong supplier base, Procurement con - tinues to advance toward digitalization. With the right systems and tools, we are able to monitor real-time performance and gain new insights into improvement opportunities.Positive performance in a challenging environment Many of our procurement performance indicators developed favorably during 2021. Our primary target, procurement sav - ings, saw notable improvement. We consider this our top key performance indicator, because it has a high impact on Valmet's profitability. Another indicator we saw improve this year is cost-competitive country sourcing. By expanding procurement options to a wider range of countries, we have been able to reduce costs while adding additional flexibility to our supplier network. Though our overall performance was quite strong, during 2021, we saw a decline in on-time deliveries. However, this is not unique to Valmet. Most international companies have suffered from de - lays and shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Targeted mitigation efforts to offset risks While our annual increase in purchases reflects Valmet's positive growth, 2021 also saw remarkable inflation, particularly in steel and logistics prices, spurred on by a world economy rebounding in an ongoing pandemic. The widely reported shortage of semi - conductors also impacted Valmet. Increased regular follow-up of suppliers, open dialogue and target - ed negotiations are some of the ways we have dealt with the supply challenges. When possible, purchases have been moved outside the timeframe of predicted price peaks. Where bottlenecks and shortages prevail, as with semiconductors, our purchasing team is locating and onboarding new sources. Mitigation efforts are not limited to the buyer side. Some suppliers increased their capacities during 2021 faster than anything we have seen in more than a decade. Our long-term suppliers have also been able to prioritize their deliveries to Valmet. In addition, Valmet warehouses expanded buffers to accommodate potential supply uncertainty. Local buying also took on new urgency to alleviate the bottlenecks in container logistics. By increasing our purchases from carefully selected suppliers in cost-competitive countries, we have been able to counter some of the price increases. Despite the actions taken by Valmet and its suppliers, on-time delivery performance and overall supply logistics remain very challenging. We will continue to work closely with suppliers to overcome these challenges and establish positive trends.

Our Quality organization aims to maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty through continuous improvement across the value chain. To achieve the high-quality performance outlined in our Quality Policy, we have created and continuously develop our manage - ment system to ensure that the whole value chain works in unison for our customers' success. This requires a deep understanding of customer needs and expectations, along with high-quality deliv - eries that cement positive long-term customer relationships. Unified quality governance Valmet's quality governance is carried out at three organizational levels: corporate; business line and area; and most importantly, the local business level. Steered by the Quality Core Team with representatives from all business lines and areas, our governance model ensures the quality performance of all our operations in all locations is continuously improving and meets set targets. To ensure high quality before, during and after deliveries, we follow documented processes for supplier evaluation, quality as - surance and inspections. Valmet supervisors also regularly verify that we conform to customer requirements and support customer satisfaction. Consolidated certifications and Global Management System (GMS) One of our more significant quality achievements in recent years was consolidating ISO certifications. The number of indi - vidual certificates decreased from 154 to just three. Since De - cember 2018, Valmet has one global certificate for Quality (ISO 9001:2015), Environment (ISO 14001:2015) and Health & Safety (ISO 45001:2018).We have brought our quality efforts under a single global man - agement. The management system is audited both internally and by authorized external third parties. The audits' results are used as an input for corrective actions and continuous improvement. Quality strategy with tangible results Excellence in processes is a Must-Win at Valmet. This includes the promise to constantly improve quality as well as health, safety and environment performance. We achieve this by documenting and communicating quality processes, monitoring these process - es with performance indicators and committing to continuous improvement. A primary performance indicator is Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ), measured as a percentage of net sales. It captures all those costs which materialize from not meeting customer ex - pectations the first time. We recently rolled out an improved new definition and process for tracking COPQ. This key performance indicator not only helps us determine the impact of quality on our business but makes the whole concept of quality more concrete for employees and helps prioritize corrective actions. Throughout 2021, we also increased our focus on the Continuous Improvement (CI) of our operations by developing quality risk management and problem-solving systems, tools and capabili - ties. We determine CI performance by monitoring the resolution of quality issues and implementation of identified improvement opportunities. Building a culture of quality Our strong culture of quality is centered on communication. From documenting processes to training programs, sharing success stories and real-time data, we make sure everyone has the knowledge and resources they need to manage and improve quality. Employees are encouraged to share what quality means for them, and how they make it happen in their daily work as we work together to meet the needs of our customers. Though tools and processes are necessary for success, quality is ultimately a people issue. At Valmet, we fundamentally improve quality by learning and being proactive. Our goal is for all Valmet employees to take personal responsibility for the quality of their work and for continuous improvement. Through structured, consistent development actions and effective quality tools and processes, we create the building blocks for personal success.Quality highlights in 2021 Global quality governance model Systematic quality communication Harmonized quality systems and tools New definition and process for Cost of Poor Quality Focus on quality risk management and problem solving 51valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | quality52valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainabilitySustainability 53valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainabilitySustainability is at the core of Valmet's business strategy and operations Our values, Code of Conduct and related policies, and selected globally acknowledged initiatives and principles create the foun - dation for sustainable performance at Valmet. The role of our sustainability work is to support growth, reduce risks and enable cost savings. Sustainability is also an integral part of our strategy process and related Must-Wins. It is integrated in our processes through the comprehensive Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda, which covers the five most material sustainability focus areas in our value chain: a sustainable supply chain; health, safety and environment; people and performance; sustainable solutions; and corporate citizenship. The sustainability agenda is aligned with the Paris Climate Agree - ment's 1.5-degree pathway and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and it is executed through concrete three- year action plans. In 2021, we continued to systematically implement the actions defined in the current action plan for 2019-2021. During the year, we also renewed the Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda. The renewal in - cluded an analysis of the business environment, benchmarks and peer reviews, industry and corporate sustainability trends, future regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. Based on this, we have identified new focus areas and updated the material topics for Valmet's value chain. The new agenda was approved by Valmet's Executive team, and we will introduce the renewed agenda with detailed action plans in 2022. Our continuous progress to integrate sustainability into our busi - ness processes, policies and tools has positioned us as the industry leader in sustainability. In 2021, Valmet was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the eight consecutive year and was ranked in the top 1 percent in the Ecovadis sustainabil - ity assessment. Valmet also received a B rating in CDP's climate program ranking. 1.4 LOST TIME INCIDENT FREQUENCY FOR EMPLOYEES 14% CO2 EMISSIONS* REDUCTION FROM 2019 BASELINE * Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions from own operations. 54valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainabilityGoal 6: Clean water and sanitation Efficient water management plays a key role in Valmet's technologies, e.g. evaporation and condensate treatment solutions, ultrafiltration solutions and tissue, and board and paper machines can help customers to recycle process water and reduce freshwater use and water pollution. Improving water efficiency and decreasing water consumption are also part of Valmet's environ mental targets for its own operations by 2030. Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy Valmet's energy solutions are based on biomass, waste or a mixture of different fuels. Valmet impacts this goal through energy technologies e.g. by enabling heat and power production in biomass, waste and multifuel boilers, increasing the use of different fuel mixes, and air emission control systems for pulp mill and power plant flue gases. Valmet is also contributing to this goal by replacing fossil fuels with renewables, purchasing CO2-free electricity, and improving energy efficiency in its own operations.Most impactful and relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals for ValmetSUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN We develop our existing processes that create the foundation for a sustainable supply chain We create new approaches to reduce the environmental impacts of our supply chainSUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS We create technologies and services that enhance renewable raw materials, and water and energy efficiency We actively promote the sustainability benefits of Valmet's offering to meet customer needsCORPORATE CITIZENSHIP We ensure our global human rights compliance through a due diligence framework We are a trusted local partner and promote transparent reporting PEOPLE AND PERFORMANCE We boost employee engagement and develop the best talent We are a responsible employer and promote diversityHEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT (HSE) We invest in a safety culture and effective HSE processes and practices We collaborate with customers and partners to improve HSE results360\u00ba Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth Valmet's goal is zero harm to people and the environment. Valmet aims for a positive, safe, and fair working environment, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. We have a human rights management process for our own operations and supply chain, e.g. to ensure human rights and protect labor rights. Valmet contributes to global economic productivity through investments in R&D, manufacturing high value-adding and resource- efficient technology and fostering innovation. Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production Valmet develops process technologies, automation, and services to enable replacement of fossil materials with renewables and to support customers in producing high-value end products. We also aim to improve resource efficiency throughout the value chain to ensure responsible consumption and production processes. Valmet's technologies are designed for maximum resource and raw material efficiency, enabling the circular economy. Lightweight technologies that reduce fiber in board production, hybrid technologies that save fiber in tissue production, high-yield chemical pulp cooking, and fiberlines and power boilers that use residues impact this goal by significantly increasing the efficient use of resources. Valmet has a waste management target for its own operations by 2030. Valmet's sustainable supply chain management also contributes to this goal. Goal 13: Climate action Valmet has validated science-based CO2 emission reduction targets and concrete actions for the whole value chain. Valmet contributes to this goal by offering bioenergy self-sufficient chemical pulp mills and enabling carbon neutral biomass-based heat and power production. By 2030, our target is to enable 100 percent carbon neutral production for customers. In addition, our target is to reduce CO2 emissions by 80 percent in our own operations and 20 percent in our supply chain by 2030. Valmet has also analyzed the potential long-term climate-related physical and transitional risks and their financial impact on its operations and business environment with different climate scenarios to support strategy and the capability to adapt to and mitigate climate change. 55valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainability360\u00b0SUPPLY CHAIN Our supply chain accounts for approximately 4 percent of the carbon footprint of our entire value chain. Our target is to reduce CO emissions in our supply chain by 20 percent by 2030\u00b9. We will achieve this with a wide range of actions such as increasing the share of recycled steel in our products, supporting CO-intensive suppliers in reducing their emis - sions, decreasing the weight of our products and introducing alternative materials, and supporting suppliers in optimizing their manufacturing methods. We will also centralize spend to suppliers offering low carbon transportation and continue to develop freight planning. During 2021, Valmet identified its most CO-intensive direct purchasing categories and the most CO-intensive suppliers within the categories. As part of this, we developed data qual - ity and coverage by increasing the share of supplier-specific reporting. In the coming years, we will focus on supporting our high emitting suppliers to reduce emissions through training and engagement. We will also increase lower emission trans - portation modes. Forward to a carbon neutral future Valmet believes that technology plays a key role in mitigating climate change and global warming in the transition to a carbon neutral economy. In 2021, we introduced our ambitious climate program Forward to a carbon neutral future which continues our comprehensive sustainability work. Valmet's climate program includes ambitious CO emission re - duction targets and concrete actions across the whole value chain, including the supply chain, our own operations, and customers' use of technologies. We have made an extensive analysis to mea - sure the main CO impacts from our value chain and defined the actions to reduce emissions, for example, through fossil re - placement in energy and electricity. The targets will be achieved without emission compensation, and the program is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement's 1.5-degree pathway and with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. During the year, the program has progressed well and has received positive feedback internally and externally. The program targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which means that the targets are based on the latest climate sci - ence. Valmet also signed a EUR 300 million syndicated revolving credit facility with a margin linked to its climate targets.Valmet's climate program includes ambitious CO2 emission reduction targets and concrete actions across the value chain. 56valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | climate programOWN OPERATIONS Less than one percent of our value chain's carbon footprint arises from our own operations. Our target is to reduce CO emissions by 80 percent in our own operations by 2030\u00b9. We are driving this transformation by replacing fossil fuels with renewables in our locations, purchasing CO-free electricity and district heat, and implementing energy efficiency improve - ments. We will enhance the use of digital tools and further develop remote working habits that reduce business travel emissions. We will also promote low-carbon commuting. In 2021, our locations renewed lighting, distribution rooms, heat recovery, air ventilation and other operations to be more energy efficient. In Sweden, we executed energy management audits for all locations to identify future efficiency actions. Sev - eral studies are ongoing for the installation of solar energy in our facilities. We have also explored the options for purchasing carbon neutral district heating in the rest of our main locations in Finland and Sweden, similar to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 in Finland, which have been purchasing carbon neutral district heating since 2016. At the end of the year, 20 percent of Valmet's global electricity consumption was CO neutral. USE PHASE OF VALMET'S TECHNOLOGIES Most of Valmet's value chain's carbon footprint comes from the use phase of its technologies. Today, our customers' chemical pulp mills provided by Valmet are usually bioenergy self-sufficient already. Furthermore, we enable carbon neutral heat and power production for our customers with our current biomass-based en - ergy solutions. By 2030\u00b9, Valmet's target is to enable 100 percent carbon neutral production for all its pulp and paper customers by developing new process technologies\u00b2. We are also improving the energy efficiency of our current offering by 20 percent. Energy efficiency and carbon neutrality-related projects play a key role in our research and development. Our new technologies, products and services contribute to a sustainable carbon-free fu - ture. In 2021, we marketed our offering for the reduction of CO emissions for our customers.

59valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | progress on sustainability360\u00b0 agendaValmet has fully integrated sustainability into its supply chain processes, and our target is to continuously enhance our supply chain management and the transparency of our value chain. We want to ensure that we operate responsibly throughout the val - ue chain, and that the materials and components we purchase are in compliance with Valmet's sustainability requirements for our suppliers and with relevant local and global regulations and standards. We continuously engage our suppliers in developing their own sustainability performance and provide concrete, hands-on sup - port to do so. Valmet has established processes to evaluate, man - age and support its suppliers' more sustainable operations in a globally aligned manner through auditing processes and supplier sustainability engagement programs. Global and extensive supplier network Valmet has an extensive supplier network, including 20,000 active direct suppliers in more than 50 countries with different sustainability maturity and risk levels. However, more than half our purchases originate from Finland and Sweden when measured by supplier spend. Most of Valmet's direct purchases come from low-risk countries in terms of sustainability. Our main purchases consist of metals-based products and components, electronics, and different services. Several potential sustainability risks may occur in our complex supply chains, and we therefore work systematically to ensure re - sponsible business practices in all our partnerships. Our ambition is to support our suppliers' more sustainable operations and to further strengthen our cooperation with them. Supplier sustainability management process Valmet has a global four-step supplier sustainability management process. All suppliers are required to sign Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy, which addresses Valmet's minimum require - ments for its suppliers regarding business ethics and compliance, human rights and labor rights, occupational health and safety, en - vironmental management, and sustainable products and services. Sustainable supply chain In 2021, we continued the execution and development of our existing key processes to enhance sustainability in our supply chain. We conducted supplier sustainability audits on site and remotely and proceeded with the implementation of our supplier sustainability engagement program. SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN POLICY All suppliers are required to sign Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain PolicySUSTAINABILITY RISK ASSESSMENT All suppliers are evaluated through a five-level sustainability risk assessmentSUPPLIER SELF- ASSESSMENTS A poor result in the risk assessment leads to a supplier sustainability self-assessmentSUSTAINABILITY AUDITS A poor result in the self-assessment leads to an auditVALMET'S GLOBAL SUPPLIER SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT PROCESS Required from all suppliers Required based on a supplier risk assessment 60valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainable supply chainEUR MILLION 2021 Finland 1,182 China 309 Sweden 290 USA 168 Germany 71 Poland 61 Canada 48 Brazil 45 India 39 Italy 39PURCHASES (10 LARGEST COUNTRIES) 100% OF SELECTED KEY SUPPLIERS ENGAGED GLOBALLY 41 SUPPLIER SUSTAINABILITY AUDITS CONDUCTED IN 14 COUNTRIES 61valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainable supply chainWe expect all our suppliers to comply with the principles defined in the policy; it is the starting point for all business relationships with Valmet. The policy and risk assessment acts as a basis for self-assessments and sustainability audits. All suppliers are evaluated through a sustainability risk assess - ment based on the country of purchase and the purchasing cate - gory. The aim is to assess the potential negative impacts and risks related to ethical business practices, environmental performance, health and safety, human rights, and labor practices. If the suppli - er's risk level is increased, a sustainability self-assessment is also required from the supplier. A low score in the self-assessment will lead to a sustainability audit. Other criteria for audits include a high sustainability risk or a high annual spend. Ensuring the right timing and good quality of the audit follow-up The last part of Valmet's global supplier sustainability manage - ment process is to ensure that our suppliers operate in compliance with the requirements of our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy and with local and international law. We have conducted sustainabil - ity audits globally every year since 2015. In 2021, we conducted 41 supplier sustainability audits in 14 coun - tries with a certified third-party auditor. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also developed a remote audit framework and arranged three remote supplier sustainability audits. During the year, we continued to focus on ensuring the right timing and good quality of the audit follow-up process and the verification of agreed corrective actions. The findings of these audits were mainly related to health and safety, and environmental management. Of all corrective actions agreed with suppliers in 2021, 26 percent had been completed and verified by the end of the year. 86 percent of all actions agreed with suppliers as part of the auditing process since 2015 had been completed and verified by the end of 2021. Supplier sustainability engagement program increases efforts for common sustainability goals Valmet has around 100 key suppliers, of which ca. 30 percent are identified as possible sources of potential sustainability risks for Valmet based on the country of origin and the purchasing cate- gory. To further strengthen the cooperation with these important suppliers, Valmet has created a sustainability engagement pro - gram. The program supports and monitors these suppliers' per - formance and provides hands-on concrete tools and training for them to take the most critical steps to develop their sustainability practices. The program is based on the principles of Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy, and it is an integral part of our supplier relationship management (SRM) program. The program was piloted in China in 2018, and it has since been launched in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. In 2021, the program was launched in North and South America. The launch included inter - nal training and conducting a virtual key supplier sustainability day for the participating suppliers, introducing the importance of and approach to sustainability at Valmet and insights and best practices to develop more sustainable business operations. There was a focus on Valmet's new climate program and the growing expectations for companies to transform their operations to re - duce emissions and eliminate fossil fuels. As part of the program, supplier-specific targets and KPIs are set, and related actions are followed up for each participating supplier, resulting in visible improvements in their operations. The suppliers are also offered training and exclusive access to development tools. These include professional training related to the different areas of sustainability, the sharing of inspirational case studies and best practices, and having a dialogue and giving guidance on how to proceed with the issues. The suppliers are also provided access to a capacity-building library with concrete de - velopment tools, e-learnings and practical handbooks, which aim to increase awareness and give practical advice on how to develop more sustainable business practices. In the future, the plan is also to invite Valmet's most CO-inten - sive suppliers to join the program to support them in setting and aligning with these emission reduction targets. The program has given the participating suppliers knowledge and tools to evaluate their sustainability impacts and performance, and to take tangible improvement actions. It has also created add - ed value by engaging new customers, increasing order volumes from existing customers, and enhancing employee engagement and visibly improved operational safety. In 2021, the sustainability engagement program was launched in North and South America. 62valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainable supply chainSuccessfully auditing suppliers remotely during COVID-19 Every year, we carry out sustainability on-site audits for our suppliers with a certified third-party auditor. Due to COVID-19, we created a credible approach to conducting audits remotely. For example, Valmet has been active in sustainability remote audits in Brazil. Lu\u00eds Fernando Silva, Valmet's Supply Analyst, has been involved in many on-site and remote audits. \"During COVID-19 travel restrictions, the remote auditing has brought us savings in travel time and expenses. Moreover, some suppliers see remote audits as more dynamic, because there are fewer distractions. And if we are missing any information, it is quick to add someone else to the virtual meeting.\" Remote audits are organized virtually. The suppliers send specific sustainability-related documents such as licenses and certifications to the auditor beforehand. The audit includes a virtual tour at the supplier's premises, as well as interviews with suppliers' personnel. Finally, Valmet's contact person, the auditor and the supplier discuss the findings. In general, Silva sees the remote audits as successful. However, once the travel restrictions are lifted, Valmet will favor on-site audits, because remote audits do not necessarily suit all the suppliers. And as the remote audit provides a single snapshot, it can sometimes be difficult to form the big picture together. \"Of course, meeting people in person is useful, as it is easier to learn more about each other. Hopefully, in the future, we can utilize both remote and on-site audits, as well as hybrid models, whichever works best for the specific case.\" read more: valmet.com/supplychain 63valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | sustainable supply chainHealth, safety and environment Nothing is more important to us than that our people and partners come home healthy and safe at the end of every workday. In 2021, we continued our strong COVID-19 management approach, put in place lifting safety improvements and took concrete steps in our own operations toward environmental targets. We strive to protect people and promote sustainability in all our activities. We do this by investing in a positive safety culture, col - laborating with customers and partners, and constantly improving our processes and practices toward our common goal of zero harm. During 2021, we continued our strong efforts to keep our people, partners and communities safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic, while keeping our operations running and delivering products and services to our customers. Our strict COVID-19 protocols were followed at all our Valmet locations and cus - tomer sites. We also supported the global vaccination effort by distributing vaccines through our occupational health services. For example, our occupational health service administered more than 1,000 vaccination doses in Finland. To ensure our travelers were kept healthy and safe while traveling to customer sites, we partnered with global medical and security service providers. We have made consistent progress in improving health and safe - ty in Valmet, and by the end of the year, our lost time incident frequency rate (LTIF) for our own employees was its lowest ever, at 1.4 (1.5). However, there is more to do. Regrettably, a fatal con - tractor injury was reported during installation work at Valmet's customer site in India. A thorough investigation was conducted in cooperation with the customer, contractor and the authorities, and corrective actions were taken. The lessons learned were shared with project and site managers globally. Securing contractor safe - ty on customer sites remains a key focus for us. Valmet designs and operates its facilities to promote the sustain - able use of resources, minimize waste and prevent pollution. All production locations act to implement our climate program and reduce water usage and landfill waste. Another focus in 2021 has been the integration of recently acquired businesses with our en - vironmental management practices. Together we make a difference We believe that open and continuous communication on HSE issues is the foundation for a strong safety culture. Our global Safety Dialogue training aims to facilitate these conversations as an ongoing practice in all our teams. It is Valmet's largest training initiative to date, and 91 percent of all our people had participated in it by the end of 2021. We will continue the Safety Dialogue in the future as part of the onboarding process for all new employees. We will also provide managers and their teams with refresher training during 2022, focusing on wellbeing, work- life integration and the key practices in Valmet to promote HSE wherever we work. We expect everyone in our work community to take responsibil - ity for a safe, healthy and well-managed workplace wherever we operate. Managers at Valmet lead the way, with HSE an integral part of business management, annual plans, business strategy and target setting. To support our HSE efforts, we conduct sev - eral global awareness events every year. In 2021, we participated in the WWF Earth Hour for the twelfth consecutive year in 100 locations in 21 countries. We also organized our annual HSE week for the tenth time and renewed the concept by arranging both local activities and virtual events to enable widespread participation globally. Engaging our partners in an HSE discussion is a critical element of our contractor management approach. Every year, we hold several Contractor HSE days, during which we align safety commitment and expectations with our main site suppliers in various customer delivery projects. During 2021, we also launched a new program of Supplier HSE days in China to share good HSE practices with key manufacturing suppliers. These events are appreciated by our partners, and our plan is to implement them more widely in the coming years. Lifting safety improvement program Another major initiative we took in 2021 was to implement a lift - ing safety improvement program in our roll service workshops. Developed and piloted in China, the program was then rolled out globally. The initiative included the formation of local lifting safety improvement teams, analyzing recent lifting events for root 64valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | health, safety and environment1 Data from the 2020 acquisitions are included for the first time in 2021 reporting. 2 Baseline 2019 calculated based on emission data from 2019 and data from acquisitions from 2019 and 2020.

The Pulp and Energy business line also created a lifting safety awareness week for customer project sites, during which inspec - tions and other awareness activities engaged everyone on site to focus on safe lifting. As the next step, we will initiate a working at height improvement program in 2022 for both our workshops and sites. We will also renew our minimum safety standard and life-saving rules. Our global management system taking us forward Valmet's global management system (GMS) provides a platform for continuous improvement, as well as standardized quality and HSE management in all our operations. The targets and improve - ment initiatives are aligned across all units and locations to drive development toward our strategic HSE objectives. During 2021, a new global process handbook was launched to further support harmonized ways of working. Currently, 85 Valmet locations are included in our global multi-site ISO certification to ISO quality and HSE standards. We progressed well with our certification road - map and certified nine additional locations to the ISO 45001:2018 and ISO 14001:2015 standards. For the first time, our health and safety standard certification now covers more than 70 percent of our employees. Our goal is that 90 percent of all employees will work in operations certified by all three standards by 2025 (see the table on page 65 for the current coverage). In addition to external auditing, all our locations are internally audited regularly to ensure that global processes are implemented systematically everywhere. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also developed virtual auditing and inspections of both our locations and customer sites. At the end of 2020, we launched a new global tool for reporting, managing and analyzing HSE and quality events, as well as audits, inspections, risks and lessons learned. During 2021, we supported the use of the tool by giving further training, driving system de - velopment and enhancing data analytics. Adoption of the tool has been active across the organization, and at least 33,000 HSE ob - servations were made by our people and partners, and more than 3,250 HSE walks, inspections and conversations were conducted by our managers and reported in the tool. In the future, we will promote the tool's external reporting portal to engage external stakeholders and develop our HSE analytics dashboards. 66valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | health, safety and environmentMaking the site safer together Every year, Valmet holds several Contractor HSE days to align safety commitment and expectations with key site suppliers. \"Contractor HSE days are an excellent forum for sharing good practices and learning from each other, supporting us in reaching the common target of zero incidents on our customer sites,\" says Victoria Larsson, Valmet's Vice President for Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). In February 2021, a Contractor HSE day was organized for the Mets\u00e4 Board Husum site in Sweden. This time, the event was organized virtually due to COVID-19-related restrictions. Modern tools, video connections and group discussions were used to enable effective collaboration. The advantage of a virtual event was that it enabled more people to participate than a traditional in-person activity. Participants from Mets\u00e4 Group, Valmet and multiple supplier companies attended the event. Valmet introduced its latest HSE developments and encouraged discussions about developing a common safety culture. The contractors then presented what Valmet best practices they had implemented. A virtual safety walk was also part of the agenda, which enabled the participants to list HSE observations and improvements from the site. At the end of the event, all participants made their safety promise. \"The event received very positive feedback from the participants. People were actively collaborating to take safety forward, and the virtual safety work and virtual groupwork were especially appreciated,\" says Suvi Reinikka, Global Category Manager for site works and services, Valmet. read more: valmet.com/hse 67valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | health, safety and environment14,246 EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY 81% OURVOICE RESPONSE RATE 5,958 SPOT AND SPECIAL REWARDS GRANTED 68valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | people and performanceWe have created a strong foundation for people development and top performance, and our people around the world are committed to moving our customers' performance forward. In 2021, Valmet ran its fifth OurVoice employee engagement survey. Overall engagement and performance excellence levels remained stable compared to previous years, with a slight increase in questions related to company values. The survey was renewed with a new question set, survey platform and benchmarks. The re - newed question set was designed to capture key trends, align with new external benchmarks, and incorporate questions on topics important to our company, such as diversity, health and safety, and sustainability. In total, 81 percent of Valmeteers participated in the survey. Working together continued to be the highest scoring item, fol - lowed by understanding company strategy and the ability to do interesting work. High marks were also given for the company's ability to keep people safe and healthy. Areas for improvement included support for managing change and maintaining work-life balance, both of which were chosen as global focus areas for the improvement actions based on this 2021 survey. Team discussions and action planning continues to be an import - ant part of the OurVoice survey cycle. The new OurVoice survey platform supports effective action planning by suggesting the most impactful actions and supporting systematic action plan follow-up. In total, more than 1,200 teams used the platform to set at least one action based on the survey. Building a high-performance culture Valmet continues to develop a pay-for-performance culture in line with our remuneration principles of driving high performance, compensation to retain talent with the right fit, and fairness and sustainability. Since implementing a new people management sys - tem in 2018, we have been increasingly using data to guide com - pensation-related decision making through dashboards, process improvements and manager training. The result is a more strate - gic salary planning process which ensures that salary increases are targeted at our high performers, especially those at the low end of the salary range. In 2021, we continued with the spot and special reward program and HighFive feedback, sending more than 12,500 feedbacks and granting 5,958 rewards. Annual review and mid-year review dis - cussions were completed by 98 percent of white-collar employees, with additional target-setting guidance for key roles resulting in higher quality targets overall. Strengthening the manager role Valmet's manager role forms the foundation of how we engage, develop and drive the performance of individuals and teams across the company. In 2021, we took steps to further develop managerial and leadership skills by creating a senior manager role description and introducing a leadership index as part of the OurVoice 2021 renewal. General managerial skill development continued through online learning and best practice sharing. For online learning, we kicked off a three-part compensation and benefits training, introduced a diversity and inclusion e-learning, and arranged access to a new virtual learning library with 16,000+ online courses. For best practice sharing, we introduced content on resilience and change, remote work, and work-life integration. In-person Forward for Managers training programs were mostly postponed in 2021. Finding the right balance Work situations differed across the company in 2021, with some employees fully remote, some hybrid and some in the office, in our production facilities or on customer sites. Different work situations require managers, teams and individuals to place more emphasis on staying engaged and connected and maintaining balance. To support managers and employees in these areas, we embedded additional opportunities for dialogue into the strategy team discussions and annual review discussions; we launched a new site on work-life integration with materials on staying connected, adapting to change, managing workload, professional growth, life goals and healthy lifestyle; and we focused on self-leadership skill People and performance Valmet's more than 14,000 employees come together every day to serve our customers, live our values, deliver business results and keep our workplace safe. Working together continued to be a clear strength for us in 2021. 69valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | people and performance0 5 10 15 20 25 30 2020 2021Service years, % <1 1-2 3-4 5-10 11-20 21 0 510 15 20 2021Age structure, % 19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-64 65 0 510 15 20 25 30 35 2021Education structure, % Doctoral degree Master's degree Bachelor's degree Technical diploma College degree Special diploma High school diploma Basic education UnallocatedPERSONNEL DATA development with new e-learnings on self-care, stress, work-life balance and time management. Additionally, work-life integration was identified as a global focus area following the OurVoice 2021 survey, for which actions will be executed during 2022. One of the first actions identified is to include a new question on work-life integration in the 2022 annual review discussion process to encourage active dialogue between managers and their team members on the topic. Building capabilities for the future Ensuring we have the right resources in the right place at the right time is critical to our success. In 2021, we included a specific section in the strategy planning process on competences and re - sources, allowing management teams to identify the capabilities needed to execute our strategy. The key outcomes of the work were used as input for resource planning and to set talent development and talent acquisition priorities, including university partnerships and trainee programs. Valmet ran four global training programs in 2021 - Champions in Services, Leading through Lean, Excellence in Project Manage - ment and Innovation Pathways. The programs were complement - ed by active internal mobility, a global mentoring program with 70 pairs, and a variety of business line and area-specific development programs on topics such as tacit knowledge transfer, leadership, remote and matrix management, chief engineer competence de - velopment, Industrial Internet, and process technology. Developing a strong talent pool It is important for us to create opportunities for people to grow and develop within Valmet. We use our talent review process to identi - fy, evaluate and develop managerial, successor and high-potential resources. This year, we took steps to create data-led insights on how our talent and successor pools are developing, and how well we have been able to support talents and successor candidates in growing to their full potential. Our efforts to promote Valmet as an attractive employer continue to pay off. Valmet was included in employer ranking surveys in many of our key markets. We were named the second most attrac - tive employer among engineering professionals in Finland. The increasingly active job market, especially toward the end of the year, prompted us to re-evaluate and accelerate our recruitment process. In 2021, we launched a new careers webpage, introduced a recruitment dashboard and new ready-made templates, held best-practice sharing sessions for recruiters, and renewed our orientation e-learning - all to ensure a smooth onboarding and the best possible welcome to the Valmet team. 70valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | people and performanceChampions in Services - a global training program to target business growth Champions in Services focuses on developing Valmet's strategic capabilities, supporting the growth of Valmet's Automation and Services businesses and enabling the implementation of Valmet's Way to Serve. The program was organized in a virtual format in 2021. Champions in Services brings Valmet's services professionals together to understand the full potential of our stable businesses and create growth by learning together. The program focuses on areas such as growing markets, portfolio management, digitalization and managing the customer experience. A program highlight is working with real-life customer cases and creating a great customer experience. \"Champions in Services is Valmet's most significant training program for driving business growth. The program worked well in a virtual format, and in the future, we are planning a hybrid model, leveraging the benefits from both virtual and in-person learning. The participating customers were also very pleased with the outcomes of the program, and the discussions with Valmet's experts led on many occasions to real project negotiations and even execution,\" says Santeri Heinonen, Valmet's Senior Manager, Global Talent Development. Gregory Fralic, Valmet's Senior Application Specialist in the Industrial Internet team, was one of the program's 36 participants. \"Since the training, I've since focused more in customer research at the beginning of the sales phase and on emphasizing customer value instead of the technical solution alone. I have also started to collaborate more with other business lines.\" read more: valmet.com/people-and-performance 71valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy | people and performanceAs a global company and a recognized sustainability leader in our industry, we collaborate with stakeholders in a highly multi - cultural environment and enhance sustainable business practices throughout our value chain. We aim to ensure that all our oper - ations comply with laws and regulations in a socially responsible and globally aligned manner. Our growing presence in emerging markets emphasizes our responsibility toward local communities. With global operations, we provide employment and business opportunities and indirectly build well-being in local societies. By delivering more sustainable and cost-competitive solutions and services to our customers, we can generate added value for our shareholders and support the global efforts to combat climate change. Social responsibility work continued Valmet strives to be a responsible corporate citizen by under - standing the needs and expectations of local communities. We participate in selected local programs around the world based on our Guidelines for Sponsorships and Donations. As part of its social responsibility program, Valmet continued to support Save the Children's Child Sensitive Social Protection Project in Dun - garpur, India. The cooperation started in the beginning of 2020. The project aims to increase school attendance, reduce child labor and develop the circumstances of poor and vulnerable children. All these objectives perfectly align with our key theme, Equal Opportunities for Wellbeing. During the year, Valmet also continued its traditional support for non-governmental humanitarian organizations working locally in youth activities, environmental protection, and research and education. Our seasonal donation is annually selected by our em - ployees, and in 2021, it was directed to Plan International. Due diligence framework to manage social impacts Valmet is committed to the United Nations (UN) Guiding Princi - ples on Business and Human Rights, and we express our engage - ment in our Human Rights Statement. We have a comprehensive due diligence framework to monitor and manage social impacts related to our own operations and our supply chain. In addition to human rights statement, it includes social impact assessments and their findings, action plan creation and monitoring progress. Valmet annually communicates the progress and provides a remedy if required. The social impact management is also integrated into other processes such as the country sustainability risk assessment, the global supplier sus - tainability management process, and the sustainability agenda review process. We have a location-specific social impact assessment process for high-risk locations. Valmet has conducted three local assessments in its own operations in Thailand, Indonesia and China, which were carried out by an independent third party. The findings were mainly related to health, safety and environmental management, and sustainable supply chain management. The corrective actions regarding the findings have been completed and verified. In 2021, we conducted a third-party evaluation of our social impact management framework, which includes a review of our social impacts management process and salient issues, as well as benchmarks, analysis and developing the assessment of potential negative indirect impacts on nearby communities. The target is to ensure full alignment with the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The work will continue in 2022. Active engagement with stakeholders We promote transparency in our communications and actively engage with our stakeholders. For example, we communicate about our development through the company website, reports and stakeholder events. Sustainability topics are also part of our customer and other stakeholder surveys. In 2021, we conducted a survey as part of our sustainability agenda renewal to gather perspectives and feedback on our sustainability work from internal and external stakeholders.

The majority of the respondents assessed Valmet's sustainability performance as excellent or very good. We also analyzed the changes in the business environment as part of our sustainability agenda renewal. According to the analysis, the key drivers for Valmet's sustainability approach are sustain - able finance and taxonomy, climate change mitigation, business ethics and due diligence, adapting to changing regulation, and supporting the circular economy and biodiversity. Position among the world's sustainability leaders Valmet reports to several third-party sustainability ratings. Over the years, we have been recognized for our actions and strategy in mitigating climate change, and for our management and report - ing of sustainability actions.

In 2021, Valmet received the B rating in CDP Climate. Financial community's increased interest in sustainability The financial community's interest in sustainability and responsi - ble (ESG) investing has continued to increase. We have therefore included information in our investor relations communication on our approach to sustainability and our role in responding to sus - tainability-related global challenges such as climate change and replacing fossil-based raw materials with renewables. In 2021, we organized a record number of virtual meetings with our financial stakeholders to introduce our role and progress in the transition to a carbon neutral economy. We continued to develop our climate-related financial disclosures in accordance with Task Force on Climate-related Financial Dis - closures (TCFD) reporting. In 2021, we analyzed the potential long-term climate-related risks and opportunities and the finan - cial impact on our value chain with different scenarios to support strategy and the capability of adapting to and mitigate climate change. The full TCFD report is available on Valmet's website. Valmet also prepared for the EU's Taxonomy-related reporting requirements on climate change adaptation and mitigation and will continue the work in 2022.

COVID-19 has created severe challenges not only regarding children's learning, but also their health, nutrition and protection, which the schools support. Since many parents have lost their jobs, the risk of child labor has also increased as families search for additional sources of income. Due to the pandemic, social protection has become more important than ever in India. \"The situation in India has hit everyone hard, but children have been affected most and have been exposed to vulnerabilities in many different ways, because many have lost the possibility of an education and been engaged in child labor. Even in this crisis with all its restrictions, we haven't sat still,\" says Neema Pant, Save the Children's Project Manager at the Dungarpur Child Sensitive Social Protection project. Save the Children's project activities have been adjusted to meet the current needs of the children and their families. \"Our project team has especially focused on identifying children who are at risk of being engaged in harmful child labor. The team has also shared information on the COVID-19 situation within communities and organized additional \"catch-up\" classes for both teachers and children to support their learning and safe return to school,\" says Katja Selkim\u00e4ki-Gray, Save the Children's Portfolio Manager for Asia. read more: valmet.com/corporate-citizenship 75valmet | annual review 2021 | strategy firstname.lastname@valmet.com WWW.VALMET MEDIA CONTACTS media@valmet.com RELATIONS ir@valmet.com ORDER OR UNSUBSCRIBE PUBLICATIONS www.valmet.com/subscribeValmet reports 2021 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2021 AND INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS The report includes Valmet's Financial Statements for 2021 and information about its share, shareholders and management.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2021 The report covers Valmet's governance principles and activities, Board of Directors and management in 2021.REMUNERATION REPORT 2021 The report covers Valmet's remuneration principles and remuneration in 2021.GRI SUPPLEMENT 2021 The report includes Valmet's sustainability reporting indicators and principles, and its alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards framework in 2021.ANNUAL REVIEW 2021 The report covers Valmet's market environment and the progress of its strategy, operations and sustainability in 2021.
