Before you arrive for your first session, I will ask you to fill out a brief intake form. This will include your goals and intentions that will inform the sessions. During an energy healing session, you will be fully clothed, laying on your back on a treatment table. You are not asked to do anything during a session except clear your mind, relax, and enjoy. Treatment experiences will vary, ranging from a feeling of warmth and tingling throughout your body, a sensation of lightness or heaviness, or simply being very relaxed. Feel free to take a nap! Energy healing is a holistic practice that activates the body's subtle energy system to remove obstructions and imbalances. I will be touching you on the chakra points as well as on the head and feet. I will go over where the chakras are located and my hand placement with you before beginning. During the session, I will move around the table to clear your energy body. There may be long periods of time where I remain in one place. If you have any questions or feel uncomfortable at any time, you will always be encouraged to say so. Each energy session is one hour. Anything said during a session is confidential. After a session, clients often describe feeling relaxed and energized. If you are interested, at the end of a session, I will teach skills that help deepen the healing. After a few sessions, I will create a protocol that you can do at home to extend your healing experience. How many sessions will I need? Maybe you need a number, but that depends... - Do you want homework? It isn't necessary, but it can propel you forward. - Do you stuff your feelings? Energy work can bring up uncomfortable issues. Let's deal with them and learn constructive and adaptive ways to move forward. "}
