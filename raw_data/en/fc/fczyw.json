Used wisely, with respect, gratitude, and intention, they help us to deepen our sense of connectedness to Spirit and cultivate trust in our own inner wisdom. In this session, we will explore ways to use herbs such as white sage, grandmother cedar, cronewort/mugwort and rose as teas, tinctures, infusions, anointing oils, ointments, smokes and baths - to help open our \"third eye,\" guide our dreams and trance journeys, create safe and sacred space and evoke healing visions in meditation, ritual and ceremony. A Winter Solstice Ritual Celebration In the third session, please join us in a virtual community gathering to celebrate the Solstice season, as we head toward the shortest day and longest night of the year. We will invoke sacred space and help turn the Wheel of the Year with song, story, and candlelight. Come rest and dream in the safety of deep darkness; a journey within to conceive the authentic spark of your own unique light and life; call forth the inner gifts you wish to rebirth in the spring; and celebrate the magical rhythms of nature that unite us all, whatever our spiritual tradition!
