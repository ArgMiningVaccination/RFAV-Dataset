Do you people have no trust on ayurvedic medicine? I red you people are also fighting a court case to get permission for practicing allopathy. Do you think you people are inferior to modern medicine?? I have seen soo many BAMS doctors working in hospitals practicing modern medicine as a cheap labour so do you think it's unethical. In my place maximum bams doctors practice only modern medicine given injectable high dose antibiotics for just 1 day history of fever. Giving steroids to everyone as if it's a candy. I just want to know why bams are practicing allopathic medicine. I am not against any form of medicine. But if you have studied ayurveda then why not practicing it. Please don't get offended it's just a question. Answers (5) Like the answers?

You are right, ayurved doctor must and should practice ayurveda. But it is not possible for everyone, everywhere...villagers don't bother whether doctor is ayurvedic or allopathic, they insist for injection...n doctor doesn't want to loose the patient. What people demand that will b served. Patient is also happy n doctor too. And practicing allopathy for few years definitely doctor forgets ayurveda...... It may be temporary gain for doctor but huge loss to ayurved.. Mr. Delhi, I think you are a socially aware person this is a great thing. now let me tell you the truth approx 60% of BAMS doctors practicing in GP as per my experience, they just take degrees for money only not for serve humanity through Ayurveda Medicine and treatment, even they learn 4 to five, they have given exams but they are not confident about Ayurveda, they just want money doesn't matter how and where from coming.

Ayurveda Treatment and medicine are very advanced powerful techniques have but people just want quick temporary relief, Modern medicine is not bad but the thing is when required more that time only should use. Even now Indian government and other countries advising to Allopathy doctors to use Ayurveda (Traditional medicine) Also. Everyone has to be aware of medicine and profession, also patients should to ask, if you are an Ayurveda doctor then why prescribe Allopathic medicine at least you should give 70% Ayurvedic medicines. First of all its none of ur concern... U can see the ayurvedic doctor who is giving ayurvedic medicine only, there are several ayurvedic doctor who only practice Ayurveda... Purely Ayurveda.. And i mean it... I do 100% Ayurveda... Consult me if u have any problem... Will give u Purely ayurvedic medicine..
