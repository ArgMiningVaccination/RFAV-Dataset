Vol. 12-9Preface The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-only, online monthly publication of the Office of the Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administ ration, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rule making notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative documents aff ecting rules that are statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-related documents an agency may want to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to provide public notice of all proposed rulemaking actions and must invite public input once formal rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated formal rulemaking procedures through the Idaho Administrativ e Bulletin and a Public Notice of Intent (legal notice) that publishes in specific newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to participate when a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request pub lic hearings of the agency if none have b een scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be presented to the agen cy within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rulemaking\" for each proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the ag ency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed ru le at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowt h\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislative review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be fo rwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when the agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar year and issue number. For example, Bulletin 11-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2011 ; Bulletin 12-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2012 . Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 12-1 refers to January 2012; V olume No. 12-2 refers to February 2012; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin published in January 2011 is cited as Volume 11-1. The December 2011 Bulletin is cited as V olume 11-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE I DAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online comp ilation of all final and enforceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full force and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Ad ministrative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legisla tive session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules ar e codified into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enfo rceable, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Administrative Code. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by th e Administrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions. At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as temporary rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies often engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building in controversial or complex rulemakings. In the majority of cases, the process begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The followi ng is a brief explanation of each type of administrative rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 6 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested parties and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule. Agencies are encouraged, and in some cases requir ed, to engage in this rulemaking activity whenever it is feasible to do so. Publication of a \"Notice of Intent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" in the Administrative Bulletin by the agency is optional. This process normally results in the formulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of formal rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that formal rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. The rulemaking effectively stops before it gets started. PROPOSED RULEMAKING A proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the agency is proposing to am end or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to th e adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agency must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice must include: a) the specific statutory authority (from Idaho Code) for the rulemaking including a citation to a specific federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; b) a statement in nontechnical language of the subs tance of the proposed rule, including a specific description of any fee or charge imposed or increased; c) a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided, however, that notwithstanding Sec tion 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the rule. d) the text of the proposed rule prepared in legislative format; e) the location, date, and time of any public hearings the agency intends to hold on the proposed rule; f) the manner in which persons may make written comments on the proposed rule, including the name and address of a person in the agency to wh om comments on the proposal may be sent; g) the manner in which persons may request an opportunity for an oral presentation as provided in Section 67-5222, Idaho Code; and h) the deadline for public (written) comments on the proposed rule. Any proposed rulemaking that is submitted for publication in the Bulletin that would impose a fee or charge must be accompanied by a cost/benefit analysis th at is prepared by the agency. This cos t/benefit analysis must estimate, as reasonably as possible, the costs to th e agency to implemen t the rule and the estimated co sts that would be borne by citizens or the private sector. This analys is is filed with the Director of Legisl ative Services Office who then forwards it to the appropriate germane joint subcommittee assigned to review the promulgating agency's proposed rules. When incorporating by reference, the notice of proposed rulemaking must include a brief synopsis detailing the need to incorporate by reference any additional materials into the rule. The agency must also provide information regarding access to the incorporated materials. At a mini mum, and when available, th e agency must provide an electronic link to the documents that can accessed on a website or post this information on its own website, or both. This link can be placed into the ru le and activated once it is posted on the Coordinator's website. As stated, the text of the proposed rule must be published in the Bulletin. After meeting the statutory rulemaking criteria for a proposed rule, the agency may adopt the pend ing rule. Because a proposed rule is not enforceable, it has no effective date, even when published in conjunction with a temporary rule that is of fu ll force and effect. An agency may vacate (terminate) a rulemaking after th e publication of a proposed rule if it decides, for whatever reason, not to proceed further to finalize the rulemaking. The publication of a \"Notice of Vacation of Proposed Rulemaking\" in the Bulletin officially stops the formal rulemaking process.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 7 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9TEMPORARY RULEMAKING Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds that it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; orc) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of the above legal criteri a and the governor determines that it is necessary that a rule become effective prior to receivi ng legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input, the agency may proceed and adopt a temporary rule. The law a llows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately effective upon adoption. However, a temporary rule that impo ses a fee or charge may be adopted only if the governor finds that the fee or charge is necessary to avoid an immediate danger which justifies the imposition of the fee or charge. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a final rule, or expires under its own terms. The statute that regulates rulemaking in Idaho requires that the text of all proposed rulemakings publish in the Bulletin in order for the rulemaking to be valid. This is true for all temporary rules as well. In most cases, the agency wants the temporary rule to also become a final rule and in most of these cases, the temporary rule and the proposed rule text is identical. In this event, both rulemakings may be promulgated concurrently yet they remain separate rulemaking actions. The rulemaking is published in the Bulletin as a temporary/proposed rule. Combining the rulemaking allows for a single publication of the text in the Bulletin. An agency may, at any time, rescind a temporary rule th at has been adopted and is in effect. The agency must publish a notice of rescission to effectively rescind the temporary rule. If the temporary rule is being replaced by a new temporary rule or if it has been published concurrently with a proposed rule that is being vacated, the agency, in most instances, will rescind the temporary rule. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforceable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes: a) a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule; b) a statement of any change between the text of the proposed rule and the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for any changes; c) the date the pending rule will become final and effective and a statement that the pending rule may be rejected, amended or modified by co ncurrent resolution of the legislature; d) an identification of any portion of the rule impo sing or increasing a fee or charge and a statement that this portion of the rule shall not become fi nal and effective unless affirmatively approved by concurrent resolution of the legislature; (e) the specific statutory authority for the rulemaking including a citation to the specific section of the Idaho Code that has occasioned the rulemaking, or the federal statute or regulation if that is the basis of authority or requirement for the rulemaking; andIDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 8 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9(f) a specific description, if applicable, of any nega tive fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective; provided however, that notwithstanding section 67-5231, Idaho Code, the absence or accuracy of a fiscal impact statement provided pursuant to this subsection shall not affect the validity or the enforceability of the rule. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pendi ng rule when substantive chan ges have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies in content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending rule change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that me mbers of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pending rule. With the permission of the Rules Coordinator, only the sections or their subparts that have changed from the proposed text are republished. If no changes have been made to the previously published text, it is not required to republish the text again and only the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Adoption of Pending Rule\" is published. FINAL RULEMAKING A final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. No pending rule adopted by an agency becomes final and effective until it has been submitted to the legislature for review and approval. Where the legislature finds that an agency has violated the legislative intent of the authorizing statute, a concurrent resolution may be adopted to reject the rulemaking in whole or in part. A \"Notice of Rulemaking - Final Rule\" and the final codified text must be published in the Bulletin for any rule that is wholly or partially rejected by concurrent resolution of the legislature. Unless rejected by concurrent resolution, a pending rule that is reviewed by the legislature becomes final and effectiv e at the end of the session in which it is reviewed without any further legislative action. All pending rules that are ap proved by concurrent resolutio n become final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution unless otherwise stated. In no event can a pending rule become final and effective before the conclusion of the regular or special legislative session at which the rule was submitted for review. However, a rule that is final and effective may be applied retroactively, as provided in the rule.

Each state agency ha s a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphab etical/numerical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text is divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as follows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrative Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05, which is the Department of Administrations's Division of Purchasing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket number is a series of a two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The fo llowing example is a breakdown of a typical rule docket \"DOCKET NO. 38-0501-1201\" \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule bein g promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1201\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being published; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2012 . A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2012 would be designated as \" 1202 \". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501- 1202 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections aff ected are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the sequence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 September 5, 2012 -

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 25-2710, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Add a new section, 011 - Exemptions, to define those feed products that will be exempt from registration. Add a new section, 020 - Registration & Fees, to set in rule a fee of $45 per product. Add a subsection, 050.01.h., to include in the definition of \"labeling\" all statements and promotion on company websites or other internet-based customer interfaces. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: The agency facilitated three negotiated rulemaking meetings on July 11, July 18, and August 1, 2012. In these meetings, participants provided input on each of the new sections referenced above. The temporary rule is important in order to provide a registration fee for new and renewed products. Without the temporary rule, the program would be unable to register products and provide funding for program activities. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: The registration fee included in this temporary rule is authorized in Section 25-2704(2), which authorizes the Director to set a registration fee in rule. This authorization is the result of SB 1236, which was passed by the 2012 Idaho Legislature. Changes to the statute included the authori zation to set the registration fee in rule, as well as the elimination of the tonnage fee. The registration fee is set at $45 per product. This is an increase in the per product registration fee of $5 or $25. The new registration fee also replaces the former tonnage fee requirement. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: The commercial feed program is a dedicated fund program and there is no impact to the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the June 6, 2012 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, V olume 12-6, Page 14 .

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 54-1907, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In 2012, a new classification of public works contr actor licensing (PWCL) was cr eated in Section 54-1904, Idaho Code, called a \"Class CC\" license. This new class of li cense was brought forward in response to requests from contractors and public agencies in an attempt to broaden the base of qualified contractors available to bid on construction projects in the $200,000 to $400,000 range. Many contractors wanted to be able to bid on projects in this range, but were unable to qualify for the B license due to fi nancial requirements. The CC license allows a contractor to perform work on public works involving an estimated co st of not more than $400,000. Section 54-1904 allows the Public Works Contractor Licensing Board to establish rule s to determine in which classification a contractor is qualified to engage in public works construction according to each applicant's responsibility and scope of operations. Accordingly, by rule all classifications have minimum financial requirements and amendment must be made to include the new Class CC. Additionally, Section 54-1904 only establishes a maximum initial and renewal fee for each classification of license; accordingly, actual fees for the Class CC license still must be established in rule. Finally, rule section related to financial statements submitted with an application for licensure must account for the new CC classification of licensure. The rulemaking establishes minimum financial requirements for obtaining and maintaining a Class CC license in the amount of $75,000 of net worth and $25,000 of working capital. Additionally, it establishes an initial and renewal license fee for the Class CC license in the amount of $125. Finally, it requires financial statements submitted with an application for a Class CC license to be accompanied by an independent audit report or reviewed or compiled by a certified public accountant. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a) and (b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: The Legislature, in its last session, approved the new CC class license predicated on the need for the new class. The Public Works Contractor Licensing Board must, by admi nistrative rule, establish the license fee and financial requirements before it can be implemented. House Bill 465 reflected a maximum license fee of $150, and the projected financial requirements were included in the Statement of Purpose and addr essed with the legislative committees when the legislation was co nsidered. This rulemaking reflects the agreed-upon fees and financial requirements. Quick implementation of this CC class license is in the best interest of the public's health and safety because of the benefits from having more qualified contr actors participating in biddi ng construction projects or subcontracts within the $200,000 to $400,000 range which aids in ensuring the safe and efficient construction of public works. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: The rulemaking establishes minimum financial requirements for obtaining and maintaining a Class CC license in the amount of $75,000 of net worth and $25,000 of working capital. Additionally, it establishes an initial and renewal license fee for the Class CC license in the amount of $125.DIVISION OF BUILDING SAFETY Docket No. 07-0501-1201 Rules of the Public Works Contractors Licensing Board Temporary & Proposed Fee Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 23 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: No anticipated impact to the Division or applicants for li censure in the aggregate, as any upgrades from C to CC would likely be offset by downgrades from B to CC. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because of the need for temporary rulemaking pu rsuant to amendments to governing law passed by the 2012 Idaho Legislature.

(3-20-04)Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 27 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9IDAPA 07 - DIVISION OF BUILDING SAFETY 07.05.01 - RULES OF THE PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD DOCKET NO. 07-0501-1202 NOTICE OF RULEMAKING - PROPOSED RULE AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5221(1), Idaho Code , notice is hereby given that this agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedures. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 54-1907 and 54-1910(4)(e), Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: As part of the application for a public works contractor's license, an applicant must submit an annual financial statement, among other items. The current rule requires the applicant to submit a financial statement that details the financial condition of the applicant. However, the language contained in the rule requires only that the statement was issued within the 12 months prior to submission of th e application. Recently, the Division has received statements issued within the past year that reflect financial data signi ficantly more than a year out-of-date. This change requires that the period of time covered by the financial statement ended within the last 12 months prior to submission of the application. Timely financial data plays a prominent role in determining the qualifications of a Public Works Contractor. The rulemaking would clarify that the annual financial statement required with the application for a public works contractor's license covers a period of tim e ending no more than 12 months prior to the date of submission of the application. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: No financial impact to the Division or applicants for licensure is expected. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the rule is simple in nature. Current financial information plays a critical role in review of a license application, and the original rule was formulated to address this. The new verbiage simply addresses an unintended administrative loophole that has been exploite d by some applicants. The rulemaking amendment has been discussed at three separate Public Works Contractor Licensing Board meetings during 2012. All affected parties (public entities and licensees) have voiced support for the change. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: N/A ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the proposed rule, contact Steve Keys, Deputy Administrator - Operations at (208) 332-8986.

LIENS AND ESTATE RECOVERY: LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS. 01. Limitations on Estate Claims . Limits on the Department's claim against the assets of a deceased participant or spouse are subject to Sections 56-218 and 56-218A, Idaho Code. A claim against the estate of a spouse of a participant is limited to the value of the assets of the estate that had been, at any time after October 1, 1993, community property, or the deceased participant's share of the separate property, and jointly owned property. Recovery will not be made until the deceased participant no longer is survived by a spouse, a child who is under age twenty-one (21), or a blind or disabled child, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1382c as amended and, when applicable, as provided in Subsection 903.05 of these rules. No recovery will be made if the participant received medical assistance as the result of a crime committed against the participant. (4-7-11) 02. Expenses Deducted From Estate . The following expenses may be deducted from the available assets to determine the amount available to satisfy the Department's claim: (3-30-07) a. Burial expenses, which include only those reason ably necessary for embalming, transportation of the body, cremation, flowers, clothing, and services of the funeral director and staff may be deducted. (3-30-07) b. Other legally enforceable and necessary debts with priority may be deducted. The Department's claim is classified and paid as a debt with preference as defined in Section 15-03-805, Idaho Code. Debts of the deceased participant that may be deducted from the estate prior to satisfaction of the Department's claim must be legally enforceable debts given preference over the De partment's claim under S ection 15-03-805, Idaho Code. (3-30-07) 03. Interest on Claim . The Department's claim does not bear in terest except as otherwise provided by statute or agreement. (3-30-07) 04. Excluded Land . Restricted allotted land, owned by a deceased participant who was an enrolled member of a federally recognized American Indian tribe, or eligible for tribal membership, which cannot be sold or transferred without permission from the Indian tribe or an agency of the Federal Government, will not be subject to estate recovery. (3-30-07) 05. Certain Life Estates . The value of a life estate owned by a Medicaid participant or his or her spouse will not be subject to estate recovery if: ( ) a. Neither the Medicaid participant or his or her spouse ever owned the remainder interest; or ( ) b. The life estate was created prior to July 1, 1995. ( ) 056. Marriage Settlement Agreement or Other Such Agreement . A marriage settlement agreement or other such agreement which separates assets for a marrie d couple does not eliminate the debt against the estate of the deceased particip ant or the spouse. Transfers under a marriage se ttlement agreement or ot her such agreement may be voided if not for adequate consideration. (3-30-07) 067. Release of Estate Claims . The Department will release a claim when the Department's claim has been fully satisfied and may release its cl aim under the following conditions: (3-30-07) a. When an undue hardship waiver as defined in Subsection 905.07 of this rule has been granted; or (4-7-11) b.

Purpose of the Undue Hardship Exception . The undue hardship exception is intended to avoid DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0309-1202 Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 32 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9the impoverishment of the deceased participant's family due to the Department exercising its estate recovery right. The fact that family members anticipate or expect an inheritance, or will be inconvenienced economically by the lack of an inheritance, is not cause for the Depa rtment to declare an undue hardship. (3-30-07) 089. Application for Undue Hardship Waiver . An applicant for an undue hardship waiver must have a beneficial interest in the estate and must apply for the waiver within ninety (90) days of the death of the participant or within thirty (30) days of receiving no tice of the Department's claim, whichever is later.

The estate subject to recovery is income-producing property that provides the primary source of support for other family members; or (3-30-07) b. Payment of the Department's claim would cause heir s of the deceased participant to be eligible for public assistance; or (3-30-07) c.

(3-30-07) d. The participant received medical assistance as the result of a crime committed against the participant. (3-30-07) 1011. Limitations on Undue Hardship Waiver . Any beneficiary of the esta te of a deceased participant may apply for waiver of the estate recovery claim based on undue hardship. Any claim may be waived by the Department, partially or fully, because of undue hardship . An undue hardship does not exist if action taken by the participant prior to his death, or by his legal representative, divested or diverted assets from the estate. The Department grants undue hardship waivers on a case by case basis upon review of all facts and circumstances, including any action taken to diminish assets available for estate recovery or to circumvent estate recovery. (3-30-07) 1 12. Set Aside of Transfers . Transfers of real or personal proper ty of the participant without adequate consideration are voidable and may be set aside by the distri ct court whether or not the asset transfer resulted, or could have resulted, in a period of ineligibility.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 56-202, 56-203, 56-250 through 56-257, and 56-260 through 56-266, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearings concerning this rulemaking will be held as follows: If you are unable to attend a public hearing in any of the physical locations listed above, you can join the Boise public hearing from anywhere in the state via teleconference. Teleconference number: 1-888-706-6468 Participant Code: 526505 The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In 2011, the Idaho Legislature approved the Children's System Redesign. Under the redesign, the Department is moving from a one-size-fits-all system that was only able to deliver therapy, to a system that provides a continuum of care based on the child's level of need. The new array of benefits replaces developmental therapy and intensive behavioral intervention (IBI) services. Removing developmental disabilities benefits from the State Plan directly impacts the school-based service providers who deliver the same services. Rule changes ar e needed to incorporate repl acement services for school- based providers when developmental therapy and IB I are no longer available starting July 1, 2013. The Department has worked in collaboration with the State Department of Education, the Idaho Association of School Administrators, and several other school district representatives as part of a School-Based Medicaid Committee, to identify replacement services (both new an d existing) that can be us ed to address children's developmental disabilities needs in the school setting. While developing these services, the committee kept in mind the purpose of Medicaid funding in the schools and regulations that must be followed under the State Plan authority. The new replacement school-based services are proposed to be implemented on July 1, 2013. Specifically, the following changes are being made: 1. References to DDA services are being removed from this chapter. 2.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: In 2006, the Legislature passed House Bill 833. HB 833 amended the Alcoholism and Intoxication Treatment Act (AITA) to establish the Interagency Committee on S ubstance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ICSA) effective until July 1, 2011. For a five-year period, starting in SFY 2007, budget decisions regarding substance use disorders treatment were made by the Interagency Committee on Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ICSA). In accordance with AITA, ICSA sunsetted at the end of SFY 2011 an d is no longer in existence. As result, the reference to ICSA in these rules needs to be removed. Also, some rule revisions are needed to accommodate the current substance use disorder treatment environment. Treatment providers must now respond to four referral sources, each of which have different treatment and reporting requirements. Finally, provider requirements need to be streamlined to allow the provider system to function in a more efficient manner. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: NA FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: No fiscal impact to the state general fund is anticipated due to this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted. Negotiated rulemaking is not feasible as this change is being made to align this chapter of rules with the ICSA sunset clause in existing statute, and with current practice in substance use disorder treatment. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: No materials are being incorporat ed by reference into these rules.

USE OF CREDIT FACTORS. 01. Prohibited Acts . An insurer shall not charge a higher premium than would otherwise be charged, or cancel, nonrenew or decline to issue a policy, based in any part upon credit factors unless: (3-20-04) a. The decision is also based on a noncredit factor or factors; and (3-20-04) b. The aggregate weight given to the noncredit factors considered in making the decision is at least as great as the aggregate weight given to the credit factors considered in making the decision. (3-20-04) 02. Application of Rule . To determine whether a decision to issue, nonrenew or cancel a policy, or to charge a higher rate than would otherwise be charged, is not improperly based primarily upon a credit factor or factors and in violation of Section 41-1843, Idaho Code , the Department will apply the following criteria: (3-20-04) ( ) a. If an insurer declines to issue, nonrenews or can cels a policy based in any part upon a credit factor, the insurer must be able to show that it also relied upon a noncredit factor or combination of noncredit factors in making the decision and that the noncredit factor(s) played at least as great a role in the decision as did the credit factor. Nothing in this rule is intended to modify or alter any provisions contained in Title 41, Chapter 25, Idaho Code. (3-20-04) ( ) b. If an insurer relies in any part upon a credit factor in establishing an initial rate for new business or to impose an increase in premium rate for a customer , the insurer must be able to show that it also considered noncredit factors in establishing the initial rate and that not more than one-half (\u00bd) of the initial or renewal premium rate is attributable to the credit factor. To satisfy this requirement, an insurer shall do one (1) of the following: (3-20-04) ( ) i. Compare the premium rate using the highest credit factor to the premium rate using the lowest credit factor. The difference in the premiu m rate between the highest and lowest shall be not more than one-half (\u00bd) the highest premium rate; or ( ) ii. Compare a premium rate calculated using the highest credit factor to a premium rate calculated without using credit. The premium rate calculated without using credit shall be equal to or greater than one-half (\u00bd) of the premium rate calculated using the highest credit factor. To calculate the premium rate without using credit, an insurer shall demonstrate that it has applied all the noncre dit factors and replaced the actual credit factor with the average credit factor. The aver age credit factor must be calculated from the actual distribution of Idaho business by credit factor at the time the credit factor rating system was implemented or last revised. For purposes of this Subparagraph, 100.02.b.ii., \"last revised\" means any subsequent changes to the credit factor system utilized by the insurer as part of its overall rate filing. Under this approach, as long as the highest rate charged using a credit factor is not more than double the rate using the average credit factor, the rate will be treated as meeting th e requirements of Section 41-1843, Idaho Code. ( ) c. If an insurer relies in any part upon a credit factor to impose an increase in premium rate for a customer, the insurer must be able to show that the increase was also based upon a change in at least one noncredit factor and that not more than one-half (\u00bd) of the increase is attributable to the credit factor. (3-20-04) 03. Information Used in Reviewing Insurer's Decision . To evaluate whether an underwriting or rating decision was based primarily upon credit factors, the department may require the insurer to explain in detail the insurer's underwriting or rating process, identify all factor s considered in the process, and describe how the process was applied in the case under review. The department may also require the insurer to apply its underwriting or rating process to hypothetical cases submitted to the insurer by the Department.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 61-515, 62-605(5)(b), and 62-622(5), Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explan ation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The IPUC adopted changes to IDAPA 31.41.01.502, effective July 3, 2012, by approving a stipulation signed by IPUC Staff and telephone companies affected by the rule. The proposed change was initiated by the telephone companies who face competitive pressures that did not exist in 1993 when the rule was promulgated. The rule change increases time to restore service when outages occur, eliminates penalty payments , and eliminates automatic reporting requirements. Particular references to Rule 502 in Rule 500 and Rule 501 are deleted to coincide with the changes to Rule 502. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: The change to IDAPA 31.41.01.502 confers an economi c benefit on telephone companies who currently face competition in local telephone markets. The rule change (a) increases time to restore service when outages occur, (b) eliminates penalty payments, and (c) eliminates automatic reporting requirements. Adopting the rule change as temporary allows benefit to be immediately effective. FEE SUMMARY: There are no fees associated with this proposed rulemaking. FISCAL IMPACT: There is no fiscal impact on the state general fund resulting from this rulemaking. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Negotiated rulemaking was conducted through a public workshop on April 30, 2012, and by written comments received by electronic mail. Members of the public and representatives of at least twelve (12) telecommunications companies participated in the informal negotiated rulemaking process. ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMENTS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the proposed rule, contact Weldon B.

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 63-105A, Idaho Code, and Section 63-802, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule: Property Tax Rule 803 needs to be amended to provide instructions to im plement recently enact ed HB 697 with respect to the required use of foregone amount. The levy permitted pursuant to section 63-1305A, Idaho Code, requires that the taxing district first budgets the maximum amount of property tax permitted pursuant to Section 63- 802, Idaho Code, including any foregone amount. This requirement shall be deemed to have been met if, despite additional budget allowed pursuant to Section 63-802, Idaho Code , every fund used by the taxing district levies at the maximum levy rate provided by law, or, if no maximum levy rate is provided, the fund levies the maximum permitted budget amount. To the extent necessary to enable all pr eviously accrued foregone amounts to be levied, the taxing district may need to use additional funds within which it is permitted to levy property taxes before levying as permitted pursuant to Section 63-1305A, Idaho Code. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section(s) 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: Compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid imme diate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary rule, contact Alan Dornfest at (208) 334-7544 .

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 49-201, Idaho Code and based on the requirements established in Section 49-523, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rule- making: This proposal will align a bonded title's brand expiration date with the bond's expiration date, thereby eliminating customer issues that may occur due to the bond expiring pr ior to the brand's expiration date. Subsequently, with the bonded title brand expiring at the same time as the bond, th ere is the concern that the ow ner may apply for the bonded title just before the bond expires. This proposal requires that the owner obtain a bond rider if more than 90 days has passed since the bond was obtained, thereby providing a significant amount of time for the bonded title to be of public record for the protection of any prior owner or lien-holder who still has an interest and is trying to locate the vehicle. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: This rule-making confers a benefit by eliminating customer issues that may occur due to the bond expiring prior to the branded title expiration date. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: There is no fee or charge associated with this rule-making. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no fiscal impact on the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because there is no clearly identified group or or ganization to which this par ticular process would apply. The circumstances associated with requiring a bonded title are considered somewhat uncommon. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: No materials are being incorporated by reference.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rule-m aking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section(s) 40-312 and 49-1004, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rule-making: Sections of existing rule, IDAPA 39.03.10.300.05.a. through 300.05.e., \"Rules Governing When an Overlegal Permit Is Required,\" have been removed and used as the basis for a new rule, IDAPA 39.03.04, \"Rules Governing Movement of Disabled Vehicles,\" to address the movement of vehicles by tow trucks. Language has been updated for better organization and to provide clarity . Industry needs are simply broader th an what would be appropriate in the existing rule, 39.03.10, which addresses when overlegal permits are required. The guidance for movement of disabled vehicles was originally established in a section of this rule which primarily addresses the waiver of permit policy restrictions in emergency situations and was very limited in scope. The new rule provides greater clarity and authority for the industry since their role in providing service to a di sabled vehicle is not always related to an emergency and there are frequently many other elements to consider in the movement of sp ecialized equipment and the loads they may have been transporting. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: At the request of the towing companies and the Idaho Trucking Association, the department has proposed changes that will clarify the role, responsibility and authority of tow trucks and wreckers in the removal of disabled vehicles.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rule-m aking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 40-312(1), Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rule-making: The recently revised 2009 Edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, established certain requirements for sign replacement, includ ing deadlines. In response to concer ns from those impacted, FHWA opted to extend or eliminate certain requirements for sign repl acement, depending on the sign classification. Immediate adoption of the rule confirms those changes for state and local jurisdictions throughout the state, which results in a delayed implementation and delayed fiscal impact. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(b) and (c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the following reasons: This rulemaking adopts the most recent version of the MUTCD, including Revisi ons 1 and 2. Revision 1 contains new definitions for engineering judgment with are consistent with the previously adopted conforming addition allowing us to strike the conforming addition from this rule. The purpose of Revision 2 is to revise certain information relating to target compliance dates for traffic control devices. The final rule revises Table I-2 of the MUTCD by eliminating the compliance dates for 46 items (8 that had already expire d and 38 that had future compliance dates) and extends and/or revises the dates for 4 items. The target compliance dates for 8 items that are deemed to be of critical safety importance will remain in effect. In addition, this final rule adds a new Option statement exempting existing historic street name signs within a locally identified historic district from the Standards and Guidance of Section 2D.43 regarding street sign co lor, letter size, and other design features, including retroreflectivity. Consistent with Executive Order 13563, and in particular its emphasis on burden-reduction and on retrospective analysis of existing ru les, the changes adopted are intended to reduce the costs and impacts of compliance dates on State and local highway agencies and to streamline and simplify the information. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the f ee or charge imposed or increased: There are no fees or charges imposed or increased by this rulemaking. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if app licable, of any negative fi scal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no fiscal impact to the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because this rulemaking is based on a federa l compliance issue which also confers a benefit to users. Federal requirements in this rule were approved by the 2012 Legislature. Requirements for sign replacement have been extended or eliminated depending on the sign classification, resulting in a delayed implementation and delayed fiscal impact to users.IDAHO TRANSPORTATION DEPART MENT Docket No. 39-0341-1201 Rules Governing Traffic Control Devices Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 191 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following is a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: This rulemaking incorporates by reference the 2009 edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, including Revisions 1 and 2, with an effective date of June 13, 2012, with conforming additions as specified in Section 004 of the rule.

IDAHO TRANSPORTATION DEPART MENT Docket No. 39-0341-1201 Rules Governing Traffic Control Devices Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 198 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9If a Crossbuck sign is used on a highway approach to a public highway-LRT grade crossing that is not equipped with the active traffi c control systems that are described in Chapter 8C, a Crossbuck Assembly shall be installed on the right-hand side of the highway on each approach to the highway-LRT grade crossing. Where restricted sight distance or unfavorable highway geometry exists on an approach to a grade crossing that has a Crossbuck Assembly, or where there is a one-way multi-lane approach, an additional Crossbuck Assembly shall be installed on the left-hand side of the highway. Guidance: The use of STOP signs at passive grade crossings should be placed in accordance with Idaho law. Support: Sections 8A.02 and 8A.03 contain information regarding the responsibilities of the highway agency and the railroad company or LRT agency regarding the selection, design, and operation of traffic control devices placed at grade crossings. Option: When a STOP sign is installed for a Crossbuck Assemb ly at a grade crossing, it may be installed on the same support as the Crossbuck sign or it may be installed on a separate support at a point where the highway vehicle is to stop, or as near to that point as practical, but in e ither case, the STOP sign is co nsidered to be a part of the Crossbuck Assembly. Standard: When a STOP sign is installed on an existing Crossbuck sign support, the minimum height, measured vertically from the bottom of the STOP sign to the top of the curb, or in the absence of curb, measured vertically from the bottom of the STOP sign to the elevation of the near edge of the traveled way, shall be four (4) feet (see Figure 8B-2). If a Crossbuck Assembly is installed on a new sign support (see Figure 8B-2) or if the STOP sign is installed on a separate support (see Figure 8B-3), the minimum height, measured vertically from the bottom of the STOP sign to the top of the cu rb, or in the absence of curb, measured vertically from the bottom of the STOP sign to the elevation of the near edge of the tr aveled way, shall be seven (7) feet if the Crossbuck Assembly is installed in an area where parkin g or pedestrian movements are likely to occur. Guidance: If a STOP sign is installed for a Crossbuck Assembly at a grade crossing on a separate support than the Crossbuck sign (see Figure 8B-3), the STOP sign should be placed at a point where the highway vehicle is to stop, or as near that point as practical, but no closer than fi fteen (15) feet measured perp endicular from the nearest rail. Support: Certain commercial motor ve hicles and school buses are required to stop at all grade crossings in accordance with 49 CFR 392.10. The meaning of a Crossbuck Assembly that includes a ST OP sign is that a road user approaching the grade crossing must come to a full and complete stop not less th an fifteen (15) feet short of the nearest rail, and remain stopped while the road user determines if there is rail tr affic either occupying the cros sing or approaching and in such close proximity to the crossing that the road user must yield the right-of-w ay to rail traffic. The road user is permitted to proceed when it is safe to cross.IDAHO TRANSPORTATION DEPART MENT Docket No. 39-0341-1201 Rules Governing Traffic Control Devices Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 199 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9(3-29-12) 197.

The action is authorized pursuant to Section 54-2105, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 19, 2012. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with di sabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The rulemaking will expressly authorize convenient meth ods for filing documents, allow the Board to more fully recover expenses incurred when an application for certi fication is withdrawn, and st reamline and clarify certain obligations and procedures required of Certified Euthanasia Agencies and Certified Euth anasia Technicians for safe, efficient and accountable practice. The rulemaking makes a \"housekeeping\" change by adding the Board's website and e-mail information and simplifying filing requirements; adopts an updated version of the American Veterinary Medical Association's principles of ethics; makes all certifi ed veterinary technician app lication fees nonrefundable; reorganizes existing provisions applicable to a Certifie d Euthanasia Agency (CEA) and a Certified Euthanasia Technician (CET); streamlines and clarifies procedures for a CEA and CET; eliminates any potential ambiguity in the grounds for discipline against a CEA or CET; and provides clarity to the procedures and requirements for addressing deficiencies found during an inspection of a CEA. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if appli cable, of any negative fis cal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: The Board of Veterinary Medicine is a dedicated fund agency; therefore the General Fund will not be impacted by this rulemaking. It is estimated that the Board's dedicat ed fund account either will not be impacted, or that there will be a minimal positive impact of less than $2,000/year. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because it was not feasible for several reasons. First, some of the rulemaking is of a simple, non-controversial nature (e.g., putting the Board's website and e- mail information in rule and simplifying filing options). Second, the change to make all vete rinary technician application fees nonrefundable is consistent with a suggestion made to the Board by a legislative committee du ring 2012 rulemaking; and the change is also consistent with an identical change in statute for veterinarian ap plication fees (thereby treating the two groups the same). Third, the amendments to the euthanasia rules were essentially the product of the Certified Euthanasia Task Force, an entity comprised of veterina rians and technicians involved in animal euthanasia practices in the state; therefore, input, comments and recommendations from thes e professionals in the affected field was considered in drafting the rulemaking. Fourth, the changes clarify arguably ambiguous or vague procedures, thereby benefiting certificate holders. Fifth, the rulemaking has been posted and discussed at two Board meetings, thereby allowing notice and opportunity for comments from the public and licensees.BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICINE Docket No. 46-0101-1201 Rules of the State of Idaho Board of Veterinary Medicine Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 206 September 5, 2012 - Vol. 12-9Finally, because the agency is very small (employing only two full-time employees) and has an extremely tight budget, any minimal benefit that might result from holding meetings on the rulemaking for further comment from potentially affected persons does not justify the additional expense and burden placed on the Board, its staff and financial resources.

This negotiated rulemaking action is authorized pursuant to Section 67-7408(1)(e), Idaho Code. METHOD OF PARTICIPATION: Persons wishing to participate in the negotiated rulemaking must do the following: Interested members of the public who wish to participate must submit any written comments, questions, recommendations, or ideas to Jeffrey R. Anderson, Execu tive Director, Idaho State Lottery, 1199 Shoreline Lane, Suite 100, P. O. Box 6537, Boise, Idaho 83707-6537, or via e-mail at janderson@lottery.idaho.gov . Responses must be received by September 17, 2012. Should a reasonable number of persons respond to this notice, negotiated meetings will be scheduled and all scheduled meetings shall be posted and made accessible on the agency website at the address listed below. Upon conclusion of the negotiated rulemaking, any unreso lved issues, all key issues considered, and conclusions reached during the negotiated rulemaking will be addressed in a written summary and made available on the agency website. Failure of interested persons to respond to this notice of intent or the lack of a sufficient number of responses to this notice of intent may result in the discontinuation of fu rther informal proceedings. In either event th e agency shall have sole discretion in determining the feasibility of scheduling and conducting informal negotiated rulemaking and may proceed directly to formal rule making if proceeding with negotiated rulemaking is deemed infeasible. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a statement in nontechnical language of the substance and purpose of the intended negotiated rulemaking and the principle issues involved: The Lottery offers many different play styles, from draw and Scratch games to PullTabs. This rule allows the Lottery to include a terminal produced Scratch style game in our current portfolio, which will appeal to social environment retailers and other non-traditional locations. The games are designed to be played on the Lottery's new player operated vending machine, the MP, which currently se lls only draw tickets. The purpose of the machine is to reduce lines and speed transactions in high volume retail locations and improve the purchasing experience for customers and retailers. The change requested allows for a terminal game, which is structured like a Scratch game, with a finite number of tickets, pools and assigned pack and ticket numbers, but delivers the play via a multi-purpose vending machine, or MP.

PRELIMINARY DRAFT: DEQ did not draft a preliminary draft rule for public review prior to the first meeting. The first meeting has been scheduled for the purpose of presenting literature review findings, discussing criteria updates, gathering information, and setting a path forward. The website for this rule docket is located at www.deq.idaho.gov/58-0102-1201 . PRELIMINARY DRAFT: On May 10, 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) disapproved the July 7, 2006 Idaho DEQ water quality standard rule submittal. The disapproval affects 167 of Idaho's revised human health criteria for 88 toxic pollutants. DEQ's proposed rule changed the fish consumption basis for determining the toxic standard from 6.5 g/day to 17.5 g/day (which was EPA's nationally recommended fish consumption rate). EPA disapproved the proposed criteria because EPA believes that the derivation of the criteria does not protect Idaho's designated uses. EPA was unable to ensure that the 17.5 g/day fish consumption rate was consistent with 40 CFR 131.11(a). EPA identified severa l sources of information on local and regional fish consumption, which they claim that Idaho did not consider before using the national default fish consumption rate. According to EPA, the information that EPA reviewed suggests that fish consumption among some Idaho population groups is greater than 17.5 g/day. This rulemaking will evaluate local and regional fish consumption information to determine whether Idaho's statewide criteria are protective of designated uses and, if the current criteria are not protective, to determine appropriate new criteria. The rulemaking will derive the hu man health criteria for acrolein and phenol using updated reference dose values. This rulemaking will also set a human health criterion for copper based on drinking water standards.Thursday, October 4, 2012, 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Mountain Time Department of Environmental Quality Conference Rooms A & B 1410 N.
