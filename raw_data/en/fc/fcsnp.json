After all these years, it continues to amaze me that moving my hands around someone could possibly make a difference to their health and well-being. But there it is. It has been proved to me time and again. The chapters that follow are peppered with patient responses and, despite there being so many, they represent only a fraction of the number of people I have seen. Every other healer will have similar stories to tell and there are many thousands of healers in the UK and around the world, quietly going about their healing work. If your mind is already teeming with questions about healing, then skip to page 217 for a moment, where you will find all the basics. Any other query is bound to be addressed between here and the back cover. In a tiny nutshell, though, healing is about attuning ourselves to Earth energies and cosmic forces and allowing that unlimited, positive energy to flow through us into the patient. This may sound a preposterous notion, but it seems more than feasible when you examine all of the evidence with an open mind. We might actually be doing this. I do not know. While channelling this energy, and working through the taught sequence of hand positions, we maintain a prayer-like peacefulness that trusts that the work we do will be done for the highest good of all concerned. There is nothing out of the ordinary about me. If I can learn to give healing then anyone can, if they are sincere and determined. Being more at home with logic and order, I found the world of healing strange but exciting; it opened up a new vista of learning and experiences, leading me to a fresh and wholesome perspective. Discovering healing and developing the skill has been a voyage of awe and wonder that is available to anyone who is prepared to embark. Every healer I have known talks about sensing energies and seeing colours. They are often surprised to learn that I hardly ever experienced anything extrasensory until after many years of giving healing. Healing has nothing to do with being psychic or being a medium. Though I am not interested in developing either of these skills, I do believe that they are valuable gifts when used wisely. But, even if I were a psychic or a medium, the training I received directed against utilizing these senses while giving healing. Our remit is purely and simply to deliver healing. Consequently, when patients eagerly ask if I have picked up any information about them, I invariably have to disappoint. Even if a healer were psychic in any way, it would be against the rules of a reputable healing organization for a healer to glean information about a person without their knowledge. It would be like going through someone's handbag without their permission. People tend to assume that healers must be particularly kindly and goody-two-shoes types, but this is not necessarily so. However, thanks to the principles that underpin healer training, students become aware of the importance of continually working on themselves, dissolving fears and limitations, forgiving others and transforming the negative thoughts and emotions that lead to stress and worry. Anyone who has taken this challenge to heart will know that it is truly testing and soul-searching stuff. I had a tremendous amount of work to do on myself and I have achieved a great deal, but it remains a lifelong work in progress. Even now, I can be enraged by the diabolical things that people do, and irritated by irksome things that people say. I often quip that I would be a perfect person if nobody upset me! But even that would not be true, of course. Ask anyone I know and they will confirm that I irk as much as anybody else. But rather than dwell upon where people have room for improvement, the point is that character flaws must be no barrier to us becoming effective healers. If we waited until we were perfect or good enough, nobody would ever learn to give healing. If there were anything unusual to mention about me, it would be that I was determined to become a healer despite having no sign of a natural ability. So what made me leap into something for which I had no apparent talent? It was the outcome of my quest to combat psoriasis, a flaky skin condition that was affecting my scalp, causing itching and embarrassment. This had been a constant and tiresome companion since my teens. There is no cure for psoriasis, and steroid cream is the only medical method of gaining temporary relief. Not willing to use steroids, I looked to complementary remedies but achieved no success. Psychology books pointed to deep emotional issues, and I attempted various methods of digging up the offending roots. I felt certain that I was on the right track and made some progress, but it was not enough. To digress for a moment, hypnosis brought only a small improvement for the psoriasis, but a major breakthrough for smoking. Exactly as the hypnotist said, I have not wanted a puff of a cigarette since that one session. If a hypnotist tells you that you need a course of sessions, find someone else. During those explorations, I was surprised to be advised by a spiritual healer that I should take up healer training. The act of giving healing, she said, would balance the energies within me that were causing the psoriasis. She recommended the National Federation of Spiritual Healers (NFSH), later to become known as the Healing Trust. I had not heard of the organization before but I felt inspired to follow it up. For me to resolve to be a healer was like someone who had never seen a cooker deciding to be a chef; plus I expected healing to be in my spare time and entirely unpaid. Also, cooking is within everyone's experience and easily justifiable, whereas healing would be awkward to explain to curious family and friends. Despite the negatives, I felt a thrill at the prospect of training to heal, and I immediately signed up. I had no sensitivity to the energies that were being talked about on the course, so I found that training to be a healer was like being led down a pitch-black alley without being able to touch the sides. Everyone else seemed to revel in the various sensations that confirmed the validity of what we were being taught. Conversely, I was impervious to such phenomena and just blindly followed instructions. I simply placed my hands in this place or that, precisely as shown, and trusted the process. My lack of sensitivity seemed to make no difference to the actual effects. Patients gave me as much positive feedback as they did the others. It became evident to me that one could become an effective healer with no natural talent and without needing to sense the energies involved. I supposed that the key to effectiveness must be the amount of passion behind the intent to heal, as I certainly had an abundance of that. My lack of sensitivity to energies could be due to my being what is termed predominantly left-brained. When the left hemisphere of the brain is dominant, the person is said to be analytical, objective and logical, which I can identify with. Right-brained people, on the other hand, are said to be intuitive, thoughtful and subjective. Neuroscientist Dr Jill Bolte Taylor graphically describes her personal experience of being dominated alternately by the right or the left hemisphere of the brain. As a brain scientist, she was fascinated to witness this while suffering a devastating stroke. Her captivating TED Talk is available to view online. The softer qualities of right-brained people certainly seem abundant among the countless healers I know. But, again, my being out of step with most other healers made no difference to the positive outcomes for patients. Incidentally, a few physical phenomena did eventually develop - I describe those later - but it is still a pleasant surprise if I experience anything extrasensory. Training with the Healing Trust means learning to heal without touching the patient, except for the shoulders and feet. However, we can elect to work with touch, in which case the only additional contact points are the joints of the arms and legs. The patient either sits on a chair or lies on a couch, fully clothed, while the healer encourages them to relax. The session begins with a light touch on the shoulders and then, with hands away from the body, we work downwards, starting around the head and along the trunk of the body. We then work in line with the skeleton, firstly along the spine, then down the arms and legs, finishing with a light touch on the shoulders. The whole process takes about 20 minutes. For new patients, we explain that they may feel heat, cold, tingling or involuntary muscle jumps, or they might see colours. If they did not know of these possibilities in advance, they might feel alarmed at experiencing something out of the ordinary. Or they might see or feel nothing at all. Everything is normal. During my training years, a consistent flow of positive feedback from patients compelled me to believe that the training was effective and that healing works. It was astonishing and exciting to find that, simply by my following the method taught, patients reported feeling better. Occasionally, people told me that they had felt physical movements happening deep within the afflicted part of the body, and that it now felt better. More often, people said that their pain had simply disappeared. Others reported that they had experienced a discomfort or an emotion rise up during the session that had then quickly melted away. Tense patients would leave relaxed and those who came in downcast would be uplifted. I practised my fledgling skills on willing friends and relatives. A colleague at work had been plagued with gout for weeks, and it was getting steadily worse. Walking was excruciatingly painful, but he continued to work full-time. His miserable expression showed that he was unable to find any relief for the agony and that it was getting him down. Although a total sceptic about healing, he was now desperate and prepared to try anything. One Friday lunchtime I gave him a healing session in the office - not the ideal setting in which to unwind, but we had no choice. He was impressed to find that, despite having so much on his mind, he was able to relax deeply. The experience lifted his mood, but the gout remained as painful as ever. I suggested that we try weekly sessions and he agreed. But on the Monday morning he strode into work all smiles. With amazement all over his face, he described getting out of bed on the Saturday morning and reaching the bedroom door before realizing that his foot was back to normal. And it remained so. Another surprising healing success concerned my young son. When flying, he invariably had difficulty getting his ears to pop to counteract the changing air pressure. To minimize the pain, we would travel with menthol crystals so that he could sniff the vapour to open his ear canals. Landing was the worst part of the flight, and the prospect of what was to come would spoil any journey for him. During one especially painful descent, I suddenly thought to try healing. There was no time to do the usual whole body circuit, so I simply cupped his ears. The pain disappeared within a minute and, for the first time, he was able to happily watch what was happening outside. He has never had the problem again. In my very early training days of discovery and wonder, I would eagerly ask each patient what they had felt or experienced during the session and then listen with incredulity to their account. However, I was soon gently corrected and advised that, as a healer, our only remit is to deliver healing. The extent of enquiry afterwards should be limited to How did that feel?, giving the patient the opportunity to share their experience without feeling pressured. The range of regular and positive feedback convinced me beyond doubt that healing was making a wonderful difference to people's lives. Further, if I could become an effective healer without the slightest prior ability, and without being able to sense energies, then surely anyone could. Some healing organizations teach that the ability to heal is a natural part of being human - that everyone is a healer, whether they believe it or not. I must have had the capacity all along; it just needed sparking. After seeing and experiencing how easily people can be helped by healing, I was passionate about letting the world know that it existed. Surely everyone would want to have a slice of this extraordinary pie? But, no. Scepticism stops most people from giving it a chance, and there are many other reasons, too, explained later. A few people decline healing because they think it is against their religion, which I find perplexing. Healing was illegal in the UK until the early 1950s because, historically, the Christian religion had stamped out and demonized any spiritual practices that bypassed its clergy, which included healing. British law continues to reflect wholesome Christian principles but, partly due to the progress of science, the Church's power has diminished in recent decades, leading to the spiritual liberty that we enjoy today. Healing was a fundamental part of early Christianity, and remained so for hundreds of years. But when it became an organized religion, many beliefs and practices were modified or rejected. Paradoxically, the resultant Church eschewed healing, even though the most famous healer of all time has to be Jesus. A number of world religions recognize Jesus as an exceptional prophet, which means his teachings must be accepted by all those believers. Any great leader leads by example and, according to scripture, healing was a major aspect of Jesus' ministry. In addition to his 12 disciples, the Bible says that Jesus empowered 70 others to give healing (Luke 10) and sent them in pairs to at least 41 different destinations. They were to speak with and heal people of all races and creeds. For their work to continue, they must have been empowered to pass this gift on to others, otherwise their mission would have disintegrated when they died. To send healers to 41 destinations in an area that would have been swarming with traders of all nationalities and faiths, Jesus' intention must surely have been to spread healing across the world, and for it to cascade down through the generations to the present day. Indeed, many cultures throughout history are known to have handed down healing knowledge since ancient times.\u00b9 Healing can therefore be celebrated as a common link between religions and nations, as well as a spiritual connection between individuals who have a religious faith and those who do not. Healers, and people who come for healing, can be from any religion or none. I know healers who are Catholics or other Christian denominations, Jews, Pagans, Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists - and there are bound to be other religious sects represented within the world's healing fraternity. Even if healers do not belong to a particular faith, they generally do believe in a higher power. But their patients do not need to believe in anything at all. I have seen confirmed sceptics benefit from healing, despite their stonewall attitude. Once again, this highlights the inclusiveness of healing, in that it provides a universal connection between all people regardless of what they believe. For his television series The Enemies of Reason, the well-known debunker and atheist Professor Richard Dawkins interviewed Nicholas Humphrey, Professor of Psychology at the London School of Economics. Humphrey - also an atheist - stated that, even when using traditional medicine, most of the cure is usually from within the patient's own body. He went on to say that, for some patients, alternative medicine can be more effective than traditional treatment and that, therefore, people should not be dissuaded from seeing a healer. The uncut footage reveals further insights, and can be viewed on YouTube. Both the individual giving healing and the one receiving it often experience a glimmer of what some religions refer to as heaven or nirvana. This state of bliss is possible for anyone, religious or not, and brings about biological homeostasis, the body's natural state of balance and self-repair.\u00b2 Sometimes, stressed people with no religious faith and with no belief in healing have been astounded to experience a profound sense of elation during their first healing session and have left feeling relaxed, buoyant and invigorated. More normally, people gain confidence with each successive healing session and notice gradual improvements over a series of appointments. Healer training with a reputable organization is spread over a couple of years to ensure that enough supervision and experience is gained before qualifying. Basic training with the Healing Trust is available to almost anyone, and this initial course provides enough information and practice for attendees to give healing to willing friends. To go any further, membership of the Healing Trust is necessary, and this calls for character references, and also for qualified healers to provide mentorship during the remaining training period. At the end of the programme, patient testimonials and mentor references form part of the final panel assessment. At the end of my two years, on the way home from qualifying, the idea struck me to apply for a National Lottery grant to set up a voluntary healing centre near my home. Voluntary healing centres are dotted all around the country, but they need to be local enough for people to access them easily. The more the better, I thought, and set about the paperwork. There had never before been a healing centre start-up funded by a grant, so it was a wonderful surprise to open the award letter. The first healer who agreed to team up knew of an ideal venue for us to use. To avoid the cost of advertising, the town mayor agreed to meet with us and pose for a newspaper article. Our story in the local paper made an impact; it brought 27 patients on our first day, plus a continuing trickle thereafter. Our team of eight dedicated healers welcomed patients month after month. Volunteers do not grow on trees, and they have a host of other things that they could be doing with their precious time, but these people made our Monday-morning sessions their priority, some travelling quite a distance. Together, we created a friendly and fun atmosphere that our visitors enjoyed being a part of. One new patient stopped mid-stride as he came through the doors, and declared that he could feel the vibes already. Subsequent grant awards allowed us to produce promotional leaflets, buy exhibition equipment, set up a website, produce an informative DVD, and create a self-help CD called Sleep Easy & Be Well. A hospital in Ohio uses a CD similar to ours, with great success. Cleveland Clinic is consistently ranked as one of the best hospitals in the USA, with patients flying in from all around the world. Some years ago, the clinic implemented a seven-year experiment to see if patients benefited from listening to a guided meditation before, during and after surgery. After just two years, the evidence was so convincing that they halted the trial and put the CD into regular service. Their findings agreed with more than 200 previous studies that guided imagery can help people in the following ways:\u00b3 Significant reduction of stress and anxiety before and after surgical and medical procedures. Dramatic decrease in pain and less need for pain medication. Reduction of side effects and complications resulting from medical procedures. Faster recovery and shorter hospital stays. Enhanced sleep. Strengthening of the immune system and enhanced ability to heal. Increase in self-confidence and self-control. Research shows that patients have been helped by guided imagery when undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, dialysis, in vitro fertilization and various other medical procedures. Given the strength of the evidence over so many years, it would seem obvious to implement this low-cost and effective service throughout any health service. It would be a relatively simple matter to set up and, once installed, the reduced need for medication and ongoing care would more than compensate the investment. More importantly, patients would benefit from a more positive hospital experience. Many of the beneficial effects listed above have been reported by patients who have used our CD and also by patients who have received in-person healing sessions. Visitors to our healing group wrote these notes in our comments book: Better than fantastic! Wild horses will not keep me away. I felt totally rejuvenated, as if I'd slept for a week. I am certainly feeling much better after only a few weeks. I can't wait to see what the future holds. This has helped me to cope with difficult news. Wonderful healing. I always feel low until I get here. After a healing session I feel on top of the world. Healing has made me think and feel positively again. I feel relaxed, happy and ready to start taking control of my life again. Noticeable differences on a wide range of levels. Total peace. What a gift. I have felt much better since last week's session. My shoulder has improved and also my eczema. I feel very positive and relaxed and hope that I continue to feel better each week. A great experience that is relaxing and energizing. Next day I feel really great. This is the best experience I ever had. Wonderful healing. Very relaxing. My mum came recently with a nasty strain, which is completely resolved now due to healing. She is very happy! What a lovely healing. Relaxing and peaceful. Regular healing has helped me to move on with treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and this has become less of a problem for me over the last 12 months. I feel that healing has played a large part in this improvement. I am now 80/20 in control of my life instead of 20/80 before. What a lovely gift, received with thanks. The doctor said no hope for my painful neck and shoulder and warned that it would get worse. After four healing sessions it has completely healed. One of the first patients to arrive at our doors was Chris, who had been off work for three years. He had been unable to take up a new teaching post because of a sudden illness that was followed by a succession of maladies. After a total of 12 healing sessions, this is what he had to say about it: \"When bad health prevented me from taking up a new job, I felt frustrated. A series of illnesses followed, each one seemingly unconnected with the last. It was difficult for my doctor to diagnose as the symptoms kept changing. \"I knew something was wrong but felt that conventional medicine was not an effective response. It was around this time that I saw an advertisement in the local press for spiritual healing. I rang the number and spoke to Sandy, who arranged my first appointment. \"I was unsure as to what to expect. I like to think I have an open mind, but I was concerned that it had something to do with the Spiritualist Church and clairvoyance. I needn't have worried; my first session was very upbeat and uncomplicated. The healers were all very friendly and I found the experience pleasant while not actually being aware of any unusual sensations. \"Sandy explained that one-off recoveries are rare and that the healing process was generally cumulative. It wasn't until three or four sessions later that I could actually feel the healing process taking place. \"After treatment I always felt lighter and more relaxed, tired later in the day and occasionally emotional. I came to realize that healing is not always comfortable; after all, a high temperature is simply a sign of the body healing itself. \"At times, I was aware of specific improvements, while at others I wondered if I was expecting too much. Like watching your hair to see how quickly it is growing, I was only aware of what a difference the healing had made when I looked back after six months of treatment [i.e., 12 sessions] and realized that I was, in many ways, a different person. I was physically and mentally stronger, recurrent aches and pains had disappeared, I was sleeping better and, most importantly, feeling optimistic about the future. \"I look upon the healing I have received as a readjustment. I now realize that I was "}
