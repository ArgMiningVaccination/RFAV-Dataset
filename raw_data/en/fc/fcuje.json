Prince /C211Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010 Abstract This paper surveys the eld of Judaism and health. The authors trace the history of discourse on health and healing within Judaism, from the biblical and rabbinic eras to contemporary research and writing on Jewish bioethics, pastoral care, communal services, and aging, including congregational and community programming related to health and illness and the emergence of the Jewish healing movement. The work of the Kalsman Institute on Judaism and Health is described, focusing on efforts to unite these various threads into a scholarly eld emphasizing basic and applied research on the instrumental functions of Jewish religious life for health and well-being. Keywords Religion /C1Spirituality /C1Health /C1Healing /C1Judaism In 1997, one of the present authors was in Cincinnati to speak at a conference. As a practicing Reform Jew, he thought it would be rewarding to pay a visit to the main campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR), the Reform movement's rabbinic seminary and graduate educational institution. A uniquely Jewish version of a hajj, one might say. While taking in the campus, he came upon a flyer for a noon seminar on an unusual topic for a Reform institution: Jewish congregations as centers for holistic healing. Unfortunately, the talk had just ended, so he was unable to attend or meet the speaker. Still, the idea of a lecture on healing within a rabbinic seminary seemed shocking. The subject of healing has greater currency, presumably, within Christian denominations than within Judaism. Sacramental healing within Roman Catholicism and high-church Protes- tantism, Wednesday night prayer at Pentecostal and charismatic churches, healing rites among members of Unity or Religious Science congregations\u2014these are where one is most likely to encounter talk of healing in a congregational setting. Longstanding traditions exist for such services in Christian churches, accompanied by theological and pastoral writing J. Levin (&) Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA e-mail: jeff_levin@baylor.edu M. F. Prince Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Los Angeles, CA, USA 123J Relig Health DOI 10.1007/s10943-010-9359-2(see Kelsey 1995 ; Weatherhead 1951 ). But a scholarly talk within the seminary of the Reform movement? This seemed too remarkable to believe. An article in the Jewish magazine, Moment , published the same year as the talk at HUC-JIR, perfectly captured this seeming dissonance: Heard for the rst time, the term Jewish healing can conjure up images of crutches being thrown to the floor as the lame walk, or a laying on of hands that shrinks atumor. Actually, Jewish healing is about the quest to become spiritually whole, even if the physical body is broken. A cure may not always be possible\u2014but people can learn to cope with their physical or emotional pain so they can achieve spiritualpeace of mind (Grossman 1997 , p. 62). In the years since, it is apparent that the lecture at HUC-JIR was not an outlier. The past decade has seen widespread and rapid growth of interest in these issues among Jews andwithin Judaism. The present authors can attest to this through experiences in congregationsand through professional and academic activities. Interest in healing\u2014intellectually andpersonally\u2014is found throughout the continuum of Jewish religious observance and acrossthe branches of Judaism. This excitement and intrigue mirrors a growing interest in con-nections between religion and faith, on the one hand, and medicine, health, and healing, onthe other, in the biomedical, social, and behavioral sciences. The research eld emerging at the intersection of religion and health is familiar, of course, to readers of this journal. Studies identifying features of religious identity andpractice as putative protective factors against physical and psychiatric morbidity have beenconducted for decades; the breadth of ndings were rst comprehensively reviewed in thisjournal over 20 years ago (Levin and Schiller 1987 ). The idea of this work as a eld qua eld is more recent, owed in large part to efforts by the late Dr. David B. Larson (see Levinand Koenig 2005b ). With the establishment in 2008 of the Society for Spirituality, Theology, and Health (SSTH), researchers have a sense of professional identity andcommunity. The SSTH is a culmination of efforts begun half a century ago with theestablishment of this journal. While unapologetically interdisciplinary and multidisci-plinary, and admittedly still seen as marginal in some quarters of biomedicine, religion and health can now be thought of as a scholarly eld (see Levin 2009a ). An overview of existing studies reveals very little systematic research in this area ever conducted among Jews. The few ndings include genetic and molecular-biological studies,as well as essays and reviews related to history and ethics and papers on subjects likepatient attitudes, mental health services, and health policy. There are few scholarly worksfocused on the health impact or relatedness of the Jewish religion. Of the thousands of published studies of religion and health conducted in the past several decades, some have included a proportion of Jewish subjects or have comparedmorbidity or mortality rates between Jews and afliates of other religions. For instance, agroup of early-twentieth-century studies compared rates of cervical and uterine cancerbetween Jewish and non-Jewish women; another group of mid-century studies identied a signicant Jewish risk of colitis and enteritis (see Levin and Schiller 1987 ). But not much besides several one-off studies among Israelis has focused on the impact of patterns ofJewish observance on markers of physical or mental health or illness (e.g., Anson et al.1990 ,1991 ; Kark et al. 1996 ; Shmotkin 1990 ; Shmueli 2007 ; Vilchinsky and Kravetz 2005 ; Yeung and Greenwald 1992 ). One might conclude that the interface of Judaism and health is a topic rarely considered by researchers. Expanding one's sights beyond research on health, such as studies by epidemiologists and social scientists, noted earlier, the picture looks different. There is a growing body ofJ Relig Health 123research into the impact of religiousness among Orthodox Jews on indicators of psycho- logical status and psychosocial functioning. These studies are archived at a website calledJPSYCH, a resource serving psychologists of religion interested in traditional Judaism. Inthe arena of applied and evaluative research and health-related programming, quite a bit isgoing on as well (see Prince and Silverman 2008 ). Faith-based initiatives in congregational programming and education, psychosocial and health services provided by Jewish com-munity agencies, chaplaincy and rabbinic efforts in pastoral care, the work of Jewishbioethicists, scholarly discourse on biblical and talmudic teachings about medicine, con- gregational and liturgical innovation in the area of healing\u2014these efforts speak to ongoing pragmatic interests in themes at the intersection of Judaism and health, some of longstanding. These efforts speak to a growing desire to explore what Judaism has to say andoffer regarding health and well-being. Expanding one's sights further yet, beyond research studies, basic or applied, to scholarly writing in theology, rabbinics, and Jewish history, the picture looks different still.In short, a lot of work has been done. Jewish scholarship on health, healing, and health-care\u2014religious and secular\u2014has been ongoing for longer even than Christian scholarlywriting (see Levin and Koenig 2005a ). Jewish religious and academic leaders have begun speaking of Judaism, health, and healing as an acknowledged subject, even as a potentialscholarly eld. A key marker of how quickly things have evolved is the establishment of the Kalsman Institute on Judaism and Health (KIJH) at the Los Angeles campus of HUC-JIR. Theexistence of KIJH suggests that efforts to further scholarship on the intersection ofJudaism, health, and healing have begun to coalesce. As efforts progress, the rst sys-tematic steps have been taken to set an agenda for a new scholarly eld. This paperdescribes these efforts, outlining the history and scope of Judaism and health discussions,the dynamics and ongoing activities of the contemporary Jewish healing movement, theefforts of KIJH at building an academic eld, and new directions in scholarship for thiseld as identied by leading Jewish researchers. Historical Perspectives Implicit in Judaism is a vision of well-being grounded in ''engagement with life; the importance of community, and a belief that sacred texts and rituals can be relevant tomodern dilemmas'' (National Center for Jewish Healing 2009 ). Judaism recognizes the connection between care of the soul and care of the body. Jewish discourse on health andhealing draws on deeply rooted wisdom that has evolved for over 3,500 years with much tosay about illness and wellness and their interconnections with body, mind, and spirit. The denitions of Judaism encompass religion, culture, and national identity, communal and individual. Re-emerging interest in health and healing, coupled with the proliferation of religion and health research, presents an opportunity for programmatic scholarship. Research has afrmed that communal religious participation and private spiritual devotionare salutary influences on the health of people and populations regardless of one's faithtradition (see Levin 2001 ). There is thus good reason to believe that what is true in this regard for religion, generally, is true for Judaism. According to Prince ( 2009 , p. 281), ''Jewish discourse on health and healing is part of a longstanding tradition of religious and scholarly writing on the intersection of the spiritualand physical realms'' dating to before the rabbinic era (see Berger 1995 ; Heynick 2002 ). This cannot be traced through one historical trajectory; it contains distinct threads. TheseJ Relig Health 123include biblical, rabbinic, and contemporary writing on an array of topics (see Freeman and Abrams 1999 ). The Jewish canon, for example, has much to say about anatomy and physiology (Finkel 1995 ) and about the etiology and determinants of illness and health (Preuss 1993 ). The Torah, Talmud, and Midrash contain prescriptions and proscriptions regarding longevity, disease risk, mental health and well-being, disease prevention, andhealing (Levin 2009b ). It has been suggested that this collected wisdom constitutes a uniquely ''Hebraic medicine'' (Epstein 1987 ), akin to traditional Chinese medicine, the Islamic Unani system, and the Hindu A \u00afyurveda. The rabbinic sages engaged medical themes, notably Maimonides who wrote on both philosophical theology and medicine and on their intersection (see Rosner and Kottek1993 ). Some of the medieval Torah commentators were physicians\u2014e.g., Sforno and the Ramban\u2014while notable medical gures of the present day, who write from religious (e.g.,Twerski 1997 ) or secular (e.g., Nuland 2005 ) perspectives, are renowned for superior Jewish learning. Jewish writing on theology and medicine is a small but vibrant area ofscholarship, mostly related to bioethics. It continues an ongoing discussion that dates to theTalmud (Rosner 1995 ). Contemporary Jewish writing on health and healing emphasizes several themes. This includes works by prominent rabbis, scholars, and medical professionals. Some writing ison sacred themes\u2014theology, morality, rabbinics, scripture\u2014offering reflection on secular issues related to health, healing, medicine, or healthcare. Other writing is explicitly health- focused, bringing to bear medical, scientic, or professional expertise on matters of con-cern to Jewish people or communities. According to Prince ( 2009 , p. 281), ''The redis- covered heritage of Judaism, health, and healing is grounded in traditional Judaism, but italso is characterized by a new elascticity, stretched by the search for a personal andprofessional spirituality, demographic shifts, and the feminist movement.'' Contemporarywriting on Judaism and health contains substantial bodies of scholarship focusing on fourissues in particular. First, a considerable literature, of longstanding, examines the relation between medical halakhah (Jewish law) and bioethics. The late Dr. Immanuel Jakovobits ( 1959 ), Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth and preeminent bioethicist, wrote extensively on this subject in relation to Jewish law and practice. Others have followed in a tradition of writing onhalakhic dimensions of healthcare and healing with an eye to informing clinical decision-making (e.g., Bleich 1981 ; Feldman 1986 ; Dorff 1996 ; Zohar 2006 ). The mul- tivolume Medicine and Jewish Law (Rosner 1990 ,1993 ; Rosner and Schulman 2005 ), for example, contains lucid discussions of halakhic perspectives on diverse subjects such as physicians' obligations to disclose and treat, abortion, euthanasia, end-of-life decisions,infertility, genetic engineering, xenotransplantation, accepting gifts from drug companies,and other bioethical challenges. Second, there are ongoing conversations on Jewish pastoral care (Schur 1987 ) and communal health services, especially for the aged (Address and Person 2003 ; Harel et al. 1994 ). The elds of Jewish chaplaincy, communal service, and non-prot management have been institutionalized through graduate and postgraduate training programs. Aca- demic writing on Jewish health-related issues in the pastoral (e.g., Friedman 2001 ) and gerontological (e.g., Dulin 1988 ; Friedman 2008 ) elds has increased as these elds have become established. This includes descriptions of spiritually based clinical approaches forat-risk adult populations experiencing substance abuse, eating disorders, infertility orneonatal loss, or grave illness or those nearing the end of life (Jacob and Zemer 1998 ). Third, Jewish aging is a diverse and rapidly growing area of interest. Contributions include exegetical (Barak and Achiron 1998 ) and epidemiologic (Ben-Ezra and ShmotkinJ Relig Health 1232006 ; Bowling et al. 1992 ; Cohen et al. 1995 ; Litwin 2002 ) analyses, and research and writing in the elds of communal service (Address 2006 ; Friedman 2006 ; Newstein and Frumer 2006 ; Okun 2006 ; Rose 2006 ; Shevitz 2006 ; Siegel 2006 ), social demography (Brodsky 2003 ; Kart 1987 ; Litwin 2004 ; Rosenwaike 1992 ), and theological ethics (Kavka and Rashkover 2004 ). Hiddur: The Center for Aging and Judaism, located at the Recon- structionist Rabbinical College and founded by Rabbi Dayle A. Friedman, is the onlyacademic gerontology center located at a major rabbinic school and is an important locusof education and scholarship. Fourth, a growing literature addresses Jewish approaches to health and wellness, including books on spiritual growth, mindfulness, and meditation (e.g., Kaplan 1978 ,1982 , 1985 ). This includes academic scholarship on healing (e.g., Sered 2002 ,2005 ) and theo- logical and practical guidance from rabbis on meditation as a means to attain spiritualinsight and to deepen one's devotional life (e.g., Cooper 1995 ). Explorations of kabbalistic perspectives on psychology (e.g., Hoffman 1995 ) and healing (e.g., Gelberman 2000 ; Littlewood and Dein 1995 ) include scholarly writing aimed at Jewish lay audiences, some of it emphasizing themes drawn from Jewish mysticism (e.g., Hoffman 1981 ). The work of Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, founder of the Jewish Renewal movement, is especiallyinfluential (Schachter-Shalomi 1993 ; Wiener and Omer-Man 1993 ). This writing identies largely untapped spiritual resources available to contemporary Jews\u2014potential sources of wholeness and wellness that complement more familiar resources found in the mainstream of Jewish liturgy and congregational life. The Jewish Healing Movement Alongside research on putative links between Judaism and health, writing has appeared on what has come to be known as the Jewish healing movement. This work draws on the othercategories of rabbinic and scholarly writing just identied: biblical and rabbinic per-spectives on illness and health; Jewish scholarship and responsa (rabbinic rulings) on theology and medicine; the relation of halakhah and bioethics; Jewish pastoral care, chaplaincy, and communal service; and kabbalistic perspectives on meditation, psychol-ogy, and healing. What makes this movement unique is a collective intention to translatethese threads of scholarship into liturgical innovation and programming. The contemporary Jewish healing movement emerged in the early 1990s. Initial efforts were spearheaded by professionals and lay leaders who recognized that many Jews nolonger had easy or meaningful access to spiritual and communal supports that sustainedprevious generations through illness and loss. These leaders sought institutional remedies,such as health-related services and resources developed for individuals and congregations,especially those in need, and delivered through communal agencies and organizations,grassroots groups, and synagogues. These initiatives drew on wellsprings of Jewish thinking that spoke to the religious tradition as a resource for comfort and solace (see Cutter 2007 ). These developments came at an opportune time, as Jewish religious leaders had begun to decry that in the healthcare eld, as in society, ''the sacred is being sup-planted by technology'' (Silverman 2007 ). A milestone in the movement was a conference for rabbinic and community leaders held in 1991. Participants were encouraged ''to share experiences and look closely both atwhat Judaism had to say about illness and loss and what Jewish life had to offer those whowere ill or bereaved'' (Prince 2009 , p. 283.) This led to founding of the Bay Area Jewish Healing Center, the New York Jewish Healing Center, and the National Center for JewishJ Relig Health 123Healing. Dozens of Jewish healing centers now exist in North America. Many are located in Jewish Family Service agencies, and several offer training in bikur cholim , the mitzvah (commandment) to visit and provide comfort to the ill. Examples include the Continuum ofVisiting Services program of the Jewish Healing Program of Jewish Family and Children'sServices in Sarasota, Florida (Rosenthal 2008 ), serving those who are alone and experi- encing life challenges in homes, nursing homes, or hospitals; and the Kesher 13 inter-generational program pairing pre- b'nai-mitzvah children with isolated elders, run through Jewish Family Services of Metrowest, in Framingham, Massachusetts (Rosenthal 2008 ). Programs have begun expanding into synagogues. Heavy emphasis is placed on adult and youth education including offerings on a range of health-related topics (e.g., Jewishbioethics, end-of-life care, Jewish meditation) and in various formats (classes, retreats,workshops) (see Prince 2009 ). Many congregations hold healing prayer services or incorporate elements of healing prayer into daily, shabbat , or holiday prayer services. Some ''caring congregations'' also utilize nurses or social workers, as modeled afterchurch-based parish nursing programs. Additional information on many of the mostinnovative programs can be found elsewhere (see Prince 2009 ; Rosenthal 2008 ). The Jewish healing movement is evolving to encompass services and resources for those experiencing loss and illness, and to foster wellness through ghting the alienationand spiritual void furthered by society's increasing technophilia and materialism. It is guided by recognition that, for Jews, ''religious faith is the most profound response to the wonders and trauma of life'' (Karff 2005 , p. ix). Judaism recognizes, inherently, the profound consonance and inseparability of ''healing of soul, healing of body'' (Weintraub1994 ). The movement's efforts are generally supported by the laity and rabbinate, across the branches of Judaism. Certain innovations, however, notably liturgical, have met with somecontroversy. Among the Torah-observant, concern has been raised over the question, ''IsJewish healing kosher ?'' (Ozarowski 1998 ). That is, regarding new healing rituals involving congregational praying: do these activities violate Jewish law or are they con-sistent with stringent interpretations of halakhah and thus kosher (permissible)? This is no small issue for many Jews, especially those located within the Orthodox spectrum where halakhic rulings remain the principal source of guidance for gauging whether an activity is permissible or forbidden. This issue has been resolved afrmatively: healing prayer iskosher if implemented as informal z'aka (unstructured crying out to God) as opposed to formal t'lah (organized prayer services) comprising davvenen (ritual prayer) and requiring a minyan (10-man quorum) and mechitza (separation of the sexes) and other halakhic stringencies (Ozarowski 1998 ). Kalsman Institute on Judaism and Health Where the Jewish healing movement has lagged is in coalescing a foundation of schol- arship to inform and guide its efforts. The seminar at HUC-JIR in 1997 is more theexception than the rule. Recently, there has been some excellent scholarly writing andincreased attention to pastoral education within the rabbinic seminaries, a developmentwhich has helped to build the eld of Jewish chaplaincy. It is within the seminaryframework that efforts to foster research and scholarship will best succeed. KIJH was established at HUC-JIR as a home for training, collaboration, and dialog on health, healing, and healthcare from a Jewish perspective. It is served by a national steeringcommittee and by a network of nearly 2,000 rabbinic, academic, and professional partnersJ Relig Health 123who contribute to the work of the Institute in ve distinct content areas: pastoral care education, spirituality and healing, bioethics, congregational programming related to ill-ness and wellness, and policy responses to the organization, delivery, and nancing ofhealthcare. KIJH was founded in 2000 by Rabbi William Cutter and, with the succession of a new director in 2007, has added a sixth area of focus\u2014or, rather, an emphasis that cuts acrossall of its activities. Through a focus on research, KIJH seeks to establish a scholarly eld atthe intersection of Judaism and health, cobbled together from the existing areas of scholarship identied earlier. Goals are to provide a scholarly foundation for programmatic and educational efforts related to Judaism, health, and healing; to create a community ofcollaborating scholars; and to promote and conduct basic and applied research on themes atthe intersection of Judaism and health. These ambitious goals are consistent with thepremium that Judaism places on the value of torah , or learning. KIJH's agenda is multi- faceted; it aims for a ''big tent'' approach to research and plans to support a wide range ofscholarly activities. To achieve its aims, KIJH has convened a working group of Jewish experts for think- tank-style deliberations to provide direction and leadership. The Kalsman Roundtable onJudaism and Health Research, supported by funding from the John Templeton Foundation,consists of a select group of contributors brought together for ongoing discussion on how to build a scholarly eld and to catalyze research. Members constitute a cohort of leading rabbinic, academic, and communal service gures in American Judaism with scholarlyand/or professional expertise and interest in Judaism, health, and healing. KIJH hopes forthe Roundtable to establish an enduring professional community of scholars and practi-tioners who will produce collaborative research, writing, and evidence-basedprogramming. Among the most important tasks of the Roundtable in the next couple of years is to consider a few broad questions meant to focus deliberations that will dene and build theeld of Judaism, health, and healing. KIJH has identied ve categories of topics: 1.Putative connections between Judaism and health : What aspects of Judaism and Jewish life are most relevant to health and well-being? How does the trend among North American Jews toward secular life impact acceptance of Jewish communalsupport for health needs? Can connections between religion and physical and mentalhealth, studied in general populations (see Koenig, McCullough, and Larson 2001 ; Levin 2001 ), be successfully extrapolated to the Jewish population? If so, how do these connections manifest among Jews? Do spiritual needs of Jews facing physicaland life challenges differ from those of non-Jews? In what ways, if at all, are Jewishconceptions of God, covenant, and responsibilities to others associated with beliefsand practices about health, well-being, and healing? 2.Jewish religious diversity as a factor in the relation between Judaism and health : What health-directed practices are normative for Jews within respective Jewish movements and minhagim (religious traditions)? Is there an association between level of Jewish observance and overall or domain-specic well-being or quality of life? Aredifferent styles or degrees of Jewish observance more conducive to well-being? Arefeatures of Jewish life associated with psychological distress? How do the respectiveJewish movements differ in institutional commitment to fostering positive health-related change for Jewish individuals and communities and for society as a whole,such as through constructive efforts in the health policy arena? Are there disparities inJ Relig Health 123how rabbis, educators, communal service professionals, and chaplains are trained in health-related issues throughout the American seminaries? 3.Potential partners and benefactors for a eld of Judaism and health : Who constitutes the eld of Judaism and health? Who should be involved, and what professions,disciplines, and specialties should be represented in its leadership? What constituen-cies stand to benet from scholarship on Judaism, health, and healing, and how cantheir specic needs inform Roundtable deliberations? Once the Roundtable'spreliminary work is completed, whom should it communicate, work, and partnerwith in the Jewish community in order to fulll its mission? How can the Roundtablebest interface with non-Jewish scholars in the religion and health eld? How can theRoundtable's work contribute to the larger religion and health eld? How will the Roundtable determine whether its long-term mission is being accomplished? 4.Priorities for scholarship focused on Judaism and constructed to compare and contrast Jews to members of other faith traditions : In what ways is a Judaism-health connection similar to connections between religion and health within other faithtraditions? Is there something uniquely Jewish about interconnections of Judaism andhealth? For this eld, how can we identify ''where Judaism differs'' (Silver 1987 ) and where it does not? What is it about Jewish observance and belief that is distinctivelyhealth-related? How can we validate existing religious assessment instruments in orderto ensure their applicability to Jews and at the same time to ensure their cross-religiouscomparability? Is this possible? 5.Issues of meaning at the intersection of Judaism and health : Why should the ontological categories of Jewish spirituality and physical and psychological well-being (individually or communally constructed) be associated? What is it about the formerthat would lead us to expect it to influence the latter; and what is it about the latter thatwould lead us to anticipate antecedents related to the former? Is such a perspectiveconsistent with biblical, rabbinic, or contemporary understandings of the Jewishreligion? If so, what does such a connection imply? What does it really mean? Whatdoes it not mean: i.e., how has the idea of a ''religion-health connection'' (Ellison andLevin 1998 ) been distorted in research on other religions? Why does this matter\u2014for the health of Jews and for the practice of Judaism? A special emphasis of the Roundtable is active collaboration across Jewish movements. About a third of KIJH partners are from branches of Judaism outside the Reform move-ment. In addition, KIJH has collaborated with rabbinic and other educational institutionsacross the Jewish religious spectrum, including the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, American Jewish University, and Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. KIJH is a founding member of the Academic Coalition for Jewish Bioethics (ACJB), a jointventure among all seminaries. Among the cohort working on the present initiative arerabbis and academics afliated with the Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, JewishRenewal, and Modern Orthodox movements. The emphasis on inter-movement collaboration is a Jewish value akin to Christian ecumenism. Within institutional Judaism, this is called ''transdenominationalism.'' This isa signicant issue for Jews seeking to navigate such collaborations, as the demarcationlines among movements map out territory claimed by respective organizations and insti-tutions belonging to each branch of Judaism. For an issue such as social action, forexample, there is the Conservative Jewish Action Center, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation's Tikkun Olam program, and the Orthodox Union's Institute for Public Affairs. For health and wellness, the RoundtableJ Relig Health 123expects to nd the same diversity of movement-based programs. A key task will be a eld- wide assessment of precisely what is going on and where, for purposes of mapping theJudaism, health, and healing terrain. This has never been done and, by itself, is an essentialpart of the eld-building enterprise. KIJH and its partners strongly endorse the value of transdenominationalism. It is req- uisite not just for enabling an accurate picture of the full scope of current Judaism andhealth initiatives, but for the challenging work of eld-building to have the widest impact.This is best realized through formal liaisons with organizations that operate independently from the respective movements in the diaspora and in Israel. In the past, KIJH has col- laborated on projects with Jewish healing centers, boards of rabbis, Jewish CommunityCenters, Jewish Family Service organizations, Jewish Federations, centers for bioethics,educational institutions, and medical centers, including hospitals, homes for the aged, andhospices. There is another reason to endorse this approach. Jews raised, educated, and working within respective Jewish movements are socialized to a particular perspective on whatconstitutes normative Jewish belief and practice and on the ideal instrumentalities ofdimensions of Jewish religion for Jewish life, personally and communally (Cohen andBlitzer 2008 ). Subtle and not so subtle differences govern what the movements teach about what it means to be Jewish, what qualies as religious observance, what matters most in living a Jewish life, what religious sanctions apply to myriad health-directed behaviors and decisions, even something as basic (and contentious) as who is a Jew. For the Roundtableto maximize its effectiveness across the Jewish spectrum, it must draw on the collectivewisdom and traditions of Jews whose lives occupy different places within that spectrum. New Directions in Scholarship To establish a scholarly eld of Judaism and health, the Roundtable's objectives for the next few years include (a) building a research foundation for the Jewish healing movement; (b) promoting research that will validate ancient and contemporary Jewish teachings about illness, wellness, and healing through historical, liturgical, biblical, and rabbinic scholar-ship; (c) proposing formal standards for evaluation of health services, resources, and careprovided by Jewish congregations and organizations; and (d) creating a community ofscholars and practitioners who will systematically research topics at the intersection ofJudaism and health. For Judaism, these goals remain unrealized ideals. Professionals and scholars are pur- suing streams of work related in some way to Judaism, health, and healing, but in isolation,disconnected from others, without a unifying context for their efforts. There are Jewishhealthcare providers; chaplains and pastoral care providers; social workers and communalservice professionals operating in healthcare settings; policymakers and researchers focused on concerns ranging from social demography to public health; rabbis and theo- logians writing on themes related to body, mind, and spirit; even a few Jewish scientistsamong the core group who began the religion and health eld. But each respective pro-fessional community, generally speaking, does not collaborate with or perhaps even knowof the others. The Roundtable aims to remedy this situation and to establish Judaism and health as a reputable subject for basic and applied research. It seeks to bring together experts fromreligious and secular disciplines and professions to make common cause in order to furtherknowledge and improve the status and quality of Jewish personal and communal life.J Relig Health 123Looking to the future, KIJH envisions a thriving eld. What would this look like? For one, there are the usual markers of research success: funded research programs, publica-tions in peer-reviewed journals, symposia at annual conferences, scholarly books, invitedlectures at rabbinic schools and secular universities. These signify touchstones of successfor academic researchers. KIJH is anxious to identify mechanisms to increase interest insubjects related to Judaism, health, and healing across academic disciplines, and to help toengineer a future in which this eld can be self-sustaining. If interest in research can besuccessfully catalyzed, next steps might include developing a Request for Proposals for larger research programs, hosting a curriculum competition for undergraduate or graduate professional programs in Judaic studies, underwriting bibliographies and other scholarlymonographs, and perhaps establishing an academic journal and endowing a chair at one ofthe rabbinic seminaries. The growth of the religion and health eld has been impressive. While most of the emphasis has been on the health impact of Christian religious practice and on health-related programming in Christian churches, Jewish-themed scholarship is starting toappear, a development that would have seemed improbable a few years ago. Besides thevarious elements identied earlier, there have been influential denominational policystatements and position papers (e.g., Union for Reform Judaism 2007 ; USCJ Commission on Social Action and Public Policy 1993 )\u2014a timely contribution in light of current debate on healthcare reform\u2014as well as longstanding discussion of the intersection of Judaism and public health (e.g., Dorff 1988 ; Solomon 2009 ; Vorspan and Lipman 1956 , p. 20). An especially notable contribution would be the development of a Jewish counterpart to the US Health Interview Survey or a North American version of the Israel National HealthSurvey (Kessler 2007 ; Levinson et al. 2007 ). A Jewish population health census, besides its value to public health scientists and policymakers, would enable an evidence-basedapproach to communal programming, public health intervention, clinical outreach, andhealth policy. At present, even as basic a question as, ''How healthy are American Jews?''is not answerable. An answer, coupled with a comprehensive needs assessment of existingresources in the Jewish community, would make a substantial contribution both to thestudy of the Jewish religion, of synagogue life, and of Jewish institutions and to the health and general well-being of k'lal Yisrael (the Jewish community). This work promises a thoughtful and creative engagement of the biblical maxim that the path of torah and its observance is ''life to those who nd them, and healing to all their flesh'' (Proverbs 4:22).
