Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy , the first to enter clinical translation and commercialization, has led to remark- able improvements in patients with aggressive B cell malignancies, producing long-term sustained remis-sions in many cases. However, despite these successes, challenges remain. The complex manufacturing pro- cess of CAR T cell therapy increases costs and length- ens the vein to vein time, thus representing an obstacle for patients who, owing to rapidly progressing disease, are in critical need of treatment. Furthermore, the requirement for the patient's own cells as the source material restricts eligibility, as many patients are often heavily pretreated and lymphopenic , and may not have sufficient cells to yield a viable product. In the clinic, CAR T cell-related cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicities represent an additional concern, requiring inpatient monitoring. Given these limita-tions, there is growing interest in exploring cell sources that are off the shelf and could be applied universally. Because T cells recognize and mediate a response against non-self via the T cell receptor (TCR), use of CAR T cells in the allogeneic setting requires additional genetic editing steps to remove the TCR to mitigate the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Natural killer (NK) cells, on the other hand, recognize their targets in a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-unrestricted manner and thus do not present these same risks, mak-ing them attractive candidates for universal cellular immunotherapy 10. NK cell effector function is con- trolled by a complex array of activating and inhibitory receptors that can distinguish between healthy and 'stressed' cells11. The cumulative cues resulting from receptor-ligand engagements determine whether NK cells deliver a 'kill' or 'not kill' signal. Healthy cells are spared via recognition of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules which bind inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) that signal to stop NK cell function. By contrast, through the mech- anism of missing-self recognition, NK cells attack abnor - mal self-cells, such as tumour cells, which downregulate expression of MHC class I molecules in an attempt to evade T cell responses, and upregulate activating lig- ands that are induced by stress such as DNA damage or malignant transformation 12-16.Autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy A patient-specific cellular therapy in which the patient's own T cells are genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor.

Possessing multiple cytotoxicity mechanisms and the ability to modulate the immune response through cytokine production, NK cells play a pivotal role in anticancer immunity. This role was elucidated nearly two decades ago, when NK cells, used as immunotherapeutic agents, showed safety and efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced-stage leukaemia. In recent years, following the paradigm-shifting successes of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered adoptive T cell therapy and the advancement in technologies that can turn cells into powerful antitumour weapons, the interest in NK cells as a candidate for immunotherapy has grown exponentially. Strategies for the development of NK cell-based therapies focus on enhancing NK cell potency and persistence through co-stimulatory signalling, checkpoint inhibition and cytokine armouring, and aim to redirect NK cell specificity to the tumour through expression of CAR or the use of engager molecules. In the clinic, the first generation of NK cell therapies have delivered promising results, showing encouraging efficacy and remarkable safety, thus driving great enthusiasm for continued innovation. In this Review, we describe the various approaches to augment NK cell cytotoxicity and longevity, evaluate challenges and opportunities, and reflect on how lessons learned from the clinic will guide the design of next-generation NK cell products that will address the unique complexities of each cancer. 1Department of Stem Cell T ransplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of T exas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. 2Department of Medicine III: Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, T echnical Munich, Munich, Germany. e-mail: KRezvani@ mdanderson.org https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41568-022-00491-0 REVIEWS NATuRe RevIewS | CanCer 0123456789();: These various attributes provide NK cells with unique advantages for allogeneic therapeutic applications. With the accelerated development of innovative strategies and the emergence of next-generation technologies that allow for deeper biological investigations, various NK cell products can be designed for cancer treatment. In this Review, we describe how these unique properties of NK cells are leveraged for adoptive NK cell immuno- therapy, and provide an overview of the evolving engi-neering strategies to augment NK cell potency and persistence, as well as the efforts to redirect NK cell specificity to tumours through next-generation CAR molecules, engineered TCR and pre-complexing with cell engagers. Lastly, we conclude with a perspective on the challenges and opportunities ahead as we confront solid tumours and safeguard immune effector cells from the suppressive pressures within the tumour micro-environment, while also devising strategies to monitor and mitigate inadvertent safety concerns. Biological properties of NK cells Despite the successes of engineered T cell immuno- therapies1-8, the clinical benefit has been limited to a fraction of patients and a few indications, thus highlight-ing the need for new strategies. Leveraging innate immu-nity to broaden the scope of antitumour responses is an attractive option. Within the innate immune system, NK cells are specialized immune effector cells, and are sus-pected to have a role in tumour immunosurveillance 10, as suggested by the correlation of low NK cell activity with increased cancer susceptibility and higher risk of metastasis observed in both preclinical and clinical studies 17-19. NK cells develop from CD34+ progenitor cells in the bone marrow, although it is as yet unclear whether they arise from a unique set of precursor cells or from multipotent progenitors that also give rise to T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes and myeloid cells 20. Unlike T cells and NKT cells, NK cells lack expression of the clonotypic TCR and the associated CD3 complex responsible for signal transduction. NK cells are gener - ally classified under a dichotomous distribution based on the relative expression of surface proteins and CD16: CD56 and single-cell proteo-genomics, however, have led to the understanding that NK cells may, in fact, exhibit greater phenotypic heterogeneity that extends beyond these two subsets, giving rise to diverse cell populations endowed with varying functional properties 22. NK cells possess strong cytotoxicity and, upon form- ing immunological synapses with targets, elicit a potent response through the release of cytolytic granules and cytotoxic cytokines 23. Moreover, they can recognize antibody-coated cells through their Fc RIIIA (CD16) production24. NK cells have also been described as 'immune-regulatory' because of their ability to produce an array of cytokines and chemokines, through which they help shape B cell and T cell responses, and impact the function of dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils 11. This broad range of attributes reveals the sophisticated network of bio- logical mechanisms associated with NK cell function and supports the value of NK cells for immunotherapy. Memory-like function in NK cells. Early studies reported memory-like responses by NK cells in mouse models of cytomegalovirus infection25,26, a behaviour not typ- ically associated with innate immune cells. In these studies26,27, mouse NK cells, when stimulated with a combination of IL-12 and IL-18, acquired a functional phenotype characterized by increased production of IFN . Interestingly, after a resting phase, these cells were able to reactivate upon cytokine stimulation or engage- ment of activating receptors and exhibited an enhanced IFN response resembling the memory-like properties of adaptive immune cells. Later, Todd Fehniger's group hypothesized that human NK cells should, likewise, be endowed with memory-like properties. Consistent with this hypothesis, their study demonstrated that human NK cells, preactivated with IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18, fol- lowed by 1-3 weeks rest, were able to generate a robust response driven by enhanced IFN production upon subsequent exposure to cytokines or to K562 leukaemia cells28. Since then, many more groups have described similar memory-like function in various immuno logical settings, including observations of such responses in humans29,30. NK cell source and donor selection In patients with cancer, NK cells typically display a dys-functional phenotype marked by altered gene expres- sion profiles and reduced cytotoxic function 31,32, thus diminishing the feasibility of autologous NK cell ther - apy applications. Moreover, autologous manufacturing platforms are cumbersome and may limit accessibil-ity if patients are not able to provide sufficient cells to undergo downstream processing and engineering. Because allogeneic NK cells do not cause GvHD, cur - rent NK cell therapy programmes rely largely on alloge-neic sources to avoid the incumbrances associated with autologous approaches. There are various sources from which NK cells can be derived (Fig. 1), namely peripheral blood mononuclear cells28-30, cord blood28-30,33-37, immor - cells (HSPCs)33,34,41 and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)42,43. All sources can provide clinically meaningful cell doses, are amenable to CAR receptor engineering and have transitioned into in-human studies. They, nev-ertheless, come with unique advantages and challenges, and may possess different underlying transcriptional, phenotypic and functional properties 44. NK-92, the first NK cell-based immunotherapy to receive Investigational New Drug approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical testing, is a homogeneous, immortalized NK lymphoma cell line that can be expanded ex vivo to achieve large cell numbers 38 (TAble 1). NK-92 cells lack expression of most KIRs and are thus less likely to become inhibited, which makes them attractive for cell therapy use38. However, their cancerous origin raises safety concerns, and irradiation of NK-92-derived cell products prior to patient administration is required, which, in turn, can Allogeneic setting The therapy setting in which adoptive cell therapies are generated from material obtained from a different individual of the same species. Graft-versus-host disease (gvHD).

Killer cell immunoglobulin- like receptors (KiRs).

Another disadvan- tage is that, owing to a lack of CD16 expression, NK-92 cells are devoid of the ability to mediate cell killing via ADCC. NK cells can also be derived from CD34 + progenitor cells upon in vitro differentiation33. In a first-in-human clinical trial, Dolstra et al. showed clinical efficacy in older patients with minimal residual disease-positive acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who received adop-tively transferred HSPC-NK cells 34. Although prelimi- nary results are encouraging, clinical studies exploring the safety and efficacy of HSPC-NK cells in larger patient populations and various indications will help determine the range of potential clinical applications for these cells. Future work will also need to address whether HSPC-NK cells can be effectively engineered to achieve enhanced tumour specificity.iPSCs are an appealing source for NK cells given their clonal growth and high expansion capacity, as well as their ability to differentiate in vitro, allowing for the manufacturing of large numbers of homogeneous NK cell products. A potential disadvantage is that iPSC-derived NK cells often express low levels of endogenous CD16, although this can be mitigated through genetic engineering 45. Another possible concern is that iPSCs may harbour DNA methylation signatures consistent with their somatic tissue of origin46. This 'epigenetic memory' could influence the development of specific cell lineages that differ from the donor cell, and should, therefore, be con- sidered when employing iPSC platforms 47. Nonetheless, a growing number of genetically engineered iPSC-NK cell candidates are emerging in preclinical studies, with a few that have transitioned into clinical trials48-51. In a phase I/II trial, iPSC-NK cells expressing CAR showed encourag- ing results in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Readily available through global cord blood banks High proliferative potential Requires ex vivo expansion (ca. 2 weeks) Inter-donor variability High proliferative potential Homogeneous cell product Mature phenotype Highly functional and cytotoxic Readily available through global cord blood banks Possess NK cell precursors High proliferative capacity Easy to manipulate and engineer Homogeneous cell product Reduced sensitivity to cryopreservation Immature phenotype Requires genetic manipulation for CD16-mediated ADCC Extended in vitro culture condition Requires ex vivo expansion Inter-donor variability Not readily available, need donors Need for irradiation prior to infusion owing to NK cell lymphoma origin Limited in vivo persistence following irradiation Low ADCC due to low or absent CD16 expression Requires extended ex vivo expansion owing to very low CD34 + frequencies (5-6 weeks) Inter-donor variability Low ADCC due to low or absent CD16 expressionCordblood iPSC Peripheral blood Cord blood HSPCNK-92 LimitationsStatus of CAR NK cell programme Clinical ecacy of CAR NK cells Nkarta WugenCatamaran Bio KiadisKey development programme Fig. 1 | advantages and limitations arising from different sources of nK cells.

Cord blood NK cells have a proven track record for CAR-redirected antitumour cytotoxicity and clinical activity, as pioneered by our group35,37. In our study, we demonstrated potent clinical efficacy of gene- tically engineered phase I/II clinical trial37. NK cells derived from all of these sources have been shown to have advantages and disadvantages for adop- tive cell therapy applications. Having various options for source material confers a degree of versatility to the design of therapeutic strategies, allowing platforms to be specifically tailored to address the needs of each patient population and disease indication. It is important to note that inter-donor variabil- ity may influence NK cell profiles and, thus, impact clinical outcomes. Therefore, a thorough understand- ing of product characteristics is critical to define bio-markers indicative of greater potency and persistence. From an immunological perspective, donor-derived NK cells might prove advantageous when administered across HLA-KIR genotypic boundaries as HLA-KIR ligand disparity might help overcome tumour immune evasion. Early into the journey of NK cell-based immunotherapy, the field recognized a dramatically reduced probability of post-transplant AML relapse in recipients of HLA haplotype-mismatched grafts with KIR ligand incompatibility 53. Although KIR-HLA genotype-informed donor selection remains an area of active investigation 54-57, evidence suggests a potential benefit of this approach in the setting of T cell-depleted allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) 58-66. Further work is needed to determine whether this strategy can be successfully adopted into NK cell therapy pipelines. Enhancing NK cell fitness and antitumour function Chimeric antigen receptors. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic fusion proteins comprising an extracellular antigen-recognition domain and intracel- lular signalling moieties that trigger cell activation. Most commonly, the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) from a desired antibody is used for the antigen-binding domain, although many CAR modalities comprising the extracellular portion of native cellular receptors have also been constructed, leveraging the natural spec-ificity of receptor-ligand interactions 67-69. CARs can be expressed on immune effector cells for the purpose of reprogramming their specificity to a particular tar - get (Fig. 2a). CAR-engineered T cell therapeutics were the first to emerge, with various products developed for immuno-oncology applications 1-8. The field has since expanded, and NK cells have also been integrated into gene engineering pipelines 70,71.

Motivated by these encouraging results, there is growing interest in designing CARs based on activat- ing signals associated with NK cell biology (Fig. 3b). Examples of such an approach include DNAX-activation protein 12 (DAP12) and DAP10, which have been used in place of CD3 in some studies72-76. These adapter proteins are intracellular signalling domains that func- tion via recruitment of PI3K and are associated with activating molecules such as NKp44, activating KIRs (KIR2DS ini- tiate a cascade of signals that culminate in the release of cytotoxic granules and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IFN 72. DAP10, although not possess- ing an ITAM domain, has been shown to induce potent killing activity in NK cells via signalling through the NKG2D-DAP10 axis 76. In the past few years, the behaviour of CARs, once anchored on the cell surface, has garnered considerable interest, especially following observations that, in some cases, CAR T cells demonstrated an elevated basal level of activation independent of antigen engagement, referred to as tonic signalling77-81. Although studies continue to explore potential causes of this phenomenon, it has been reported that CARs may incorporate into the TCR-CD3 complex via the CD3 domain and may augment T cell activation82,83.

These observations suggest that CARs are not static on the cell membrane but, rather, are prone to interacting with endogenous receptors. Although not much is yet known regarding these types of receptor associations in NK cells, it is conceivable that CARs may form synergistic partnerships with any of the many acti- vating receptors on the membrane of NK cells, resulting in cooperative activation. Efforts have also focused on refining CAR-based strategies, motivated by learnings from clinical transla- tion of this therapy, which have prompted investigations into approaches to overcome the challenges experienced in the patient. One critical obstacle to CAR-based cell therapy is antigen escape, a process through which tumours, via antigen loss or downregulation, evade the immune response. Various strategies have been employed to address this issue. Targeting multiple anti-gens is a viable approach to both increase the stringency of tumour detection and extend therapeutic benefit (Fig. 3c). This is often accomplished either by expressing a bi-cistronic construct that encodes for two separate CARs (each specific for a different antigen on the tumour and linked to two separate signalling endodomains) or by expressing a single CAR containing bi-specific rec-ognition domains, each targeting a different antigen in tandem and linked to a single signalling endodomain 86. Dual-CAR approaches afford greater design flexibility, accommodating combinations of signalling domains and receptor formats. Each CAR may be formatted to provide both activating and co-stimulatory signals upon target engagement. Alternatively, trans -signalling formats separate these two signals and require engage-ment to both antigens for full activation. With bi-specific CARs, the antigen-binding moieties are linked to a sin-gle receptor, often a second or third-generation CAR 87,88. In either approach, considerations regarding antigen density, membrane localization and protein structure are important to ensure both CARs bind their targets efficiently at the immune synapse. Although most of these innovative CAR-based approaches have focused on T cells, it is plausible to anticipate that these systems can also be applied to NK cells. Strategies for improving the control of CAR-mediated activation have also been explored, especially with a focus on minimizing toxicities resulting from on-target, off-tumour effects. Promoting selective targeting, via the use of logic-gated CARs, has been shown to mitigate some of these problems in the context of CAR T cells 89-93 (Fig. 3d). A recent study presented preliminary findings showing the feasibility of controlling CAR NK activity when applying an 'OR' and 'NOT' logic gated CAR gene circuit approach92,93. In this work, the team targeted FLT3 and/or CD33 on AML blasts via bivalent CARs and employed an inhibitory CAR to bind an antigen on healthy haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and elicit a 'NOT signal' to prevent cell killing 92,93. One key limitation of CAR-based approaches is that, for the most part, detection capability is limited to surface proteins. Intracellular antigens, which are presented in the form of peptide-HLA complexes, are naturally detected via the TCR. Engineering NK cells to express a TCR could allow detection of such peptides (Fig. 2b). TCR-guided NK-92 cells have recently been shown to mediate successful antitumour responses94. Although additional studies are warranted to validate the clinical applicability of this approach, one poten - tial advantage is that, because NK cells do not possess endogenous TCR, mispairing issues that have been reported in TCR-engineered T cells 95 will likely not be a concern. A downside, however, is that NK cells are not equipped with the full signalling machinery found in T cells, thereby potentially compromising the ability to be potently activated via a synthetic TCR. NK cell engagers. NK cells can also be directed to tumour sites via engagers that elicit a strong NK cell-mediated antitumour response by triggering an activating receptor on the NK cell, while simultaneously binding a target antigen on the tumour cell 96-100 (Fig. 2c). Additional NK engager strategies include tri-specific and tetra-specific designs that aim to strengthen the antitumour effect by targeting multiple antigens on the tumour or cross-linking cytokine NK expan - sion 101- 105. The use of cell engagers bypasses the need for engineering and does not require vector- mediated gene transfer, therefore representing a simpler and less costly manufacturing process that can deliver a product capable of inducing CAR-like activity. Various preclinical studies have shown promising results when employing NK cell engagers to target hae-matological and solid malignancies 96-106. Recent work demonstrated a robust NK cell-mediated response against primary patient-derived AML blasts by employ- ing a tri-specific molecule targeting CLEC12A on AML cells and activating NK though a antibody CD16 and NKp46, was shown to drive potent antitumour response, culminating in efficient control of tumour growth in vivo in the setting of solid and metastatic malignancies in preclinical models 106. Recently, our group demonstrated that CB-NK cells, when complexed with AFM13 \u2014 a bi-specific cells and CD30 on leukaemia or lymphoma targets \u2014 exhibited enhanced killing of CD30 + tumour cells, leading to CAR-like responses100. We have since translated this approach to the clinic for treatment of R/R CD30+ Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (NCT04074746 (ReF.107)). As more strategies transition into clinical tri- als, it will be important to also evaluate the durability of the antitumour effect of engager-loaded NK cells and determine whether multiple treatments are required for sustained therapeutic benefit. Cytokine armouring. Whereas CAR and TCR engineer - ing technologies seek to enhance NK cell function by genetically redirecting their specificity, there are also initiatives that aim to effectively prime NK cells ex vivo and/or in vivo to sustain optimal antitumour function and persistence. It is well described that freshly isolated NK cells have lower cytolytic capacity compared with NK cells that have been primed 108. One approach to address Logic gated A term derived from electronics that refers to implementation of a boolean strategy to execute a logical function on one or more input signals to generate a single output signal. NATuRe RevIewS | CanCerReviews 0123456789();: this limitation is cytokine-mediated activation, and vari- ous methods are currently under investigation29,100,109- 114. Ex vivo expansion of NK cells with combinations of IL-2, IL-15 and IL-21 supplementation shows that these cytokines enhance cytotoxic function and support high proliferation rates while maintaining cells in a healthy, non-exhausted state 115. It has now become clear that, when cultured in the presence of IL-12/15/18, PB-NK cells shift to a pheno-type referred memory-like NK cells 29. Cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells have clinical efficacy in patients with R/R relapsed myeloid neoplasias both in the pre-transplant and NK cells to express responses leading to increased potency against NK-resistant malignancies111, 112. Furthermore, in our own clinical trial employing the NK cell engager AFM13, preacti- vation of NK cells with IL-12/15/18 to induce memory programmes led to enhanced responses against CD30+ lymphomas100 (Fig. 2c) (NCT04074746 (ReF.107)). Although these data strongly point to the advantage of cytokine priming, continuous ex vivo stimulation ren-ders NK cells 'cytokine-addicted' and leads to decreased persistence when these cells are infused in the absence of in vivo cytokine support 115. To avoid this problem and still leverage the benefits of cytokine activation, the field has turned to genetic engineering, through which NK cells are modified to produce cytokines that will sup-port cell potency, proliferation and persistence (Fig. 3e). This autocrine support has garnered notable interest, and CAR-engineered NK cells are emerging armed with supplemental cytokine signalling35,37,48,49. Cytokine armouring can be programmed such that soluble cytokines are released into the environment or are engi- neered in membrane-bound form to induce response upon cell to cell interaction 116. In soluble form, cytokines that are produced by engineered NK cells can mediate a bystander effect and, thereby, activate other immune effector cells \u2014 such as T cells or myeloid cells \u2014 that are present in the tumour microenvironment (TME), thus potentially further augmenting the antitumour response 117. Our group, as well as others, has demon- strated that IL-15-armoured CAR NK cells exhibit superior persistence in vivo in preclinical models when compared with CAR alone 35,48,49. These findings were confirmed in a clinical study of patients with CD19+ lymphoid malignancies, in many of whom we detected CAR NK cells in circulation a year after treatment37. With each cytokine armouring approach, it is impor - tant to determine optimal cytokine-dosing strategies that will support increased function and persistence, but will not compromise NK cell functionality by inducing metabolic exhaustion, as has been previously reported 118. Overcoming immunosuppression. The TME consists of a harsh metabolic landscape characterized by a heter - ogeneous mix of immunosuppressive metabolites, glu-cose and amino acid deprivation, hypoxia and acidity, which, in concert, prevent effective antitumour immu- nity. In solid tumours specifically, hypoxia is a common driver of immune cell dysfunction. It has been shown that NK cell function is impaired in the hypoxic TME, in part due to the increased influx of suppressor cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regu - latory T cells (T reg cells) and M2 macrophages in the TME as well as a direct impact of hypoxia on NK cell function 119- 122. Inhibition of hypoxia-responsive HIF1a signalling in NK cells has been reported to enhance NK cell potency and unleash NK cell-mediated an aberrant behav- iour that results in high levels of lactic acid, depletion of vital nutrients and an increase in concentrations of toxic catabolites, adenosine and reactive oxygen species 109. In addition, the uncontrolled proliferation, dysfunctional vasculature and presence of immunosuppressive cell subsets contribute to the dismal fate of immune effec-tor cells that venture into the TME. To overcome the detrimental effects of metabolic immunosuppression, current strategies focus primarily on two areas: altering the metabolic constitution of the tumour or modifying gene expression programmes in immune cells to shield them from the suppressive metabolites in the TME (Fig. 4a). Studies have shown that high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood and the TME cor - relate with poor outcomes for patients with melanoma and low response to checkpoint therapy 124. Although still in the preclinical phase, glycolytic inhibitors and LDH blockers may provide an opportunity to favourably modulate the TME. A recent study showed that treat-ment of patient-derived with a lactate dehydrogenase led to improved T cell antitumour cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo 125. Lactate levels in the TME can also be decreased by targeting its transporters, MCT1 and MCT4, as has been shown for AstraZeneca's AZD3965 compound, currently under investigation in the clinic (NCT01791595 (ReF.126)). Adenosine, a by-product of ATP metabolism, is generated via the activity of ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. Under the hypoxic conditions of the TME, expression of these enzymes is upregulated as part of the hypoxia-driven purinergic signalling pathway, resulting in the accumulation of extracellular adenosine, which in turn acts as a negative regulator of T cell and NK cell function in the TME, suppressing their metabolism and effector function 127- 130. Interestingly, adenosine contrib- utes to activation of suppressor cells such as Treg cells, M2 macrophages and MDSCs, all resident populations within the TME. Therapeutic strategies for overcoming adenosine-mediated immunosuppression include block-ing CD73 on tumour cells via small-molecule inhib-itors or with antagonistic antibodies, both of which are cur rently under clinical investigation (NCT04148937 (ReF.131), NCT03454451 (ReF.132) and NCT03616886 (ReF.133)). Furthermore, in preclinical studies, genetic editing to delete the adenosine A2A receptor in both CAR T cells and CAR NK cells has shown promise for improving the potency and antitumour efficacy of these cells 134- 137 (Fig. 4a). TGF signalling is another mechanism of immuno- suppression within the TME that has a deleterious effect on NK cell function. Knockdown of the TGF-induced www.nature.com/nrcReviews 0123456789();: miR-27a-5p to cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo138. Additionally, NK cells equipped with a high-affinity dominant-negative TGF receptor can resist the effects of TGF and retain their potency139. Similarly, our group successfully rendered CB-NK cells immune to TGF signalling by targeted deletion of the TGF receptor (TGFBR2) 140. We subsequently provided in vivo evidence that disruption of TGF signalling safeguards NK cell cytotoxicity in a mouse model of glioblastoma141. As we seek to modulate immunometabolism in the TME, it is important to achieve a physiologic balance, as some metabolites are an essential component of normal metabolism. Although many strategies are still under development, it is plausible that a combined approach involving TME modulation and NK cell engineering will lead to reduced immunosuppression and will support robust immune cell activity.Checkpoint disruption. Tumours have evolved sophis-ticated mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, including the engagement of immune checkpoints, which may restrain NK cells in a similar manner as has been described for T cells. Striving to translate the clini- cal successes seen with the blockade of T cell-associated immune checkpoints PD1 and CTLA4, several groups have explored the potential of modulating these regu- latory circuits in the context of NK cells 142- 149 (Fig. 4b). Although some studies point to their role as functional suppressors, their overall relevance in NK cell biology is still under debate 146,150. With some likelihood, the signal- ling networks that underpin NK cell activation constitute a more nuanced picture in which these predominantly T cell markers act in concert with various other NK cell regulators 151. Other regulators which have been investigated include TIM3 (ReFS.152,153), T cell immuno- receptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains Targeted ablation of CD38 to prevent fratricide and combination with antibodiesTargeted of glucocorticoid receptor cell Fig. 4 | Genetic engineering strategies to overcome suppressors of nK cell function. a-f | Immune cell function is severely compromised by the hostile tumour microenvironment (TME)134. Current strategies leverage engineering tools to disrupt suppressive signals in the TME (panel a ) and improve immune cell homing into tumour beds by ectopic expression of chemokine receptors (panel d ). A selection of natural killer (NK) cell-relevant pathways that have been targeted through genetic engineering is shown. Genetic engineering strategies that include targeted ablation of inhibitory checkpoints 156, 164, 167, 168 (panels b,c) as well as disruption of extracellular receptors which sense inhibitory stimuli including TGF140, 141 and adenosine135 (panel a ) have been shown preclinically to effectively target pathways to enhance metabolic fitness and persistence of NK cells, and efforts are ongoing to advance these findings into the clinic. Ablation of endogenous receptors allows for combinatorial therapeutic approaches, such as by rendering immune cells resistant to corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression (panel e ), a principle previously established in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-directed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) 281. Knockout of ) renders NK cells resistant to CD38-mediated fratricide, which enables combination strategies of NK cells and anti-CD38-targeting monoclonal antibodies in the context of treating multiple myeloma 50.

Inhibitory KIRs are potent negative regulators of NK cell function and can override any concomitant activating signal when engaged with HLA class I lig - ands. Given their prominent role in suppressing NK cell function, inhibitory KIRs have attracted considerable interest. Lirilumab, an anti-panKIR2D antibody, func - tions to skew the diverse and often opposing signalling cues perceived by NK cells towards net activation by blocking these inhibitory KIRs 158. In two early-phase clinical trials, however, Lirilumab failed to elicit clini- cally meaningful responses159,160. One potential reason for these results might stem from the important role of inhibitory KIRs in NK cell education and licensing . Under this assumption, prolonged KIR inhibition due to continuous KIR blockade by Lirilumab might negatively affect NK cell function 161,162. Similar to KIR molecules, CD94/NK group 2 member A receptor (NKG2A) is another prominent negative NK cell regulator, which, when bound to its restrains NK cell cytotoxicity. led to a prom- ising 31% objective response rate in patients with pre- viously treated recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck when administered in combination with cetuximab 163. Monalizumab is cur - rently being tested against other solid tumours including colorectal cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer as well as post alloHSCT. Common to these approaches is the reliance on mon- oclonal antibodies to modulate the patients' immune cells, a strategy that requires multiple infusions owing to their limited in vivo half-life. With advances in genetic editing capabilities, NK cells can be stably modified to regulate biological mechanisms that augment NK cell effector function. One example is the genetic disruption of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, which led to superior tumour control in xenograft mouse models inoculated with HLA-E + tumours164 (Fig. 4b). Moreover, building on seminal work that established CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein) as a critical negative regulator of NK cell function165,166, we and others successfully engi- neered NK lacking this intracellular cytokine checkpoint. The resulting CAR NK cells exhibited enhanced metabolic fitness and increased antitumour activity (Fig. 4c). These studies foreshadow the potential of targeted genetic perturbations to modulate NK cell biology. Going forward, we anticipate that unbiased high-throughput discovery approaches will elucidate the functional con-sequences of specific genetic interventions in a more systematic manner to, ultimately, inform the design of the next generation of NK cell immunotherapies. Enhancing NK cell trafficking to tumours. The abil- ity of NK cells to traffic to and penetrate tumour beds is a critical prerequisite for effective antitumour immunity and has been linked to improved clinical outcomes 169-173. NK cells, similar to other immune cells, are guided towards tumour sites by the dynamic interplay of chemokine receptors and their cognate ligands secreted in the TME 174- 177. A growing body of work has, in recent years, investigated how modu- lation of these interactions may be harnessed to aug- ment effective homing to the tumour. Whereas earlier studies focused on the expansion-induced upregula - tion of chemokine receptors 178, 179 as well as transient transfection methods180,181, the swift loss of chemokine expression owing to internalization and degradation182 has led to the increasing adoption of genetic engineer - ing strategies to stably equip NK cells with ectopic chemo kine receptors 182,183 (Fig. 4d). Today, the available studies provide encouraging preclinical evidence to support chemokine receptor modulation to enhance NK cell trafficking into tumour beds across a broad range of hard to treat tumours including multiple myeloma 184,185, adenocarcinoma186 and ovarian cancer187. Despite these advances, three important obstacles remain. First, chemotactic gradients rely on adequate tumour perfusion, and microthrombi-induced circula-tion deficits may require strategies to increase tumour micro-perfusion 182. Second, the release of chemokines from the TME follows distinct tumour-specific kinet - ics, and intratumoural chemokine levels may need to be artificially boosted to robustly attract engineered NK cells 179. Recent work has addressed this concern by locally augmenting chemokine concentrations using a mesothelin-targeting antibody fusion protein loaded with CXCL16, which is cleaved in the TME upon tumour cell engagement 186. Furthermore, recent work has highlighted the application of radiation-induced CXCL8 to enhance NK cell migration to the tumour188. Last, chemokine-receptor interactions may be context- specific, either promoting or abrogating NK cell homing depending on the specific tumour type in question, as has been previously observed184,185. Future research will need to address these important questions and, ulti-mately, validate whether the overall promising findings can prevail in the context of the complex and dynamic interplay of chemokines within the human body. Clinical lessons learned CAR T cell therapy has led to remarkable clinical out-comes, with some patients achieving decade-long remissions in the presence of sustained CAR T cell persistence 1-9. This new form of cellular immuno- therapy has also shown potential for treatment of various cancers, driving the development of an ever- expanding number of new strategies to build on these successes189- 191. The CAR T cell experience has eluci - dated many requirements for successful development of safe and efficacious cell therapies and has also revealed critical challenges related to mechanisms of resistance and barriers to immune effector cell persistence 192, 193. Knowledge gained from the clinical journey with CAR T cells has contributed to the emergence of novel cell therapy modalities. Over the past decade, the field has seen NK cells emerge as a strong new therapeutic can-didate, possessing biological properties that may help overcome some of the limitations seen with T cell-based Licensing A process of education in maturing natural killer (NK) cells that is driven by the interaction of inhibitory receptors and self-major histocompatibility complex class i molecules, which potentiates NK cell responses to activating signals. www.nature.com/nrcReviews 0123456789();: approaches. One noteworthy finding is that early clinical data suggest that NK cells are well suited for use in the allogeneic therapy setting as no major adverse events have been reported thus far in ongoing clinical studies194. Although safety results are encouraging, further inves- tigations are required to elucidate whether allogeneic NK cells are capable of evading recipient T cell rejection for long-term persistence. A growing number of clini-cal studies have shown safety and efficacy of NK cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cord blood, iPSCs, HSPCs and cell lines in the treatment of haematological malignancies 28-30,33,34,37,39,48,49. Moreover, we have learned that, similar to their T cell counterparts, NK cells are quite amenable to genetic modification and numerous clinical candidates have been engineered to target the tumour with greater precision (by expressing CAR) and to increase persistence (through cytokine armouring). In addition, continuous efforts to enhance trafficking to tumour sites (through chemokine receptor editing) (Fig. 4d) and to shield against suppressive factors in the TME (through checkpoint inhibition, metabolic reprogramming (Fig. 4a) and hypoxia tolerance) may lead to enhanced benefits in the clinic. NK cells may also differentiate to a memory-like phenotype that naturally extends the persistence of NK cell function and confers the ability to recall an antitumour response upon antigen re-encounter. Memory NK cells are currently under clin- ical evaluation in the treatment of leukaemia. Moreover, memory-like NK cells pre-complexed with engager mol-ecules provide an alternative to achieving CAR-like spec-ificity without the need for lengthy manufacture 100, and in the clinic, this strategy is driving responses compara- ble with those seen for CAR T cells and CAR NK cells. Importantly, irrespective of the approach, NK cell ther - apies have consistently demonstrated a favourable safety profile, and, to date, with no observed CRS or GvHD. Although tremendous progress has been made, and in a short time NK cells have become an important tool for immuno-oncology, most of the successes reported are limited to haematological malignancies, much like the initial function of CAR T cells. However, there have been challenges. Not all patients respond to NK cell therapy, and some who do, eventually relapse. What are the mechanisms underlying tumour resistance and relapse? Are tumour cells, and, likewise, therapeutic NK cells, evolving in the course of their interactions? Understanding the biological underpinnings that influ-ence patient response is critical to answering these questions. In the current era of single-cell multi-omic capabilities, we are poised to see these challenges as, in fact, opportunities (box 1). Interrogating therapy evolu- tion through a combination of genomic, proteomic and epigenomic profiling might offer valuable insights into changes that permanently 'scar' NK cells into a state of exhaustion and hypo-responsiveness to the tumour, as previously observed in T cells 195, 196. Indeed, we might also identify epigenetic roots to metabolic reprogram- ming that results in low bioenergetic reserves and decreased persistence. Once these mechanisms are elu-cidated, strategizing ways to reverse their effects and rescue cell function, or identifying favourable gene edits that intercept harmful interactions, will play a pivotal role in maximizing the benefit of cellular immunother - apies. Furthermore, implementing combination ther - apy approaches may provide a strategy for achieving a synergistic effect and increasing the efficacy of engi- neered adoptive NK cell therapies (TAble 2). Integration of antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors to prevent metabolite-driven immunosuppression, or blockade of checkpoint and immunosuppressive mechanisms (Fig. 4b,e), for instance, might lead to a multifaceted outcome: boosting CAR NK cell function, hindering signals from suppressive cells in the TME and support- ing the function of other immune effector cells197- 199. Lastly, engineering NK cells to become resistant to CD38-mediated fratricide will enable NK cell-based treatment approaches to be combined with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies and allow NK cell immuno-therapy to move into earlier lines of treatment in the setting of multiple myeloma 50 (Fig. 4f). Although many clinical trials are still in the early stages, through an iterative process we will be able to learn directly from patients what the barriers posed by each cancer are and take this information back to the laboratory where therapies can be further refined into applicable solutions to real-life challenges. Knowledge gained from these investigations will serve as the foun-dation upon which future clinical studies are built and will be critical to achieving success as we move forward and take aim at solid tumours. Through cellular engi- neering strategies and combination therapy approaches, NK cell adoptive therapies for solid tumours will also need to address and overcome challenges related to poor Box 1 | Forward genetic screens to inform the design of next-generation nK cell therapies CRISPR-enabled functional genetic screens allow the systematic interrogation of cancer-intrinsic vulnerabilities towards anti-neoplastic treatments in an unbiased large-scale manner, thereby extending the scope of traditional hypothesis-driven strategies. Over the past decade, many groups have applied these tools to better understand the molecular mechanisms of therapeutic resistance including against T cell immunotherapy 282- 289. Recently, this approach has been adapted to decipher cancer-specific vulnerabilities towards natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapy leveraging an orthogonal multiplexed approach, in which a diverse pool of DNA-barcoded cancer cell lines (PRISM) was examined simultaneously to identify shared transcriptional programmes that correlate with response. These studies hold an intriguing implication as they lay the groundwork for future biomarker-guided approaches to help identify and stratify patients whose tumours might be particularly susceptible to NK cell immunotherapy 290. Translating CRISPR screening to primary immune cells, however, has proved much more challenging. First, primary immune cells are inherently more resistant to stable genetic editing, a prerequisite to reliably uncover genotype-phenotype relationships. Furthermore, limited ex vivo culture time periods prohibit long-term assays to achieve the necessary phenotypic resolution. In 2018, the work of two groups overcame this long-standing limitation. Guide Swap technology, which delivers Cas9 ribonucleoproteins pre-complexed to non-targeting single guide RNA, was successfully used to screen human primary CD4 + T cells291. Another group applied a hybrid approach to screen primary human T cells by combining lentiviral library delivery with Cas9 electroporation 292. Recently, this approach was translated to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells to investigate drivers of functional exhaustion in a reciprocal glioblastoma stem cell screen 293. In its latest iteration, pooled knock-in screens now allow the concurrent assessment of functional consequences of integrating a multitude of transgenes 294, 295. Going forward, these tools will serve as invaluable platforms to decipher fundamental immune cell biology and, in turn, can inform the design of next-generation cellular therapies. NATuRe RevIewS | CanCerReviews 0123456789();: tumour trafficking and limited persistence and effector function in the immunosuppressive TME. Ensuring genomic fidelity in NK cell therapies Given the vast scope and the accelerated pace at which novel insights into fundamental NK cell immuno - biology are generated, we anticipate an increase in novel engineered cell products. It is therefore increasingly important to establish platforms for screening and char - acterization of products to identify unintended genetic alterations resulting from off-target nuclease activity. Concerns that some genomic changes may inadvert-ently lead to oncogenic mutations continue to reverber - ate in the background as the field advances. To address this need, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) have launched the Somatic Cell Genome Engineering (SCGE) programme with two main missions: first to provide financial aid to researchers to facilitate the transfer of genome editing technologies to the clinic, and second, to support the development of more com-prehensive assays to investigate potential adverse bio - logical effects that could result from the use of these tools 200. In addition, various platforms to investigate genome editing fidelity have been developed, such as GUIDE-Seq 201, CIRCLE-Seq202 and rhampSeq203 that rely on sequencing technologies to unbiasedly identify sites in the genome where double-stranded breaks may have occurred. Moreover, unintended genetic rear - rangements may be elucidated by genome-wide translocation sequencing (LAM-HTGTS) 204. As these tools continue to evolve and newer ones are developed, the implementation of such assays in cell therapy devel- opment will be of paramount importance to ensure greater understanding of safety and efficacy of cellular products such as engineered NK cell therapies. Concluding remarks Engineered cellular immunotherapies continue to experience tremendous growth, with diverse modal- ities quickly advancing from preclinical studies into clinical testing. The recent report of in vivo editing of hepatocytes in patients with transthyretin amyloidosis epitomizes the latest frontier in the cell and gene ther - apy space 205. In a related effort, an approach to enable T cell-targeted in vivo CAR transfection using lipid nanoparticles has been developed for the generation of fibroblast activating protein (FAP)-redirected CAR T cells to target cardiac remodelling in the context of myocardial injury 206,207. Moreover, recent work has demonstrated that Nipah lentivirus vectors redirected to CD3, CD8 and CD4 could specifically deliver ther - apeutic genes (such as CAR and TCR) to T cell popu- lations in vivo208. These technical innovations provide a new approach to off-the-shelf personalized therapies, in which targeted viral vectors are readily available to be administered to patients upon need, thereby bypassing the requirement for extensive ex vivo manufacturing, reducing costs and expediting therapy delivery. It is conceivable that targeted in vivo editing may also be applied to tumour cells, driving modifications that will restore their sensitivity to anti-neoplastic agents or elim - inate resistance mechanisms. Although current initia- tives have mostly focused on CAR T cell therapy, in vivo engineering might also be applicable to NK cell-based therapies, such as to boost endogenous NK cell function and persistence, or to increase tumour sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. As the field continues to innovate at a rapid rate, it is important to keep abreast of potential safety risks associated with these various gene editing strategies, as concerns associated with possible off-target effects are very relevant. The recent halt of multiple ongoing cell therapy trials owing to cases of chromosomal abnor - malities, treatment-associated AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or malignant transformation of the infused CAR T cell product 209 justify these concerns and serve as reminders of the importance of closely studying the safety of engineered products. Moreover, it is criti- cal that cell therapy programmes implement pipelines for systematic screening of products to assess potential unwanted genetic modifications that may result in del - eterious effects. Leveraging resources such as the NIH's SCGE programme may provide the initial support needed to launch these initiatives. Although NK cell-based immunotherapy is well positioned as a safe off-the-shelf antitumour therapy, Table 2 | Combinatorial strategies to enhance Car nK cell therapeutic recruit- ment into by inflammation in the Dendritic inhibitorsPDL1 antibody Direct pro-cytotoxic effect TIGIT154 An overview of different combinatorial agents that might be used to further enhance CAR NK cell immunotherapy. Although no concrete dosing schedules have yet been established clinically, combination of one or multiple of these agents with CAR NK cell infusions is conceivable to augment NK cell cytotoxicity and increase tumour immunogenicity parameters that determine NK cell potency and persis- tence will be important as the field progresses into devel- oping approaches to address challenges specific to each disease indication. Moreover, decisions related to use of co-stimulatory signal, cytokine armouring and combi- nation with other therapeutic modalities will play a role in maximizing the longevity and benefit of adoptively transferred NK cells. Finally, it will be critical to develop and implement optimal methods for expansion and cry-opreservation of NK cells to ensure that high product quality is sustained. Logistically, for emerging NK cell therapy programmes to succeed, it will be essential to establish multidisciplinary team structures comprising researchers, clinicians and regulatory officials to jointly sketch a wholistic path to clinical translation.
