You've tried to manage things on your own but feel like nothing is helping. There's this powerlessness that keeps creeping in and this gray cloud hanging over your every move. Your friends say they miss you, but you just can't find the energy to pick up the phone. Your family tries to be supportive, but they keep pushing their bad advice onto you. You sometimes feel guilty for avoiding them. You wish they understood what you're going through but feel like no one can really relate. It seems like life is so much easier for other people, you wonder why you can't figure it out. Therapy for Anxiety & Stress Anxiety and stress feel overwhelming. You're so busy taking care of everyone around you there's no time or energy left for you. Despite this, you struggle with feeling like you aren't doing enough. You can't stop looking over your shoulder and thinking the worst-case scenario will come true. You feel trapped in negative thinking patterns and it's exhausting. You're frustrated that you keep over apologizing and taking responsibility for the actions and feelings of others. You try to convince yourself that if you just get that job, promotion, relationship etc. things will get better. You're about to crack but remind yourself you have to keep it together for friends and family. You're tired of waiting for the other shoe to drop and are ready for things to change. Therapy for Trauma At first you felt nothing. Slowly powerful emotions started to creep in. Suddenly, you started having outbursts of emotion and nightmares that you've never experienced before. Sometimes you feel disconnected, and life seems to go by as if things aren't real. You no longer feel safe in the world or in your own body. You're unsure how other people are still going on with their lives. Don't they know how much pain you're in? Maybe they were there for you at the beginning but now they've gone on to their own problems. You want to feel better but don't want to feel like a burden to anyone. You're tired of feeling alone.

How It Works 1) Schedule a free initial phone consultation In the free 15-minute phone consultation your therapist will ask for a brief overview of what you are wanting to work on in therapy. Think of a 30 second snapshot of what you are wanting to work on the most. I will share how I would approach this concern and answer any questions you might have. 2) Decide if working together is the right fit At the end of our call you can decide if you'd like to move forward and work together. If your therapist can't support you, they will be happy to get you connected to someone in our network who can. We can typically schedule new clients as soon as one week from the initial consultation call. 3) Complete the electronic intake in your client portal We use a HIPAA secure client portal where you can complete your intake documents prior to our first session. Your therapist will ask for some background information, ask you complete some questionnaires, and electronically sign our consent forms. 4) Meet for our first session! We will review the documents you provided prior to our first session and begin creating a map for how we will navigate the therapy journey together. In the initial session we typically complete an assessment with you called a biopsychosocial where we discuss your biological, psychological and social history. This allows us to take a holistic approach to getting to know you and how we can best support you going forward. What Clients Are Saying \"Before meeting Liz, I had cycled through several different counselors - I always felt like I was on a rigid treatment plan with no say in the process. Liz created a comfortable, judgement free space from the first session. She has empowered me to take ownership of my healing journey through compassion, research and guidance. I am so happy with the progress I've made working with Liz, she is truly dedicated to her craft and her clients.\" \"I just wanted to share that I got into film school. I'll be getting my Masters in Fine Arts starting this August. I can thank and credit you & our sessions as the revelation of this journey. Your question, \"what do you want to do? Not your family, but what do you actually want to do with your life?\" opened up the door to imagination, a privilege I didn't know existed for me. My breakdown was the hardest thing I ever experienced in life, but it was worth it looking on the other side. Thank you again for the support those 11 months. They changed my life.\" \"I have received counseling from Liz Hughes for five months now and have had nothing short of a positive experience. Some qualities that I love about Liz's therapy style is her positive approach that is encouraging and empowering. She is great about setting goals and bringing me back to focus.\" \"I have been meeting with Liz for 10 months. In these months my life has been changed in the most positive and unimaginable way. I've been taught so many skills to use. This year has been a truly stressful one (hospitalization, changing jobs and moving homes twice) and with Liz helping me through it, I can now say it is one of my biggest achievements I have overcome. I am a new person thanks to her!\" \"When we stop numbing and start feeling and learning again , we have to reevaluate everything, especially how to choose loving ourselves over making other people comfortable.\" Bren\u00e9 Brown, Atlas Of The Heart \"it's that sometimes the worst moments of our lives, the moments that set us spinning with ugly desires, that threaten to unglue us with the sheer impossibility of the pain we must endure, are in fact the moments that bring us to understand our worth. It's as if we become aware of ourselves as a bridge between all that's been and all that will be. We become aware of all we've received and what we can choose-or choose not-to perpetuate.\" \"Being human is not hard because you're doing it wrong, it's hard because you're doing it right.\" Glennon Doyle, Untamed Want to Schedule an Appointment?
