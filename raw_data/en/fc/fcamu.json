The chiropractic adjustment has a powerful effect on balancing the nervous system by restoring proper motion in spinal and peripheral joint systems throughout the body. Profound improvements in health can be realized with the chiropractic adjustment. Chiropractic adjustments use pressure on joints to move them back into alignment. This can be done with a quick forceful thrust or a slow, gentle motion. Most people are familiar with the idea of a chiropractor helping patients realign their spine.
