Today's herbal supplements often use herbal extracts, a purified and concentrated version of the herb, which provides a higher potency of the plant's active compounds and helps preserve them longer.* Can I take herbal supplements along with prescription medications? Herbal supplements can have potent effects on the body and may interact with certain drugs. You should check with your doctor before taking herbal supplements if you have a health condition or are taking any medications. "}
