I won't go into the details of my sessions as I am sure he uses a different approach to every snowflake, but I will describe how I felt and how I feel today. Ataana helps draw the venom deep within you to the surface. That being said, it is up to you to work hard and release it. If you are looking for someone to wave a magic wand over you and do all the work, 1) don't waste his time or yours 2) you may not be ready for this journey...yet. During close to two years, more salt poured out of my eyes than I thought possible. I went through every emotion and almost gave up swearing I'd never speak to him a million times. The truth is I was healing and transforming and releasing everything he had surfaced from deep within me. So that's where I am today. Accepting all the positive energy that now has room inside me and continuing to work hard to expand that energy to touch every being I meet. This isn't the end to the work; it's actually the beginning; however, I think this work will be more enjoyable. "}
