Steiner's most visible contribution is the Waldorf Schools, attended by children throughout the world and staffed by highly trained teachers. The medicinal path incorporates homeopathy, naturopathy, and some allopathic principles, which provide the foundation for anthroposophically inspired remedies, homecare compresses, and poultices as well as art therapy, music therapy, and movement therapy (eurhythmy). The information in this book from the Wellness Nurses is inspired from anthroposophical principles. "}
