Doctors Without Borders ) OC Operational Centre OCB Operational Centre Brussels SEU Stockholm Unit SQ (Evaluation ) Sub-Question MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 5(62) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease ( Covid -19) is responsible for more than 4 .5 million deaths worldwide.1 The Covid -19 pandemic created a variety of challenges for implementing health promotion (HP) activities for humanitarian organizations, especially regarding limitat ions to person -to-person Operational Centre Brussels (OCB) adapted to this context by scaling up the implementation of Digital Health Promotion (DHP) activities in a variety of contexts, including some where MSF h ad limited or no previous experience. The pilot campaign was launched in Belgium in April 2020 and, to date, 2 7 Covid -19 DHP campaigns have been completed across 1 9 countries . The purpose of this evaluation is to provide an independent assessment of a sample (n=10) of MSF 's Covid - 19 DHP campaigns , which include Belgium, Brazil (Bahia), D emocratic Republic of Congo (D RC), Greece (Moria ), Guinea, Haiti, Palestine (Gaza), Indonesia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. The evaluation was conducted between July and September 2021. The evaluation questions (EQ) are based on five criteria defined by the RE -AIM2 approach (reach, effectiveness, adopti on, implementation, and maintenance). METHODOLOGY This evaluation used a mixed methods approach to answer the evaluation questions, drawing on the following sources of data: 1. Primary data a. Semi-structured interviews (n=12) 2. Secondary data a. Facebook (FB) quantitative campaign metrics b. FB Brand Lift S tudies (BLS) c. Digital Health Promotion Units' ( DHPU ) Microsoft Form s analysis d. Sherlog documents (n=49) e. Desk review documents (65) f. Peer-reviewed and grey literature (n=26) . Qualitative and quantitative analysis was conducted using MAXQDA3 and Excel . 1 MSF OCB -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 6(62) KEY FINDINGS The absolute number of individu als reached during each of the campaigns was high. However, due to lack of baseline data within the program documents I had access to , there is no way to measure the adequacy or success of the overall reach . There were mixed results regarding the effectiveness of the campaigns . Beneficiary comments analysed by the DHPU indicate that there were more negative attitudes than positive attitudes towards the campaigns. However, the ambiguity surrounding the categor ies used in analysis, as well as the gaps in the dataset , are problematic for drawing conclusions. The FB BLS reveal that the campaigns in Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa had some impact on beneficiaries, but there was no impact reported for Zimbabwe. HP focal points reported positive experiences with DHP, contributing to their willingness to adopt DHP in the future. The field teams we re able to successfully implement the DHP campaigns in accordance with the process outlined by the DHPU. Most HP focal points attributed this success to the support they received from the DHPU. Regarding maintenance , DHP has impacted MSF as an organization by creating visibility , enhancing the capability of MSF to adapt to contemporary trends , and by provid ing a framework that will allow MSF to incorporate DHP into regular operations. While it is not possible to determine the impacts o n beneficiaries with the available program data, likely impacts include developing trust in MSF and access to emotional support and referrals . Recommendations To address the second objective of the evaluation, the evaluator led a participatory workshop to co -create practical recommendations based on the evaluation results. Participants included the evaluator, members of the SEU, and the commissioners of the evaluation. The following recommendations were identified: 1. Develop transversal collaborations within MSF to create a more robust monitoring and evaluation (ME) system for digital health promotion (DHP) a. Draw on existing resources to develop and implement ME tools b. Strengthen relationships between the DHPU, SEU, MSF -OCB, and MSF to develop an ME framework c. Formalize the roles of the DHP field teams wi thin MSF as an organization 2. Enhance the existing strengths of the DHPU by expanding HR a. Offer more technical training and support to field teams, which could include a training of trainer's program b. Add an additional member of DHPU to manage ME framework 3. Increasing continuity between health promotion (HP) and DHP a. Increase accessibility to DHP resources within the HP context b. Create more internal awareness about HP and DHP frameworks, guidance documents, and resources Overall, the recommendations identified du ring the participatory workshop provide practical examples of how to strengthen MSF's DHP initiatives. While the evaluation identified many gaps that need to be filled in order to determine the success of the programs, it is clear from the desk review (see Annex 13) and semi -structured interviews, that DHP is part of a broader global trend towards digitization of health services and HP. As such, efforts to strengthen DHP activities should be integrated into MSFs HP strategy. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 7(62) INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF ) has responded to the Covid -19 pandemic in more than 70 countries across Asia & Pacific, the Middle East & Northern Africa, Africa, Europe & Central Asia, and the Americas.4 In the context of Covid -19, MSF provides expertise in emergency response to countries with robust health systems and direct care in low -resource settings with fragile health systems. During the Covid -19 pandemic, MSF has focused on supporting authorities to provide care for Covid -19 patients, protecting people who are vulnerable and at risk, and keeping essential medical services running.5 Across these projects, MSF teams work to improve Covid -19 infection and prevention control measures as well as suppor t critical medical activities that need to be maintained or adapted during the global health crisis, such as malaria prevention and cholera outbreaks.6 MSF has also maintained an active role in HP, despite the challenges that the Covid -19 pandemic has created, especially regarding limitations to person -to-person contact.7 One of the ways that MSF -OCB has confronted these challenges is by increasing Digital Health Promotion (DHP ) implementation in a variety of contexts.8 In 2020, MSF -OCB created a Digital Health Promotion Unit (DHP U) to work with field teams to develop and implement Covid -19 DHP campaigns, launching the pilot in Belgium in April, 2020. To date, 24 Covid -19 campaigns have been completed in 18 countries, and some are ongoing. This evaluation assesses the completed 2-way campaigns9, including Belgium, Greece (Moria), Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Haiti, and Palestine (Gaza), as well as 1-way campaigns with a Brand Lift Studies ( BLS) component, which includes Brazil (Bahia), Indonesia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. THE DIGITAL HEALTH PROMOTION UNIT MSF has long -recognized the importance of digitally supported global health and began plementing Telemedicine in 2010.7 MSF -OCB first piloted DHP campaigns in South Africa in 2018 to complement existing HP strategies. Once the pandemic started, DHPU was formalized under the Covid -19 task force. The team spent most of 2020 focusing their efforts on Covid -19. While the DHPU c ontinues to work on Covid -19 projects, the unit also collaborates with HP managers in the field to address other relevant health concerns, such as Tuberculosis, sexual and reproductive health, and HIV.10 Housed in the Medical Department, the DHPU facilit ates the process of DHP campaign implementation among operations through capacity -building with HP field managers and their teams, as well as providing the structure for each specific digital campaign. The process starts when an HP manager or field team fo cal 4 https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/covid19 5 https://www.msf.org/covid -19 6 \"RESPONDING TO Covid -19: 2-way campaigns allow beneficiaries to converse with first responders directly through messaging 10 Discussion with MSF Personnel MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 8(62) point contacts the DHPU for support in developing a DHP campaign. First, an assessment is conducted to explore the resources available (e.g., budget, human resources (HR), etc.), technical capacities of the field teams, and technological feasibility wi thin the target population (e.g., social media and WhatsApp accessibility). Subsequently, the DHPU creates a strategy with the field teams, which includes technical training and gathering messaging. The DHPU uses assessment data and messaging to create a s tructure for the campaign (1 -way11/2-way, digital platform, etc.) and visual content. After content is pretested, the campaign is implemented. The DHPU also monitors campaign messaging, provides support to the field teams, manages and analyses DHP campaign data, and recently started to implement BLS . BLS12 is a Facebook ( FB) tool which analyses the performance of advertisements and is used by the DHPU to assess campaign impacts on beneficiaries. It is important to note that other MSF Operational Centres (OC) have implemented DHP campaigns (e.g., Operational Centre Barcelona -Athens), but MSF -OCB was the first to do so, and has elaborated a DHP Toolbox,13 which is shared with MSF stakeholders. MSF -OCB DHPU is also collaborating with some OCs (e.g., Operational Centre Amsterdam and Operational Centre Geneva) to incorporate DHP into future missions to complement existing HP progamm ing.8 DHP COVID -19 CAMPAIGNS To date, the DHPU has supported the operations of 27 Covid -19 DHP campaigns (see Annex 1 for a complete list of Covid -19 DHP campaigns) across 19 countries in 2020 and 2021. Due to the predetermined timeline for this evaluatio n (see Annex 2 for Terms of Reference) a sample of Covid -19 campaigns (n=10) was identified and assessed (see Annex 3 for sample characteristics). The sample includes the 2 -way campaigns (n=6) completed to date and 1 -way campaigns with a BLS component (n=4) . Two -way campaigns provide beneficiaries with opportunities to engage with the HP field teams in some way (e.g., via FB or WhatsApp conversations). Campaigns with a BSL component have the po tential to measure changes in health behaviour associated with HP.14 This is valuable for exploring dimensions of the evaluation related to beneficiary outcomes. One -way campaigns provide visual content to the target population with more limited engagement than 2 -way campaigns (e.g., via comments, video views, etc.) (see Table 1 for definitions of terms commonly used in DHP and Annex 4 for a more complete list ). Each Covid -19 DHP campaign ha d its own objectives related to various HP topics, including Covid -19 awareness and prevention, addressing concerns about co -morbidities (e.g., Covid -19 and HIV), and dispelling rumours (see Annex 5 for a complete list of campaign objectives). Target popula tions also vary and include entire populations (16+ or 18+), migrants, asylum seekers, and homeless individuals, and specific communities (Camp Moria, community in Gaza City, Arabic, Amharic, and Tigrinya speakers) (see Table 9 below for a complete list of target populations) . 11 1-way campaigns provide content to beneficiaries without direct interaction with firs t responders 12 https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1693381447650068?id=546437386202686 13 Hein, Jakub. n.d. \"Digital Health Promotion Toolbox: THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO MISSIONS CONSIDERING OR STARTING DIGITAL HEALTH PROMOTION INTERVENTIONS.\" v0.3 al., 2019. \"The Survey Model - Knowledge Attitude and Practices.\" Data Collection: Quantitative Methods.

EVALUATION OBJECTIVES The objectives of the evaluation are twofold: 1. Determine how successful the DHP campaigns in the sample (n=10) have been by: a. Identifying good practices b. Identifying areas of improvement 2. Co-create recommendations with key stakeholders from/for the Digital Health Promotion Unit, Health Promotion referent, and Medical Directors. EVALUATION QUESTIONS The evaluation questions (EQs) and sub -questions (SQs) were developed collaboratively with the commissioners of the evaluation (see Table 2 for evaluation questions). The R E-AIM Approach16 was used as a guiding framework due to its widespread application i n planning, monitoring, and evaluation of HP programming, and increasingly of DHP activities (see Annex 6 for key definitions associated with this framework). Additionally, the emphasis this approach places on evaluating aspects of the setting level (i.e., the institutions and individuals engaging in implementation) is appropriate for this evaluation, since there is limited data on how the DHP campaigns impacted beneficiary behaviour. The RE -AIM approach explores 5 dimensions: reach, effectiveness, adoption , implementation, and maintenance. 15 https://www.facebook.com/business/help?ref=mobile_logo 16 https://www.re -aim.org/ MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 10(62) Table 2.

This evaluation is rooted in approaches from influential evaluation , a type of formative evaluation,17 which emphasize the ways that the lessons learned from the evaluation can be used to improve ongoing and future programs. This is achieved by including stakeholders in a collaborative and active process of reflecting on the evaluation process and results. The evaluator relied on both primary and secondary data sources . Primary data was collected using semi - structured interviews with key informants (KII) (n=1 2). Secondary data included the following: FB quantitative campaign metrics BLS DHPU Microsoft Fo rms Sherlog documents (n=49) Desk review documents (65) Peer reviewed and grey literature (n= 26) Qualitative d ata were analysed using MAXQDA , a mixed methods analysis software and quantitative data was analysed using Excel.

The sampling strategy was based on 1) the accessible data for the DHP campaigns and 2) the timeline for the evaluation. The DHP campaign sample consisted of the 2 -way Covid -19 campaigns (n=6) completed to date as well as the campaigns that had a BLS component (n=4). The sample strategy for KIs was similar. The sample consisted of individuals who could provide in -depth perspectives across and within the campaigns to identify good practices and areas for improvement. The timeframe for the evaluation also informed the sample size. Originally, 17 KIs were identified. This included, HP field managers or focal points ( n=10), the DHPU team (n=4), and key MSF personnel (n=2) (see Table 4). However, of the ten campaigns included in the sample, two had the same focal point and two focal points were not available for an interview. Additionally, due to the summer holiday, it was not possible to interview more than one individual from MSF -OCB headquarters (MSF key personnel). Overall, 16 individuals were contacted for interviews and 12 agreed to participate, resulting in a 75% response rate. This included HP field managers or f ocal points (n=7), the DHPU team (n=4), and key MSF personnel (n=1) (see Table 4). SEMI -STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS Semi -structured interviews w ere conducted via Zoom , Teams , or WhatsApp . Each interview guide was tailored to the specific context of the role of the participant (for an example interview guide, see Annex 7). With permission of participants, all interviews were audio -recorded. Interviews were transcribed for qualitative analysis (see Annex 8 for a lis t of KIs consulted) .

DHP campaign documents include d overarching documents, BLS reports, and final reports (n=65) . HP documents (n=49) include d strategies, guidelines, manuals, and other relevant documenta tion (e.g., documents, presentations, and webinars) from Sherlog (MSF -OCB's internal system for collaboration and information sharing. Additionally, peer -reviewed and grey literature (n= 26) was consulted to frame the results of the evaluation in the context of other validated works. The evaluator was given access to Sherlog, the internal information -sharing site used by MSF -OCB. The evaluator used the following search terms to find docume nts relevant to this evaluation: \"Health promotion\" and \"digital health promotion.\" In addition, the evaluation commissioners identified specific content (documents, presentations, and webinars) to be included in this review. These MSF documents provide th e official context and framework for answering some of the evaluation questions, since MSF - OCB provides the official guidance documents and HP frameworks for application in the field. Documents from Sherlog were included in the desk review if they met th e following criteria: 1. They were focused on HP frameworks used by MSF 2. They were official HP guidance documents (used within MSF or MSF -OCB) 3. They were digital HP guidance materials used by MSF or MSF -OCB 4. General Digital HP materials used by MSF or MSF -OCB 5. Material on Covid -19 and or Covid -19 and DHP MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 15(62) BRAND LIFT STUDIES BLS is a FB mechanism which measures how well advertising performs using a lift test.18 A lift test is an experiment using two groups of people; a group that saw the advertisements and a group that did not (i.e. a control group).19 Each group is asked to respond to a series of questions. The results include a confidence percentage (i.e., lik elihood of a causal result) and a lift percentage (i.e. the percentage higher that your brand survey performed in the group that saw the advertisements in comparison with the control group). For DHP, the BLS questions are based on those commonly used in Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices surveys . This mechanism allows MSF to determine impacts on beneficiaries who are exposed to the DHP campaigns. For the DHPU, this is a new assessment tool, therefore data w ere only available for Brazil, Indonesia, South Af rica, and Zimbabwe. RAW AND EXISTING DATA During the inception phase, raw and existing data sources were identified by key stakeholders. Quantitative data are generated for each campaign in the sample. This includes reach, impressions, frequencies, link clicks, post comments, post engagement, post reactions, and thruplays. These sources of raw data were incorporated into an Excel spreadsheet and an alysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data are also man aged for each campaign, which include d comment s that have already been synthesized by the DHPU and field teams via Microsoft Forms. The evaluator used the Excel spreadsheets generated by Forms for analysis in Excel . Data include d topics of conversation related to the campaign, tone, and attitude of comments. ANALYSIS Qualitative data from semi -structured interviews and desk review documents w ere analysed using a layered analysis approach,20 beginning with a round of deductive coding based on the evaluation questions and RE -AIM criteria (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance). The codebook includes the RE -AIM criteria and specific constructs associated with each sub -question (e.g. facilitators and barriers) (see Annex 9 for the MAXQDA codebook). This was followed by a round of inductive coding. This technique is used to identify other themes in the data relevant to this evaluation, such as the impacts that capacity -building and technical training have on field teams. 18 https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1693381447650068?id=546437386202686 19 https://www.facebook.com/business/help/552097218528551?id=546437386202686 20 Bernard, H. Russell. Research Methods in Anthropology: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches. Rowman & Littlefield, 2017. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 16(62) LIMITATIONS AND MITIGATING FACTORS There are a number of limitations and mitigating factors that impact ed this evaluation. First, due to the limited time frame for which the evaluation is scheduled, it was not possible to analyse primary data from all of the Covid -19 DHP campaigns. The evaluator created a specific sampling strategy to address this limitation (i.e., to focus on the 2 -way campaigns and 1 -way campaigns with BSL surveys), but it is still important to note. The timing of the evaluation was also a factor, as there was lagged response (or no response) from some KIs due to the summer holidays in Europe. This may have impacted the KI response rate. The evaluator also recognize d certain limitations due to the Covid -19 pandemic. Namely, the evaluator could not travel due to Covid -19-related restrictions and safety concerns, making the evaluation completely remote in nature. This comes with its own challenges. Primarily, technology was a concern, regarding internet quality in some locations as well as access to both internet and communication applications, such as Zoom or Teams. This disrupted interview times more than once, but rescheduling was possible. There were also limited opp ortunities to build rapport with KIs, which could impact how much they disclose d to the evaluator during data collection. There were some concerns about anonymity in reporting of the data. To address this, the evaluator has not used the specific campaign n ames when quoting individuals or citing specific information. The sample size is small and the privacy of KIs is an important concern. The evaluator was transparent in the inception report about the limitations of assessing the projects' impacts due to a lack of baseline in the available data , closing data on beneficiaries' behaviours and the level of access the evaluator had to reporting functions on FB . While the original methodology entailed focus ing on the qualitative aspects of beneficiary experience s (i.e. positive or negative) as indicated in participants' comments and conversations via social media platforms , it was not possible to access raw data. Finally, MSF uses FB advertising for DHP campaigns. Data related to measuring the campaigns is prod uced by FB and accessible by the DHPU. While this includes a variety of measurements, use of these data for analysis is limited due to the way the data are collected and reported (see Annex 10 for more information on this). For example, data from various campaigns within each country cannot be simply added to accurately describe the reach (number of people who saw your ads at least once) for that country due to the way that FB calculates metric s based on sampling. Data was cross -check ed using project documents. In cases where there was a discrepancy, the data from FB was used. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS MSF's humanitarian action across the sites where the DHP campaigns were implemented involves wo rk with at -risk and marginalized populations. This requires an appropriate level of sensitivity that draws on evidence -based work among these groups. The evaluator consider ed each project setting and context when developing data collection instruments. Whi le the evaluator did not work directly with any of these populations for this evaluation, it is a consideration worth noting. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 17(62) As the DHP campaigns were implemented in a digital space over social media, privacy and confidentiality are important concerns. M embers of the DHPU have indicated that measures are already in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of beneficiary data (e.g., screening comments and conversations for private and sensitive data). To ensure that these policies are upheld throug hout the evaluation, the evaluator clarif ied the specifics of the DHPU's policies and protocols regarding privacy and confidentiality of information collected and shared during the DHP campaigns. The evaluator develop ed a standard verbal informed consent process for all KIs to ensure their participation was voluntary, they underst ood why their information was being collected, and were aware of how it w ould be used. Regarding data management, all data was confidential and stored in a secure location. It w as only accessible to the evaluator . During reporting, all data is anonymous. Data will only be used for the purposes of this external evaluation. Once the evaluation is completed, the Head of Evaluation Unit will be responsible for the disposal of data in accordance with MSF policy on the disposal of records. The evaluator has also read the Stockholm Evaluation Unit (SEU) ethical guidelines for evaluation and agrees to adhere to the practices outlined in the document.21 21 SEU ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION, MSF -SEU, March 2020 MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 18(62) RESULTS REACH REACH OF DHP CAMPAIGNS EQ1: WAS THE REACH OF THE COVID -19 DHP CAMPAIGNS ADEQUATE ACCORDING TO EACH CAMPAIGN'S STATED OBJECTIVE AND TARGET POPULATION? It was not possible to independently assess how adequate the reach (i.e., absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of beneficiaries) 22 was based on campaign objectives and the available data (for campaign objectives see Annex 5). This finding is attr ibuted to two factors. First, p otential reach was not adequately defined in project documents, objectives, or when describing the target population. Campaign documents often identify the target population as everyone in the population over the age of 18. Second, the lack of readily available baseline data on population characteristics (e.g., gender, language, ethnicity, etc.) makes it impossible to determine how successful the reach was for each campaign, or for the campaigns overall. For example, the pilot campaign aimed to target migrants, asylum seekers, and homeless individuals who speak specific languages , although no baseline data that I had access to was available in project documents or elsewhere. Overall, i t is unclear if the individuals who saw and/or engaged with the campaigns (e.g., through conversations, comments, link clicks, etc.) are representative of the target populations since the target populations are broadly defined or lack population characteri stics in project documents . Table 5 outlines the estimated calculations of proportion and representativeness of beneficiaries. 23 The evaluator used baseline data from the campaign reports. When no data was available, the evaluator identified data points f rom other credible sources. The source of each data point is indicated in the footnotes. Despite these limitations, quantitative indicators of the campaigns appear high . Key informants (KI) ( (n=1 2) agreed that the reach across the campaigns in the sample was adequate based on the target populations identified. This was facilitated by FB's geo -targeting capabilities. As one KI noted, \" the thing is that, in pools like FB you can segment who will see your advertising, not like billboard or newspaper where you cannot control who sees it.\" A couple of KIs (n=2) were surprised that they were able to reach older adults, as they were perceived to have low participation on social media. Others (n=2) see the potential in using geo - targeting in the future, to target specific age ranges or other hard -to reach populations that they work with. KIs also identified various challenges involving reach of target populations. This include d, not having culturally or context appropriate campaign content (n=4) (e.g., in local language s), access issues regarding the technology (n=4) (i.e., government restrictions on social media and the lack of internet connection among target population) , Limited HR to respond to beneficiaries (n=1), and local context (n=1) .24 22 https://www.re -aim.org/about/what -is-re-aim/reach/ 23 The evaluator identi fied baseline data points for reference when they were too limited in the project documents to make any assessment. 24 One KI noted that events in the local environment could be disruptive to running the DHP campaigns, which was identified as a challenge. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 19(62) A couple of KIs (n=2) were also concerned that the good quantitative results (reach, impressions, etc.) would not be possible if they had to use their own budget. The DHPU paid for many of the Covid -19 campaigns, although FB data shows that MSF paid for three campaigns and FB paid for the rest as part of their dedication to the Covid -19 response. Table 5.

FB metrics include data points related to engagement, such as link clicks, post comments, and post reactions . However here are important limitations with the way that data are collected and reported. For example, post engagement reflects the total actions taken, not the unique actions. Therefore, this doesn't account for multiple actions taken by one individual. This is similar for 3 -second video plays. Data from FB indicates , that across the campaign s (n=10) , quantitative measure s of beneficiary engagement include (for complete quantitative data for each campaign, see Annex 11): Impressions: However, data shared by DHPU from their own monitoring system, involving the use of Microsoft Forms, indicates that there were 16771 comments across 8 campaigns .42 This discrepancy highlights the need for more accurate and transparent monitoring and reporting mechanisms. 38 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=GN 39 This data point comes directly from the Guinea final report 40 https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?lo cations=ZW 41 Excludes data from Greece. Due to FB data limitations, there is no way to calculate total reach accurately. 42 There is no monitoring data from Belgium and Greece, as these were pilot programs and the current DHPU monitoring system was not yet in place MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 21(62) EFFECTIVENESS IMPACT OF CAMPAIGNS ON BENEFICIARIES EQ2: WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPAIGNS ON BENEFICIARIES AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR COMMENTS AND LEX DEC (AND KAP SURVEYS WHEN AVAILABLE)? Unfortunately, the raw FB data regarding comments, conversations, and BLS was not available due to data protection concerns . Therefore, it was not possible to determine the impact of the campaigns on beneficiaries using primary data. However, comments from the campaigns were recorded by each HP field manager or focal point and input to Microsoft Forms for internal DHPU monitoring . Data on the tone of the comment as well as the attitude of the comment were available for Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe (3744 comments). However, these concepts were not defined, making their interpretation subjective. Additionally, there were no data on the conversations after the comments were responded to. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the interactions with first responders impacted beneficiaries. Based on a monitoring system set up by the DHPU in Microsoft forms there were mixed results when attempting to measure the beneficiary impacts. Across the campaigns, the tone was overall rational (n=1616, 55%), but some beneficiaries were emotional (n=680, 23%) and a ggressive (n=432, 15%) (see Figure 1). Regarding the attitude of the comments, there were more negative comments (1429, 39%) than positive comments (1048, 29%), indicating that the campaigns were perceived more negatively by the population (see Figure 2). However, it is not possible to determine if the negative attitudes were towards the campaigns themselves or the campaign topics (e.g., Covid -19). Further, it's unclear how the impacts on beneficiaries after the comments were addressed by the MSF field team s. Despite this, s ome KIs (n= 4) noted that they received appreciative messages from beneficiaries, indicating that the campaigns had a positive impact. Figure 1. Tone of comments 432; 15% 680; mocking/memes/gif RationalMSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 22(62) Figure 2. Attitude of comment towards message Brand Lift Studies43 The BLS results from FB also show mixed results. BLS include questions that assess areas commonly found on K nowledge, Attitudes, and Practices survey s, to determine impacts on beneficiaries who were exposed to MSF's campaigns . There is some evidence to suggest beneficiaries who saw or engaged with some campaigns were impacted , as is the case for Brazil. Findings were mixed for Indonesia and South Africa and there does not appear to be an impact on beneficiaries for Zimbabwe. As noted in the methodology, FB compares two groups of users; one group who has seen the advertisements a nd one who has not (i.e., the control group). The overall \"lift\" is the difference in score between the two groups, in their response to specific questions . Brazil The Covid -19 campaigns in Brazil had FB objectives involving brand awareness (i.e., advert isement recall) , traffic (i.e., directing individuals to a specific destination via link clicks, for example), and reach, and the BLS assessed the following: Organizational trust o Do you agree or disagree that MSF is a reliable source of facts and information on the Covid -19 vaccine? Attitude o How important is wearing a mask in public and washing your hands with soap to help stop the spread of Coronavirus ( Covid -19)? 43 While the FB results provide data for a more nuanced understanding of how beneficiaries were impacted by the MSF campaigns (e .g., by gender, age, and question response), exploring these details was not appropriate for this evaluation, as the target groups were broadly defined. 16; comment towards message N=3647 Angry Negative Neutral Not clear Positive Question SarcasticMSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 23(62) Safety o How safe do you think a vaccine against Covid -19 is? While FB reported good scores for ad recall, reach, and traffic, the results regarding organizational trust, attitude and safety were mixed. For organization al trust there was some lift on traffic ( +2.5 pts), but not reach. For attitude, there was slight lift on reach ( +1.4 pts), but none for traffic , and for safety, there was lift on traffic ( +3.8 pts) but non e for reach. These findings indicate that there may be an impact on beneficiaries regarding trust in MSF and attitudes and knowledge surrounding Covid -19 after seeing MSF's campaigns , compared to the control group . Indonesia Of the campaigns in Indonesia with the objectives of video views, brand awareness, and reach, the following topics were assessed through the BLS : Actions to stop the spread of C19 How important to keep physical distance How important to wear a mask Maintained hand hygiene in the past 2 days Worn a mask in the past 2 days FB reported a correlation between frequency, ad recall, and lift in responses to questions on physical distancing ( +3.0 pts), and how important it was to wear a mask ( +1.5 pts) and if they wore a mas k in the past 2 days ( +1.8 pts). This lift in percentage points in comparison with the control indicat es that there may have been an impact on beneficiaries' knowledge and practices due to seeing MSF's FB campaigns. FB did not find any correlation between frequency and engagement metrics or the lift in responses . Similarly, FB did no t identify any correlation between video engagement, ad recall , and the lift in responses , indicating that there was not an impact on beneficiaries' knowledge and attitudes after watching the videos associated with MSF's FB campaigns. South Africa For the Covid -19 campaign in South Africa, the BLS assessed the following: Perceived knowledge (+1.5 pts ) o How confident are you that you could explain how Covid -19 vaccines work to a close friend or family member? Safety (+.9 pts) o How safe do you think a Covid -19 vaccine is? Organization trust (+2.6 pts) o Do you agree or disagree that Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is a trustworthy source of Covid -19 vaccine facts and information? The data summary provided by FB indicates that for ad recall, lift was good (+3.4 pts) . There was lift regarding perceived knowledge and organizational trust, indicating that there was an impact for beneficiaries who saw the MSF campaign in these two areas. However, there was not much lift regarding safety, indicating that there may not be an impact for beneficiaries regarding knowledge about vaccine safety . MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 24(62) Zimbabwe The BLS for Zimbabwe focused on assessing the following: Perceived knowledge (+1.7 P ts) o How confident are you that you could explain how Covid -19 vaccines work to a close friend or family member? Organizational trust (+.5 pts) o Do you agree or disagree that Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is a trustworthy source of Covid -19 vaccine facts and information? Safety (+.6 pts) o How safe do you think a Covid -19 vaccine is? While the FB summary indicates that the standard ad recall was high (+5.2 pts) , there was no lift for organizational trust, slight lift for perceived knowledge, and no lift for safety . This indicates that this campaign did not have an impact on beneficiaries ' knowledge or attitudes after being exposed to MSF's campaign. SQ2: Were there any unintended impacts (positive or negative)? There were numerous unintended impacts from th e Covid -19 campaigns (see Annex 12). The most frequently mentioned were : having to address other beneficiary concerns (n=7) and capacity -building among field teams (n=6). When beneficiaries spoke with the responders, they sometimes asked for legal advice, where they can find food, where they can get medical attention for non -Covid -19 health concerns and had questions about other current health issues ( i.e., Ebola outbreak and the bombing in Gaza). This also resulted in providing mental health support to the beneficiaries, and the recogni tion that there is a mental health burden for the MSF field team. Capacity -building was also recognized as an unintended outcome of the camp aigns (n=6). Through training on how to do DHP, field teams learned technical skills. Some also commented that they felt independent enough to run their own DHP campaigns in the future without the DHPU. ADOPTION INFLUENCE FACTORS ON PROGRAM ADOPTION EQ3: WHICH FACTORS INFLUENCED PROGRAM ADOPTION FOR THE FIELD TEAMS? SQ3: Would field teams adopt DHP programs in the future? Why or why not? All the field KIs (n=7) agreed that they would adopt DHP program in the future. MSF field teams i n the sample learned about DHP internally through DHPU awareness -raising efforts (n=2) or via word of mouth (n=2) and agreed to adopt Covid -19 DHP as part of their HP strategy based on their previous positive experiences with DHP (n=3) and their understand ing that they can reach many beneficiaries (n=3). This may also be related to the positive experiences that many KIs had with the DHPU (n=5) (discussed in detail below). MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 25(62) IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENT ATION OF CAMPAIGN S EQ4: WERE OPERATIONS STAFF ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT EACH CAMPAIGN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCESS OUTLINED BY THE DIGITAL HEALTH PROMOTION UNIT AND HP BEST PRACTICES AS OUTLINED BY MSF -OCB? Overall, the staff were able to implement the DHP campaigns in accordance with the process outli ned by the DHPU. This process was facilitated by the support they received from the DHPU. And the guidance materials, which were utilized by more than half of field KIs (n=4) consulted. This includes the DHP Toolbox44 and the Question -and-Answer documents. However, w hen field KIs (n=7) were asked about applying MSF -OCB's current HP framework to DHP, only one indicated that they actively used the materials, which used to be provided via flash drive, but are now accessible on Sherlog. Another KI noted that they have used HP principles for many years but do not actively apply the MSF -OCB HP framework. SQ4.1: What factors facilitated successful implementation? Of the field personnel interviewed for this evaluation (n=7), the majority (n=5) attribu ted the success of their campaigns to their collaboration with the DHPU. This included training (n=6), technical support (n=5) , providing guidance documents (n=4), regular communication (n=4), accessib ility and availab ility of the team when nee ded (n=4), monitoring and evaluation (n=3), content design (n=3), and feedback (n=2) . SQ4.2: What factors were barriers or challenges to implementation? KIs identified various challenges to implementation, including operations (n=10), relationships with stakeholders (8), technical difficulties (n=5), and the local context (n=5) , among others . Operations A central challenge identified by KIs was d efining the new operations for the DHP in the field (n= 10). This included the role of DHP in the field (n= 6), monitoring and reporting (n=4), and the lack of HR (n=3), and turnover of field staff (n=2). Overall, it was unclear to field teams what resources they would need to setup the DHP and how it would operate. For example, one KI noted : \"But how do they do it? Do they need to be in an office, ya know with chairs? With tables? With good internet? And then at one point some of them [the responders], they had like one or two messages a day, especially at the beginning. It is also supe r boring for the team when you know there is other work to be done, and to be inside in an office...when you don't have so much to do. So, in terms of being able to keep 44 Hein, Jakub. n.d. \"Digital Health Promotion Toolbox:THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO MISSIONS CONSIDERING OR STARTING DIGITAL HEALTH PROMOTION INTERVENTIONS.\" Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 26(62) them motivated at the beginning it was a bit hard and then at one point we found another way to be more flexible and for them to answer with their phone. But this took a bit of time at the beginning. I was just like, 'but can we do it with a phone?' It was a bit like, being able to frame that better in terms of HR and everything was a bit com plicated especially at the beginning.\" Additionally, monitoring and reporting (n=4) was a challenge for two reasons. First, it was difficult to continually monitor the campaigns and interactions with beneficiaries. As one project document indicated, \"we w ere constantly assessing challenges and questions until we constantly improve the work of the campaign through meetings with DHP team, monitoring of the quality of answers and regular feedback from line managers. \" Second, some KIs pointed out that they did not see the campaign data until the end of the campaign. This was problematic for them, as they were responsible for reporting to others in the field and writing reports that required the campaign data. It was also difficult to transition the HP field t eams to do the DHP, as personnel had to transfer their communication skills to a digital space. In one instance, the field team perceived the DHP personnel as not working, since they were sitting in an office all day. It was also unclear to some field team s where HP started and Communications stopped as there are overlapping elements to both roles operating in a digital space. Similarly, the relationship between the Medco and the DHP was not well defined, and at least one KI would have liked more support fr om the Medco when responding to beneficiaries. A couple of KIs also mentioned that turnover in the field was an issue because the transition in personnel could change the field team's attitude about DHP. Relationships with Stakeholders Another challenge to implementation that KIs identified was the relationship between various stakeholders (n=8). This includes the relationship between the DH PU and the field teams (n=6), the relationship between MSF and local entities (e.g., ministry of health) (n=2), and the relationship between the emergency team and the field team (n=1). As previously noted, KIs agreed that the DHPU offered a lot of suppo rt during implementation. They also identified numerous challenges to working with the DHP U, which included agreement between the field team and the DHPU regarding campaign content (n=3), working from a distance (n=2), miscommunication between the teams (n =1), and the power imbalance (n=1). In some cases, there was disagreement between the field teams and DHPU regarding content for campaigns. This was attributed to lack of cultural context and indecisiveness among specific personnel. While miscommunication and power imbalances were only described by one individual, it is still important to note . The KI pointed out that the underlying power imbalance between field teams and HQ posed a challenge for their working relationship, as there may be hesitancy on the part of the field teams to be forthcoming about their own technical skills and overall preparedness for the campaigns. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 27(62) Technical Difficulties Technical challenges were also part of the KI experience (n= 5). KIs reported that the technical requirement (having the correct equipment and internet connect) could be a challenge for some (n=2) . Also, learning how to use the FB platform to communicate with beneficiaries was difficult for others (n=2), and in one case there was a pause in the campai gn (n=1) due to technical issues. Local Context The local context was challenging for implementation (n=5) due to the lack of local health care, which made referrals very difficult (n=3). Also, in some cases, target populations had other priorities besid es Covid -19 (e.g., food and healthcare) ( n=3). Finally, people's perception within the local context as well as keeping up with the changing context of Covid -19 (n=1) (e.g., latest guidance) made implementation difficult . Other KIs noted other challenges , such as knowing how to respond to beneficiaries (n=4), campaign delays (n=4), the lack of pre -testing or pre -assessment (n=2), budget (n=2), reliance on the DHPU (n=2), field teams' resources (n=1), and English as the dominant working language of the DHPU (n=1). SQ4.3: Were campaigns appropriately adapted to the specific contexts? While most KIs agreed (n=9) that the Covid -19 campaigns were well adapted to the context, some (n=4) also noted that there were ways that they could have been better adapted to the local context. Well adapted While the local context of Covid -19 was conti nuing to change on the ground, some KIs attributed the success of the campaigns to their alignment with these changes. For example, introducing vaccine messages when vaccines were arriving. In one setting, the topic of vaccines was already trending when th e MSF Covid -19 campaign started. Another KI indicated that the team (field team and DHPU) were able to work together to adapt messages and tailor interactions with beneficiaries to the context as it evolved on the ground. Better adapted The KIs that felt the campaigns could have been better adapted (n=4) cited various reasons that were context and campaign specific. This included running the campaigns in more local languages (n=1) and using design s produced locally (n=1) . One KI noted that the messaging was not updated from one campaign to the next in their context. Since the context on the ground was changing, this could have been improved. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 28(62) THE MOST VALUABLE OUTCOME EQ5: WHICH PARTS OR ASPECTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS GENERAT ED THE MOST VALUABLE OUTCOME FOR THE TIME, MONEY AND EFFORT INVESTED? According to KIs, reach (e.g., the ability to reach many individuals) and various aspects of operations (cost, resources, time) generated the most valuable outcomes for the context of ti me, money and effort invested. Operations KIs highlighted characteristics of operations (n=8) as the most valuable aspects of the campaigns, considering the time, money, and effort invested (see Table 6). This includes the Cost (n=7) , low resources (n=2), and the relatively short time that it takes to setup and run a campaign (n=2). As one KI noted, \" It is a safe way of working, it is a cost -effective way of working. We, as a project we embrace it a lot, we kind of have a bias because we sp eak and work more with adolescence and young people and they are the largest digital users. So, we see quite a lot of positive in working with digital platforms.\" Reach Reach was also mentioned (n=5). While some KIs referred specifically to the total numb er of beneficiaries that the campaigns can reach, others noted that geo -targeting ensures the correct beneficiaries see the campaigns. One KI noted that when beneficiaries engage with the campaigns, they feel more comfortable disclosing information in this digital space. As this KJI noted, \" People are going to express things that they aren't going to say in school setting or church setting, or with a lot of people together. I think you get far more insights that are really interesting, even if it's pro or c ontra MSF or needs or worries, you get far more information if you do it than other kinds of way.\" Other One KI expressed the need for MSF to stay current in contemporary society, noting, \"I also think there is a factor that you can reach a lot of people and cost less money. There is this new generation, that maybe prefers being contacted this way. Maybe it is easier for them to go and message someone through a virtual interface.\" MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 29(62) Table 6.

Overall, KIs agreed that DHP impacts MSF as an organization by creating visibility through the campaigns (see Table 7) . While KIs recognized that this is not the objective of the Covid -19 campaigns, they found that they do increase MSF's visibility. As one KI noted, \"I mean even like as MSF, I think like in some contexts where we are maybe not known well, in new contexts, especially when you arrive in an d are not known well, where MSF is not present and not known, it's interesting also to be able to talk about MS F online, and it's a really good also way to promote the organizations as itself, so this can be also, be used to share prin ciples that we have on the impartiality and with all the values we have and can also permit us to have good access. I think it can be an interesting tool for MSF as an organization.\" Some KIs also felt that DHP helps MSF adapt to contemporary trends (n=4) , while others indicated that DHP would and should be expanded across the organization because it adds value to the organization MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 30(62) overall (n=3). However, a couple of KIs have their doubts about the how the current model can be incorporated into MSF operatio ns based on budget constraints of field teams as well as limited HR capabilities of the DHPU. Table 7. Long -term impacts of digital health promotion campaigns EQ6: WHAT ARE THE LONG -TERM IMPACTS OF DIGITAL HEALTH PROMOTION CAMPAIGNS WITHIN MSF AS AN ORGANIZATION?

From the perspective of KIs (n= 12), beneficiaries build trust in MSF through the DHP Covid -19 campaigns (n=8) . They can also access support (n=5), including emotion support and referrals. Some KIs spoke about the way that DHP can empower individuals (n=4) to ask qu estions they might not normally ask when surrounded by other people in a typical HP setting (e.g., schools and churches). Some (n=4) also recognized that there is no formal assessment process and there is really no way to know what the impacts on beneficia ries are. Finally, a couple of KIs also recognized that beneficiaries may become more aware of MSF as an organization. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 31(62) CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS Ninety -five per cent of the global population (more than 7 billion people) live in regions with cellul ar network coverage, and in developing countries, almost 41 per cent of people have mobile broadband subscription s.3 Prominent health -centred organizations, including MSF, have used DHP to reach diverse groups of beneficiaries worldwide .45 Since DHP is relatively new,46 standards for evaluation are still being developed. This evaluation applied the RE -AIM framework, which has been widely used to assess HP programs,47 and increas ingly DHP campaigns .48 The five RE -AIM criteria were used to answer the evaluation questions, and include d: reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. The objectives of this evaluation were twofold; 1) t o determine how successful the DHP campaigns in the sample (n=10) have been by identifying good practices and identifying areas of improvement and 2) to co - create recommendations with key stakeholders from/for the Digital Health Promotion Unit, Health Promotion referent, and Medical Directors. Overall, it was difficult to determine the success of the DHP campaigns due to lack of ME data. Howeve r, good practices and areas of improvement were easily identified. From the perspective of the field personnel, the most important factor that contributed to successful campaigns was the support they received from the DHPU, including training, technical su pport throughout implementation, and the consistent communication between the DHPU and field teams. The DHPU also provided guidance documents to support monitoring, technical training , and troubleshooting during implementation . The results of the evaluati on show that the most common areas for improvement include: Monitoring and Evaluation (ME) Operations Relationships with local stakeholders Adapting to local context Language 45 World Health Organizat ion. 2021.

According to MSF -OCB, \"the sole purpose of digital HP, as part of the general HP objective is to improve well -being of our target population.\"49 However, poorly de fined baseline data and lack of data on beneficiaries make this objective impossible to measure . OPERATIONS The evaluation found that operations surrounding DHP can be strengthened in numerous ways, specifically regarding HR, costs, and technical aspects. The role of the DHP field staff was poorly defined, and it was often unclear where the responsibilities of c ommunications ended and where DHP began within field teams. Some KIs also noted that the campaigns are cost effective overall based on the number of people they can reach in a short amount of time . However, they also indicated that if the field teams had t o carry the financial burden of the campaigns alone that they would not be able to reach as many people. FB paid for almost all the DHP campaigns to -date (except 3) as part of their global initiative to help end the pandemic. Technical aspects were also a concern . While field teams reported increased digital literacy as a direct result of training provided by the DHPU, they also noted that this may not work in some settings and that not all members of the DHP field teams received training directly f rom DHPU , which is something that some KIs (n=2) felt would help their DHP teams with implementation . RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS Some KIs also noted that campaigns should do a better job of aligning themselves with local stakeholders. This includes ensuring that campaign messages are congruent with messages from other organizations, such as the local Ministry of Health , as well as collaborating with stakeholders. In one case, there were campaign delays due to tense relationships with local h ealth authorities. ADAPTING TO LOCAL CONTEXT KIs also mentioned that the campaigns could be better adapted to local contexts. In some cases , KIs (n=2) mentioned that expanding campaign languages would have been beneficial. In other cases, KIs mentioned that the changing context of Covid -19 required that continuous research be conducted by members of the field team, which can put a strain on HR. This was necessary to ensure that campaign messages were up to date with the latest evidence -based practices sur rounding Covid -19. 49 Digital Health Promotion, 2021. MSF -OCB, Sherlog. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 33(62) LANGUAGE Not only did some KIs note that campaign should provide messaging in other languages, but some KIs noted that DHPU training and guidance documents should be provided in the languages of the field teams. This would ensure that everyone on the field team can participate in trainings and utilize the DHP resources provided by the DHPU. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS To address the second objective of the evaluation, the evaluator led a participatory workshop to co -create practical recommen dations based on the evaluation results. Participants included the evaluator, members of the SEU, and the commissioners of the evaluation. The recommendations below were identified . Overall, the recommendations identified during the participatory workshop provide practical examples of how to strengthen MSF's DHP initiatives. While the evaluation identified many gaps that need to be filled in order to determine the success o f the programs, it is clear from the desk review (see Annex 13) and semi -structured interviews, that DHP is part of a broader global trend towards digitization of health services and HP. As such, efforts to strengthen DHP activities should be integrated in to MSFs HP strategy. To address the second objective of the evaluation, the evaluator led a participatory workshop to co -create practical recommendations based on the evaluation results. Participants included the evaluator, members of the SEU, and the commissioners of the evaluation. The following recommendations were identified: 1. Develop transversal collaborations within MSF to create a more robust monitoring and evaluation (ME) system for digital health promotion (DHP) a. Draw on existing resources to develop and implement ME tools b. Strengthen relationships between the DHPU, SEU, MSF -OCB, and MSF to develop an ME framework c. Formalize the roles of the DHP field teams within MSF as an organization 2. Enhance the existing strengths of the DHPU by expanding HR a. Offer more technical training and support to field teams, which could include a training of trainer's program b. Add an additional member of DHPU to manage ME framework 3. Increasing continuity between health promotion (HP) and DHP a. Increase accessibility to DHP resources within the HP context b. Create more internal awareness about HP and DHP fram eworks, guidance documents, and resources Overall, the recommendations identified during the participatory workshop provide practical examples of how to strengthen MSF's DHP initiatives. While the evaluation identified many gaps that need to be filled in order to determine the success of the progr ams, it is clear from the desk review (see Annex 13) and semi -structured interviews, that DHP is part of a broader global trend towards digitization of health services and HP. As such, efforts to strengthen DHP activities should be integrated into MSFs HP strategy.

The Stockholm Evaluation Unit (SEU), based in Swede n, is one of three MSF units tasked to man age and guide evaluations of MSF's operational projects. For more information see: evaluation.msf.org . MEDICAL its Operati onal Centre in Brussels (OCB) began using digital health promotion in 2018 to complement its existin g health promotion strategies. The initial trials in Southern Africa proved to be promising and the experienc e provided a value opportun ity to learn and refin e the Digital H ealth Promotion Strategy. Befo re ther e was an opportunity to absorb the experience from Southern A frica and fully develop the Digital Health Promotion Strate gy, Covid-19 began to change the operati onal environment. The emergen ce of the novel virus at the beginning of 2020 saw an escalation of the number of countries in which MSF had emergency operati ons, including in several contexts that MSF had little or no experienc e working before. These operati ons had significant health promotion components and MSF needed to reach people quickly and provide health -related information. Many of the new contexts had the potential for use of social media that is not always the case in the contexts MSF works. At the same time the novel virus introduced significant limitations in terms of person-to-person contact, a SUBJECT/MI SSION: DIGITAL HEALT H PROMOTION - COVID-19 Starting date: 1st July, 2021 Duration: Final report to be submitted by latest August 29th, 2021 Requirements: Interested applicants should submit: 1) A proposal describing how to carry out this evaluation (including budget in a se parate file), 2) a CV, and 3) a written sample from previous work Deadline to apply: 2359hr s CEST on June 27th, 2021 Send application to: evaluations@stockholm.msf.org Note: Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic it is anticipated that this evaluation will not involve international travel and will require elements of remote data collection. MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 36(62) DIGHP Terms of Reference June 1, 2021 2(5) willingness from teams to try non-contact approaches. Based on these needs and the positive early pilot projects, MSF chose to significantly upscale its Digital Health Promotion activities in response to Covid-19 and ultimately established a small team at Head Quarters level to provide support to the field teams. One year on and MSF OCB has implemented numerous campaigns. During 2020 there were 631 campaigns in total and were managed in two groups. The first group, 49 small or 'low coverage' campaigns carried out autonomously by the teams in Sothern Africa who had conducted the original pilot projects and had the local capacity to operate autonomously. The second group includes larger 'high coverage' campaigns in relation to Covid-19 and carried out by field teams with support of the newly established Digital Health Promotion Unit. This group includes 14 campaigns during 2020 and an additional seven during 2021, running between June 1, 2020, and June 1, 2021. These campaigns were designed and implemented by Health Promotion staff in the project locations with support from the Digital Health Promotion Unit and various technical referents including Health Promotion, hygiene, sexual health, vaccination, etc. Each campaign aims to be tailored to the local environment and the project objectives and Health Promotion strategy and utilize different social media platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp. PURPOSE This evaluation provides an opportunity to reflect transversally on the experience of implementing digital health promotion in a variety of contexts and capitalising on this experience by identifying what works, why, for who, and under what circumstances. INTENDED USE This evaluation is intended to determine how successful the DHP campaigns have been in order to identify examples of good practice and areas of improvement. Based upon the evaluation questions and findings, the evaluators should lead a process of co-creating recommendations which can be used by the Digital Health Promotion Unit and Health Promotion referent and Medical Director to make adaptations at the implementation and strategic level. EVALUATION QUESTIONS The following evaluation questions (EQs) are indicative and can be elaborated during the proposal and inception phase of the evaluation in collaboration with the stakeholders. EQ1: How well did DHP address the most important needs? Was it the right solution in all cases? 1 Medical Activity Report MSF OCB Covid -19 Digital Health Promotion by Stockholm Evaluation Unit 37(62) DIGHP Terms of Reference June 1, 2021 3(5) EQ2: How well designed and implemented were the various campaigns?

RE-AIM Approach DIMENSION DEFINITION Reach The absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of individuals who are willing to participate in a given initiative, intervention, or program, and reasons why or why not. Effectiveness The impact of an intervention on important individual outcomes, including potential negative effects, and broader impact including quality of life and economic outcomes; and variability across subgroups (generalizability or heterogeneity of effects). Implementation At the setting level, implementation refers to the intervention agents' fidelity to the various elements of an intervention's key functions or components, including consistency of delivery as intended and the time and cost of the intervention. Importantly, it also includes adaptations made to interventions and implementation strategies. Adoption (Setting levels) The absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of settings and intervention agents (people who deliver the program) who are willing to initiate a program, and why. Note - adoption can have many (nested) levels - e.g. staff under a supervisor under a clinic or school, under a system, un der a community. Maintenance At the setting level, the extent to which a program or policy becomes institutionalized or part of the routine organizational practices and policies. Within the RE -AIM framework, maintenance also applies at the individual leve l. At the individual level, maintenance has been defined as the long -term effects of a program on outcomes after a program is completed. The specific time frame for assessment of maintenance or sustainment varies across projects.

FB Data li mitations FACEBOOK DATA LIMITATIONS60 Concept Definition Limitation Reach The number of people who saw your ads at least once. This may be based on sampled data, due to the way that FB calculates metrics. Because of this, the total reach for specific ad -sets may not add up to the total reach reported for the campaign overall. FB de -duplica tes overall campaign reach from individual ad -sets, which may target specific sub -populations. Therefore, the total reach for specific ad -sets may not add up to the total reach reported. Totals are sampled separately from breakdowns. Frequency The average number of times each person saw your ad. Calculated using sampled data (impressions divided by reach) (see above for explanation regarding this limitation). Ad fatigue may impact performance by exploring frequency in relation to reach over time. H owever, it's unclear what impact this has on beneficiaries or behavio ur change. Impressions The number of times your posts were on screen. Videos are not required to start playing to be counted as an impression.
