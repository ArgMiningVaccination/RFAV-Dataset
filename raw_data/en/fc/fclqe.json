Dewals1 Infection with parasitic helminths can imprint the immune system to modulate bystander inflammatory processes. Bystander or virtual memory CD8+T cells (T VM) are non- conventional T cells displaying memory properties that can be generated through respon-siveness to interleukin (IL)-4. However, it is not clear if helminth-induced type 2 immunityfunctionally affects the T VM compartment. Here, we show that helminths expand CD44hiCD62LhiCXCR3hiCD49dloTVMcells through direct IL-4 signaling in CD8+T cells. Importantly, helminth-mediated conditioning of T VMcells provided enhanced control of acute respiratory infection with the murid gammaherpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4). This enhanced controlof MuHV-4 infection could further be explained by an increase in antigen-speci c CD8 +T cell effector responses in the lung and was directly dependent on IL-4 signaling. These results demonstrate that IL-4 during helminth infection can non-speci cally condition CD8+T cells, leading to a subsequently raised antigen-speci c CD8+T cell activation that enhances control of viral infection.DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-06978-5 OPEN 1Immunology-Vaccinology, Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine -FARAH, University of Li\u00e8ge, Avenue de Cureghem 10, 4000 Li\u00e8ge, Belgium.2Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine and Division of Immunology, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa 7925.3Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.4Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, Institute of Infection, Immunity and In flammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8TA, UK.5Department Netherlands.6Scienti c Institute of Public Health, Immunology, Communicable and Infectious Diseases, Rue Engeland 642, 1180 Brussels, Belgium.7International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, 7925 Cape Town, South Africa.8South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), 7925 Cape Town, South Africa.9Institute of Microbiology and Infection, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT Birmingham, UK.10Laboratory of Molecular and Experimental Immunology UMR 7355, CNRS-University of Orleans and Institute for Advanced Studies, Rue Dupanloup, 45000 Orl\u00e9ans, France.

(email: bgdewals@uliege.be ) NATURE www.nature.com/naturecommunications 11234567890():,;Soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomes infect more than a quarter of the world population, essentially af flicting people who live in areas of poverty in the developing world1. Heavy parasite infections cause morbidity and mortality that can occur at levels high enough to delay socio-economic development2. Low-burden infections with helminths while mostly asymptomatic can still have bystander effects on other diseases, especially in the case of autoimmunity and allergy3,4, thus advocating the use of speci c helminths or derived products as therapeutic strategies while encouraging guided deworming campaigns5. However, how bystander helminth infections modulate the control of heterologous pathogens such as viruses is understood in only a limited number of contexts and reports of both bene cial and detrimental effects on viral pathology exist6-10. Memory establishment and maintenance is the hallmark of the adaptive immune system and essential for ultimate control of many pathogens. B and T lymphocytes are unique in their ability to acquire immune memory against speci c antigens (Ag) in order to provide these high levels of protection. However, these lymphocytes can also launch less stringent, but still effective responses to either antigen or host immune responses11,12. Fur- thermore, conditioning of T cells can impart memory-like properties and functions in absence of encounter of their cog- nate Ag13, and be important for priming CD4+T cells for sub- sequent type 2 immunity14. This is also the case for CD8+T cells; bystander or virtual memory CD8+T cells (T VM) emerge from early in life in naive mice15-18and humans19,20in the absence of specic Ag stimulation and are thus Ag-inexperienced. T VMcells have a memory-like phenotype with more effective responses to Ag encounter compared to na\u00efve cells and characterized by expression of high levels of CD44 and also CD62L but low levels of CD49d ( 4 integrin). T VMemerge in naive mice with an unrestricted TCR repertoire and in response to various stimuli including IL-15, IFN-I, and IL-413,20-22. While TCR involvement remains to be fully deciphered, recent data suggest that T VMare favored by stronger TCR signals against self-antigens but main-tain self-tolerance 13,21-24. Whereas T VMdevelopment in C57BL/6 mice mostly depends on IL-15, IL-4 is the main driver of T VM expansion in BALB/c mice25. Parasitic helminths induce type 2 immunity characterized by high levels of IL-426. Bystander consequences of this strong induction of IL-4 on memory CD8+T cells is not well under- stood in the context of helminth infection that also drive strong regulatory responses. In this study, we show that infection with mansoni Ags, expands bystander T VMcells in secondary lymphoid tissues via IL-4. This Ag-nonspeci c conditioning of CD8+T cells prior to encounter of their speci c Ag provides early and enhanced control of a subsequent gammaherpesvirus acute infection. This enhanced protection was the result of higher levels of virus- specic CD8+T cell effector responses. Thus, during helminth infection IL-4 can expand and condition T VMcells for more rapid CD8 responses against subsequent cognate Ag encounter. Results S. mansoni eggs induce T VMin peripheral lymphoid tissues .T o investigate how the T VMcellular compartment is affected by helminth-induced in flammation, we rst used a well- characterized experimental model for inducing type 2 in flam- mation by helminth Ags, in which eggs of the trematode parasite S. mansoni are injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to 6 -8-week-old female BALB/c mice before intravenous challenge (i.v.) 2 weeks later, and responses measured at d22 after the rst injection(Supplementary Figure 1a)27. We con rmed that S. mansoni eggs induced eosinophilic granulomas in the lung (Supplementary Figure 1b) and typical type 2 in flammation with high levels of soluble schistosome egg Ag (SEA)-speci c IgG1 (Supplementary Figure 1c) and IL-4 production upon SEA restimulation of the dLN (Supplementary Figure 1d). The CD8+T cell populations were initially compared from lung, dLN and spleen of BALB/c mice subjected to S. mansoni egg immunization or not and according to their expression of CD44, CD62L, and CD49d (Supplementary Figure 1b). S. mansoni - driven type 2 in flammation did not induce signi cant increase of lung or spleen cellularity while cell numbers in the dLN were increased (Fig. 1a). There was no overt response in the lung, despite increased true memory CD44hiCD49dhiT cell (T TM) proportions (Fig. 1b-d). However, responses in dLN and spleen were signi cantly affected with strikingly increased numbers and proportions of CD44hiCD49dloT cells, corresponding to the T VM compartment. Increased levels of eomesodermin (Eomes) werealso found in T VMcells after S. mansoni egg immunization, whereas T VMretained low-expression levels of T-bet (Fig. 1e, f), a typical feature of T VMcells22. IL-4 directs the expansion of T VMafter helminth exposure .W e then investigated the implication of IL-4 responsiveness in the expansion of the T VMpool after S. mansoni egg immunization. We con rmed that treatment with IL-4 complexes (IL-4c) strik- ingly induced CD44hiCD49dloTVMcells28expressing high levels of Eomes (Fig. 2a, b). IL-4 drives the expansion of T VMcells expressing CXCR329. Thus, we further included CXCR3 surface expression in our analyses and observed that the main part ofCD44 hiCXCR3hicells expressed high levels of CD62L and that population expressed low levels of CD49d, corresponding to T VM cells (Fig. 2c). The expansion of CXCR3hiTVMcells was further observed after S. mansoni egg immunization restricted to i.p. injection (Supplementary Figure 2a) or immunization with SEA or the Th2-driving schistosome egg recombinant protein omega-1 (Supplementary Figure 2b). T VMexpansion and Eomes upregu- lation was also observed in mice at later time points after S. mansoni egg immunization (d29 and d43 after initial i.p.), sug- gesting that conditioning of T VMis long lasting (Supplementary Figure 2c). Furthermore, we also observed T VMexpansion during other helminth-driven IL-4 dominated responses such as natural infection with N. brasiliensis at day 10 pi (Supplementary Fig- ure 2d), and a signi cant T VMexpansion and Eomes upregulation could also be observed by day 35 pi (Supplementary Figure 2e). In addition, natural infection with H. polygyrus at day 15 pi (Sup- plementary Figure 2f, g), and S. mansoni at week 7 pi (Supple- mentary Figure 2h) also caused increased T VMcell responses. These results further indicated that IL-4-dominated responses to helminth Ags can drive a long-lasting expansion of T VMcells in peripheral lymphoid tissue. S. mansoni egg injection to Il4ra/BALB/c mice did not result in the expansion of T VMcells (Fig. 2d) and unbiased restimulation of splenocytes with acetate and ionomycin resulted in increased IFN- production by CD8+T cells that was dependent on IL-4 receptor expression (Fig. 2e). We further sought to determine whether T VMexpansion was directly dependent upon IL-4 responsiveness of CD8+ T cells. Mixed chimeras were generated with congenically distinctBM from WT or Il4ra /BALB/c mice and subjected to S. mansoni egg immunization (Fig. 2f) or S. mansoni natural infection (Supplementary Figure 2i). Similar chimerism was observed in both S. mansoni egg- or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated mice.

However, CXCR3hiCD49- dloTVMcells of the Il4ra/genotype were signi cantly reduced in naive mice compared to WT compartment and did not expandafter helminth exposure. These results demonstrated that IL-4 responsiveness of CD8 +T cells conditions and expands T VMcells after S. mansoni egg immunization or natural infection. Next, in order to examine whether IL-4-dependent T VM expansion would not also result from an Ag-speci c response to S. mansoni eggs, a tetramer-based enrichment was performed on an unrelated and randomly chosen population of CD8+T cells expressing a TCR speci c to the H-2Kd-restricted yoelii (Supplementary Figure 2j). We observed that exposure to S. mansoni eggs also caused increased proportions of CD44hiCXCR3hiCSP280 -288-speci c CD8+T cells (Fig. 2g). These results further support that expansion of T VMinduced by helminth exposure is Ag-nonspeci c. Helminths ameliorate of MuHV-4 infection . Ag- inexperienced T VMcells respond more quickly to their cognate Ag than naive T cells30and IL-4 signaling in memory CD8+ T cells were previously suggested to reduce effector responses28. Thus, we investigated whether expanding the T VMpool through helminth exposure would affect effector CD8+T cell responses heterologous Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) is a gammaherpesvirus that infects the laboratory mouse and establishes long term persis- tence31. Interestingly, levels of primary MuHV-4 lytic infection are directly dependent on effective development of effector CD8+ T cells32. MuHV-4 was therefore used to assess virus-speci c CD8+T cell responses after exposure to helminth Ags. We rst immunized 8-week-old female BALB/c mice with S. mansoni eggs before their infection with 1 \u00d7 104plaque-forming units (PFU) of MuHV-4 intranasally under general anesthesia (Fig. 3a). A control group consisted of PBS-treated mice. Immunization with S. mansoni eggs protected against transient weight loss caused by MuHV-4 respiratory infection (Fig. 3b) and was associated with reduced levels of infection at day 7 postviral infection (pvi) as determined by immunostaining on lung tissue (Fig. 3c) and plaque assay (Fig. 3e). We next measured the levels of infection over time using MuHV-4-luc recombinant virus for live imaging of light emission centered on the thorax at days 2, 5, 7, and 9 pvi33.S. mansoni egg treatment resulted in signi cantly reduced levels of light emission by d7 pvi (Fig. 3d). There was a similar early control of respiratory MuHV-4 infection when BALB/c mice were infected 49 days after percutaneous exposure to S. mansoni cercariae, a time point corresponding to the peak of the response against the parasite eggs (Supplementary Figure 3a), whereas enhanced control of viral infection was not apparent when mice were coinfected at earlier time points of the parasite life cycle. Likewise, enhanced control of viral infection was also observed when mice were infected with MuHV-4 at d6 or d35 after infection with N. brasiliensis (Supplementary Figure 3b and c). Colonization of the host by MuHV-4 after lytic respiratory infection was not signi cantly affected by prior exposure to S. mansoni eggs as attested by live imaging of light emission centered on the super cial cervical LN (scLN, Fig. 3f) and qPCR for viral genome detection in the spleen at days 5, 7, 11, and 20 pvi (Fig. 3g). These observations further supported a role of CD8- dependent viral control during lytic replication as effective MuHV-4-speci c CD8+T cell responses were shown to be unable to control the establishment of viral latency34. We further observed that increasing MuHV-4 infectious dose resulted in enhanced control (Fig. 3h) and daily imaging of mice infectedwith 1 \u00d7 104PFU showed similar infection levels up to days 5 -6 pvi before being controlled in S. mansoni -exposed mice (Fig. 3i), suggesting enhanced adaptive immune responses rather than impaired viral growth. Helminths augment lung CD8+T cell responses to MuHV-4 . We next assessed the immune response against MuHV-4 in BALB/c mice that were exposed to S. mansoni eggs or not. We observed no signi cant difference in the antibody responses against MuHV-4 (Supplementary Figure 4a) and global cellularity in lungs at day 7 pvi was not affected (Supplementary Figure 4b). Whereas eosinophils and DC numbers were signi cantly increased in mice exposed to S. mansoni eggs, numbers of neu- trophils, macrophages, monocytes, B or CD4+T cells were not affected (Supplementary Figure 4b). Strikingly, the frequency and number of lung CD8+T cells was signi cantly increased at day 7 pvi in mice immunized with S. mansoni eggs (Fig. 4a-c) and mice infected percutaneously with S. mansoni cercariae 7 weeks before MuHV-4 infection (Fig. 4d). Such enhanced CD8+T cell response was associated with increased proportions of CD44hiCD62Lloeffector T cells (Fig. 4e). We further observed that effector CD44hiCD62LloCD49dhiCD8+T cell responses were transiently but signi cantly increased day 7 pvi in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs of mice prior exposed to S. mansoni eggs (Fig. 4f), as well as short-lived effector T cells (KLRG1+CD127) (Fig. 4g). These results suggest that prior exposure to helminths enhances CD8+T cell responses after MuHV-4 infection. Enhanced virus-speci c CD8 response after helminth exposure . We further sought to evaluate the effector role of CD8+T cell responses against MuHV-4 infection in BALB/c mice afterexposure to S. mansoni eggs. Interferon (IFN)- and granzyme B (GzmB) expression levels in BAL were signi cantly increased by day 7 pvi (Fig. 5a) and unbiased restimulation of lung cells with PMA and ionomycin caused signi cantly increased co- +T cells (Supplemen- tary Figure b). In order to assess the MuHV-4-speci c CD8+T cell response, we took advantage of H-2bcongenic BALB/B mice in which the sured35. We initially measured thoracic light emission after MuHV-4-luc infection of BALB/B mice and observed similar enhanced control of viral infection at day 7 pvi (Fig. 5b). Strikingly, tetramer staining (Fig. 5c, signi cantly increased MuHV-4-speci c responses in the BALF and lung in BALB/B mice that were initially exposed to S. mansoni eggs. Similar increased MuHV-4- specic responses by day 7 pvi were observed when mice where infected at day 29 or 43 after the initial i.p. injection of S. mansoni eggs (Supplementary Figure 5c). Moreover, infection of BALB/B mice with 1 \u00d7 104PFU of MuHV-4 intranasally after their initial infection with N. brasiliensis resulted in higher MuHV-4-speci c CD8+T cell responses at day 7 pvi (Supplementary Figure 5d -h). The results in Fig. 2e showed that S. mansoni eggs induced expansion of T VMcells expressing a TCR able to recognize MHC tetramers presenting the P. yoelii CSP280 -288peptide, absent from S. mansoni Ags. In order to examine the development of effector Ag- specic responses from CSP280 -288-speci cC we infected BALB/c mice with a MuHV-4-luc-CSP virus expressing a modi ed luciferase protein in which the H-2Kd-restricted CSP280-288 peptide was inserted in-frame (Supplementary Figure 5i).

To further investigate whether the enhanced Ag-speci c CD8+ T cell response against MuHV-4 was responsible for the early viral control observed in mice treated with S. mansoni eggs, mice were treated with depleting antibodies against CD8 or CD4 one day before MuHV-4 infection and then at days 1 and 4 pvi (Fig. 5h). While depletion of CD4 did not inhibit the early control of MuHV-4 infection observed in mice exposed to S. mansoni eggs, the absence of CD8+cells resulted in the total loss of such early control. These results demonstrate a CD8-dependentmechanism of enhanced control of viral infection and strongly suggest that S. mansoni egg immunization rendered CD8+T cell responses more ef cient clear MuHV-4 infection, dently of CD4+T cells. Helminth exposure affects the gene-expression pro le of T VM. To further investigate T VMphenotypic changes after exposure to S. mansoni eggs, we compared gene-expression pro les between PBS- or S. mansoni egg-treated T VMcells by RNA sequencing of FACsorted T VMcells from the spleen (Supplementary Figure 6).

These data demonstrate that naive or S. mansoni egg-induced T VMcells are phenotypically distinct and further suggest that this memory T cell population has enhanced capacity to initiate an antiviral response. Besides affecting their transcriptomics phenotype, exposure to Sm eggs leads to T VM expansion that could be due to IL-4 provoking their proliferation.However, EdU incorporation in vivo after S. mansoni egg immunization did not show overt proliferation in T VMcells, but did so in T TMcells after a single EdU administration 4 h before harvest (Fig. 6e). After a single injection of S. mansoni eggs, we observed that levels of IL-4 response to SEA increased by day 4 after injection associated with the expansion of T VMcells (Fig. 6f). However, only T TMcells showed signi cant proliferation and EdU incorporation over time after S. mansoni egg injection remained low in T Nand T VM(Fig. 6g). T VMexpansion could also result from a recruitment to the secondary lymphoid organs. To address this hypothesis, we treated mice with the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor signaling FTY720 to inhibit recruitment of lymphocytes to the spleen. FTY720 treatment did not impair the IL-4-dependent expansion of T VMin the spleen (Fig. 6h), although the extent of the expansion was slightly affected by inhibition of lymphocyte traf cking. In addition, bulk CD8+T lymphocytes isolated from the spleen of naive mice were trans- ferred to congenic naive BALB/c mice before immunization with S. mansoni eggs. T VMexpansion occurred irrespective of their donor or recipient origin (Fig. 6i), further suggesting that helminth-induced T VMexpansion can occur in peripheral CD8+ T lymphocytes. Thus, these results suggest that the observed T VM expansion likely result from the conversion from naive T cellsrather than proliferation or recruitment of T VMcells. IL-4 signals in CD8+T cells for early control of MuHV-4 . Next, we investigated the role of IL-4 responsiveness in the early control mediated by CD8+T cells after exposure to helminth Ags. We rst used S. mansoni eggs to immunize WT or Il4ra/BALB/c mice before subjecting them to intranasal MuHV-4 infection (Fig. 7a).Il4ra/mice did not display the enhanced control of MuHV-4 infection observed in WT mice, with Il4ra/mice exposed to S. mansoni eggs displaying similar to higher thoracic light signals. The lack of helminth-mediated early control of MuHV-4 infection in Il4ra/mice was further associated with the absence of increased CD8+T cells in the lung at day 7 pvi (Fig. 7b). These results suggest that IL-4 signaling during helminth-elicited in flammation governs the early capacity of BALB/c mice to generate effector CD8+T cells and control viral infection. To examine whether the presence of S. mansoni eggs in the pulmonary niche conditions the early control of MuHV-4 infection after exposure to helminth Ag, we injected S. mansoni eggs to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice twice via the i.p. route at 2 weeks interval before MuHV-4-luc infection intranasally at day 22 (Supplementary Figure 7a). We found that the presence of S. mansoni eggs in the lung was dispensable for the early control of viral infection, with signi cantly reduced light emission signals by day 7 pvi. In addition, treatment with IL-4c at 2 days interval before MuHV-4-luc infection intranasally at day 4 reduced thelevels of light emission reporting infection (Fig. 7c), which was associated with enhanced effector CD8+T cell responses in the lung after MuHV-4 infection (Fig. 7d, e). These results further suggest the role of IL-4-induced T VMcells in contributing to the early effector CD8+T cell responses against MuHV-4 infection. The impact of IL-4 sensitivity of CD8+T cells after immunization with S. mansoni eggs on subsequent responses against MuHV-4 infection was further investigated by co-transfer of T VM-rich WT and T VM-poor Il4ra/puried CD8+T cells from PBS orS. mansoni egg-treated mice cells in equivalent numbers to congenic PBS orS. mansoni egg-treated BALB/c mice (Supplementary Figure 7b). Mice were then infected or not with MuHV-4. The absolute numbers of donor WT and Il4ra/ CD8+T cells localizing to the lung tended to increase at 7 day pvi (Fig. 7f), and analysis of WT: Il4ra/donor cell ratios normal- ized to uninfected mice demonstrated signi cant enrichment of donor WT CD8+T cells compared to donor Il4ra/CD8+ T cells when the mice were initially treated with S. mansoni eggs (Fig. 7g). Importantly, IL-4 signaling in CD8+T cells resulted in signicantly increased IFN- production after unbiased restimu- lation of lung cells from S. mansoni egg-treated mice after MuHV-4 infection, compared to the donor Il4ra/CD8+T cell compartment (Fig. 7h). These results demonstrated that IL-4 signaling in CD8+T cells, probably through expansion of T VM cells, contributes signi cantly to condition effective antiviral CD8+ T cell responses and that IL-4R -dependent S. mansoni egg- induced in flammation in the lung environment alone is not sufcient to signi cantly enhance CD8+T cell responses. Nonetheless, it was unclear whether S. mansoni egg-induced TVMcells could outcompete their naive counterparts. Thus, T VMcells FACsorted from PBS andS. mansoni egg-treated mice cells in equivalent numbers to congenic naive BALB/c mice. At day 7 after MuHV-4 infection, effector T cells originating from transferred T VMcells could be detected in lungs and BALF demonstrating the contribution of T VMcells to the effector antiviral CD8 response (Fig. 7i). However, no signicant differences could be observed between naive or Sm egg-induced T VM compartments (Fig. 7j). Thus, although phenotypically distinct to naive T VMcells, preliminary expansion of T VMcells contributes to the early control of MuHV-4 infection. Discussion IL-4 and IFN- are usually considered antagonistic as hallmark cytokines of type 2 and type 1 immunity, respectively. None- theless, IL-4 can drive Eomes expression in CD8+T cells and lead to IFN- production23,37. We con rm here that this intriguing mechanism has functional consequences in vivo by providing evidence that IL-4 induced by helminths can have under certain circumstances, bene cial bystander consequences on IFN- - dependent antiviral effector responses through induction of TVMexpansion. Immunity against helminths could therefore have evolved a safety mechanism through induction of highly responding T VMcells to counterbalance negative effects of type 2 immunity on the development of effective antiviral responses. Helminth infections are highly prevalent and have been shown to modulate the immune system, sometimes leaving a long-lasting imprint on the ability of the helminth-exposed hosts to respond to heterologous Ags. Indeed, helminth infections can down- modulate allergy or in flammatory bowel disease through various mechanisms38, but have also been involved in modulating the ability of the infected host to control virus infections. Several groups have shown using C57BL/6 mice that exposure to H. polygyrus orS. mansoni eggs enhanced reactivation from latency of MuHV-4 through changes in the IL-4/IFN- balance10and also that intestine dwelling helminths could alter effector CD8+TARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-06978-5 10 NATURE MuHV-4Time after infection (days) Time after infection (days) Time after infection (days)0123456789 10 0123456789 1 0**** ** ** **** * *** * * *** 01020304050 01020304050 0510152025 cells 5.00.01.5CD8+ (% of 012 1.5 0.5Lung CD8+ T 104) WT / Il4ra-/- IFN- + (% of donor CD8+)Il4ra/ cells TVM ratio (log2)ab cd e fg h i j Fig. 7 Helminth-induced IL-4 conditions CD8+T cells for early control of MuHV-4 infection.

Nevertheless, these studies did not investigate how helminths could affect bystander memory T cells such as the T VMcom- partment. Indeed, although T VMdevelopment can be highly dependent on IL-4 direct signaling in CD8+T cells22,25, little was known on the ability of this cytokine to drive the expansion of TVMin settings dominated by type 2 immunity such as exposure to helminths. BALB/c mice provide an important opportunity to investigate sensitivity to IL-4 of CD8+T cells after egress from the thymus as this strain show a particular sensitivity to IL-4 for driving T VMdevelopment25. This aspect is of great importance as disregarding IL-4-responsive T VMcells could thwart the full understanding of the mechanism involved and how helminths can affect bystander memory T cells such as T VMcells. Our data reveal that exposure to helminths and derived products elicit Ag- nonspeci c expansion of the T VMcompartment through direct signaling of IL-4. Notably, we observed that such expansion was associated with Eomes upregulation in T VMcells with no altera- tion of T-bet expression levels, further characterizing these cells as IL-4-induced T VM17. Such conditioning was observed in sev- eral settings involving Th2-dominating responses such as immunization with helminth Ags or infection with systemic or intestinal helminths like S. mansoni ,N. brasiliensis ,o r H. poly- gyrus . These observations are important as they demonstrated that helminths could actually condition bystander memory CD8+ T cells to respond more effectively to their cognate Ags to thebenet of the infected host. Indeed, our ndings revealed that helminths induced Ag- nonspeci c expansion of bystander T VMcells in secondary lym- phoid organs via direct sensitivity to IL-4 that resulted in increased Ag-speci c effector CD8+T cell responses in the lungs of BALB/c mice to further enhance the control of MuHV-4 lytic replication. These data are supported by previous reports showing that IL-4R deciency compromises the Ag-speci c CD8+T cell response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or in fluenza virus infections whereas the ability of effector IL-4R -decient CD8+ T cells to kill was unaffected22,40. Thus, the inability of Il4ra/ mice for early control of MuHV-4 after S. mansoni egg exposure lies in the ineffective development of T VMcells and absence of IL- 4 responsiveness of CD8+T cells in these mice. Although IL-4 signaling in memory T cells was previously associated with downregulation of NKG2D expression and impaired killing capabilities28, we did not observe signi cant modulation of NKG2D mRNA expression levels after S. mansoni egg treatment in our experimental settings and we observed increased CD8+ antiviral effector responses in the lung. Our transcriptomics datarather indicated that S. mansoni egg-induced T VMwere pheno- typically distinct from naive T VMcells with increased IFN- and IFN-gene signatures. Nonetheless, their ability to react against their cognate Ag and migrate to the infected lungs was not sig- nicantly different to naive T VMin a competitive adoptive transfer in naive congenic mice. These observations suggest that both expansion of the T VMcompartment after exposure to hel- minths and alterations of their phenotype can explain the early response to MuHV-4 Ags and subsequent early control. In addition, the low-proliferation levels in the T VMpopulation after exposure to S. mansoni eggs together with the observation that FTY720 did not inhibit T VMexpansion in the spleen after IL-4c treatment and T VMexpansion in adoptively transferred congenic CD8+T lymphocytes suggested that the expansion is likely due to conversion from naive CD44loT cells while independent of proliferation or recruitment to the spleen. As a consequence, expansion of the T VMpool is likely associated with an enrichment of the TCR repertoire in this bystander memory population rather than the proliferation of pre-existing T VMcells, a phe- nomenon that could signi cantly augment the probability ofeffective Ag priming together with the ability of T VMcells to outcompete their naive CD44loT cell counterpart30. Whether T VMcells is also asso- ciated with MuHV-4-speci c true memory CD8+T cells after lytic infection remains unknown, but the establishment of effec- tive memory is rather suggested by a previous report demon- strating that establishment of effective memory against malaria requires IL-4R on CD8+T cells41. This could have important implication for improved vaccination strategies and should fur- ther encourage investigators to unravel how T VMcells can be effectively expanded in multiple settings with various types of Ags. Latency during gammaherpesvirus infections such as Kaposi Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or Epstein -Barr virus, is mainly responsible for malignancies such as lymphomas in human42,43,a phase during which virus-infected cells evade CD8+T cell recognition44. However, reactivation events of lytic replication occur and are believed to maintain suf cient levels of infection in the host as well as for transmission33. Thus, an effective memory T cell response to control these reactivation events is important. Understanding how helminth-driven expansion of TVMcells impact on long term virus-speci c memory is therefore essential. In conclusion, we provide evidence that helminth-driven type 2 immune responses drives T VMexpansion through IL-4 which could in turn positively condition effector Ag-speci c CD8+ T cells responses and signi cantly enhance the control of viral infection such as lytic gammaherpesvirus infections.

BALB/c Cd45.1+Cd45.2+were by crossing Cd45.1+ BALB/c mice with wild-type BALBc/OlaHsd (Cd45.2+).Il4ra/BALB/c mice were bred at the University of Li\u00e8ge, Department of Infectious Diseases. Six- to eight-week-old female littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups.During experiences, four to ve female mice were cohoused per cage, food and water was provided ad libitum. All the animals were bred and/or housed in the University of Li\u00e8ge, Department of Infectious Diseases. Mixed bone-marrow chimeric mice models . Mixed bone-marrow chimeric mice were produced by exposing CD45.1 +CD45.2+BALB/c mice to a whole body lethal irradiation protocol (Gammacell 40 Exactor, 4.5 Gy, two expositions at 3-h interval). The next day, mice were reconstituted by intravenous injection of 4.5 \u00d7 106BM cells isolated from femurs and tibias of donor CD45.1+WT and CD45.2+Il4ra/mice and mixed at a 1:1 ratio. From 1 week before to 3 weeks after irradiation, mice were given broad-spectrum antibiotherapy (0.27 g trimethoprimum and 1.33 of drinking water, Emdotrim 10%, Ecuphar). Mice were left untreated for 8 weeks to allow complete reconstitution and chimerism of the different blood leukocytes populations was then con rmed by flow cytometry. Helminth infections and immunization with helminth Ags . For natural infection with S. mansoni , mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 16 mg kg 1 of xylazine and 100 mg kg1of ketamine and infected by percutaneous exposure to 35 cercariae during 30 min. Treatment with S. mansoni eggs consisted of an intraperitoneal immunization on day 0 (5000 eggs per mouse) followed by oneintravenous injection of 5000 eggs on day 14. In some experiments, mice received S. mansoni eggs (5000 eggs per mouse), SEA (60 g per mouse) or recombinant -1 (10g per mouse) intraperitoneally at 2 weeks interval. Mice anesthetized by iso flurane inhalation were infected with N. brasiliensis by subcutaneous injection of 500 \u00d7 L3 larvae.

Mice were euthanized and spleen were processed as described above. Surface staining was performed with exception of PE-conjugated antibodies. After dead cells staining, cells were xed for 15 min at room temperature in Click-It Fixative (ThermoFisher Scienti c), washed with PBS/1%BSA in Click-It Saponine-Based meabilization Buffer (ThermoFisher Scienti sodium ascorbate with 1 mM THPTA (tris((1-hydroxy-propyl-1H-1,2,3-tria-zol-4-yl)methyl)amine) and 10 mM amino-guanidine in PBS] and incubated 2 h at RT 57. Cells were washed with Click-It Saponine-Based Permeabilization Buffer and incubated with PE-conjugated antibodies for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. Lung and BAL cells were processed as described above from BALB/B mice (H-2 Tetramer Core Facility), respectively, for 30 min at RT before further staining. Samples were analyzed on a BD (ICCS) metry or by ELISA on culture supernatants. For ICCS, cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2in IMDM complemented with 2 penicillin ml1, 100 mg streptomycin ml1and 10% FCS for 4 h in presence of brefeldin A (10 \u00b5g mL 1, eBioscience, Cat # 00-4506-51), M). Following sur- face and viability stainings, cells were xed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight and washed with Permeabilization Permeabilization Buffer for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. For ELISA, cells werecultured at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2in IMDM complemented with penicillin ml1, 100 mg streptomycin ml1and 10% FCS for 72 h with SEA (20 \u00b5g mL1). Supernatant were collected and conserved of cytokines IL-4 was performed using speci c ELISA (Ready-SET-Go, eBioscience) following manufacturer 's instructions. In vivo CD8+or CD4+cells depletion . For depletion experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally with anti-CD8 (clone YTS-169.4, 200 g per injection) or anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5, 200 g per injection) both obtained from BioXCell at day 1, 1 and 4 after MuHV-4-Luc infection. Depletion was con rmed by flow cytometry analysis of blood cells on day 6. T cell enrichment and competitive adoptive transfer . Spleen single-cell sus- pensions were obtained by forcing through a 70 m cell strainer (Falcon) before cell counts determined. CD8+T cells were then enriched using negative magnetic isolation (Miltenyi Biotec) and used either for adoptive transfer of bulk CD8+ T cells or for further T VMpurication: enriched CD8+T cells were then FACsorted to isolate CD44hiCXCR3hiCD62LhiCD49dloTVMcells to high purity (>97%) before further analysis or adoptive transfer. Competitive adoptive transfer of naive and Smegg-induced T VMcells consisted in the intravenous administration into WT naive BALB/c congenic recipients of equal numbers (4 \u00d7 106cells total) of naive and Sm egg-induced T VMcells. For competitive transfer of WT CD8+ T cells, equal or Sm egg-treated BALB/c WT BALB/c congenic recipients. RNA sequencing .TVMcells were extracted as described in the previous section before RNA extraction with on-column DNase treatment (RNeasy Plus mini kit, Qiagen). Integrity of extracted RNAs was controlled on a 2100 Agilent Bioanalyzer and samples with a RNA integrity number > 9 were processed for RNA sequencing.Libraries were prepared from 0.5 g of RNA of three independent replicates per group, using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA library preparation kit. Libraries were then sequenced and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Approximately30 million 75-base single-end reads were generated per sample. Quality control checks on raw sequencing data for each sample were performed using FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics). Reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome(mm10) using STAR (version 3.4.0) 58. Subsequently the analysis was performed with R Bioconductor packages:59Rsamtools (version 1.18.3) and GenomicAlign- ments (version 1.2.2) were used to count the reads by exons, and gene count datasets were then analyzed to determine DE genes (DEGs) using DESeq2 (version 1.16.1). A gene was determined to be a DEG by passing FDR < 0.1 and log 2-foldchange \u00b10.5. Statistical analysis . Statistical evaluation of different groups was performed either by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Dunnett or Sidak multiple- comparison test or by nonparametric Mann -Whitney test, as indicated. A Pvalue < 0.05 was considered signi cant. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism v6 (Graphpad, La Jolla, CA).
