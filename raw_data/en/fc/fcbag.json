What Is Vitamin C IV Therapy? We've designed our IV vitamin C treatment to help with cancer prevention and immunity. Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that cannot be produced by humans and requires supplementation. Vitamin C is essential for collagen production, immune system activation and response, metabolism support, and antioxidant protection. It also can prevent asthma, reduce inflammation, promote healthy adrenal gland function, lower blood pressure, and support healthy heart function. Research indicates that high doses of this vitamin through vitamin C infusion treatments are associated with reduced risks of death from cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Vitamin C is also vital to the body's healing process and can help defend the adverse effects of free radicals. Likewise, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12 serve as the building blocks of a healthy body and have a direct impact on energy levels, brain function, and cell metabolism. B vitamins help prevent infections and help promote cell health. Our vitamin C IV therapy formula also includes magnesium chloride. This naturally-occurring mineral is essential for body systems, particularly the muscles and nerves. This type of treatment also features calcium glucosamine, which reduces pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints, hips, and knees.
