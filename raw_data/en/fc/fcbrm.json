She is the recipient of the President's Award for the highest academic excellence of her graduating year and the Internship Award for her dedication in the TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) clinic. Healing is her passion, and she creatively combines TCM (including acupuncture, gua sha and herbs) with other energy healing techniques, such as Reiki, muscle testing, shamanic, sound, and calligraphy healing. All her healings come from her heart and a deep connection to the Source. Winnie uses her body and her hands as a clear channel of universal healing energy. Before becoming a healer, Winnie earned dual bachelor of science degrees in Computer Science and Finance from MIT, a master of science degree in Integrated Marketing from NYU, and has worked on Wall Street and marketing consulting, and co-founded an experiential learning Chinese school in New York ( [www.mandarinseeds.com)](http://www.mandarinseeds.com). She is a balance between East and West, science and intuition, as well as practicality and compassion. Client Testimonials: \"Winnie Wang is an incredible acupuncturist and healer. She listens deeply and addresses issues on all levels; mental, physical and emotional. She has great attention to detail and also has the ability to go into an expansive, meditative space. I appreciate her passion, dedication and confidence in her work. I see her for regular acupuncture appointments and any acute conditions that come up. I'm so grateful for her healing touch and loving presence. I highly recommend her services!\" - Wahe Guru Kaur \"Winnie is an amazing healer! Due to my having migraines for the past 20+ years, I have had a lot of acupuncture in my life, mostly by seasoned practitioners. Winnie blends her spiritual wisdom with her acupuncture knowledge and skill to form a truly healing practice. She is extremely gentle and listens to your body, so even if you have been scared to try acupuncture, I would recommend everyone to give it a try. When I first saw Winnie, I felt fatigued all the time. Winnie prescribed some herbs, and after about a month, there was a substantial improvement in energy level. As busy as I am, I try to see her every week!\" - Marjo Garrison "}
