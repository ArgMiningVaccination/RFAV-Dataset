Cases reported in Hawaii include three non-residents diagnosed in Kauai county and two non-residents diagnosed in Honolulu county. About This Disease Mpox (monkeypox) is a contagious disease caused by the mpox virus. There is currently an outbreak of mpox in the U.S. and other countries where the virus is not usually seen. The current mpox situation is evolving quickly and is subject to change. While mpox infection is generally not lethal, people can experience severe outcomes. Most of these people have not been hospitalized and have recovered on their own. - Mpox can spread when a person comes into close, intimate contact with the virus from an infected person or materials contaminated with the virus. - Common symptoms: Flu-like symptoms; swelling of lymph nodes; rash or sores, often on the hands, feet, chest, face, or genitals. - Avoid skin-to-skin and prolonged close contact (touching sores, kissing, sex) with anyone who has an unusual rash or mpox symptoms. People exposed to mpox should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Options are available to prevent infection after high-risk close contact. Examples of mpox lesions Photo credit: CDC, UK Health Security Agency, World Health Organization Infection begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, chills, exhaustion and swollen lymph nodes. Infection progresses to a rash or sores, often on the hands, feet, chest, face, or genitals. Individuals generally become ill within 21 days of exposure. Get the facts about mpox [here](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/index.html). Infections generally last two to four weeks. Individuals are infectious until all lesions are scabbed over and new skin has grown. While most people diagnosed with mpox experience mild to moderate illness, the rash and sores can be itchy and painful. Treatment for mpox is available but must be coordinated through DOH and a physician. Transmission can occur through: - Direct, prolonged contact with body fluids, lesion material, or items used by someone with mpox. - Large respiratory droplets. These droplets are spread when people breathe, cough, sneeze, or talk. These droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required. - Close, prolonged contact with an infected person or animal. - Sharing a bed with someone who is infected or by sharing items like towels or unwashed clothing. - Having intimate contact with others, including during sex, kissing, cuddling, or touching parts of the body with mpox sores. At this time, it is not known if mpox can spread through semen or vaginal fluids. - Mpox has not been proven to spread through touching items like doorknobs or by walking past someone who is infected. Mpox is diagnosed through laboratory testing. DOH's State Laboratories Division and commercial labs can test for orthopoxvirus. Confirmatory testing for mpox must be performed by the CDC. Providers should refer to DOH's [August 1st medical advisory](https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/files/2022/08/Medical-Advisory-Diagnosis-Management-Prevention-of-Monkeypox-08012022.pdf) for more information on diagnosing mpox. Additional testing resources: Vaccination & Treatment JYNNEOS has been approved by the FDA for safe and effective mpox prevention in adults. JYNNEOS reduces one's chances of getting monkeypox and may reduce symptoms after becoming infected. However, no vaccine is 100% effective; therefore, it is important that individuals [reduce their risk of potential exposure](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/prevention.html) to mpox both before and after receiving a dose of JYNNEOS. Most people who get the JYNNEOS vaccine have minor reactions. These may include pain, redness, swelling, firmness, or itching where the shot was given, especially for intradermal injection (between layers of the skin). Some people have reported reactions lasting 2-4 weeks, or longer. You also may have muscle pain, headaches, nausea, chills, or may feel tired. There is a small chance of fever. As with any medicine, there is a very small chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction. If you have signs of a severe allergic reaction (such as hives, swelling of the face or throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness), call 911 immediately or go to the nearest hospital. For other concerns, contact a health care provider. - - Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the [VAERS website](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)or call 800-822-7967. VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice. - You can visit the [FDA website](https://www.fda.gov/media/131078/download)(PDF) to read the package insert for this vaccine. For more information on the vaccine, visit the [CDC JYNNEOS Vaccine Statement](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/smallpox-monkeypox.pdf)(PDF) and the [CDC's Consideration on Monkeypox Vaccine site](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/considerations-for-monkeypox-vaccination.html). - Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the DOH ordered its full allocation of the JYNNEOS vaccine from the federal government. As vaccine supplies are currently limited, DOH's mission is to protect those at increased risk of infection or severe disease. | | Current Eligibility for Mpox Vaccination Hawaii residents who: Parental consent is required for vaccination of individuals under 18 years of age. Workers in certain occupational groups are also eligible: Clinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for orthopoxviruses and research laboratory personnel who directly handle cultures or animals contaminated or infected with orthopoxviruses Vaccine Clinics - Oahu residents can contact: - Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center (in Waianae and Kapolei) at 808-427-0442 - Hawai'i Health & Harm Reduction Center (in Honolulu) at 808-521-2437 - Kaiser Permanente, Mapunapuna Medical Office (in Honolulu) at 808-432-2000 and prompt #1 (for members and non-members) - Waikiki Health at 808-922-4787 - Project Vision Hawaii, which offers walk-up vaccination at pop-up clinics.

However, anyone who has been in close contact with someone with mpox is at increased risk of infection, regardless of a person's gender, sexual orientation, or travel history. If you are at increased risk for mpox, you may want to [postpone having new casual sex partners and avoid events where you have close bodily contact with others](https://fenwayhealth.org/understanding-monkeypox-among-gay-and-bisexual-men/), at least during the current outbreak. If you have symptoms consistent with mpox or have an unusual rash or sores, avoid close contact with others. Contact your healthcare provider and let them know ahead of an appointment that you may have been exposed to mpox. Practice [proper hand hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) regularly. Washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds helps prevent the spread of disease, including mpox. While mpox infection is generally not lethal, people can experience severe outcomes. Treatment for mpox is available but must be coordinated through DOH and a physician.

Cleaning, Disinfecting and Laundry Avoid activities that could spread dried material from lesions (e.g., use of fans, dry dusting, sweeping, or vacuuming) in these areas. Perform disinfection using an EPA-registered disinfectant with an [Emerging Viral Pathogens](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/what-emerging-viral-pathogen-claim) claim, which may be found on EPA's [List Q](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/disinfectants-emerging-viral-pathogens-evps-list-q). Follow the manufacturer's directions for concentration, contact time, and care and handling. Linens can be laundered using regular detergent and warm water. Soiled laundry should be gently and promptly contained in a laundry bag and never be shaken or handled in a manner that may disperse infectious material. Covering mattresses in isolation areas (e.g. with sheets, blankets, or a plastic cover) can facilitate easier laundering. Isolation Isolate staff, volunteers, or students who have mpox away from congregate settings until they are fully recovered. Flexible, non-punitive sick leave policies for staff members are critical to prevent spread of mpox. Reduce the number of staff who are entering the isolation areas to staff who are essential to isolation area operations. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Cleaning and disinfection\u2014Staff, volunteers, or residents should wear a gown, gloves, eye protection, and a well-fitting mask or respirator when cleaning areas where people with mpox spent time. Laundry\u2014When handling dirty laundry from people with known or suspected mpox infection, staff, volunteers, or residents should wear a gown, gloves, eye protection, and a well-fitting mask or respirator. PPE is not necessary after the wash cycle is completed.
