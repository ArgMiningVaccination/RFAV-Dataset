Obesity is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer and other adverse pathological condi - tions2. Some of these comorbidities are considered as features of the commonly named metabolic syndrome3 \u2014 a prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (BOX 1 ). Increased fat deposition, according to a simplistic view based on the first law of thermodynamics, results from an imbalance between the caloric intake and energy expen diture. According to this view, obesity is the result of low physical activity (a sedentary lifestyle) and the over consumption of high-energy- yielding foods above the needs of the individual. However, in reality, the aetio- logy of obesity is more complex4. Indeed, circumstances such as socioeconomic status, environment and personal behaviours, and genotype-phenotype interactions have to be taken into account5 to understand obesity, as all these factors affect food intake, nutrient turnover, thermo- genesis, lipid utiliza tion of fatty acids away from storage and towards oxidation, and also differential fat storage in regional adipose depots versus non-adipose tissues. The control of body weight and composition has to con - sider energy intake, energy expenditure and fat deposition, which are interconnected and under an integral regu - lation by the neural and endocrine systems, where dif - ferent neuropeptides and hormones participate6. Several agents modify these regulatory processes: environ mental factors (for example, lack of sleep or shift work and ambi - ent temp eratures), overall diet quality, level of physical activity, the gut microbiota, endocrine disruptors (that is, chemicals that interfere with endocrine regulation), repro - ductive factors (such as greater fertility among people with higher adiposity and assortative mating (that is, mating between individuals with similar phenotypes)), drugs, and intrauterine and epigenetic intergenerational effects7. Another difficulty encountered in studying obesity is the marked heterogeneity of individuals with obesity. Examples of obesity types at both ends of the continuum are subcutaneous obesity, in which excess subcutaneous fat is found around the hip and thigh areas (pear-like body shape or gynoid obesity, which is more common in women), and visceral obesity, in which fat (mainly mesenteric adipose tissue) is mainly concentrated in the abdominal region (apple-like body shape or android obesity). Visceral obesity is more common in men and tends to be more pernicious in health terms, particularly affecting cardiovascular risk.Correspondence to J.A.M.

Alfredo Martinez1-3,11 Abstract | Excessive fat deposition in obesity has a multifactorial aetiology, but is widely considered the result of disequilibrium between energy intake and expenditure. Despite specific public health policies and individual treatment efforts to combat the obesity epidemic, >2 billion people worldwide are overweight or obese. The central nervous system circuitry, fuel turnover and metabolism as well as adipose tissue homeostasis are important to comprehend excessive weight gain and associated comorbidities. Obesity has a profound impact on quality of life, even in seemingly healthy individuals. Diet, physical activity or exercise and lifestyle changes are the cornerstones of obesity treatment, but medical treatment and bariatric surgery are becoming important. Family history, food environment, cultural preferences, adverse reactions to food, perinatal nutrition, previous or current diseases and physical activity patterns are relevant aspects for the health care professional to consider when treating the individual with obesity. Clinicians and other health care professionals are often ill-equipped to address the important environmental and socioeconomic drivers of the current obesity epidemic. Finally, understanding the epigenetic and genetic factors as well as metabolic pathways that take advantage of 'omics' technologies could play a very relevant part in combating obesity within a precision approach.

Even though the body mass index (BMI) is an imprecise tool, it is the most commonly used11. BMI grossly estimates adipo sity and identifies overweight and obesity based on the weight of the individual expressed in kilograms (kg) and divided by the square height in metres (m2). The WHO classification using BMI defines under nutrition as <18.5 kg/m2, normal weight as 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, overweight as 25-29.9 kg/m2, obesity as 30 kg/m2, 40 kg/m2 is considered extreme obesity12. Unless specifi- cally mentioned, this classification will be used through - out this Primer. BMI could be complemented by also measuring waist circumference to discriminate between subcutaneous obesity and visceral obesity13,14. As it has been shown that low hip fat (adjusted for height or waist circumference) may protect against diseases, the ratio of waist-to-hip circumferences and the waist-to-height ratio have also been proposed to refine risk assessment. However, for practical reasons, comparability and ease to measure weight and height, the BMI still prevails as the most used indicator of adiposity worldwide. Different approaches and treatments at the individ - ual level have been developed and prescribed: dietary education and control, physical activity programmes, pharmaco therapy and bariatric surgery. Bariatric sur - gery has been associated with metabolic improvements (including halting or reversing the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus) independent of weight loss, but adverse effects have also been reported15. At the present time, 39% of the world population is obese or overweight, despite decades of efforts to slow the progress of the epidemy16 (FIG. 1 ). This prevalence translates into a global health cost equivalent to 2.8% of the world's gross domestic product, or approximately US$2 trillion17. To halt the epidemic, individualized treatment strategies such as precision lifestyle modifica - tions should be complemented with wider population- based approaches and solutions, including prevention. Recently, several countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have started lines of research in this area. The research will involve genotype analysis of >1 million people, which will be compared with their phenotypes. In addition, public health strategies have been implemented, such as taxation to reduce unhealthy fats and added sugar consumption, and personalized precision nutrition approaches18,19. In this Primer, we discuss obesity and its association with pathophysiological abnormalities that increase health risk, such as features of the metabolic syndrome. Epidemiology Prevalence and trends According to the WHO, >2.1 billion adults were estim- ated to be overweight or obese globally in 2014 (REF. 16), of which 1.5 billion were overweight and 640 million were obese (FIG. 1 ). The estimated age-standardized prevalence (an epidemiological technique that is used to compare populations with different age profiles) of obesity in 2014 was 10.8% among adult men and 14.9% among adult women1,20,21. These data would indicate that female sex is associated with higher risk of obesity, whereas overweight is more prevalent among men1. However, the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 reported a similar prevalence of overweight and obesity between men and women, being >36% in both21. In studies conducted in the United States, African Americans exhibited a higher prevalence of extreme obesity than other ethnicities22. Asian populations have lower BMI values than white individuals, but they have been shown to be prone to visceral fat deposition, making Asian populations more susceptible to develop- ing type 2 diabetes mellitus at lower BMI levels than white individuals23. Between 1980 and 2008, the global age-standardized mean for BMI increased by 0.4 (in men) to 0.5 kg/m2 (in women) per decade24 (FIG. 2 ).The percentage of adults with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28.8% to 36.9%, and from 29.8% to 38% in men and women, respectively21. By 2030, estimates fore - cast that 57.8% (3.3 billion people) of the world adult population will have a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher25,26. As such, the obesity-associated burden of disease is expected to increase in coming years. In many countries and regions, not only the United States and Europe, the number of adults who are overweight or obese is greater than that for normal-weight adults1 (FIG. 1 ). The adverse health consequences of obesity represent greater threats for public health than hunger or malnutrition5. In 2013-2014, the worldwide number of children and adolescents (2-19 years of age) with obesity was estimated to be 110 million; this number has doubled since 1980. Furthermore, the estimated age-standardized prevalence of obesity in 2014 was 5% among children21,27.

Childhood obesity has been associated with metabolic complications and chronic disease in adulthood29. Metabolic imprinting Critical periods in the development of obesity exist in the prenatal period, infancy, childhood and adolescence (FIG. 3 ). Metabolic imprinting \u2014 defined as programming of metabolism during the prenatal and neonatal periods at the genomic and epigenomic level30 \u2014 might perma - nently affect future disease risk and health, as proposed by the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis31. Data from longitudinal birth cohorts are providing estimations of the development of obesity in childhood and adolescence, as well as about the genetic and environmental effects on BMI from infancy to the onset of adulthood. In the prenatal period, excessive maternal gesta - tional weight gain, especially in early pregnancy (first 20 weeks), is a risk factor for the development of overweight in children. Birth weight is a useful surro - gate marker of fetal nutrition. Both overnutrition and undernutrition during fetal life can trigger pathways that are responsible for obesity later in life32,33. A high birth weight has been associated with higher risk of obesity34, whereas a low birth weight has also been linked to a higher percentage of body fat, independent of BMI, and abdominal obesity in adolescents35. In infants, a rapid weight gain has also been associ- ated with a high risk of overweight later in life; this was summarized in some systematic reviews and in at least one meta-analysis36. The type and amount of energy-yielding nutrients consumed by the mother during pregnancy and lactation, and even by both parents before pregnancy, have been associated with the develop ment of metabolic complications in adulthood37. Longer duration of breastfeeding has been associated with a reduced prevalence of later life overweight38. Reduction of protein content in infant formulas was associated with a lower BMI and obesity risk at school age in one randomized clinical trial39 and needs to be further investigated. During childhood, an earlier adiposity rebound (FIG. 3 ) has been associated with a high BMI, a high amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue and a high waist circumference in adulthood40,41. Adolescence is a nutri - tionally vulnerable developmental stage because growth rate accelerates, as a consequence of high energy and nutrient needs. Pubertal timing influences BMI and is associated with BMI changes from childhood to adult - hood, whereas early puberty increases the risk of later obesity development42. Risk factors At first glance, the major drivers of the obesity epidemic are overly simple: overeating and sedentary lifestyles6. A small daily positive energy balance seems to be an important contributor of cumulative weight gain43, although the pathogenesis of obesity has proven to be more complex44 (FIG. 4 ). State-of-the-art epidemio- logical approaches, such as integrated bioinformatics system analyses, need to be used to better understand the causes of obesity, including the intricate interplay between behavioural, environmental, physiological, genetic, social and economic factors5. One of the complexities to study risk factors in obesity is the remarkable differences in the way people accumu - late body fat. An obvious example of such hetero geneity is the variation in body configuration and in regional accumulation of body fat at any given adipo sity level. Such heterogeneity in the obesity pheno types makes the study of what has been described in the past as a singular term (obesity) a challenge. Some have even suggested that we should refer to 'obesities' (REF. 45) rather than to obesity, as this condition cannot be considered as a homogeneous entity. In this regard, the development of imaging and integrative physio logical technologies, including devices to better phenotype individ uals with obesity and assess body composition and fat deposits (such as isotope labelling to determine brown fat pres - ence), has been a major advance. Thus, it might become possible to identify large subgroups of individuals with obesity with common characteristics who would possibly share common aetiological factors. The search for major gene effects in obesity has resulted in the successful identification of some mono - genic forms of obesity. Although relatively rare, the preva lence may be higher in consanguineous popula in MC4R (which encodes melano - cortin 4 receptor) account for up to 5% of extreme early- onset obesity and are the most prevalent genetic cause, together with FTO variants. Thus, genetics alone cannot explain the relatively recent (in the past 30 years) and rapid increase in the worldwide prevalence of obesity. Rather, it has become clear that obesity results from the interaction of several susceptibility genes (some of which have been identified) with diverse lifestyle factors47. In addition, the role of nutritional genomics including metabolomic issues, epigenomic signatures Box 1 | Metabolic syndrome According to the harmonized definition and clinical criteria given by the International Diabetes Federation, the American Heart Association and the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when three of the following five criteria occur simultaneously3: Visceral obesity: a waist circumference of 94 cm in men and 80 cm in women in the West (exact value depends on country-specific definitions) Hypertriglyceridaemia: 150 mg per dl or on triglyceride-lowering medication Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: <40 mg per dl for men and <50 mg per dl for women Elevated blood pressure: systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of 85 mmHg or antihypertensive drug treatment in a patient with a history of hypertension Increased glucose levels: fasting glucose levels of 100 mg per dl or drug treatment to lower increased levels of glucose Metabolic syndrome is a concept that was introduced to provide clinicians with simple screening tools to identify individuals who are likely to have insulin resistance and related metabolic abnormalities, which are mainly associated with visceral obesity. However, the clinical use of the metabolic syndrome has been challenged by some specialists201.

All rights reserved.and metagenomic screenings are fields with increasing interest to unveil the origins, causes or consequences of obesity and for precision management of patients48. Several biological and environmental factors have an effect on energy intake and expenditure (FIG. 4 ). For example, eating behaviours are shaped not only by genetic factors and other biological factors but also by the opportunities to eat, food availability and afford- ability and the built environment (which affects, among others, access to food and physical activity). In this con - text, food companies have adopted powerful market - ing strategies to induce people to eat more49. The food choices among energy-yielding food and snacking are enormous. Furthermore, eating away from home, which has been associated with obesity probably owing to the increase in portion size and other factors, has increased during the past several decades50. Physical activity, another behavi oural component, is also conditioned by socioeconomic and cultural factors (for example, transportation type, videogame play, computer use and occupation). A conjoint secular trend in sedentary life - styles coupled with increases in energy intake is able to greatly explain the observed increases in mean BMI in high- income countries51, but also probably in most low-income and middle- income countries. The number of sleeping hours has been reduced, increasing tiredness during the activity hours and food overconsumption while awake, thereby predisposing to a sedentary lifestyle and obesity52. Interestingly, the 'Mediterranean siesta' was reported to be inversely associated with obesity risk if this sleeping period was <30 minutes52. Moreover, night-shift work is related with sleep deprivation and its consequences7. However, the question of whether obesity mainly results from an excess caloric intake or from a reduced energy expenditure still remains under debate in academic circles, but all components of the energy balance equation are likely to be important. In addition to the quantity of calories, the type and quality (for example, saturated versus non-saturated lipids, as well as the source of fats, carbohydrates and proteins) of calories consumed also influence the energy balance and long-term body weight53. However, this area is still controversial; whether the dietary distribution of macronutrients on body weight, as well as the impact of a Figure 1 | Global body mass index in men and women.

A high-quality dietary pattern (defined by a balanced consumption of macronutrients, in which 10-20% of the energy is obtained from proteins, <30% from lipids and 50-55% from carbohydrates) is inversely associated with weight gain and the risk of developing obesity. This finding is also true for higher consumption of fruits and nuts, vegetables, whole grains, yoghurt and for adherence to the Mediterranean diet56 (BOX 2 ). On the contrary, increased consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages, potato chips, French fries, red and processed meats, commercially baked goods, trans -fats, refined grains and added sugars have been associated with higher weight gain57-60. Carefully conducted longitu - dinal studies support the benefits of consuming meals with healthy foods and complex carbohydrates with low glycaemic index (a value given to foods as a reference on the speed at which they increase blood glucose levels) and the importance of high-quality, sustainable dietary patterns in preventing obesity60-62. Comorbidities and mortality Population studies have clearly shown that individuals with obesity are at greater risk of developing numerous health complications that contribute to premature death than normal-weight individuals63,64 (FIG. 5 ). In addition to an increased risk of developing features of the meta- bolic syndrome (BOX 1 ), other common comorbidities are endocrine disorders (such as type 2 diabetes melli - tus), respiratory problems (for example, sleep apnoea), cardio vascular diseases (for example, atherosclerosis and heart attack) and cancers (for example, endometrial, liver and kidney cancers)65-68. Moreover, obesity has negative impacts not only on psychological and mood issues but also on cognitive function69. Epidemiological research into comorbidities and complications associated with obesity is limited by several reasons. One difficulty encountered in large population studies has been to define the non-obese 'normal-weight' reference group. Although guidelines have suggested that a BMI range of 18.5-25 kg/m2 was compatible with optimal health, a recent study pool - ing of individual data (about 4 million individuals from 189 studies who were followed-up on average for 13.7 years)70 has revealed that the BMI range associ - ated with lower mortality rates was around 20-25 kg/m2, with values below that range being associated with an increased mortality rate. This report has shed light on the controversy resulting from a previous study71 that proposed that individuals who are overweight and obe - sity class I (BMI: 30-34.9 kg/m2) had reduced mortality compared with non-obese individuals. However, this study included individuals with a high degree of lean - ness (18.5-20 kg/m2) in the non-obese 'normal-weight' group. These low-body-weight individuals were prob - ably responsible for the high mortality rate reported in the non-obese group, as some were likely to be smokers and/or have pre-existing chronic diseases that caused weight reduction. When the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration international group excluded current smokers and those with pre-existing chronic diseases, it became clear that overweight and obesity class I are associated with an increased mortality risk70. In addi - tion to the difficulties with determining the reference group, the study of obesity as a risk factor for all-cause mortality is methodologically challenging, especially during childhood72, because of confounders, such as smoking and reverse causation (that is, low body weight is the consequence of a chronic disease rather than the cause), and non-confounders, such as overadjustment for intermediate variables in the causal chain. Some studies have suggested that the lifetime max- imum BMI has a stronger association with mortality than the BMI at the time a survey is taken73. In a meta- analysis70 using individual participant data of 239 cohorts, overweight and obesity were significantly associ ated with total, cardiovascular and cancer mor - tality compared with the normal-weight group, after carefully addressing the issues of reverse causation and confounding by smoking. These associations were largely consistent between Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and North America popu lations. In addition to mortal - ity, obesity was also found to be associated with insulin resistance, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia74. Mechanisms/pathophysiology Body weight \u2014 and ultimately obesity \u2014 is deter - mined by the interaction of genetic, environmental and psycho social factors acting through several physio - logical mediators of food intake and energy expenditure that affect fat deposition (FIGS 4 ,6). Genetics and epigenetics Up to 70% of the inter-individual variation in body weight variability may be due to genetic differences between individuals75. Identification of genes that determine the susceptibility to obesity can provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie body weight regulation and fat distribution, which, in turn, can lead to new approaches for treatment and prevention.Figure 2 | Evolution of obesity prevalence. Since 1975, the global obesity prevalence has almost tripled. The prevalence of obesity is higher in women than in men.

All rights reserved.Research into monogenic obesity has shed light on the biology of obesity in the general population. The molecular mapping of mutations causing monogenic obesity in mice was one of the first strategies to search for genes that control body weight. Prominent outcomes of this approach include genes encoding leptin ( Lep) and its receptor genes affect body weight through pathways in the central nervous system76. Mutations in the human orthologues of these genes cause monogenic obesity77. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GW AS) that test the association of millions of common genetic variants without a prior hypothesis about their presumed role have identified >300 genetic loci for obesity traits. The first major success of GW AS was the discovery of the FTO locus78,79. A cluster of common non-coding variants in FTO showed a highly signifi - cant association with obesity risk78,79. The biology that underlies this association is only slowly getting resolved; the FTO locus may regulate the expression of nearby RPGRIP1L or distant IRX3-IRX5 to influence body weight, by regulating appetite, thermogenesis, adipo - cyte browning and epigenetic mechanisms related to obesity80,81. Additional GW AS have identified genetic loci associated with adiposity traits, BMI and waist-to- hip ratio82-84. Pathway and tissue enrichment analyses applied to the BMI-associated loci provide further sup - port for the role of the central nervous system in body weight regulation. Tissues with enriched expression of these genes include the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the hippocampus, and important pathways are those related to synaptic function and neurotransmitter signalling82. The same analyses applied to loci associated with the waist-to-hip ratio point to pathways implicated in adipogenesis, angiogenesis, insulin resistance and processes that affect fat distribution83. Despite highly significant associations, the effects of the established loci on the obesity outcomes are small. Of all established loci, FTO has the largest, but still small, effect on obesity susceptibility; each risk allele increases the risk of obesity by 1.20-1.32-fold, and BMI by 0.37 kg/m2 (equivalent to ~1,060 g in body weight for a person who is 1.70 m in height). The effect of other BMI-associated variants range between 0.08 and variants combined explain <5% of the variation in BMI82,84. The effect sizes and explained variance of variants associ - ated with the waist-to-hip ratio are of a similar mag - nitude83,84. However, interactions between genetic and environ mental factors may explain important individual differences in body weight response to the same environ - mental exposures84. Research is needed to cover the gap with the epidemiological data indicating that genetics may contribute to 20-25% of body weight variability. Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNAs that switch genes on and off without changing the DNA sequence, are sensitive to external factors (for example, diet and physi - cal activity) and internal factors (for example, hormones and genetic factors), are reversible and can be passed on to subsequent generations. Epigenetic processes are cell, time and tissue specific, which makes studying their roles in humans a major challenge. This statement is particularly true for obesity, given the central role of the brain in body weight regulation. Evidence for the role of epi genetics in obesity has come mostly from animal models85, and only occasionally from studies in humans, although >600 articles have already been published in this area. For example, sons born to women who were starved Figure 3 | Critical periods in the development of obesity. The first thousand days, from conception until the end of the second year of life, mark the first critical period in the development of obesity. Body mass index (BMI) usually increases until 7 months of age, when it reaches a temporary maximum (the socalled infant BMI peak). Between 5 and 7 years of age, the BMI reaches a minimum in children with adequate growth and development, after which it starts to rise again (that is, the adiposity rebound)221. During adolescence, BMI changes are substantially associated with puberty. Body weight at these critical periods is associated with later body composition222.Nature Reviews | Disease Primers Conception 2 mo 4 mo 6 mo 12 mo 24 mo 4 yr 6 yr 8 yr 10 yr 12 yr 14 yr 16 yr 18 yrInfant BMI peak Adiposity rebound Adolescence-associated gestational weight gainRelative weight change Birth First critical period Second critical period Third critical period High maternal BMI PRIMER 6 | ARTICLE NUMBER 17034 | VOLUME 3 www.nature.com/nrdp \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

This intergenerational study suggests that nutritional deprivation of pregnant mothers can have lasting non-genetic effects on body weight of the next generation. Although the methylation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 3A ( HIF3A) was considered to be associated with higher BMI, this association was found to be the conse - quence and not the cause of higher BMI88. However, the HIF system has been shown to play a key part in energy expendi ture and obesity89. Two other large-scale epi- genetic studies, involving 10,000 and 7,800 individuals, respectively, identified large numbers of DNA methyl ation loci associated with BMI: 187 in the first and 83 in the second study90,91. Again, methylation at a substantial pro - portion of the loci was the consequence of obesity, rather than the cause. Clearly, more evidence for a (causal) role of epigenetic processes in obesity is needed, but assessing the epigenome at the right time in life and in the relevant tissues is a major barrier for studies in humans92. Adipose tissue Types. The two major types of adipose tissues \u2014 white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue \u2014 have a crucial role in sensing and responding to changes in systemic energy balance93. Adipocytes in brown adipose tissue contribute to energy expenditure via thermogenesis to maintain body temperature94. Brown adipose tissue is abundant in newborn babies and is located in the inter - scapular and supraclavicular regions, as well as around the kidneys, heart, aorta, pancreas and the trachea; these brown adipose deposits decrease with age, but can still be found in adults95. Brown adipose tissue has been neg - atively correlated with the BMI96, although its precise role in the aetiology of obesity remains unclear. White adipo - cytes are the most abundant adipocytes in humans and have been long considered to have only an energy- storing function. However, recent research has revealed that these cells secrete various bioactive substances97 (that is, adipocytokines or adipokines) (FIG. 6 ). Furthermore, a distinct (but minor) type of adipocytes known as 'beige or brite adipocytes' is recruited in white adipose deposits as a novel type of energy-dissipating adipocytes. Adipose tissues are classified into subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue based on their location in the body. Visceral adipose tissues include intra-abdominal (mainly mesenteric adipose tissue), perirenal and pericardial adipose tissue. Researchers and clinicians have been the most interested in intra- abdominal adipose tissue, as its accumulation closely correlates with the development of the constellation of metabolic abnormalities commonly referred to as the metabolic syndrome98 (BOX 1 ). Pathological changes in adipose tissue. Although the list of clinical outcomes associated with obesity is rather extensive, the number and severity of these health com - plications seem to be dependent on the additional pres - ence of excess fat stores in inner adipose deposits (such as the abdominal visceral adipose tissue) and in and around normally lean tissues such as the heart, the liver and the kidneys \u2014 a phenomenon referred to as ectopic fat depo- sition74,99,100. Consistent evidence shows that the way adi - pose tissue manages the energy surplus and the abnormal oxygen tension generated by the pathological growth of the adipocytes101 has a profound effect on an individ ual's cardiometabolic risk profile, insulin sensi tivity and dys - lipidaemia (high levels of triglycerides or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). For instance, if the subcutaneous adipose tissue handles this energy excess by causing adipose tissue hyper plasia ( tissue growth owing to an increase in cell number), such properly expanding adipose tissue will then act as a 'metabolic sink' , protect - ing lean tissues (for example, the heart, liver, pancreas and the kidneys) against harmful ectopic fat deposition74,102. Conversely, if subcutaneous adipose tissue cannot expand through fat cell hyper plasia (for poorly understood reasons that are under study), the stored triglyceride molecules will first contribute to adipocyte hypertrophy (tissue growth owing to an enlargement of individual cells) until these large adipocytes become saturated and are no longer able to expand, leading to either their rup - ture and macrophage invasion and/or increased release of pro-inflammatory adipo kines and decreased release of adipo nectin by hypertrophied adipocytes. These phenomena contrib- ute to a pro- inflammatory and insulin- resistant milieu. Furthermore, as the expanding capacity of these hyper - trophied adipocytes becomes saturated, the excess triglyceride molecules will have no place to go in the sub - cutaneous adipose tissue and will be stored at undesired sites, such as the liver, heart, kidneys and pancreas \u2014 this ectopic fat deposition also generates an athero - genic, diabetogenic and inflammatory enviroment in the cell99 (FIG. 7 ).Figure 4 | Key factors involved in the regulation of energy balance. The energy balance is influenced by several biological factors. Although this balance indirectly relates to the first thermodynamic law, it cannot be translated to the level of causality. The pyramid holding the balance emphasizes the notion that we need to go beyond individual factors to ultimately have an optimal effect on the energy balance equation. *Could be affected by genetic and epigenetic factors.Nature Reviews | Disease Primers Individual Social and family environment Organizations and institutions Communities Public policiesEnergy intake Nervous system Endocrine system* Microbiota Stress or emotional MedicationsEnergy expenditure Resting energy expenditure* Thermic eect of nutrients* Controlled ambient temperatures Lack of sleep or shift work Physical activity-related energy expenditure PRIMER NATURE REVIEWS | DISEASE PRIMERS VOLUME 3 | ARTICLE NUMBER 17034 | 7 \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

All rights reserved.Imaging studies have now revealed that all these inner ectopic fat deposits tend to be correlated with each other, with some individual variation103-105. Thus, visceral obesity is often accompanied by excess fat in the liver, heart and kidneys, whereas the association is less evident for subcutaneous obesity106. Although excess visceral adipose tissue and excess liver fat often co-occur, some individuals with substantial visceral adipose tissue do not have excess liver fat, and vice versa107. Indeed, what the local drivers of regional differences in ectopic fat deposition are (genetic, hormonal and environmental), is a question that should receive further attention. In addition, all subcutaneous fat deposits are not equal and available data indicate that the healthiest 'meta bolic sink' may be the gluteal-femoral fat depot102. That is, lower body fat stores may not be neutral in terms of health risk; they may even be protective against several health outcomes including diabetes mellitus and cardio - vascular disease108. In this regard, the severe dysmetabolic state of patients with lipodystrophy (that is, those who lack subcutaneous adipose tissue) shows the importance of healthy subcutaneous adipose tissue109,110. Genetic and environmental factors influence regional subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulation, but this issue would require extensive cardiometabolic imaging studies111. Regulation of the energy balance Food intake triggers gastrointestinal signals mediated by mechanical distension or paracrine hormones, and nutrient signals that modulate appetite involving differ - ent neurotransmitters, gut-brain peptides, amino acids and neuropeptides. The autonomic nervous system and several circulating hormones have also been involved in the metabolic response to food intake and nutrient metabolism, which affects appetite, thermogenesis and fat deposition, among other processes112 (FIG. 6 ). The role of microbiota is under considerable investi- gation, as it has been found that the microbiota of individ uals with obesity is less diverse and have a dif - ferential proportion of firmicutes to bacteroidetes113,114. Although more studies are needed, it seems that this micro biota dysbiosis favours an inflammatory status, impairs the metabolism of some nutrients, influences energy extraction and affects the way this energy is expended and stored. Other endogenous factors associ- ated with obesity might induce a disruption of appe - tite control, shifts in thermogenesis and futile cycles, adipogenesis impairments, inflammatory processes and lipid metabolism disturbances7. Diagnosis, screening and prevention Obesity phenotypes As mentioned before, patients with obesity with meta- bolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance and dyslipid aemia, often have an excess of abdominal visceral adipose tissue12. CT and MRI can provide an estimate of the amount of fat stored in different adipose tissue com - partments as this may greatly differ between individ uals, but are not routinely used in the diagnosis of obesity74. The concomitant presence of high adiposity combined with low muscle mass (sarcopenia) may be associ - ated with a greater prevalence of cardiometabolic abnor - malities than individuals with the same BMI but higher muscle mass115; this diagnostic entity is known 'sarco- penic Sex-specific and BMI-specific refer ence curves for appendicular skeletal muscle index (that is, the sum of the muscle masses of the four limbs divided by the square height in metres) and fat mass index, which is measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in adults, are available116. The metabolically healthy obese phenotype category is used to describe individuals with obesity who do not meet the clinical criteria of the metabolic syndrome117,118 (BOX 1 ). During adulthood, the main predictor for the conversion of the metabolically healthy obese pheno - type to the unhealthy phenotype is visceral abdominal fat accumulation119. However, controversy exists as the meta bolically healthy obese phenotype is not well defined and also tends to be a transient phenomenon and, there - fore, not a benign condition117, as it is often only a matter of time until the individual develops complications.Box 2 | Healthy dietary patterns The DASH diet: an eating plan that emphasizes eating fruits, vegetables and whole grains rather than refined grains. Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts and vegetable oils are included, but foods that are high in saturated fats (such as fatty meats and full-fat dairy products), tropical oils (such as coconut, palm kernel and palm oils) and sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets should be limited. The Mediterranean diet: emphasizes eating primarily plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts. Butter is replaced with healthy fats, such as olive oil. Herbs and spices are used as flavourings instead of salt. Red meat is limited to no more than a few times a month. Fish and poultry are eaten at least twice a week. Drinking red wine in moderation is optional. The RESMENA diet: a variant of the Mediterranean diet that considers the intake of fruit and/or vegetables with antioxidant capacity and the number of meals per day202. Figure 5 | The relationship between the body mass index and mortality and morbidity risk. The graph shows the increased health risk associated with extreme leanness and obesity. In addition, the upper and lower dashed lines illustrate the notion that a positive relationship between body mass index (BMI) and health outcome can be modulated by several factors. Factors that increase the risk for a given BMI include increased age, smoking, sedentary behaviours, diet of poor nutritional quality, excess of abdominal visceral adipose tissue and ectopic fat, and poor cardiorespiratory fitness. Factors that decrease the health risk for a given BMI are, for example, physically active lifestyle, high level of cardiorespiratory fitness, high-quality diet, and low levels of visceral adipose or ectopic fat.UnderweightNormal IIIObese class II BMI (kg/m2)Relative mortality and morbidity risk 18.5 25 30 35 40 Nature Reviews | Disease Primers PRIMER 8 | ARTICLE NUMBER 17034 | VOLUME 3 www.nature.com/nrdp \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Studies have pointed to clear health risks for individuals with this pheno - type120, especially among Asian populations121, whose optimal cut-off values were approximately 24 and 23 kg/m2 for BMI, for men and women, respectively122. Thus, BMI cut-off values need to be adapted according to ethnicity.Evaluation The BMI should be measured in all individuals in clin- ical care settings64. The paradox of BMI in obesity assess - ment is that it is not a perfect index of adiposity, but is highly predictive of cardiometabolic risk123. The addi - tion of the waist-to-hip ratio to BMI gives even a better prediction of cardiovascular disease124. BMI assessment should be accompanied by indices of body shape (such as waist circum ference) and other features (such as blood pressure, and glucose and cholesterol levels) to define precisely the risk in individuals. Overweight and obesity are defined using BMI cri - teria for adults. For children, the BMI Z-score (a score based on the BMI standard deviation) is often preferred to facilitate the analysis of different ethnic popu lations125,126. To overcome the limitations of BMI in clinical practice, in addition to measuring waist circumference, diverse obesity staging systems, taking into account other factors such as dyslipidaemia and glucose homeostasis, have been devised to help health professionals facilitate categoriz - ing people according to weight-related health problems and to select appropriate treatments. Examples are the Edmonton Obesity Staging System, the Cardiometabolic Staging System, the ATPIII panel and the Framingham risk score, among others127,128. Skinfold thickness measurements and bio electrical impedance analyses (BOX 3 ) can also be used in clinical practice to provide estimates of total body fat. However, measuring body folds and electrical conductivity are only proxies of the fat and lean mass owing to the imprecise assessment characteristics of these tools. Sex, age and ethni city percentiles are currently available, based on fat mass measurements using DXA values in the NHANES study 1999-2004 (REF. 129). Useful reference methods to measure total body fat exist, but their use is limited to laboratory settings; they mainly include densitometry and imaging-based methods, such as MRI and CT8,9. Prevention Obesity prevention should focus on maintaining weight loss or controlling excessive weight gain130. Potential pre - ventive strategies are health promotion programmes or marketing, addressing lifestyle behaviours and policies that target the environment131 (FIG. 4 ). In general, the intervention should start as early as pos - sible, even during the periconceptional period. However, experience in early interventions is limited. Thus, in a sys - tematic review132 on interventions during the first crit- ical period (FIG. 3 ), only two prenatal interventions were included, with no effect on the BMI of the offspring. The first intervention included lifestyle interventions dur - ing gestation, such as dietary counsel ling, coaching and physical activity133; the second intervention consisted of monitor ing and control of gestational diabetes melli - tus using dietary advice, blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy if necessary134. Of the six interventions that were implemented from pregnancy and infancy, only two were effective. In one of the effective studies, eight educational home visits by community health profes - sionals focusing on infant diet, feeding and activity were Figure 6 | Control of hunger and satiety. Hunger and satiety are controlled by complex interactions between the nervous system, nutrients, mechanical sensing, circadian rhythms and hormones. Several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the hypothalamus are involved in the regulation of food intake. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AGRP) melanocyte-stimulating and amphetamine-regulated transcript protein (CART) and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) suppress food intake. Nesfatin 1 regulates hunger and fat storage. Thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine) are involved in several physiological processes, including the regulation of the basal metabolic rate and body temperature, but other efferent signals are also involved, such as the autonomic nervous system. Several adipokines (such as 1 and angiotensinogen) produced by adipose tissues may mediate appetite, thermogenesis, inflammation and fat deposition. Leptin is also known as the 'satiety hormone' that regulates energy balance by inhibiting hunger; it opposes the action of ghrelin, the 'hunger hormone'. Adiponectin regulates several metabolic processes (including acid oxidation) and has potent anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic anti-atherogenic properties. Mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1; also known as thermogenin) is involved in heat generation by inducing non-shivering thermogenesis. polypeptide (GIP)), insulin, glucagon and serotonin) are involved in the uptake of food, metabolism and the control of hunger. Some of these hormones increase food intake (for example, ghrelin) and others decrease food intake (such as GLP1, serotonin, CCK and insulin).

According to another systematic review137, few studies were done in children <2 years of age; these studies were aiming to promote diet- ary behaviours or a combination of nutrition education and physical activity, but no intervention was apparently effective in terms of child weight status. Although systematic reviews on the effectiveness of childhood obesity prevention programmes have shown diverse and often conflicting results, some strategies were found to be useful138,139, such as the implementa - tion of health education on nutrition, more physical activity lessons in the school curricula and the provi - sion of healthy food at school. Limited evidence for the effectiveness of policies focusing on the child's environ- ment and health information technologies focusing on children and parents is available. Performing interven - tions in primary care settings could improve parenting practices and promote healthy eating habits, but available studies showed only limited effect140.The complexity of obesity requires multilevel and multi component interventions that take a systems approach. Multilevel approaches focus on changing health behaviours by acting on multiple frameworks: in practice, going from the individual, often children or adolescents, schools or occupational environments and the communities. Multicomponent interventions incorporate more than one strategy to modify behav - iours, within the same level141. For the development of the interventions, health promotion models should consider information on the determinants, such as the target population and opportunities in the correspond - ing societ ies. According to the WHO report 'Ending Childhood Obesity' (REF. 142), factors to be taken into account include maternal-child health, nutritional education and health literacy, parents' perceptions of healthy infant growth and development, peer pressure, family eating and physical activity behaviour, and the role of food and built environments. A broad perspective is necessary, as focusing just on one or a limited number of components or on the health sector alone is unlikely to be effective142. Despite the many identified limitations of obesity prevention programmes, policy efforts to prevent childhood obesity should continue143. Self-monitoring could be important in weight loss intervention144. Management Current management of obesity is aimed at weight loss by taking a risk-based approach using low-risk treatments, such as lifestyle interventions, dietary changes and exer - cise, as the first-line choice, followed by medication or surgery in selected cases. Several guidelines have been developed in the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe to aid the health care professional in treating the patient with obesity145-150. Response to any treatment is variable, and strategies to lose weight may be different from those for maintaining weight loss151. Lifestyle interventions Behavioural modification in lifestyle programmes has been an important part of programmes for weight loss for more than a quarter of a century149,152,153. A meta- analysis showed a mean weight loss of 3.01 kg (95% CI: 4.02-2.01) with behavioural changes154. Behavioural modification helps patients to understand and moni - tor144 their eating behaviour, from the triggers that start it to the location, speed and type of eating, through to the consequences of eating and the rewards that can change it155. It also consists of strategies to help people to develop assertive behaviour, learn cognitive techniques for handl ing their internal discussions, and ways of deal - ing with stress. The newest innovation in the use of life - style interventions is implementation of online tools, including automated e-mail feedback, e-mail counselling and behavioural therapy156. Diets Diets for the management of body weight have only been rigorously tested in randomized controlled trials in the past 20 years151. Negative energy balance through caloric restriction is commonly used to prod uce weight Figure 7 | Pathological changes in adipose tissue. A large-scale study revealed that the absolute value of visceral fat area correlated with obesity-associated cardiovascular risks, but cardiovascular risks did not increase with the increase of subcutaneous fat223. Accordingly, adipose tissues in subcutaneous fat obesity might function normally with the expected release of anti-inflammatory adipokines, whereas adipose tissues in visceral fat obesity release an increased amount of pro-inflammatory adipokines and suppress the secretion of anti-inflammatory adipocytokines, thereby creating low-grade inflammation, which contributes to systemic metabolic and cardiovascular impairment that is associated with obesity-related disorders224,225. Pathological changes in visceral adipose tissue show higher levels of adipocyte necrosis, owing in part to abnormal oxygen tension in the expanded fat depots, and the recruitment of macrophages with an inflammatory phenotype (M1 macrophages) that are arranged around dead fat Subcutaneous fat Nature Reviews | Disease PrimersProtection against inflammation, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseaseAnti-inflammatory adipokinesAdiponectin | VOLUME 3 www.nature.com/nrdp \u00a9 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

A restriction of 500 kcal per day or an individ- ualized -30% energy restriction, or a diet with 1,200 kcal per day for women and 1,500 kcal per day for men is generally recommended. Interestingly, improving over - all nutritional quality without a direct energy restriction (for example, with the Mediterranean diet; BOX 2 ) can also be helpful to reduce weight61,157. However, adherence to the diet ary programme is key149. In a meta-analysis of many popular diets, the low- carbohydrate diets prod - uced a weight loss of 7.25 kg after 12 months compared with 7.27 kg low-fat diets, which is essentially no differ - ence158. Inter-individual weight loss is high with all diets; some people lose a lot of weight and others actually gain weight151. Genetic variability may provide an explanation for some of the differential response to diets151. Differences in macronutrient composition do not always favour any one diet over another, which stresses the concept of involving the patient in the selection of a diet to increase compliance149. Preference should be given to one of several healthy dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean, the DASH or the RESMENA diets (BOX 2 ), which can be used as 'weight loss diets' in low- calorie versions55. Lower-fat diets are associated with lower levels of low-density lipoproteins, and higher-fat diets are associated with lower levels of triglycerides and higher levels of high-density lipoproteins in shorter- term weight loss studies, but these lipid effects gener - ally dis appear over the longer term when weight loss has plateaued and weights are not different according to diet group151. For long-term weight loss maintenance, adherence to the diet is important, but the macro nutrient composition may have a role159. Higher protein intake, foods with a low glycaemic index and lower fat intake may benefit in maintaining weight loss, whereas higher- carbohydrate diets may favour weight regain151,160. Dietary recommen - dations for weight control should consider the overall quality of the diet and long-term health effects, as well as the role of specific amino acids, fatty acids, bioactive compounds, or the number of meals and timing of food consumption, and macronutrient distribution161.Physical activity As for all sedentary individuals, the current recom - mendation is to gradually increase aerobic physical activity in patients with obesity, by, for example, brisk walking, to reach a goal of >150 minutes per week162,163. This strategy has health benefits independent of weight loss, as moderate levels of physical activity lower the risk of developing diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease163, which is maybe related to the fact that it has the potential to reduce harmful visceral adipose tissue and ectopic fat12. A meta-analysis indicated that phys - ical activity results in 1-1.5 kg more weight loss over 12 months than with a dietary intervention alone164. For long-term weight maintenance, 60-90 minutes of exercise per day may be required149,162,165. In the Look AHEAD trial, the increase in activity at 1 year was not maintained at 4 years, and there was an increase in weight after year 1 in the intervention group, although they remained below their initial weight during an 8 year follow-up166. The type of physical activity (for example, aerobic versus resistance exercise or high- intensity versus low-intensity activity) does not seem to affect overall weight loss. However, more intense activity might be preferable for some individuals as it takes less time167. Medical management Drugs for use in treating patients with obesity are approved as adjuncts to diet and exercise and none has been approved for use in pregnancy, nursing or paediat - ric populations145,152,168 (TABLE 1 ). The use of these drugs should be reserved for patients with moderate-risk or high-risk obesity (a BMI of >30 kg/m2 BMI of >27 kg/m2 if comorbidities are present)145. As they are intended for patients who are struggling to lose and maintain weight loss, a history of lack of success in the past is a pre requisite. All of these medications work through helping patients to better adhere to their diets, except orlistat and cetilistat (which is only available in Japan), which helps to enforce a low-fat diet. Thus, these medications should only be used with an effort of diet - ing. There is no ideal medication so far; in the right patient, any of them can be successful. If patients have not lost 4-5% of their body weight after 3 months, the drug should be stopped and another approach used145. The medications currently approved in the United States for chronic weight manage ment are listed in TABLE 1 ; drugs availability in other countries may vary. Abuse of amphetamines, methamphetamine and phenmetrazine is well established, and these agents are approved by the US FDA for short-term treatment (usually consid ered <12 weeks), but not for long-term treatment, of the patient with obesity. Bariatric surgery Use of bariatric surgery (also known as metabolic sur - gery) has become rapidly adopted as a treatment option for severe obesity, and this has increased with the advent of lower-risk laparoscopic procedures. The criteria for consideration are a BMI of >40 kg/m2 or a BMI of >35 kg/m2 with comorbidities, such as hypertension Box 3 | Tools available to determine body composition Anthropometry: the measurement of the physical properties of the human body, including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and skinfold thickness. Bioelectrical impedance analyses: determines the electrical impedance, or resistance to the flow of an electric current, through the body; this parameter can then be used to calculate an estimate of total body water. On the basis of the constant hydration of fat-free mass, total body fat can be calculated. Densitometry -Underwater weighing: determines body density by measuring the mass per unit volume of the body; density is used to estimate the total body fat. -Air displacement plethysmography: based on the same principle as underwater weighing, but uses air displacement rather than water immersion. Imaging-based methods -Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry: a widely used method to study bone mineral density, from which the total body fat can also be estimated. -MRI or CT: mainly used to estimate abdominal fat in obesity research.

Patients with pre-diabetes or recent- onset diabetes may qualify with a BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2 (REFS 169,170). Bariatric surgery can be per - formed on an individual basis in adolescents who are markedly overweight. Nearly half a million surgical proce dures were performed worldwide in 2013 (REF. 152). There are a range of interventions that result in varying degrees of weight loss and each has its own risks and benefits that need to be considered carefully with each patient171,172 (FIG. 8 ). Outcomes following bariatric surgery have gener - ally shown favourable results173. The Swedish Obese Subjects study has followed -up 2,000 patients for up to 20 years who were operated on with one of 3 sur - gical procedures: banded gastroplasty, gastric banding and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (FIG. 8 ). Mortality was reduced by 24%, mainly owing to reduced risk of myo - cardial infarction and, in women, cancer compared with a control group receiving usual care173. Many other comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and sleep apnoea, are also improved, and patients report consistent improvements in quality of life. The weight loss averaged 23% at 1 year and 18% at 20 years.Glucose control rapidly improves in patients with obesity who have type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially following bariatric surgery, suggesting that part of the metabolic improvement is independent of weight loss173. Head-to-head randomized controlled trials of surgical treatment against intensive medical treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus have consistently shown greater improvements in glucose control in the surgical group174. Observational data also exist, which indicate that future risk of diabetes-related microvascular and macro vascular complications are also reduced follow - ing bariatric surgery175. Remission of diabetes mellitus is largely driven by weight loss, although several gastro - intestinal hormones, including glucagon-like peptide 1, poly peptide YY and ghrelin, have also been impli - cated176. These encouraging data need to be put into the context of potential risks and adverse effects of surgery, which for some patients can be distressing or disabling. Among six studies in the Cochrane review, one death was reported with modern laparoscopic bariatric sur - gery, but re-operation rates ranged from 6.7% to 24% in the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group and 3.3% to 34% in the laparoscopic banded group177.

Lifelong replacement therapy and monitoring are required for nutritional vitamin and mineral deficiencies, particularly after malabsorptive operations. Dumping syndrome, gastro-oesophageal reflux and hypoglycaemia can be very distressing and a challenge to treat. Weight regain can also be a prob - lem, and revision surgery carries greater risks with no guarantee of success178. Quality of life The population burdens of obesity and overweight are substantial and represent priorities for public health179. By 2030, health care costs owing to obesity-related dis - eases are projected to reach $48-66 billion per year in the United States alone68. The increased risks for obesity-associated condi - tions, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer, account for a sub - stantial part of this burden20,65-68. However, overweight and obesity are also known to have a substantial effect on emotional well-being, self-esteem and psychosocial health180. Overweight and obesity are usually associated with a lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) than normal weight (BOX 4 ). Studies conducted in diverse set - tings (the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia) have reported a monotonic trend, showing that as BMI increases, HRQOL decreases181. For example, in the Rancho Bernardo cohort, California, USA (including community-dwelling), using the Quality of Well-Being Scale (BOX 4 ), the normal BMI group had the highest score, followed by the underweight, overweight and obese groups182. HRQOL estimates using the EQ-5D tool183 (BOX 4 ) in the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey184 con - cluded that overweight men and women lost 270,000 and 1.8 million quality-adjusted life years, respectively, relative to their normal-weight counterparts. Men and women with obesity lost 1.9 million and 3.4 million quality- adjusted life years, respectively, per year. The authors of the study suggested that these sex differences might be explained by three facts: very fit men are more likely to be erroneously included in the overweight, or even obese, group; obesity in women tends to primarily affect morbidity instead of mortality, therefore, women have a longer lifespan than men; and psychological morbidity is a bigger burden in women than in men. Much of this burden of disease arose from lower HRQOL and shorter life expectancy. A vicious cycle can occur in which poorer HRQOL and impaired mental health can act as triggers for sub - sequent weight gain185,186, potentially adding to the enor - mous global problem of continually rising population obesity rates. Thus, quantification of the amount of weight loss that is needed to obtain a sufficiently large improvement in quality of life (that is, a clinically impor - tant difference) is required. For example, in the two large cohorts of the Nurses-I and Nurses-2 Health Studies, weight gains were associated with lower physical com - ponent scores, whereas weight losses were associated with higher physical component scores, role limitations Figure 8 | Bariatric surgery. a | The abdominal gastric band is an inflatable silicone band placed just below the gastro-oesophageal junction to create a small gastric pouch with a narrow stoma. A subcutaneous port, which allows adjustment of the tightness, is attached to the band. Frequent followup is essential to achieve the optimal band tightness for each patient. This procedure is technically easy, but weight loss is less than with other bariatric procedures. b | The sleeve gastrectomy involves placement of a staple line along the greater curvature of the stomach, followed by the removal of the closed stomach. This produces an elongation from the oesophago-gastric junction to the pylorus. This procedure is now among the most widely performed, and the weight loss is comparable to the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. c | The RouxenY gastric bypass involves laparoscopic division of the jejunum approximately 50 cm from the ligament of Treitz, and the proximal end of the jejunum is anastomosed to the distal part of the jejunum about 150 cm below the site of transection, producing a jejunojejunostomy. The resultant 150 cm Roux limb of the proximal jejunum is brought up and anastomosed to the small proximal gastric pouch, providing a volume of about 15-30 ml. This procedure is more technically demanding, but competes with the sleeve gastrectomy.

However, the relationship of weight change with mental health component scores, social functioning and role limitations due to emotional problems was small187. In the majority of people with severe obesity, minimally clinical meaningful improvements in HRQOL from a clinical point of view were only achieved after weight loss of 20% over 2 years188. Although it seems intuitive that weight loss would lead to improvements in HRQOL, the magnitude of weight loss needed for clinically significant improvements in HRQOL among individuals with obesity has been seldom quantified, and few publications have specifically aimed to assess the correlation between specific weight changes and changes in HRQOL. Recently, a systematic review of literature from the United States, including 20 publications that analysed publications using the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF -36) and/or the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) to measure quality of life, showed that clinically relevant weight loss (usually >5%) after bariatric surgery may be associated with improvements in HRQOL. In non-bariatric stud - ies with weight loss of 5%, improvements in some aspects of HRQOL were noted, although the causal nature of the relationship was uncertain. In both bariatric and non-bariatric studies, many domains of the usual tools (SF-36 or IWQOL-Lite) increased, but improvements were mainly significant for physical domains, and not so often for mental dimensions of the quality of life179. The vitality domain of the SF -36 apparently was the most sensitive score to weight loss. In children and adolescents, overweight and obesity do not usually lead to major immediate comorbidities, but they are associated with more-sedentary lifestyles, lower levels of self-esteem, social exclusion, suboptimal achievements in education and also with lower quality of life189-192. Outlook Pathophysiology A deeper understanding of appetite and food prefer - ences is needed, which should include satiety, taste receptors, neuronal circuits and neurotransmitters. The thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue with the latest discovery of beige adipocytes is also gaining interest193. In this regard, better understanding of the transformation of white adipocytes into beige and finally brown adipocytes to increase thermogenesis is crucial. Individualized precision nutrition The role of genetics, epigenetics, nutrigenomics (the study of the interaction between nutrition and genes founded on 'omics' technologies) or personalized nutri - tion remains to be better understood to improve obesity management194. However, it is important to balance the individual and the epidemiological values of the per - sonalized approach versus population-based strategies. Precision nutrition based on phenotypical and geno- typical data holds some promise but seems unlikely to solve the global obesity epidemic, which is largely a societal problem. The following information for precision medicine and feeding should be considered to individ- ualize the treatment: family background; clinical history and lifestyle; food preferences, allergies and intolerances; epigenetics; culture and religion; socioeconomic status; hours of sleep or work shift; extensive working hours; and chronobiology (a science speciality based on the study of biological rhythms), among others. Indeed, precision nutrition depends on integrating genetic and epigenetic data with phenotypical information about the individ - ual48. New genetic and approaches, metabolomics, metagenomics epigenetics, among others194, under the umbrella of omics technologies, are relevant for the future implementation of individualized nutrition together with more precise body composition measurements, big data Box 4 | HRQOL tools use in QOL research in obesity The two most frequently used tools to assess quality of life (QOL) in the field of obesity are the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite)203-205. Other generic health-related QOL (HRQOL) measures used are the Quality of Well-Being Scale and the EQ-5D (EuroQOL). The SF-36 (one of the most frequently used tools to assess QOL) is a generic self-reported measure of HRQOL comprising 36 questions across eight domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional and mental health). The IWQOL-Lite204,206 is a validated, obesity-specific, self-reported measure of QOL. The IWQOL-Lite assesses physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress and work. Total scores on the IWQOL-Lite scales range from 0 to 100 (in which 0 indicates the poorest HRQOL). It is usually assumed that a threshold for change in a clinically important difference over time in the SF-36 is at least 5 points, and an improvement of 7.7-12 points (depending on baseline scores) in the IWQOL-Lite total score represents a clinically important difference in patients with obesity207,208. QOL measures for youth have also been reported in an IWQOL-Kids version, which has established minimal clinically important difference scores209,210.

Indeed, it is necessary to define obesity more precisely, improving the measurement of body composition and defining obesity subtypes. As obesity rates continue to increase worldwide, new therapeutical approaches or tools are needed (BOX 5 ). Prevention Undoubtedly, more attention and financial support should be paid to the prevention of obesity19. At the popu- lation level, public policies and economical strategies are needed to improve food and physical environ ments, the food system and the health system to curb the global obesity epidemic. For example, some efforts have been enacted for higher taxes on sugary drinks, unhealthy fats and fast foods, and calorie labels on menus, for example, in Mexico, France, Finland, Hungary and Denmark18. In addition, many communities are working on facilitat - ing physical activity and more sleeping hours by changing TV programming and increasing the green areas, side - walks, and biking lanes in the cities195,196. Furthermore, living at higher altitudes seems to prevent weight gain197 and the metabolic syndrome198. One hypothesis is that the decreased oxygen availability at higher altitudes increases the calories burnt for the same activity compared with lower altitudes, and this extra effort improves cardio- respiratory health in the long term. Several behavioural approaches, including motivational interviewing tech - niques, focus groups and multicomponent programmes involving cognitive strategies, have been designed for adults199, and incentive-based behavioural changes target ing children have been investigated200, suggesting that public health nutrition should coexist with precision individualized nutrition. 1.
