This long and well-documented history is one of compassionate and successful treatment for a wide variety of conditions. As a complete and coherent system of health care, Chinese medicine's primary goal is to create wholeness and harmony within a person by strengthening and supporting the body's ability to heal.](https://michelleracich.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/11.jpg) Chinese medical theory has within it three principal aspects. They are: yin yang and five phase theory; internal organ (zhang fu) theory; and channel theory. \"The theory of yin-yang and the five phases represents the basic language of traditional Chinese medicine. With this language, the parts of the body, disease, and basic treatment principles can be categorized... Organ theory categorizes physiology and pathology... Channel theory describes the network that brings the other theories to life. It integrates the organs and links the body to the world at large.\" - Wang Ju-Yi and Jason D. Roberstson The language of Chinese medicine includes a deep and rich understanding of the concept of qi. Qi is the expression of life. Qi is the energy of the body. Chinese medicine's primary concern is bringing harmony to the whole human being. As the quality of qi changes, the symptoms associated with a lack of flow will gradually improve. Qi: In Chinese medicine, qi (ki, chi) is the underlying vibration and resonance of life, its vital energy. Channels: Qi resonates within the body through a matrix of channels sometimes known as meridians. This channel network governs organs, tissues, emotional and mental faculties, and cellular activities by regulating and balancing the flow of qi. QIGONG Qigong is an ancient and important part of Chinese medicine. It is a self-healing support system that focuses on breath, body, and mind. Qigong is about the cultivation of qi (the vibration and resonance of life) by strengthening attention and intention through relaxed, gentle, meditative movement. It is, literally, \"energy work.\" While not a martial art on its own, qigong includes principles core to the practice of the martial arts and central to the art of life, as well. Qigong (\"chee gung\") is a 3,000 year-old, gentle form of self-healing that combines movement, breath, and visualization to balance body, mind and spirit. \"Qi\" means energy or life force and \"gong\" means to cultivate. Grow your energy! Qigong can increase your energy, and heal or prevent many common illnesses. It is especially effective in reducing stress, strengthening the immune system, improving mental focus, supporting a healthy sleep cycle, deepening a sense of inner peace.
