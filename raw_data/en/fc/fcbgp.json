No wonder people get confused in the supplement aisles, local health food stores, and when shopping online for vitamins! Supplement brands do vary a lot in quality, so this post is here to help you distinguish the best vitamins and supplements from those that you should leave on the shelf. I will also teach you the criteria to look for so that you can always make sound decisions when looking for quality supplement vitamin brands. {As an Amazon affiliate, I make income from qualifying purchases from links in this post} Table of Contents What to look for in vitamin products The 10 top criteria to look for in a quality supplement are given to you here using a functional nutrition perspective. If you are like most people, you want a supplement that makes you feel better and helps reduce health issues, not create more. The premise of functional nutrition and supplements are that you should replace nutrients in their natural forms to help get to the root cause of illnesses. The root causes of illnesses often are a lack of the right antioxidants and nutrients. Other important things to consider are that our foods today aren't usually providing us with what they need on a daily basis, as research shows [ [R](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537775/)]. This means our bodies can suffer without adequate micronutrients, which contribute to feeling poorly and making our immune systems suffer. Supplements and recommendations I'm including in this post meet the most rigorous of standards. Here are the criteria you want for best health: 1. Look for GMP vitamins certification For the best vitamin brands, certification of quality, potency, and purity is important. You can look for GMP on your label to know if your supplement has what it says it has. GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified vitamin supplements are consistently high in quality and help guarantee pure products because they are checked for quality by independent third-party companies [ [R](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4399016/)]. However, most retail supplements are not GMP supplements certified, so make sure to look for one of these symbols on the label. NSF International is a company that often conducts third-party testing to assure that vitamin and supplement products meet safety and health standards.

Find moderate vitamin doses-usually If you are eating a healthy diet, you can get many (but likely not all!) nutrients from your diet. Most people benefit from moderate doses of vitamins, but more is not always better. Generally, around 100% of the RDI is a good starting point for most vitamins, but there are several exceptions. Some people require higher doses of vitamins than are in a multivitamin. For example: - Vitamin D is a nutrient that you may need more than the RDI levels. - Certain metabolic conditions require high-dose vitamins. - Many medications make it so you require more than the RDI for vitamins. When do high doses of vitamins cause harm? - High doses of some vitamins types, like vitamin E, can increase your risk of bleeding. - While most Americans are low in vitamin E, a moderate dose of added vitamin E in natural forms is best. If you are taking high doses of vitamins, it is best to check with your health provider that is knowledgeable about nutrition, such as a functional medicine doctor or functional nutritionist. 3. Activated vitamin forms are usually better Activated vitamins are usually the best option for health because they don't rely on the body's enzymes to be efficient at converting into ideal forms of vitamins. - A good example of this is activated folate or activated B6 as pyridoxal-5-phosphate, which are both activated B-vitamins. - Other examples of activated vitamins are vitamin D3, a better form of vitamin D than vitamin D2. Tip: prescription vitamin D2 contains the less-desirable form of vitamin D2. Another example of an activated vitamin is retinol palmitate, which can be preferable over beta carotene. Around 40% of people don't efficiently make [active vitamin A ](https://thehealthyrd.com/single-post-2017-06-15-how-vitamin-a-will-save-the-day/)in their bodies. 4. Capsules of vitamins or chewable vitamin forms are best Simply put, capsules, chewables, and liquid vitamins are easier for the body to break down than tablets. With tablet vitamin forms, much of it may go directly into the toilet, unfortunately. Capsules are also less likely to be full of filler ingredients than tablets-that your body doesn't need. Chewable vitamins are great options for children because they often can't swallow capsules. Tip: Avoid gummy vitamins for adults and gummy vitamins for children. Most gummy vitamins are more candy than vitamins. They may taste good, but are very lacking! The exception for gummies is when you want to take extra vitamin C or extra vitamin D. In this case, taking a gummy vitamin is fine. 5. Find absorbable minerals Supplements often get it wrong about mineral forms. For example, some forms of minerals pass through the body without absorbing well, if at all. A supplement brand is only as good as its ability to absorb and this isn't always easy to find. Tips: - Avoid magnesium oxide or zinc oxide minerals: these are in almost all retail vitamin and mineral supplements! - Choose magnesium, zinc, or potassium that is attached to amino acids or organic compounds. This is called chelation. Good examples of chelated minerals are bound to an amino acid. Examples are dimagnesium malate and ascorbate or magnesium glycinate. 6. Get natural forms of vitamins Vitamins in their natural forms work better than synthetic vitamins. For example, natural folate is better than folic acid for most people. - Recent research shows that [folic acid](https://thehealthyrd.com/single-post-2018-04-08-folate-versus-folic-acid-are-they-equal/)may be problematic for health due to many people's difficulty with its metabolism. - After all, folic acid is synthetic and just different enough from the natural form that people often can't metabolize it. A common gene variant called MTHFR makes folic acid supplements problematic because they can block folate receptors in the body. With this, you may have unmetabolized folic acid in your bloodstream. Tip: Choose a natural folate supplement. You can look for these on a label to find natural folate supplement forms: - Folate - L-MTHF (l-methyltetrahydrofolate) - Levomefolate - Calcium folinate - Methylfolate 7. Should contain natural antioxidants Natural antioxidant supplements are going to also be rich in vitamins and vise versa. - Vitamin supplements=-natural variety is going to help dampen down inflammation as well as replenish the body with nutrients. - This means that supplements with natural antioxidants and vitamins are going to be healthier than synthetic vitamins. Tip: The best vitamin manufacturers don't manufacture vitamins at all-they extract vitamins from foods. Examples would be folate from lemons, vitamin C from broccoli; this means you are going to get thousands of antioxidants rather than just a few. Your fish oil should be sourced naturally too and have antioxidants like [cod liver oil](https://thehealthyrd.com/cod-liver-oil-vs-fish-oil-vs-krill-oil-which-is-best/). 8. Whole food-based vitamins are best Your body isn't easily fooled by synthetic vitamins. Synthetic vitamins are close, but not identical to the natural vitamin forms, and the body can tell. If your nutrients are made in a factory, they are less likely to be absorbed and metabolized well by the body. Look for vitamins and minerals sourced from whole foods. The top nutritional supplement brands in the world are transparent about ingredients, sourcing, and quality. 9. Good vitamin supplements should help reduce inflammation Inflammation is the root of most diseases and debility today. Your vitamin supplement should help reduce inflammation! Anti-inflammatory compounds that you should look for in a supplement are selenium from mushrooms, vitamin D from lichen, carotenoids from spinach, and peppers as good examples. A good source of vitamin B12 is from liver in some supplements. Tip: read the ingredients and look for foods you can pronounce as vitamin sources. 10. Good-quality supplements should be easy on the stomach Many people stop their vitamin supplements because they feel worse when they take them and get stomach pains and discomfort. Here are some of the reasons why: - Synthetic vitamins are usually harsher on the body than natural ones. - Low-quality minerals don't absorb well either, leaving your belly with unease. - Factory-made vitamins may create intestinal imbalances from additives and chemicals. Dietary supplements get a bad name because they make people feel bad-but they shouldn't if they are of good quality. Look for vitamins that contain natural digestive enzymes and herbs that support digestion. Tips: - You should always take your supplements with food for better absorption and to help ease your stomach. - Take your supplements in smaller, more frequent doses, at least twice a day to also be easy on the stomach.

You likely need a vitamin supplement for the following 9 reasons: - Modern agriculture has stripped the soil of vital nutrients, so our foods end up suffering as a result. - Herbicides like glyphosate reduce mineral absorption in our body, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and manganese [ [R](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/15/4/1416/htm)]. - Shipping and handling of vegetables reduce the folate content drastically by the time they get to your plate. - Vitamin C is also diminished in most produce before you eat it, including potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, and green beans. - Frozen vegetables and meats often lose vitamin and mineral content through blanching prior to freezing. - Processed foods are low in essential vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. - Sugars further deplete your vitamin stores. - Imbalances in minerals increase heavy metal uptake in the body. - Stress and medications often increase your body's demands for vitamins. - You don't get enough sunlight so you miss out on vitamin D. Why people are skeptical about vitamins We get all of our nutrients we need from food. This is false. Most Americans fall short in nutrients. Vitamin supplements are linked to improvements in quality of life, improvements in immunity, and health in many populations. Vitamins cause harm. Rarely. Vitamins almost never cause harm and if they do, the harm is reversible. The rare side effect happens if someone is taking massive doses, synthetic varieties, or has a tablet stuck in their throat. This can be prevented with using capsules or chewable vitamins [ [R](https://aapcc.org/data-system/)]. Clinical studies repeatedly show that vitamins are safe and beneficial in many conditions. Americans are often overweight, so they get too many nutrients. Also false. The Standard American Diet is calorie-rich but nutrient-poor. Vitamins don't help. False. Countless studies show that vitamins such as vitamin D supplements can be critical for a healthy immune response.
