And when it comes to helping you heal, two systems of medicine can help. Western Medicine, also called Allopathic or Conventional medicine, is the science of chemistry. Advances in this field are powerful and often used in situations that need urgent attention. For example, if you are in an accident or have a heart attack, Western Medicine can save your life. However, when it comes to disease prevention and the treatment of chronic disease, conventional medicine often leaves people with lingering symptoms. Eastern Medicine, sometimes called Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), can be thought of as the science of physics. Its focus isn't chemistry but energy, harmony, and balance. This ancient system has been around for thousands of years and works with the body as a whole to restore the function of organ systems and keep the body healthy. You wouldn't use TCM in a medical crisis, but when it comes to restoring and maintaining health TCM is powerful medicine. TCM uses many different healing modalities. Treatment is typically a combination of the following: - Acupuncture (the practice of inserting fine needles through the skin at specific points, especially to cure disease or relieve pain) - Moxibustion (the burning of herbal leaves on or near the body) - Cupping (the use of warmed glass jars to create suction on specific points of the body) - Tui Na (Massage) - Movement and concentration exercises (such as tai chi) - Herbal remedies - Nutrition Traditional Chinese Medicine: What to Expect 1 TCM Assessment MotlMD offers Traditional Chinese Medicine assessments(including pulse and tongue evaluation) as a part of every initial consultation.
