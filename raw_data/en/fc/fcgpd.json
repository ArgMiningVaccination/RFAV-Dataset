The sh\u00e9n is responsible for many functions of the human experience such as consciousness, thinking, feeling, sleep, memory, and wisdom. Disharmony in the body can disturb the sh\u00e9n, and a disturbed sh\u00e9n can create disharmony in the body. At Shen Studio, we believe it is important to treat the sh\u00e9n in every condition, as all ailments arise from a state of disharmony. Dr. Kirsten Kruse, L.Ac, DCM FOUNDER, DOCTOR OF ACUPUNCTURE & CHINESE MEDICINE EDUCATION: Doctorate of Chinese Medicine, Northwestern Health Sciences University (Valedictorian, Summa Cum Laude) Master of Acupuncture, Northwestern Health Sciences University (Valedictorian, Summa Cum Laude) Bachelor of Science in Business, University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management ACUPUNCTURE EXPERIENCE: Abbott Northwestern Hospital Courage Kenny Rehabilitation Center The Pediatric Specialty Care Journey Clinic University of Minnesota Fairview Hospital - In her previous career, Dr. Kruse worked in finance for a Fortune 500 company. She received acupuncture on a regular basis to cope with the headaches and stress that came with her misaligned career, never thinking that she would someday be an acupuncturist herself. Eventually Dr. Kruse left the spreadsheets and cubicles behind to embark on a soul-searching journey in SouthEast Asia. It was here that she decided the most worthwhile pursuit was one in service of others. Two degrees, three board exams, and many hospital rotations later, Dr. Kruse was ready to create her own acupuncture clinic. She aptly named the clinic Sh\u00e9n (translation: spirit) to reflect her passion for the radical transformations that occur when you restore harmony between the human mind, body, and spirit. Dr. Kruse believes that Traditional Chinese Medicine is equal parts art and science and that neither aspect can be ignored. There is scientific, evidence-based research that proves acupuncture elicits a positive healing response in the body. At the same time, Dr. Kruse believes there is an innate intelligence and vitality to human life that we call qi. Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine work by manipulating your qi and activating your body's innate intelligence to heal itself. Dr. Kruse finds great joy in exploring this magical intersection of science and art with her patients. Dr. Kruse spends much of her free time reading about and practicing mindfulness meditation. She brings mindfulness along with healing intention and alignment with her highest values into every treatment. The result for the patient is an amplified experience, rich with nourishment and potential. As a local resident of Northeast Minneapolis, Dr. Kruse enjoys walking the vibrant neighborhoods and taking inspiration from the power and movement of the flowing Mississippi river. She shares her home with her partner, Benjamin, and a 19-year-old cat named Midas, who grows needier by the day. Benjamin is a meditation teacher who you may see around the clinic; Midas, on the other hand, prefers to stay home. Dr. Kruse loves meeting people from all walks of life and she welcomes you with open arms and an open heart into the healing space she has created at Sh\u00e9n Acupuncture + Herbal Studio. Dr. Di Guan, L.Ac, DAOM DOCTOR OF ACUPUNCTURE & CHINESE MEDICINE EDUCATION: Doctorate of Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine, American Academy of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (Magna Cum Laude) Master of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Magna Cum Laude) Bachelor of Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine ACUPUNCTURE EXPERIENCE: First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of TCM (Tianjin, China) Anyi TCM Clinic (Tianjin, China) Green Lotus Yoga and Healing Center TCM Health Center LANGUAGES SPOKE: Mandarin, English - Growing up in the Shandong province in China, Dr. Guan was always fascinated by ancient Chinese culture and its Daoist roots. As Dr. Guan got closer to entering college, she became increasingly interested in a career in medicine. At this threshold, Dr. Guan chose to honor both of her passions and entered the long and rewarding journey into the study of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Dr. Guan spent the next eight years completing her Bachelor's degree, her Master's degree, and performing acupuncture in renowned TCM hospitals in China. Even with a world-class education already under her belt, Dr. Guan was further inspired to deepen her knowledge and pursue TCM mastery. She uprooted her life and moved to America where she was excited to experience a new culture while also completing her Doctorate degree. In practice, Dr. Guan draws inspiration from the classic texts of Daoism, Confucianism, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. She uses three fundamental theories to guide her treatments. First, the human body should be treated as a whole rather than separate, individual parts. Second, when unchecked, emotions behave pathogenetically in the body and create disease. Due to the stressful nature of our world, it is therefore of great importance to calm the spirit/mind in every patient. Third, the human body echoes the universe. Any change in nature will have a corresponding change in the body. Treatments need to be adjusted accordingly to the changing of the seasons and the phases of the moon. As a personal philosophy, Dr. Guan believes in the Golden Mean within Confucianism. One is to maintain balance and harmony by directing the mind to a state of constant equilibrium, an unwobbling pivot. As Dr. Guan brings this state of equilibrium into the treatment room, an equilibrium within the patient follows suit. Within Traditional Chinese Medicine this manifests as the perfect balance between yin and yang, bringing immense healing to the individual. Dr. Guan finds great joy in helping her patients heal their ailments through the profound wisdom of Traditional Chinese Medicine. With the mind and body balanced, her patients become a modest and gentle person with a disposition as graceful as the luster of jade. Outside of the clinic, Dr. Guan enjoys outdoor sports, reading, listening to music, and trying out new foods. She has a very cute Bichon Frise named Jerry that lives with her parents in China.
