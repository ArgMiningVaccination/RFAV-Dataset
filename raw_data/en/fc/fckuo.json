Elliott1,2Cik Yin Lee1,3Christine 15 March 2016 /C211The Author(s) 2016. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com Abstract Background Increasing numbers of older people are receiving support with medicines management from com- munity nursing services (CNSs) to enable them to live in their own homes. Little is known about these people and the support they receive. Objectives To explore the characteristics of older people referred for medicines management support, type of sup- port provided, medication errors and adverse medication events (AMEs). Methods A retrospective observational study of a random sample of 100 older people referred to a large non-prot CNS for medicines management support over a 3-month period was conducted. Measures were: demographics,referral source, current medical problems, medicines, medication aids, types of medication authorisations used by nurses, frequency of nurse visits and type of support pro- vided, medication errors, AMEs and interdisciplinary teamwork among community nurses, general practitioners and pharmacists. Results Older people (median 80 years) were referred for medicines support most often by hospitals (39 %). Other referrals were from families/carers, case-managers, palliative care services and general practitioners. Multiple health conditions (median 5) and medicines (median 10) were common; 66 % used C5 medicines; 48 % used C1 high-risk medicines\u2014most commonly opiates, anticoag- ulants and insulin. Medication aids were frequently used, mostly multi-compartment dose administration aids (47 %). Most people received regular community nurse visits ( C4 per week) to administer medicines or monitor medicine-taking. Only 16 % had a medication adminis- tration chart; for other clients nurses used medicine lists or letters from doctors for medication authorisation. Medication errors occurred in 41 % of people and 13 % hadC1 AME requiring medical consultation or hospital- isation; 9/13 (64 %) AMEs were potentially preventable. There was little evidence of interdisciplinary teamwork or medication review. Conclusion CNS clients had multiple risk-factors for medication misadventure. Deciencies in medicines man- agement were identied, including low use of medication charts and interdisciplinary medication review. Strategies are needed to improve medicines management in the home- care setting.Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s40801-016-0065-6 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. &Rohan A.

Medication errors and adverse medication events requiring medical consultation occurred in 41 and13 % of CNS clients respectively; a majority of adverse medication events were preventable. There is a need to develop and test strategies to improve medication safety for CNS clients. 1 Introduction The number of older Australians has increased by 65 % over the last 20 years [ 1]. Over the same period there has been a growing focus on supporting older people to remain living in their own homes for as long as possible [ 2], and an increase in the intensity of treatment for medical conditionsthat commonly affect older people (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis), leading to increased polypharmacy and medication regimen complexity [ 3]. Together these factors have led to increased demand for community nursing services (CNSs) to support older peo- ple with managing medicines at home [ 4]. A large Aus- tralian CNS recently reported that 56 % of its home nursing visits were primarily for the purpose of supporting medicines management [ 5]. Similar trends have been reported internationally [ 6]. There is evidence that older people receiving home nursing care are a group at high risk of medication-relatedproblems and adverse medication events (AMEs) [ 7-10]. It has been suggested that the risk of medication-related problems among CNS clients may be greater than in otherhealthcare settings such as hospitals and residential aged- care facilities because of the unstructured environment and communication challenges in the home care setting [ 11]. For example, home care nurses have a less direct rela- tionship and less contact with clients' medical practitioners and pharmacies. There may be multiple prescribers andmultiple pharmacies involved in the client's care. Pre- scribers and pharmacists may not see the client regularlyand may rely on the nurse to report medication-related problems. Home-care clients and their informal carers often participate in their own medicines management (by self-administering some medicines, attending medicalappointments, purchasing over-the-counter medicines, etc.) which means there is potential for non-adherence and medication self-administration errors [ 11,12]. Despite large numbers of people receiving CNS support, there has been little research focusing on this group [ 12, 13]. In Australia, Johnson et al. used a convenience sample of 111 CNS clients to develop medication risk assessment criteria and test a nurse-led intervention to improve med-icine use [ 7,14], and While et al. [ 15-17] conducted a series of qualitative studies exploring issues related to medicines management in CNS clients and their carers.Whilst these studies, and similar studies from other coun- tries [ 9,10,12], highlighted complexities and problems related to medicines management, they did not recruitrepresentative samples of CNS clients or report the fre- quency or type of medicines management support provided or the prevalence of medication errors and AMEs. Know-ing more about people who receive medicines management support from CNSs, the types of support they receive and medication-related problems and AMEs encountered, mayhelp with identifying areas for improvement and planning future care needs for home-care clients. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of community-dwelling older people referred to an Aus- tralian CNS for support with medicines management, their medicines management and medication errors and adversemedication events. 2 Methods 2.1 Setting The study was conducted at two metropolitan sites of a large, not-for prot CNS in Melbourne, Australia. The sitesemployed 120 registered nurses (degree-qualied nurses), nine enrolled nurses (diploma- or certicate-qualied nur- ses) and eight community care aides (non-nurse profes-sional care workers). 2.2 SubjectsOne hundred CNS clients were randomly selected (using a random number generator) from all people aged 50 yearsand over who were referred for medicines support between 16 July and 12 October 2012.14 R. A. Elliott et al.2.3 Data Collection Data were collected (May-December 2013) by retrospec- tive review of clients' CNS records and telephone contactwith clients' general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacies, using a pre-piloted data collection form. Data collected, and denitions, are provided in Table 1. Referral details, medical problems, cognitive function and use of medication aids were obtained from referral documents, CNS admission notes and care plans. Medici-nes used by clients were obtained from medication authorisations. CNS home visits, medication errors, AMEs and dis- charge location were identied by reviewing CNS progress notes and discharge records. Evidence of interdisciplinary teamwork was identied from CNS records and telephonecalls to GPs and/or community pharmacies.2.4 Data Analysis Age-adjusted Charlson Co-morbidity Index scores were calculated (a score of C5 indicates at high risk of mor- tality) [ 18]. The use of medicines associated with height- ened risk of adverse events was determined by a pharmacist researcher, who compared clients' medicinelists against a pre-dened list of 'risk' medicines (Table 1). Potential AMEs were reviewed by an expert panel to determine causality, preventability and contribution tohospital admission, using modied Hallas criteria [ 19,20]. The panel comprised three clinical pharmacists and two registered nurses, each with over 15 years of experienceencompassing hospital and community aged care. Panel members assessed each case independently. When there was disagreement, the case was discussed until consensuswas reached. Severity was assessed using Pearson criteriaTable 1 Data collected and denitions Data (denition) Source of referral to the CNSReason for referral to the CNSCurrent medical problems (active medical problems at the time of admission to the CNS)Presence of cognitive impairment (documented dementia or mild cognitive impairment, Mini-Mental State Examination score \\24 or Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale score \\23) Medicines used at the time of CNS admission (medicines listed on the clients' rst 'medication authorisation')Use of medicines associated with heightened risk of an adverse medication event if taken or administered incorrectly (high risk: anticoagulants, chemotherapeutic agents excluding hormonal agents, immunosuppressant agents, insulins, opioids; risk: oral Medication management aids used (e.g. dose administration/adherence aids)CNS visits in the rst and last weeks of the CNS admission a Types of medication authorisations (medication administration charts or other medicine lists or instructions signed by a medical practitioner authorising the CNS to administer medicines or support clients' medicine self-administration) used during rst and last weeks of admissiona Medication errors (deviations from the prescriber's instructions, whether or not they led to harm) Adverse medication events (adverse drug reactions [ADRs] requiring medical consultation and unplanned medication-related hospital admissions) Evidence of interdisciplinary teamwork (documented communication between CNS staff and prescribers or pharmacists, Home Medicines Reviews,bTeam Care Arrangements,cCase Conferencesd) Duration of CNS care (number of from CNS admission to CNS discharge)e Discharge location CNS community nursing service aFor clients who had not been discharged from the CNS at the time of the audit, the last week of admission for the purpose of data collection was taken to be the last week of available data (at least six months after admission to the CNS) bHome Medicines Review (HMR) is an Australian Government funded program that is available to patients in the community setting who are at risk of adverse medication events.

The AME assessment criteria are provided in Supplementary File 1. Data were analysed using SPSS (version 21, IBM Cor- poration, USA). Analyses were carried out using descrip- tive tests, with results reported as frequency and proportionfor categorical variables and median and interquartile range (IQR) for discrete and non-normally distributed continuous variables. 3 Results One hundred and ninety-seven people aged 50 years orover were referred for medicines support. The character- istics of the 100 clients selected for the study, and their reasons for referral, are summarised in Table 2. CNS cli- ents were visited a median of four to ve days a week. In the rst week of care the most common reason for medicines support visits was to administer medicines; inthe last week it was to monitor medicine-taking (Table 3). A minority of clients ( n=16) had a medication ad- ministration chart during the rst week of their CNSadmission; 14 of these were handwritten by a hospital doctor and two were printed or handwritten by a GP. The remaining 84 clients' treatment authorisations were printedor handwritten medicine lists provided by the client's GP (n=48), hospital doctor ( n=27), specialist ( n=1) or unknown source ( n=8). Use of medication administration charts remained low, with only 15 clients having one at the time of discharge. Twenty-two clients had more than one medication authorisation used concurrently (e.g. a GPmedicine list plus a letter from a GP or specialist indicating a medicine change) during either the rst or last week of their CNS admission. Medication authorisations for 85 clients included all of their medicines. The other 15 clients' authorisations included a partial list only (usually parenteral medicines,because the CNS was involved in administering those medicines only). The 85 clients with a complete medicine list used a median of ten medicines (IQR 6-13, range2-26), and 66 % used ve or more. The median number of regular, long-term medicines (excluding 'when required' and short-term medicines) was eight (IQR 4-11, range1-21). Forty-eight clients used one or more high risk medicines, most commonly opiates (28 % clients), anti- coagulants (17 % clients) and insulins (14 % clients). One hundred and thirty-seven medication errors were identied, affecting 41 (41 %) clients (Table 4). Twenty- three (23 %) clients had an unplanned hospital admis-sion\u2014after expert panel review 9/23 (39.1 %) of these were deemed to have been possibly medication-related(Table 5). Five clients had an ADR that required medical consultation without hospital admission. One client had both a medication-related hospital admission and an ADR without admission, so overall there were 13 (13 %) clientswith one or more AME requiring medical consultation or hospitalisation (Table 5). Nine (64 %) AMEs were con- sidered to have been potentially preventable. Eight clientsdied at home; all were receiving end-of-life care for a terminal illness prior to their death. There was little evidence of interdisciplinary teamwork. CNS nurses recorded contact with the clients' GP or pharmacy for only eight clients in the rst week of care andone in the nal week. No client had a multidisciplinary case conference documented at any time during their CNS admission, and only one client had a Team CareArrangement. One client had a Home Medicines Review (HMR) recorded in their CNS record; a further four had received an HMR according to their GP or communitypharmacist. 4 Discussion Community nursing services play a vital role in helpingfrail older people to remain living in their own homes. This is the rst study to quantify and describe medicines man- agement support and medication-related problems in arepresentative sample of older people referred to a CNS. It found that CNS clients had a very high prevalence of risk- factors for medication-related problems, including multipleco-morbidities, cognitive impairment, polypharmacy and use of medicines associated with heightened risk. CNS clients used a median of ten medicines, which is higherthan the average for community-dwelling older people [23]. In the rst week of care most clients were visited on at least 5 days, mainly to administer medicines. In the last week of care, the number of visits was slightly lower and the most common form of support was monitoring medi-cine-taking. This may reflect the fact that some clients regained independence or semi-independence, or that some of the sickest and frailest individuals, with intensive careneeds, were discharged to residential care or died. The most common form of medication authorisation used by the CNS was medicine lists provided by GPs(usually summaries printed from GPs' electronic patient records). Medication administration charts were infre- quently used, and in some cases multiple medicationauthorisations were used concurrently. Reliance on GP medicine lists, letters from GPs and specialists and multiple medication authorisations stems from difculty accessingGPs to obtain and maintain medication charts in the com- munity setting. However, use of these types of16 R. A.

It has been reported in severalstudies that GP medicine lists have a high rate of errors and discrepancies, for a variety of reasons including that the GP is often not the only prescriber and because patient recordsare not always updated when there are dose-changes and medicines ceased [ 9,24,25]. There were 26 medication errors related to discrepancies between medication autho- risations and clients' medicines (usually pharmacy-packed dose administration aids which may reflectinaccurate medication authorisations and/or deciencies in interdisciplinary communication (e.g. GP or other pre- scriber failing to notify the pharmacy of a medicine changefor a DAA client, or GP being unaware of a medicine change initiated by another prescriber). Multi-compartment DAAs were used by nearly 50 % of CNS clients. Whilst these may simplify medicines man- agement for some older people, they can also increase the cost and complexity of medicines management and there isevidence that they are sometimes used unnecessarily [ 12, 26]. In this study almost half of the clients who used a DAA were receiving CNS visits 7 days a week, and almost onequarter had their DAA stored in a locked box. It is likely that some of these clients could have been managed without a DAA since they were not self-administering their medicines. Medication errors were prevalent, with 41 % clients having one or more error identied. Almost three quarters resulted from clients (or carers) missing doses or takingmedicines incorrectly. It is not surprising that client/carer errors were common given that CNS clients were olderpeople with functional and/or cognitive decline who were referred for medicines management support, and many continued to have some involvement in taking theirmedicines (since the CNS could usually visit only once a day and medicines often needed to be taken at other times). However, it is also possible that healthcare providers and their systems contributed to some of the errors attributed to clients. For example, failure to simplify unnecessarilycomplex medication regimens or to choose the simplest dose-forms sometimes contributed to client errors. It is common practice for CNS nurses to set out the eveningdoses for clients when they visit in the morning, in order to avoid multiple daily visits, and this practice was sometimes associated with missed doses when the client forgot to takethose medicines. Medication errors caused by CNS staff were uncommon, however this is likely to be an underestimate because thesewere difcult to detect using retrospective methodology (which was largely reliant on CNS staff identifying and documenting such errors) and with low usage of medica-tion administration charts. In hospitals and residential care settings, using medication chart audits and direct obser- vation of staff administering medicines, much higher errorrates have been reported [ 27,28]. Missing the occasional dose of a medicine is unlikely to be clinically signicant for most medicines, so whilstTable 2 continued Variable Data n(%) or median (IQR); range Multi-compartment dose administration aid (DAA) 47 (47 %)f DAA packed by Community pharmacy 42Client/carer/family member 2Not documented 3 Single-compartment DAA used by CNS for setting out evening doses when nurse visited in the morning12 (12 %) Locked box used by CNS to store medicines 17 (17 %) g CNS community nursing service, DAA Dose Administration Aid aConditions included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index bLikely to be an underestimate, because only 36 % clients had a MMSE or RUDAS score documented cNumber of medicines at the time of admission to RDNS (includes regular and when required medicines; when combination products were used the individual active ingredients were counted as separate medicines).

A. Elliott et al.missed doses were the most common error, many were of minimal clinical importance. However, some errors hadpotential to cause harm, such as clients double-dosing, often due to confusion associated with the use of DAAs, clients taking an incorrect dose (including cases involvinginsulin, warfarin and prednisolone), clients potentially receiving incorrect medicines or doses as a result of inac- curate medicine lists, inter-professional communication failures, prescribing errors or dispensing errors and running out of medicines. One-third of errors involved medicinesassociated with moderate or high risk of AMEs if admin- istered incorrectly.AMEs requiring medical attention were identied in 13 % of CNS clients, including medication-related hospitaladmissions in 9 % of clients. This may be an underesti- mate, as identication of AMEs relied on CNS documen- tation. It is possible that some AMEs were not recognisedor documented by CNS nurses. A majority of AMEs were considered to be potentially preventable, which is consis- tent with studies in other populations [ 29,30]. The most common cause of AMEs was prescribing problems (Table 5).

It was not possible to accurately quantify what proportion were unintended errors versus deliberate non-adherence usingretrospective methodology; however, a large majority appeared to be errors cErrors caused by general practitioners and other prescribers, pharmacists and nurses. This includes prescribing errors, dispensing errors, administration errors and communication failures. The number of errors attributed to each of these categories could not be accurately quantied retrospectively, because oftenthe specic cause could not be determined. For example, when there was a discrepancy between themedication authorisation and the client's medicines ( n=26), it was not possible to determine whether this was due to an error on the authorisation, a dispensing/DAA packing error, or lack of communication between members of the healthcare team following a medicine change.

Interdisci-plinary collaboration is needed to enable a 'best possible medication history' and medication reconciliation [ 31]t o occur on admission to the CNS (in order to ensure that thecorrect medicine regimen is implemented and all members of the healthcare team have access to the same medicine list) [ 6,12], to increase the use of medication administra- tion charts (which enable clear documentation of medica- tion administration and improve medication safety), and tofacilitate interdisciplinary medication reviews. Despite CNS clients' high risk of AMEs, and eligibility for gov- ernment-funded interdisciplinary care services, there waslittle evidence of formal interdisciplinary collaboration in relation to medicines management. Interdisciplinary medication reviews such as HMR have been shown to identify and address medicine discrepancies, medication-related problems and inappropriate prescribing, simplify medication regimens and reduce the risk of AMEs[6,11,32-35]. The CNS involved in this study, like most CNSs, does not employ its own pharmacists or medical practitioners, so the only way for an interdisciplinarymedication review to occur is if the clients' GP initiates an HMR (nurses are not able to initiate government-fundedHMRs). The low use of HMR in this cohort is consistent with previous Australian studies in high-risk groups such as people referred to Aged Care Assessment Teams orresiding in supported accommodation [ 34,36]. Efforts to increase the uptake of HMRs, even in high-risk groups such as CNS clients, have had limited success [ 34,37], suggesting that alternative methods to facilitate interdisci- plinary medicines management are needed. One option isfor the CNS to employ clinical pharmacists to work with its nurses to undertake medication reconciliation and medici- nes reviews, and liaise with clients' GPs and communitypharmacists. A pilot study exploring the role of clinical pharmacists in a CNS is currently underway [ 38]. A limitation of our study was that it included only one metropolitan CNS. Further studies are warranted to deter- mine the extent to which these ndings are generalisable to other CNSs, in particular in rural and regional areas. Ret-rospective methodology may have led to underestimation of medicine use, medication errors, AMEs and interdisci- plinary teamwork.

A. Elliott et al.selection of subjects to obtain a sample representative of the older people referred for medicines support. Another strength was review of clients' complete CNS records, including nursing progress notes, to extract data, which islikely to have improved detection of errors and ADRs compared with reliance on spontaneous voluntary reporting by nurses. Although there has been little previous Australian research in the home nursing setting, research conducted internationally suggests that many of these issues are not unique to Australia. Studies from other countries (mainly the USA) have reported that home nursing clients oftenhave multiple medicines-related risk factors (including polypharmacy, multiple healthcare providers, poor com- munication between providers and outdated medicine lists)leading to medication errors and AMEs [ 8-10,39-41]. No Australian or international study has previously recruited a similar random sample and reported the type of medicinesmanagement support provided, so it is not possible to compare this data with other studies. 5 Conclusion Older people referred to a CNS for medicines managementsupport were a frail group of people with multiple risk- factors for AMEs. They received intensive medicinesmanagement support, often over a prolonged period. There was minimal formal interdisciplinary collaboration and infrequent medication review. Medication errors andAMEs were common. There is a need to develop and test strategies to improve medication safety for CNS clients.
