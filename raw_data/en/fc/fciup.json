Four national surveys conducted since 1990 have fou nd that at least a third of US adults routinely use complem entary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies to treat their principal medical conditions. All four surveys documented the fact that each year Americans schedule hundreds of millions o f office visits to licensed complementary and alternative he althcare pro- fessionals at a cost of tens of billions of dollars , most of which is paid for out-of-pocket. The most recent national su rvey pub- lished by the Centers for Disease Control (NHIS 200 7) reported that out-of-pocket expenditures associated with com plementary and alternative healthcare practices account for ap proximately 12% of all out-of-pocket health care expenditures i n the United States. The discovery of this \"hidden mainstream\" o f American health care is no longer disputed. These national surveys have also confirmed that the majority of patients who use complementary and alternative m edical therapies generally do not disclose or discuss them with their primary care physicians or subspecialists. This lac k of interdisci- plinary communication is not in a patient's best in terest. Making matters more complicated, it is also known that amo ng individuals who use CAM therapies, the majority ten d to use multiple CAM practices as opposed to a single modal ity to treat their medical problems. Regrettably, many individua ls seek combinations of conventional and complementary ther apies in a non-coordinated rather than an integrated fashion. vi | Preface The Institute of Medicine, in its report Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States , has helped set the stage for future research in this area. The report states : Studies show that patients frequently do not limit them- selves to a single modality of care - they do not s ee complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional medicine as being mutually exclusive - and this pattern will probably continue and may even ex pand as evidence of therapies' effectiveness accumu- late. Therefore, it is important to understand how CAM and conventional medical treatments (and providers) in- teract with each other and to study models of how t he two kinds of treatments can be provided in coordinated ways. In that spirit, there is an urgent need for health systems research that focuses on identifying the elements o f these integrative medical models, their outcomes and whet her these are cost effective when compared to conventio nal practice. \u2014Institute of Medicine Report on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the US National Academy of Sciences, 2005 In this era of cost containment and healthcare refo rm, in addition to the development of patient centered med ical homes and accountable care organizations, this recommenda tion needs to become a priority. In order to design and implem ent such studies, however, we must first define and describe each of the relevant CAM modalities and professional groups in order to establish standards that lend themselves to reprodu cible research. Moreover, referrals between professional communities and the training of multidisciplinary teams consist ing of both conventional and complementary care practitioners c annot begin Preface | vii unless and until all participating professional gro ups learn more about one another. This Clinicians' and Educators' Desk Reference on the Li censed Complementary and Alternative Healthcare Profession s contributes enormously to the goal of designing, testing, and r efining models of multidisciplinary, comprehensive, integra tive care. It thoughtfully yet concisely describes each of the ma jor complementary and alternative healthcare profession s. This information will be useful to patients, healthcare professionals, educators, students, and those responsible for futu re clinical research and healthcare policy. The Academic Consor tium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care is to be commended for making this information readily avail able. There is a Chinese proverb which reads, \"The method s used by one will be faulty. The methods used by many wil l be better.\" Over the next decade, let us test this idea, collab oratively and with all the scientific rigor, clinical expertise, and integrity we have to offer. The next generation will surely than k us. David Eisenberg, MD Associate Professor, Harvard School of Public Healt h Executive Vice President for Health Education and R esearch, Samueli Institute Former Chair, Division of Research and Education in Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies, Harvard Medical School Foreword Foreword Foreword Foreword This handbook is arriving on the healthcare scene i n the midst of tumultuous debate about reforms in the US health sy stem. As such, it contributes to the dialogue in a substanti ve way by providing, logically and clearly, well-organized de scriptions of the major complementary healthcare professions. Three issues received considerable attention in a r ecent Institute of Medicine Summit on Integrative Medicin e and the Health of the Public (February 2009): The US has an inadequate primary care workforce. Increasingly, there is recognition that there are l icensed CAM practitioners who are prepared to be the first poin t of entry for many patients. There are also advanced practice nurses who can serve as primary care providers. Current wo rkforce planning needs to take into account a broader range of providers. There was also considerable discussion regarding th e need to re-orient the system from one that focuses on disea se to one that also promotes health. CAM providers have much to contribute in both health promotion and disease tre atment. Given the complexity of disease and the multiple ch allenges to human health, rarely can one provider meet all o f the physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual n eeds of a patient. A team approach that takes into account th e capacities of a full range of providers, including CAM practitioners, is critical. We believe that the time is right for a well-planne d and deliberate strategy to integrate CAM practitioners into the x | Foreward nation's healthcare system. These providers are wel l positioned to focus on prevention, lifestyle change, health co aching, and management of certain chronic diseases and painful conditions. This type of integration has the potential to incre ase quality while decreasing costs of health care. This handbook offers an orientation for the healthc are teams of the future. Many conventional providers simply d o not know enough about the training, scope of practice, and e vidence supporting many of the complementary therapies and practitioners described here. This book helps to br idge that information gap. In the future, we would like to see more practical and detailed descriptions of interdisciplinary team collaboratio ns between physicians, advanced practice nurses, physician ass istants, and physical therapists from the conventional medical w orld and the CAM practitioners listed in this handbook. The proc esses facilitating referral, interdisciplinary communicat ion, and team building are perhaps the topic of a follow-up handb ook that will be essential for the next phase of evolution into t rue interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary healthcare teams. As members of the Consortium of Academic Health Cen ters for Integrative Medicine, our work has involved beg inning the process of bringing mainstream medicine, nursing, a nd allied health professionals into a positive relationship w ith complementary therapies and disciplines. Much remai ns to be done in these areas. However, the benefit of a handbook such as this one is that it creates a common ground in which patient-centered c are is central and in which respect for others with profes sional skills and perspectives different from our own is encourag ed. We see this type of publication as a helpful textbook and reference not only to the CAM community but to the conventional h ealthcare professions as well. Foreword | xi Victor S.

The authors described the context of emerging integration behind the IOM exploration and the \"overarching rubric\" that should guide the integrat ion of these practices with conventional medicine: The level of integration of conventional medicine a nd complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therap ies is growing. That growth generated the need for tool s or frameworks to make decisions about which therapies should be provided or recommended, about which CAM providers to whom conventional medical providers mi ght refer patients, and the organizational structure to be used for the delivery of integrated care. The committee believes that the overarching rubric that should be used to guide the development of these tools should be the goal o f providing comprehensive care that is safe and effec tive, that is collaborative and interdisciplinary, and th at respects and joins effective interventions from all sources. \u2014Institute of Medicine Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the Unite d States National Academy of Sciences, 2005, p. 216 We offered the 2009 edition of this book in the spi rit of the IOM rubric expressed here. This book is also intend ed for use by 2 | Introduction well-educated consumers of health care who are freq uently building their own teams of clinicians from a varie ty of health professions. We publish this second edition to keep the informat ion current, and in the context of the exciting, hopefu l, and relatively recent movement for interprofessional practice and education that has arisen since. The vision and mission of th e Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC) since the founding of the organization as a multidisciplinary initiative has articulated our co mmitment to a healthcare system based in appropriate team care. Vision Vision Vision Vision ACCAHC envisions a healthcare system that is multidisciplinary and enhances competence, mutual respect and collaboration across all healthcare dis ciplines. This system will deliver effective care that is pat ient centered, focused on health creation and healing, a nd readily accessible to all populations. Mission Mission Mission Mission The mission of ACCAHC is to enhance the health of individuals and communities by creating and sustain ing a network of global educational organizations and age ncies, which will promote mutual understanding, collaborat ive activities and interdisciplinary healthcare educati on. ACCAHC is pleased to be involved with multiple nati onal and global projects related to this promotion of te amwork for the benefit of the patient and the public. These includ e: development of appropriate competencies for practice, education and research; sponsorship of, and participation in, the new Institute of Medicine Global Forum on Innovation in Health Pr ofessional Education; involvement in the Collaboration Across Borders Introduction | 3 conferences; a steering committee role and active e ngagement in a national campaign to promote an integrated approa ch to pain treatment; and most recently, participating in the new Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education. Our work focuses on the five licensed complementary and alternative healthcare professions, the members of which are providing the lion's share of integration of comple mentary and alternative medicine (CAM) among community provider s, in clinics and hospitals, insurance and healthcare ben efit designs, research and educational grants, government program s, and academic centers throughout the United States. The five are acupuncture and Oriental medicine, chiropractic, ma ssage therapy, direct-entry midwifery, and naturopathic m edicine. These professions have all achieved an advanced lev el of regulatory maturity, including attaining the import ant professional benchmark of earning United States Dep artment (Secretary) of Education recognition for the agenci es that accredit their educational institutions. These five complementary healthcare disciplines represent roughly 375,000 pr actitioners nationwide. In order to support expanded understanding, informe d referrals, and choices across the entire integrativ e practice domain, we also offer information on the related fi elds of yoga therapy, holistic medicine, holistic nursing, integ rative medicine, homeopathy, and Ayurvedic medicine. These related i ntegrative practice fields were chosen based on their particip ation in the 2005 National Education Dialogue to Advance Integra ted Health Care. Together, the practitioners from the licensed CAM professions and related fields represent the integr ative healthcare professionals whom a practitioner is mos t likely to encounter in developing a more integrated team of c ommunity resources for patients. They are also the integrati ve practice 4 | Introduction professionals who may be seeing the patients of man y conventional providers, with or without their knowl edge. We are pleased to witness the excitement and acclai m with which this book was received by many educators and reviewers across multiple disciplines. At the same time, we w ere surprised that the book's use in program curricula has thus f ar, while growing, been limited. In an effort to increase use of the book in program curricula, we are making sample curriculum available to academic programs on our website. To make sure t hat neither format nor price is an obstacle to use of the book, we are making this edition of the CEDR freely available in a down loadable PDF format. Hard copies are available for purchase for those who wish them. The book also includes a companion slide show for educators that is available via the ACCAHC website We hope that this book, in its new form and in our future editions, continues to be a useful \"tool and framew ork\", in the words of the IOM text, not only to \"make decisions about CAM providers to whom conventional medical providers mi ght refer patients\", but also to ensure that members of the d istinct disciplines whose practices are portrayed here are well informed about each other. Supporting Multidisciplinary Care: A Focus on Supporting Multidisciplinary Care: A Focus on Supporting Multidisciplinary Care: A Focus on Supporting Multidisciplinary Care: A Focus on Practitioners Rather than Modalities Practitioners Rather than Modalities Practitioners Rather than Modalities Practitioners Rather than Modalities In this era in which the need to focus on wellness, health promotion and disease prevention for better treatme nt of chronic disease dominates the healthcare reform dialogue, multidisciplinary teams form the foundation of most of the significant new clinical models. A team approach to health care provides higher patient satisfaction and better hea lth care, and reduces costs. Advocates of the chronic care model, of prospective health care, of the medical home, of in tegrative medicine, and of functional medicine, all promote a n Introduction | 5 increasingly multidisciplinary medicine. The moveme nts for interprofessional practice and education and integr ated pain care are similarly focused. Success in such teams b egins with quality information about the skills and background of potential contributors from diverse professions. Practitioners of all types tend to be educated in s ilos. We have a saying in the Academic Consortium for Complementa ry and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC) that \"those who ar e educated together practice together.\" If we wish to develop a patient-centered healthcare system, then we must br eak out of these isolated silos and learn more about one anoth er. This book is distinguished by its focus on practiti oners and their philosophies. Our authors explore approaches to patients, education, accreditation, scopes of practice, and p rofessional developments. We worked with key national education al organizations to select authors whose rich experien ce as clinicians and educators would inform the writing. We believe that in this day and age when patients are putting together their own healthcare teams, that all healthcare professio nals have the ethical responsibility to become more educated abou t the licensed CAM fields. This orientation is in contra-distinction to most e ducation and publications relative to complementary and alternat ive practices. Past contributions relative to \"complementary and a lternative medicine\" (CAM) focused mainly on individual agents , modalities, or therapies. Insufficient attention ha s been given to exploration of the whole practices of these discipl ines and the systems of care that the distinctly licensed CAM pr actitioners are educated to provide. Too often, the portraits of th ese professions, when they are offered, come from outside observers rather than from those with personal experience as practitioner s. The historically limited focus of most texts target ing multidisciplinary audiences does a disservice to bo th practitioners and consumers. A description of a sin gle natural 6 | Introduction therapy, for instance, will not teach about the con text in which it is offered by an actual practitioner. The reader wi ll not encounter the profession's distinct approach to pat ients, the depth of the professional education which informs i t, and the sometimes surprising scopes of practice that underl ie it. Approaches may include conventional and nonconventi onal diagnostic strategies, together with diverse treatm ents from their own disciplines. In addition, a reductive focus on CAM therapies for specific diseases, such as a botanical or the use of acupunc ture needles, does not teach a community practitioner that the he althcare disciplines portrayed in this book tend also to emp hasize preventive medicine, the practitioner-patient relat ionship, the promotion of wellness, and the teaching of self-car e practices. As became abundantly clear through the ACCAHC project on these disciplines and primary care, these practitioners t end also to be \"first choice\" or \"first access\" providers for the patients who come to these. These disciplines reflect whole syst ems of care rather than more limited modalities or therapies. T he loss of knowledge and skills in using a reductive focus can be significant. An excellent perspective on potential problems is provided by the IOM report on CAM cited above: Although some conventional medical practices may se ek and achieve a genuine integration with various CAM therapies, the hazard of integration is that certai n CAM therapies may be delivered within the context of a conventional medical practice in ways that dissocia te CAM modalities from the epistemological framework that guides the tailoring of the CAM practice. If this o ccurs, the healing process is likely to be less effective or e ven ineffective, undermining both the CAM therapy and t he conventional biomedical practice. This is especiall y the case when the impact or change intended by the CAM Introduction | 7 therapy relies on a notion of efficacy that is not readily measurable by current scientific means. (p. 175) A modality or therapy orientation also falls short in assisting students, educators, and clinicians to understand h ow to communicate with and work in teams with other pract itioners, and renders a disservice to consumers as well. Pati ents are too often treated by professionals who have neither the knowledge nor comfort to work well with members of these comp lementary healthcare professions who may offer what will serv e the patient best. This book, while foundational, is also theref ore remedial. Additional Context for this Book Additional Context for this Book Additional Context for this Book Additional Context for this Book We have taken a perspective that is part of a broad er shift in the integrative practice and CAM dialogue, just as it i s part of the heightened focus on interprofessional practice and education in the broader health reform effort. In 2005, for inst ance, the Con- sortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM), consisting now of 54 member institutions, changed its operating definition of integrative medicine. T he amended definition emphasizes the importance of integrating not only \"modalities\" but also \"healthcare professionals and disciplines.\" (See the Definition of Integrative Medicine at www.imconsortium.org/about/home.htm.) Notably, the inter- professional education movement stresses that \"egal itarianism\" is a core characteristic of the model that infuses optimal team care. All disciplines may not contribute equally to a patient's care but the relationship between them is one of re spect for what each brings to the patient. This is a core ACCAHC v alue. The commitment of educators and accreditation offic ials from the five licensed disciplines featured in this book to form ACCAHC as an independent organization is also evide nce of the emerging multidisciplinary universe. While the arti fact called 8 | Introduction \"CAM\" neatly bundled these distinct disciplines int o a group, in truth, these professions also emerged in separate s ilos and each offers a distinct approach to health care. ACCAHC r epresents the growing recognition of leaders in these fields that their stu- dents are increasingly entering an era that values knowledge and skills in multidisciplinary teams. Membership i n ACCAHC reflects a commitment to developing new knowledge, skills, and attitudes that promote collaboration and patient-ce ntered health care. The research environment also offers evidence of th is shift toward broader dialogue from the limited focus on t he use of individual agents. Attendees of the 2009 North Amer ican Re- search Conference on Complementary and Integrative Medicine, the most significant research meeting for integrati ve practice, witnessed a noticeable increase in program content relative to whole systems of care, patient-centered outcomes in care that focus on the whole person, and the challenges in ca pturing out- comes of actual practices. (See www.cahcimabstracts .com.) The 2011-2015 Strategic Plan of the National Institutes of Health Na- tional Center for Complementary and Alternative Med icine (NCCAM), marks a shift toward effectiveness researc h and real world outcomes. The ACCAHC-NCCAM dialogue successfu lly supported elevation of the importance of researchin g the impact of healthcare disciplines on populations. (See ACCA HC Research Working Group Led Communication with NIH NCCAM on the 2011-2015 Strategic Plan: (http://accahc.org/images/stories/2011-15_strat_pla n.pdf) This refocusing of the integration dialogue is also reflected in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (201 0). That law directly includes \"licensed complementary and alter native medicine practitioners\", and \"integrative health pr actitioners\" and \"integrative health\" in sections related to wor kforce, medi- cal homes, prevention and health promotion, patient -centered outcomes research and, indirectly, in a requirement for non-dis-Introduction | 9 crimination among provider types in health plans. T he language establishing a new focus on wellness and prevention is aligned with the health orientation and wellness principles of the licensed CAM professions and related integrative pr actice disciplines. We believe that the time is ripe for this practical desk reference. We have organized this book to facilitat e ready access to useful information. We continue in this introduc tion with some general information on the five licensed compl ementary healthcare professions. This leads directly into th e chapters from each of these five licensed integrative healthcare professions. Similar information on the six related integrative practice fields is found in later chapters. We share additional inf ormation about ACCAHC in appendices. We include some accomplishmen ts since ACCAHC was founded as a project of the Integr ative Healthcare Policy Consortium (www.ihpc.org) in 2004 . Given ACCAHC's organizational structure and focus as an interprofessional practice, we provide a look at so me of the collaborative, interprofessional activity with whic h we are proud to be involved. Da Da Da Data on the Licensed Complementary Healthcare ta on the Licensed Complementary Healthcare ta on the Licensed Complementary Healthcare ta on the Licensed Complementary Healthcare Professions Professions Professions Professions As noted above, the five licensed complementary hea lthcare professions have each distinguished themselves by a chieving certain benchmarks of professional development. The se benchmarks include creating councils of colleges or schools, finding agreement on consistent national educationa l standards, establishing an accrediting agency, and then earnin g recognition of the accrediting agency by the US Department (Sec retary) of Education. Each achievement marks a stage of matura tion. In addition, each of these licensed professions has also created a national certifying or testing agency, wh ich is 10 | Introduction important to the public and to state regulators as the profession begins the long process of promoting licensing in e ach state. To expand licensing, initial groups of practitioners i n each state formed state associations, mustered political skill s and courage, and created coalitions of supportive patients and c onsumers to mobilize members of one legislature after another t o enact licensing statutes for these professions.

Members of these disciplines are able to meet core credentialing standards for participation in conventional payment and delivery systems. Table 1.1 provides data on the st atus of each profession in these benchmarking processes.

Partnerships with National Organizations for Conten t Partnerships with National Organizations for Conten t Partnerships with National Organizations for Conten t Partnerships with National Organizations for Conten t Many questions arise when considering a publication to describe a number of disparate professions. How can one most equitably develop a respectful and useful resource? Who shoul d be charged with authoring the chapters? How can we ens ure balance and accuracy? We chose to address these questions by working with and through authors selected by leading national educat ional organizations affiliated with the five professions. For the core chapters we contacted the councils of colleges and schools that are organizational members of ACCAHC. For direct-en try midwifery, we worked with that profession's accredi ting agency. While these organizations helped us identify author s with whom we worked to completion of the book, the partner or ganizations did not endorse the content of this section, their chapters, or the book as a whole. For the related integrative practice fields, we sec ured authors who were selected by the leading professional organ ization in the field. For integrative medicine, which is not y et a profession per se, we worked with the Consortium of Academic H ealth Centers for Integrative Medicine.

The content was reviewed by an internal editing team an d also by the authors from the other disciplines. If any revi ewer felt that another discipline had overstated its value, for in stance, the chapter authors were asked to make edits or make th eir case stronger. Numerous changes were made during this re view process. Collaboration: The Birthing Collaboration: The Birthing Collaboration: The Birthing Birthing of this Book and the Ho pe of this Book and the Hope of this Book and the Hope of this Book and the Hope for Its Future for Its Future for Its Future for Its Future We offer this book as a tool to facilitate greater understanding and collaboration between well-informed practitione rs, educators and students, and to support better healt h care for patients. Respectful collaboration has been our vis ion and mission since ACCAHC was first conceived. The Appen dix of this book shares some advances in cross-disciplinar y education and practice over the past half-decade in which ACC AHC has been proud to be involved. This book also represents collaboration with donors and with organizations that enhance our ability to fulfill o ur mission. We are deeply grateful to Lombard, Illinois-based N ational University of Health Sciences (NUHS-www.nuhs.edu) f or a significant project grant which allowed us to bring this multi- year project to completion in the 2009 edition. Spe cifically, we thank James Winterstein, DC, president of NUHS for his support for this grant. NUHS has programs in four of the li censed professions discussed here: chiropractic medicine, acupuncture and Oriental medicine, naturopathic medicine, and m assage therapy. ACCAHC also thanks the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (www.ccaom.org) f or a 2007 contribution that supported initial work on th is project. Introduction | 15 Critical financial support which nurtured ACCAHC th rough this gestational process has come from Lucy Gonda, who is, in essence, an ACCAHC co-founder. Her vision and phila nthropic support gave us our first boost into life in 2003. She continues to provide key support for our mission including signi ficant contributions in 2011 that allowed us to place the first edition of this book in the hands of leading educators in inte rprofessional education across North America. Joining Gonda in th e ACCAHC Sustaining Donors Group which supported relationshi p development and staff time for this book are the We streich Foundation, the Leo S. Guthman Fund, NCMIC Foundati on, Bastyr University and Life University. We thank, in particular, Ruth Westreich, Lynne Rosenthal, Lou Sportelli, DC, Daniel Church, PhD, and Guy Riekeman, DC respectively, for their decisions to move these organizations to back this work. Finally, this book is now in its second edition. We anticipate that our collaborators from the councils of college s and schools and the professional organizations will continue to have ideas about how to enhance their chapters once they see t he book in print. We would like to hear from you about how we can make this book and accompanying materials more useful. I deas can be sent to info@accahc.org. The publication of the second edition of this book comes amidst a new era of interprofessional respect and p ractice. More individuals, educators and health systems are reali zing that optimal team care means widening the circle of invo lved professionals. Thanks to each of you for your own c ommitment to expanding your educational or clinical horizons to better understand and respect members of these disciplines . Patients will thank us all for it.

Since the 1970s, AOM has experi enced increasing popularity in the US. The philosophy of this ancient therapeutic system i s based on the concept of qi (simplified) or (traditional), pronounced \"chee\", meaning energy/life force, and its flow thr ough the body along channels or meridians. This ancient medicine, which can interface well with conventional medicine, has its own nomenclature, physiology, pathology, and therapeuti cs, which create a complex system of medicine documented in c lassical and modern texts. Practitioners, educators, and national AOM organiza tions seek to promote a variety of complementary goals. T hese include: standards of excellence, competence, and i ntegrity in the practice of the profession; public safety; exce llence in AOM education; high quality care; integration of AOM into the US healthcare system; chronic disease amelioration; a preventive health measure, especially as it impacts public hea lth involvement; and assistance to communities affected by disaster, war, conflict, and poverty. Another goal of the AOM community of leaders is to provide evidence as to the efficac y and safety of acupuncture, Chinese herbology and Asian bodywork t herapy through research and education. Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Prior to the 1970s, AOM was practiced in the US wit hin Asian communities that arose after the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1840s. Acupuncture Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 21 experienced a renaissance in the US in the early 19 70s. Interest was heightened when James Reston, a newspaper colum nist for the New York Times , wrote an article about the benefits of acupuncture he received during his recovery from an appendectomy in China when former President Nixon m ade his historic visit to China in 1971 1. The following four major acupuncture institutions were formed in the early 1 980s: Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Orient al Medicine (ACAOM), the US Department of Education- recognized national accrediting organization for AO M schools American Association of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (AAAOM), the national professional associa tion of AOM Practitioners Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Med icine (CCAOM), the voluntary national membership associat ion for AOM schools National Certification Commission for Acupuncture a nd Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM), the national testing an d certification organization for certifying competenc y of AOM practitioners. There are approximately 27,000 to 29,000 licensed AOM practitioners throughout the US. The average (gross ) income earned by licensed acupuncturists is $60,000; howev er, it is not uncommon for practitioners to earn in excess of thi s amount, with reported salaries in some instances exceeding $100,000. 2 In 2011, there were approximately 8,000 students en rolled in AOM programs in the US. 3 In the early years of the profession in the US, students were primarily those looking for a second career. Increasingly, students today are looking to the AOM field as a first career. Although many of the graduates e ntering the AOM profession go into solo practice, there are inc reasing 22 | Section I numbers in integrated healthcare delivery organizat ions, such as outpatient clinics, hospitals, and community clinic s. Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Treatments provided by AOM practitioners identify a pattern or multiple patterns of disharmony within a patient an d redress that disharmony in a variety of ways that may inclu de any or all of the tools of Oriental medicine. AOM seeks to ach ieve balance by restoration of the harmonious movement of qi through the application of opposite energetic forces (e.g., cle ar heat through administration of cooling herbal formulas or acupun cture points specifically noted for their ability to release hea t from the body) or through the strengthening of weak or deficient a reas. The AOM practitioner typically proceeds by observing si gns and symptoms that comprise a pattern of disharmony and one's constitutional state, rather than by developing a b iomedical diagnosis based on etiologic assessments. AOM is us ed for chronic disease, prevention and wellness, and acute care. Treatments provided by AOM practitioners are approp riate for in-depth individual care as well as for simultaneou s treatment of large groups of people, such as treatment of emerge ncy care workers at the site of the 9/11disaster and Hurrica ne Katrina, drug users in addiction recovery groups, and vetera ns suffering from PTSD. In addition, acupuncture is now utilized on the battlefield for pain control and a recent movement has seen many practitioners focus on delivering services in community treatment rooms. Practitioners of AOM approach patients from a holis tic perspective. They take into account all aspects of their health, recognizing the interconnectedness of the mind, emo tions, and body, as well as the environment. When qi is stagnant or out of balance, which can result from natural, physical or emotional Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 23 causes, illness and premature aging can occur. Orie ntal medicine involves a variety of techniques to restore balance to qi that has become stagnant or imbalanced, including acupunctur e and related therapies (various needle techniques and to ols, cupping, gwa sha (or scraping technique), moxibustion, modern use of electrical stimulation and cold laser therapy; Asia n forms of massage such as acupressure, shiatsu, and tui na; h erbal medicine; exercise ( tai qi and qi gong ); Oriental dietary therapy; and meditation. Unique methods of diagnosis include the ability to interpret topography of the tongue, palpation of pulse and acupuncture points, and extensive observation and interpretation of all bodily symptoms and physical features according to Oriental medical physiology and diagno stic criteria. This medicine is used to treat a broad range of ill nesses ranging from rehabilitation and pain management to virally mediated disorders and neurological complaints. There are se veral styles of Oriental medicine, including Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Worsley/5-element theory, Japanese meridian theory, French Energetics, and Korean hand therapy. Practitioners generally spend a significant amount of time developing a collaborative relationship with their patients, assisting them in maintaining their health and prom oting a consciousness of wellness. AOM may be especially ap propriate for reducing healthcare costs and improving access to care. 4 It is also very safe, resulting in very rare unintended e vents. 5 Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice The scope of practice for AOM varies from state to state. In state statutes acupuncture is frequently defined as the stimulation of certain points on or near the surface of the human body by the insertion of needles to prevent or modify the perception of p ain, to normalize physiological functions, or to treat certain diseas es or dysfunctions of the body . A number of state statutes also reference the energetic aspect of acupuncture by noting its usefulness in c ontrolling and 24 | Section I regulating the flow and balance of qi in the body or in normalizing energetic physiological function. Other state statutes may define acupuncture by reference to tra ditional or modern Chinese or Oriental medical concepts or to m odern techniques of diagnostic evaluation. State laws may also specifically authorize acupunct ure licensees to employ a wide panoply of AOM therapies such as moxibustion, cupping, Oriental or therapeutic massa ge, therapeutic exercise, electro-acupuncture, acupress ure, dietary recommendations, herbal therapy, injection and lase r therapy, ion cord devices, magnets, qi gong , and massage. The treatment of animals, the ordering of western diagnostic test s and the use of homeopathy are, with limitations, within the sco pe of practice in some states. Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices AOM practitioners receive training in biomedicine, including training on appropriate referrals to medical practi tioners. Some states specify the process for referral, but in mos t cases medical referral is determined by the AOM practitioner. Con versely, patients seeking AOM practitioners are mostly self- referred or referred by word of mouth. Patients may be referred to professional acupunctur ists for a variety of complaints. In 2003, a World Health Orga nization study, Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Cont rolled Clinical Trials, cited over 43 conditions that are treatable with acupuncture. While the list below is not comprehensive, it represents the typical array of complaints for whic h referral to an acupuncturist is quite appropriate: pain management, including musculoskeletal pain, rheumatologic or oncological pain, headache/migrain e, and pain palliation at end of life Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 25 neurogenic pain, including neuropathy associated wi th diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy, and the neuropathy associated with antiretroviral therapy women's health, including dysmenorrhea, premenstrua l syndrome, amenorrhea, infertility, and pain associa ted with endometriosis nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and postoperative naus ea symptoms associated with virally mediated disorders , including HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, and the p ain associated with herpes zoster and herpes simplex I and II neurological disorders, including Bell's palsy, cer ebral vascular accident, and multiple sclerosis routine infections such as colds and flu dermatological complaints, such as dermatitis and P soriasis gastrointestinal complaints, including gastralgia, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrom e, and gastroesophageal reflux disease respiratory complaints, including mild to moderate asthma, shortness of breath, and cough urogenital complaints, including dysurea, cystitis, and impotence mild to moderate anxiety and depression chemical dependency, including abuse of opiates and sympathomimetics fatigue secondary to chronic illness, medical treat ment, or surgery health issues related to aging and imbalance: kidne y disease, heart disease, diabetes cancer-related issues such as pain and the side-eff ects of chemotherapy 26 | Section I Third Third Third Third----party payers party payers party payers party payers Increasingly, acupuncture is covered in many insura nce plans, is reimbursed by other third-party payers for certain conditions, and is a part of many employer programs. For the mo st part, however, payments to individual providers are made by the patient. Indeed, AOM has grown within the US throug h word of mouth and referrals based on successful treatments and is increasingly recognized as a safe, effective medici ne in a wide variety of settings including general health care, integrative medical practices, hospitals, spas and medispa prac tices, sports and fitness gyms, nonprofit community clinics, and addiction and recovery programs. 5,6,7 There remains, however, a significant disparity in traditional insurance coverage compare d to other healthcare professions that have been established i n the mainstream world of insurance reimbursement for sev eral decades. Legislation requiring the coverage of acupuncture s ervices under federal Medicare and the Federal Employee Ben efits Program (FEBP) has been introduced in Congress for a number of years. The enactment of this legislation has lon g enjoyed significant support from within and outside of the profession. Of the 12 insurance plans in the FEBP (see Resources f or list of plans), eleven (all but Aetna), offered acupuncture benefits in 2012 covering a significant portion of the federal workforce. Additionally, there is increasing utilization of ac upuncture by programs funded by the Department of Defense for ac tive duty personnel and by the Department of Veterans Affairs , and some states have included acupuncture as an Essential He alth Benefit. Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Interest in training that prepares AOM students to work in integrative healthcare settings is high among Counc il of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM)'s 51 A OM Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 27 member institutions. A substantial number of these colleges offer internships in off-site clinics where AOM services are provided in local communities. These clinics include a varie ty of settings, including hospitals, multi-specialty centers, resea rch-based centers, public health clinics, long- and short-term rehabilitation centers, family practice clinics, nursing homes, ou tpatient geriatric or assisted living centers for seniors, d rug treatment centers, HIV/AIDS treatment facilities, sports medi cine clinics, pediatric, cancer, and other specialty care centers , and clinics addressing specific community group needs, such as women's health and inner city/low income/multi-racial group s. In addition, CCAOM, NCCAOM, and the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (A CAOM) actively participate in the work of the Academic Co nsortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC) whose work, in collaboration with leaders from convention al medical educational institutions, has focused on developing strategies for integrating conventional and CAM education. Educa Educa Educa Education tion tion tion Schools and programs Schools and programs Schools and programs Schools and programs The first acupuncture school in the US was establis hed in 1975. In 1982 the Council of Colleges of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (CCAOM) was founded as a nonprofit, volunt ary membership association for AOM colleges and program s. Currently the membership of the CCAOM consists of 5 1 member schools, all of which have achieved accreditation, or are candidates for accreditation with ACAOM, the nation al accrediting agency for AOM schools. This membership is spread over 20 states, with major concentrations of colleg es in California, New York, and Florida. There is signifi cant diversity in the programs among CCAOM's member schools with representation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine, Japanese, 28 | Section I Five Element, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions. Th e growth of CCAOM since the early years of its founding, when t here were fewer than 12 member schools, has mirrored the gene ral growth of the profession. The mission of CCAOM is to advan ce AOM by promoting educational excellence in the field. One of the goals supporting the mission of CCAOM is to take a leadership role in acupuncture safety through pub lication, education, and delivery of a national needle safety course. Pursuant to this goal, the Council's Clean Needle T echnique (CNT) course is taught to AOM students to ensure th at there is a national standard of needle safety protocol in the interest of public safety. Verification of successful completio n of the Council's CNT course, as evidenced by issuance of a certificate by the Council, is required for a person to receive Diplomate status from NCCAOM. The Executive Committee of the CCAOM consists of ei ght officers who are full-time presidents, CEOs, progra m directors, or other administrators at CCAOM's member schools. The full CCAOM meets twice each year in conferences that pro vide a forum for member institutions to dialogue about iss ues of importance to the colleges. In addition, CCAOM's me etings provide an opportunity for its many committees to m eet face-to- face and for the membership to benefit from panel d iscussions, strategic planning, and specialized workshops. Curriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum content The entry-level standard of training and education for the profession is the master's degree, which is typical ly a 3-4 year program that offers either the first-professional m aster's degree or the first-professional master's level certificat e or diploma. Under ACAOM's national accreditation standards, AOM institutions that offer a master's degree in acupun cture must be at least 3 academic years in length and provide a m inimum of 1905 hours of a professional acupuncture curriculum over a Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 29 three-year period (typically taken over four calend ar years). The curriculum for an acupuncture program must consist of at least 705 didactic hours in Oriental medical theory, diag nosis, and treatment techniques in acupuncture and related stu dies; 660 hours in clinical training; 450 hours in biomedical clinical sciences; and 90 hours in counseling, communication , ethics and practice management. A professional Oriental medicine curriculum, which is a minimum of four academic years and includes trainin g in acupuncture and the additional study of Chinese her bal medicine, must consist of at least 2625 hours leadi ng to a master's degree or master's level certificate or di ploma in Oriental medicine. The curriculum for an Oriental m edicine program must consist of at least 705 hours in Orien tal medical theory, diagnosis, and treatment techniques in acup uncture and related studies; 450 hours in didactic Oriental her bal studies; 870 hours in integrated acupuncture and herbal clinical training; 510 hours in biomedical clinical sciences; and 90 hours in counseling, communication, ethics, and practice management. For some years, there has been an ongoing dialogue within the profession concerning the amount of academic tr aining a person needs to practice AOM at the entry level and what the most appropriate professional title should be for p roviders. This dialogue has been formally focused within a doctora l task force established by ACAOM, whose work is discussed in mo re detail in this chapter under the heading of Accreditation. The average number of academic hours of study and training asso ciated with the entry-level Master's degree among AOM colleges nationally is between 2,700 and 2,900 hours. A significant num ber of Oriental medicine programs have a curriculum of 3,0 00 hours or more. The trend over the years has been for an incr ease in the number of academic hours. As of the May of 2013, ACAOM had approved nine coll eges to offer postgraduate clinical doctoral programs on a pilot basis 30 | Section I (six have achieved accreditation and three had cand idacy status for this degree). The degree for this program, titl ed Doctorate in Acupuncture & Oriental Medicine (DAOM), provides ad vanced training in either acupuncture or in Oriental medic ine. DAOM programs must provide advanced didactic and clinica l training in one or more clinical specialty areas in AOM. Com pletion of a master's degree or master's level program in acupun cture or in Oriental medicine is a prerequisite for admission i nto a DAOM program. Such programs must comprise a minimum of 1 200 hours of advanced AOM training in one or more clini cal specialty areas at the doctoral level. As of Decemb er 31, 2012, a majority of the faculty must possess a doctoral deg ree, the terminal degree, or its international equivalent in the subject areas in which the faculty teach. Clinical supervis ors should have a minimum of five years of documented professi onal experience as licensed Oriental medicine practition ers. There has been an ongoing discussion within stakeho lder groups regarding a future first-professional doctor ate for the acupuncture profession in the US. After a lengthy d evelopment process, ACAOM published competency based standards in March 2013 and began accepting substantive change applications for review in June 2013. Faculty and other training information Faculty and other training information Faculty and other training information Faculty and other training information The accreditation standards for master's level prog rams as prescribed by ACAOM have general requirements for AOM faculty. Thus, AOM faculty must be academically qua lified and numerically sufficient to perform their responsibil ities. Additionally, the general education, professional e ducation, teaching experience, and practical professional exp erience of faculty must be appropriate for the subject area ta ught. Faculty members must also provide continuing evidence of ke eping abreast of developments in the fields and subjects in which they teach. An increasing number of faculty members at A OM Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 31 institutions now have doctoral degrees. This transi tion has been facilitated by institutions offering the post-gradu ate DAOM program. Accreditation Accreditation Accreditation Accreditation ACAOM was established in 1982 and is the only natio nal accrediting body recognized by the US Department of Education as a reliable authority for quality education and t raining in AOM. Its current scope of recognition with the USDE is the \"...accreditation and pre-accreditation (\"Candidacy\") throughout the US of first-professional master's de gree and professional master's level certificate and diploma programs in AOM, and professional post-graduate doctoral progra ms in acupuncture and in Oriental medicine (DAOM), as wel l as freestanding institutions and colleges of AOM that offer such programs....\" As an accrediting agency, ACAOM's prima ry purposes are to establish comprehensive educational and institutional requirements for acupuncture and Orie ntal medicine programs; to accredit programs and institu tions that meet these requirements; and to foster excellence i n AOM through the implementation of accreditation standar ds for AOM educational institutions and programs. ACAOM was first recognized by the US Department of Education (USDE) in 1988 for the accreditation of m aster's degree and master's-level acupuncture programs. In 1992, ACAOM was granted an expansion of scope by the USDE to include the accreditation of programs in Oriental m edicine, which are programs that include the study of Chines e herbal medicine. In May 2006, the USDE renewed ACAOM's recognition for USDE's maximum five-year period. Effective July 8, 2011, ACAOM received continued recognition by USDE for one year. ACCAOM submitted a compliance report to USDE on August 8, 2012 and is scheduled 32 | Section I for review at the June 2013 National Advisory Commi ttee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) meetin g. In conjunction with the July 8, 2011 continued reco gnition from USDE, the scope of ACAOM's authority was expan ded to include candidacy and accreditation of DAOM program s. Schools that have institutional accreditation from ACAOM may now use that accreditation to establish eligibility for Title IV funding for DAOM programs. The establishment of ACAOM and its recognition by U SDE have made it possible for AOM students to obtain fe deral student loans for their education. When the USDE re newed ACAOM's recognition in 2006, the federal agency als o granted ACAOM's request for an expansion of scope to includ e candidacy reviews, thus making it possible for nonp rofit, freestanding AOM institutions that have achieved ca ndidacy status to establish eligibility for their students to participate in federal Title IV student aid programs; however, USD E's Title IV regulations require for-profit or proprietary AOM i nstitutions to achieve accreditation to establish eligibility for their students to participate in Title IV student aid programs. ACAOM has over 60 schools and colleges with accredi tation or candidacy status. Additional AOM schools that ha ve not achieved candidate or accreditation status with ACA OM do exist in the US. The recent national trend toward the provision of h ealthcare services in integrated CAM and conventional setting s is reflected in the work of ACAOM's Doctoral Task Force (2003-20 12), which was composed of representatives from a broad segmen t of the AOM profession. The task force drafted outcomes and competency-based accreditation standards for the fi rst- professional entry-level doctorate that take into a ccount the increasing acceptance of AOM practice in convention al and complex medical environments. The task force comple ted its Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 33 review of public comments in August of 2012 and for warded final recommendations to ACCAOM. Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Currently, the right to practice acupuncture by com prehensively trained AOM practitioners exists in 44 states and i n the District of Columbia as described in each state's practice a ct. The right to practice may be designated by licensure, certificat ion, or registration under the applicable state law. Licens ure is the most common form of authorization to practice. In states without regulation, practitioners typically practice subjec t to potential oversight from a medical board. Other states may li mit practice specifically to designated medical providers or AOM practitioners who are medically supervised. In the few remaining unregulated states, activities to obtain full licensure status for acupuncturists are under way. In most states with regulation, professional acupun cturists have independent status, although there remain a fe w states where practitioners must have supervision, prior re ferral, or initial diagnosis by a conventional medical doctor. The recent statutory trend, however, is in favor of more profe ssional independence by AOM providers. The most common designation for comprehensively-trained practitione rs is Licensed Acupuncturist (LAc), although in a few sta tes they may be designated by statute as Acupuncturist Physician s (AP- Florida) or Doctors of Oriental Medicine (DOM-New M exico and Nevada), but these doctoral designations are li censure titles conferred by the state and do not reflect earned ac ademic degrees at the doctoral level. The State of Washing ton now specifies Eastern Asian Medicine Practitioner (EAMP ) although the revised statute allows the continued use of Lic ensed Acupuncturist (LAc). 34 | Section I The state statutes regulating acupuncture are not u niform. In some states there are very detailed statutes and re gulations, but in others there may be only a few paragraphs concer ning the practice of acupuncture. The administrative structu re for the regulation of acupuncture in the states also varies considerably. The most common structure is for the profession to be regulated by an independent board composed of professional ac upunc- turists or by a state medical board with the assist ance of an advisory acupuncture board or committee. Other admi nistrative arrangements include regulation by a joint board co mprised of diverse healthcare professionals (both conventional and CAM), by the board of another CAM profession, or by a lar ger administrative division within a state department\u2014a ll typically with the assistance of an acupuncture advisory body . This diversity reflects political and budgetary realitie s as each state tailors its law to meet local needs. All states regulating the practice of acupuncture r equire or accept passage of NCCAOM certification examinations or, in the case of 23 states, require full NCCAOM certificatio n as either a Diplomate of Acupuncture (Dipl. Ac. [NCCAOM]) or Di plomate of Oriental Medicine (Dipl. O.M. [NCCAOM]). Current ly, the only state not using the NCCAOM certification exams for licensure is California. California provides its ow n licensing exam. Figure 1.1 illustrates those states that use NCCAOM examinations or require full certification by NCCAO M. In general, national AOM organizations have been su pportive of the adoption of state acupuncture practice acts that incorporate reference to national standards of educ ation, training, and certification in the field. Adherence to such standards, as administered by ACAOM in the field of accreditation and by NCCAOM for certification, assu res a high level of practitioner competence and a degree of un iformity that facilitates portability among the various states in the recognition of practitioner credentials.

In recent years, the profession has ex- pressed interest in and sought to obtain such cover age. The list of eligible providers under the Program, however, i s essentially limited to those within the conventional healthcare field. Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Graduates of ACAOM accredited or candidate institut ions are qualified to take the national certification exams offered by NCCAOM. Established in 1982, the mission of NCCAOM is to establish, assess, and promote recognized standards of com- petence and safety in acupuncture and Oriental medi cine for the protection and benefit of the public. NCCAOM is a m ember of the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE) an d its certification programs in Acupuncture, Chinese Herb ology, and Oriental Medicine are accredited by the National Co mmission 36 | Section I for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), a separate independ ent commission of ICE. Accreditation by NCCA ICE repres ents the highest voluntary certification standards in the US . Passage of two or more of NCCAOM's national examinations are a requirement of licensure recognized in 43 states an d the District of Columbia. Only California has its own exam; howe ver, movement is growing in California to have the NCCAO M certification exams accepted there. Candidates who pass NCCAOM's required certification exams in Acupunctur e, Chinese Herbology, Oriental Medicine or Asian Bodyw ork Therapy are awarded the designation NCCAOM Diplomate appropriate NCCAOM comprehensive written examination in acupuncture was administered in 1985 and was develo ped over a three-year period with the assistance of leading acupuncturists throughout the US. In 1989, NCCAOM added a practica l examination of point location skills as a component of its acupuncture examination. A clean needle technique e xam was added to the certification requirements for the acu puncture written exam in 1991 and merged into the acupunctur e exam in 1998. The NCCAOM administered the first national ex amination in Chinese Herbology in 1995 and in 2000 offered it s first written examination in Asian Bodywork Therapy. In 2003, NCC AOM began to offer an umbrella certification in Orienta l medicine to applicants who demonstrated competence in both acup uncture and Chinese herbology, as well as entry-level compe tency in biomedicine. Since its inception, the NCCAOM has issued more tha n 25,000 certificates in acupuncture, Oriental Medici ne, Chinese Herbology, and Asian Bodywork Therapy and reports t he existence of more than 16,000 active Diplomates wor ldwide in current practice. Figure 1.2 shows the number of ac tively Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 37 certified (i.e. newly certified or recertified) NCC AOM Dip- lomates per state.

This provided reasonabl e assurance that acupuncture needles would be safe, thus making research easier to conduct. Subsequent investigations over t he last decade have found that acupuncture needles had few side ef fects, making them somewhat safer than certain conventiona l western 38 | Section I medical treatments for many diseases. Research in A OM has increased dramatically over the past decade within the US, as well as in Asia, Europe, and South America. Among the more prominent scientific endorsements of the efficacy of acupuncture is that of the National Ins titutes of Health, which concluded in a 1997 Consensus Stateme nt that: ...promising results have emerged, for example, showi ng efficacy of acupuncture in adult postoperative and chemother apy nausea and vomiting and in postoperative dental pain. Ther e are other situations such as addiction, stroke rehabilitation , headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, fibromyalgia, myofa scial pain, osteoarthritis, low back pain, carpal tunnel syndro me, and asthma, in which acupuncture may be useful as an ad junct treatment or an acceptable alternative or be includ ed in a comprehensive management program. Further research is likely to uncover additional areas where acupuncture inter ventions will be useful. 8 Within the AOM profession, the most prominent resea rch organization in the US is the Society for Acupunctu re Research (SAR), which was formally established in 1993 and w hose mission is to promote, advance, and disseminate sci entific inquiry into Oriental medicine systems, which inclu de acu- puncture, herbal therapy and other modalities. SAR values quantitative and qualitative research addressing cl inical efficacy, physiological mechanisms, patterns of use, and theo retical foundations. The organization sponsors biennial sym posia on research methodologies and welcomes individual affi liates including researchers, educators, students, acupunc turists, healthcare practitioners, and members of the public , as well as institutional affiliates including schools, vendors , and other organizations to participate in these events. Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine | 39 In November 2007, SAR held an international symposi um aimed at presenting and discussing the progress mad e in acupuncture research during the decade following th e NIH Consensus Development Conference. The symposium pre sen- tations, as well as their summaries are published i n the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. 9,10,11 These reports unequivocally show that the field of acupuncture re search has significantly expanded and matured since 1997. Phas e II/III sham-controlled trials have been successfully compl eted and a broad range of basic research studies have identifi ed numerous biochemical and physiological correlates of acupunc ture. However, SAR has also identified intriguing paradox es emerging from the symposium and summaries that touc h on some disconnects, including those between clinical and basic acupuncture research. A discussion of these issues was pub- lished in 2011. 12 The international conference of SAR, held in 2010, was thematically organized around the role of translati onal research within the field of acupuncture. More than 300 acup uncture researchers, practitioners, students, funding agenc y personnel and health policy analysts from twenty countries at tended this meeting. SAR intends to hold biennial conferences s tarting with the 2013 international conference and will ser ve as a venue for timely reporting of the latest acupunctur e research highlights destined for high impact research journa ls. These conferences are also an excellent forum for strengt hening research curricula in CCAOM's member schools. In 20 11, CCAOM established a pilot research grant program to encourage collaborative research proposals and impr ove the research capacity of its member colleges. 40 | Section I Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Key challenges 2013 Key challenges 2013 Key challenges 2013 Key challenges 2013 -

This definition is used by Doctor of Chiropractic degree programs in establish ing educational curricula and clinical competencies tha t prepare graduates for professional chiropractic practice. P references and practices vary in how the profession describes itse lf. A Doctor of Chiropractic may, depending on jurisdic tional definitions and individual preference, utilize any of a range of titles: chiropractor, doctor of chiropractic, docto r of chiropractic medicine, or chiropractic physician. Some will only use \"chiropractic\" to describe the practice while other s prefer \"chiropractic medicine.\" This range of usages is al so found in statutory and regulatory language. In some jurisdic tions, laws establish the terms and titles that are used. The D epartment of Labor description includes the terms \"chiropractic physician\" and \"chiropractic medicine.\" Inside the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (AC C), indiv- idual member institutions may also choose diverse d esignations. For this reason we will intersperse mixed use of th ese terms in this chapter. We urge practitioners from other disc iplines to engage the members of the chiropractic profession o n their legally-established titles and preferences. This ma y provide a useful way to improve understanding and collaborati on. Chiropractic | 49 Early chiropractic concepts of health and disease w ere compatible with vitalistic philosophies of the late 19th century. Living cells were conceived as having an inborn int elligent component that was responsible for the maintenance of life. This phenomenon is analogous to homeostasis. Some homeos tatic control mechanisms function as a result of coordina tion of sensory input and motor output through the central nervous system. The intimacy of body structure (particularl y the spine) and the nervous system, and hence body function, le d the early chiropractors to develop a philosophy of care that, in essence, posited that a normally functioning nervous system, in the presence of structural normality, should lead to no rmal health. This vitalistic approach toward health and disease was similar to that proposed by the early osteopathic profession. History of the profession History of the profession History of the profession History of the profession Chiropractic was founded by Daniel David Palmer in Davenport, Iowa in 1895. Palmer was originally a sc hoolteacher who developed an interest in magnetism and what was , at that time, popularly called magnetic healing. Having obs erved that a patient's deafness had apparently occurred followin g a traumatic experience resulting in a protuberance on his spine, Palmer reasoned that reduction of this protuberance might affect the patient's hearing. Evidently, following a manip ulation of the spine, the patient's hearing improved. This led to the form- ulation of a theory relating spinal alignment to st ates of health and disease which was similar to that espoused by A ndrew Taylor Still, the founder of osteopathy, in 1874 in neighboring Missouri. In 1975, the National Institutes of Healt h sponsored an interdisciplinary conference called \"The Research S tatus of Spinal Manipulative Therapy\" in Bethesda, Maryland. This conference brought together leaders in the field of spinal manipulation from the chiropractic, medical, and os teopathic professions from around the world. It marked a sign ificant point 50 | Section I in the evolution of chiropractic education and prac tice, and important progress has been made since that time to ward the integration of chiropractic education, science, res earch and prac- tice into mainstream systems of health care and pro fessional education. While this process is far from complete, the chiro- practic profession of today can be proud of the gre at advances in education and research of the past few decades. Chiropractic spread first to Canada, then to the Un ited Kingdom, and finally throughout the world from thes e simple roots in Davenport, Iowa. Educational institutions offer chiropractic degrees in Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia, and North and South America, with new programs currentl y under development. The Councils on Chiropractic Education Inter- national (CCEI) has published the International Chi ropractic Accreditation Standards to help establish the highest possible quality in chiropractic education programs worldwid e. The World Health Organization has also published guidel ines on basic training and safety in chiropractic education and practice. 2 Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data The chiropractic medical profession is growing rapi dly throughout the world. There are approximately 72,00 0 chiropractors in the US and about another 16,000 in the rest of the world. Doctors of chiropractic are regulated as members of a licensed healthcare profession in all jurisdictions of the United States and Canada, in Mexico, and in about 40 other countries. In roughly 60 additional countries, chiropractors prac tice in an unregulated fashion, and many of these countries ar e currently in the process of officially recognizing and regula ting the practice of chiropractic health care. In countries where chiropractic medicine is regulated, many of the chi ropractic degree programs and colleges are located within uni versity settings. The CCEI and the International Board of C hiropractic Chiropractic | 51 Examiners are working with the as yet unregulated c ountries to establish and maintain consistent and equivalent st andards of education and examination. Income data vary for chiropractors, depending on th e country and source of the data. Most sources suggest that f ull-time chiropractic physicians earn an income comparable w ith other health professionals. In two recent annual salary a nd expense surveys, chiropractors reported an average total co mpensation of $107,000 in 2012 and $123,375 in 2011. 3,4 Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Today, the traditional vitalistic philosophy has ev olved to a patient care approach that recognizes and honors th e body's own innate mechanisms for adaptation and homeostasi s. Treatment is designed to optimize and support the b ody's natural self-healing and intrinsic regulatory syste ms. In practical terms, this can be translated into an approach to care that seeks to relieve symptoms, restore joint motion, enhance posture and balance, provide necessary supp ort, strengthen muscles, improve flexibility and facilit ate coordi- nation to optimize body function. A patient may see k help for lower back pain, for example, and this approach to care will address not only the local factors associated with the back pain, but also the structural adaptations that may have l ed to it in the first place, such as weak muscles, obesity, detrime ntal postures, and other factors. Diet, activities of daily living , lifestyle behaviors and stress reduction may also be addresse d. Such an approach can be considered both patient-cen tered and holistic. Chiropractic physicians generally app roach patient care in a manner that is similar to conventional me dical doctors. Procedurally, the patient is interviewed, a detaile d health history is obtained, an examination is performed including any 52 | Section I necessary specialized tests, results are compiled a nd reviewed, and a working diagnosis is formulated. Then, a comp rehensive management plan is constructed and recommended, and the patient is afforded an opportunity to provide infor med consent before initiating any treatment. Clinical progress is monitored, and the patient is discharged from active care when the appropriate outcomes have been achieved. Chiropractic physicians establish a standard medica l history and are particularly concerned with the identificat ion of factors or conditions that may require either referral to, or co-treatment with, other healthcare providers. Patients commonly seek chiropractic services for complaints related to the musculo- skeletal system; accordingly, musculoskeletal diagn oses are common in chiropractic practices. Doctors of chiropractic focus not only on the struc tural component of a patient's complaint, but also evalua te the overall health of the patient. For example, a lower back co mplaint may be related locally to a sacro-iliac joint dysfuncti on, and generally to poor posture and obesity, all of which must be t aken into consideration in the comprehensive treatment and ma nagement plan. Clinical management plans are developed to provide symptom relief and achieve problem resolution, and to optimize whole-person health and function. Typically, treatm ent involves manual therapy, often including spinal manipulation , and other forms of treatment are commonly used as well. These may include exercise, stretching, rehabilitative measur es, physical therapeutics (such as electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, or ultra- sound), diet and nutritional counseling, lifestyle advice, and recommendations for stress reduction. Manual therap y includes a continuum of treatment methods ranging from stret ching and sustained pressure techniques to specific joint man ipulation, often referred to as chiropractic \"adjustments\". So me techniques employ articulated treatment tables, and some use m echanical Chiropractic | 53 devices that move, stretch or position body structu res. There is a very wide spectrum of techniques and methods under the umbrella of manual therapies, and the one most comm only associated with chiropractic treatment is the chiro practic manipulation or \"adjustment\" typically delivered by hand with a very specific and quick, gentle thrust. The purpose of the chiropractic adjustment is to im prove joint motion and function. The theoretical model is a dys functional articular lesion, sometimes traditionally or histor ically referred to as a subluxation. Joint dysfunction may be assoc iated with a correctible segmental mechanical phenomenon charact erized by asymmetry, restriction of motion, tissue texture ab normalities, and tenderness to palpation. Neurologically, spinal joint dysfunction, or subluxation, has been associated wi th segmental facilitation, and with trophic changes. This \"manip ulable lesion,\" as some have called it, is widely known to practiti oners of manual medicine and spinal manipulation but is not generally known or appreciated by practitioners outside of th ose fields. Early chiropractic theories of a \"bone out of place pinching a nerve\" have plagued the profession for decades and have hindered interprofessional dialogue with regard to this lesion and phenomenon. A new generation of chiropractors a nd chiropractic educators are making strides toward st andard- ization of terminology, the elucidation of the prop erties of segmental joint dysfunction, and the biomechanical effects of spinal manipulative therapy. The majority of patients consult a chiropractor for complaints directly related to back pain and other musculoskel etal complaints. Patients also seek care from chiropract ic physicians for headaches, digestive problems, hypertension, fa tigue, and many other conditions that are typically seen in a primary healthcare setting. 54 | Section I Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice The scope of practice for doctors of chiropractic i s established by jurisdictional laws and regulations, similar to all other licensed professions. Three features of legislation and prac tice are common in all jurisdictions that regulate chiroprac tic health care: 1. primary access, in which doctors of chiropractic ac cept patients directly without the requirement of referr al from any other source 2. authority and obligation to establish a diagnosis p rior to the initiation of treatment, which includes the authori ty to perform examinations and to order necessary diagnos tic studies 3. authority to manage patient care by directly provid ing treatment, referring to another provider for additi onal care, and recommending lifestyle changes to facilitate he alth and wellness A number of jurisdictions also allow chiropractic p hysicians to perform minor surgery, practice obstetrics, and prescribe medication. The scope of practice for chiropractic medicine varies widely among jurisdictions, and generally in cludes the diagnosis and treatment of human conditions. All ma nual treatment methods and the use of adjunctive approac hes such as nutritional therapy, counseling, and physical thera peutics are also commonly included in chiropractic regulation. Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Chiropractic students are taught the importance of proper and appropriate referral to other healthcare providers. Chiropractic medical education emphasizes the identification of conditions that may require specialized care and incorporates the protocols and processes for referring patients to practitione rs that can provide such care. For example, since back pain can be due to a Chiropractic | 55 variety of diseases and medical conditions, some of which require urgent referral (such as cauda equina syndr ome), doctors of chiropractic are trained to detect and manage pa tients with such conditions, including any necessary referral. Practicing chiropractic physicians seek to develop referral re lationships with conventional medical physicians, osteopathic p hysicians, and naturopathic physicians, as well as specialists such as orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists, neurologists, and gyne- cologists. Patient needs may also require referral to other practitioners, such as massage therapists, acupunct urists, phy- sical therapists, occupational therapists, clinical psychologists, or other licensed and qualified healthcare practitione rs. Many doctors of chiropractic accept patients upon t he referral of other healthcare providers. Specifically, patien ts with complaints related to the musculoskeletal system, s uch as back pain, neck pain, mechanical headaches, sports injur ies, repetitive strain injuries, motor vehicle accident injuries, w ork-related musculoskeletal injuries, overuse syndromes, and ot her similar conditions, are frequently referred by other practi tioners to chiropractic physicians for evaluation and treatmen t. Chiro- practic physicians establish mutual referral networ ks with other physicians and healthcare providers. Chiropractors typically also develop a referral network with other chiropractic physicians, particularly those specializing in certain conditio ns. Chiropractic physicians are trained to establish and maintain re cords of patient care, and this information is routinely pro vided to other health practitioners that are involved in the care of a specific patient. Third Third Third Third----party payers party payers party payers party payers Insurance coverage and third-party payment for chir opractic medical services vary widely from jurisdiction to j urisdiction. Chiropractic medicine is widely covered through pri vate insu- rance plans in most countries, particularly in the US. Most 56 | Section I government sponsored workers' compensation plans co ver chiropractic services. There is an increasing tende ncy for chiro- practic medicine to be included in wellness program s or other similar employer-sponsored health plans. Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities All educational institutions offering chiropractic education have student clinics where the underserved or uninsured may receive chiropractic care at little or no cost. A growing n umber of community clinics include chiropractic medical serv ices alongside the services of medical doctors and other healthcare services. Chiropractic physicians are increasingly involved in larger clinics and hospitals, and a growing number of hospitals grant privileges for chiropractors to treat patient s on an outpatient basis and to use diagnostic facilities. There are many other clinical settings where doctor s of chiropractic are part of a multidisciplinary team. An outstanding example is the doctors of chiropractic who serve in the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Their presen ce at this facility is the outcome of ongoing negotiations wit h the US Department of Defense to employ Doctors of Chiropra ctic in military healthcare facilities as directed by Congr ess and the President of the United States. Following recent legislation, chiropractic medicine is gradually becoming available throughout the militar y healthcare system. Experience to date has shown that chiroprac tic physicians in military healthcare facilities quickl y become integral and valued members of the healthcare team. With Presidential insistence, chiropractic medicine has also been introduced into the US Veterans Administration healthcare system. A three-year dialogue with a Federal Adviso ry Committee consisting of medical and osteopathic phy sicians, a physical therapist, a physician's assistant, and se veral doctors of Chiropractic | 57 chiropractic resulted in a list of 68 recommendatio ns to the Secretary of the Veteran's Administration on the im plementation process. Of the 68 recommendations, 67 were unanimo usly agreed upon. This program is slowly expanding throu ghout the entire VA system and current laws mandate the inclu sion of chiropractic medical services at all VA facilities within the next few years. Several chiropractic educational institu tions now have agreements with their local VA hospitals allowing c linical rotations of senior chiropractic students and inter ns, and facilitating interaction of conventional medical an d chiropractic students, interns, and residents. Chiropractic has become a highly accepted form of t reatment in the world of sports. Most major professional tea ms in all sports employ a team of chiropractic physicians. Ma ny college and university teams engage the services of a docto r of chiropractic as well. Doctors of Chiropractic provi de care in many international events such as wrestling, track and field, swimming, and other sports, and are increasingly pa rticipating on multidisciplinary healthcare teams at the Olympi cs and in professional sports. For example, chiropractic phys icians are on staff at the US Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As the world of integrative medicine and complement ary and alternative health care continues to grow, doctors of chiropractic medicine are at the forefront in many areas and are providing leadership to help establish standards and achieve cultural recognition of the benefits of complementary and al ternative health care. Several chiropractic educational insti tutions have incorporated programs in acupuncture and Oriental m edicine within their structure, at least one has added a pr ogram in naturopathic medicine, and many teach the principle s and application of homeopathic formularies, clinical nu trition, life- style counseling, mind-body medicine, yoga, and mas sage therapy. 58 | Section I Over the last decade of increased integration activ ity, indi- vidual Doctors of Chiropractic and leaders of chiro practic programs have engaged various interprofessional and inter- institutional relationships with integrative medica l programs that are among the 54 member programs of the Consor tium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine. A mong these are programs at Yale University, Harvard University , the University of Minnesota, and Oregon Health and Scie nces University (OHSU). In the latter instance, the pres ident of University of Western States Chiropractic College s erves as a Director for the Oregon Collaborative for Integrati ve Medicine (OCIM), where his colleagues include academic leade rs at OHSU and the presidents of the Oregon College of Orienta l Medicine and the National College of Natural Medicine, all l ocated in Portland, Oregon. The direction of growth and devel opment is toward a more integrated practice among all healthc are disciplines. Education Education Education Education Schools and programs Schools and programs Schools and programs Schools and programs Chiropractic colleges in the US grant the Doctor of Chiropractic degree after a course of study which consists of a minimum of 4200 classroom hours, typically delivered over a 4- 5 academic year program. There are fifteen (15) educational in stitutions in the US and two (2) in Canada that offer Doctor of C hiropractic degree programs. These include individual chiroprac tic colleges, colleges within private universities, and a college within a public university system. Typically, chiropractic students are in their mid-twenties, with about 75% having completed under graduate degrees before entering a chiropractic college. At least 90 semester hours (three years) in undergr aduate studies in the biological, physical and social scie nces are required prior to admission to chiropractic medical programs in Chiropractic | 59 the United States and Canada. Outside North America , chiro- practic degree programs are designed to be educatio nally similar to other direct-access, first-professional healthca re programs. After successfully completing the program of studie s, the graduate earns a Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degree in the US. Outside of the US, graduates of chiropractic progra ms may receive other academic designations that are consis tent with local jurisdictional requirements and customs. The most common of these credentials are the Bachelor of Sci ence and Master of Science degrees in Chiropractic. In the U nited Kingdom, a Bachelor of Chiropractic (BChir) is awar ded, analogous to the Bachelor of Medicine (MB or BMed) degree. The Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) repr esents all accredited colleges in the US and several others fr om around the world. Programs outside the US are most commonly af filiated with public universities. Accredited chiropractic d egree programs exist in Canada (2), United Kingdom (2), D enmark, France, South Africa (2), Australia (3), New Zealan d, Korea and Japan. Additional programs in England and Spain (2) hold accreditation candidate status. Several other chiro practic programs around the world are pursuing accreditatio n, and some are new or under new development including Mex ico (2), Brazil (2), Switzerland and Malaysia. Curriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum content The chiropractic curriculum typically includes cour ses in: Anatomy Biochemistry Physiology Microbiology and Immunology Pathology Public Health Clinical Skills (including history and physical exa mination) 60 | Section I Clinical and Laboratory Diagnosis Clinical Sciences (including the study of Obstetrics Pediatrics Geriatrics Diagnostic Imaging (procedures and interpretation) Psychology and Abnormal Psychology Nutrition and Clinical Nutrition Biomechanics Orthopedics Neurology Emergency Procedures and First-Aid Spinal Analysis Principles and Practice of Chiropractic Clinical Reasoning and Decision Making Chiropractic Manual Therapy and Adjustive Procedure s Research Methods and Statistics Professional Practice Ethics and Office Management There are many opportunities for postgraduate study in chiropractic. A number of full-time residency progr ams exist, of which the most popular and ubiquitous is diagnostic imaging (a three year, full-time residency). A full-time resid ency program in chiropractic geriatrics was recently initiated at N orthwestern Health Sciences University, and National University of Health Sciences offers three-year residency programs in fa mily practice and research. Other institutions are offering additional degree p rograms. Numerous certification programs exist in a variety of subject areas such as orthopedics, pediatrics, sports injur ies, and nutrition, and are typically taught at chiropractic colleges or through professional associations. Finally, a growi ng number of Chiropractic | 61 institutions are offering accredited master's degre es in chiropractic-related fields. These degree programs are completed following either part-time (including hybrid and on line learning) or full-time residential programs at institutions t hat offer the Doctor of Chiropractic degree program. Examples are Master of Science degrees in Nutrition/Functional Medicine an d Sports and Exercise Science at the University of Western S tates, Applied Clinical Nutrition at New York Chiropractic College , Health Promotion at Cleveland Chiropractic College, Advanc ed Clinical Practice at National University of Health Sciences, Sports science and rehabilitation at Logan College of Chiropractic , and Master of Health Science degrees in Clinical Nutrition and Clinical Chiropractic Orthopedics at Northwestern Health Sci ences University. Accreditation Accreditation Accreditation Accreditation Each institution offering a Doctor of Chiropractic degree program in the United States is a member of the Ass ociation of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) and is accredited by th e Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE). CCE is the agency rec ognized by the United States Secretary of Education for accred itation of programs and institutions offering the Doctor of Ch iropractic degree. CCE ensures the quality of chiropractic med ical edu- cation in the US by means of accreditation, advanci ng educational improvement, and providing public infor mation. CCE develops accreditation criteria to assess how e ffectively programs or institutions plan, implement and evalua te their mission and goals, program objectives, inputs, reso urces, and outcomes of their chiropractic programs. The CCE is also recognized by the Council for Highe r Education Accreditation (CHEA) and is a member of t he Association of Specialized and Professional Accredi tors (ASPA). 5 All but one of the institutions offering chiropract ic programs in 62 | Section I the United States also maintain institutional accre ditation through regional post-secondary accrediting associa tions. Regional are also in Canada (www.chirofed.ca), Europe (www.cce-europe.or g), and Australasia (www.ccea.com.au). Together, these accr editing bodies have formed the Councils on Chiropractic Edu cation International (CCEI). CCEI is committed to excellen ce in chiropractic education through its International Chiropractic Accreditation Standards and through aid in the development and recognition of new accrediting bodies in geographic regions where such agencies are not currently established. 6 CCEI member agencies provide accreditation services to chiropractic educational entities throughout the wo rld. Accreditation decisions and status designations by CCEI member agencies are mutually endorsed on the basis of membership in CCEI. CCEI has established the follow ing goals: 1. Define minimal model educational standards and ensu re their adoption and maintenance by accrediting agenc ies worldwide; 2. define the process of accreditation and assure appr opriate implementation and administration of the process by accrediting agencies worldwide; 3. establish and maintain a process for verifying the equivalence of the educational standards and accred itation process utilized by CCEI member accrediting organiz ations worldwide; 4. assist and provide guidance for the development of accrediting agencies toward their full autonomy and membership in CCEI; 5. promote a continuous model of educational standards , recognizing educational, cultural and legislative d iversity in various countries and regions; and Chiropractic | 63 6. advocate quality education through the disseminatio n and promotion of information to governments, profession al organizations, and others. 7 Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Doctors of Chiropractic are regulated in all jurisd ictions of the United States and Canada. Licensing boards from eac h state, and from many other jurisdictions outside the US, are m embers of the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FC LB). The FCLB mission statement is \"To protect the public an d to serve our member boards by promoting excellence in chirop ractic regulation.\" 8 Licensing laws differ among the various jurisdictio ns. Some states such as Oregon, Illinois, Oklahoma, and New Mexico allow a broader scope of practice, while other stat es such as Washington and Michigan are more restrictive. Effor ts are under way to develop and expand the scope of practice in most jurisdictions, to allow for the integration of cont emporary practices and to better serve patients that seek ca re from chiropractic physicians. Members of jurisdictional licensing boards are generally governmental appointees and se rve for established lengths of terms. Most boards also have public members that serve alongside the members of the chi ropractic profession. More information on scope of practice c an be found on the FCLB website. The FCLB also maintains a list ing of actions taken against individual chiropractors in t heir Chiropractic Information Network-Board Action Datab ank (CIN-BAD), accessible on their website for a fee. Similar organizations operate in Canada, Europe, an d Australia. Local jurisdiction regulations also vary in each of these countries. Chiropractic medicine is also prac ticed in many countries where official legal recognition has not yet occurred; in 64 | Section I unregulated locations, those claiming to practice c hiropractic often come from very diverse backgrounds and may la ck any formal education or training beyond a few seminars. The World Federation of Chiropractic has been operational for 20 years and has had significant influence and success in promot ing legislation and standards for chiropractic practice . Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications The National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) is the principal testing agency for the chiropractic profe ssion. Established in 1963, NBCE develops and administers standardized national examinations according to est ablished guidelines. NBCE is dedicated to promoting excellen ce in the chiropractic profession by providing testing progra ms that measure educational attainment and clinical compete ncy of those seeking licensure. Their examinations serve t he needs of state licensing authorities, chiropractic colleges, educators and students, doctors of chiropractic, and the public. These examinations serve the profession and public by: promoting high standards of competence assisting state licensing agencies in assessing com petence facilitating the licensure of newly graduated chiro practors, thereby enhancing professional credibility In providing standardized written and performance assessments for the chiropractic profession, the NB CE develops, administers, analyzes, scores, and reports results from various examinations. The NBCE scores are among the criteri a utilized by state licensing agencies to determine whether ap plicants demonstrate competency and satisfy state qualificat ions for licensure. In its expanding role as an international testing a gency, the NBCE espouses no particular chiropractic philosophy , but Chiropractic | 65 formulates test plans according to information prov ided collectively by the chiropractic colleges, the stat e licensing agencies, field practitioners, subject specialists, and a Job Analysis of Chiropractic .9 There are four national exams students take in order to apply for licensure (most states accept th e NBCE exam as their basic examination for licensure). The Part IV Exam is a practical clinical exam designed to test for compet ency and has gained international attention from other disciplin es. 10 Recently, an International Board of Chiropractic Examiners wa s formed for the purpose of standardizing the formal testing of chiropractic candidates for licensure outside the U S. Research Research Research Research For 60 years after its founding in 1946, the Founda tion for Chiropractic Education and Research was the central focus of research in the profession. With the significant gr owth of research capacity in the chiropractic medical schoo ls and the increasing availability of government grants, the c enter of research action in chiropractic medicine has shifte d to these academic centers. Researchers on chiropractic with Palmer Chiropractic College, University of Western States, Northwestern Health Sciences University, Southern C alifornia University of Health Sciences, National University of Health Sciences, and New York Chiropractic College are amo ng those in the United States who have received significant fed eral grants. Palmer Chiropractic College has operated an NIH con sortium center program for the last ten years, and has been involved with organizing the chiropractic profession's Research A genda Conference (RAC). This meeting has been partially s upported with federal grants. The Association of Chiropracti c Colleges (ACC) sponsors annual conferences in which educator s from around the world meet and present research papers a nd posters. Since the 1990s, this annual meeting has been combi ned with the 66 | Section I RAC. These joint ACC-RAC conferences are attended b y the academic and research community of chiropractic, as well as chiropractic practitioners, basic scientists and re searchers from related medical and health care professions. Roughl y $30 million in NIH grants was awarded to chiropractic colleges and universities from 1999-2012. A significant portion of industry support for the p rofession has also been funneled into research, including ove r $10 million from the National Chiropractic Mutual Insurance Com pany (NCMIC). Funds from Foot Levelers, Inc. have suppor ted numerous fellowships, helping Doctors of Chiropract ic obtain graduate research training at the Master's and PhD levels. Through such fellowships over the past 40 years, mo re than 100 Doctors of Chiropractic have earned graduate degree s (Master and Doctorate) in academic disciplines at major uni versities. For the last ten years, the World Federation of Chi ropractic (WFC) has played an important role in sponsoring bi ennial international research symposia, both in the US and internationally. These events have provided venues for research and educational specialists on an international lev el to collaboratively present and discuss new development s in chiropractic health care and education. The WFC pro vides a forum for dialogue and exchange on a world-wide bas is and has been productive in establishing common ground for t he profession in individual countries around the world as well as with the World Health Organization. At the federal level in the US, within the structur e of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the formation of what started as the Office for Alternative Medicine has now grown to become the National Center for Complementary and Al ternative Medicine (NCCAM). The change from having no presenc e at the NIH, to the formation of an Office with a budget of $2 million, to the formation of a Center with a budget in excess o f $100 million is indeed evidence of dramatic growth. The chiropra ctic Chiropractic | 67 profession has played a significant role in the gro wth and recognition of complementary and alternative medici ne through its research, educational, and legislative initiati ves. A Doctor of Chiropractic was the first member of a complementar y and alternative profession to be hired as program offic er by the NIH.

Philosophy, Mission, Goals Philosophy, Mission, Goals Philosophy, Mission, Goals Philosophy, Mission, Goals Several organizations and scholars have created def initions that incorporate the mission and philosophy of massage t herapy (MT). For example, in the frequently used textbook, Tappan's 72 | Section I Handbook of Healing Massage Techniques , the definition is: \"Massage is the intentional and systematic manipula tion of the soft tissues of the body to enhance health and heal ing.\" 1(p4) Similarly, according to the American Massage Therap y Association (AMTA) Glossary of Terms, massage thera \"a profession...with intention of positively affecti ng the health and well-being of the client through a variety of t ouch techniques.\" Because most definitions of massage therapy include the use of touch, which is a basic, non-technological appro ach to health and healing, it follows that most massage therapist s subscribe to a natural healing philosophy. That philosophy encom passes a preference for \"natural methods of healing, the bel ief in an innate healing force, and a holistic view of human life.\" 1(p14) With the advent of the Patient Protection and Affor dable Care Act of 2010, the healthcare system shows signs of s hifting toward collaboration between conventional and complementar y healthcare professions, with the goal of wellness i n addition to treating illness, and physicians' pay based on heal th outcomes. With doctor behavior incentivized by payment for ke eping people healthy rather than performing more tests an d procedures, massage can be particularly well suited to this shift in philosophy. The focus of most massage therapists on health improvement, a positive patient experience combined with the relatively low cost of massage treatment are aligne d with the concerns of the Triple Aim framework developed by t he Institute of Healthcare Improvement. History of the profession History of the profession History of the profession History of the profession Massage has been practiced in most cultures in both the East and the West throughout human history. Traditional peop les used a variety of techniques that are now known as massage , all of Massage Therapy | 73 which included some form of person-to-person touchi ng with the intention of manipulating and relaxing the musc les of the body. From the South Sea Islands to the Mexican pen insula and the indigenous cultures of the Americas to the anci ent civilizations of Greece, Asia and Africa, historian s and researchers find evidence of the practice of massag e. In India, the ancient practice of Ayurveda included forms of move ment therapy and massage. In Greece, Hippocrates wrote a bout the ability of massage to build muscle as well as heal it. China and Japan each developed varieties of natural healing t hat included touch. The more modern practice of massage, known as Weste rn massage or Swedish massage, became prominent in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Called the father of Swedish massage, P er Henrik Ling (1776-1839) developed a series of exerc ises that became known as \"medical gymnastics\" and used a ser ies of movements that applied resistance to the joints. Th ese techniques, however, have little resemblance to mas sage as it is known today. While there was a hands-on relationshi p between therapist and subject, the activities were more lik e those used by physical therapists than massage therapists. Ling's perspective on the practices he was developing evolved, however , and he began to consider the relationship between the phys ical and mental aspects of wellness, the mind/body connectio n, which is today very much a part of Swedish massage and other massage modalities. Not quite a century later, a Dutch physician named Johann Georg Mezger (1838-1909) developed the techniques t hat are now the basis for Swedish massage: Effleurage: Long, gliding strokes Petrissage: Lifting and kneading the muscles Friction: Firm, deep, circular rubbing movements Tapotement: Brisk tapping or percussive movements 74 | Section I Vibration: Rapidly shaking or vibrating specific mu scles Researchers noticed the similarities between the wo rk of Ling and Mezger and gave Sweden the credit for developin g these techniques. Massage technique has evolved considerably in the p ast fifty years as therapists strive to be more helpful to th eir clients and as massage research has advanced. Research and tech nique advancement is focused primarily on the effects of massage and bodywork on circulation, lymph fluid circulation, m uscle tone, fascial patterns, joint neurology, neuroendocrine e ffects, craniosacral fluid flow and stages of rehabilitatio n. Pain research projects and the effects of massage on depression a nd immune function show considerable promise. Massage Therapy | 75 Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data ** ** Industry research estimates that there are 280,000- 320,000 practicing massage therapists and massage school st udents in the US. Today's massage therapists are likely to en ter the massage therapy profession as a second career and a re predominantly female (85%). The average massage the rapist is in her early 40s. Massage therapists earn a comparable annual income to other healthcare support workers, according to the US Dep artment of Labor Statistics. In 2010, the average annual incom e for a massage therapist was $34,900. A 2012 AMTA survey i ndicates that the annual income for a massage therapist who provides 15 hours of massage per week is $21,028. More than hal f of massage therapists (53%) also earned income working in anot her profession. The majority of massage therapists are self- employed. They work an average of 15 hours a week p roviding massage and give an average of 41 massages per mont h. Growth in the healthcare industry is providing nume rous jobs for massage therapists. There has been an incr ease in the number of massage therapists directly employed by s pas and clinics or employed or contracted to work in health care settings. From 2005 to 2011, the percentage of massage therap ists who worked in a healthcare environment increased from 1 0% to 22%. According to 2011 survey results released by Health Forum, a subsidiary of the American Hospital Association (AH A) and Samueli Institute, more than 42 percent of respondi ng hospitals indicated they offer one or more complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) therapies, up from 37 per cent in * Data from the American Massage Therapy Association Industry Fact Sheet, February, 2012, unless otherwise noted. Detailed in formation available at amtamassage.org/MTIndustryFactSheet. 76 | Section I 2007. Massage therapy is in the top two services pr ovided in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Massage therapists in clinical settings typically p erform an intake interview focusing on the client's health hi story, chief complaints and main reason for seeking care. After the intake, a massage therapist usually performs an assessment in order to determine contraindications, need for referral, app ropriateness of treating and a plan for a treatment session. During the treatment session, the massage therapist employs a variety of modalities intended to influence blood flow, lymph flow, muscle tone, fascial length and organization, joint dynamics, joint neurology, and/or craniosacral flui d flow dynamics. Treatments in a clinical setting are typi cally structured into a treatment plan either by the mass age therapist or the health professional the massage therapists' work is supporting or complementing. Swedish massage (Western Massage) is designed to fa cilitate relaxation, stress relief through parasympathetic d ominance. Advanced level massage can support pain and symptom relief, structural/postural balancing and wellness-oriented collaboration with the entire healthcare team. Adva nced level massage therapists may also have specialized traini ng in lymphatic drainage, myofascial manipulation, neurom uscular manipulation, infa nt massage, pregnancy massage, oncology massage, geriatric mass age, sports massage, Asian bodywork therapies or other specialt ies in massage and bodywork. Massage Therapy | 77 Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice The scope of practice and common terms are similar in most of the state regulations, but there are significant di fferences between states. All describe massage as soft tissue manipulation to improve health or some similar idea. All exclude the authority to make a diagnosis, prescribe medications, perform chiropractic adjustments, offer injections or venipuncture, or p ractice acupuncture, or psychotherapy. Entry level training prepares practitioners for a part of the potential scope of practice afforded massage therapists. Practitioners are ethically obligated to limit their practice to what they have been adequately tr ained to do. Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Most massage therapists are adequately trained to k now how and when to refer to other healthcare professionals . Because of inconsistencies in training and experience, and the broad range of educational requirements noted below, practition ers' skills in the area of referral practices can vary. Advanced p ractitioners, however, appreciating the interdependence of mental , 78 | Section I emotional, musculoskeletal and visceral elements of the spirit- mind-body system, value collaboration with both con ventional and other complementary healthcare professionals. M ature professionals understand the appropriateness of hel ping their clients find care that is efficacious, cost effecti ve and patient- centered. This leads to an attitude of comfort with referral to the appropriate healthcare practitioner whenever indica ted. Since massage therapists do not diagnose, they need to confer on cases with physicians and other healthcare pract itioners in order to judge case management issues, when indicat ed. Massage therapists are trained to refer to lists of possible contraindications for which referral may be require d or advised. Third Third Third Third----party payers party payers party payers party payers Some third parties reimburse for massage therapy, h owever, massage therapy is not covered in Centers for Medic are and Medicaid Services legislation. Payments are most of ten made for workers' compensation claims and auto accident inju ries. Additional reimbursements vary by state and insuran ce provider. The state of Washington, for instance, ma ndates that all health plans include every category of licensed provider in their benefit design. Massage therapists are receiv ing an increasing number of referrals for healthcare treat ments. The AMTA holds a seat on the American Medical Association's Health Care Professionals Advisory Co mmittee (CPT-HCPAC). This assures representation of the pro fession in discussions of coding issues that may affect massag e therapy. Issues involving insurance, such as the AMA CPT cod es, are forwarded to the AMTA board of directors for consid eration of what path would be in the best interest of the mass age profession as a whole. Massage Therapy | 79 Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities A number of partnerships have developed between mas sage schools and medical schools. These partnerships can be as minimal as medical schools referring students to ma ssage schools in the local area or as involved as jointly developing a multi-disciplinary student clinic or a curriculum f or use in each other's institutions. Massage therapists are working more and more in int egrated settings like hospitals, wellness centers, chiropra ctic offices, and settings such as medical, physical therapy and spor ts medicine, acupuncture and Oriental medicine settings, and hol istic health centers. Massage therapists working with ACCAHC have helped in the development of the ACCAHC Competencies for Opti mal Practice in Integrated Environments which the Allia nce for Massage Therapy Education has endorsed. Massage the rapists working with ACCAHC have also been involved in interprofessional education (IPE) conferences and r esearch conferences. If the massage profession adopts the c ompetencies and prepares massage therapists in these competenci es, massage will be positioned to enter the healthcare system o f the future with its focus on integrated care. Education Education Education Education Schools and programs Schools and programs Schools and programs Schools and programs According to the Associated Bodywork and Massage Professionals (ABMP) 2011 enrollment survey, there are approximately 1,400 state-approved massage therapy training programs in the US. Of those schools/programs, 57% have been accredited by agencies recognized by the US Departm ent of Education. While the number of massage therapy trai ning institutions has grown dramatically since the late 1990s, the 80 | Section I number of training programs has declined slightly i n the past five years. Of these massage school programs in the US, nearly 74% have programs of 500 hours or more with the average at 6 50 hours. In most cases, the total number of hours a school offe rs trends closely to what is required by that state for licen sure. This varies from state to state. The minimum number of hours re quired by the Federal Department of Education for national ac creditation for massage programs is 600. The Alliance for Massage Therapy Education was orga nized in 2009 as a 501c 6 non-profit corporation. It was created to \"fill a gap\" as the profession was missing a not-for-profit dedicated to education. There are three member groups represente d by the Alliance: schools, continuing education providers, and teachers. The AFMTE was designated by the ACCAHC board of dir ectors to represent massage educators in October 2011. The AFMTE is dedicated to improving the quality of massage thera py education by raising teacher standards, curriculum standards and education standards. The AFMTE created a set of core competencies for massage therapy teachers in 2012 t o be used as the basis for a national teacher certification prog ram and for implementation in accreditation standards and state regulations to bolster the quality of massage education. They a lso hold an annual conference on massage education. A national membership organization, a national busi ness with a membership component, and several state orga nizations provide services and support to schools. The two na tional groups are the not-for-profit American Massage Ther apy Association (AMTA) and the for profit Associated Bo dywork and Massage Professionals (ABMP). AMTA offers school memberships that includes benefi ts such as an annual leadership conference, a teacher educa tion track at the annual convention, webinars, and monthly intera ctive conference calls known as \"Teacher Talk\" for facult y, an Massage Therapy | 81 education calendar for schools to list their contin uing education programs, and optional school liability and busines s property insurance. AMTA has long been an advocate of fair a nd consistent legislation regarding massage therapy. T he Government Relations Committee works with schools a nd chapters to lobby and develop regulations that supp ort high standards for the profession. The organization also offers an annual AMTA Schools Summit. The ABMP offers a complimentary membership to AFMTE with a paid school membership in ABMP. This organiz ation has a staff of six professionals who work directly with the schools. School memberships include materials and resources for students and faculty, classified ads and job postin gs, an e-mail account and online networking forums, optional scho ol liability and business property insurance. Most importantly, the ABMP offers an annual ABMP School Issues Forum for schoo ls to network and discuss common challenges. The ABMP has an extensive website with archived webinars, teaching tips, learning checklists, and rubrics to support faculty and student success. There is also a regional program known as Teachers on the Frontline . These are free one-day seminars to support professional teacher development. Curriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum content Unlike the other disciplines within ACCAHC, there a re neither national standards nor a single recognized body tha t the whole massage profession has designated to determine the knowledge and skills required to call one a member of the fie ld. Although there is a specialized accrediting agency for massa ge therapy which is recognized by the US Department of Educati on, the Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (COMTA) , which maintains curriculum competencies, fewer than 10% of massage programs are currently accredited by this a gency. There exists, therefore, a wide variety in the type and q uality of 82 | Section I education available in massage schools and programs . At this time, there is no consensus regarding the required number of hours of study for entry-level massage. The majorit y of states are at 500 hours and this is also the necessary minimum to sit for the national certification exams. For schools that are not COMTA- accredited, the national certification exams have b een the most consistent requirement for many years. Consequently , many schools shaped their curriculum around the required content areas for those exams. The National Certification B oard for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB) has a pro cess for authorizing applicants to take the exams based on completion of training in these core areas: 125 hours of instruction in the body's systems and anatomy, physiology and kinesiology 200 hours of in-class, supervised hands-on instruct ion in massage and bodywork assessment, theory and applica tion instruction 40 hours of pathology 10 hours of business and ethics instruction (a mini mum of 6 hours in ethics) 125 hours of instruction in an area or related fiel d that theoretically completes your massage program of stu dy Many practitioners choose to take continuing educat ion courses to gain more extensive training in a specif ic modality or area of practice. Requirements for continuing educa tion vary from state to state depending on state licensure re quirements, according to the membership organization a practiti oner chooses to join, and depending on whether the practitioner elects to maintain the national certification credential. Until national curriculum standards are adopted by the profession, state regulations, certification and ac creditation standards dictate curriculum content to the schools . This Massage Therapy | 83 arrangement is problematical for the maturation of the profession and for public health clarity because th e state curriculum requirements are neither rigorous nor consistent, and almost 50% of the schools are not subject to review by any accreditation agency, yet all are allowed to regist er as \"approved\" schools. Accreditation Accreditation Accreditation Accreditation The Commission on Massage Therapy Accreditation (CO MTA) is recognized by the US Department of Education as specializing in massage. COMTA was started by the massage profes sion in 1982 and granted recognition by the US Department o f Education in 2002. COMTA provides either institutio nal or programmatic accreditation. Both designations inclu de a comprehensive evaluation of curriculum competencies . Institutional accreditation is available to schools teaching only massage, bodywork and/or aesthetics. Programmatic accreditation is available to massage therapy and b odywork programs within schools which already have institut ional accreditation from another recognized agency. Accreditation by COMTA requires that at least one p rogram in massage or bodywork offered by the school contai ns 600 clock hours of content and includes teaching and assessme nt of the required competencies. The minimum clock hour requi rement was increased from 500 to 600 in 2001 with a goal o f eventually increasing the amount again when enough schools wer e prepared to offer longer training. In addition to t he content areas required by NCBMTB exams, the COMTA competencies ou tline requirements in areas such as medical terminology, research literacy, client communication and professional rel ationships. 84 | Section I Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Forty-four states and the District of Columbia have some form of regulation in place for massage therapy. There is a lack of consistency among these licensure laws. Depending o n the state law, massage therapists can be referred to as licen sed, state certified, or registered. In most cases, only indiv iduals who have the state designation may perform massage or use a title indicating that they perform massage. Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications The National Certification Board for Therapeutic Ma ssage and Bodywork (NCBTMB) is an independent, private, nonpr ofit organization that was founded in 1992 to establish a certification program and uphold a national standard of excellenc e. NCBTMB's exam programs are accredited by the Instit ute for Credentialing Excellence (ICE). There are currently more than 75,000 nationally certified massage practitioners, located in every state in the US and the District of Columbia. Beginning in 2013, NCBTMB's current national certif ication will transition to a board certification in massage therapy. This credential will require more than the minimum educa tion required by most state licensing requirements, a pr edetermined number of hours of documented hands-on work experie nce, a waiting period of a minimum of 6 months from gradua tion plus passage of NCBTMB's exam. The exam is designed to m easure critical thinking rather than simple recall. Additi onally, the program includes adherence to the NCBTMB Code of Et hics and Standards of Practice, current CPR certification, p assing a national background check along with other eligibil ity criteria. The last component of this credential is a commitme nt to lifelong learning and re-certification. This new credential will be the first Massage Therapy | 85 of its kind for the massage profession, offering a true separation between licensing and certification. NCBTMB entry-level licensing exams (NCETM and NCETMB) are used in 38 states and the District of C olumbia in either statute or rule. To keep with best past prac tices, NCBTMB conducts a Job Task Analysis (JTA) every five years to ensure content relevancy. NCBTMB conducted its fifth JTA i n 2012 for the licensing exams. The Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSM TB), established in 2005, is currently made up of 32 sta te licensing boards and agencies that regulate the massage thera py and bodywork profession. The mission of the FSMTB is to support its member boards in their work to ensure that the prac tice of massage therapy is provided to the public in a safe and effective manner. In October 2007, FSMTB created an entry-lev el national licensure examination to serve the needs of the reg ulatory community in licensing massage therapists after com pleting a JTA. The FSMTB concluded a second JTA in 2012. Curr ently, 40 states accept the FSMTB exam. For detailed results and a state- by-state compendium of laws, please visit the FSMTB website listed in the Resources section. Research Research Research Research The Massage Therapy Foundation's (MTF) mission is t o advance the knowledge and practice of massage therapy by su pporting scientific research, education, and community servi ce. The Foundation funds research studies investigating the many beneficial applications of massage therapy. Foundat ion research grants are awarded to individuals or teams conducti ng studies that promise to advance the understanding of specif ic therapeutic applications of massage, public percept ions of and attitudes toward massage therapy, and the role of m assage therapy in healthcare delivery. 86 | Section I The Massage Therapy Foundation commissioned a resea rch agenda in 1999, recommending areas of research in m assage therapy and bodywork that are most needed. This age nda will be reviewed in 2013. Investigators who apply for MT F research grants are referred to the agenda and are encourage d to address one of the following in their research: Build a massage research infrastructure Fund studies into safety and efficacy Fund studies of physiological (or other) mechanisms (how massage works) Fund studies stemming from a wellness paradigm Fund studies into the profession of therapeutic mas sage and bodywork The MTF launched the International Journal of Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork: Research, Education and Pract ice (IJTMB) in August, 2008. It is a free, online, peer-reviewed j ournal. In addition to its efficacy for muscle and other so ft tissue ailments, research has shown that massage therapy c an relieve symptoms associated with many health issues, such a s osteorarthritis. 2 Among the other ways massage therapy has been shown to be effective are: Relief of back pain More than 100 million Americans suffer from low-bac k pain, and nearly $25 billion a year is spent in sea rch of relief. A 2003 study showed that massage therapy produced b etter results and reduced the need for painkillers by 36% when compared to other therapies. Today, massage therapy is one of the most common ways people ease back pain. 3 Treating Migraines Of the 45 million Americans who suffer from chronic headaches, more than 60% suffer from migraines. For many, Massage Therapy | 87 it's a distressing disorder that is triggered by st ress and poor sleep. In a recent study, massage therapy reci pients exhibited fewer migraines and better sleep quality during the weeks they received massage, and the three week s following, than did participants who did not receiv e massage therapy. Another study found that in adults with migraine headaches, massage therapy decreased the occurrence of headaches, sleep disturbances, and di stress symptoms. It also increased serotonin levels, belie ved to play an important role in the regulation of mood, s leep, and appetite. 4,5 Easing Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Carpal tunnel syndrome is a progressively painful c ondition that causes numbness and tingling in the thumb and middle fingers. Traditional treatments for carpal tunnel r ange from a wrist brace to surgery. However, a 2004 study fou nd that carpal tunnel patients receiving massage reported significantly less pain, fewer symptoms, and improv ed grip strength compared to patients who did not receive massage. 6 Reducing Anxiety An estimated 20 million Americans suffer from depre ssion. A review of more than a dozen massage studies concl uded that massage therapy helps relieve depression and a nxiety by affecting the body's biochemistry. In the studie s reviewed, researchers measured the stress hormone c ortisol in participants before and immediately after massag e and found that the therapy lowered levels by up to 53%. Massage also increased serotonin and dopamine, and neurotransmitters that help reduce depression. 7 Alleviating Symptoms and Side Effects of Cancer Massage therapy is increasingly being applied to sy mptoms experienced by cancer patients, such as nausea, pai n, and fatigue. Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer 88 | Section I Center asked patients to report the severity of the ir symptoms before and after receiving massage therapy . Patients reported reduced levels of anxiety, pain, fatigue, depression, and nausea, even up to two days later. 8 In a study of breast cancer patients, researchers found that those who were massaged three times a week reported lower levels of depression, anxiety and anger, while incr easing natural killer cells and lymphocytes that help to b attle cancerous tumors. 9,10 Lowering Blood Pressure Hypertension, if left unchecked, can lead to organ damage. Preliminary research shows that hypertensive patien ts who received three 10-minute back massages a week had a reduction in blood pressure, compared to patients w ho simply relaxed without a massage. 11 Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities The following descriptions are intended to assist t he reader in understanding aspects of the massage therapy profes sion rather than formal positions taken by the massage field on the issues. Key challenges 2012 Key challenges 2012 Key challenges 2012 Key challenges 2012- ---2015 2015 2015 2015 There is inconsistent use of terminology and defini tions within the massage therapy profession. To continue to move toward consistency, terminology will need to be standardized. Revising and adopting the Massage The rapy Body of Knowledge (MTBOK) would be a strong step toward accomplishing this. Massage therapy educational programs need to move t o greater standardization in the content, scope, and length of entry-level training programs. This could be accomp lished Massage Therapy | 89 by revising educational standards based on MTBOK, COMTA and the Entry Level Analysis Project (ELAP). Faculty qualifications vary greatly from school to school with no commonly agreed upon formal training for massage therapy instructors. Such training is also part of creating consistency in educational programs for massage the rapy. Without consistency in educational programs and fac ulty qualifications, consistency in terminology will pro ve difficult. Consumer expectations will also be affec ted. Adopting the AFMTE Teacher Standards and basing tea cher training on them could be significant steps toward accomplishing this. Key opportunities 2012 Key opportunities 2012 Key opportunities 2012 Key opportunities 2012- ---2015 2015 2015 2015 Further development of industry partnerships with p otential massage therapy employers will increase knowledge o f massage therapy training and credentials among thos e industries, and provide more opportunities for coll aboration in client care. Partnership with employers will, in turn, give the massage education institutions much needed info rmation on what employers' needs are so curriculum can be developed to meet those needs and enhance the likel ihood of job placement for graduates. Development of the profession's research base will allow practitioners to provide more effective, outcome-ba sed massage therapy for their clients, which will provi de better results and increase the demand for massage therapy . Establishing awareness of and interest in massage a s an effective therapy will increase acceptance by healt hcare providers and third-party payers. Greater communica tion within the profession will also increase as a stand ardized scientific language is more commonly used. As massage therapy becomes a more integral componen t of the complementary, alternative, and integrative asp ects of 90 | Section I health care, there will be an increasing demand for quality, standardization, and research. This demand will hel p set the parameters for the profession to evolve into a more recognized, valuable, and respected part of health care. Improvement of industry partnerships with all healt hcare professions, both conventional and complementary an d alternative. Creation of a Model Practice Act to standardize ter minology, to create consistency in state statutes and to impr ove teacher training standards, educational standards, curricul um standards and facilitate portability for licensed p ractitioners moving state to state. Further utilization and promotion of COMTA programm atic accreditation to assure consistent curriculum conte nt, educational quality and faculty qualifications. Resources Resources Resources Resources Organizations and websites Organizations and websites Organizations and websites Organizations and websites The profession is represented by a number of member organizations and one national certification organi zation: Alliance for Massage Therapy Education (AFMTE) was founded in 2009 as a nonprofit organization as an independent voice, advocate, and resource for the q uality of massage education. AFMTE is comprised of massage schools, continuing educators in massage, and massa ge school faculty. AFMTE represents the education aspe ct of massage therapy (council of colleges/schools) withi n ACCAHC. The Alliance is working to advance massage education by developing a set of competencies for m assage faculty; a training program for massage faculty bas ed on those competencies; a revision of the MTBOK to clar ify definitions and terminology for entry level massage Massage Therapy | 91 education, advanced level massage education, and sp ecialty certifications; curriculum standards; higher educat ion standards as well as support for a Model Practice A ct. American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) is a not-for- profit membership organization that represents more than 150 massage therapy schools and programs and has mo re than 58,000 member massage therapists. AMTA works t o establish massage therapy as integral to the mainte nance of good health and complementary to other therapeutic processes, and to advance the profession by promoti ng certification and school accreditation, ethics and standards, continuing education, professional publications, le gislative efforts, public education, and fostering the develo pment of members. AMTA offers liability insurance to its mem bers. Associated Bodywork and Massage Professionals (ABMP ) is a private business with professional membership dim ensions founded in 1987 to provide massage and bodywork practitioners with professional services, informati on, and public and regulatory advocacy. ABMP has initiative s in the areas of promoting ethical practices, protecting th e rights of practitioners, and educating the public regarding t he benefits of massage and bodywork. Its current membership tot als over 82,000. Members must adhere to a published cod e of ethics. Federation of State Massage Therapy Boards (FSMTB) was formed in 2005 to bring the regulatory community to gether and provide a forum for the exchange of information . The result of the exchange was the development of a lic ensure exam which was introduced in 2007. The FSMTB's miss ion is to support its member boards in their work to ensur e that the practice of massage therapy is provided to the publ ic in a safe and effective manner. There are currently 41 m ember boards with 40 states and territories accepting the exam for licensing. 92 | Section I National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massag e and Bodywork (NCBTMB) was founded in 1992 as a nonprofi t organization to establish a national certification program and uphold a national standard of professionalism. NCBT MB works to foster high standards of ethical and profe ssional practice through a recognized, credible credentiali ng program that assures the competency of practitioner s of therapeutic massage and bodywork. NCBTMB also has outreach programs for stakeholders, including schoo ls and state boards. The organization had certified more t han 90,000 massage therapists and bodyworkers as of the date o f publication of this booklet.

Midwifery entry Midwifery entry Midwifery Edition (2009) Author and Second Edition (2013 ) Editor: Jo Anne Myers-Ciecko, MPH Partner Council (MEAC) About the Author/Editor : Myers-Ciecko is Senior Advisor for the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council. Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Midwives work in partnership with women to give the necessary support, care, and advice during pregnanc y, labor and the postpartum period, to conduct births on the mid wife's own responsibility, and to provide care for the newborn and the infant. This care includes preventive measures, the promotion of normal birth, the detection of complications in mot her and child, the accessing of medical or other appropriate assis tance, and the carrying out of emergency measures. Midwives have a n important task in health counseling and education, not only for the woman, but also within the family and community . This work involves prenatal education and preparation fo r parenthood, and may extend to women's health, sexua l or reproductive health, and childcare. 1 Direct-entry midwifery refers to an educational pat h that does not require prior nursing training to enter the pro fession. Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs) are direct-e ntry midwives who are nationally certified, a credential first awarded in 1994. The National Association of Certified Prof essional Midwives (NACPM) was founded in 2000 to increase wo men's access to midwives by supporting the work and pract ice of 98 | Section I CPMs. NACPM adopted the following Philosophy and Principles of Practice in 2004: 1. NACPM Members respect the mystery, sanctity, and potential for growth inherent in the experience of pregnancy and birth. 2. NACPM members understand birth to be a pivotal life event for mother, baby, and family. It is the goal of mid wifery care to support and empower the mother and to protect th e natural process of birth. 3. Members of NACPM respect the biological integrity o f the processes of pregnancy and birth as aspects of a wo man's sexuality. 4. Members of NACPM recognize the inseparable and interdependent relationship of the mother-baby pair . 5. NACPM members believe that responsible and ethical midwifery care respects the life of the baby by nur turing and respecting the mother, and, when necessary, counsel ing and educating her in ways to improve fetal/infant well- being. 6. NACPM members work as autonomous practitioners, recognizing that this autonomy makes possible a tru e partnership with the women they serve and enables t hem to bring a broad range of skills to the partnership. 7. NACPM members recognize that decision making involv es a synthesis of knowledge, skills, intuition, and judg ment. 8. Members of NACPM know that the best research demonstrates that out-of-hospital birth is a safe a nd rational choice for healthy women, and that the out-of-hospi tal setting provides optimal opportunity for the empowe rment of the mother and the support and protection of the normal process of birth. 9. NACPM members recognize that the mother or baby may on occasion require medical consultation or collaborat ion. Direct-Entry Midwifery | 99 10. NACPM members recognize that optimal care of women and babies during pregnancy and birth takes place withi n a network of relationships with other care providers who can provide service outside the scope of midwifery prac tice when needed. While NACPM represents CPMs, the Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA), founded in 1982, is a broad-b ased alliance representing the breadth and diversity of the profession of midwifery in the United States. Members include Certified Professional Midwives as well as Certified Nurse-Mi dwives (CNMs), state-licensed midwives, and traditional mi dwives who serve special populations such as the Amish or indi genous communities. MANA \"Core Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practic revised in 2011, include the following guiding prin ciples: The midwife provides care according to the followin g guiding principles of practice: Pregnancy and childbearing are natural physiologic life processes. Women have within themselves the innate biological wisdom to give birth. Physical, emotional, psychosocial and spiritual fac tors synergistically shape the health of individuals and affect the childbearing process. The childbearing experience and birth of a baby are personal, family and community events. The woman is the only direct care provider for hers elf and her unborn baby; thus the most important determinant of a healthy pregnancy is the mother herself. 100 | Section I The parameters of \"normal\" vary widely, and each pregnancy, birth and baby is unique. In consideration thereof: Midwives work in partnership with women and their chosen support community throughout the caregiving relationship. Midwives respect and support the dignity, rights an d responsibilities of the women they serve. Midwives are committed to addressing disparities in maternal and child healthcare status and outcomes. Midwives work as autonomous practitioners, although they collaborate with other healthcare and social service providers when necessary. Midwives work to optimize the well-being of mothers and their developing babies as the foundation of caregiving. Midwives recognize the empowerment inherent in the childbearing experience and strive to support women to make informed decisions and take responsibility for their own and their baby's well-being. Midwives integrate clinical or hands-on evaluation, theoretical knowledge, intuitive assessment, spirit ual awareness and informed consent and refusal as essential components of effective decision making. Midwives strive to ensure optimal birth for each woman and baby and provide guidance, education and support to facilitate the spontaneous processes of pregnancy, labor and birth, lactation and mother-ba by attachment, using appropriate intervention as neede d. Midwives value continuity of care throughout the childbearing cycle and strive to maintain such continuity. Direct-Entry Midwifery | 101 Midwives are committed to sharing their knowledge and experience through such avenues as peer review, preceptorship, mentoring and participation in MANA's statistics collection program. 2 Chara Chara Chara Characteristics and Data cteristics and Data cteristics and Data cteristics and Data There are approximately 2,000 Certified Professiona l Midwives (CPMs). Information on the number of direct-entry m idwives who are not CPMs is not available, though estimates range from 500 to 3,000. CPMs are typically self-employed, wor king in small, community-based practices. There are approxi mately 11,000 certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) practicing i n the US. Most CNMs practice in hospitals, while virtually al l CPMs attend births in the client's home or freestanding birth centers. Direct-entry midwives own half of all birth centers in the country. Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Approach to patient care Midwifery care encompasses the normal childbearing cycle of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care. NACPM, MANA, and other leading organizations that support direct-ent ry midwifery endorse the following statement: \"The Midwives Model of Care is based on the fact that pregnancy and birth are normal life events. The Mid wives Model of Care includes: monitoring the physical, psychological and social well-being of the mother throughout the childbearing cycle; 102 | Section I providing the mother with individualized education, counseling, and prenatal care, continuous hands-on assistance during labor and delivery, and postpartum support; minimizing technological interventions; and identifying and referring women who require obstetrical attention. The application of this model has been proven to re duce the incidence of birth injury, trauma, and cesarean sec tion\". 3-9 Researchers who interviewed direct-entry midwives e arly in the development of the home-birth movement found th at a wellness orientation, shared responsibility, passiv e management, holistic care, and individualized care were central to the midwifery approach to care. 10 Exemplary midwifery practice was described by clients, direct-entry midwives, an d nurse- midwives in another study that identified critical process-of-care qualities such as supporting the normalcy of birth, respecting the uniqueness of the woman and family, vigilance and a ttention to detail, and creating a setting that is respectful a nd reflects the woman's needs 5. The North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) stat es that, \"CPMs work with women to promote a healthy pr egnancy, and provide education to help her make informed dec isions about her own care. In partnership with their clien ts they carefully monitor the progress of the pregnancy, la bor, birth, and postpartum period and recommend appropriate managem ent if complications arise, collaborating with other healt hcare providers when necessary. The key elements of this education, monitoring, and decision making process are based o n evidence- based practice and informed consent. \"11 Direct-Entry Midwifery | 103 Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice The National Association of Certified Professional Midwives (NACPM) defines the midwives' scope of practice as providing expert care, education, counseling, and support to women and their families throughout the caregiving partnershi p, including pregnancy, birth, and postpartum. NACPM members pro vide ongoing care throughout pregnancy and continuous, h ands-on care during labor, birth, and the immediate postpar tum period. They are trained to recognize abnormal or dangerous conditions needing expert help outside their scope and to cons ult or refer as necessary. The North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) recognizes that each midwife is an individual with specific practice protocols that reflect her own style and p hilosophy, level of experience, and legal status, and that pra ctice guidelines may vary with each midwife. NARM does not set proto cols for all CPMs to follow, but requires that they develop their own practice guidelines in written form. In certain jurisdictions, the midwives' scope of pr actice includes well-woman care and family planning servic es. Midwives may also administer certain drugs and devi ces as specified in state law, including IV fluids, antibi otics, local anesthetic, antihemorrhagics for postpartum use, et c. Midwives typically carry oxygen and resuscitation equipment and are certified in adult and neonatal resuscitation. Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Direct-entry midwives care for essentially healthy women expecting normal pregnancy, birth, and postpartum e xperiences. Midwives consult with and refer to an array of heal thcare professionals, social service providers, and others whose services may benefit the woman and her family. These include , but are not limited to, allopathic physicians, naturopathic physicians, acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists, childbirth 104 | Section I educators, psychologists, family therapists, doulas , nutritionists, social workers, and food support and housing agenci es. In some states, midwives are legally obligated to consult w ith and/or refer women to obstetricians or family physicians w ith obstetrical privileges when certain conditions aris e. In addition, because the vast majority of direct-entry midwives attend births in their clients' homes or in freestanding birth ce nters, any complications that require hospitalization for labo r and/or birth necessitate transfer of care to an obstetrical care provider with hospital privileges. Most transfers are non-emergen t, resulting from a failure to progress in labor, the mother's d esire for pain relief, or maternal exhaustion. Less common but mor e urgent indications include preeclampsia, maternal hemorrha ge, retained placenta, malpresentation, sustained fetal distress, and respiratory problems in the newborn. Third Third Third Third----party payers party payers party payers party payers Direct-entry midwives are reimbursed by private ins urance plans and contract with managed care organizations in many states. A number of states mandate reimbursement un der \"every category of provider\" or \"any willing provider\" law s. At least ten states reimburse direct-entry midwives for serv ices provided to women on Medicaid. This is a high-priority issue for the National Association of Certified Professional Midw ives (NACPM), which is committed to achieving national r ecognition for the CPM, including mandatory inclusion in Medic aid programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Car e Act 2010 stipulates Medicaid reimbursement for licensed care providers working in birth centers, which includes licensed m idwives. Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities NACPM is represented in numerous national organizat ions and initiatives focused on healthcare reform and women' s health Direct-Entry Midwifery | 105 issues. These include the Integrated Healthcare Pol icy Consortium, Health Care for America Now, and the Na tional Quality Forum. MANA is a member of the Coalition fo r Improving Maternity Services, a broad-based coaliti on of over 50 organizations, representing over 90,000 members. Th e coalition's mission is to promote a wellness model of maternity care that will improve birth outcomes and substantially reduc e costs. MANA is also a partner in The Safe Motherhood Initi atives- USA, a partnership of organizations whose goal is t o reduce maternal mortality in the United States. NACPM and MANA joined with four other groups to form the Midwives and Mothers in Action Campaign, a partnership whose goa l is to gain federal recognition of certified professional midwives so that women and families will have increased access to quality, affordable maternity care in the settings of their choice. In 2012, NACPM and the Association of Midwifery Edu cators co-hosted a symposium focused on the opportunities for integration and expansion of midwifery in a new mat ernity care system. A series of reports from the symposium were issued throughout 2012 and are available on the CPM Sympos ium website. In 2011, a diverse group of stakeholders, including midwives and physicians, researchers and policy-makers, was invited to examine home birth within the context of the matern ity care system. Using Future Search methodology to identify common ground and build consensus, the goal was to establi sh what the whole system can do to support those who choose hom ebirth, and provide the care, safety net, consultation, col laboration and referral necessary to make homebirth the safest and most positive experience for all involved: moms, babies, families, communities, healthcare workers, hospital personnel , administrators, payers, and so on. 12 106 | Section I The following statements reflect the areas of conse nsus that were achieved by the individuals who participated i n the Home Birth Consensus Summit: STATEMENT 1 We uphold the autonomy of all childbearing women. A ll childbearing women, in all maternity care settings, should receive respectful, woman-centered care. This care should include opportunities for a shared decision-making process to help each woman make the choices that ar e right for her. Shared decision making includes mutu al sharing of information about benefits and harms of the range of care options, respect for the woman's auto nomy to make decisions in accordance with her values and preferences, and freedom from coercion or punishmen t for her choices. STATEMENT 2 We believe that collaboration within an integrated maternity care system is essential for optimal moth er-baby outcomes. All women and families planning a home or birth center birth have a right to respectful, safe , and seamless consultation, referral, transport and tran sfer of care when necessary. When ongoing interprofessional dialogue and cooperation occur, everyone benefits. STATEMENT 3 We are committed to an equitable maternity care sys tem without disparities in access, delivery of care, or outcomes. This system provides culturally appropriate and affordable care in all settings, in a manner that i s acceptable to all communities. We are committed to an equitable educational system without disparities in access Direct-Entry Midwifery | 107 to affordable, culturally appropriate, and acceptab le maternity care provider education for all communiti es. STATEMENT 4 It is our goal that all health professionals who pr ovide maternity care in home and birth center settings ha ve a license that is based on national certification tha t includes defined competencies and standards for education an d practice. We believe that guidelines should: allow for independent practice facilitate communication between providers and across care settings encourage professional responsibility and accountability; and, include mechanisms for risk assessment. STATEMENT 5 We believe that increased participation by consumer s in multi-stakeholder initiatives is essential to impro ving maternity care, including the development of high q uality home birth services within an integrated maternity care system. STATEMENT 6 Effective communication and collaboration across al l disciplines caring for mothers and babies are essen tial for optimal outcomes across all settings. To achieve th is, we believe that all health professional students and practitioners who are involved in maternity and new born care must learn about each other's disciplines, and about maternity and health care in all settings. 108 | Section I STATEMENT 7 We are committed to improving the current medical liability system, which fails to justly serve socie ty, families, and healthcare providers and contributes to: inadequate resources to support birth injured children and mothers unsustainable healthcare and litigation costs paid by all a hostile healthcare work environment inadequate access to home birth and birth center birth within an integrated healthcare system; and restricted choices in pregnancy and birth. STATEMENT 8 We envision a compulsory process for the collection of patient (individual) level data on key process and outcome measures in all birth settings. These data would be linked to other data systems, used to inform quality improvement, and would thus enhance the evidence ba sis for care. STATEMENT 9 We recognize and affirm the value of physiologic bi rth for women, babies, families and society and the value o f appropriate interventions based on the best availab le evidence to achieve optimal outcomes for mothers an d babies. 13 In 2006, the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherh ood convened a national working group to develop guidel ines to ensure that the healthcare needs of pregnant women, new mothers, fragile newborns, and infants would be ade quately met during and after a disaster. They recommended that CPMs Direct-Entry Midwifery | 109 should be engaged in local and regional planning ef forts, that home-birth skills should be taught to all providers , and that information be provided on how to prepare for birth outside the hospital. In 2001 the American Public Health Association adop ted a resolution supporting \"Increasing Access To Out-Of- Hospital Maternity Care Services Through State-Regulated and Nationally-Certified Direct-Entry APHA s upports licensing and certification for direct-entry midwiv es, increased funding for scholarship and loan repayment programs , and eliminating barriers to the reimbursement and equit able payment of direct-entry midwives. 14 In 1999 the Pew Health Professions Commission and t he UCSF Center for the Health Professions issued a joi nt report on \"The Future of Midwifery\" calling for expanding edu cational opportunities for nurse-midwifery and direct-entry midwifery, health policies that facilitate integration of midw ifery services, and research to evaluate practices. 15 There are currently two midwifery education program s located in state-funded colleges and another in dev elopment. Faculties from other direct-entry programs are ofte n invited to lecture in medical and nursing programs. Educa Educa Educa Education tion tion tion Schools and Programs Schools and Programs Schools and Programs Schools and Programs There are currently nine schools and programs accre dited by the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council. These in clude three degree-granting institutions, one program located w ithin a university, and five schools offering certificate p rograms. Four offer distance learning courses in combination with clinical preceptorships. Three of the freestanding schools a nd the university-based program all participate in US Depa rtment of Education Title IV financial aid programs. 110 | Section I There are nearly 600 students enrolled in accredite d midwifery programs and institutions. In addition, t here are at least that many more independent students who are c ompleting community-based apprenticeships, following guidelin es provided by NARM, whose competency will be assessed individually through NARM's Portfolio Evaluation Pr ocess.

All MEAC-accredited institutions and programs offer com pre- hensive programs that prepare graduates to become C ertified Professional Midwives (CPMs). Most of the accredite d programs are three years in length. The standards for accreditation address curriculum requirements, faculty qualifications, facilities an d students 118 | Section I services, fiscal responsibility and administrative capacity. MEAC accreditation requires that the curriculum address core competencies and the essential knowledge and skills identified by NARM. The clinical component must be at least on e year in duration and must include specific clinical experie nce require- ments. Programs must provide evidence that graduate s are cap- able of passing the NARM written examination and be coming CPMs and/or meeting the requirements for state lice nsure. Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Direct-entry midwives are licensed or otherwise leg ally recognized practitioners in Alaska, Arkansas, Arizo na, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Lou isiana, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jerse y, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carol ina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washingt on, and Wisconsin. All of these states (except New York) us e the NARM written examination in their state regulatory proce ss and/or recognize the CPM credential. A few states also req uire that applicants complete an accredited education program . Direct- entry midwives practice independently in most of th ese jurisdictions. Some state laws stipulate conditions requiring consultation or referral and others do not. Many pr ovide a formulary of prescriptive drugs and devices that mi dwives may obtain and administer. Current information, includi ng access to individual state laws, is available at the MANA web site. 16 In 2012, NARM adopted a position statement in suppo rt of state licensure for CPMs. 17 At that time, there were active efforts in at least 11 states to secure licensure legislati on. Direct-Entry Midwifery | 119 Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications Examinations and certifications The North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) is t he certifying agency for CPMs. Certification is a cred ential that validates the knowledge, skills, and abilities vita l to responsible midwifery practice, and that reflects and preserves the essential nature of midwifery care. The CPM credential is uni que among maternity care providers in the US as it requires t raining and experience in out-of-hospital birth. The NARM certi fication process recognizes multiple routes of entry into mi dwifery and includes verification of knowledge and skills and t he successful completion of both a written examination and skills assessment. NARM conducts periodic surveys of CPMs and complete s a national job analysis to assure that the examinatio n is based on real-life job requirements. Candidates for certific ation must be graduates of an accredited program or must complete a Portfolio Evaluation Process administered by NARM. Certificat ion is renewed every three years and all CPMs must obtain continuing education and participate in peer review for recert ification. The CPM credential is accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) which is the accrediting body of the National Organization for C ompetency Assurance (NOCA). NCCA encourages their accredited certification prog rams to have an education evaluation process so candidates who have been educated outside of established pathways may h ave their qualifications evaluated for credentialing. The NAR M Portfolio Evaluation Process meets this recommendation. Certified professional midwives must demonstrate th at they have met the minimum education, skills, and experie nce requirements set forth by the North American Regist ry of Midwives. Competence is assessed against a comprehe nsive and detailed list of knowledge, skills and abilities. S tudents must also participate in a minimum of 55 births (at least 5 b irths in homes and 2 births in hospital), including 25 births wher e the student 120 | Section I functions in the role of primary midwife under supe rvision, providing full continuity of care for at least 5 wo men. Students must also participate in specific minimum numbers o f prenatal, postpartum and newborn care experiences. Research Research Research Research There is a growing body of evidence that points to the many benefits of midwifery care. In October 2008, the Mi lbank Memorial Fund released Evidence-Based Maternity Care: What It Is and What It Can Achieve . The report presented best evidence that, if widely implemented, would have a positive impact on many mothers and babies and would improve value for paye rs. The report also identified barriers to providing eviden ce-based maternity care, and made policy recommendations to address the barriers. Care provided by certified profession al midwives, documented in a landmark study of CPMs published in 2005, was highlighted in the Milbank Report: \"The low CPM rates of intervention are benchmarks f or what the majority of childbearing women and babies who are in good health might achieve.\" An international review of the literature published by the Cochrane Collaboration in October 2008 found that \" Midwife- led care was associated with several benefits for m others and babies, and had no identified adverse effects. The main benefits were a reduced risk of losing a baby before 24 week s. Also during labor, there was a reduced use of regional a nalgesia, with fewer episiotomies or instrumental births. Midwife- led care also increased the woman's chance of being cared for in labor by a midwife she had got to know. It also increased the chance of a spontaneous vaginal birth and initiation of breastf eeding. In addition, midwife-led care led to more women feelin g they were Direct-Entry Midwifery | 121 in control during labor. There was no difference in risk of a mother losing her baby after 24 weeks.\" The review concluded that all women should be offered midwife-led models of care. Another comprehensive review of the scientific evid ence underlying the Coalition for Improving Maternity Se rvices (CIMS), \"Ten Steps of Mother-Friendly Care,\" was pu blished in 2007. The authors found that equally good or better outcomes can be achieved in low-risk women having planned ho me births or giving birth in freestanding birth centers. An economic cost-benefit analysis of direct-entry m idwifery licensing and practice was undertaken in 2007 at th e request of the Washington State Department of Health. The rese archers determined that planned out-of-hospital births atte nded by professional midwives had similar rates of intrapar tum and neonatal mortality to those of low-risk hospital bi rths. They also found that medical intervention rates for planned o ut-of-hospital births were lower than planned low-risk hospital bi rths. Using conservative cost estimates, they estimated the cos t savings to the healthcare system (public and private insurance ) was $2.7 million per biennium and recovery from Medicaid fee -for- service alone was more than $473,000 per biennium. These cost savings were achieved by licensed midwives attendin g just 2% of all births in the state. Midwives Alliance of North America data collection has been ongoing since 1993 and includes a complete set of p rospective data contributed by CPMs during the year 2000, when NARM required their participation. MANA established a Di vision of Research in 2004; it is charged with administering an online data-entry system, establishing research priorities , promoting publication, and providing education on research co ncepts and methods. A new web-based data collection system was launched in November 2004 and allows midwives to enter and r eview their own practice data as well as compiling data f rom all practices. Mechanisms are in place to provide acces s to the 122 | Section I database for researchers to use this unique system to study various aspects of midwifery care. Experts from the Centers for Disease Control have shown an interest in this data base as it may now be the only repository of normal birth data in the country.

Participation in healthcare reform and federal reco gnition of the CPM are current priorities for the NACPM. The Midwives Alliance of North America (MANA) was f ounded in 1982 to form an identifiable and cohesive organi zation representing the profession of midwifery. MANA supp orted the creation of national standards for the certificatio n of midwives. The certification process is administered by the No rth American Registry of Midwives and results in the credential Certified Professional Midwife (CPM). However, MANA does not require that members be certified and has an ongoing commit ment to be an inclusive organization accessible to all midwive s, regardless of their credential or legal status. MANA oversees numerous projects, including legislative advocacy, internati onal relations, and public relations. The MANA Division of Research maintains a web-based system for prospective data collection that is a resource to midwives and other researchers interest ed in the processes and outcomes of midwifery care. The Association of Midwifery Educators was launched in 2006 to strengthen schools and support midwifery educators. They publish a newsletter which has addressed topics ran ging from faculty qualifications to student admissions practi ces.

Naturopathic medicine is a holistic ap proach to health care that recognizes and respects the indivi duality of the patient. The American Association of Naturopathic P hysicians (AANP) defines naturopathic medicine as \"a distinct system of primary health care: an art, science, philosophy, a nd practice of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of illness.\" Naturopathic medicine has its foundation in the bio medical sciences, and is a comprehensive system of health c are. Naturopathic physicians act to stimulate the inhere nt self- healing abilities of the individual through lifesty le change and the application of non-suppressive therapeutic meth ods and modalities, including clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, physical medicine, and health psycholog y. Naturopathic physicians are also schooled in and ab le to apply conventional clinical practices including emergency medicine, minor surgery, pharmacology, and natural childbirth . 1 Naturopathic physicians respect and apply the princ iples of traditional world practices such as Traditional Chi nese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, which provide an added basi s for understanding the individual patient from a constit utional perspective. The techniques of naturopathic medicine include tra ditional and modern, empirical and scientific methods. 2 Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles upon wh ich its practice is based. The application of these princip les in practice is continually reexamined in the light of scientific a dvances. The philosophy of naturopathic medicine is embodied by six principles: Naturopathic Medicine | 133 First, Do No Harm (primum no nocere ) Naturopathic physicians strive to minimize harmful side effects, using the least invasive means necessary t o diagnose and treat the patient. Use the Healing Power of Nature (vis medicatrix naturae ) Naturopathic physicians recognize and seek to stren gthen the inherent ability of the body to heal itself. Th e naturopathic physician's role is to work with the p atient to identify and remove obstacles to healing, and to fa cilitate and enhance the self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Cause Naturopathic physicians strive to identify and addr ess the underlying causes of disease. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic physicians recognize that the health o f the patient must be addressed at all levels: physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmental. Educate the Patient (docere) A primary role of the naturopathic physician is to educate the patient and empower the individual to take responsibility for her/his own health. Naturopathic physicians recognize and foster the therapeutic pow er of the doctor/patient partnership. Focus on Prevention Naturopathic physicians believe that preventing dis ease is preferable to waiting until the disease must be tre ated. This focus includes assessing risk factors and susc eptibility to disease, encouraging lifestyle choices that prev ent 134 | Section I diseases from manifesting, and intervening in disea se processes to slow their progression. Naturopathic medicine is aimed at strengthening the body's natural self-regulatory (self-healing) ability. In the naturopathic model, therapies are applied to reestablish physiol ogical and psychological homeodynamics. Symptoms are seen as t he body's way of alerting the patient to pay attention to som e aspect of her/his health. Naturopathic physicians believe tha t there are detrimental health consequences to merely suppressi ng symptoms without addressing the cause. For example, the naturopathic model recognizes fever as the body's a ttempt to heal itself. Naturopathic treatment might be aimed at stimulating the fever (while monitoring the process to prevent an elevation that would be dangerous), with the kno wledge that when the temperature has reached a certain level, t he body's self-regulatory system will be activated and the tr ajectory of the temperature rise will be reversed. The naturopathic model posits that even specific diseases will benefit from non-s pecific therapies, because these non-specific therapies wil l enhance the body's ability to self-regulate. The use of homeopa thy in naturopathic medicine is exemplary of this assertio n that when the body is given the information it needs, it will self-correct. Several key features of the naturopathic model dist inguish it from the allopathic model: 1. The distinction between disease (as a physiological process) and illness (as the psychological experience of the condition) is de-emphasized in the naturopathic model. The ter m imbalance is used to refer to both the biological aspects th at initiate or exacerbate the problem and to the patie nt's experience. Both the biological aspects and the pat ient's experience must be addressed. Naturopathic Medicine | 135 2. The naturopathic model is holistic. It recognizes t he interconnectedness of physiological systems (e.g., the central nervous system and the immunological system) and of systems at different levels of the organism (e.g., the physical level and the psychological level). Naturopathic me dicine features a multifactorial approach to healing (e.g. , a treatment plan that includes specific therapeutics, diet, exercise, and stress management). 3. Naturopathic medicine works within the framework of self- regulation, i.e., it works with the biological syst ems that have been organized to maintain health. This is apparent in the belief that the body has the power to heal itself a nd that the role of the physician is to remove obstacles to tha t healing. 4. Naturopathic medicine works within as well as betwe en levels of the organism. Healing at the deepest leve ls cannot occur until healing has taken place at the more sup erficial levels. Symptoms that are suppressed without addres sing the cause will later manifest in other ways, potent ially at deeper levels which will lead to more serious disea se states. Therefore, healing must be addressed at all levels. 5. Because naturopathic philosophy acknowledges multifactorial etiology to dysfunction, naturopathi c treatment is highly individualized, taking into acc ount the unique circumstances of the patient's physiology an d life. Treatment is specifically targeted toward the indiv idual patient's particular areas of dysregulation. 6. The patient-physician relationship is seen as a par tnership, with the patient collaborating in treatment. This r elationship is recognized as being a vital aspect of the healin g process. 7. Quality is as important as quantity. This applies t o the foods the patient puts into her/his body (nutrient-rich o r nutrient- empty), the kind of air s/he breathes (clean or pol luted), the environment in which s/he lives (toxin-free or toxi c), and the 136 | Section I kind of relationships in her/his life (supportive o r destructive), etc. 8. Naturopathic medicine recognizes and seeks to enhan ce three kinds of effects. Specific effects result from the application of a therapy that is known to have a pa rticular effect on a targeted area (e.g., ingestion of a bot anical substance that is known to reduce gastric acidity). General effects result from individualized treatment prescr iptions, and serve to increase the body's resistance to exte rnal disruptions (e.g., the use of Astragalus to stimula te the immune system). Non-specific effects are those effects that are a result of the mind/body connection. Characteristics Characteristics Characteristics Characteristics and Data and Data and Data and Data In 2000, the University of California, San Francisc o Center for the Health Professions reported that there were approxi mately 2,000 licensed naturopathic physicians practicing in Nort h America 3. Since then, the profession has more than doubled. I n 2012, the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AA NP) estimated that there were approximately 3,400 natur opathic physicians licensed/registered in the United States and its territories, and the Canadian Association of Naturo pathic Doctors estimated that there were approximately 1,9 00 naturopathic doctors licensed/registered in the Can adian provinces and territories. Of the respondents in th e most recent (2011) Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Examinatio ns (NPLEX) Practice Analysis (PA) survey, 77% were fem ale, the mean age was 41 (median 39), and 81% were Caucasian (with 6% Asian, 5% multi-ethnic, 1% Latino, 1% Black/African American). Of the survey respondents, approximately 20% were p racticing in unregulated states/provinces. 4 According to the Chronicle of Higher Education's 2009 Occupational Brief, 5 naturopathic physicians work 30 to 50 hours Naturopathic Medicine | 137 a week. Of the respondents in the 2011 NPLEX PA sur vey, 63% said they work at least 30 hours per week. Most nat uropathic physicians provide health care through office-based practice. Practitioners may make house calls or see patients in the evenings or on weekends. In addition to seeing pati ents, some naturopathic physicians serve as adjunct faculty at one of the naturopathic medical colleges or other health profe ssions programs (e.g., nursing). Many lecture in other ven ues. While entry-level naturopathic physicians typically earn $35,000 a year with the expectation of annual incre ases, some new graduates are challenged to earn adequate incom e if they are not strong entrepreneurs. The NPLEX PA survey f ound that of the naturopathic doctors who were working less t han full time, 50% cited lack of patients as the reason. 4 Experienced naturopathic physicians may earn from $45,000 to $1 00,000 a year. The NPLEX PA Survey found that approximately 10% of the respondents reported gross earnings of more than $200,000 per year, 4 but how this translates to net income is dependent on many factors, including the number of hours devoted to practice, the location of the practice, overhead expenses, an d insurance coverage. Earning potential is also affected by pro fessional certification, the types of services offered, the e mphasis of treatment, and the population where the practice is centered. Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care Clinical Care AA AApproach to patient care pproach to patient care pproach to patient care pproach to patient care Using the six principles outlined above, naturopath ic physicians seek to understand the factors that underlie and co ntribute to the patient's condition, to remove obstacles to healing , to strengthen the patient's inherent healing ability, and to teac h the patient about dietary and lifestyle choices that support we llness and optimal health. 6 In striving to attain an in-depth understanding of the patient's health, naturopathic physicians co nsider genetic 138 | Section I predispositions in combination with superimposed fa ctors such as nutritional status, work and emotional stressors , environmental allergens and toxins, and bio-mechani cal issues. Essential to a comprehensive evaluation is the exte nded interview, which ranges from 60 to 90 minutes for a new patient. A standard review of systems is supplemented with p atient- generated reports of daily activities (including di etary habits, physical activity, and psychological well-being). N aturopathic physicians perform physical examinations and use co nventional as well as innovative laboratory and diagnostic ima ging procedures when appropriate. With many treatment op tions at their disposal, naturopathic physicians follow a di stinct clinical rationale to individualize patient care within the framework of naturopathic principles. Follow-up appointments typ ically range from 30 to 45 minutes, and may occur more frequentl y in the beginning in order to support dietary and lifestyle changes. In 1996 the AANP recommended that further work on practice principles move from the profession to the academic community. Clinical faculty and practitioners built on the core foundation throughout the 1990s. Three principles w ere identified that underlie the clinical practice of naturopathic medicine: 7,8 1. Disease is characterized as a process rather than a pathologic entity; 2. focus is on the determinants of health rather than on pathology; and 3. a therapeutic hierarchy guides the course of treatm ent. As taught in naturopathic medical schools, the ther apeutic hierarchy is a guideline for applying various modal ities and approaches according to the unique needs of the ind ividual patient and the natural order of the healing proces s. The Naturopathic Medicine | 139 therapeutic hierarchy proposes the following order from most gentle to most invasive: 1. establish the conditions for health by removing obs tacles to healing 2. stimulate the self-healing mechanisms 3. support weakened or damaged systems or organs 4. address structural integrity 5. address pathology using specific natural substances , modalities, or interventions 6. address pathology using specific pharmacologic or s ynthetic substances 7. employ surgical correction and other invasive thera pies that may have significant side effects. For example, for a child who has recurrent otitis m edia, conventional treatment would consist of repeated co urses of antibiotics and, in some cases, tympanostomy. A nat uropathic physician would take a different approach: 1. Use the child's medical history, physical examinati on, and laboratory tests to look for and remove or address obstacles to health. In this child's case, these obstacles ma y include allergens (e.g., dust mites, dander, etc.), environ mental irritants (e.g., second hand cigarette-smoke), food sensitivities (dairy, wheat, and eggs are most ofte n implicated), poor nutrition (e.g., a diet high in p rocessed grains and sugars), mechanical misalignments (e.g., of the cervical spine or cranial bones), and emotional fac tors (e.g., family stress). Children routinely improve signific antly after these factors are addressed. 2. Stimulate the healing power of nature with therapie s such as homeopathy and hydrotherapy. 140 | Section I 3. Strengthen the affected systems by providing genera l immune support with nutritional supplementation (e. g., vitamins C and A) or botanical medicines (e.g., Ech inacea angustifolia). 4. Address structural factors (e.g., using soft tissue manual therapy such as lymphatic drainage). 5. Treat the pathology with specific natural therapies (e.g., topical garlic, Verbascum Thapsus oil, Hypericum perforatum oil). 6. Prescribe a course of antibiotics if the infection is particularly recalcitrant or severe, or if there are other compr omising factors. 7. Refer the child to a pediatrician or otolaryngologi st if the infection still does not subside. The therapeutic hierarchy creates a guideline for t reatment that is both consistent with the principles of naturopat hic medicine and addresses the patient's dynamic needs. 9 Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice Scope of practice Naturopathic physicians are trained as primary care providers (PCPs). Some choose to specialize in populations, m odalities, or other focused areas of clinical practice. Every jur isdiction that licenses/regulates the practice of naturopathic med icine gives naturopathic physicians the authority to diagnose a s well as treat. This ability to diagnose distinguishes natur opathic physicians from practitioners who use natural thera pies (such as botanical medicines and homeopathy) but who were no t trained at CNME-approved naturopathic medical programs and who are not licensable in any of the regulated jurisdic tions. Diagnosis includes eliciting a medical history, performing a physical examination, and (in many cases) ordering laborator y tests and/or diagnostic imaging studies. Naturopathic Medicine | 141 In the states that have functioning regulatory Boar ds, naturopathic physicians are allowed to prescribe bo tanical medicines, nutritional supplements, and homeopathic remedies, to provide physical therapies, and to provide healt h and lifestyle counseling. In the past 3 years, several states hav e expanded their formularies and scopes of practice. Eight sta tes allow naturopathic physicians to practice minor surgery, and eleven states have drug prescription rights that allow som e type of parenteral (IM or IV) administration of supplements or drugs. In some states, prescriptive authority is limited to f irst-line antibiotics and bio-identical hormones, while in ot her states naturopathic physicians have full prescriptive auth ority for all drugs except chemotherapeutics and anti-psychotics. Prescribing rights are important for continuity of care, as a n aturopathic physician cannot take a patient off a drug unless s /he also has the right to prescribe that drug. Several states al low for expanded scope of practice in specific areas under the naturopathic license. For example, three states all ow naturopathic doctors to practice acupuncture, and 9 states allow them to practice natural childbirth (primarily in o ut-of-hospital settings). Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Referral practices Naturopathic physicians are trained and may serve a s primary care providers. They collaborate with other health professionals and refer patients for optimum management of the pa tient's health care, especially for those patients who have life- threatening or challenging chronic conditions. 10 Third Third Third Third----party payers party payers party payers party payers Insurance reimbursement for naturopathic physicians in the United States varies from jurisdiction to jurisdict ion, although in the regulated states many private and governmental programs cover naturopathic care. The NPLEX PA survey found that only 142 | Section I 19% of patient visits in North America were covered by insurance, although it must be kept in mind that no t all naturopathic physicians accept third-party insuranc e. Some states provide student loan forgiveness to naturopa thic physicians for service to urban and rural underserv ed communities and include naturopathic physicians as primary care providers in medical home legislation. In Verm ont, naturopathic care is covered under Medicaid. In Ore gon, naturopathic physicians are included in some coordi nated care organizations. In Canada, reimbursement varies from province to province, but minimal coverage is available in s ome provincial healthcare programs. Unfortunately, rest rictions on fees and numbers of covered visits drive most natur opathic doctors out of provincial healthcare programs. Priv ate insurance companies in Canada are beginning to offer more rea sonable coverage, but most of the population does not have private insurance. Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Naturopathic physicians practice in a wide variety of clinical settings and collaborate with diverse practitioners from both conventional and alternative health professions. Th e NPLEX PA survey found that only 32% of the respondents were practicing in an office by themselves; 22% practiced in clinic s with other members of their profession, 22% practiced in clini cs with other non-ND healthcare professionals, and 24% practiced in clinics where there were other naturopathic doctors as well as practitioners from other professions. Examples of i ntegration with more conventional medical practitioners includ e: Integrative oncology: A number of oncology centers around the country integrate naturopathic physicians into their hospital and outpatient centers, providing patients with a Naturopathic Medicine | 143 wide range of treatment options and expertise in co mbating their illness. Integrative rheumatology: Many patients suffering f rom autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis an d systemic lupus erythematosus benefit by combining t he skills and knowledge of a conventional rheumatologi st (MD) and a naturopathic physician. Two Institute of Medicine projects in 2009-2011 inc luded naturopathic physicians either on committees or con tracted with them for papers. Public, rural, and community health: public and com munity health clinics that are in proximity to naturopathi c colleges often integrate services from naturopathic physicia ns. For international communities in need (e.g., Nicara gua, Mexico, Africa, India), healthcare services are bei ng provided through naturopathic college-based student precepto rships and internships offered by organizations such as Naturopathic Doctors International and Naturopathic Medicine for Global Health. Education Education Education Education Schools and Programs Schools and Programs Schools and Programs Schools and Programs Approximately 2250 students are currently enrolled at one of seven CNME-accredited naturopathic medical schools: Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington, founded i n 1978 o Including Bastyr University branch campus in San Diego, California, opened in 2012 Boucher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine in Vanco uver, British Columbia, founded in 1998 Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in Toront o, Ontario, founded in 1978 144 | Section I National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, O regon, founded in 1956 National University of Health Sciences in Lombard, Illinois, Naturopathic Program started in 2004 Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe , Arizona, founded in 1992 University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Me dicine in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Program started in 1997 Student Population Student Population Student Population Student Population For students enrolled in the Fall 2011 entering cla ss, the mean cumulative GPA was 3.30, and the mean science GPA w as 3.46. The mean age was 31, with a bi-modal distribution o f students in their early 20s continuing directly after their und ergraduate programs, and older students pursuing a second or t hird career. Minority students comprised approximately 22% of th e 2011 entering class. The typical naturopathic student po pulation is approximately 80% female. Faculty Faculty Faculty Faculty Faculty in the biomedical sciences predominantly ha ve PhDs. Clinical faculty at naturopathic medical schools mu st have a terminal degree in their respective fields. The cli nical sciences are taught by naturopathic doctors and other licens ed practitioners such as medical doctors, osteopathic doctors, chiropractors, psychologists, and practitioners of acupuncture and Oriental medicine. Curriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum contentCurriculum content Naturopathic physicians are trained through an educ ational process that is comparable to that of allopathic me dical doctors (MDs) and doctors of osteopathy (DOs). Acceptance i nto a naturopathic medical school requires a bachelor's d egree with pre-medical sciences, including biology, general an d organic chemistry, and physics, as well as psychology and h umanities. Naturopathic Medicine | 145 The naturopathic college admission process requires official undergraduate transcripts and essays that provide i nsight into the candidate's understanding of naturopathic medic ine, as well as her/his motivation for applying to naturopathic medical school. Individuals who meet the application criter ia are interviewed by faculty, staff, and students to asse ss academic ability, interpersonal skills, and professional dem eanor. With the biomedical sciences as a foundation, natur opathic medical education integrates Western diagnostic dec ision- making skills with natural as well as conventional therapies. Students spend more than 4000 hours during the four -year post baccalaureate program learning the art and science of naturopathic medicine. Naturopathic principles, phi losophy, and theory guide the curriculum and provide a conce ptual framework for students to develop a profound unders tanding of humans in health and disease. The curriculum is dyn amic, adapting to meet the changing healthcare needs of t he population and to address the many obstacles to hea ling that patients experience. Naturopathic medical education pays particular attention to the growing epidemic of chr onic diseases that affect every age group and sector of society. At naturopathic medical school, students take two y ears of graduate level studies in the biomedical sciences. Although naturopathic medical students receive training in t he same biomedical sciences in which allopathic medical stu dents are trained, there are differences in the emphasis in t he courses and in the way that knowledge is applied. For example, slightly less emphasis is placed on anatomy, requiring an average of 350 hours in a naturopathic curriculum, compared to 380 hours in an allopathic/osteopathic curriculum. However, in natu ropathic programs, greater emphasis is placed on physiology. Naturopathic students receive approximately twice a s many hours of physiology as allopathic students (250 hou rs compared to 125 hours) 11 . This difference may reflect the greater emphasis 146 | Section I in naturopathic medicine on working with the dynami c processes of the person, rather than on the static structure of the body. Coursework during the first year focuses on develop ing students' understanding of the human body in health and disease. Recent trends show programs moving toward integrated systems-based biomedical training, with clinical education introduced in the first year or two. Anat omy, biochemistry, microbiology, physiology, embryology, histology, neuroanatomy, and genetics accompany introductory c lasses in naturopathic philosophy, nutrition, mind-body medic ine, homeopathy, and botanical medicine. The second year introduces students to Western diagnostic knowledge , with courses in clinical diagnosis, pathology, lab diagn osis, and diagnostic imaging. Lab sections teach students cri tical skills in history-taking and physical examination. Intermedia te courses in naturopathic therapeutics continue to deepen studen ts' understanding of clinical nutrition, manipulative t herapy and physical medicine, homeopathy, and botanical medici ne. In years three and four, students engage in supervised patient care on diverse patient populations. Didactic education continues to build expertise in naturopathic therapeutics, and a dds in-depth coursework in pediatrics, gynecology, gastroenterol ogy orthopedics, cardiovascular health, disorders of th e eyes, ears, nose, and throat, oncology, nephrology, and dermato logy. Naturopathic principles guide the curriculum design and course content. Clinical training takes place in a variety of clini cal settings. Clinical faculty provide training and supervision o f care in multidisciplinary medical centers. Students see pat ients who have a wide range of clinical conditions, from acut e illnesses (e.g., respiratory infections, influenza, gastroint estinal infections, musculoskeletal injuries, and minor lacerations) to chronic, sometimes life-threatening diseases (e.g., asthma, diabetes, Naturopathic Medicine | 147 colitis, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemi a, metabolic syndrome, arthritis, cancer, kidney disease, etc.). Experienced licensed clinicians, including naturopathic doctors , medical doctors, osteopaths, chiropractors, psychologists, and practitioners of acupuncture and Oriental medicine supervise students and oversee high quality patient care in t he school clinics. In addition to the colleges' outpatient cl inics and medical centers, students provide free care to thousands of medically underserved women, children, and men at homeless sh elters, HIV/AIDS clinics, drug and alcohol rehabilitation p rograms, elementary schools in impoverished immigrant commun ities, shelters for battered women and children, and commu nity health centers. These programs benefit the patients , who receive high quality naturopathic, conventional, and preven tive care, as well as the students, who are introduced to a diver se population of patients who are often under-insured and sufferi ng disproportionately from itions. AccrediAccrediAccrediAccreditation tation tation tation Founded in 1978, the Council on Naturopathic Medica l Education (CNME) was incorporated in the District o f Columbia to accredit naturopathic medical programs in the Un ited States and Canada. A member of the Association of Speciali zed and Professional Accreditors, the CNME is the only natu ropathic accrediting body recognized by the US Department of Education. The CNME Board comprises institutional members from accredited naturopathic medical schools, profession members who are licensed naturopathic physicians and public members who possess educational experience and are unaffili ated with any naturopathic program or the profession. In addi tion to establishing educational criteria for accreditation , the CNME requires programs to participate in the self-study process. Site 148 | Section I visits are conducted for candidacy, for initial acc reditation, and to renew accreditation. 12 In addition to programmatic accreditation by the CN ME, all naturopathic medical schools in the United States h ave institutional accreditation from their respective r egional accrediting agencies and in Canada from their provi ncial accrediting bodies. Accreditation holds institution s to high academic, financial, and human resource standards. Accreditation also ensures that schools respect aca demic freedom in teaching and include faculty, staff, and students in decision-making processes. Equally important, accre dited institutions join a community of colleges and unive rsities who share the ideas, innovations, and experiences that drive continuous quality improvement. As noted above, seven naturopathic programs are cur rently accredited by the CNME. Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status Regulatory status The Federation of Naturopathic Medicine Regulatory Authorities was established in 2011 to facilitate c ommunication between regulatory bodies, and to serve as a single body with which other entities in the profession can communic ate. In the United States, naturopathic medicine is regulated i n 16 states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, H awaii, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, N orth Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia. Two territories, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, are also regulated. Licensure efforts are underway in at least 12 other states. In Canada, naturopathic medi cine is regulated in six provinces (Alberta, British Columb ia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan). A high pri ority for both the American Association of Naturopathic Physi cians and Naturopathic Medicine | 149 the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors is to support legislative efforts to increase the number of state s and provinces that regulate the profession. To be eligible to be licensed/registered as a natur opathic physician in a regulated jurisdiction, a candidate must graduate from an accredited naturopathic medical school, and must pass national board examinations and other jurisdiction- specific examinations. Board ex Board ex Board ex Board examinations aminations aminations aminations The North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) is responsible for ensuring that candidates for licensure/registration have the requisite knowledge and skills to be safe practitioners. NABNE administers the Naturo pathic Physicians Licensing Examinations (NPLEX), which ar e the board examinations required by all jurisdictions th at regulate naturopathic medicine. NPLEX is administered in two parts. Both parts are competency-based. Students take the Part I Biomedic al Science Examination after they complete their biomedical sc ience training. Part II Clinical Sciences Examinations ma y be taken after the candidate has passed the Part I Examinati on and has graduated from a CNME-accredited naturopathic medic al school.

Both the Part I and Part II Examinations use an int egrated case- based format. For the Part I Biomedical Science Exa mination, a brief case is presented and the examinee is asked f our or five questions regarding anatomy, physiology, biochemist ry, pathology, microbiology and/or immunology that are relevant to the patient's diagnosis. For the Part II Core Clini cal Science Examination, a more complete case is presented (inc luding results of lab testing and diagnostic imaging), and the examinee is asked to diagnose the condition, interpret lab a nd imaging findings, and prescribe appropriate treatments with in the context of naturopathic principles. Research Research Research Research Clinical trials and some laboratory studies are con ducted at naturopathic medical schools in the United States a nd Canada. Naturopathic Medicine | 151 As the profession matures and the capacity for rese arch expands (reflected in institutional commitment and developm ent of a skilled research workforce), the number and quality of research studies improve. Naturopathic doctors often earn an MPH (Masters in Public Health) or PhD degree as part of their development as researchers, and then work at naturo pathic institutions or at conventional academic health cen ters. There are currently naturopathic doctor researchers at the Un iversity of Washington, Yale University, the University of Mich igan, and Oregon Health and Science University. Others work w ith agencies such as the Group Health Research Institut e, RAND Corporation, and the Samueli Institute. From 2002-2004, the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) National Center for Complementary and Alternative M edicine (NCCAM) funded the development of the Naturopathic Medical Research Agenda (NMRA). The NMRA brought together naturopathic physicians and conventional research s cientists to identify and prioritize a list of research question s and areas. 13 Research departments from all naturopathic medical schools participated in a series of meetings and produced a consensus document on the future of naturopathic research. Th e highest priorities focused on three areas: Naturopathic treatment of type 2 diabetes Naturopathic care for the preservation and promotio n of optimal health in geriatric populations Developing methodologies to understand the healing process Between 1999 and 2012, NCCAM awarded approximately $25 million in research grants to institutions with pro grams in naturopathic medicine. Studies have been published on naturopathic approaches to specific conditions (e.g ., diabetes and cardiovascular disease), the effectiveness of i ndividual 152 | Section I botanical medicines (e.g., Urtica urens for hay fever, Echinacea angustifolia for URIs, Cimecifuga racemosa for menopausal symptoms); homeopathic medicines (e.g., coca for al titude sickness, regional pollens for hay fever); nutritio nal supplementation (e.g., SAMe for osteoarthritis) and naturopathic detoxification for environmental illnesses. Other p ublished studies have examined the nature of patient experie nce with naturopathic treatment. In 2010, the Naturopathic Physicians Research Insti tute (NPRI) was founded. A key focus in this organizatio n has been \"researching the way we practice\" using research me thods which recognize that most disease has multiple caus es and is best addressed using an array of interventions. Vir tually all naturopathic practice reflects this perspective; co nsequently, single agent trials do not adequately measure the v alue of naturopathic medicine or support enhancement of its practice. The NPRI website lists some of these emerging whole practice trials. Naturopathic researchers were among the lea ders who played a significant role in a successful ACCAHC-le d effort to educate the NCCAM to elevate the importance of exam ining the impact of whole disciplines in the agency's 2011-20 15 strategic plan. Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Challenges and Opportunities Key challenges 2012 Key challenges 2012 Key challenges 2012 Key challenges 2012- ---2015 2015 2015 2015 The greatest challenge facing the naturopathic prof ession today is the insufficient number of states and prov inces that regulate naturopathic medicine. Currently less than a third of the states regulate the profession. With more than 95% of licensed naturopathic physicians practicing in only 16 regulated states, the need for what naturopathic me dicine has to offer cannot be met nationally. Furthermore, Naturopathic Medicine | 153 healthcare consumers in the 34 unregulated states d o not have adequate knowledge of naturopathic medicine. T his has implications not only for patient demand, but f or student recruitment as well. The profession must continue t o push for regulation in more states and provinces. Consumers are confused regarding the differences be tween licensed naturopathic doctors and those practitione rs (in unregulated states) who call themselves naturopaths or NDs but who do not have professional degrees or the cre dentials to be safe and effective practitioners. The profess ion must focus on educating consumers about the value of tra ined, licensed naturopathic physicians. Scope of practice in some jurisdictions is limited. Although the number of naturopathic medical schools has increased significantly, there are still fewer than 6,000 naturopathic physicians in practice today. The smal l number of naturopathic practitioners clearly limits the op portunity to play a more significant role in the growing popular demand for the integrative medical practices in which natu ropathic physicians are trained. Key opportunities 2012 Key opportunities 2012 Key opportunities 2012 Key opportunities 2012- ---2015 2015 2015 2015 The capacity to train naturopathic physicians has i ncreased significantly (the number of naturopathic medical s chools has more than doubled in the past 20 years), and gradua ting class sizes are increasing. There is a larger and better qualified applicant pool available to the schools. Competenci es and outcomes have been clearly defined for accredited s chools and are regularly updated as the profession develops. A ll of these factors position the profession to take advantage o f the opportunities that are presenting themselves, inclu ding: There is a growing need for primary care providers, particularly in light of the increased number of Am ericans 154 | Section I who have access to health care due to the 2010 Affo rdable Care Act. The naturopathic profession's greatest st rength lies in its ability to help address this need. Furthermo re, the number of conventional medical students pursuing pr imary care/family care has been decreasing (down to 24% i n Canada), leaving a void which NDs can help fill. There is an emerging epidemic of chronic diseases t raceable to diet, environment, and lifestyle (e.g., diabetes , hypertension, heart disease, gastrointestinal disor ders, environmental illnesses, allergies, etc.). Recognit ion by even the conventional healthcare profession of these eti ologic factors is making it clear that patients must accep t responsibility for their own health; it is vital th at patients have physicians with whom they can partner on this journey. Naturopathic physicians are trained to work with th eir patients, spending time to educate them on lifestyl e factors. Consequently, the services naturopathic physicians have to offer are in greater demand than ever before. There are diverse practice opportunities for naturo pathic physicians that were unheard of twenty years ago. Naturopathic physicians increasingly work in clinic al settings with medical and osteopathic doctors, chir opractors, acupuncturists, massage therapists, and other CAM practitioners. Naturopathic physicians can be found in tribal clinics on Native American lands, in public health clinics, in cancer treatment centers, in integrative medical ce nters, in mental health clinics, in substance abuse programs, in corporate wellness programs, and at resorts and spa s. Collaboration is increasing among schools and other professional ND organizations for the growth and advancement of the profession and for greater acces sibility for patients. Naturopathic Medicine | 155 State and national healthcare reform are providing opportunities for greater integration of naturopath ic physicians into the mainstream healthcare system.

Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals While Ayurveda as a system is in its relative infan cy in the US as far as education, regulation, recognition, scope, a nd numbers of people practicing, it has a long historical traditi on in its region of origin, the Indian subcontinent. A translation of t he Sanskrit word Ayurveda is \"science of life.\" The written sou rce texts of this science are variously dated but are generally agreed to date to at least the beginning of the Common Era. Many s cholars suggest the written tradition is older, or at least a compilation of a more ancient oral tradition. The three primary te xts are the Charaka Information included therein is considered to be the genesis of classical Ayurveda. Other texts have added to the body of knowledge over time. Ayurveda focuses on an individual's relationship with his/her own body, mind, and spirit, and with t he natural world. These relationships begin with the five elem ents (earth, 164 | Section II water, fire, air, and ether/space) and how they com bine to create the three doshas : vata (air and ether/space), pitta (fire and water), and kapha (water and earth). Vata is light, dry, expansive, and changeable. Pitta is hot, intense, transformational , and sharp. Kapha is stable, heavy, solid, cold, and oily. Many physiological processes fall under these categories; movement is governed by vata, digestion and transformation by pitta, and in sulation and lubrication by kapha. According to Ayurveda, people have individual constitutional make-ups ( prakruti ), with unique proportionality of the doshas. When in balance, good health is expe rienced. When out of balance, disease is more likely to take hold. Importance is placed on disease prevention and main taining balance with the ever-changing forces of nature. Ba lance is not static, but is constantly shifting; individuals mus t adjust their practices, routines, and lifestyles to maintain bal ance. Ayurveda is not exclusive of modern medicine, and combines w ell philosophically and practically because of its incl usivity. Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data The National Ayurvedic Medical Association (NAMA) i s currently collecting information on people practici ng Ayurveda in the US. This data has not yet been publically re leased.

Man y Ayurvedic professionals are also yoga teachers and/ or yoga therapists. Concepts of Ayurveda are taught in yoga teacher training programs and are part of the core curricul um in the standards of the International Association of Yoga Therapists. Diverse collaborations are occurring in research se ttings, clinics, and hospitals. Education Education Education Education Ayurveda became initially visible in the US largely mainly through efforts of spiritual communities. In the 19 70s, the Transcendental Meditation (TM) community brought do ctors trained in India to the US to offer Ayurvedic consu ltations to meditators. Esteemed doctors, including Indian nati ves who came to the US to practice, Westerners who studied in India, and practitioners who trained in the West, have further ed the profession in the US. People practicing Ayurveda have varying educational backgrounds, including BAMS (bachelor of Ayurvedic medical science) degrees, MASc (masters in Ayurvedic science) degree s or, more recently, MD Ayurved (medical doctor of Ay urveda) degrees. Training programs exist outside the Indian system of education including certificate courses and master' s level and clinical doctorate programs. Each type enrolls and graduates students in the US. In addition to Western-style ac ademic programs, all schools feature an internship compone nt; some schools also have traditional apprenticeship models in addition to academic studies (above and beyond in-person int ernship required at all schools). Currently, schools are gr owing and 166 | Section II expanding their internship programs. Representative s from 30 US-based schools have met to discuss the developmen t of educational standards and scope of practice. As of 2012, 21 US- based schools have registered with NAMA, meet curre nt requirements and participate in the discussions on standards. Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification While Ayurveda is a licensed medical profession in its native India, and in countries including Nepal and Sri Lan ka, Ayurveda is currently not licensed in the US. Yet s elf-regulation of the profession is increasing as organizations, s uch as NAMA, work on standards. Several state organizations (in California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota and Washington) have m issions and goals involving licensure . Research Research Research Research A growing number of studies confirm the efficacy of many traditional treatments, such as the use of turmeric (Curcuma longa ), a spice valued in Ayurveda for its anti-inflamma tory and blood sugar regulating effects and bitter gourd ( Momordica charantia ) for diabetes prevention and treatment. The Transcendental Meditation community sponsors hundreds of scientific studies investigating the us e of meditation. Research into yoga therapy, which overl aps with Ayurveda, is on the rise. The study of Ayurvedic th erapies using a Western approach is still developing when compare d to other systems, and faces challenges as therapies are gene rally tailored to the individual rather than standardized for a pa rticular condition.

Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Philosophy, Mission, and Goals Holistic medicine is the art and science of healing that addresses care of the whole person\u2014body, mind, and spirit. Si nce 1978, the American Holistic Medical Association (AHMA) has be en helping transform conventional/allopathic medicine to a more holistic model. The practice of holistic medicine i ntegrates conventional health care with complementary and alt ernative medicine (CAM) therapies to promote optimal health and wellness as well as to prevent and treat disease. T he AHMA serves as an advocate for the use of holistic and i ntegrative medicine by all licensed healthcare providers. We a re the home for the collective voices of both those providing a nd those seeking more integrative healthcare. 172 | Section II 1. Optimal Health is the primary goal of holistic medical practice. It is the conscious pursuit of the highes t level of functioning and balance of the physical, environmen tal, mental, emotional, social and spiritual aspects of human experience, resulting in a dynamic state of being f ully alive. This creates a condition of well-being regardless o f the presence or absence of disease. 2. The Healing Power of Love . Holistic healthcare practitioners strive to meet the patient with grace, kindness, ac ceptance, and spirit without condition, as love is life's mos t powerful healer. 3. Whole Person. Holistic healthcare practitioners view people as the unity of body, mind, spirit and the systems in which they live. 4. Prevention and Treatment . Holistic healthcare practitioners promote health, prevent illness and help raise awar eness of dis-ease in our lives rather than merely managing s ymptoms. A holistic approach relieves symptoms, modifies contributing factors, and enhances the patient's li fe system to optimize future well-being. 5. Innate Healing Power. All people have innate powers of healing in their bodies, minds and spirits. Holisti c healthcare practitioners evoke and help patients utilize these powers to affect the healing process. 6. Integration of Healing Systems. Holistic healthcare practitioners embrace a lifetime of learning about all safe and effective options in diagnosis and treatment, which are selected to best meet the unique needs of the patie nt. The realm of choices may include lifestyle modification and complementary approaches as well as conventional dr ugs and surgery. Holistic Medicine | 173 7. Relationship-centered Care. The ideal practitioner-patient relationship is a partnership which encourages pati ent autonomy, and values the needs and insights of both parties. The quality of this relationship is an essential co ntributor to the healing process. 8. Individuality. Holistic healthcare practitioners focus patient care on the unique needs and nature of the person w ho has an illness rather than the illness that has the per son. 9. Teaching by Example. Holistic healthcare practitioners continually work toward the personal incorporation of the principles of holistic health, which then profoundl y influence the quality of the healing relationship. 10. Learning Opportunities. All life experiences including birth, joy, suffering and the dying process are profound l earning opportunities for both patients and healthcare prac titioners. Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Holistic medicine in the US was conceived and pract iced by medical doctors as early as the 1950s, building on the various complementary medical traditions of the US dating b ack to the mid-19th century. Currently, more than 1,600 physic ians (MDs and DOs) have been certified by the American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine (ABIHM). Scope of Practice Scope of Practice Scope of Practice Scope of Practice Scope of practice is defined by conventional medica l licensing statutes and agencies in all 50 states.

Education Education Education Education Many holistic physicians receive their graduate tra ining in another field and then become board-certified in ho listic medicine. The American Board of Integrative Holisti c Medicine (ABIHM) offers a board review course for physicians , using a defined, evidence-based curriculum. Conventional MD or DO training and licensing is the prerequisite for this board certification in holistic medicine. Many postgradua te fellowships are available in integrative medicine. A list of 21 fellowships is available here: http://www.abpsus.org/integrative-m edicine- fellowships. Holistic Medicine | 175 A new residency in integrative medicine\u2014Integrativ e Medicine in Residency (IMR) program\u2014is currently be ing piloted in eight family practice residency programs . It is currently in year three of its curriculum. IMR is a required, in- depth competency-based curriculum that is integrate d into a typical three-year family practice residency progra m. It utilizes a web-based curriculum, program-specific experiential exercises, and group process-oriented activities. Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Board certification has been available via examinat ion through the American Board of Integrative Holistic Medicine (ABIHM) since 1999. For more information, visit www.holisti cboard.org. The ABIHM is currently developing the American Boar d of Integrative Medicine (ABOIM) with the University of Arizona and other academic institutions under the administr ation of the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS). The ABOIM certification will involve a fellowship prerequisit e, which may be waived for physicians who have studied/practiced in tegrative medicine. Active ABIHM Diplomates will be partially eligible for a fellowship waiver. For more information visit : www.holisticboard.org and www.abpsus.org/integrativ e- medicine. Research Research Research Research Studies of clinical sites practicing integrative/ho listic medicine are underway to examine the impact of specific moda lities and therapies.

Philosophy, Mission, Goals Philosophy, Mission, Goals Philosophy, Mission, Goals Philosophy, Mission, Goals Homeopathic medicine is holistic, informed by scien ce, safe to use, and inexpensive. Homeopathy can be effective i n both acute and chronic disease and can be useful in many emerg ency 188 | Section II situations as well. It is a system of medicine that is unique and distinct from other systems, disciplines, or modali ties such as biomedicine, naturopathic medicine, herbal medicine , acupuncture, nutritional medicine, and mind-body me dicine. Homeopathy uses minute doses of natural substances to activate the body's self-regulatory healing mechanisms. It w as founded by Samuel Hahnemann over 200 years ago, although th e principles on which it is based have been utilized in healing for thousands of years. Since its inception, homeopathy has been used by people from all walks of life, all ages, an d in countries all over the world. Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Homeopathic medicine is the second most common form of alternative medicine in the world today and the mos t common in some higher income countries. 1 Homeopathic medicine was first introduced into the United States in 1825 where it flourished Homeopathy| 189 until around 1900 when the field began to meet oppo sition from conventional medicine. At that time, there were 22 homeopathic medical co lleges and 20 percent of physicians used homeopathic medicine. The number of current homeopathic practitioners in this country is estimated at 8500. 2 There are four subgroups practicing homeopathy in some form in the United States. Stand ards, regulation, licensure, and educational accreditatio n vary widely between these groups. Lay homeopaths: No training standards, testing or recognition. Member organization is National Center for Homeopat hy (NCH). Professional homeopaths: Not licensed as healthcare professionals; typically 850-1200 hours of training ; Council on Homeopathic Certification (CHC) tests; no extern al recognition, accreditation, or licensure; member or ganization is North American Society of Homeopaths (NASH). Hea lth freedom legislation covers these practitioners in s ome states. Registered homeopathic medical assistant: 300 hours of training required by state registration boards in Arizona an d Nevada; MD or DO supervision required. Licensed healthcare professionals: Training ranges from 200-300 hours to 1000 hours, depending on the field and the level of specialization. Scope of Practice Scope of Practice Scope of Practice Scope of Practice The scope of practice varies considerably from stat e to state and is defined by various licensing agencies as well as , in some states, health freedom legislation. Homeopathic lic ensing boards exist in Arizona, Connecticut, and Nevada for MDs/D Os; in 15 states a section of naturopathic medical board exam s is on homeopathy. 190 | Section II Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Integration Activities Homeopathic schools offer services in many off-site clinics. Examples of clinical areas of practice include fert ility, acute care, incarcerated adolescents, low-income Hispanic popul ation, substance abuse, homeless/free clinic, urgent care centers, and nursing homes. Homeopathic practitioners are sought out to provide expertise in the field of complementary med icine, including policy development, medical training, med ical research, and clinical applications of natural ther apies. Homeopaths Without Borders offers homeopathy volunteer services to individuals living in regions facing cr isis conditions. Combined degree programs are offered in homeopathic medicine and acupuncture. Education Education Education Education There are currently thirty homeopathic schools in t he US, fifteen of which are listed in the school directory of the North American Network of Homeopathic Educators (NANHE) and three of which are recognized by the Accreditation Commissio n for Homeopathic Education in North America (ACHENA), th e recognition body for homeopathic schools. ACHENA is actively pursuing recognition by the US Department of Educat ion. Naturopathic medicine is the only healthcare profes sion which requires homeopathic training based on Department o f Education-recognized accrediting standards for all of its practitioners. Some conventional medical schools an d residencies offer electives in homeopathic medicine . Homeopathy| 191 Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Laws regulating the practice of homeopathy vary fro m state to state. Usually it can be practiced legally by those whose license entitles them to practice a healthcare profession o r medicine (see Scope of Practice above). Health freedom laws in so me states allow the practice of homeopathy by non-licensed pr ofessionals. The Food and Drug Administration regulates the manu facture and sale of homeopathic medicines in the US. The Ho meopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States was written into federal law in 1938 under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, making the manufacture and sale of homeopathic medicines l egal in this country. 3 Since homeopathic remedies are sold over the count er, people in all states are free to use them for self- care at home. Graduates of schools are eligible to test for natio nal certification through various certifying organizati ons, the largest of which is the Council for Homeopathic Certificati on (CHC). Though the conventional medical doctor (MD) and chi ropractic professions each have specialty certification exams , the naturopathic doctors use the CHC exam. Research Research Research Research The homeopathic profession has been conducting rese arch for over 200 years. Several hundred studies have been p ublished in recent years in clinical homeopathic research. A le ading organization for homeopathic research is the Societ y for the Establishment of Research in Classical Homeopathy ( SERCH).

The lead organization in that movement is the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integ rative Medicine (CAHCIM). CAHCIM is composed of 54 North American academic he alth centers and health systems which have active progra ms in at least two of the three areas of education, clinical care, and research in integrative medicine and have support a t the Dean's level or above. The Consortium defines integrative medicine as \"...the practice of medicine that reaffirms the impor tance of the 196 | Section II relationship between practitioner and patient, focu ses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes us e of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcare prof essionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and heali ng.\" The Consortium started with eight schools in 1999 a nd, with the generous support of the Bravewell Philanthropic Collaborative for infrastructure, has grown rapidly expanding to 23 schools by 2003, 36 in 2006, and 52 in 2012. For a complete list of member schools and other Consortium information, see the CACHIM website listed in the Resources section. The mission of the Consortium is \"to advance the pr inciples and practices of integrative healthcare within acad emic institutions.\" The Consortium provides its institut ional membership with a community of support for their ac ademic missions and a collective voice for influencing cha nge. The goals of the Consortium are: stimulate changes in medical education that facilit ate the adoption of integrative medicine curricula develop and promote policies and practices that enh ance access to integrative models of care undertake collaborative projects to promote and con duct research and disseminate the findings inform national policy that advances integrative me dicine through research, clinical, and education initiativ es With the voice of over one third of US and Canadian medical schools, the Consortium is poised to continue to ad vocate within academia for a relevant role for integrative medici ne, across all institutional missions. The Consortium and the Acad emic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC) have collaborated in planning two major international research conferences in 2009 and 2012 , and co-Integrative Medicine | 197 sponsored a conference on education in integrative health care in October 2012. Leadership and Working Groups Leadership and Working Groups Leadership and Working Groups Leadership and Working Groups The Consortium leadership is composed of an Executi ve Committee (EC) comprised of the Chair, Vice-Chair, Treasurer, Secretary, and the immediate past Chair, as well as four at-large members. Chairs of the Working Groups also sit on t he EC, as does the chair of the Membership Committee. The EC meets monthly by phone and in person twice annually. Offi cers are elected by a Steering Committee (SC), which consist s of one representative from each of the 54 member instituti ons. The SC meets in person twice annually. The Consortium is g overned by by-laws and is an IRS-recognized nonprofit 501(c)(3 ) organization. Education Working Group Education Working Group Education Working Group Education Working Group The Education Working Group (EWG) is continuously i nvolved in fostering projects in integrative medical educat ion. Previous projects have included creating a curriculum guide containing exemplars of integrative medicine teaching, authori ng an article on proposed competencies for a medical school curri culum in integrative medicine, and coordinating a grant to f oster mind- body training and curriculum among the Consortium s chools. There is now a Student Leadership Group which has e merged from the EWG, with student representatives from mem ber institutions, and there will soon be a resident/fel low group as well to serve students after they move on to postgr aduate training. Other current EWG projects include an eff ort to collect and assess existing tools for evaluating outcomes o f educational interventions in integrative medicine, and another to collect currently available online teaching resources from member institutions for more effective dissemination. 198 | Section II A major accomplishment of the EWG has been the \"Leadership and Education Program in Integrative Me dicine (LEAPS into IM)\" project, now entering its fourth y ear. This program, a collaboration with the American Medical Student Association and the Kripalu Yoga Center, offers a o ne-week, immersion-style training program in integrative med icine leadership to 30 medical students annually from acr oss North America. Clinical Working Group Clinical Working Group Clinical Working Group Clinical Working Group The Clinical Working Group (CWG) examines clinical initiatives across the member schools and shares expertise on c linical care, clinical models, and business issues, as well as fo stering clinical research. In addition to the core working group, th e CWG has created collaborations with several subgroups in sp ecific clinical areas, including integrative oncology, pediatrics, pain medicine, cardiology, integrative mental health, and financia l/business models. These groups meet on a regular basis via te lephone, offering talks to members from leaders in each part icular area. The calls are open to all Consortium members and ar e recorded and stored on the website for reference. The CWG wa s involved in planning content for the 2012 Annual Meeting on clinical models of care across the Consortium institutions. Research Working Group Research Working Group Research Working Group Research Working Group The Research Working Group (RWG) has created a netw ork of researchers from Consortium institutions to share t heir expertise and patient populations for recruitment in studies in integrative medicine. The RWG recently created four sub-groups to allow researchers with specific areas of interest to come together more readily for possible collaboration and collective l earning. These groups, which will meet regularly by conference cal l, are in the areas of cancer symptomology, workplace wellness, m odels of integrative healthcare and personalized healthcare. Integrative Medicine | 199 The RWG also plays a major role in planning the Consortium's Research Conference, for which members serve as contributors and scientific reviewers. In addition, in 2011, the RWG organized a very successful one-day research me eting following the Consortium Annual Meeting, which was attended by over 100 researchers and NCCAM leadership.

A priority of the PWG is to continue to monitor development and implementation of federal legislation and advise th e Consortium of opportunities related to Integrative Medicine. T he PWG also coordinates requests for testimony at Congressional briefings or other hearings pertaining to government policy. Fellowship Task Force Fellowship Task Force Fellowship Task Force Fellowship Task Force This ad hoc group was commissioned by the Consortiu m leadership in 2011 to develop a consensus set of co mpetencies for fellowship level education in integrative medicine. The Task Force has systematically reviewed existing competen cies and characteristics of currently available US integrati ve medicine clinical fellowships, and has drafted a set of stan dard integrative medicine clinical fellowship competencies. These dr aft competencies are currently being revised in prepara tion for publication.

Our mission is to establish yoga as a re cognized and respected therapy. IAYT published a definition of t he field in 2012 as part of our standards effort. In brief: Yoga therapy is the process of empowering individua ls to progress towards improved health and wellbeing thro ugh the application of the teachings and practices of y oga.... The practices of yoga traditionally include, but ar e not limited to, asana (postures), pranayama (breath control), meditation, mantra, chanting, mudra , ritual and a disciplined lifestyle. 1 In contemporary usage, the distinction between yoga and yoga therapy is not clear cut and depends, in part, upon the language used by different yoga lineages and method s and the context. In general, however, yoga therapy is an or ientation to the practice of yoga that is focused on healing, as opposed to 204 | Section II fitness, wellness, or spiritual support. It is ofte n taught privately or for special populations. Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Characteristics and Data Yoga is one of the most popular complementary and a lternative medicine (CAM) therapies - used by approximately 6. 1% of the adult population. The use of yoga, as well as medit ation and deep breathing (both considered yogic practices) al l appear to be on the rise.

There appears to be more and more integr ation with other practices, especially physical therapy, menta l health services and chiropractic. Almost 40% of the IAYT m embership holds a healthcare license in other fields, with th e top three being mental health, physical therapy and massage. Education Education Education Education The training of yoga therapists is most commonly pr ovided by private schools and/or supported by traditional yog a lineages. At least two certification courses are currently be ing offered by major universities in North America. At least three master's and one PhD program with a concentration in yoga therap y appear to be currently available or announced for 2012. On e actual Master of Science degree in yoga therapy from an ac credited university was announced in 2013. IAYT published voluntary educational standards for the training of yoga therapists in 2012 and will begin accrediting 206 | Section II training programs in 2013. Credentialing practition ers is expected to begin after the accreditation process i s firmly established. These standards are focused on compete ncies and require considerably more training than the majorit y of current training programs. The announcement of these standa rds appears to have spurred additional interest by inst itutions of higher education. Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Regulation and Certification Yoga therapy is an unregulated discipline. In the U S, the profession is represented by the International Asso ciation of Yoga Therapists (IAYT). IAYT is currently spearhead ing an effort to improve the professional status of the fi eld, including implementing training standards for yoga therapists , accrediting yoga therapy training programs, and, it is expected , eventually credentialing Yoga therapists. Currently, individual schools provide certificates to graduates. Credentialing by IAYT is on the horizon after the program accreditation process is established. To da te, the field has resisted outside regulation and licensing but, instead, has supported self-regulation through a voluntary stand ards process. Research Research Research Research The National Institutes of Health supports basic re search into yoga. Yoga is classified as mind-body medicine by t he National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM). IAYT is actively involved with promoting research i n the field of yoga therapy. The association successfully launc hed a standalone academic yoga research conference, the S ymposium on Yoga Research (SYR) in 2010, with over 200 atten dees (three times expectations). The second conference, SYR 201 1, was Yoga Therapy | 207 awarded an NCCAM R-13 scientific conference support grant. See the Symposium on Yoga Therapy and Research webs ite in the Resources section for current information on IA YT professional research conferences. Members of the association are active participants in the bi- annual integrative medicine research conference spo nsored by the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integ rative Medicine (CAHCIM). Each of the first three conferen ces featured a symposium on yoga research. IAYT's journal, the International Journal of Yoga Therapy (IJYT), was accepted by Pub-Med in 2011.

A key element for yoga is that, once trained, individ uals can practice without professional supervision. 208 | Section II The practice has grown tremendously over the past ten years, in part because the practice is so adaptable to the young and the old, the fit and the not-so-fit, the exercise enthu siast and the spiritual seeker. It is an especially suitable well ness practice for an aging population. Given the growth and popularity of the field in th e West in the past 10 years, the emerging research supporting its many healing properties, the growing acceptance of compl ementary and alternative therapies in general, and the high cost of conventional care, there are many opportunities to develop the field as a stand-alone healing practice or in conju nction with conventional and CAM healthcare fields. Since yoga is not a licensed practice, the practice is not constrained by insurance reimbursement practices. Organizations and Web Organizations and Web Organizations and Web Organizations and Websites sites sites sites The International Association of Yoga Therapists (I AYT) is a professional association with approximately 3,000 i ndividual members and 100 member schools in almost 50 countri es (as of 2013).

Toward Collaboration between the Disciplines: An ACCAHC Perspective 4. ACCAHCcronyms Appendix 1 Appendix 1 Appendix 1 Appendix 1 About the Academic Consortium for About the Academic Consortium for About the Academic Consortium for About the Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Complementary and Alternative Health Complementary and Alternative Health Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC)Care (ACCAHC)Care (ACCAHC)Care (ACCAHC) [We] envision a healthcare system that is multidisc iplinary and enhances competence, mutual respect and collaborati on across all healthcare disciplines. This system will deliver ef fective care that is patient centered, focused on health creation and he aling, and readily accessible to all populations. \u2014Vision Statement, Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care (ACCAHC) Endorsed March 2005; Amended July 2012 The idea of an organization like ACCAHC initially o riginated in a series of meetings beginning in the late 1990s: t he Integrative Medicine Industry Leadership Summits. Additional im petus was provided by the National Policy Dialogue to Adv ance Integrated Health Care (2001). In each instance, le ading educators in integrative practice recognized the va lue of creating a vehicle for ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue an d action. These seeds began to take formal shape in 2003 as a project of the Integrated Healthcare Policy Consortium (www.ih pc.info). The project evolved until the end of 2006 under the direction of Pamela Snider, ND, founding executive director of A CCAHC, and Reed Phillips, DC, PhD, founding ACCAHC chair. ACCAHC's key purpose was to bring educator leaders of the five licensed complementary and alternative healthc are professions into one room so they could jointly art iculate their shared issues and concerns about the evolving integ rative medicine dialogue. ACCAHC allowed educators to crea te one 214 | Appendices voice as they joined with their academic counterpar ts in conventional medicine in the 2005 National Educatio n Dialogue to Advance Integrated Health Care: Creating Common Ground (NED), which was led (under IHPC's auspices) by Joh n Weeks, Snider's successor as ACCAHC executive director. Once convened in the same room, however, ACCAHC's educator leaders realized there were many additiona l values in ongoing dialogue and collaboration. These educator leaders determined in mid-2006 that ACCAHC should seek to b ecome an independent entity to imbed this movement as a c ontinuing part of the landscape. ACCAHC was subsequently inco rporated as a nonprofit corporation, later obtaining Interna l Revenue Service recognition as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organ ization. Table A.1 lists the organizational members of ACCAHC, eac h of which pays dues based on the size of the organization. ACCAHC's core members are those councils of college s and schools, US Department of Education-recognized accr editing agencies, and nationally recognized certification a nd testing organizations from the licensed complementary and a lternative healthcare disciplines that choose to join. Current ACCAHC core membership includes 13 of these 15 organizations. I n addition, schools, colleges and universities affiliated with roughly two dozen of these accredited programs have chosen to j oin ACCAHC as individual institutional members. As we developed our structure, we also decided not to close the door on professions that are committed to great er self- regulation but have not yet met the benchmarks of t he licensed disciplines. Concerns were voiced that without such a membership provision ACCAHC would recapitulate the pattern of exclusion that has challenged the maturation pro cesses of the currently licensed professions. ACCAHC developed di stinct membership categories for two new groups, tradition al world medicines (TWM) and emerging professions (EP). At t his time, two TWM organizations related to Yoga therapy and A yurvedic Appendix 1 | 215 medicine and two EP organizations related to homeop athic medicine had applications for membership accepted, as indicated in Table A.1.

Membership funds roughly a fifth of basic operations with the remainder of operational funding and all major projects dependent on foundations, corpor ate, and individual philanthropy. We also plan to create add itional funding through the provision of resources that ass ist us in fulfilling on our vision. Donors that have assisted ACCAHC significantly in advancing our mission include ACCA HC's founding philanthropic partner Lucy Gonda, the West reich Foundation, the Lia Fund, the NCMIC Foundation, the Leo S. Guthman Fund, Standard Process, Inc., Bastyr Univer sity, Life University, Andrew Weil, MD, and the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine. The Instit ute for Alternative Futures provided us with significant in -kind support. Finally, ACCAHC is deeply grateful for the visionary leaders of the Integrated Healthcare Policy Consort ium out of whose multidisciplinary, collaborative work ACCAHC was born and then nurtured in its first years. ACCAHC's projects are led through the Board of Dire ctors, an Executive Committee, and three working groups, o ne each in the areas of research, education, and clinical care . The projects are diverse, and each includes a focus on supportin g inter- professional education, research, and clinical prac tice. Among current or recent projects are: developing the ACCA HC Competencies for Optimal Practice in Integrated Env ironments ; engaging productive dialogues with the NIH National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine over that ag ency's 2011-2015 strategic plan and the Patient Centered O utcomes Research Institute in its initial priorities; engag ing the emerging movement for interprofessional practice and educati on via diverse forums and relationship building including participation in the new Center for Interprofessional Practice an d Education; completing a project with UCLA Center for Health Po licy senior fellow Michael Goldstein on the role of licensed in tegrative Appendix 1 | 217 health disciplines in meeting the nation's primary care needs; and co-sponsoring the hugely successful Internation al Congress for Educators in Complementary and Integrative Medi cine at Georgetown University in October 2012 with our coll eagues in the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integ rative Medicine. This level of engagement stimulated significant int erest in ACCAHC playing a role in skill development for lead ership to bring the values, practices and disciplines associa ted with integrative health care into the broader dialogue o ver the future of medicine and health. The Board of Directors esta blished a Task Force on Leadership Development in 2011 to res pond to this need. One focus is on training individuals to serve as \"ambassadors\" or external affairs representatives t o diverse healthcare initiatives. These individuals act as tr anslators. They advance ACCAHC's values of whole person, health-foc used care in education, clinical services, research and polic y. At the same time, they help communicate and connect significant trends and developments in medicine and health to the ACCAHC community. ACCAHC representatives are currently serving such organizations and initiatives as: the Pain Action A lliance to Implement a National Strategy; the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded National Coor dinating Center for Integrative Medicine via the American Co llege of Preventive Medicine; the biennial Collaboration Acr oss Borders conference on interprofessional practice and educat ion; the National Quality Forum; and are engaged in dialogue with the leadership of the emerging National Center for Inte rprofessional Practice and Education. Of particular note is ACCAHC's work with three sign ificant projects of the Institute of Medicine of the Nation al Academy of Sciences. The first ACCAHC engagement was to suppor t consumer interest in distinctly licensed complement ary and 218 | Appendices alternative healthcare practitioners during plannin g and execution of the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Febr uary 25-27, 2009 National Summit on Integrative Medicine and th e Health of the Public. Conversations between leaders of ACCAHC and representatives of the IOM led to the appointment o f ACCAHC chair Elizabeth Goldblatt, PhD, MPA/HA to the IOM's planning committee. Goldblatt's service included helping for m valuable links between the conventionally trained practition ers and educators who were her colleagues on the committee and key professionals in the licensed complementary healthc are disciplines. The rich resources created through the Summit are available through the IOM's site http://www.iom.edu /?ID=52555. Subsequently, the IOM responded affirmatively to a suggestion from ACCAHC that a committee that was fo rmed to develop a national strategy for pain research, educ ation and care should include at least one representative from the licensed complementary healthcare disciplines. We made the c ase that many consumers use chiropractors, acupuncture and O riental medicine practitioner, massage therapist, Yoga ther apists and naturopathic doctors for pain-related conditions. A n ACCAHC nominee, Rick Marinelli, ND, LAc, a past president of the American Academic of Pain Management, was selected. We were pleased to see that the IOM report, \"Relieving Pain in America: A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, C are, Educa- tion, and Research,\" promoted an integrated, interp rofessional strategy directly referenced the contributions of comple- mentary and integrative therapies and practitioners . Most recently, with support from the Lotte and John Hecht Memorial Foundation, ACCAHC became a sponsoring organization of the 2012-2014 Institute of Medicine Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional Educatio n. Dr. Goldblatt is the IOM forum member, with John Weeks also active as an alternate. Among positive outcomes fro m the early engagement is a general understanding that optimal team care Appendix 1 | 219 will involve \"widening the circle\" of professionals and stakeholders who are considered part of these teams . ACCAHC's Board charged the Goldblatt-Weeks team to work on elevating consideration of innovations that lead to education of healthcare professionals who can not only react to and manage disease but also partner with patients and c ommunities to promote practices and choices that will lead to health and wellness. Meantime, ACCAHC is developing efficient means of translating the leading-edge thinking and content t o its councils of schools and their individual school and program members. More information on ACCAHC's areas of work, and accomplishments to date, are listed in Appendix 2, ACCAHC Accomplishments: January 2005-January 2013. A ACCAHC work in collaborative activity from 2005-200 9 is found in Appendix 3, entitled: Toward Collaboration betwe en the Disciplines.

The ACCAHC nominee who was appointed , Elizabeth Goldblatt, PhD, MPA/HA, was the only representative from non- conventional healthcare on the Committee. The meeti ng was significantly more multi-disciplinary in tone in pa rt through Goldblatt's representation of patient interest in the full scop e of practitioners involved in integrative medicine. Two National Pain Initiatives: IOM and Center for Practical Bioethics ACCAHC secured an invitation from the Institute of Medicine which ensured that ACCAHC member organizations would be r epresented on the IOM Committee on Pain Research, Care and Educat ion. Pain expert Rick Marinelli, ND, LAc was selected to serve on th e Committee. ACCAHC was invited to represent patient interest in comple mentary health care as a member of the Pain Action Alliance to Implement a National Strategy (PAINS) led by the Center for Practical Bioethics. Martha Menard, PhD, CMT sits on the PAINS steering committee and chairs a multidisciplinary ACCAHC Task Force on Integrative Pain Care that is informing her work. The Task Force is developing a paper on the potenti al value of complementary and integrative approaches in more ap propriately using opioids. Participating in the development of the NIH NCCAM 2011- 2015 Strategi c Plan: Setting Research Priorities The ACCAHC Research Working Group (RWG) led ACCAHC into continuing dialogue with the NIH National Center fo r Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The ACCAHC focus is on th e kind of \"real world research\" that is likely to most inform the ability of consumers and other stakeholders considering services from these discip lines. The RWG was particularly involved in the NIH NCCAM 2011-2015 St rategic Plan. In a series of letters, phone conferences and a face to face meeting, ACCAHC has underscored the importance of looking at whole practices, at cost issues and in building the capacity of these discip lines to participate in the research endeavor. See: http://accahc.org/image s/stories/2011- 15_strat_plan.pdf. A key role was in elevating the importance, as underscored by Congress, of looking not merely at t he impact of individual therapies, but at \"disciplines\" from whi ch consumers typically receive treatment. Work was led by Greg Cramer, DC, PhD and Carlo Calabrese, ND, MPH. The final NCCAM plan substantia lly reflected ACCAHC recommendations in this area. 222 | Appendices Patient- Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Through leadership of the Research Working Group (R WG), ACCAHC provided public comment on the new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) established under the Af fordable Care Act. In addition, two ACCAHC leaders were part of a panel a sked to present on complementary and integrative medicine at a Septemb er 2011 Listening Session for the PCORI Board of Governors. RWG found ing co-chair and member emeritus , Christine Goertz, DC, PhD, was appointed to serve on the PCORI Board. The RWG is also supporting submiss ion of a proposal on practice-based research network for integrative pra ctices, and engaged in a dialogue with PCORI CEO Joseph Selby, MD, MPH, the recording of which is here: http://accahc.org/images/Selby.mp3. The Movement for Inter- professional Practice and Education ACCAHC early recognized the importance of the value national and international movement toward team care and interpr ofessional education and practice (IPE/P) both for enhancing c are and as an opening to include the patient-centered interest in health-focused treatment and complementary and integrative practic es and disciplines. ACCAHC has: participated in the Collaboration Acros s Borders conferences (2011, 2013); development relationships with the Interprofessional Education Collaborative formed by academic councils for medical doctors, nurses, public health, osteopa thy, dentistry and pharmacy; developed relationships with leaders of t he National Center for Interprofessional Practice and Education and sp onsored an IOM Global Forum related to the subject. (See below.) O ur view is simple: in patient-centered movements such as this, the intere st of patients in integrative health practices and disciplines must b e at the table. Institute of Medicine (IOM) Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional Education In early 2012, the ACCAHC Board of Directors chose to invest in ACCAHC becoming a founding co-sponsor of the 3-year Instit ute of Medicine Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional E ducation. ACCAHC is the sole integrative health-focused sponsor of the forum, joining over 30 councils of colleges and professional associations from medicine, nursing, public health, pharmacy and other disciplines. ACCA HC's priority is to collaborate with the other forum members to explore innovations associated with graduating students who are expert in assisting individuals and communities toward wellness, self-c are, personal empowerment, prevention and health promotion. Parti cipation is made possible in part via an anonymous foundation grant. An IOM \"Spotlight\" on ACCAHC's Forum member Elizabeth Goldblatt, PhD, 'Ambassadors nizing both the opening opportunities for participa tion of individuals representing ACCAHC's values and discip lines in numerous healthcare initiatives, ACCAHC's Board formally end orsed pro-active outreach to place individuals in key dialogues, pro jects and initiatives. Among those with formal connections as of January 2 013: Integrative Medicine for the Underserved; International Congres s for Clinicians in Complementary and Integrative Medicine; Pain Action Alliance to Implement a National Strategy; and the HRSA-funded National Coordinating Center for Integrative Medicine of the American College of Preventive Medicine. Appendix 2 | 223 Publication of a Critically Needed Educational Tool ACCAHC created the Clinician's and Educator's Desk Reference on the Complementary and Alternative Healthcare Profession s to support all practitioners in understanding the value of the who le practices - not just therapies - our disciplines represent. Content is d eveloped by each council of colleges. The book has been widely heral ded across multiple disciplines. See quotes about the book here: http://accahc.org/images/stories/cedr_quotes_050511 .pdf. Integrative Health and Medicine in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and Patient- Centered Medicine Homes (PCMHs) The movement in policy, payment and practice toward models of care that allow payment for helping people to be healthy , avoiding costly procedures and surgeries, and stay well created an opening for complementary and integrative practices and provide rs. ACCAHC has developed a significant initiative in this area, re lated to Competency #6 (see below) of ACCAHC's competencies, via a task fo rce that includes a former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) seni or policy member who worked on the ACO language and an integrative m edical doctor with significant experience as a health system qual ity leader. The project is Strategic Support for Stakeholders in Exploring Int egrative Health and Medicine in Affordable Care Organizations and Patie nt-Centered Medical Homes . Engaging Relationships with MD Engaging Relationships with MD Engaging Relationships with MD Engaging Relationships with MD- ---RN RN RN RN----PhD Educators in PhD Educators in PhD Educators in PhD Educators in Integrative Health Integrative Health Integrative Health Integrative Health National Education Dialogue (NED) Led various projects for the National Education Dialogue to Advance Integrated Health Care: Creating Common Ground (2004-2006) which involved educators from 12 disciplines and fo cused on leaders of Consortium of Academic Health Centers fo r Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM). More Inclusive Definition of Integrative Medicine Collaborated with the now 54 -member CAHCIM to change their definition of \"integrative medicine\" to better resp ect the integration of whole disciplines by including the importance of integrating not just modalities but also healthcare professionals a nd disciplines. Research Conferences ACCAHC was a Participating Organization for the May 2009 North American Research Conference on Complementary and I ntegrative Medicine (NARCCIM), as it was for the 2006 meeting and again for the 2012, renamed, International Research Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health. ACCAHC leaders have served on key planning committees, prepared and had accepted multiple prog rams for presentation, and reported ACCAHC survey research a t poster sessions. Published Response on \"Competencies in Integrative Medicine\" Publication of a peer -reviewed paper which underscored the importance of integrating disciplines and practitio ners, not just therapies, in \"integrative medicine.\"(Response to a Proposal for an Integrative Medicine Curriculum, Journal of Alterna tive and Complementary Medicine. November 1, 2007, 13(9): 10 21-1034) 224 | Appendices Ongoing Dialogue with Integrative Medicine Educators ACCAHC has fostered and maintained collegial relati onships with CAHCIM. A highlight was a May 2009 gathering of rou ghly 40 people from each organization in shared working groups aft er which CAHCIM sponsored a reception and dinner. Key CAHCIM leaders are on ACCAHC Council of Advisers and informed dialogue s at the 2011 ACCAHC Biennial Meeting. ACCAHC working group membe rs are working on CAHCIM-originated projects and CAHCIM pa rticipants are working on some that originated with ACCAHC. International Congress for Educators in Complementary and Integrative Medicine ACCAHC co -sponsored with CAHCIM and Georgetown University for the first International Congress for Educators in C omplementary and Integrative Medicine October 24-26, 2012. This exem plar of \"horizontal integration\" included interprofessional teams on the planning committee and program committee and conten t distributed across various disciplines. ACCAHC's Ed ucation Working Group co-chair Mike Wiles, DC, MEd co-chaired the p rogram committee and ACCAHC EWG co-chair Jan Schwartz, MA, was among those who served on it. Over 340 educators, c linicians and researchers attended. ACCAHC staff directly support ed seven different presentations on such topics as competenc ies for practice in integrative environments. National Coordinating Council for Integrative Medicine/American College of Preventive Medicine ACCAHC supported a successful 2012 grant proposal o f the American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) that led to an award from the US Health Resources and Services Adm inistration (HRSA) to create a National Coordinating Center for Integrative Medicine. ACCAHC's current and founding executive d irectors, John Weeks and Pamela Snider, ND, respectively, serve on the steering committee for the project, as does Council of Advis ers member Len Wisneski, MD. Strengthening Collaboration among ACCAHC's Strengthening Collaboration among ACCAHC's Strengthening Collaboration among ACCAHC's Strengthening Collaboration among ACCAHC's Discipli nes Disciplines Disciplines Disciplines Interprofessional Collaboration Among the Whole Person-Oriented Disciplines While lumped as \"CAM,\" the disciplines that share i n common a whole person and health-focused view of health care have not historically collaborated closely to advance their shared values and projects. Via scores of conference calls and numero us face-to-face gatherings (February 2005, June 2005, May 2006, Oct ober 2007, July 2008, May 2009, May 2010, June 2011, October 2 012), now 17 key national and North American organizations acros s our disciplines have committed and re-committed year-af ter-year to collaboration as dues-paying members of a shared or ganization ($1000-$5000/year, depending on size). Organized Special Interest Groups (SPIGs) In order to foster mutual understanding and to enhance the abilities of our distinct organizations, ACCAHC con venes via phone conferences and face-to-face meetings SPIGs for Cou ncils of Colleges, for Accrediting Agencies, for Certificati on and Testing Organizations, and Traditional World Medicines/Emer ging Professions. Appendix 2 | 225 Presentations and Publications ACCAHC survey projects have been the subject of var ious posters and presentations: the 2006, 2009 and 2012 scientif ic meetings of the North American Research Conference on Complemen tary and Integrative Medicine (NARCCIM); the 2007 meeting of the Society for Acupuncture Research; the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; and the 2012 International Congress for Educators in Complementary and Integrative Medicine . Researching Competencies for Integration In a grant-funded project from the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, A CCAHC, working with others, carried out two surveys on com petencies of licensed acupuncturists for practice in MD-dominate d settings. A project on Hospital Based Massage Therapy is engagi ng a survey (2013) to support development of competencies for m assage practice in hospital settings. Clarified Priority Projects Once convened, ACCAHC identified core, major, multi -year projects in which members and participants could co llaborate in advancing patient care through advancing mutual res pect. Key areas identified as of January 2011 are: 1) support ing students, educators, clinicians and other stakeholders in wor king optimally in integrated environments; 2) supporting educators in developing evidence-informed education (via a collaboration wi th schools that received NIH-NCCAM R-25 grants to enhanced evi dence- based programs); 3) engaging the national dialogue to foster interprofessional education/care; and 4) developing programs and resources to support leadership in integrative heal th care. Competencies for Optimal Practice in Integrated Environment To support priority project #1, above, ACCAHC engag ed an 11 - month process involving over 50 professionals from 8 disciplines to create a document entitled Competencies for Opti mal Practice in Integrated Environments. Work was led by working group co- chairs Jan Schwartz, MA, Mike Wiles, DC, MEd, MS, M arcia Prenguber, ND and Jason Wright, LAc . ACCAHC leader s then merged this document with the subsequently-publishe d Core Competencies for Interprofessional Collaborative Pr actice of the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC). T hese Competencies, now endorsed by most of the ACCAHC co uncils of colleges, have been reported in various meetings an d shared with the IPEC leadership. Work is underway to create mat erials and programs, such as the ACO/PCMH project above, to tr anslate the Competencies into practice. Cross -Disciplinary Working Groups ACCAHC's core structure is based in 3 multidiscipli nary committees of leaders across our disciplines: Educa tion Working Group, Clinical Care Working Group and Research Wor king Group. In each, interprofessional teams independently set priorities that are aligned with the ACCAHC vision and mission. A m ultitude of projects have been engaged. 226 | Appendices Connecting Educators and Large Employers Members of the ACCAHC Research Working Group presen ted a special workshop to an April 2008 Institute for Hea lth and Productivity Management conference of large employe rs on the potential value of integrative services in the heal th of employees. The IOM Global Forum participation heightens the im portance of all health professional education connecting more c losely to real world interests. The ACO/PCMH project speaks direct ly to payment and delivery models long supported by employers. Visibility of the Mission ACCAHC was the s ubject of a May 2008 article in the peer- reviewed Explore: The Journal of Science and Healing! ACCAHC's work has since been referenced in multiple media in cluding Acupuncture Today , Integrative Medicine: A Clinician's Journal, The Huffington Post, Massage Today, Dynamic Chiropr actic, International Association of Yoga Therapists , and others. Philanthropic Support: Breaking the Glass Ceiling ACCAHC has begun developing a philanthropic base. Sustaining Donors have made 3-year pledges totaling up to $50, 000/year. ACCAHC's major initiative, the Center for Optimal I ntegration, will require that it break the \"glass ceiling\" that has kept significant philanthropy from investing in integrative projects that are not led by either medical doctors or, in rare cases, by nur ses. In late 2011, the Westreich Foundation granted ACCAHC $100,000 ov er 3 years, the first major commitment following ACCAHC's suppo rt from its founding philanthropic partner, Lucy S. Gonda. ACCA HC is actively seeking additional philanthropic leaders who will h elp remove this barrier to creation of optimal care.

Overview Overview Overview Overview This Desk Reference is offered as an educational to ol about the licensed complementary healthcare professions and r elated disciplines. Yet our purpose is more fundamental. O ur goal is to create a basis for better understanding and mutual respect between members of distinct healthcare disciplines, so that the health care patients receive will be enhanced. Coll aboration is the primary tool through which we will achieve that goal. This chapter explores collaborative activity betwee n educators in conventional academic medicine and edu cators from the disciplines represented in this text, part icularly the five disciplines with federally-recognized accrediting a gencies. These are acupuncture and Oriental chirop ractic, naturopathic medicine, direct-entry (home-birth) mi dwifery, and massage therapy. For these disciplines, significant local and nation al dialogue with conventional medical educators, and among them selves, emerged formally with the turn of the 21 st century. We begin with a description of some of the historical contex t for this 228 | Appendices activity, including recommendations from the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Health Care Policy 2, the Institute of Medicine 3, and the multi-stakeholder and multidisciplinary National Policy Dialogue of the I ntegrated Healthcare Policy Consortium. 4 We then focus on the actions and directions set by the collaborative National Education Dialogue (NED) to Advance Integrated Health Care: Creating Common Ground 5 and the Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternati ve Health Care (ACCAHC). We also note some cross-disci plinary educational initiatives of some members of the Cons ortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (C AHCIM), a group of now 54 conventional medical institutions a ctive in the integrative medicine field. This chapter includes s everal sidebars that shed useful light on the activities of some of these entities, and identifies priorities for action collaborativel y established by these mixed groups of academics. Finally, we have included some clarifying values, recommendations, and challenges encountered on this mission to improve health care. Dynamics Shaping the Emerging Interest in Dynamics Shaping the Emerging Interest in Dynamics Shaping the Emerging Interest in Dynamics Shaping the Emerging Interest in Co Co Co Collaboration llaboration llaboration llaboration As noted in the Introduction, the period from 1980 to the present has been one of significant expansion for schools, accreditation, licensing, and self-regulatory efforts among the li censed complementary healthcare professions. Communication and collaboration between the complementary and alterna tive healthcare disciplines and conventional medical pro fessionals have expanded over these decades, yet effective, wi despread engagement has only commenced in the last 15 years. A long history of exclusion and antagonism separated biome dicine from disciplines promoting holistic, integrative and nat ural healthcare Appendix 3 | 229 practices. Attitudes developed during that period s till influence and sometimes dominate the dialogue. Residual misunderstandings, mistrust, and often ignorance or iginating during that period of extreme polarization can stil l shadow efforts to create greater collaboration. But much n ew openness presently exists. Table A.2 offers a view of how that history of excl usion created attitudes and perceptions that can still af fect interdisciplinary relationships. The bottom line of the table, as with past interdisciplinary experiences, is that bo th conventional and complementary or integrative health providers t ypically saw patients who were the failures of their counter parts on the other side of the divide. Images of the other disci plines were, therefore, formed accordingly. Fortunately, the rift is on the mend. Many factors, including general sociocultural shifts toward holism, environ mentalism, internationalism and multicultural awareness, creat ed fertile ground for collaboration to take root and flourish. How this new acceptance originated continues to shape the nature of current collaborative activity. The following developments, therefore, merit special recognition. Opening through force: An antitrust lawsuit Opening through force: An antitrust lawsuit Opening through force: An antitrust lawsuit Opening through force: An antitrust lawsuit In 1990, the chiropractic profession concluded a 15 -year antitrust battle against the American Medical Association (AM A), Wilk vs. the AMA . The chiropractors' grassroots campaign led to a determination that the AMA had engaged in illegal r estraint of trade through such practices as excluding chiroprac tors from hospitals and forbidding AMA members from sharing p atients with chiropractors. Ending the era in which the AMA branded not just chiropractors but all non-conventional pra ctitioners as quacks or frauds created a potential for better-inf ormed dialogue between conventional medicine and all of the altern ative and holistic fields. 230 | Appendices Understandably, the attitudes and feelings engender ed by discriminatory actions are still present today. Med ical doctors educated in the earlier era are now in leadership p ositions in academic health centers and hospitals. Similarly, m any leaders in the complementary and alternative healthcare pro fessions entered their training in a highly adversarial atmo sphere. While both conventional and integrative health profession als from that earlier time are embracing the integration process, younger practitioners are typically more influenced by rece nt cultural trends and are more likely to have personally used integrative approaches in their own care or for that of family members. Public interest and demand Public interest and demand Public interest and demand Public interest and demand An extremely powerful force generating early moment um toward improving the flow of information and commun ication was the evidence that over a third of consumers in 1991 used some form of unconventional medicine and most chose not to tell their conventional providers about it 6. Originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 1993, then updated for the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998 7, the survey findings stimulated a fundamental shif t in perception among public officials, politicians, and members of the media. Alternative medicine users, it turned ou t, were everywhere. Hospitals, academics, insurers, politicians, and em ployers began exploring how to take advantage of this perva sive consumer interest. Subsequent national surveys have suggested that between 40% and 85% of healthcare consumers wi th chronic conditions typically try some form of non-conventio nal therapies or disciplines. The level of consumer use and estim ates of cash payments for these services piqued the interest of conventional stakeholders.

This initiative became the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine, whic h became the National Center for Complementary and Alternati ve Medicine (NCCAM) in 1998. The nation's academic hea lth centers, which had heretofore shown little interest in these fields, saw that federal money was a significant new factor in what had originated primarily as a consumer-led movement . New grant funding also supported the interests of conventiona l academics who saw value in researching nonconventional practi ces. NCCAM's annual budget was roughly $120 million in 2 008, most of which was distributed as grants to conventi onal medical centers. Over a dozen significant grants have gone to conventional academic health centers for education- related projects, most to members of the Consortium of Acad emic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine. Some of th ese conventional medical schools have had licensed comp lementary healthcare educator-researchers as advisers; some h ad AOM, chiropractic, massage or naturopathic institutions as partners. In many of these grants, NCCAM required applicants to have partnerships with complementary and alternative hea lthcare institutions. Likewise, NCCAM subsequently awarded a series of grants to complementary healthcare academic inst itutions, with a requirement that they have conventional part ners. Most of the current best practices in inter-institutiona l, collaborative action were initiated through these NCCAM grants. An ACCAHC analysis in 2010 estimated that just 4.6% or $60- million of total NCCAM funding between 1999 and 201 0 went directly to institutions that educate the distinctl y licensed integrative health disciplines represented in ACCAH C's membership. ACCAHC has sought to educate the NIH to the importance of increased direct granting to these in stitutions as a Appendix 3 | 233 critical foundation for building the scientific inf rastructure that is needed to underwrite optimal integration. Despite the limits in direct granting, a major infl uence for stimulating collaboration was the infusion of feder al money from NCCAM, which had been foisted on the NIH by Congressional action. Emergence of integrative medicine in conventional a cademic Emergence of integrative medicine in conventional a cademic Emergence of integrative medicine in conventional a cademic Emergence of integrative medicine in conventional a cademic health centers health centers health centers health centers Closely associated with the availability of researc h funding was the development of the concept of, and expansion of interest in, what is now called integrative medicine. In 1991, j ust one conventional medical school was known to have any e ducation relative to complementary and alternative medicine. By 1998, that number had reached 75. The Rosenthal Center fo r Complementary and Alternative Medicine compiled an extensive list of conventional schools offering cou rse work in CAM, and made the following comment on its website: \"At the time we archived the resource (June 2007) it is rar e that any conventional medical school would not have courses in complementary, alternative, or integrative medicine .\" In 2001, the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (CAHCIM) was formed by nine ac ademic health centers. To join, a center needed to have in stitutional support at the dean's level or above, and integrati ve medicine activity in at least two of the three core areas of healthcare academics (education, research, clinical services). By 2013, the number of CAHCIM members throughout North America h ad grown to 54. An organization of philanthropists, th e Bravewell Collaborative, provided significant backing for the emerging consortium. The development of CAHCIM created a new focal point for collaborative academic activity and shift ed the landscape in alternative medicine integration. 234 | Appendices Each of these factors opened doors for change agent s, inside and outside of mainstream medicine, who believed th at health care could be improved through fostering collaborat ion between conventional professionals and members of disciplin es that had historically been ostracized. Most of these profess ionals were integrative-oriented medical doctors, nurses, or ad ministrators, some of them cross-trained in a complementary and a lternative healthcare discipline or modality. Evidence of cons umer use allowed these individuals to more publicly promote dialogue, integration, and collaboration. Yet the ongoing work of these collaboratively-minde d professionals, and their partners in the complement ary and alternative healthcare disciplines, continues to be challenged by weak institutional support and, in some cases, phil osophical differences. The CAHCIM definition of integrative m edicine is clearly interprofessional, calling for the integrat ion of all \"appropriate healthcare approaches, health professi onals and disciplines,\" while other integrative medicine defi nitions focus on only integrating new therapies into conventional practices. For instance, an integrative medicine specialty bei ng developed through the American Board of Physician Specialties does not reference the importance of working in teams as a c ore principle. Optimally, integrative action would be advanced by a desire to understand why patients are drawn to these servi ces, and how care outcomes could be bettered, and/or medical costs reduced, by understanding and integrating these her etofore excluded practitioners. However, the ongoing instit utional commitments needed to support significant education al, economic, and cross-cultural integration initiative s has often been minimal, making progress very slow. Appendix 3 | 235 Promptings from a White House Commission, the Promptings from a White House Commission, the Promptings from a White House Commission, the Promptings from a White House Commission, the Institute of Medicine, and a Policy Initiative Institute of Medicine, and a Policy Initiative Institute of Medicine, and a Policy Initiative Institute of Medicine, and a Policy Initiative Beginning in 2001, three significant national initi atives provided intellectual and policy-related support for those w ho chose to begin promoting more exploration of interdisciplina ry activity between conventional and complementary and alternat ive healthcare professions. The report of the White Hou se Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicin e Policy (NIH, 2002) urged that: ... agencies should convene conferences of the leader s of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving h ealth professions, and the public; of educational institu tions; and of appropriate organizations to facilitate the esta blishment of CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequen tly, the guidelines should be made available to the stat es and professions for their consideration. 2(pg. 99) The Commission endorsed ten guiding principles. One recognizes that \"partnerships are essential to inte grated health care.\" 2 (pg. xxiii) Cross-disciplinary understanding and respect are underscored: \"Good health care requires teamwork am ong patients, healthcare practitioners (conventional an d CAM) and researchers committed to creating optimal healing e nvironments and to respecting the diversity of all health care traditions.\" 2(pg. xvi) The 2001 National Policy Dialogue to Advance Integr ated Care: Finding Common Ground , which also published its findings in 2002, made similar recommendations. This multidi sciplinary and multi-stakeholder gathering of 60 leaders in in tegrated care reached consensus on a core recommendation to \"Esta blish a national consortium of conventional and CAM educato rs and practitioners.\" Such a consortium would: 236 | Appendices ... identify a core education for all conventional an d CAM educational institutions, created by educators from the respective institutions themselves to ensure that t he healthcare professionals of the future understand w hat all systems of health care can offer. This will result in healthcare providers, both conventional and CAM, le arning at an early point in their training what other syst ems and modalities offer. The consortium will develop educa tional standards to ensure that factual and accurate infor mation is taught across all disciplines and that the type of information is in accordance with the teachings and principles of the respective disciplines. 4(pg. 12) The policy-oriented gathering identified a possible need for a special accrediting entity for continuing education and ongoing governmental support for collaborative education: An interdisciplinary body will be created to accred it continuing education programs in CAM/IHC for all me dical disciplines so that medical, nursing, pharmacy stud ents and other health professions students and practitioners , whether conventional or CAM, continue to learn about and re spect the value of CAM and integrative healthcare approac hes. Federal support is necessary to fund training oppor tunities in integrative healthcare settings so that medical students and healthcare practitioners, whether conventional or CAM, can learn about integrative approaches in order to provide better and more cost-effective patient care. 4(pg. 11-12) Finally, in 2005, the Institute of Medicine publish ed a Report on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the Un ited States , which acknowledged both the growth of the field and the central importance of collaborative and interdisciplinary a ction: Appendix 3 | 237 The level of integration of conventional and CAM therapies is growing. That growth generates the nee d for tools or frameworks to make decisions about which therapies should be provided or recommended, about which CAM providers to whom conventional medical providers might refer patients, and the organizatio nal structure to be used for the delivery of integrated care. The committee believes that the overarching rubric that should be used to guide the development of these tools sho uld be the goal of providing comprehensive care that is sa fe and effective, that is collaborative and interdisciplin ary, and that respects and joins effective interventions fro m all sources. 3(pg. 216) The report speaks directly to the problems that may arise if integrative medicine confines itself to the best us es of distinct approaches and therapies instead of honoring a medi cal pluralism that respects significant differences in \"epistemological framework(s)\" of practitioners fro m different disciplines. Yet, care must be taken not to assume compatibility where none exists. Medical pluralism should be distinguis hed from the cooptation of CAM therapies by conventiona l medical practices. (Kaptchuk and Eisenberg, 2001) Although some conventional medical practices may se ek and achieve a genuine integration with various CAM therapies, the hazard of integration is that certai n CAM therapies may be delivered within the context of a conventional medical practice in ways that dissocia te CAM modalities from the epistemological framework that guides the tailoring of the CAM practice. If this o ccurs, the 238 | Appendices healing process is likely to be less effective or e ven ineffective, undermining both the CAM therapy and t he conventional biomedical practice. This is especiall y the case when the impact or change intended by the CAM therapy relies on a notion of efficacy that is not readily measurable by current scientific means. 3(pg. 175) It is noteworthy that, while this comment urges res pect for distinctions between the disciplines, the report it self focused significantly more on integration of therapies than on integration of disciplines. A search by medical journalist Elai ne Zablocki found that, in the IOM report, \"CAM therapies\" appe 299 times, \"CAM practitioners\" 66 ns\" is used eight times, and \"CAM disciplines\" is used twice. T he internal dialogue that was framed was one of grafting trunca ted therapies rather than the integration of discipline s, with all of their distinct differences and cultures. While the decisions of many consumers of medicine h ave already provided ample reason for members of our di verse disciplines to learn to interact more closely, thes e three national initiatives added necessary perspectives on policy and medical leadership. Initial Conventional Explorations in Collaborative Initial Conventional Explorations in Collaborative Initial Conventional Explorations in Collaborative Initial Conventional Explorations in Collaborative Education Education Education Education Between 2000 and 2005, 14 conventional medical and nursing schools and one family medicine residency program r eceived multi-year grants from the NIH NCCAM as part of the Complementary and Alternative Education Project. Th e October 2007 issue of Academic Medicine (Vol. 82, No. 10) devoted 50 pages to nine reports based on these experiences. O f particular relevance to ACCAHC and educators in complementary and alternative healthcare institutions is an article b y Anne Nedrow, Appendix 3 | 239 MD and others about the four academic health center s that formed collaborative partnerships with nearby acade mic institutions that train CAM practitioners 8. Developers of these collaborative programs note tha t respect for the potential value of complementary and altern ative healthcare practitioners is enhanced by giving conv entional practitioners direct experience of these approaches in educational, clinical, and research settings. Medic al students at Georgetown University, for instance, report surpris e in learning, during shared gross anatomy lab, the high level of understanding of anatomy that massage therapists ar e required to achieve. Confidence of medical students in worki ng with complementary healthcare practitioners increased si gnificantly with personal experience of the therapies among a g roup of medical students at the University of Minnesota 9. Nedrow's integrative medicine program at the Oregon Health and Science University forged ties with Western Sta tes Chiropractic College (now called the University of Western States), National College of Natural Medicine (wher e the dominant program is naturopathic medicine), and Ore gon College of Oriental Medicine to form the Oregon Col laborative for Integrative Medicine. Nedrow's conscious effort to put all of the participants in a non-hierarchical relationship , dubbed \"lateral integration,\" was well-received by the com plementary healthcare educators. Nedrow has reported that barr iers between professionals of different disciplines can be diminished when it is educators who are seeking to collaborate . The shared mission of educators to optimize the education of t heir students becomes the basis for open-minded collaboration. Nedrow and her co-authors anticipate that such collaborations will increase. A key emerging issue they identified is credentialing of complementary health care practitioners to teach within conventional health p rofessions institutions. The authors recognize that collaborat ion involves 240 | Appendices development of respect even in a context of signifi cant differences. One proposed solution is to teach comp lementary health care \"as an aspect of cultural sensitivity.\" One sign of emerging openness to collaboration with members of other disciplines is that, by 2007, scho ols belonging to CAHCIM (for which Nedrow and her co-authors have been leaders) included faculty members who are also lice nsed members of the chiropractic, acupuncture and Orient al medicine (AOM), and naturopathic medical professions. These dually credentialed educators are presently serving on CAH CIM working groups and participating in their annual co nferences. Beginning in 2009, three of these licensed compleme ntary healthcare professionals served CAHCIM as co-chairs of their working groups. In 2013, a naturopathic physician, Ather Ali, ND, MPH, represented Yale Integrative Medicine on t he CAHCIM steering committee. Engaging a National, Multidisciplinary Collaboratio n Engaging a National, Multidisciplinary Collaboratio n Engaging a National, Multidisciplinary Collaboratio n Engaging a National, Multidisciplinary Collaboratio n In 2004, amidst this rapidly developing environment , the National Education Dialogue to Advance Integrated H ealth Care: Creating Common Ground (NED) was engaged by the Integrated Healthcare Policy Consortium, which birt hed ACCAHC. By design, many of the leaders of CAHCIM, a s well as the founders of ACCAHC, were involved in the 25- member planning team. NED ultimately included educators fr om 13 disciplines at a four-day meeting of 75 educators i n mid-2005 (see Table A.3). A parallel process involved the cr eation of ACCAHC during the same time period (described in Ap pendix 1). Appendix 3 | 241 Table A.Table A.Table A.Table A.33 33 Disciplines of Educator Participants in the Nationa l Disciplines of Educator Participants in the Nationa l Disciplines of Educator Participants in the Nationa l Disciplines of Educator Participants in the Nationa l Education Dialogue Education Dialogue Education Dialogue Education Dialogue Acupuncture and Oriental medicine* Acupuncture and Oriental medicine* Acupuncture and Oriental medicine* Acupuncture and Oriental medicine* Chiropractic* Chiropractic* Chiropractic* Chiropractic* Holistic medicine Holistic medicine Holistic medicine Holistic medicine Holistic nursing Homeopathic medicine Homeopathic medicine Homeopathic medicine Homeopathic medicine medicine* Naturopathic medicine* Nutrition/dietetics Occupational medicine Occupational medicine Occupational medicine Occupational medicine Osteopathic medicine Public health Public health Public health Public health Yoga therapy** *ACCAHC core disciplines. **Yoga therapy, while not a licensed practice, is i nvolved in ACCAHC as an emerging, Traditional World Medicine discipline. The 15 months of NED planning revolved around identification and development of a series of proje cts designed to provide content for the onsite meeting to consider. One project was a survey of all of CAHCIM's integrative medicin e programs (then 28) and all of the accredited schools and pro grams from the ACCAHC disciplines (then 130) to gain baseline data on the \"Status of Inter-Institutional Relationships betwee n CAM Disciplines and Conventional Integrative Medicine P rograms.\" Sample findings: Few of the then-28 CAHCIM member programs had forma l classroom or clinical relationships with any comple mentary and alternative healthcare schools or colleges. The greatest involvement was found with AOM schools (32% for classroom, 16% clinical) and massage schools (20% classroom, clinical). Belief that developing \"stronger, multi-dimensional , interdisciplinary relationships\" is key healthcare system\" was strong; 85% of CA HCIM respondents and 86% of the ACCAHC respondents agree d. Sharing documents and strategies on best practices was viewed as the most beneficial strategy to support m ore inter-242 | Appendices institutional relationships (73% of CAHCIM and 77% of ACCAHC). In addition, a set of survey questions directed onl y at ACCAHC programs found that a majority of respondent s had diverse clinical care relationships with convention al delivery organizations in their communities. Among these wer e community clinics (48%), hospitals (28%), senior ho mes (43%), and homeless clinics (33%). Such participation was highest in the naturopathic medical field, followed by chiropracti c and AOM. The data suggested that integrated clinical service s might take place in these off-campus environments, many of whi ch were already linked to conventional residencies and clin ical training experiences. Clarifying the core competenciClarifying the core competenciClarifying the core competenciClarifying the core competencies of integrative med icine es of integrative medicine es of integrative medicine es of integrative medicine A second, multidisciplinary survey was stimulated b y the response of ACCAHC participants to the publication of a CAHCIM-endorsed paper in Academic Medicine on competencies in integrative medicine. 10 The paper was developed internally by CAHCIM, without input from leaders of the ACCAHC disciplines. A modified Delphi survey administered to a subset of 18 complementary healthcare educators representi ng all the ACCAHC core disciplines eventually elicited five ke y areas of concern with the competencies endorsed by CAHCIM. 11 Most of the concerns relevant to the core issue of integrat ion were not focused solely on therapies, but on an active engag ement between diverse disciplines. The survey found that: The CAHCIM paper leaves the impression that convent ional medical physicians may simply incorporate into thei r practices what they perceive to be good CAM therapi es rather than referring to or co-managing and collabo rating with CAM providers. Appendix 3 | 243 The CAHCIM paper does not include the option of integrated care with MDs and CAM practitioners as partners, and seems to propose that CAM be an add-o n to conventional medical care. Occasionally in the paper, language appears to refl ect a continuation of the 'us and them' mindset rather th an seeing that CAM providers, faculty, and systems could and should be part of IM. The paper gives the impression that conventional me dical institutions want to include CAM, but not necessari ly CAM practitioners, in their vision of IM. CAM is defined in relationship to biomedicine as complementary or alternative, but is considered int egrative if delivered by conventional physicians. 11(pg. 1023) The issue of the distinction between integration of therapies versus the more challenging and the significantly m ore beneficial work of collaboration between discipline s led to a process in which CAHCIM changed its definition of i ntegrative medicine to better reflect the importance of workin g with other disciplines (see Sidebar A.1). Efforts to create shared values to guide interEfforts to create shared values to guide interEfforts to create shared values to guide interEfforts to create shared values to guide interdisci plinary action disciplinary action disciplinary action disciplinary action A third project, led by holistic nurse educator Car la Mariano, EdD, RN, AHN-BC, FAAIM, sought to clarify a shared set of values across the disciplines involved with the NED process. The vision behind this project was of a document that m ight be co- produced by a multidisciplinary NED team and endors ed by the NED planning committee and then amended and endorse d by the onsite gathering of 75 educators. If agreement were reached, the document could then be taken to the individual disciplines for endorsement as a shared basis for interdiscipli nary action.

The hope and expectation among educators and practi tioners was that such educational collaboration would translate into more understanding and greater cooperation among practitioners. The organi zing mantra was those who learn together practice together . What could educators do to help get their disciplines out of separate silos and break d own the historic barriers between conventional and alternative professions? A n early step was to clarify the shared vision, if any, unifying the lea ders. The group agreed on this statement: We envision a healthcare system that is multidiscip linary and enhances competence, mutual respect and collaboration across all complementary and alternative medicine and conventional healthcar e disciplines. This system will deliver effective care that is patient centered, focused on health creation and healing, and readily accessible to all populations.5(pg. 1) A funny thing happened on the way to working on thi s vision. On the December 2004 NED planning team call, one of these p lanners announced that at the recent general meeting of CAHCIM, the co nventionally-based academics had agreed on a definition of integrative medicine. Integrative medicine is the practice of medicine tha t reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and make s use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches to achieve optimal health an d healing.5(pg.16) The successful agreement among representatives from the 25 medical schools on a definition of their field had taken mon ths of committee work. The eight members of the NED planning team who also were members of CAHCIM were congratulated. But this definition was not well received by many o n the call. The first issue was participatory: if integrative medicine was inte nded to be inclusive, then why were leaders of other disciplines not asked to collaborate on establishing the definition? The second issue was s ubstantive and went to the heart of collaboration. Where in that definitio n was the evidence that a practitioner of integrative medicine must, in the w ords of the NED vision, be \"multidisciplinary and enhance(s) competence, mutua l respect and Appendix 3 | 245 collaboration across all complementary and alternat ive medicine and conventional health care disciplines\"? One responsibility that ACCAHC had in the NED proce ss was to articulate and advance shared issues relating to the cultural- medical shift toward more integrated health care. That the definition of inte grative medicine included no reference to the importance of knowing how to co llaborate with other types of healthcare professionals and disciplines w as one issue. There were others. The word \"approach,\" for instance, did not appropriately characterize the unique contributions of practitioners licensed in the 4000-year-old discipline of acupuncture and Oriental medicine. ACCAHC members asked their CAHCIM colleagues to chan ge their definition of integrative medicine. The request was well recei ved. A conventional colleague noted that the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, in its Report on Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States , had underscored the importance of care that is \"col laborative and interdisciplinary and that respects and joins effect ive interventions from all sources.\" The CAHCIM definition was formally amended to read: Integrative medicine is the practice of medicine tha t reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and make s use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, hea hea hea healthcare professionals and disciplines lthcare professionals and disciplines lthcare professionals and disciplines lthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing [amendment in bo ld type].5(pg.16) In short, integrative medicine requires more than in tegration of specific therapeutic approaches. This definition was used wi dely in the 2009 Institute of Medicine Summit on Integrative Medicine and the H ealth of the Public. Practitioners must also know how to make the best u se of other healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal he alth and healing. Notably, the amended definition also elevated the status of a ll non-medical, non-CAM disciplines including nurses, physical therapists, psychologists, nutritionists, and others. A definitional platform was laid for an emerging vision of an integrated healthcare system that will require all disciplines to recognize that they must work as part of respectful, collaborative teams. A brief coda: A brief coda: A brief coda: A brief coda: Several years of living with the defi nition have revealed one other area where some in the complementary healthca re community might prefer an additional amendment. While the definition does not say that it only refers to practice by medical doctors, many re ad the definition as MD- centric. Clarity that it is the \"practice of medici ne, by members of any discipline \" would be a more inclusive framing. 246 | Appendices Task Force was that the process of shifting the dis ciplines out of their historic isolation would benefit from a colla boratively- developed guiding document. Through a series of phone meetings, a small work gr oup created a draft statement of core values. These were couple d with examples of knowledge and skills associated with ea ch of the values. The Task Force as a group endorsed the stat ements as a working document. The core values served as the bas is of an intensely interactive World Caf\u00e9 format for the 75 educators at the onsite NED meeting. (See the text of the draft document in Sidebar A.2.) The participants at the gathering pro ved to be a long way from consensus on the document. There were contradictory feelings about the ultimate contribut ion such a document might have, even though an onsite survey s trongly supported continuing the work \"to create a concise statement of core values which have resonance across the discipl ines and can guide efforts to create quality integrated healthca re education.\" A reconstituted Task Force continued work via a ser ies of phone meetings after the onsite meeting. They found two resources of particular value in guiding their acti vity together. One was the section on practitioner to practitioner relationships in the Pew-Fetzer seminal document on relationship- centered care. (Further information on the report's findings is provided in Table A.4.) Particularly noteworthy were issues rel ated to knowledge of self, ability to understand the \"histo rical power inequities across the professions,\" \"affirmation of the value of diversity,\" and the importance of team dynamics. 12 The second guiding document for the team's work was the Four Quadrants from Ken Wilbur's Integral Theory of Consciousness .13 The group quickly noticed that much of the integration activity has been shaped by the right q uadrants, which are related to exterior inputs such as random ized controlled trials, publications, and capacity to pa rticipate. The Values Working Group engaged an internal process to explore Appendix 3 | 247 the way that subjective issues such as self-knowled ge, personal involvement in health, and appreciation of the dive rsity of professional experience and culture influence colla borative behavior. Model Education Tools on the Disciplines Model Education Tools on the Disciplines Model Education Tools on the Disciplines Model Education Tools on the Disciplines We recognize that expanding and strengthening integ ration and collaboration will require some remedial education. Practitioners of one healthcare system cannot effectively collabo rate with practitioners of other systems unless they first po ssess accurate and adequate knowledge of and understanding about t he various healthcare disciplines that exist. (This bo ok reflects one effort to correct shortcomings.) The decades of sep aration between conventional and complementary healthcare disciplines, between the mind and body, and between the physical locations of our educational institutions and clinics, underscore the importance of such education. A well -formulated survey course, or set of courses, would provide an important basis for opening hearts and minds to the \"other,\" with the ultimate and critical goal of serving patients more effectively. There are numerous strategies to enhance collaborat ion and to train all practitioners about disciplines other than their own. Dialogue is vital. As practitioners become better a ble to discuss healthcare options outside of their own fields with both patients and other practitioners, they can better understand treatments patients may already be receiving from other health care practitioners. Cross-referral will be enhanced as p ractitioners develop openness to other medical cultures and para digms.

Practice as Combined Art and Science Practice as Combined Art and Science Practice as Combined Art and Science Practice as Combined Art and Science We value competent, compassionate, relationship-cen tered practice that honors intuitive knowledge, stimulates creativity i n the face of divergent circumstances, and appropriately utilizes a network of diverse practitioners as integral to the practice of the healing arts. Th is approach is informed by in-depth education, critical thinking, reliable evi dence from well-designed quantitative and qualitative research, and by respe ct for diverse theories and world views. Appendix 3 | 249 SelfSelf SelfSelf----Care of the PractitionerCare of the PractitionerCare of the PractitionerCare of the Practitioner We value a practitioner's commitment to self-reflec tion, self-care, and to his or her personal growth and healing as being essenti al to one's humble ability to provide the most effective and enduring health care to others. Interdisciplinary Collaboration Interdisciplinary Collaboration Interdisciplinary Collaboration Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Integration and Integration and Integration and Integration We embrace the breadth and depth of diverse healthc are systems and value collaboration of all providers within and across di sciplines and with clients/patients and their families.

It is based on work led by Elizabe th Goldblatt PhD, MHA/PA and Daniel Seitz, JD, involving a team of eight professionals from four disciplines; the informatio n was presented at the NED onsite gathering. To transmit adequate knowledge in an academic setting, representatives o f each discipline recommended at least 2-3 credits or 30-4 5 course hours on each discipline. However, already bulging educational requirements in all the health professions schools effectively vetoed such an approach.

Collaboration following the NED meeting Collaboration following the NED meeting Collaboration following the NED meeting Collaboration following the NED meeting Significant efforts were made to find philanthropic support that would allow the NED work groups to remain intact an d begin addressing these priorities. Limited funds were rai sed to advance the values initiative and some interdiscipl inary collaboration, but unfortunately the broader NED ef fort had to be suspended roughly a year later. The effort's epi taph was provided while NED was still robust by the chair of the Institute of Medicine committee that produced the 2005 report on complementary and alternative health care in the US : \"What you are doing [with NED], this great collaborative work , is one of the most important things anyone can do to implement th is report.\" 5(pg.1) 254 | Appendices Activity to advance the collaborative agenda has co ntinued on many fronts. Leaders of ACCAHC chose to take wha t was originally a project of the IHPC and create an inde pendent organization as a basis for ongoing interdisciplina ry action. As noted in the introduction, ACCAHC was formally inco rporated in 2008 and has gathered increased participation fr om leaders of the licensed complementary healthcare professions a s well as Traditional World Medicines and emerging profession s organ- izations which are engaging self-regulatory and reg ulatory efforts. (See the Introduction for more information .) Cross-fertilization between the CAHCIM and ACCAHC h as also continued. Executive teams met in 2006, and, i n 2009, as noted above, roughly 80 leaders, evenly split betwe en the two organizations, met for a half day to explore formal collaboration on various projects. The International Congress for Educators in Complem entary and Integrative Medicine (ICECIM) at Georgetown Uni versity in October 24-26, 2012 marked a culmination of this co llaborative movement. This gathering, promoted by Aviad Haramat i, PhD, an ACCAHC Council of Advisers member, was co-sponso red by CAHCIM and ACCAHC together with Georgetown Universi ty. The ICECIM planning team, program team, funding gro up, presenters and participants all exemplified the int erprofessional principal of \"horizontal\" collaboration and mutual respect. An outpouring of over 230 submissions led to a multidi sciplinary turnout of roughly 350 educators, researchers and c linicians. A special issue of the peer-reviewed Explore magazine, planned for late 2013, will feature content from the meeting. The infrastructure for collaboration continues to g row. The ACCAHC Council of Advisers includes numerous leader s of CAHCIM. Content at the ACCAHC Biennial Meetings in 2011 and 2013 focus on areas of collaboration and includ e CAHCIM leaders. Increasingly, medical doctors can be found as members of ACCAHC Task Forces and Working Groups. In fact, in 2013 Appendix 3 | 255 an integrative medical doctor, Molly Punzo, MD, a l ong-time member of the ACCAHC Clinical Working Group, was se lected to lead an ACCAHC Task Force that is focused on the contributions that integrative health modalities an d disciplines can have in meeting the patient experience, populat ion health and cost-saving goals of the \"Triple Aim\" that is d riving health system reform. Competencies for Optimal Integration and the Competencies for Optimal Integration and the Competencies for Optimal Integration and the Competencies for Optimal Integration and the Opportunity in Interprofessional Education Opportunity in Interprofessional Education Opportunity in Interprofessional Education Opportunity in Interprofessional Education Early on, ACCAHC leadership recognized that educati on in the ACCAHC disciplines had in common that they typicall y educated their students in discipline silos to go o ut to practice in silos. The emerging opportunities for collaborative , integrative practices called for new competencies. In late 2009, in response, ACCAHC's leadership and its core five disciplines set as its central agenda creating what the organization published 11 months later as Competencies for Optimal Practice in Integrated Environments .14 ACCAHC subsequently learned that a separate collaboration of councils of schools for medicine, nursing, public health, pharm acy, dentistry and osteopathy, the Interprofessional Education Col laborative (IPEC), had engaged a parallel process and publishe d the Competencies for Interprofessional Education and Pr actice . An ACCAHC team, led by Michael Wiles, DC, MEd, MS, and massage educator Jan Schwartz, MA, led an effort to examine the potential integration of these two documents. The r e-drafted ACCAHC Competencies adopted the four IPEC competencies in total, while maintaining two other competencies fie lds related to \"Evidence-based Health Care and Evidence Informed P ractice\" and \"Institutional Healthcare Culture and Practice. \" These were subsequently endorsed by national educational organ izations from ACCAHC's core disciplines. IPEC was notified. That 256 | Appendices organization lists ACCAHC as a \"Supporting Organiza tion\" for their work. ACCAHC leaders viewed the patient-centered interprofessional education (IPE) movement as one t hat, on a principled basis, would be expected to be open to i ncreased collaboration and involvement from the ACCAHC disci plines. The organization invested in this in multiple venue s. ACCAHC was a sponsor of the major North American IPE confe rence in 2011, Collaboration Across Borders (CAB) III. The A CCAHC Competencies were the subject of a presentation. For the 2013, CAB IV meeting, ACCAHC was invited to name a member for the conference's Advisory Board. ACCAHC was instrum ental in bringing IPE leaders and content into the 2012 ICEC IM meeting in Georgetown. Most importantly, ACCAHC's Board of Directors made a major organizational commitment in January 2012 to become a sponsor and active participant in the Institute of Medicine Global Forum on Innovation in Health Professional E ducation in which IPE figures prominently. ACCAHC chair Elizabe th Goldblatt, PhD, MPA/HA serves as a member of the fo rum with ACCAHC executive director John Weeks also active as an alternative. Goldblatt was featured in a 2012 IOM \" Spotlight\" and was selected as part of a seven-person team to develop content for the Forum's 2013 workshops. Leadership in Knitting Together the Integrative Hea lth Leadership in Knitting Together the Integrative Hea lth Leadership in Knitting Together the Integrative Hea lth Leadership in Knitting Together the Integrative Hea lth and Conventional Disciplines and Conventional Disciplines and Conventional Disciplines and Conventional Disciplines A critical, long-term ACCAHC strategy for fostering better patient care through fostering mutual respect and i nclusion among the disciplines is to \"show up\" in major heal thcare dialogues. As ACCAHC has developed capacity through growing core membership, and more importantly, thro ugh philanthropic support that accounted for roughly 80 % of Appendix 3 | 257 operating revenues in 2012, the organization has fo cused on participating in core dialogues. A parallel and nec essary objective has been to develop a cadre of leaders wh o can represent integrative health values, practices and disciplines in such dialogues. Examples are growing. For instance, via a series of letters and meetings, ACCAHC leaders played an important role i n shaping aspects of the 2011-2015 strategic plan for the NIH NCCAM. Perspectives of ACCAHC participants are credited wi th elevating the visibility of complementary and alter native medicine in the plans for the Patient Centered Outc omes Research Institute (PCORI). ACCAHC involvement in t he IPE movement and the IOM Global Forum, noted above, has helped widen the circle of the types of practitioners view ed as valuable in team care. As noted above, ACCAHC is recognized as a supporting organization for the Interprofessional E ducation Collaborative. The development of the Pain Action A lliance to Implement a National Strategy (PAINS) as a national , multidisciplinary campaign to promote an integrated view of pain treatment has been shaped in part through the work of massage researcher Martha Menard, PhD, CMT, ACCAHC' s representative to the PAINS steering committee. ACC AHC executive director John Weeks was invited as an exp ert consultant to participate in two sessions of World Health Organization teams convened to develop a 2014-2023 strategic plan for traditional and complementary medicine. The culture is increasingly open to such perspectiv es, even as ACCAHC is seeking to develop the capacity to take a dvantage of the emerging opportunities to advance the kinds of collaboration which will lead to better patient car e. 258 | Appendices Summary Summary Summary Summary The past decade has seen significant development of the values, definitional commitments, and operational infrastru cture needed to support collaborative action and prepare the way for an integrated healthcare system. Conventional medicine , integrative medicine, and the licensed complementar y, alternative, and integrative healthcare professions must all continue to work on that goal for many years to com e. Collaborative action is already expanding despite t he historic estrangement between many of these fields. An ongoi ng challenge is to show how patients can benefit when practitioners of different stripes are not merely viewed as purve yors of therapies but as exponents of entire disciplines wi th their own rich histories and distinct approaches to patient c are. Strategies for enriching cross-disciplinary experiences in the midst of already excessive curriculum requirements must be d eveloped. To be urging additional coursework and clinical exp osures on heavily burdened health professions students puts a ll of us in an uncomfortable position. Yet multiple forces in the broader culture energize this effort. These range from cult ural shifts and consumer interests to top-level reports on the impo rtance of collaboration in the treatment of costly chronic di seases. Patient- centered care, patient-practitioner partnerships, a nd team medicine are all elements of renewed efforts to cre ate a medical system which is proactive and focused on health cre ation. A frequently quoted opinion among academic research ers concerning integrative and complementary healthcare themes is that one day we will no longer have conventional me dicine and alternative medicine, but only good medicine. Such a rosy resolution of the philosophical debates on diverse approaches to health and medicine that go back not just decades b ut centuries cannot be expected in the near future. However, we can all learn to collaborate more respectfully and effectively de spite our Appendix 3 | 259 differences, and that is certainly a part of good m edicine and very likely a necessary antecedent to greater succe ss overall.
