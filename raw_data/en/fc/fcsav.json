Yes homeopathic remedies can be safely taken by children, infants, pregnant mothers and animals. Home remedy kits are best kept out of reach of children as the white lactose pillules are very popular. What are homeopathic remedies made from? Homeopathic remedies are made from plants, minerals, animal or human tissues, disease products and many other sources. They are made by homeopaths and homeopathic dispensaries following a system of serial dilution to ensure they are safe for ingestion even by babies and during pregnancy. Even though the original source may be toxic, when given as a highly diluted homeopathic remedy they are safe to ingest. How do I take homeopathic remedies? Generally a homeopathic remedy is given as a pillule or tablet or in water. For babies the pillule can be crushed between two teaspoons and the powder given. Pillules can be handled by the person taking them but not by other people. The general dose for liquids is 2 drops. Shake well before taking liquid remedies. How robust are homeopathic remedies? Some people are concerned that coffee or peppermint may antidote their remedies. I have not found this to be case for most people but there are always those sensitive people who should avoid coffee and strong tasting or smelling substances, e.g. Vicks vapour rub. Store homeopathic remedies out of the sun, heat and away from electrical fields e.g., microwaves and mobile phones. Are homeopathic remedies safe to take with conventional drugs? Homeopathic remedies are safe because they highly diluted beyond Avogardo's number and become an energetic substance, unlike orthodox medicine which works in the chemistry of the body. Homeopathic remedies convey information into the body through the structure of water and this stimulates recovery. Some people have found that they need less of their conventional medicines when taking homeopathic remedies. Regular monitoring by your homeopath and your doctor is recommended when you are taking both homeopathic remedies and conventional medicines.. Can vaccination damage be resolved with homeopathic remedies? Children whose immune response is compromised following vaccinations may benefit from homeopathy. The use of homeopathic remedies made from vaccines is a form of isopathy and has been extensively used to help children regain their health. Angela uses [Intentional Grace](https://www.intentionalgrace.co.nz/) and the [CEASE protocols](http://www.cease-therapy.com) to support children return to excellent health while not interfering with the antibodies that develop in response to vaccines. Is there a safe alternative to vaccinations? Dr Isaac Golden, a homeopath from Australia, has completed his doctorate on the efficacy and safety of using homeopathic remedies made from diseased tissues as a method of epidemic disease prevention. This method called 'homeoprophylaxis' was developed by homeopathic doctors in the 1800-1900s. Public health doctors in Brazil gave the homeopathic remedy Meningococcal 30C to over 60,000 children, successfully preventing an epidemic of meningitis in two large towns. The homeopathic remedy made from Leptospirosis 30C was given to over 2 million people in a Cuban study which effectively stopped a leptospirosis epidemic within 2 weeks. Most viruses and bacterias are available as homeopathic remedies and homeopaths may use these in the current Covid-19 pandemic along with the remedies that individual clients may require based on their symptoms.
