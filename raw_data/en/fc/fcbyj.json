Our mission is not to compete but to fill a need that has not been met or to meet a need that has not yet been recognized. Our objective in producing and marketing products is to make life easier for our customers and help lessen stress in their lives. Our view of health is that all departures from wellness have stress at their root. Our approach is proactive on a product-specific basis but is also more broadly focused through our Calm Earth Project which began in 2007 and through Natural Vitality Publishing which produces educational and lifestyle eBooks and our web-based award-winning Calmful Living magazine which is aimed at inspiring calm, creative & conscious living. Natural Vitality Core Values A commitment to calmfulness. We would define calmfulness as a non-stressed and positive approach to life and living. This includes clarity, focus and personal energy management so that one brings ones \"A\" game to the party in working and living with others. We express this value in our Calmful Living magazine and ebooks from Natural Vitality Publishing. A commitment to equality. We don't believe that certain people are entitled over others. We don't see the world as a hierarchy but rather as a combination of viewpoints that are individually valid from individual points of view. We believe Earth's best future lies in unified diversity where our differences are respected, understood and positively utilized in order to gain a broader perspective. A commitment to holistic sustainability.In life there are many natural systems of which we are a part. These systems (our bodies, our planet and indeed the universe) are vast and complex and beyond the full understanding of our current science. From that view, we believe humility is an appropriate attitude and attempts to control natural systems should be made primarily to assist and augment in an effort to restore natural balance and functioning and not blindly undertaken for short-term economic gain. We express this value through our Calm Earth Project which has since 2007 supported organizations involved in organic and sustainable agriculture and soil restoration. Company Background Natural Vitality was founded in 1982 by Peter Gillham, developer of Natural Calm. In 2008, the company was sold to partners Ken and Susan Whitman and Justin Farmer. Today, Natural Vitality is an international purpose-driven company committed to healthier and happier living. Acquired by Wellnext Health in 2016, Natural Vitality has developed a line of best-selling supplements based on research and formulated to produce a noticeable result. Natural Vitality believes that real, lasting health requires the creation of a sustainable environment and locally-based food system. For our dietary supplements, we seek out organic plant-based ingredients wherever possible. All the fruits and vegetables we use are organically grown. The stevia and fruit flavorings are organic as well. This not only assures customers of no pesticide residues and no GMO ingredients but also provides financial support to organic farming.
