Randomised controlled trials (\u00153weeks follow-up) were identified from through training andneurofeedback) and complementary andalternative medicine (dietary therapy, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, herbal therapy, homeopathy, andphysical activity). The primary outcomes were efficacy (treat- ment response) andacceptability (all-cause discontinuation). Secondary outcomes were conducted estimates asodds with 95% credibility intervals. Weanalysed inter- ventions byclass and individually. 190 randomised trials (52different interventions grouped in32therapeutic classes) that enrolled 26114 participants with ADHD were included incomplex networks. Attheclass level, clonidine seemed significantly more efficacious than placebo. Methylphenidate and amphetamine seemed more efficacious than atomoxetine and guanfacine .Methylpheni- date and clonidine seemed better accepted than placebo and atomoxetine. Most ofthe efficacious pharmacolog icaltreatments were associated with harms (anorexia, weight loss and insomnia), butanincreased riskofserious adverse events and other complementar yand alternative medicine. Overall findings were limited bytheclinical and evidence; consequently, results should beinterpreted with caution. Conclusions Clinical differences may exist between thepharmacologic alandnon-pharmac ological treat- ment used forthemanagement ofADHD. Uncertainties andthebalance between benefits, costs andpotential harms should beconsidered before starting treatment. There isanurgent diagnosed psy- chiatric disorders inchildren and adolescents. Recent estimates suggest that ADHD affects about 3\u00b17% ofyoung people worldwide [1\u00b12], inattention and/ orhyperactivity/impu lsivity, with difficulties often continuing into adulthood.

Although theevidence isnotstrong, pharmacological treatment using stimulant medication isgenerally recommended forschool-age children and adolescents with ADHD, along with implementation ofpsychological interventions based on behavioural approaches [9\u00b111].

Knowledge gaps inthecurrent evidence base present opportunities fortheapplication of novel evidence synthesis methods tocomplex networks oftrials and interventions, aswell as rigorous comparative evaluations ofmultiple treatments forADHD. Relatively new methods have been developed toanalyse such complex trial data, including network meta-analysis, which helps tointegrate and synthesise diverse Network meta-analysis hasbeen generation tool evidence synthesis when setoftreatments and trials isincluded inthesame weaimed tocompare theefficacy and safety ofpharmacological, psychological and complementary and alternative medicine interventions forthetreatment ofADHD in children and adolescents. Weused network meta-analyses comparing multiple interventions tointegrate direct and indirect evidence into unified networks ofallavailable randomised trials. Methods This systematic review wasconducted and reported inaccordance with thereporting guidance provided inthePRISMA network meta-analysis [29] [30]. Our methods arebriefly described here (and explained inS1Text and inthepublished [30]).

We included trials that enrolled patients with comorbid conditions (such asoppositional defiant, conduct disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy orother ADHD associated medical condi- tions). Eligible interventions were pharmacological, psychological, complementary and alter- native medicine, and combined interventions. Pharmacological interventions were not required tobelicensed forADHD. Control conditions were placebo ornotreatment, waitlist (inpsychological studies), and usual care orcontrol (however defined inthetrials) (see Box 1 Box 1.Brief description ofinterventions being evaluated Pharmacological interventions.

The pre-specified primary outcomes were treatment response and all-cause treatment dis- continuation rates, chosen because they areamong themost clinically meaningful and consis- tently reported estimates oftreatment acceptability inmental health [30,31]. Wedefined score onthe ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). When trials reported results from multiple rating scales, we used CGI results asthepreferred scale. Clinicians, teachers orparents, and patients rated symptoms and global functioning. Asperourreview protocol [30], clinician rated measures were given preference all-cause discontinuation forany measured atthelongest available follow-up.

The Cochrane Risk ofBias tool [36] that considers sequence generation, allocation con- cealment, and masking and other aspects ofbias, wasused toassess bytwooffour reviewers. Weused the Grading [33,39]. Any discrepancies between reviewers for anyoftheabove steps were discussed until consensus wasachieved. Geometry oftheevidence networks assessed Weanalysed interventions byclass (e.g., behavioural therapy, stimulants, non-stimulants, etc.) and individually (e.g., training, methylphenidate, etc.). treatments with simi- larmechanisms ofaction were classified inwhich treatment effects were considered tobesimilar. Our primary class-level analyses classified therapeutic class interventions used in monotherapy and/or combination asseparate treatment nodes irrespective oftheir doses: con- trols (placebo, usual care/control andwaiting list), psychological (behavioural therapy such asparent training, child training andteacher training; cognitive training including results Network treatment Aversus treatment Bviaacommon comparator C)and consistency (equivalency of treatment effects from direct and indirect evidence) [29,44].

Inmany Western countries, theprescribing rates have increased dramatically, with wide variations inmedical practice [53\u00b156] that have ledtoremarkable controversies and public debate around theclinical (and social) management ofADHD [57\u00b160].

Most oftheefficacious pharmacological treatments (particularly, stimulants) were associated with anorexia, weight loss andinsomnia. One ofthemost important clinical implications isthat behavioural therapy, particularly given byparents and with active child and teacher involvement, istheonly non-pharmacologi- calintervention that wasfound tobeassociated with statistically significant benefits inour analyses.

Other unlicensed medications have gained popularity inthemental health treatment ofyoung people indicated inADHD) iscurrently very limited. Similarly, concerns have been raised about thebenefit-risk profile oftheuseinADHD ofthese agents outside of approved indications [40,61\u00b164]. Our systematic review suggests that treatment effects arelarger when behavioural therapy is combined with stimulants (with very lowquality ofevidence). The clinical decision tocombine these interventions should bedriven presented, theneeds ofthechildren and their family and because Combining behavioural therapy with stimulants may enhance atten- tional processes and reduce impulsive responding, and may beaway ofreducing thedosage and duration ofpharmacological treatment, and thus addressing concerns about thepotential harms associated with theuseofpharmacotherapy [9,65].

Our finding that combination ofstim- about adoption ofthistherapeutic strategy could bejustified despite thepotential benefits ofcombi- nation drug regimens, because available information onthebalance between potential benefits and safety areincompletely characterized inthebiomedical literature [72\u00b177]. There aremultiple and diverse clinical guidelines forthemanagement ofADHD [9\u00b111,40,78\u00b180], such asthose developed bytheNational Institute forHealth and Care Excellence (NICE) [9]and bytheScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) in theUK[78], and ofPediatrics (AAP) [79] treatment should forthose ADHD children with severe symptoms and impairment, ormoderate levels ofimpairment who have refused non-pharma- cological interventions, orwhose symptoms have notresponded sufficiently tobehavioural interventions. approach following UKrecommendations, which suggests that increased access tobehavioural therapy and pharmacological treatment (asindicated) would improve symptomatic and functional outcomes forchildren and adolescents with ADHD. Along with broad recognition that data from some clinical trials and treatment compari- sons were sparse, and that more and higher-quality data could improve estimations and rec- ommendations, aspects ofthegeneral approach ofprevious [12\u00b117,81\u00b183] were challenged. Forexample, tworecent Cochrane systematic [12] and methylphenidate allow multiple intervention tobemade. The strengths ofthis review also include thecompleteness ofthesearch including multiple databases and trial regis- tries, forward searching ofunpublished data and hand searching ofthegrey literature, riskof bias assessment and reporting ofconfidence intreatment effects when interpreting each ther- apycomparison. Wealso protocol missed studies duetodifferences intheeligibility criteria and coverage oftheretrieved reviews. Similar toother clinical beused when interpreting findings, considering thefactthat notalltreatments (particularly, non-pharmacological treatments) arerepresented inthetrials that formed theevidence base. The primary outcomes ofefficacy and acceptability were themost commonly and consistently reported Aswith individual clinical trials and pairwise meta-analyses, secondary outcomes and additional analyses (e.g., sensitivity analyses and subgroups analyses) should beregarded asexploratory and multiple testing [84,85] issues need tobeconsidered when results areinterpreted. Our review does notprovide evidence that supports anystimulant over another, and does notreveal anysignificant differ- ences between short-acting and long-acting formulations. Insufficient patient numbers and events toform well connected networks limited theanalyses that could beconducted to account fordosage and intensity ofnon-stimulants non-pharmacological Although definitions, reporting ofevents in studies posed amajor challenge.

The overall quality ofthenetwork meta-analyses evidence ranged from lowtovery lowasassessed bytheGRADE approach (the concerns ofrisk ofbias intherandomised trials, imprecision oftreat- ment and S7Table). onthepri- mary theinterpretation ofourfindings. Atthestudy level, many trials appear tohave several reporting ormethodological issues, and anadditional limitation wasthevery small bias and conflicts ofinterest [13,86] could theriskofbias even more appar- entthan that reported inourreview. Inouropinion, these issues require further pragmatic action atthelevels ofplanning, funding, conduct, and reporting ofrandomised trials [85,87\u00b1 90]. Preexisting therapies, thesettings inwhich psychological interventions were undertaken, how they were carried out, and potential factors responsible forresponse orfailure arenot always clearly classifica- ofindividual patient data, long-term (chronic) andtreatment decisions. Weselected forour primary efficacy outcome ofresponse ratetouseadichotomous rather than continuous measure (e.g. standardized mean difference), because from aclinical perspective, syntheses ofcontinuous Dichotomisation may also increase theriskofapositive result being a false positive [91\u00b193]. Furthermore, wewere unable andsuicidal ourresults might have limited generalizability (social, economic, educational andcultural context), because studies were mostly conducted inchildren andadolescents from Western countries. Consequently, ourresults should beinterpreted given thecave- atsmentioned forimprovement inthedesign, conduct and inthe field. The clinical research agenda ofADHD isincomplete and needs better designed and reported randomised trials and Apertinent research agenda [100,101] which views ADHD dimensionally, but also integrating mental health services and interventions into priority care strategies, should beestablished inorder toappreciate which treatments arebest forADHD children There isanurgent need forlong-term randomised trials at low-risk ofbias and with sufficient numbers ofparticipants. Itisimportant that future clinical trials report completely themethods and results foralloutcomes ofinterest (including adverse events) using standardised outcome measures atsimilar time points toensure include infuture evidence should berigorously adopted and implemented forstudy study reports, respectively. Inconclusion, although thequality ofevidence isnotstrong, clinical differences may exist between and non-pharmacological treatments commonly used forthe management ofADHD. Behavioural therapy and pharmacological treatment may improve the symptoms ofADHD and global functioning intheshort-term. Our findings canhelp clini- cians, healthcare providers, parents, and caregivers make informed decisions regarding treat- ment selection forthemanagement ofADHD. Anopen and honest discussion with parents and older children about uncertainties ofavailable treatments and thebalance between bene- fits,costs, and potential harms should beestablished before treatment. Inaddition, there isanurgent need forhigh-quality randomised trials ofthemultiple treatments and paper. Conceptualization: e72[Internet].
