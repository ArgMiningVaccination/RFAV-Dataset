FY 2023 enacted includes $116.171 million for Overseas Operations Costs, $14.1 million for Ukraine Supplemental, $5.0 million for Fisher House, $168 million for transfer to VA for Lovell FHCC, and $15 million for transfer to Joint Incentive Fund. 3. FY 2024 request includes $230.885 million for Overseas Operations Costs, $172.0 million for transfer to VA for Lovell FHCC and $15 million for transfer to the DoD-VA Joint Incentive Fund. 4. Reflects DoD Medicare-Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) O&M transfer Receipts for FY 2022, FY 2023 and FY 2024 that support 2.5 million Medicare-eligible retirees and their family members. Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Introductory Statement PBA-19 Exhibit DHP 2Description of Operations Financed: The Defense Health Program (DHP) Operation and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation funding provides for worldwide medical and dental services to active forces and other eligible beneficiaries, occupational and industrial health care, and specialized services for the training of medical personnel. The MHS provides care in government owned and operated medical treatment facilities focused on sustaining readiness of the medical force and the medical readiness of deployable forces. Additionally, the MHS purchases more than 65 percent of the total care provided for beneficiaries through tailored contracts, such as Managed Care Support Contracts responsible for the administration of the TRICARE benefit. The DoD Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) is an accrual fund to pay for DoD's share of applicable Direct Care and Private Sector Care operation and maintenance health care costs for Medicare-eligible retirees, retiree family members and survivors. In FY 2024, we are anticipating COVID costs to continue to come down, driving a reduction in the DHP budget in Direct Care and Private Sector Care for costs attributed directly to COVID. The Department continues to invest in testing, Bio-surveillance, genomic sequencing, and integrating health information technology systems to protect against and treat COVID-19 and prepare for new variants, while applying lessons learned to prepare for future biological threats and other major public health emergencies. The National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs) for FY 2017, FY 2019, and FY 2020 contained language to drive a wide range of structural and management reforms within the MHS. These adjustments have been catalysts for the transformation of the MHS into a more integrated system of readiness and health. As we develop new ways of doing business, our commitment is to build an improved system of military health. This system will continuously improve, ensuring success in supporting service members that are fit to fight; medical professionals are ready to support them in training and on the battlefield; and our great outcomes for all those who serve. The MHS is laser-focused on three key areas of organizational reform; integrated management of care provided in the direct care and purchased care systems, a reinvigorated approach to readiness within the direct care system, and optimizing the recruitment, education, training, and sustainment of talented and committed service members with size, quality, and composition to deliver care, anywhere, anytime in support of our service members. The FY 2024 budget continues the MHS reform efforts underway by focusing on improving access to services for our patients by better integrating the direct and purchased care systems. Standardization will lead to improved safety and the availability of options for patients to manage their health care more easily. As of FY2022, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) has completed the transition of all Military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) to DHA in accordance with the Department's approved conditions-based execution plan (Plan 3 version 6) for critical milestones. In response to Section 741 of the NDAA for FY 2023, the FY 2024 President's Budget suspends planned clinical medical military end strength divestitures. The Department will use this directed pause to conduct an assessment of current military medical end strength to match operational requirements and enable the MHS to increase the medical readiness of the force, as well as the readiness of our medical force. Following this assessment, the Department will submit a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees that certifies the completion of a comprehensive review of the military medical manning and justification for any proposed changes to the composition of the military medical end strength and the plan to address civilian backfill and persistent civilian vacancies or risks associated with the planned reductions. Private Sector Care continues to be a vital part of the Military Health System in FY 2024 and represents over half of the Operations and Maintenance requirement. Over the period of FY 2012 to FY 2018, both private health insurance premiums and National Health Expenditures per capita rose 25% (or 3.7% annually). The Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Introductory Statement PBA-19 Exhibit DHP 3Private Sector Care budget should have continued to rise but the Department, with concurrence from Congress, instituted a series of initiatives that bent the cost curve. A combination of benefit changes, payment savings initiatives, contract changes, and population reductions offset underlying increases in health care costs, which is estimated to have saved $3.5 billion over a six-year period. Beginning toward the end of FY 2019 and continuing into FY 2020, the Department began to experience significant growth without the benefit of new reforms to offset the increases. In FY 2022, the Department focused on re-baselined funding for Private Sector Care healthcare requirements using the latest execution data, National Health Expenditure rates, beneficiary population forecasts, and current policy/compensation assumptions. Based on FY 2021 execution and FY 2022 execution, the much higher PSC baseline update was valid. In FY 2024, the Department is making additional investments in Private Sector Care based on the previous year's execution trends and the FY 2024 request fully funds the Department's anticipated PSC requirements to reduce risk to other DoD programs. Private Sector Care will continue to represent an important part of the overall health system in FY 2024 and beyond. Mental Health continues to be an area of emphasis across the DoD. The FY 2024 budget invests $1.4 billion in clinical mental health programs and initiatives include those which evaluate, treat, and follow-up with patients with a variety of mental health issues. These programs leverage evidence-based best practices and treatment, practical problem resolution, case management and crisis management to support positive health outcomes. Ongoing mental health efforts within the Department include Primary Care Behavioral Health, Tele-Behavioral Health, National Intrepid Center of Excellence and Intrepid Spirit Centers, Substance Abuse Program, as well as research on mental health aimed to accelerate the innovation and delivery of preventive interventions and treatments for TBI, PTSD, and other mental health conditions. The DoD and the Department of Veteran's Affairs continue to progress in the establishment of the unified Electronic Health Record. In FY 2024, the DoD continues funding the clinical application, HealtheIntent, which provides a platform for population health and analytic tools and offers a seamless longitudinal record between the DoD and VA that will grant providers and beneficiaries' access to detailed medical histories. The FY 2024 budget supports the completion of MHS GENESIS deployment Outside the Continental United States with the following waves slated to go live within FY 2024: Waves LANDSTUHL, LAKENHEATH, OKINAWA, AND GUAM/SOUTH KOREA. This is all part of the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization Program (DHMSM) Program Management Office's (PMO) deployment schedule and incorporates lessons learned from prior deployments completed to date. In addition, the FY 2024 budget supports MHS GENESIS moving to full sustainment of all sites post deployment as well as critical enhancements to the original MHS GENESIS capabilities. These enhancements include tele-health initiatives, interfaces between MHS GENESIS and the Patient Queuing & Notification System (PQNS) and the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS), and product improvement engineering to support agile development, configuration, and test of new capabilities for MHS GENESIS. In addition, the FY24 budget supports MHS strategic goals and facilitates informed decision-making through the delivery of vital information services and data in a timely, relevant, and actionable manner via Enterprise Intelligence & Data Solutions (EIDS). EIDS has become the nexus of all Military Health System (MHS) secondary data and the core data broker and provider for most clinical and operational medical systems across the enterprise. The EIDS PMO strives to execute the DHA Data Vision of providing seamless data services and decision support for clinicians, patients, beneficiaries, analysts, researchers, and DoD leadership to improve patient care through the MIP. EIDS Military Health System Information Platform (MIP) enclave integrates over 130 data sources, 50+ clinical registries and rationalized over 22 data warehouses, 18 applications over the last 4 years. In addition, it supports a set of DoD legacy systems and projects that aim to increase data interoperability and access to electronic health data via digital health hub serving up health care data to DoD and Federal partners. The MIP provides a core Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Introductory Statement PBA-19 Exhibit DHP 4clinical research platform for self-service business intelligence and is building an artificial intelligence and machine learning workbench. Additionally, EIDS is building the first secure cloud-based genomics platform for the DoD. An inability to fully fund the EIDS initiative would result in an enterprise loss of value in bringing together data, information technology, and data science, delivering analytics-driven insights for customers driving towards prescriptive analytics, as well as delay the ability of the Departments to meet the Congressional intent of a fully interoperable health record. The DHP appropriation funds the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) program developed in response to the needs of the National Defense Strategy and Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS). The goal is to advance the state of medical science in those areas of most pressing need and relevance to today's battlefield experience and emerging threats. The objectives are to discover and explore innovative approaches to protect, support, and advance the health and welfare of military personnel and individuals eligible for care in the MHS; to accelerate the transition of medical technologies into deployed products; and to accelerate the translation of advances in knowledge into new standards of care for injury prevention, treatment of casualties, rehabilitation, and training systems that can be applied in theater or in military medical treatment facilities. The DHP Procurement program funds acquisition of capital equipment in MTFs and other selected health care activities which include equipment for initial outfitting of newly constructed, expanded, or modernized health care facilities; equipment for modernization and replacement of uneconomically reparable items; and MHS information technology (IT) requirements. O&M Changes Narrative Explanation of FY 2023 and FY 2024 Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Changes: The DHP O&M funding reflects an overall increase of $1,491.2 million between FY 2023 and FY 2024, consisting of $1,406.0 million in price growth and a net program increase of $85.2 million. $230.9 million of Overseas Operations Costs is included in the base request. Program increases include: $402.8 million increase is based on beneficiary population forecasts, policy changes and significantly increasing healthcare costs. The increase is fueled by higher Medicare reimbursement rates set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which statutorily determine the TRICARE reimbursement rates for PSC providers and facilities. $78.2 million to address the estimated impacts of Executive Order 14026, Increasing the Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors, dated April 27, 2021 (BAG 1 $46.2M, BAG 3 $30.6M, BAG 6 $1.4M). $73.4 million provides funds for Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems requirements, the increase is largely due to the realignment of funding from RDT&E to O&M to reflect the new Acquisition Strategy approved January 2021, including: 1) continued funding of software development that will occur beyond the first MVCR; 2) funding of IT Management and testing support for software development beyond the first MVCR.

Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Introductory Statement PBA-19 Exhibit DHP 8Procurement Changes Narrative Explanation of FY 2023 and FY 2024 Procurement Changes: The DHP Procurement Program has a net decrease $188.2 million between FY 2023 and FY 2024. This includes price growth of $16.3 million and a net program decrease of $204.5 million. Program increases include: $28.0 million increase to Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems (JOMIS) program per rephasing of activities to align with the program's new Acquisition Strategy and Capability Roadmap signed by Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) Jan 2021. Funding will be used for initial system implementation and fielding of JOMIS programs, to include new equipment training (NET) as well as procurement of hardware and software which is required to build out the infrastructure of JOMIS's hosting requirement. Deployment activities include purchasing required commercial software user license and site visits, localized configuration, on-site deployment support to include \"over-the shoulder\" support to approximately 450+ forward and resuscitative sites, 300+ ships, 2 hospital ships, 6 theater hospitals, and 3 aeromedical staging units deployed across all geographic combatant commands environments while providing access to authoritative sources of clinical data. Program decreases include: $227.5 million decrease in Department of Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) due to the planned completion of MHS GENESIS wave deployments in the first half of FY 2024. $5.0 million decrease for the replacement of medical equipment across the Military Health System for Medical/Surgical, Preventive Medicine/Pharmacy, and Radiographic programs. President's Management Plan - Performance Metrics Requirements: The Military Health System (MHS) continues to refine existing performance measures and develop specific criteria to determine and measure outputs/outcomes as compared with initial goals. The Quadruple Aim provides a focused and balanced approach to overall performance. This approach includes outcome measures related to medical readiness, a healthy population, positive patient experiences and the responsible management of health care costs. Individual Medical Readiness - This measure provides operational commanders, Military Department leaders and primary care managers use a measure to monitor the medical readiness status of their personnel, ensuring a healthy and fit fighting force medically ready to deploy. This represents the best-available indicator of the medical readiness of the Total Force (Active Component and Reserve Component) prior to deployment. Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Introductory Statement PBA-19 Exhibit DHP 9Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction is measured using a standard survey instrument comparable to those used by civilian plans. The goal is to improve MHS beneficiary overall satisfaction with TRICARE to a level at or above benchmark satisfaction with civilian plans utilizing the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. Increasing satisfaction with the Health Plan indicates that actions being taken are improving the overall functioning of the health plan from the beneficiary perspective. The MHS is modernizing and improving all its surveys to better assess beneficiary satisfaction. The MHS plans to resolve current known survey challenges by normalizing by demographics and volume to make the data more meaningful, improve result accuracy and performance assessment. The MHS also plans to improve the response rate, which is very low; low survey response rates overrepresents negative bias, per survey science and peer-reviewed literature. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - This measure focuses on the annual overall cost growth for the Prime enrollees and includes all costs related to health care delivered to enrollees. The objective is to keep the rate of cost growth for TRICARE Prime enrollees to a level at or below the increases for the Civilian health care plans at the national level. Currently, the measure provides insight to issues regarding unit cost, utilization management, and purchased care management. The metric has been enhanced to properly account for differences in population demographics and health care requirements of the enrolled population. Since enrollment demographics can vary significantly by enrollment site, and across time, it is important to adjust the measure. For example, as increasing numbers of older individuals enroll, the overall average medical expense per enrollee would likely increase. Conversely, as younger, healthy active-duty family members enroll, the overall average would likely decrease. Using adjustment factors, a comparison across enrolment locations and across time is made more meaningful. Below is reporting for FY 2022 performance measures related to the Quadruple Aim. Performance in general represents a return to more normal health care operations by the end of the fiscal year, following MHS supporting the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as part of the whole-of- government response in confronting COVID-19. While most treatment operations have returned to a normal level, the impacts related to COVID-19 remain a significant health risk that likely will impact health care operations as more is understood regarding the long-term impacts of the virus. The overall success of each measure is discussed below: Individual Medical Readiness - The MHS achieved 91 percent for the Total Force Medical Readiness in the last quarter of FY 2022 versus the goal of 90 percent. The FY 2022 adjusted target is based on updated guidance signed out in July 2022, with respect to enhancing the performance levels and clarified reporting of individuals. In the past, individuals who were reported under Medically Ready Indeterminate and those currently deployed impacted the measure in a manner that would artificially lower the score because of administrative items easily resolved once members returned from deployments. The fourth quarter of FY 2022 was the first reporting period that exceeded the revised goal established in July of 2022. The key drivers for improved performance include: (1) reduced delinquent PHAs, (2) reduced Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions, (3) reduced percentage of delinquent dental exams (Dental Class 4), and reduced percentage of non-deployable dental conditions (Dental Class 3). Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction with Health Care Plan performance for FY2022 matched or exceeding the benchmark for all quarters based on Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey for the fiscal year. Overall, there was a slight decrease in the satisfaction level related to the continued access issues related to COVID-19. It appears that the continued access restrictions at the MTFs related to force health protections related to COVID-19 drove part of the decrease along with deployments in support of FEMA and whole-of-government response in confronting COVID-19. With the dramatic reduction of COVID-19 related health care utilization, the MHS has efforts in place to improve access to the Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Introductory Statement PBA-19 Exhibit DHP 10MTFs which should improve the overall trend and maintain levels above the benchmark for future fiscal years. Major performance drivers for this measure are related to claims processing timeliness, interaction during health care encounter, and access to health care. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The performance estimate for the first 11 months of FY 2022 is a 1.9 percent growth vs goal of 4.1 percent growth. This represents a return to normal performance for the system and is primary attributable to the impacts of COVID-19 on the United States health care system during the pandemic. Overall, the entire health care system experienced a dramatic increase in utilization of health care services during FY 2021 as delayed care from COVID-19 returned. The return of normal growth in FY 2022 represents what is expected to be continued health care utilization for TRICARE Prime enrollees that should remain for the next couple of years. Note: Due to the deployment of MHS GENESIS and data availability issues, sites that have deployed the new Electronic Health Record are excluded from the Per Member Per Month measure. The 11-month timeframe is being utilized because of the deployment of MHS GENESIS to additional treatment facilities, and related data issues that are in the process of being resolved that link direct care costs and workload for multiple years to ensure that trend information is available.Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Funding by Budget Activity O-1 Exhibit DHP 11 (Dollars in Thousands) 0130D Defense Health Program ActualFY 20232/ EnactedFY Base + BUDGET ACTIVITY 01: OPERATION & MAINTENANCE 0130D 010 In-House Care ($137,000K), Fisher House ($5,000K) and JIF ($15,000K) 2.

A trend in increasing RVU per encounter estimates are contributing to disproportionate decreases in encounters to workload. 4. The FY 2022 to FY 2023 and FY 2023 to FY 2024 decreased pharmacy prescriptions (30-Day equivalents) is due to more patients being seen in the Private Sector Care and filling prescriptions in Mail Order and Retail following patient preference and behavior induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. 5. There are data quality improvements with increasing knowledge of MHS GENESIS systems. Workload and encounter estimates reflect these data quality improvements. As data continues to mature, estimates can change. Exclusions: 1. The TRICARE for Life (TFL) eligible beneficiary encounters are an estimate. FY 2022 ambulatory encounters observe that 10 - 11 percent of the encounters are eligible TFL beneficiaries. Estimates include a 10% reduction in encounters for the TFL population. 2.

Private Sector Care Medical Contracts Baseline Requirement:..........................................................................................$402,773 The Private Sector Care (PSC) adjustment is based on beneficiary population forecasts, policy changes, and increasing healthcare costs, fueled by higher Medicare reimbursement rates set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which statutorily determine the TRICARE reimbursement rates for PSC providers and facilities. According to CMS, inpatient hospital rates updated on August 1, 2022, reflect the highest market basket update in the last 25 years. The Medicare rate increase exacerbates the demands on the PSC budget to absorb the COVID-19 costs and workload, DoD medical efficiency efforts to streamline the Medical Treatment Facility care, costs associated with the new PSC T-5 contract including the FY 2024 transition cost, and the likely reduction in the level of provider discounts, and benefit policy decisions directing a TRICARE reproductive benefit expansion and reduced beneficiary out-of-pocket costs. The FY 2023 Private Sector Care baseline budget request is $18,577,877K. 2) b. Active Duty Utilization of Private Sector Care (Non-Mental Health):.....................................................................................$54,540 Funds increased utilization due to the continued shift of Active Duty (AD) care from Direct Care military treatment facilities to Private Sector Care network. From FY 2018 to FY 2022, the DHP has observed PSC obligations for care for AD members increase an average of 10% annually. The FY 2023 Private Sector Care baseline budget request is $18,577,877K. 3) c. Private Sector Care Pharmacy Baseline Requirement:.........................................................................................................$46,630 Retail Pharmacy costs continue to grow significantly, with increases of 13%, 9%, and 11% in FY 2020 - FY 2022. Additionally, FY 2023 Retail costs through January are 23% higher compared to FY 2022. Funds increased Retail and Mail Order Scripts attributed to more patients seen in the Private Sector Care and filling prescriptions in Mail Order and Retail, following patient preference and behavior induced by COVID. In addition, with the rollout of MHS GENESIS, patients seen at the MTF can request their prescriptions be sent to the pharmacy of their choice. The FY 2023 Private Sector Care baseline budget request is $18,577,877K. 4) d. Active Duty Mental Health: ....................................................................................................................................................$46,460 Funds increased utilization of Private Sector Care (PSC) mental health treatment by Active Duty (AD). From FY 2018 to FY 2022, the DHP has observed that PSC non-institutional costs for AD members with mental health diagnoses increased by 29.8% annually. During the same period, PSC institutional costs for AD members with a mental health or alcohol/drug use diagnosis increased an average of 14.5% annually. The FY 2023 Private Sector Care baseline budget request is $18,577,877K. 5) e.

The FY 2023 estimates were updated after the President's Budget enactment. These figures are based on current data and trends analysis used in the forecasts for the FY 2024 estimates. 2. The FY 2023 and FY 2024 estimates use a centrally weighted moving average at the Parent Military Treatment Facility and Healthcare Product/Service Line Level. 3. A trend in increasing RVU per encounter estimates are contributing to disproportionate decreases in encounters to workload. 4. The FY 2022 to FY 2023 and FY 2023 to FY 2024 decreased pharmacy prescriptions (30-Day equivalents) is due to more patients being seen in the Private Sector Care and filling prescriptions in Mail Order and Retail following patient preference and behavior induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. 5. There are data quality improvements with increasing knowledge of MHS GENESIS systems. Workload and encounter estimates reflect these data quality improvements. As data continues to mature, estimates can change. Exclusions: 1. The TRICARE for Life (TFL) eligible beneficiary encounters are an estimate. FY 2022 ambulatory encounters observe that 10 - 11 percent of the encounters are eligible TFL beneficiaries. Estimates include a 10% reduction in encounters for the TFL population. 2.

The FY 2023 estimates are derived from the review of a weighted moving average, calculated at the Parent Facility, with the workload for non-Active Duty held steady. 3. The FY 2024 estimates are based on the smoothed weighted moving average of FY 2023 estimates, with the workload for non-Active Duty held steady. 4. The average Dental Weighted Value per encounter continues to trend up, particularly for Active Duty beneficiaries, increasing from 2.8 to 3.5, attributed to a post-COVID-19 recovery, with multiple procedures performed during dental visits.

Birthing Center Iwakuni is a child DMIS to Naval Hospital Yokosuka and was previously counted as an \"Inpatient Facility.\" This is now recognized as a clinic. 2. Medical Clinics: There is no increase in actual building structures. The projected increase in Medical Clinics is administrative in nature to ensure system alignment with MHS GENESIS Patient Care locations. The policy reinforcement has come from two different directions: 1) Defense Medical Information System Identifiers (DMIS IDs) table alignment with MHS GENESIS to resolve issues in clerk/patient appointing and 2) aligning overhead costs to a building or function to better reflect the cost of care (delineating buildings on the DMIS table that don't fall under a campus concept). In addition, Naval Hospital Bremerton converted to a Medical Clinic from an Inpatient Facility and Birthing Center Iwakuni is recorded as a medical clinic. 3. Changes from previous facility count methodology is based on standardization for accounting of the Inpatient Facilities, Medical Clinics and Dental Clinics DMIS IDs under the Defense Health Agency and to reduce DMIS ID duplication.

The driving factors are rapid technological advancements in these areas and the need for DoD's health care delivery system to maintain the standards of care set by the civilian health care sector. Procurement investments for information systems will cover software license acquisitions, and hardware replacement supporting the Department of Defense's Military Health System (MHS) Information Technology. Financing an adequate equipment acquisition budget is critical in retaining the Department's medical workload in-house and controlling escalating purchased healthcare O&M costs in the private sector. The items supported by this budget are the result of an extensive investment equipment justification process and are necessary to provide properly trained medical department personnel and high quality, cost effective health care services for the eligible beneficiary population.Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Estimates Procurement Budget Item Justification P-40 Exhibit DHP 152BUDGET ITEM JUSTIFICATION SHEET APPROPRIATION / BUDGET ACTIVITY : P-1 ITEM Enacted Request Estimate Estimate Estimate Estimate Quantity Total Cost ($ M) 20.926 outfitting program element of the DHP's procurement budget funds the acquisition and installation of commercially available equipment to furnish new and expanded facilities being completed under military construction projects in support of dental services, health care delivery, health care training, and other health care activities.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences/Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (USUHS/AFRRI), is a unique Department of Defense asset, responsible for preserving and protecting the health and performance of U.S. military personnel operating in potential radiologically contaminated multi-domain conventional or hybrid battle spaces and urban environments; through research, education, and operational training that advance understanding of the effects of ionizing radiation in line with the 21st century dynamic threat landscape and national security threats posed by non-state actors, hostile state actors, and near-peer adversaries, as well as providing rapidly deployable radiation medicine expertise in response to a radiological or nuclear event domestically or abroad. The uniqueness of USUHS/AFRRI comes from operating and maintaining state-of-the-art radiation facilities and dosimetry systems to support military relevant radiobiology research. These facilities enable researchers to conduct a wide range of radiobiology experiments in order to investigate militarily-relevant scenarios, and better understand radiation effects and potential mitigation strategies. A team of scientist, physicists, engineers, operators and technicians use proven and traceable dosimetry systems (e.g., ionization chambers, radiochromic film, thermoluminescent dosimeters) and consensus protocols to characterize radiation fields. Due to these facilities our researchers are able to experiment with photons (gamma-rays) which are intended to simulate fallout environments and are delivered by two cobalt-60 facilities - the high-level cobalt facility (HLCF), and for lower (chronic) doses and dose rates, the low-level cobalt facility (LLCF). These type of radiation sources are used for acute and chronic studies of materials, biologic specimens, and small and large animals. The LLCF also provides to our scientist low-dose rate gamma rays to simulate chronic exposure to low absorbed doses. Therefore, it also supports research focused on late or delayed radiation effects in biological specimens. USUHS/AFRRI researchers are also able to use mixed-radiation fields (photons and neutrons) which are available from USUHS/AFRRI's Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomics (TRIGA) reactor. The reactor is operated in either steady-state or pulsed mode to simulate a wide range of prompt exposure scenarios on a nuclear battlefield. The USUHS/AFRRI's TRIGA is the only one dedicated to military radiobiology research. The reactor produces a controlled, self-sustaining fission chain reaction in the reactor core which, in addition to the fuel elements and control rods (containing boron carbide), which includes a neutron start-up source (americium/ beryllium). It is suspended under 4.9 m of water within a pool (an effective radiation shield) in a carriage assembly that allows movement of the core between two exposure rooms for experimental work with large-animal or other studies. The advantages of such a movable reactor core are that the quantity and character of the radiation that reaches the exposure facilities can be controlled, and more than one exposure facility can be used during reactor operations. Our state-of-the-art radiation facilities are also able to provide a wide range of photon and electron irradiations for partial- and whole-body geometries by using a linear accelerator (LINAC) and a small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) providing a range of radiation types, energies, field sizes and dose rates and is extensively Volume 1 - 43PE 0602787DHA: Medical Technology (AFRRI) Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 11 R-1 Line #3Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2024 Defense Health Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0602787DHA / Medical Technology (AFRRI) used to support standard cell configurations (i.e., 6-, 24- and 96-well plates), and targeted partial body irradiations of mice, minipigs, and nonhuman-primates (NHP) animal models. AFRRI's LINAC is used to produce, monitor, control and form photon or electron beams to the specified target. Whole-body irradiations are also possible depending on the animal size and desired dose rate. An Xstrahl SARRP facility is capable of operating at 220 kVp and 13 mA yielding a dose rate at the isocenter of approximately 2.6 Gy/min. Onboard portal camera and cone beam computed tomography (CT) imaging systems are used to ensure precise dose delivery. Lung- and gut-only irradiation protocols are approved and have been extensively used to support radiation countermeasure development in the mouse model. Other imaging support is provided by a Philips Brilliance CT big bore scanner. Some features of the scanner include an 85-cm bore size to accommodate larger research subjects, 60- cm true scan field of view and 16-slices per revolution. The above radiation sources and generators are used to support USUHS/AFRRI's current research focus areas which we will address in the following section. Our scientific research goals includes maintaining a pool of highly qualified radiation biologists, and basic and applied research in identification and early development of measures to prevent, assess, and treat radiation injury. USUHS/AFRRI scientists conduct and publish research critical to the Department of Defense for force health protection and also contribute to the health and well-being of the population at large. USUHS/AFRRI research thrusts include development of diagnosis of radiation induced injury (biodosimetry), internalized radionuclides (internal contamination) and radiation countermeasures. Research findings are mainly focused to advance the development and to produce the following: (1) To establish processes to permit rapid assessment of radiation exposed specimens using novel triage protocols; (2) To develop novel technologies to minimize the use of animal models in the study of radiation effects; (3) To investigate the overall radiation effect by internal contamination in the microbiome and anatomical tissue; (4) To find novel biomarkers, late effects and immunosuppression of radiation injury that can quantitate effects on combat performance decrements; (5) To identify novel therapeutic strategies that will support military operations within a nuclear or radiological environment minimizing ground troops short and long term adverse risk.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences/Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (USUHS/AFRRI), the Biodosimetry program addresses clinical symptoms of radiation exposure, reach back reference capabilities. Biodosimetry is the only method to detect, assess and estimate radiation dose exposure and is critical for military missions and saving lives. AFRRI prepared an in-depth Business Case Analysis and is strategically poised to establish the DoD's Advanced Biodosimetry Network (DABN), meeting the objective of US Senate Report SR 114-63. The established network would be complemented with the Diagnostic Biodosimetry Laboratory that aligns with the DoD Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program (CLIP). CLIP describes requirements within the respective DoD's Active and Reserve Components and facilities under their supervision to include oversight, inspections, proficiency testing (PT), personnel standards, and training in laboratories performing testing on human specimens so that clinical decisions can be made [reference DoDI 6440.02]\". The Biodosimetry laboratory also received clinical specimens from the Fukushima radiation accident in 2011, showcasing USUHS/AFRRI's capabilities to support the DoD in case of an accidental radiation exposure or radiological terrorism scenario. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ findings are focused to advance the development and to produce the following: (1) To establish clinically certified processes to permit rapid assessment of radiation exposed specimens; (2) To access radiation exposure by developing and providing biological and biophysical dosimetry capabilities for acute, protracted, and prior radiation exposure; (3) To develop novel triage protocols for rapid assessment of radiation exposure; (4) To establish equipment triage automation to support the ability to manage mass-casualty radiation incidents around the globe.

To that end, our current research priorities are to investigate the health effects of embedded military relevant metals with the aim of identifying a battery of biomarkers to indicate the potential of adverse health effects so that proper treatment paradigms, including surgical removal of the fragment, can be undertaken at the appropriate time. Results from this research will also inform military decision-makers as to whether the fragment removal policy for particular metals needs to be reassessed. In the event that these embedded fragments are radioactive, a thorough understanding of the biokinetics of the metal is essential. Treatment strategies to enhance the elimination of internalized radionuclides are also being investigated, with innovative approaches such as chemical molecularly imprinted polymers and dendrimer complexes at the forefront. Outside collaborations with private industry also provides opportunities to identify and screen novel countermeasures for internal contamination. Research findings are focused to advance the development and to produce the following: (1) effective therapeutics to enhance the elimination of internalized radionuclides; (2) chemically synthesized imprinted polymers with high specific metal binding capabilities (3) novel chemical synthesis and in vitro systems to determine cytotoxicity issues in order to minimize the use of animal models in the study. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Internal Contamination (USUHS): Radioactive material can enter the body by a variety of pathways including ingestion, inhalation, and wound contamination. While some internalized isotopes will be naturally eliminated from the body, many others are not. They remain immobile or are transported and deposited to other organs where they continually irradiate the surrounding tissue. This chronic internal radiation exposure can cause unrepairable cellular damage eventually leading to death. This Program uses innovative organic chemical synthesis (Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (MIPs), the novel development of gastrointestinal organ-on- chip technology and studies on the gut microbiome approaches to address this pressing health concern. First, MIPs have been shown to be highly-efficient and specific metal chelators. In order to expand the applicability of this approach, we synthesize chelation moieties onto dendritic polymer (dendrimers). Dendrimers are non- toxic, highly branched three-dimensional structures whose synthesis can be tightly controlled to yield a product of precise shape and size, thus, becoming highly-specific metal binders and can be tested as therapeutic agents0.153 0.158 0.161 0.000 0.161 Volume Technology (AFRRI) Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 11 R-1 Line #3Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Second, the development of organ-on-chip technology will lead to minimized use of animal models in the study of internal radiation effects. The model utilizes intestinal cell types and three dimensional architecture to mimic intestinal physiology and pathology. This novel 3D culture system will mimic the in vivo animal model and provide new stratagem to investigate the radiation induced gastrointestinal syndrome. This program also explores the internal radiation effects on the gut microbiome, understanding that alterations in the microbiome will share similar pathologic characteristics such as reduced bacterial diversity and the emergence of opportunistic pathogens that provide diagnostics and therapeutic targets. Determining the effect of ionizing radiation on altering the gut microbiome will reveal the effect on physiology, cell survival, inflammation, cytokine expression and metabolism. FY 2023 Plans: (1) The Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affair recognized the need for a better understanding of the health effects of embedded metal fragments and enhanced health surveillance of personnel suffering from such injuries. In response, the Department of Defense Health Affairs issued a directive instructing surgeons to save any excised fragments for further analysis so that the metals could be identified. In addition, the directive compiled a list of \"metals of concern\" to enhance patient follow-up with the establishment of the Toxic Embedded Fragment Center at the Baltimore VA Medical Center in order to follow-up with service members. These developments led to further collaborations between USUHS/AFRRI and the Baltimore DVA, University of Maryland School of Medicine, U.S. FDA, and the University of Kentucky resulting in receiving support by a Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) funded project. (2) Research team will validate signaling pathways by western blot and compare protein expression with age matched control minipig tissues. (3) Research team will perform enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for protein markers for gut leakage/intestinal permeability to support disruption of gut microflora to confirm the data from microbiome analysis. (4) Team will continue with validation of small molecules for gut organ-on-chip model in murine model. (5) An ongoing study to determine the effect of aurin tricarboxylic acid (ATA), a potential countermeasure against internal contamination continues (NIH funding).

RCI's were observed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, where 60-70% of victims received thermal burns concurrent with radiation injury. At the Chernobyl reactor meltdown, 10% of 237 victims exposed to radiation received thermal burns as well. In animal models of RCI including rat, guinea pig, dog, and swine, burns and wounds usually increase mortality after otherwise non-lethal radiation exposures. Consequences of RCI include acute myelosuppression, immune system inhibition, fluid imbalance, macro/microcirculation failure, massive cellular damage, and disruption of vital organ functions, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. There are different syndromes based on the time of manifestation in relation to radiation exposure; acute, delayed, late, and chronic syndromes. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is characterized by the differential response of the important organs to different doses of radiation. The ARS sub-syndromes include been categorized as radioprotectors, radiomitigators, and therapeutics, based on the time of administration in relation to radiation exposure. The majority of countermeasures developed are for specific tissue injuries or specific syndromes. ARS is receiving the most attention, though other syndromes also need equal consideration. A new program and approach has been added to address non-lethal or low-dose radiation health effects that could compromise combat operations if left undiagnosed. Once potential health effects are identified, countermeasures for these non-lethal health effects will be addressed. Currently, treatments for ARS are limited: only the H-ARS has viable therapeutic options and even are limited; Neupogen, Neulasta, Leukine, and Nplate. USUHS/ AFRRI researchers made significant contributions in the initial development of the first three agents. These H-ARS treatments are genetically engineered recombinant growth factors or cytokines that were developed for other indications and recently repurposed for H-ARS. All U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved agents for H-ARS are radiomitigators. No radioprotector, either for H-ARS or GI-ARS has yet been approved for human use. Due to the increasing risk of nuclear and radiological terrorist attacks or accidents has renewed interest in developing radiation medical countermeasures. Our Radiation Countermeasures goals range from exploration of biological processes likely to form the basis of technological solutions, to initial feasibility studies of promising solutions. Program objectives focus on preventing and mitigating the health consequences from exposures to ionizing radiation, in the context of probable threats to U.S. forces in current tactical, humanitarian and counterterrorism mission environments. New protective, and/or combination of FDA approved treatments and therapeutic strategies will broaden the military commander's options for operating within nuclear or radiological environments by minimizing both short-and long-term risks of adverse health consequences.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences/Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (USUHS/AFRRI), is a unique Department of Defense asset, responsible for preserving and protecting the health and performance of U.S. military personnel operating in potential radiologically contaminated multi-domain conventional or hybrid battle spaces and urban environments; through research, education, and operational training that advance understanding of the effects of ionizing radiation in line with the 21st century dynamic threat landscape and national security threats posed by non-state actors, hostile state actors, and near-peer adversaries, as well as providing rapidly deployable radiation medicine expertise in response to a radiological or nuclear event domestically or abroad. The uniqueness of USUHS/AFRRI comes from operating and maintaining state-of-the-art radiation facilities and dosimetry systems to support military relevant radiobiology research. These facilities enable researchers to conduct a wide range of radiobiology experiments in order to investigate militarily-relevant scenarios, and better understand radiation effects and potential mitigation strategies. A team of scientist, physicists, engineers, operators and technicians use proven and traceable dosimetry systems (e.g., ionization chambers, radiochromic film, thermoluminescent dosimeters) and consensus protocols to characterize radiation fields. Due to these facilities our researchers are able to experiment with photons (gamma-rays) which are intended to simulate fallout environments and are delivered by two cobalt-60 facilities - the high-level cobalt facility (HLCF), and for lower (chronic) doses and dose rates, the low-level cobalt facility (LLCF). These type of radiation sources are used for acute and chronic studies of materials, biologic specimens, and small and large animals. The LLCF also provides to our scientist low-dose rate gamma rays to simulate chronic exposure to low absorbed doses. Therefore, it also supports research focused on late or delayed radiation effects in biological specimens. USUHS/AFRRI researchers are also able to use mixed-radiation fields (photons and neutrons) which are available from USUHS/AFRRI's Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomics (TRIGA) reactor. The reactor is operated in either steady-state or pulsed mode to simulate a wide range of prompt exposure scenarios on a nuclear battlefield. The USUHS/AFRRI's TRIGA is the only one dedicated to military radiobiology research. The reactor produces a controlled, self-sustaining fission chain reaction in the reactor core which, in addition to the fuel elements and control rods (containing boron carbide), which includes a neutron start-up source (americium/ beryllium). It is suspended under 4.9 m of water within a pool (an effective radiation shield) in a carriage assembly that allows movement of the core between two exposure rooms for experimental work with large-animal or other studies. The advantages of such a movable reactor core are that the quantity and character of the radiation that reaches the exposure facilities can be controlled, and more than one exposure facility can be used during reactor operations. Our state-of-the-art radiation facilities are also able to provide a wide range of photon and electron irradiations for partial- and whole-body geometries by using a linear accelerator (LINAC) and a small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) providing a range of radiation types, energies, field sizes and dose rates and is extensively used to support standard cell configurations (i.e., 6-, 24- and 96-well plates), and targeted partial body irradiations of mice, minipigs, and nonhuman-primates (NHP) animal models. AFRRI's LINAC is used to produce, monitor, control and form photon or electron beams to the specified target. Whole-body irradiations are also possible Volume 1 - 55PE 0603002DHA: Medical Advanced Technology (AFRRI) Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 8 R-1 Line #4Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2024 Defense Health Agency Date: March 2023 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603002DHA / Medical Advanced Technology (AFRRI) depending on the animal size and desired dose rate. An Xstrahl SARRP facility is capable of operating at 220 kVp and 13 mA yielding a dose rate at the isocenter of approximately 2.6 Gy/min. Onboard portal camera and cone beam computed tomography (CT) imaging systems are used to ensure precise dose delivery. Lung- and gut-only irradiation protocols are approved and have been extensively used to support radiation countermeasure development in the mouse model. Other imaging support is provided by a Philips Brilliance CT big bore scanner. Some features of the scanner include an 85-cm bore size to accommodate larger research subjects, 60- cm true scan field of view and 16-slices per revolution. The above radiation sources and generators are used to support USUHS/AFRRI's current research focus areas which we will address in the following section. Our scientific research goals includes maintaining a pool of highly qualified radiation biologists, and basic and applied research in identification and early development of measures to prevent, assess, and treat radiation injury. USUHS/AFRRI scientists conduct and publish research critical to the Department of Defense for force heath protection and also contribute to the health and well-being of the population at large. USUHS/AFRRI research thrusts include development of diagnosis of radiation induced injury (biodosimetry), internalized radionuclides (internal contamination) and radiation countermeasures. The program capitalizes on findings under PE 0602787HP, Medical Technology, and from industry and academia to advance novel medical countermeasures into and through pre-clinical studies toward newly licensed products. Research findings are mainly focused to advance the development and to produce the following: (1) To establish processes to permit rapid assessment of radiation exposed specimens using novel triage protocols; (2) To developed novel technologies using animal models in the study of radiation effects; (3) To investigate the overall radiation effect by internal contamination in the microbiome and anatomical tissue; (4) To find novel biomarkers, late effects and immunosuppression of radiation injury that can quantitate effects on combat performance decrements; (5) To identify novel therapeutic strategies that will support military operations within a nuclear or radiological environment minimizing ground troops short and long term adverse risk.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences/Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (USUHS/AFRRI), the Biodosimetry program addresses clinical symptoms of radiation exposure, reach back reference capabilities. Biodosimetry is the only method to detect, assess and estimate radiation dose exposure and is critical for military missions and saving lives. AFRRI prepared an in-depth Business Case Analysis and is strategically poised to establish the DoD's Advanced Biodosimetry Network (DABN), meeting the objective of US Senate Report SR 114-63. The established network would be complemented with the Diagnostic Biodosimetry Laboratory that aligns with the DoD Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program (CLIP). CLIP describes requirements within the respective DoD's Active and Reserve Components and facilities under their supervision to include oversight, inspections, proficiency testing (PT), personnel standards, and training in laboratories performing testing on human specimens so that clinical decisions can be made [reference DoDI 6440.02]\". The Biodosimetry laboratory also received clinical specimens from the Fukushima radiation accident in 2011, showcasing USUHS/AFRRI's capabilities to support the DoD in case of an accidental radiation exposure or radiological terrorism scenario. The Biodosimetry program capitalizes on findings under PE 0602787HP, Medical Technology, and from industry and academia to advance novel medical countermeasures into and through pre-clinical studies toward newly licensed products. Research findings are focused to advance the development and production of the following: (1) To establish clinically certified processes to permit rapid assessment of radiation exposed specimens; (2) To assess radiation exposure by developing and providing biological and biophysical dosimetry capabilities for acute, protracted, and prior radiation exposure; (3) To develop novel triage protocols for rapid assessment of radiation exposure; (4) To establish equipment triage automation to support the ability to manage mass-casualty radiation incidents around the globe. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs on findings under PE 0602787HP, Medical Technology, and from industry and academia to advance novel medical countermeasures into and through pre-clinical studies toward newly licensed products. FY 2023 Plans: (1) To continue providing Department of Defense radiobiology - biodosimetry expert reach back support. (2) To participate in CBRNE/WMD NATO and military operations exercises.

The CBMN is a comprehensive system for measuring DNA damage, cytostasis and cytotoxicity. DNA damage events are scored specifically in once-divided binucleated (BN) cells and include (a) micronuclei (MNi), a biomarker of chromosome breakage and/or whole chromosome loss, (b) nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs), a biomarker of DNA misrepair and/or telomere end-fusions, and (c) nuclear buds (NBUDs), a biomarker of elimination of amplified DNA and/or DNA repair complexes. Cytostatic effects are measured via the proportion of mono-, bi- and multinucleated cells and cytotoxicity via necrotic and/ or apoptotic cell ratios. Further information regarding mechanisms leading to MNi, NPBs and NBUDs formation is obtained using centromere and/or telomere probes. The assay has the probability to be applied successfully for biomonitoring of in vivo genotoxic radiation exposure, in vitro radiation genotoxicity testing and in diverse research fields such as nutrigenomics and pharmacogenomics as well as a predictor of normal tissue and tumor radiation sensitivity and cancer risk. (7) To test the CBMN assay for triage automation and multivariable linear regression analysis to compare with already proven and globally accepted assays. (8) To establish a surge request procedure for cytogenetic analysis by developing sex and age-dependent CBMN dose-response calibrations curves and validate specimens cryopreservation protocols for delayed analysis using the metaphase-spread chromosome aberrations (i.e., DCA, PCC) assays.

RCI's were observed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, where 60-70% of victims received thermal burns concurrent with radiation injury. At the Chernobyl reactor meltdown, 10% of 237 victims exposed to radiation received thermal burns as well. In animal models of RCI including rat, guinea pig, dog, and swine, burns and wounds usually increase mortality after otherwise non-lethal radiation exposures. Consequences of RCI include acute myelosuppression, immune system inhibition, fluid imbalance, macro/microcirculation failure, massive cellular damage, and disruption of vital organ functions, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. There are different syndromes based on the time of manifestation in relation to radiation exposure; acute, delayed, late, and chronic syndromes. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is characterized by the differential response of the important organs to different doses of radiation. The ARS sub-syndromes include categorized as radioprotectors, radiomitigators, and therapeutics, based on the time of administration in relation to radiation exposure. The majority of countermeasures developed are for specific tissue injuries or specific syndromes. ARS is receiving the most attention, though other syndromes also need equal consideration.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Guidance for Development of the Force - Medical Technology Development: This program element (PE) provides funding for promising candidate solutions that are selected for initial safety and effectiveness testing in animal studies and/or small scale human clinical trials regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration prior to licensing for human use. Research in this PE is designed to address areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense regarding Wounded Warriors, capabilities identified through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, and sustainment of Department of Defense and multi-agency priority investments in science, technology, research, and development. Medical research, development, test, and evaluation priorities for the Defense Health Program (DHP) are guided by, and will support, the National Defense Strategy, the National Research Action Plan for Improving Access to Mental Health Services for Veterans, Service Members, and Military Families, and the National Biodefense Strategy. Program development and execution is peer reviewed and coordinated with all of the Military Services, appropriate Defense agencies or activities and other federal agencies, to include the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services. As research efforts mature, the most promising will transition to advanced concept development funding, PE 0604110. For knowledge products, successful findings will transition into clinical practice guidelines. Three Centers of Excellence (CoEs) receive medical technology development funds. Management of the Breast and Gynecological Cancer CoEs transfer from the Army to the Uniformed Services University beginning in FY 2017. The Cardiac Health CoE provides evidence-based personalized patient engagement approaches for comprehensive cardiac event prevention through education, outcomes research and technology tools, as well as molecular research to detect cardiovascular disease at an early stage to ultimately discover a signature for cardiovascular health, to find new genes that significantly increase risk for heart attack in Service members and other beneficiaries, and identify molecular markers of obesity and weight loss. For the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, this program element includes funds for research management support costs. The Outside Continental US (OCONUS) laboratories conduct focused medical research on vaccine development for Malaria, Diarrhea Diseases, and Dengue Fever. In addition to entomology, HIV studies, surveillance and outbreak response under the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program and risk assessment studies on a number of other infectious diseases that are present in the geographical regions where the laboratories are located. The CONUS laboratories conduct research on Military Operational Medicine, Combat Casualty Care, Diving and Submarine Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Environmental and Occupational Health, Directed Energy, and Aviation Medicine and Human Performance.

Expeditionary Medicine is focused on care on the battlefield and in field hospitals prior to transporting patients out of theater to CONUS, and studies trauma resuscitation, hemorrhage control, and other life-saving interventions to keep critically wounded patients alive in the golden hour and to the next level of care. The AFMS is the only service transporting patients on long aeromedical evacuation missions. Therefore, the En-Route care thrust area studies include investigation on the impact of transport on patient and providers (including cabin altitude, noise, vibration, and environmental issues affecting physiology on the aircraft), patient safety factors during transport, medical technologies for use during transport, and research to support education and training with simulation for En-Route care providers. The Human Performance thrust area focuses on optimizing airmen physical and psychological performance, assessing the physical and cognitive demands on the operator (pilot/aircrew), facilitating a safe aviation environment through technology and equipment assessment, and improving/ sustaining airmen performance through training. Medical development and biomedical technology investments in FHP seek to deliver an improved FHP capability across the full spectrum of operations with research that prevents injury/ illness through improved identification and control of health risks. Under FHP, sub-project areas include Occupational Hazard Exposure (Includes Flight Hazards and Integrated Risk), Targeted Risk Identification, Mitigation and Treatment (Formerly Pathogen ID and Novel Therapeutics and includes Big Data), FHP Technologies Development and Assessment (Assay and disease detection), and Health Surveillance, Infection, Injury & Immunity. FHP also includes Innovations and Personalized Medicine. Operational medicine is focused on in garrison care - our next most critical issue post OIF/OEF - and how to care for the whole patient and consideration of comorbidities in treatment of wounded warriors and dependents. For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), medical development programs include the Prostate Cancer Center of Excellence (CoE), the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM), the Pain CoE, the Breast Cancer CoE, and the Gynecological Cancer CoE. The Prostate CoE, formerly a CSI, was chartered in 1992 to conduct basic, clinical, and translational research programs to combat diseases of the prostate. The Center's mission is fulfilled primarily through its three principal programs -- the Clinical Translational Research Center, the Basic Science Research Program, and the Tri-Service Multicenter Prostate Cancer Database, which encompasses its clinical research work with other participating military medical centers. These affiliated sites contribute data and biospecimens obtained from prostate cancer patients who participate in clinical trials. CNRM brings together the expertise of clinicians and scientists across disciplines to catalyze innovative approaches to TBI research. CNRM research programs emphasize aspects of high relevance to military populations, with a primary focus on patients at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Our twelve program projects run in parallel rather than in sequence with advances implemented over five years rather than 12 months. Some subprojects target discovery investigations and mechanistic studies whereas others focus on clinical evaluations, population studies and further development leading to deployment. The introduction of new subprojects and maturation of other subprojects allows the GYN-COE to continue to emphasize military and clinical relevance, prioritize bench to bedside translation, and infuse in advances in science, medicine and technology to meet our objectives. The Gynecologic Cancer Center of Excellence (GYN-COE) is an integrated translational research program aimed at development of companion biomarkers and assays, clinical decision support tools, risk assessment algorithms, quality improvement initiatives, treatments, and interventions for patients with gynecologic tumors and cancers, among a growing proportion of active duty women in the Armed Services, veteran and retired populations. Molecular profiling of pre-cancerous and malignant lesions has also enabled development of diagnostic and chemo-preventive interventions across the most common pathologic uterine conditions, rare variants, and the aggressive and deadly metastatic and recurrent malignancies that affect women and corresponding readiness. The GYN-COE has been the leading research program in the U.S. to identify clinical features, biologic etiologies, and social determinants underlying racial and ethnic disparities in gynecologic cancers using population based as well as translational research methods. The GYN-COE program features both the largest tissue laser capture microscopy facility as well as the most robust mass spectrometry-based proteomics facility in the DoD, enabling the program to assess the generalized relevance of GYN-COE discoveries in other cancers that impact service members and readiness. The comprehensive research program supports the training of subspecialty gynecologic oncology surgeons, a fellowship program that has trained advanced pelvic surgeons to support wartime efforts for the past 50 years. The program also educates and trains medical students, interns and residents in women's health, telemedicine, wellness, wound-healing, hemorrhage, infections, pain management, resistance, resilience, palliative care and evidence- based medicine. The program has partnered with the National Cancer Institute in its educational and investigative activities over the past 20 years becoming a pillar program for the Murtha Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Uniformed Services University. The GYN-COE has also strengthened cancer capabilities, advanced the federal precision oncology initiatives, contributed to the COVID-response, enabled delivery of equitable care to female service members, veterans and beneficiaries, and ensured readiness of the female fighting force by addressing their gender-specific medical conditions.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DoD Cancer Moonshot - Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) Consortium (USUHS) DoD's Cancer Moonshot requirement is a mission of the Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at USUHS under the authority of a tri-federal Memorandum of Agreement signed July 2016 by the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (DoD), the Under Secretary of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs (VHA), and the Acting Director of the National Cancer Institute (NIH), for a tri-federal program of Clinical Proteogenomics Cancer Research. DoD's Cancer Moonshot promotes readiness and mission accomplishment of the active duty service member (ADSM) force, as well as military beneficiaries, retirees, and veterans. There are about 1,000 ADSMs who are stricken with a new cancer diagnosis annually, and MCC serves as the DoD's Health Affairs-approved Center of Excellence for cancer care and research for these ADSMs. MCCRP's mission is to bring translational cancer research to all patients in order to improve their health and mission performance, and to help prevent, screen, detect, and treat cancer; minimize side effects of cancer treatments; and return to duty ADSMs stricken with cancer, as well as all other DoD beneficiaries. DoD's Cancer Moonshot initiative allows for the provision of state-of-the-art molecular analysis of tumors and blood of cancer patients which will result in increased force readiness through more targeted treatment of cancers with fewer side effects, as well as better screening for cancer risk and development.

Accomplishments/Planned Murtha Cancer Center Research Program MCCRP) is a research program consisting of two overall projects, the first known as APOLLO (Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes), and the second as DoD Framingham. APOLLO is a novel high-throughput molecular analysis of every DNA (gene), RNA, and protein expression molecule in cancer patient tumors. Such analysis has never been done on a large scale across multiple cancer types, and small pilot studies demonstrate that the APOLLO project will result in unprecedented findings across all types of cancer (with specific focus on cancers of the greatest threat to ADSMs). These new findings will be identified by using state-of-the-art tissue collection procedures in the operating rooms of all patients undergoing cancer surgery at MCCRP collection protocol sites (e.g. Walter Reed, the entire DNA genome and RNA sequence at USUHS, while analyzing the entire protein expression profile of these same cancers in MCCRP's Proteomics Laboratory, as well as other affiliated protein laboratories. The vast molecular data that will be derived from these analyses (in the terabyte and petabyte range and beyond) will be linked to clinical patient data as well as treatment outcomes data. These combined data sets will be housed in National Cancer Institute (NCI) secure cloud-based servers with restricted access for analytics by teams of bioinformatics experts (i.e., from government, university, and corporate entities) across the United States working on this endeavor. This complete bio molecular (global) expression profiling of thousands of cancers of all types seen in military treatment and other facilities will predictably result in a myriad of new discoveries regarding the way cancers develop, progress, respond to treatment, evade treatment, and spread. It also will result in new ways to combat cancers and minimize side effects of cancer treatment, as well as identify novel cancer screening and prevention opportunities, while focusing on militarily-relevant cancers and ADSMs with cancer, distinguishing it from any effort that might develop in the future in a civilian organization, as none of this scale exists today. There are now 8 specific APOLLO sub-projects, which are classified based on the organ type of cancer under study: APOLLO 1 = Lung cancer - 10th Highest Cause of Cancer in Active Duty; APOLLO 2 = Gynecological cancer - 12th Highest Cause of Cancer in Active Duty; APOLLO 3 = Prostate cancer - 3rd Highest Cause of Cancer in Active Duty; APOLLO 4 = Breast cancer - 5th Highest Cancer in Active Duty; and APOLLO 5 = prospectively-collected VA, DoD, and NCI specimens and data for all organ sites, APOLLO 6: Pancreatic Cancer - 13th Highest Cause of Cancer in Active Duty and APOLLO 7 : Testicular Germ Cell Tumors - Highest Cause of Cancer in Active Duty and APOLLO 8 Glioblastoma the 7th highest cause of Cancer in Active Duty.

Accomplishments/Planned addition to the primary achievement of research objectives, the program educates Federal employees as a benefit to the public they serve through Federal service, through support to civil authorities, and in non-Federal professional and academic collaborations. FY 2023 Plans: Specifically, the APOLLO project will collect, process, and analyze cancer specimens from patients who have been diagnosed with cancer or at risk for cancer and who are eligible for and have consented to the protocols. All MCCRP tissue source sites will be utilized which include 8 MTFs and MEDCENS in the MHS, as well as 3 VA sites and one civilian site. Active duty service members diagnosed with cancer at these MHS locations will be preferentially prioritized for offers of enrollment in APOLLO in order to make sure the DoD is providing state-of- the-art research and clinical translational care opportunities to our active duty force to maintain and sustain the highest level of Readiness. The program will complete the following tasks: Task 1: Patients will be recruited and consented for this APOLLO protocol after being successfully recruited into and following the established procedures for the protocols: Establishment of a Tissue Repository for the Murtha Cancer Center Biobank (MCCB), Tissue and Blood Library Establishment for Molecular, Biochemical, and Histologic Study of Breast Disease, and Creation of a Blood Library for the Analysis of Blood for Molecular Changes Associated with Breast Disease and Breast Cancer Development. Task 2: Clinical data collection and quality assurance will follow the established procedures for the sample and data collection protocols. In addition, data may be obtained for the APOLLO study from the DoD Central Tumor Registry (OncoLog) or from the electronic medical records of APOLLO study participants. Task 3: Clinical pathologic slide imaging data will be collected for APOLLO study participants.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Program - DoD Framingham Longitudinal Study Description: DoD Framingham is a novel project that is enabled by the blood serum specimens stored at the DoD Serum Repository (DoDSR) at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) in Silver Spring, Maryland. This facility stores blood serum drawn from over 10 million ADSMs who were required to undergo mandatory semiannual blood testing for the last 25 years, resulting in this repository with over 65 million blood serum specimens. MCC tumor registry data, which includes every ADSM who developed cancer while on active duty, is matched to data in the Serum Repository. This allows MCC to identify the blood serum of ADSMs who ultimately develop cancer at key times, i.e., before they had cancer, during their cancer treatment, and after their successful cancer treatment. Four different serum specimens (two before, one during, and one after cancer diagnosis and treatment) from every ADSM who developed certain types of cancer over a ten-year period of time are then sent to the Nation's foremost protein identification (mass spectroscopy) center, i.e., the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) run by the Department of Energy (DOE). This enables identification of the entire proteome circulating in the blood serum of these cancer patients before, during, and after cancer diagnosis.

Smaller studies of this nature done by MCC researchers have proven that this is an effective strategy to identify novel diagnostic and treatment protein expression biomarkers that can be assayed in new blood tests for cancer. This project will do it \"at scale\", i.e. in large numbers of active duty cancer patients (who are otherwise healthy and therefore do not have the \"confounding\" protein markers of old age, diabetes, and other medical issues). By using serums that go back many years before the ADSM was diagnosed with cancer, the earliest markers of cancer that will be identified, and assays will be performed by another U.S. governmental agency with the best protein detection and analysis tools in the world. Eight specific DoD Framingham sub-projects, classified based on the organ type of cancer, will be conducted: Framingham 1 = Oropharyngeal cancer; Framingham 2 = Lymphoma; Framingham 3 = Melanoma; Framingham 4 = Pancreatic cancer; Framingham 5 = Metastatic Cancer to Bone (of any type); and Framinghams 6 through 8 subtypes will be determined by MCC and NCI experts in the coming months. FY 2023 Plans: Specifically, the program will perform the following tasks. Task 1: The Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Pathology Center's (JPC) Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR) and OncoLog systems will be queried for patients with the identified cancer subject. Task 2: JPC will send the list of approximately 150 identified cancer patients to the AFHSB in order to requisition their sera. Sera from the year of diagnosis, two years pre-diagnosis, four years pre- diagnosis, and two years post-diagnosis will be requisitioned. Each of the 150 patients with identified cancer will be matched by age and sex to 150 controls who were cancer-free for the duration of their active component service, as well as free of autoimmunity, transplant, or immune suppression. Four longitudinal sera samples from each control will be requisitioned to correspond to the time points of the case sera. Task 3: The approximately 150 identified cancer subjects and 150 matched controls, each with up to four longitudinal serum samples for each Framingham project (for a total of about 1,200 serum samples for each Framingham project), will be sent to Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) for comprehensive discovery- based quantitative proteomics measurements using the advanced LC-MS/MS platforms established at PNNL. Task 4: Dissemination of data to analysts at the PNNL and in conjunction with Murtha Cancer Center Research Program (MCCRP) at USUHS, who will perform at PNNL statistical analysis by the PNNL Bioinformatics team to examine whether any of the target peptides or group of peptides can be distinguished between the patients and their matched controls for each specific aim of this study.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Improved Medical Readiness and Healthcare Delivery Description: The \"Health Research for Improved Medical Readiness and Healthcare Delivery\" program at USUHS answers fundamental questions of importance to the military mission of the Department of Defense in five (5) distinct portfolio areas: health services research, global health engagement, precision medicine, women's health, and infectious disease clinical research. Portfolio 1: The mission of the Center for Health Services Research (CHSR) supports the readiness of America's Warfighter and improved health outcomes for the military community by building capacity throughout the Military Health System (MHS) to conduct health services research that supports MHS goals, the Department of Defense's (DoD's) mission and the national security strategy. The program will address the lack of system- wide health care evidence to support policy and decision making and insufficient health services research capability to analyze MHS data for building a ready force, protecting and treating the warfighter, and providing efficient, effective, quality and safe healthcare. CHSR is the only group specifically focusing on system-wide improvement for the MHS and responding directly to priority research requests from the DHA, OSD(HA), and other Federal agencies. This support directly enables DHA RDA Priorities of prioritizing transition and incorporating modernization priorities, which cannot be done without timely, accurate, evidence-based information on which to base decisions. CHSR aligns to joint requirements and meets the JCIDS identified gaps of DK1 and DK3 [DK1: Inconsistent approach to producing knowledge products and tools. 1) Inadequate process to introduce public health surveillance into RDT&E. 2) Inadequate surveillance, data capture, and exposure documentation tracking. 3) Inconsistent use and application of Service's lessons learned information and how it11.022 11.631 11.883 0.000 11.883 Volume 1 - 140PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 79 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA / Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 506 / Health Research for Improved Medical Readiness and Healthcare Delivery (USUHS) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs RDT&E; DK3: Lack a decision support mechanism that enables timely, accurate decisions and diagnosis at all levels of care]. Recently the CHSR was tapped to lead work on Ukrainian health and trauma system that will build Operational Care knowledge for future US readiness. Portfolio 2: Global Health Engagement (GHE) research is related to operational efforts and advanced technology development efforts that will meet the needs of the Joint Force in either improving the understanding and/or execution of DoD GHE, or utilizing DoD health research activities to engage a partner nation/partner nations in support of Combatant Command Campaign Plan objectives to further research. The GHE research needs of the warfighter are expressed by the regular demand signal of the Joint Force through the Office of the Joint Staff Surgeon (OJSS) and the Combatant Commands (CCMDs) Surgeons' Offices. Portfolio 3: The Center for Military Precision Health's (CMPH, formerly known as PRIMER) mission is to conduct innovative research applying genomic science, discoveries, and precision techniques to enhance the health, readiness and well-being of the Warfighter and DoD beneficiaries. CMPH provides standardized state of the art genome and molecular profiling services, genomic data analysis, and genomic data storage under DoD security and privacy compliance policies, addressing 8 separate DoD requirements across the MHS while also providing education in genomic information and performing clinical implementation research in the field of genomic medicine to inform policy and clinical practice guidelines for use of genomics in the MHS. CPMH enables HHS- and DOD-study subjects to participate in translational genomic research studies for human disease and conditions of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, suicide-associated behaviors, cardiovascular disease, lung, prostate, breast, gynecological and other human cancers, traumatic brain injury and dementia and other complex human diseases. To date, The American Genome Center at CMPH has completed genomic and transcriptomic profiling on over 120,000 human samples and, MiCOR has screened 4,500 midshipmen for asymptomatic cardiovascular disease. CMPH also supports the Military Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (MiCOR) program to address gap areas identified in the Initial Capabilities Document for Cardiovascular Care with the first prospective genomic evaluation of cardiac arrest in the military (GEMINI study). Current collaborations with MiCOR in focus areas of sudden death examinations and pharmacogenomics are also active to address preventative measures for soldier readiness and health. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic CMPH scientists are collaborating with The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the DoD study EPICC via IDCRP, to provide state of the art molecular profiling and analysis of individuals with COVID related illness. These program projects directly address risk Volume 1 - 141PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 80 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA / Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 506 / Health Research for Improved Medical Readiness and Healthcare Delivery (USUHS) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs for chronic and severe COVID-related health conditions after viral infection in young service members for readiness measures. Portfolio 4: The Military Women's Health research program's (MWHRP) mission is to foster research that influences policy and guides best practices for the health care of Active-Duty Service Women (ADSW) and Veterans. The Military Women's Health Research Consortium fosters aggregation and facilitates research that supports an operationally ready and deployable female force, improves accessibility and quality of healthcare that addresses the unique health needs of ADSW and veterans, and spans the life course of ADSW as they transition from military service to VA care. Portfolio 5: The Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program (IDCRP) designs and executes multicenter infectious diseases clinical research focusing on high-impact cohorts and interventional trials, to inform and improve care of the Warfighter. The focus is on emerging infections, antimicrobial resistance, and other high priority infections impacting military readiness in US and abroad. IDCRP will generate research evidence to inform warfighter care, develop DoD clinical practice guidance, assess cost effectiveness of interventions, and assist force health protection policy development. IDCRP has continued to focus efforts on DoD-relevant epidemiology efforts plus therapeutic and prophylactics aimed at COVID-19. FY 2023 Plans: CHSR FY 2023 Goals Investigate racial disparities across our top 10 service lines of the MHS: This was recommended by the Defense Health Board and MHS leaders but at present we lack sufficient funds to undertake this research. Low-value care (LVC) in the MHS: This project directly addresses the 2022 NDAA charging the MHS with reduction of LVC, but funding is scheduled to end in FY23, which will also result in loss of data for continuing the project if funding is not renewed. Global Burden of Disease in the MHS: uses claims data from the MHS Data Repository (MDR) in an epidemiological methods framework to examine the total burden of disease, measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), across civilian and military MHS beneficiaries. The two study aims are: 1) measure and describe the diseases and injuries related to the loss of health in the MHS population; and 2) investigate changes in population-level health status over time.

Innovate automated high throughput workflows for established manual methodologies (e.g., single cell transcriptome library preparation, whole genome bisulfite sequencing and synthetic long read genome sequencing). TAGC is currently implementing and validating a robotic liquid handling platform with a single adaptable deck layout for versatile multiomics workflows. The validation of this platform setup will enable replication of these workflows at other sites of laboratory activity with minimal implementation factors. 2. TAGC will establish a minimal set of pre-analytical assessment factors and workflow quality control metrics to provide as a manual of operations to collaborative laboratories for data generation homogeneity into a common data biobank for networked studies. As a component to establishing multi-site, multi-study features to molecular profiling studies, the TAGC scientific team and CMPH Data Science Core will established several cloud-based storage protocols and analytical pipelines for integrated genomics analysis to share primary data and analyzed results with team-selected investigators. 3. The American Genome Center will implement a shared resource of educational documents and protocols for distribution to the research community, will evaluate applications, methodologies and platforms for single molecule sequencing and will facilitate the establishment of operational components parallel to clinical Production Sequencing compliance standards. These activities will directly address the medical, educational and research needs for genomic medicine initiatives at the university and for collaborative federal government and DoD partner laboratory sites. 4. Recruitment of a Medical Geneticist, and other clinical research genetics personnel. These individuals will supplement existing key personnel. Specifically, the Clinical Implementation Division will improve variant interpretation and curation pipelines to support clinical genomic activities.

Military Women's Health Research Program (MWHRP) FY23 Goals: - The creation of a USUHS women's health tracking system and repository for all USUHS women's health research and evidence-based projects. - MWHRC will provide monthly reporting to the Health Affair's Women in Service Working Group meetings. The Military Women's Research Consortium expects to allot $3.6M to funds up to 3 Military Women's Health Research Consortium Awards for the first year with continuing funding up to 3 years, subject to availability of funds. Continued funding is dependent upon assessments of performance based on factors including in-progress review and quarterly progress reports. The award will support translational research targeting specific Focus Areas of Military Women's Health. Translational research is defined as work that \"translates\" basic science concepts and ideas into clinically relevant solutions and meaningful health outcomes with a view toward evaluating the feasibility of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, clinical guidance, emerging approaches and technologies, promising new products, and/ or pharmacologic agents. To meet the intent of this award mechanism, each research project must specifically address one or more of the Military Women's Health Focus Areas identified by the VA/DOD Women's Health Clinical Care Community and the HA Women in Service Working Group (WIS WG). IDCRP FY23-24 Goals: - Ongoing and PASS, MRAP and PAIVED protocols, including: o Vaccine correlates of protection research (EPICC, PASS, PAIVED) o A comprehensive Long COVID research road map which includes predictive studies and mechanistic studies (EPICC, MRAP), with potential applications to clinical trial endpoint design.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs analyses on EPICC, PASS and PAIVED which will culminate in major mechanistic studies for influenza and SARS-CoV-2. o The MRAP study will provide rolling COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness estimates for ADSM as booster recommendations change and new variants circulate. - Complete enrollment and analysis of the two deployment RCTs (P2 and Treat TD 2.0) to support CPG requirements. - Newly established SSTI data and specimen repository protocol will leverage previously collected data and specimens from legacy SSTI protocols to conduct comprehensive analyses to support SSTI mitigation efforts in high-risk military populations. - Evaluate DoD Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASP) on an enterprise level and provide a technical report on stewardship practices to the DoD ASP Working Group to inform process improvements within the DoD. The protocol is in direct support of a USUHS Public Health PhD thesis. - An acute respiratory infection (ARI) repository protocol - the IDCRP is currently planning a joint ARI protocol data and specimen repository protocol derived from the above and other ARI protocols. This will enable pooled subject level meta-analyses to answer current and emerging questions with improved statistical power, and allow pilot analyses and sample size calculations for new ARI protocols. This will further serve as critical resource for new assay development for future ARI pandemics which threaten Force Health. - Commence an augmented respiratory surveillance protocol at the US Naval Academy to inform ARI management and prevention in congregate military settings as a platform to rapidly characterize the epidemiology of emerging new respiratory infection threats (including new variants) and evaluate real world evidence for non-pharmaceutical interventions and licensed ARI medical countermeasures. This in turn will help inform practice guidelines for acute respiratory infections for service academies, training, and other congregate settings (inc. shipboard).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This program supports drug discovery for chronic traumatic and encephalopathy/neurodegenerative disease. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs and Disease Prevention, Treatment and Research Description: Service members who have served in combat and have received repeated impact and/or blast TBIs are at risk for developing Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and other neurodegenerative diseases with significant persistent behavioral/neurologic manifestations. Currently, there are no validated means for diagnosing these problems in living patients or drugs to prevent and treat them. The mission of our program is to develop drugs that will effectively block the formation of tau prions that can be entered into clinical trials for the prevention and/or treatment of CTE and other neurodegenerative disorders in at-risk active duty and retired service members. Using human brain specimens, CTE has been now shown to qualify as a transmissible tau prion disorder. To date, over 320,000 novel chemical compounds have been tested for their ability to interfere with in vitro tau prion formation. Several active compounds have been identified and using medicinal chemistry, we have attempted to improve their bioavailability and lower toxicity profiles. Such candidate drugs are now being tested for efficacy in animal models of tau prion disorders. Newly developed techniques to identify the presence of tau prions in brain samples have been developed and have now been shown to be efficient and highly sensitive. FY 2023 Plans: While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to constrain our pace of research, we plan to screen an additional 100,000 chemical compounds for potential effects of tau prion formation. Compounds identified with such properties will undergo medicinal chemistry analog studies to enhance biologic efficacy. The newly developed, highly sensitive tau prion assay techniques will be used on currently available and newly obtained human brain specimens and animal models to identify the presence, distribution and time-course of tau prion involvement of the brain. We will continue to further develop animal models which overexpress human tau and employ these for pathogenesis, infectivity and drug efficacy studies. Animal models to be actively investigated include Tg23027 mice, Tg12099 rats, hMAPT-Kl mice, and ferrets. 14.415 Volume 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 87 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA / Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 507 / Brain Injury and Disease Prevention, Treatment and Research (USUHS) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs tau isoforms and remove their impact from the propagation of human tau prions is ongoing. Using CryoEM compare the three-dimensional structures of prions to conformations from other non-TBI tauopathies including Alzheimer's Disease and Down Syndrome. Recognizing the realities of working in the COVID era, activities towards obtaining fresh frozen brain specimens from deceased Service Members who developed CTE will be cautiously expanded in order to provide additional isolates in order to expand our tau prion drug discovery program. FY 2024 Base Plans: Plans for FY2024 reflect a continuation of a multiyear effort to generate effective therapeutics and, as such, include many of the same ongoing activities from FY2023. We plan to screen an additional 100,000 chemical compounds for potential effects of tau prion formation. Compounds identified with such properties will undergo medicinal chemistry manipulation to enhance bioavailability and lessen toxicity profiles. To that end, we will synthesize and assay an average of 20 new designer inhibitors per week, for a total of 1,000 in the year. We will characterize drug-like properties of new analogs: we will test at least 450 new compounds for microsomal stability, 100 compounds for membrane permeability and assess the non-specific protein binding of another 250 through the course of the year. We will continue to further develop and utilize animal models which overexpress human tau and employ these for pathogenesis, infectivity and drug efficacy studies. High resolution Cryo-EM studies will proceed to create a model that further defines the specific atomic structure of tau prions related to CTE. Knowledge gained from this atomic structural model will be used as a selective template for screening the chemical compounds for their efficacy against CTE-related tau prion formation. We will identify a preclinical PET ligand for MSA prions to use in rodents. Correlate in vivo displacement of PET ligand to effective concentration of MSA drugs in the brains of rodent models. These research strategies align with the National Defense Strategy and MHS Strategic Goals & Objectives as articulated in the recently released Warfighter Brain Health Strategy & Action Plan (see page 9, \"Develop medical countermeasures to reduce or eliminate long-term and/or late effects following TBI.\" FY Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 88 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA / Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 507 / Brain Injury and Disease Prevention, Treatment and Research (USUHS) C.

Research is necessary to guide policy and ensure optimal delivery of behavioral health training and services across the continuum of care and deployment cycle. Threats addressed by this research component include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, family separation, and family violence. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs Resilience Description: STARRS-LS, the longitudinal successor studies to the groundbreaking Army STARRS research studies conducted from 2009 to 2015, includes the largest studies of military suicidal behaviors ever undertaken. In addition, STARRS studies have yielded a wealth of information about a variety of other health issues relevant to the military. STARRS-LS seeks to expand and extend the original research effort by continuing to follow cohorts comprised of the original participants, including expanding the Historical Administrative Data Study to include more than 3 million active-duty Soldiers from 2004 to 2019. STARRS-LS uses Big Data techniques and predictive analytics to develop knowledge that allow the Army and DoD to develop products from the knowledge. The volume, breadth and depth of the data compiled for large representative samples of Soldiers, and the unique combination of survey data, health outcome data, and genetic data, allow extensive state-of-the-art analyses. Because the data are available at the Army Analytics Group (AAG) Research Facilitation Laboratory (RFL), analytic opportunities are available for researchers other than the STARRS Research Team. The STARRS Research Team meets, presents findings, and shares ideas regularly with DoD and Army representatives who serve on the STARRS Government Steering Committee (includes representation from ASD- HA, Sec of Army, Army SG), the STARRS Research Advisory Team, DSPO and other groups to ensure that the STARRS research aligns with current DoD/DHP priorities. The STARRS Research Team has published 115 papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals so far.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ for Improved Medical Diagnoses, Rehabilitation and Warfighter Readiness Description: The \"Innovative Technologies for Improved Medical Diagnoses, Rehabilitation and Warfighter Readiness\" program at USUHS is designed to answer fundamental questions of importance to the military medical mission of the Department of Defense in the three portfolio areas: Transforming Technology for the Warfighter (TTW), Surgical Critical Care, and the Rehabilitation Sciences Research. Portfolio 1: The Transforming Technology for the Warfighter (TTW) program supports USUHS partnerships with other DoD biomedical labs, civilian universities and medical centers (including minority serving institutions), and the National Institutes of Health to advance and deliver new technologies to improve warfighter health and readiness. Research projects, which focus primarily on the Combat Casualty Care, Military Operational Medicine, and Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine defense medical R&D areas of interest, are selected based on scientific peer review and programmatic review with an emphasis on direct relevance to identified military needs, translational potential, and clear strategy for product commercialization. Specifically, the program aims to advance Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 projects to TRL 4/5/6 within a maximum of three (3) to five (5) year performance period. Although the program is built around the needs of the warfighter, it also advances civilian care by supporting projects that benefit both the warfighter and the general public. The TTW program fully supports the DoD's Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) and continually works to link projects to DoD requirements documents, including the 2008 Initial Capability Documents (ICD) for Military Operational Medicine, the 2014 ICD for Combat Casualty Care (CCC) Devices and Products, the 201513.623 14.505 14.916 0.000 14.916 Volume 1 - 153PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 92 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA / Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 509 / Innovative Technologies for Improved Medical Diagnoses, Rehabilitation and Warfighter Readiness (USUHS) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs Training Technologies, the 2015 ICD for CCC Medical R&D, and the 2017 ICD for Clinical and Rehabilitative Medicine. Portfolio 2: The Surgical Critical Care Initiative (SC2i), a consortium of 7 institutions (USU, Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, NMRC, Duke, Emory, DecisionQ), enrolls critically ill patients (as well as healthy controls), leveraging medical and multi-omics data to develop Clinical Decision Support Tools (CDSTs) that will improve clinical outcomes and lower resource utilization across military and civilian healthcare systems. The CDSTs will further assist readiness by either accelerating return to duty (abridged length-of-stay across the ICU, general ward, and rehabilitation continuum of care) and curbing medical resource burdens. The SC2i also collaborates with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh, University of South Florida, Brooke Army Medical Center, University of Vermont, among others. Through collecting patient specimens, laboratory testing, microbial analytics, and data modeling, our CDSTs will augment individual precision medicine, decrease the Warfighter's healing time, and accelerate their return to readiness. The SC2i is transforming patient data into actionable information, improving diagnosis in healthcare, and reducing the cost of care through early detection of surgical complications. Our current focus is on 3 CDSTs to aid in advanced Sepsis prediction, timing of wound closure, and early detections of pneumonia, bacteremia, and venous thromboembolism. The AIDEx (Sepsis and other Decompensation) tool will be launched into the BAMC in FY23, with use in nine other military medical facilities within the year following. Additionally, the SC2i is working with the Office of Regulated activities to develop a regulatory strategy for the AIDEx tool for the FDA using a predicate 510(k) pathway. This tool aims to predict sepsis 6-12 hours prior to onset. The WounDx CDST should be in place prior to FY27 in multiple MHS and civilian facilities. WounDx addresses an unmet clinical need of uncertainty in the timing of wound closure; additionally, it will lessen the number of dehisced wounds, which occur in an approximately 15-30% of wounded warriors. Other CSDTs include diagnosis of acute kidney injury, severe traumatic brain injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, open abdomen infections, appendicitis, heterotopic ossification, and snakebite recovery. We have 2 CDSTs currently in use in the MHS or civilian hospitals: Invasive Fungal Infection, which is used to detect patients at increased risk of fungal infections, as well as the Massive Transfusion Protocol app to identify when such is needed in trauma patients. The MTP app has been further adapted for use in Role 1 / 2 care settings and is undergoing external validations in partnership with ARA and MTEC. Potential cost savings (2018 internal business case analysis) through the use of seven of our CDSTs is estimated at $10B annually for the US healthcare system, and $110M annually for the US military health system.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs includes USUHS Department of Surgery student engagement and the generation and dissemination of knowledge products throughout the civilian and medical communities. Recruitment to date is approximately 3,300 patients; 7,600 laboratory samples, and 62 million data points. Portfolio 3: The Center for Rehabilitation Sciences Research (CRSR) supports clinical and translational research efforts dedicated to enhancing the rehabilitative care of the wounded warrior, particularly those with orthopedic trauma, amputation and neurological injury. Research focus areas include: 1) Identifying and mitigating barriers to successful rehabilitation, return to duty and community reintegration; 2) Improved pain management to support active participation in rehabilitation; 3) Applying Advanced Technologies to augment rehabilitation methods and outcomes assessments; 4) Developing and testing advanced technologies to restore individual functional independence; 5) Regenerative Rehabilitation translational products for war-related trauma. Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) are the largest source of disability in the military and affect 800,000 Service Members annually, accounting for 25 million days of limited duty. Most concerning, the disability discharge rate for MSKI has increased 13x between 1981 and 2005 (70 vs. 950 per 100,000 persons), and these trends have continued to increase in the Department of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs Administration in the most recent decade. The Defense Health Agency recognized this unmet clinical/operational gap and funded the formation of the Musculoskeletal Injury Rehabilitation Research for Operational Readiness (MIRROR) organization in 2019. In the past three years since our inception, MIRROR has established a world-class infrastructure (data, regulatory, governance) that is compliant with the DoD for conducting research, expanded the number of studies from 14 to 40, formed partnerships with 24 military and academic centers, received $65 million in grant funding, hosted 5 educational symposiums, generated 19 Post-Operative Rehabilitation Protocols to standardized care across the Tri-Service, and published 82 abstracts and peer-reviewed publications. Since then, our enrollment across all studies is approximately 5,100 subjects. Moving forward, we plan to execute on our current projects and continue to provide value through: (1) research and operational support to new military treatment facilities, (2) closing critical care injury/pain gaps (e.g., spine, knee, ankle, shoulder), (3) evaluating novel imaging modalities (e.g., elastography), (4) performing sub analyses to understand gender disparities, predisposition to injury, response to treatments, etc. MIRROR was also selected to host a 3-hour session at MHSRS 2022. The Photomedicine to Enhance Military Readiness program is a four-year, $22 million initiative with the Wellman Institute, The Geneva Foundation, HJF, and Spaulding Rehabilitation that supports JPCs 5, 6 and 8. These teams are executing 15 clinical and translational research projects to deliver optimal dosimetry of photobiological therapy to enhance performance, reduce the potential for MSKI, assist with nerve graft healing, enhance Volume 1 - 155PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 94 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA / Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 509 / Innovative Technologies for Improved Medical Diagnoses, Rehabilitation and Warfighter Readiness (USUHS) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs etc. Projects are progressing and in various stages of device development, benchtop research, and regulatory review [Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for clinical trials and Institutional Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval for animal research]. In addition to these clinical and translational research projects, CRSR continues to provide leadership and coordination of the Military Treatment Facility Engagement Committee (MTFEC) within the Pain Management Collaboratory (PMC) Coordinating Center (PMC3), which is an $81 million inter-agency initiative to support a multi-component research effort focused on non-pharmacological approaches for pain management supporting JPCs 6 and 8. Four ongoing pragmatic trials studying non-pharmacological approaches to pain for military service members and veterans continue, expanding to one additional performance site. A one-hour session at MHSRS 2022 titled, 'Novel Interventions for Non-pharmacological Pain Management,' was moderated by DoD representative and MTFEC member, Dr. Henry Nothnagel. To continue conversations among VA, DoD, and DHA members, a cross-collaboration working group has been established to discuss policies and procedures to enhance clinical research execution within the DoD. CRSR has been a leader in the 30-institution NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium, which includes the Service Academy Longitudinal TBI Outcomes Study (SALTOS). To date, recruitment totals over 53,000 participants, including more than 23,000 Service Academy cadets and midshipmen, with just over 6,700 recorded concussions, making this the largest study of its kind on the natural history and neurobiology of concussion. Thus far in FY22, 15 manuscripts have been published and 23 presentations have been completed to disseminate important findings from this cohort. Additional funding has been secured, totaling $42.65 million for the longitudinal continuation study, CARE-SALTOS Integrated (CSI). Stand-up of CSI, which will follow cadets, midshipmen, and NCAA athletes post-graduation to determine intermediate and long-term impacts of concussion on health and military service, is currently underway at five military sites, and over 500 military participants have completed Tier 1 of CSI. FY 2023 Plans: TTW PSTD: A TTW-funded project at Boston University exploring the use of mucoadhesive intranasal Ketamine particles for the treatment of PTSD demonstrated efficacy of a new polysaccharide biomaterial that has potential to overcome the limitations of low-dose ketamine. The TTW program will fund a follow-on project to be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Caroline Browne at USUHS to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and anti-nociceptive effects of these ketamine-loaded synthetic particles in Volume 1 - 156PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 95 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA / Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 509 / Innovative Technologies for Improved Medical Diagnoses, Rehabilitation and Warfighter Readiness (USUHS) B.

This preclinical work will aid in further development and validation of a safe, noninvasive, prolonged-release intranasal vehicle for the delivery of Ketamine as a treatment for PTSD. Photo-biomodulation for Pain Control (follow-on): As outlined above, the TTW program is providing additional funding for Dr. Anders's photo-biomodulation technology previously developed under TTW using Micro Needle Array (MNA) technology to build and validate a prototype battery-powered pain blocking device in an in-vivo large animal model. SC2i FY2023 Plans: WounDx Clinical Decision Support Tool (CDST): Improve clinical outcomes and cost savings by addressing unmet clinical needs for the timing of wound closure. This research will be completed through the processes of obtaining an Investigational Device Exemption and conducting an FDA clinical trial, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the WounDx CDST. Elevate military readiness by returning wounded warriors to the battlefield, and reducing the cognitive burden of surgeons responding to multi-domain operations. Minimize loss of life and limb in deployed field hospitals and definitive care facilities; minimize battle casualty morbidity and mortality. This project supplements the SC2i mission of improved clinical outcomes at lower costs, through creating clinical decision support tools that focus clinicians on the best choices for each patient. Annual SC2i Core funding supports the initiation of this research; we are seeking funding to extend our research through an IDE/FDA trial, making our tool ready for use in both military and civilian institutions. Implementation will continue for our Sepsis prediction CDST (AISE/AIDEx) integration into one or two military health facilities. A pilot study will be initiated. Will continue to work with DHA to develop best clinical workflow and perform model retraining for specific MTFs involved in the pilot. Our Massive Transfusion protocol will continue to be tested in our Consortium partner hospitals (Duke and Emory), with the goal of deploying the tool into the military health system. Continue supporting education and research initiatives with USUHS UME and GME students, as well as clinical researchers across the DoD. CRSR FY2023 Plans: FY23 award executed with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and funds received September 2022 for additional POM funding to support the continuation of CRSR.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DoD Cancer Moonshot 2 (CM2) is a mission assigned by the DoD to USUHS Murtha Cancer Center Research Program (MCCRP) as a mandate from the White House's federal Cancer Moonshot part 2 (CM2) that was initiated in February 2022. CM2 is the next generation of the original federal cancer moonshot program initiated in 2016, for which the MCCRP is actively engaged in ongoing cancer studies. The DoD CM2 program is a new initiative with new translational research projects but can and will leverage the findings and capabilities that MCCRP has developed from the cancer moonshot 2016 program. In CM2, MCCRP will leverage DoD's unique and additional capabilities to contribute to advancement of the seven priority areas of CM2 as designated by the White House. The MCCRP's three new initiatives under the CM2 for DoD include: 1) Cancer Research and Clinical Trial Network; 2) Data Analytics (Integrated and pan-omic) and Molecular Cancer Epidemiology; and 3) DoD Serum Repository Projects surrounding environmental and toxin exposures in service members. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Description: There are three new research areas developed for this new Project under the Cancer Moonshot 2 (CM2) for DoD through USUHS MCCRP: 1) Cancer Research and Clinical Trial Network; 2) Data Analytics and Molecular Cancer Epidemiology; and 3) Environmental Exposures and Toxins in Military / DoD Serum Repository Projects. These three new initiatives will address the federal government / White House's seven stated goals for Cancer Moonshot 2 which are: to diagnose cancer sooner; to prevent cancer; to address inequities; to target the right treatments to the right patients; to speed progress against the most deadly and rare cancers including childhood cancers; to support patients, caregivers, and survivors; and to learn from all patients. Under these seven new pillars for CM2, the two overall goals per the White House for Cancer Moonshot 2 is to decrease the cancer death rate from cancer by 50% over the next 25 years, and to improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer. Our DoD Cancer Moonshot 2 initiatives are specifically developed and precisely aligned to address the overall CM2 seven pillars and two goals within the DoD health care system along with our federal partners. MCCRP focus of these projects is for active duty, veterans, and beneficiaries at risk for or with cancer.

MCCRP focus of these projects is for active duty, veterans, and beneficiaries at risk for or with cancer. However, the initiatives and findings will have impact for the nation as part of the larger national Cancer Moonshot 2. There are three new projects under the Cancer Moonshot 2 (CM2) for DoD through USUHS MCCRP: 1) Cancer Research and Clinical Trial Network; 2) Data Analytics (Integrated and pan-omic) and Molecular Cancer Epidemiology; and 3) DoD Serum Repository and Tissue/Data Projects surrounding environmental and toxin exposures in service members. The base plans for each of the three are as follows: 1) Cancer Research and Clinical Trial Network: Herein referred to as \"the Network\", this is the foundational element of CM2 as it provides the link between the research protocols, studies, clinical trials, and the patients who need equitable access to them. It is axiomatic that the best treatment for cancer patients is a clinical trial. Despite knowing that, less than 10% of all cancer patients are enrolled in a clinical trial and there are known inequities with regards to lack of diversity in clinical trial enrollment across the nation. While MCCRP has done some limited engagement in this area across the DoD and other federal hospitals for our active duty, retirees, veterans, and beneficiaries with cancer, this Task #1 will enable the full build-out, completed development, and actualization of the vast potential of the DoD health care system and its hospitals as well as partner federal facilities into a fully functional and integrated military / veterans cancer clinical trials and research network. MCCRP will fully enable, staff, and support the network at DHA / DoD hospitals/medical centers and VHA facilities as well as partner sites and will enable and support the implementation and running of cancer research Volume 1 - 161PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 100 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 511 / Cancer Moonshot Initiatives B. trials across the network that have significance and relevance to the specific needs of the active duty and veteran populations with a focus on Readiness preservation. 2) Data Analytics (Integrated and pan-omic) and Molecular Cancer Epidemiology: Herein referred to as \"Data\", this project element of CM2 is needed in order to maximize the existing and to-be-developed multiple and disparate data streams that have been or are being developed from both CM1 and CM2 research and translational studies. Additionally, the CM2 Data project will enable the storage (cloud-based; on-site servers; other requirements) of the huge data files that have been, are being, and will be developed as part of all CM activities past, present, and future. Furthermore, the CM2 Data project will develop through partnerships and in-house development, the capability to utilize Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and other types of novel \"big data\" analytic tools in order to maximize the knowledge gained from the large and disparate data sets that our DoD CM1 and CM2 research projects have created and are creating. These large \"big data\" sets are exemplified but not limited to complex proteogenomic data, other multi-omics (eg. lipidomics, metabolomics, methylation, circulating DNA, others), clinical data, outcomes data of all types, tumor registry data, DHA / DoD / MCCRP datasets, radiomics data, patient reported outcomes data, and all other developed or existing data sets of any relevant type. Murtha DoD CM2 Data project will also ingest and incorporate for analysis any and all relevant intramural and extramural data sets of any and all types both existing and under development when available. 3) DoD Serum Repository and Tissue/Data Projects surrounding environmental and toxin exposures in service members: Herein referred to and subsequently identified as \"PROMETHEUS\", PROject for Military Exposures and Toxin History Evaluation in US servicemembers, is a unique first-in-class research project that takes any and all available relevant biospecimens, data, exposure history, and expertise both intramural and extramural to operationalize robust molecularly-based inquiries into the complex questions and issues surrounding the putative roles of environmental exposures, toxin exposures, and military-specific job requirements into the risk for and development of cancers or pre-cancerous conditions in active duty service members, retired service members, and veteran service members. PROMETHEUS will be intended to develop predictive capabilities, associations, and causality knowledge to allow for \"Forethinker\" predictive-in-advance abilities of what types of the above exposures and toxins may be mitigated, controlled, or avoided in order to better preserve the Readiness of the Total Force. This project will utilize and ingest any and all available DoD- and VA-level data sets (eg. other), liquid and solid and tumors to include from the AFHSD's DoD Serum Repository, MCCRP biobanks, and any other DoD-funded or available biospecimens and data sets. PROMETHEUS will partner with government and non-government experts in this field to ensure development of best-in-class research utilizing these unique, vast data and biospecimen sets across multiple molecular analytic labs and processes both governmental and non-governmental (to include Volume 1 - 162PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development Defense Health AgencyUNCLASSIFIED UNCLASSIFIED Page 101 of 101 R-1 Line #5Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 0130 / 2R-1 Program PE 0603115DHA Medical Technology Dev elopmentProject (Number/Name) 511 / Cancer Moonshot Initiatives B. not limited to civilian, university, and corporate molecular capabilities). The intake will include substrate on exposures, toxins, environment, blood, serum, tissues, and other data, and the outputs will include molecular and biologic pathways, correlations and causations, mechanisms, knowledge, and prevention opportunities.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was established in the Defense Health Program (DHP), Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation during FY 2001, and is funded in the year of execution. The objective of the DHA SBIR Program includes stimulating technological innovation, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research and development results. The program funds small business proposals chosen to enhance military medical research and information technology research. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program was established in the Defense Health Program (DHP), Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation during FY 2015, and is funded in the year of execution. The STTR Program, although modeled substantially on the SBIR Program, is a separate program and is separately financed. Central to the program is expansion of the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. The unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the small business to formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II. STTR's most important role is to bridge the gap between performance of basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations. The mission of the STTR program is to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds in critical American priorities to build a strong national economy. The program's goals are to stimulate technological innovation, foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions, and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal research and development.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) is a program that expands funding opportunities in the federal innovation research and development arena. Central to the program is expansion of the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. The unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the small business to formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II. STTR's most important role is to bridge the gap between performance of basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations. The program funds small business proposals that partner with a research institution, are technically meritorious, and enhance Joint Program Committee (JPC) research and development efforts. The DHA STTR Program can participate in any of the three (FY.A, FY.B, and FY.C) Department of Defense (DoD) STTR BAAs as well as Out-of-Cycle BAAs (FY.D). The process begins with a call for topics to the JPCs. DHA STTR topics are submitted directly to US Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) and then forwarded to the JPCs for review and internal ranking. Topic Authors brief their topics at a Topic Review Meeting attended by the DHA STTR Program Director (PD) and personnel from the supporting USAMRDC offices. Approved DHA STTR topics are published in the DoD STTR BAA. Small businesses submit proposals against topics which are then evaluated by a Technical Evaluation Team (TET) made up of a Team Chief and Technical Evaluators. TETs recommend proposals for selection. All recommended proposals are reviewed by the JPCs and the DHA STTR PD. Phase I proposal selections are announced and contract negotiations begin. Phase I contracts are awarded up to $250K for 6 months. Follow-on Phase II projects can be awarded up to $1.1M for 24 months. This process ensures the STTR program addresses the multi-agency science and technology priorities. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ (STTR) Program Description: STTR Program offers funding opportunities in federal research and development to small businesses. The program aims to stimulate technological innovation in DoD research and development, strengthen the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increase the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results.
