Others may not feel comfortable using the word until after their treatment ends. Others may prefer to use a different word. Your loved ones may not use the word \"survivor\" (or another word) in the same way as you do. If that's the case, feel free to ask them to use the language you prefer. The different feelings people have about using the term \"survivor\" are all valid.\"In cancer, survivorship focuses on the health and well-being of a person with cancer from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. This includes the physical, mental, emotional, social, and financial effects of cancer that begin at diagnosis and continue through treatment and beyond. The survivorship experience also includes issues related to follow-up care (including regular health and wellness checkups), late effects of treatment, cancer recurrence, second cancers, and quality of life. Family members, friends, and caregivers are also considered part of the survivorship experience.\" - The National Cancer Institute (NCI), www.cancer.govSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 2Welcome Being diagnosed with cancer is like being sent on a journey that you did not want to take. You are forced to go to places you did not want to go to, learn a language you never planned on learning, and do things you never wanted to do. You will have questions and concerns along the way. Navigating this foreign landscape and coping with the unpredictable demands of day-to-day life that come with the territory can be overwhelming. Remember you are not alone. The support of loved ones and organizations, such as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), can help you to navigate new pathways and help you find your \"new normal.\" Young Adults As a young adult (YA) with cancer, you are not alone. According to The National Cancer Institute, about 89,000 young people ages 15 to 39 are diagnosed with cancer each year in the United States. As a YA cancer patient, you will likely face challenges specific to your age-group. How to Use this Workbook Use this workbook to collect all the important information you need as you move through diagnosis and treatment into long-term management of a chronic blood cancer or finish treatment and begin post-treatment survivorship care. Make it personal. Part of the information you will need for long-term management of a blood cancer or survivorship will come from resources such as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) and your healthcare team. A good deal of important Visit www.LLS.org/YoungAdults for more resources and information. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 3information will also come from the time you take to reflect on your personal experience as a cancer survivor. Take this workbook with you to appointments. Fill out the worksheets with help from members of your healthcare team, as needed. When you meet with new healthcare providers, share the information with them. For some patients with a blood cancer diagnosis, there may never be a clear-cut time when treatment ends, but the information, worksheets and questions in this workbook still apply. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society also offers two other versions of this workbook: A Workbook for Adults and A Workbook for Parents, Children and Adolescents.

Please visit www.LLS.org/PublicationFeedback.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 4Advocating for Your Care Knowing how to navigate the healthcare system and advocate for your care is an important skill for young adult cancer survivors. To be successful: Learn about your cancer diagnosis and treatment options, including clinical trials. Visit www.LLS.org/DiseaseInformation to find information about your cancer type. Be aware that some young adult leukemia patients may benefit most from a pediatric treatment regimen. Ask if your cancer center has a young adult program. Don't be afraid to seek a second opinion, especially from a cancer center with a young adult program. Understand your health insurance plan and how to file an appeal if a claim is denied. Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Cancer and Your Finances for information on insurance policies and how to file an appeal. Follow your treatment plan. Do not miss appointments. Be sure to take medications exactly as your doctor prescribes them. Ask how you can access your patient portal. Many hospitals and treatment centers now offer digital \"patient portals\" where you can view your medical record and upcoming appointments, message your providers, view and pay bills, and more online. Always ask questions. Do not be afraid to ask your doctor to slow down or explain things another way. Visit www.LLS.org/WhatToAsk for lists of questions to ask members of your healthcare team. Do not withhold information about your medical history SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 5or lifestyle from your healthcare team. If important or relevant information is withheld, you may not receive the best care. Tell your doctor about any new or worsening side effects or any other concerns you may have. You can download the free LLS Health ManagerTM mobile app to help you manage your health by tracking side effects, medication, food and hydration, questions for your doctor, and more. Visit www.LLS.org/HealthManager for more information. Ask for a referral to supportive (palliative) care. Supportive care is appropriate for anyone who has a serious illness regardless of age, stage or prognosis. There are ways that can help you to manage side effects so you are more comfortable, both during and after cancer treatment. Ask for a referral to a mental health professional. Mental health is important to overall well-being. Talk to your healthcare team about any concerns you have that are related to work, school or finances. Resources may be available. Seek help from loved ones. Let your caregiver know when you do and do not need their help, and tell them what tasks they can help you with and how. Set boundaries early. See Defining Your Caregiver's Role on page 64. Create an advance directive. Advance directives are your instructions about future medical care in the event that you are no longer able to speak for yourself. When a person becomes a legal adult, they can complete an advance directive that specifies the type of care they want to receive in case of a medical emergency. See Advance Care Planning and Estate Planning on page 86. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l a Survivorship Care PlanSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 7Survivorship Care Plan A survivorship care plan is a record of your cancer diagnosis, a treatment summary, including supportive (palliative) care, and a plan for follow-up care. Ask members of your healthcare team for a written survivorship care plan. If you received treatment as a child, you can request a copy of your medical records from your treatment center. You can use the information provided in that plan to fill out this section of the workbook and/or save a copy in the pocket of this section. Record your diagnosis and all of your treatment information in the following pages. Knowing your exact diagnosis and treatment, including specific drugs and/or site of radiation, is very important information. It helps you and the members of your healthcare team develop a plan for follow-up care and the future.Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Communicating with Your Healthcare Team: Survivorship for a checklist of what your survivorship care plan can include and a list of questions to ask your healthcare team.

Your healthcare team will order frequent blood tests to monitor your blood cell counts, both during and after treatment. Blood cancers and treatment for blood cancers can affect blood cell counts in a number of different ways. Anemia (a low number of red blood cells) o Red blood cells contain hemoglobin which carries oxygen around the body. Anemia can make you look pale, feel weak and tired, and become short of breath. Thrombocytopenia (a low number of platelets) o Platelets help form blood clots to stop or slow bleeding. Thrombocytopenia can cause excessive bleeding and bruising. Neutropenia (a low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) o White blood cells help the body fight infection. A low number of neutrophils increases the risk of infection. Keep track of your lab reports to share with all your medical providers. You can keep printed copies in the pocket of this section. You may also be able to access your lab reports online through a patient portal provided by your hospital or treatment center. Ask your healthcare team how to access your reports.

However, some treatments may cause significant long-term and/or late effects. Follow-up medical care to monitor survivors for possible long-term and/or late effects is important. You should discuss the possible effects of treatment with your healthcare providers in order to plan treatment and follow-up care. The factors that determine the risk of long-term and/or late effects include: Type of treatment o For example, the specific drugs used or the part of the body treated with radiation Length of treatment Your age at the time of treatment Your sex Overall health \"Long-term effects\" of cancer therapy are medical problems that last for months or years after treatment ends. Fertility (the ability to become pregnant or father a child) problems and treatment-related fatigue are examples of long-term effects. \"Late effects\" are medical problems that do not show up until years after treatment ends. Treatment-related cancer and heart disease are examples of late effects.Keep a record of any cognitive, physical or emotional signs and/or symptoms that you experience and discuss them with your healthcare team. You can keep notes in a journal or notebook.

These effects are sometimes referred to as \"chemo brain\" or \"brain fog.\" Many cancer patients experience cognitive effects to some degree. For most people, cognitive effects last only a short time and improve after treatment ends. Other people, however, may have long-term cognitive changes. Physical Effects Depending on the type and duration of treatment, age and overall health, cancer patients may be at risk for: Fatigue Neuropathy (nerve damage) Heart issues Thyroid problems Organ damage (lungs, kidneys) Bone issues, such as osteoporosis Fertility problems Visit www.LLS.org/booklets (filter by Side Effect Management) to view Side-Effect Management: Memory and Concentration Problems in Adults.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 30 Secondary cancer Other conditions Fertility Preservation \"Fertility\" describes the ability to conceive a biological child. Some cancer treatments affect fertility in males and females. The risk of infertility is based on several factors including the type of treatment received, the duration or dosage of treatment and the patient's age at the start of treatment. There are options to preserve fertility. Some of these options require that action be taken before treatment begins. Options to preserve fertility depend on several factors. If patients need treatment immediately, there may not be time to complete the fertility preservation process. For males, sperm banking may be an option. For females, egg or embryo (egg fertilized with sperm) freezing may be an option. Other more experimental options may also be available. Or, you may be able to take steps during treatment that will reduce the chance of infertility, such as using shields during radiation therapy or choosing different treatment options, if available. Fertility Preservation Information Provide details of any fertility preservation procedures so that you can refer to them in the future. Procedure Date Hospital or ClinicPhone NumberSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 31Remember, there are many ways to build a family, whether through natural conception, using assisted reproductive technology, or adoption. When you are ready to start a family, you can consider and discuss all options with your healthcare team. Psychological Effects Psychological effects after a cancer diagnosis are common. Diagnosing yourself or someone else may be tempting, but your best resource will be a trained mental health professional who will be able to make an accurate diagnosis and create an effective treatment plan for you. The following lists some symptoms of common mental health diagnoses. If you experience any of these, speak to a mental health professional. Depression or symptoms of depression o Depression as a mental health disorder includes ongoing sad moods and/or loss of interest in activities. Often these symptoms are accompanied by other physical changes in sleep, fatigue and eating habits. Even if you do not meet the full criteria for depressive disorder, you may still benefit from therapy with a mental health professional. Anxiety disorders o Anxiety disorders include multiple diagnoses such as generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or panic disorder. Anxiety disorders are different from the common worries encountered in day-to-day life. Symptoms of anxiety disorder can include intrusive thoughts and make it difficult to pull yourself away from a persistent anxious state of mind.To learn more about the process of fertility, visit www.LLS.org/YoungAdults or visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Fertility and Cancer.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 32 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) o Post-traumatic stress disorder can develop in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary or dangerous event (such as being diagnosed with cancer). Symptoms can include anxiety, nightmares, irritability, changes in mood, and frightening and/or intrusive thoughts. Going to the hospital or being faced with foods that were eaten often during treatment are the sorts of things that may trigger these feelings. Your mental health is very important to your overall health and well-being. Ask your healthcare team or health insurance provider for a referral to a mental health professional. It is common to start taking medications that can improve your mental health. You can also visit www.helpstartshere.org and click \"Find a Social Worker\" for resources and information to help you search for local mental health professionals or to get online counseling.

Integrative medicine combines standard medicine (such as chemotherapy) with safe and effective complementary therapies. Some examples of complementary therapies include acupuncture, meditation, therapeutic massage, and yoga. Consult with your healthcare team before you try any complementary therapy to make sure it will not interfere with your treatment or medications. Ask your healthcare team if your cancer center has a complementary therapies program. Medical Marijuana. Marijuana has been used in herbal remedies for centuries. The biologically active components in marijuana are called \"cannabinoids.\" The two best studied components are the chemicals delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Under federal law, marijuana cannot legally be prescribed, possessed, or sold. Under many state laws, the use of marijuana to treat some medical conditions is legal. Under some state laws, the use of recreational marijuana by adults is legal. (Even in these states, its use is still illegal for minors.) In cancer care, medical marijuana is sometimes used to manage side effects, such as nausea, appetite loss, pain or anxiety, if other medications or treatments are unsuccessful. More research is needed to better understand the benefits and risks of marijuana and its cannabinoids. Do not use marijuana or products made with cannabinoids without first talking to your healthcare team. Marijuana or related products (for example, CBD oils) could interfere with other medications. Marijuana products that are not obtained from licensed dispensaries carry additional risks as they may Visit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies Facts.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 41contain unknown ingredients, including infectious agents. Talk honestly with members of the healthcare team about your use of marijuana or related products. Educating Family Members and Friends About Long-Term and Late Effects Once you finish cancer treatment, enter a watch-and-wait protocol, or become more comfortable managing the effects of living with a chronic blood cancer, your family and friends may assume that you will immediately feel the way you did before your cancer diagnosis. You may need to explain that even though you may seem okay you are still recovering or adjusting physically and/or emotionally. I am still below to plan what you will say to explain these feelings to family members and friends.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 42This affects me in the following ways: Example: Sometimes I do not have the energy to do all the things I need or want to by: Example: Picking up my grocery order for me and understanding when I may not feel up for family game Recommendations SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 45Healthy Behavior Recommendations Developing healthy lifestyle habits are important for cancer survivors. Healthy lifestyle habits can help you recover faster and decrease the risk of disease, such as other cancers, heart disease and diabetes. Making changes so that you can be healthier can also help you gain a sense of control throughout survivorship. Many things may be out of your control, but you can still take good care of yourself. I eat a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, proteins, whole grains and healthy fats. I drink at least eight 8-oz glasses of water or liquids (not including caffeinated drinks, such as coffee, or drinks with added sugars) each day. I sleep well each night and wake up feeling rested. o Most adults need at least 7 to 8 hours of rest each night. I exercise regularly. I do not smoke or use tobacco. I drink alcohol not at all or only in moderation. If I am not of legal drinking age, I do not consume alcohol. o Limit consumption to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. One drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor. o If you are taking any medications, ask your doctor if it is okay for you to drink alcohol. It is not safe to drink alcohol with some medications. Check all the healthy behavior statements that are true for you.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 46 I protect myself from sun damage. o Avoid direct sun, when possible, and wear broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher and reapply every 2 hours. I keep up with my medical needs, such as getting annual checkups with my primary care provider and getting regular dental cleanings. I keep my hematologist-oncologist informed about any changes in my well-being. I take all medications as prescribed. I talk to my healthcare team about my mental health. I practice self-care and do things to manage stress. o See Creating a Self-Care Plan on page 57. I connect with others (people I love, friends, family members and/or members of a support group) regularly. o Isolation is a risk factor for depression and anxiety disorder. Many young adult cancer patients struggle with feeling isolated. See Community Resources and Networking on page 94 for ways to connect with others. Did you leave any of these statements unchecked? If so, you may need to consider working on those aspects of your lifestyle. Discuss healthy behaviors with your primary care provider. LLS Community.

(Do not make changes to your diet or exercise plan without first talking to your healthcare provider.) _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ Other Disease Screenings As part of a healthy lifestyle, in addition to screening for cancer relapse and the long-term and late effects of treatment, you will need to be screened for other diseases that may be unrelated to your cancer diagnosis. Everyone needs to be checked for diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease and other cancers. The specific screening recommendations for you will depend on your age, sex and medical history. Most diseases are easier to treat or manage if discovered early. Many disease screening tests can be part of your annual wellness exam. Your primary care provider can help coordinate any tests you will need. Diseases commonly screened for include: Some types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, cervical, prostateVisit www.LLS.org/booklets to view Healthy Behaviors and Nutrition Handbook for more information. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 48 High blood pressure and high cholesterol levels (risk factors for heart disease) Diabetes Osteoporosis (weak bones) STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) Mental health conditions, such as depression Talk to your primary care provider about the disease screenings you need and how often you need them. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most insurance plans to cover preventative services at no cost. Other Disease Screening Recommendations Disease Screening Recommendation Visit www.health.gov/myhealthfinder to use MyHealthfinder to get disease screening and vaccine recommendations based on your age and sex. The MyHealthfinder recommendations come from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Discuss these recommendations with your primary care provider.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 49Immunizations Immunizations help the body build resistance to a specific disease. Ask your primary care provider which immunizations you need. You likely received many immunizations as a child. However, other immunizations are given annually or need periodic boosters of vaccines to remain effective. You may also need new immunizations, depending on your medical history. Some cancer treatments, such as stem cell transplantation, can deplete or remove the protection that a previous immunization provided.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 50Immunization Record Vaccine Date(s) GivenComments/ Reactions Flu (influenza) Tdap or Td (tetanus, diphtheria, Hib (haemophilus influenzae type b) COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) * Vaccines noted with an asterisk are not recommended for patients who have a weakened immune system. If the patient received these vaccines before the cancer diagnosis, there is no harm done.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 51People undergoing cancer treatment should receive the flu shot that is made with the dead virus. Patients must not get the nasal spray vaccine because it contains the live virus and can be dangerous for immunosuppressed patients. People who are receiving cancer treatment and require the shingles (zoster) vaccine should receive the recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix), not the zoster vaccine live. If you plan to travel outside of the United States, check the recommended vaccines for that location. You may need additional immunizations. Always clear travel with your healthcare team. Discuss the COVID-19 vaccine with your healthcare team. Ask about the latest recommendations and availability in your area.

SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l a Mental Health SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 53Mental Health Mental health, like physical health, is important to your overall well-being. Even years after diagnosis or treatment, some people continue to struggle with feelings of sadness, anxiety, grief or guilt. Some people experience \"survivor's guilt\" especially if a close friend or family member passed away from cancer. Others fear that their cancer may come back or get worse. Some feel a sense of loss or grief for their life before the cancer diagnosis. Having these feelings is normal; however, negative feelings shouldn't be interfering with your daily life. Talk to members of your healthcare team about your mental health concerns. You may benefit from the support of a medical health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, or, in some cases, medication to help with depression and anxiety. Fear of Relapse Many people who have been diagnosed with cancer fear their cancer coming back or getting worse. For some, these fears surface or become worse around the anniversary of their diagnosis or transplant date. For others, these fears surface or become worse around checkups and screenings. Some cancer survivors call this \"scanxiety.\" These fears are normal, and there are things you can do to manage them.

Do movies or TV shows that address cancer upset you? Don't watch them. Does the sight of the sweatshirt you wore on treatment days bother you? Throw it out or donate it to a clothing bank. Do you get especially anxious around scan days? Ask a friend to video chat with you. Do you feel calmer after a good walk? Do you feel more energized after connecting with a group of friends? Is your perspective different after a good night's sleep? Identify the objects, activities, specific foods, or situations that trigger negative feelings so you may feel more confident about your ability to care for yourself. What triggers your fear of relapse? Example: Anniversary date of diagnosis _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________To begin to understand what helps you feel less stressed, answer the questions below.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 56Think of ways to avoid these triggers.

How to Create a Self-Care Plan Self-care comes in many different forms. It's easy to say you want to take more time for yourself, but it can be hard to actually find the time. You will have to set goals and consciously make the time for self-care. Complete the following activities to create a self-care plan:SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 58Mental and Emotional Self-Care Taking care of your mental and emotional health is just as important as caring for your physical health. It's important to take time for yourself each day and spend it doing activities that you enjoy. Make a conscious effort to care for your own mental and emotional health. What activities do you enjoy? Check all that apply. Listening to music, playing an instrument or singing Reading or listening to audiobooks Exercising or participating in group exercise classes Playing sports or organized games with friends Hiking, fishing or participating in other outdoor spots Meditating or practicing yoga Painting, drawing or other artistic pursuits Journaling or creative writing Attending religious or spiritual services Spending time with family members or friends Practicing personal care, such as taking long baths, having manicures or using face masks Cooking or baking Watching TV or movies Playing video or computer games Yard work or gardening Other _______________________________________SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 59Any of these activities can be part of a self-care plan. Pick one or two of your favorite activities and make taking the time for them a priority in your day-to-day life. I will set aside time to _______________________________ once a day. Examples: spend time outside, read a devotional passage, meditate and stretch, write in my journal I will set aside time to _______________________________ once a week. Examples: talk to friends, attend a religious or spiritual service, go to an art class Change the activity and frequency to accommodate your lifestyle and needs, but do make sure you are making time for yourself. Physical Self-Care Taking care of your physical well-being is also an important part of self-care. See Healthy Behavior Recommendations on page 44 for more information. Body Image and Self-Esteem Almost every person struggles with body image and self-esteem at some point, but cancer survivors may face unique challenges. Cancer treatment can cause changes to the body such as hair loss, weight loss or weight gain, and skin changes. Many cancer survivors struggle with these side effects. Other cancer survivors don't experience them so people around them may assume that they aren't \"really sick.\" There is no one way a cancer survivor should look. It's normal to feel differently about your body after a cancer diagnosis, whether or not there are visible changes. It takes time to get to know your body after cancer and having patience with the process can be hard. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 60Write down some important things your body can do. Example: My arms can hug the people I love. My hands can cook a good meal. _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ Write down some things you like about yourself. Examples: my sense of humor, my smile. _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ Here are some other things you can do to feel more comfortable in your own skin. Wear clothes that are comfortable. Don't worry about the number on the tag. Wear the size that feels the best on your body. The following exercises may help you begin to understand yourself in new ways. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 61 Avoid looking at images online and in magazines that make you feel badly about your body or appearance. Treat your body well by adopting healthy habits. See Healthy Behavior Recommendations on page 44. Move your body. Go for a walk, do chair exercises or some other form of gentle movement. Watch for negative self-talk (thinking or saying negative things about yourself). We are often our own harshest critics. Next time you have a negative thought about yourself, ask yourself, \"Would I say or think this sort of thing about someone I love?\" Talk to yourself in the same way you would talk to someone you love. If some of your family members or friends talk about appearance or body size around you, ask them not to. Almost everyone is self-conscious about his or her appearance and talking about it frequently only adds to those feelings. There are much more interesting things to talk about! Remember, you don't have to love everything about your body, but you do need to respect and care for it. Ask members of your healthcare team for a referral to a therapist or counselor who can help you work on your self-esteem. Look Good Feel Better is a program that teaches beauty techniques to people with cancer to help them manage the appearance-related side effects of cancer treatment. The program includes lessons on skin and nail care, cosmetics, wigs and turbans, accessories and styling. Visit www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org for more information. You can also ask your healthcare team about local programs for hats, wigs, or other services. Or, call an LLS Information Specialist at (800) 955-4572. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 62Managing Depression It is normal to feel sad, depressed, or anxious even many years after a cancer diagnosis. However, if these feelings start interfering with your daily activities, talk to your doctor and seek counseling from a mental health professional. Symptoms of clinical depression include: Ongoing sadness or feelings of hopelessness Loss of interest or pleasure in most activities Major weight loss or weight gain Agitation or restlessness Fatigue or no energy Trouble sleeping Trouble focusing, remembering, or making decisions Feeling worthless, guilty, or helpless Thoughts of death or suicide Don't be afraid to seek help. For a referral to a mental health professional, reach out to your doctor or call your insurance provider for recommendations. You can also visit www.helpstartshere.org and click \"Find a Social Worker\" for resources and information to help you search for local mental health professionals or to get online counseling. If you are having trouble coping, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-TALK / (800) 273-8255 to talk to a community crisis center representative. The Lifeline is free, confidential and always available.Even if you do not have symptoms of clinical depression or anxiety, you can still benefit from talking to a mental health professional. They will provide you with tools for identifying your emotions and help you to learn ways to cope with them.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l a Your Family and Support SystemSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 64Your Family and Support System During your cancer treatment, one or more of the people in your life will be likely to step into the caregiver role. This person may be your significant other, a parent, another relative or a close friend. Your caregiver may go with you to appointments or perhaps stay with you during treatments, assist with daily chores and errands, help prepare food, offer emotional support, and help with other tasks as needed. Tasks, easily accomplished before cancer, may not be as doable now. Or, you may not have the energy or strength to complete tasks as your body recovers. See Educating Family Members and Friends About Long-Term and Late Effects on page 41. As a young adult, the loss of independence that may come with cancer treatment can be very frustrating. You may have only recently left your family home or begun to build your own life. If your parents become your primary caregivers, this sense of frustration can be especially strong. If your spouse is your primary caregiver, your spouse may need to help more with daily chores or childcare. These changes may be difficult for you both, as you likely view your relationship as an equal partnership. Remember, your caregiver cares about you. If you feel yourself becoming frustrated with your caregiver, try not to lash out in anger. Instead try to talk with your caregiver openly about your feelings. Defining Your Caregiver's Role What will your caregiver's role include? You may find it helpful to set some parameters and boundaries early on. Try not to assume that your caregiver will know what you need or want from them. Here are some questions you can work through together.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 65Do you wish to share all your medical information with your caregiver? Yes No Other If you answer \"Yes\" to this question, you will need to sign paperwork at the treatment center to give the healthcare team permission to communicate with your caregiver.

Parenting Most parents struggle to fit everything into their family's schedule, even without the demands of cancer and cancer treatment. It's important to accept that you may not have the time nor the energy to do everything. Be realistic about what you can and cannot do. Here are some tips to help you juggle parenting and cancer treatment. Work with your co-parent. If you have a co-parent, discuss how parenting responsibilities may need to shift during your treatment. Recognize that added responsibilities may lead to feelings of frustration. It helps to talk openly about each other's limitations and brainstorm possible solutions. If you do not have a co-parent, reach out to close friends and family members for ongoing help. Talk to your children about your diagnosis. You may worry about what to say or what not to say. You may even wish to protect children by not telling them about the cancer diagnosis. However, children are very perceptive. Even young children may be able to tell that something is wrong. Children will use their imagination and fill in the gaps of information. Explain to younger children that they cannot \"catch\" cancer and no one did anything wrong to cause the cancer. Giving your children honest information from the start will lead to feelings of trust, control and involvement. Maintain a normal schedule for your child. Children crave structure in their environment. Ask family members and Visit www.LLS.org/parenting to view Age-Appropriate Discussion Guidelines.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 69friends for help. If your child's schedule needs to change, let your child know in advance. Ask for help and accept help when offered. Friends and loved ones will likely want to help you, but they may not know how. Make a list of specific tasks you know you'll need help with. These tasks may include picking up your children from activities, walking the dog, grocery shopping, or making meals. When someone offers to help, choose a task from your list that is a good fit for that person. For example, allow a classmate's parent to drive your child to school each day. Task Helper Notes Example: Drive children to school in the morningsJenniferJennifer isn't available Fridays Keep in mind your child's mental health. If your child begins to demonstrate unusual behavior, such as angry outbursts, nightmares, or poor grades in school, talk to your child's pediatrician. You can also ask for a referral to a family counselor. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l a Dating, Relationships, Intimacy and Sex SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 71Dating, Relationships, Intimacy and Sex Dating Dating can be intimidating no matter what your situation. Remember, every date probably did not go perfectly before your diagnosis. You may have bad dates after your diagnosis as well. You may also meet incredible new people. If you feel well enough during treatment, you don't have to stop dating. If the side effects of treatment are too much, you may not feel up for it. You may want to take time for yourself to heal. It is your choice. Do not feel pressured to date if you are not interested or not feeling up to it. However, do not let cancer stop you from dating if you feel like you are ready to meet new people. Telling a Date About Your Diagnosis When and how you tell someone about your cancer diagnosis is your choice. Some people prefer to tell a date about their diagnosis right away to clear the air, so they will be able to see whether or not the person will be supportive. Other people prefer to wait until they get to know a person, feel comfortable in the relationship and sense that they can trust them. Take some time. Think about which approach is most comfortable for you. There is no perfect time to tell someone about a cancer diagnosis. If your date reacts negatively, it is not your fault. People have different histories with cancer. In some cases, you may be able to teach this person what it means to be living with a cancer diagnosis. In other cases, you may have to move on.

For example, would you want your partner to provide emotional support and/or attend appointments with you? _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________Answer the questions below to think through disclosing your diagnosis. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 73Your Significant Other If you are in an established relationship, even a new one, your diagnosis may reveal both positive and negative aspects of your relationship and your partner. Coping with a cancer diagnosis can be difficult for everyone affected by it. People react to cancer differently. Your partner may be supportive and end up being your best caregiver. Your partner may have a difficult time coping. Either way, your relationship will probably change. If you hit a rough patch, it may be beneficial for you and your partner to attend couples counseling. Look to your healthcare team, support group, or place of worship for resources and recommendations. If your partner will be your primary caregiver, set expectations in advance. See Defining Your Caregiver's Role on page 64. Cancer treatment often brings up fertility issues. Y ou will need to consider plans about parenthood. If you have a life partner, discussing these issues is important because you may want to make these decisions together. See Fertility Preservation on page 30. Sex and Intimacy Cancer treatment may affect your sexuality and the way you feel about your body. Potential sexual side effects of cancer treatment include: Erectile dysfunction Vaginal dryness Pain during intercourse Lack of desire Difficulty reaching climax Fertility problems (See Fertility Preservation on page 30.) SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 74You may be self-conscious about physical changes to your body such as hair loss, weight changes, swelling, scars or the presence of a central line or port. Fatigue, nausea, pain or other side effects may interfere with your desire for sex. Here are some of the most important things to keep in mind: Ask your doctor if it is safe for you to have sex. o For example, your doctor may advise that you abstain from sex if your white blood cell or platelet counts are low. During treatment, your doctor may recommend abstaining from sex for 48 hours after chemotherapy because the drugs can be in bodily fluids. Speak to your healthcare team about sexual changes. There are treatments and therapies available to alleviate sexual side effects. Ask for a referral to a sex therapist. Be open with your partner about any changes, especially if something hurts or is uncomfortable. Always use protection to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). o Pregnancy during cancer treatment is usually not safe for either the pregnant person or the child. If you suspect you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare team. o Use condoms or another barrier method, to protect against STDs. Oral contraception (birth control pills) and implants (for example, an intrauterine device [IUD]) do not protect against STDs. The decision to have sex or be intimate with someone is completely your decision. It may not be safe, comfortable, or enjoyable for you to have sex during cancer treatment. If this is the case, rethink intimacy and find new ways for you and your partner to be intimate such as writing love notes, massages or light touching, or simply spending time alone together.SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 75NOTESVisit www.LLS.org/sexuality or www.LLS.org/booklets to Intimacy Facts. SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 76NOTESSURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l a Planning for the Future SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 78Planning for the Future When you were first diagnosed, you may have found it difficult to think about the future. Many aspects of your life may have felt uncertain. Now that you've completed cancer treatment or become more comfortable with long-term management of a chronic illness, you may be ready to start thinking about the future again. You may also need to come to terms with a future that looks different now than the future you envisioned before you were diagnosed with cancer. It can be difficult to accept the impact of your cancer diagnosis on your future goals and aspirations. You may not have been able to pursue career goals after your diagnosis. Relationships with loved ones, family members, friends, and colleagues may have changed too. You are likely to encounter problems you hadn't anticipated. For example, you may be facing fertility issues that affect the plans you had for a family. (See Long-Term and Late Effects on page 27.) You may feel a sense of grief for your old life. This is a common feeling among cancer survivors. Take the time you need to grieve, and then begin to look toward the future. You may still be able to accomplish many of the goals you had before your diagnosis or, now, you may have set new goals for yourself. Setting Priorities When you are planning for the future, take some time to consider your priorities. What are your goals for the future? Are there specific things you want to achieve or activities you would like to enjoy more? Think about what matters most to you and order your priorities accordingly. Dedicate more time to your top priorities and allocate less time to others\u2014 especially if they don't support your goals. Setting priorities or goals helps you to focus your time and energy on the things that matter most. However, don't let SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 79setting priorities become an additional source of stress or anxiety. You can revisit your goals and priorities and change them at any time. Use the following exercise to help you think through your priorities. In the list below, circle your top 10 priorities or goals for the future.

Visit www.LLS.org/EmploymentRights to learn more about employment discrimination laws and how to enforce your legal rights. At this link, you can also find tips for the job application process. When returning to work after a cancer diagnosis, be patient with yourself. If you are looking for a new job, it may take time to find one that is a good fit. If you are returning to an existing job, you may find it takes some time to get back up to speed and to work at your pre-diagnosis capacity. Cancer and Careers https://www.cancerandcareers.org/ Cancer and Careers empowers and educates people with cancer to thrive in their workplace, by providing expert advice, interactive tools and educational events. The organization also offers a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 review service (https://www.cancerandcareers.org/resume_reviews/new) and a comprehensive database of helpful resources. Education While going through cancer treatment, you may have taken a medical leave from a college, university or vocational program. Or, you may be interested in applying to a new college, graduate school or vocational program. Here are some things SURVIVORSHIP WORKBOOK l 83to keep in mind: Online classes may be a good option for you if you are still recovering from cancer treatment or managing side effects such as fatigue. You may be eligible for accommodations under The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). However, cancer is not always considered a disability. The ADA may include accommodations such as due date extensions or additional time for taking exams. Talk to your school or program's administration for more information. You may be eligible for scholarships. To help cancer survivors offset the cost of education, scholarships and grants are sometimes available. Visit www.LLS.org/scholarships to view a list of potential scholarships. Family Planning and Fertility \"Fertility\" describes the ability to conceive a biological child. Some cancers and some cancer treatments affect fertility in males and females.
