The secondary objectives are: - to identify the risk factors of COVID-19 vaccine oral side effects in the short term. - to evaluate the relationship between oral side effects and other inflammatory side effects of COVID-19 vaccine in the short term. The target population is healthcare workers as they are identified among the priority groups of COVID-19 vaccine deployment plans in the EU/EEA and the UK. One more reason to select the healthcare workers among different groups of the population, their higher awareness about the possible vaccine-related oral side-effects so that more accurate and reliable results can be obtained. A self-administered questionnaire will be developed, and its content validity will be tested using a panel of experts. The test re-test reliability of the questionnaire will be tested by 30 volunteers (10 Czech, 10 Turkish, 10 German) to achieve at least a Cronbach's alpha of 0.70. The questionnaire will be available in five languages; Czech, English, German, Slovak and Turkish. Dual forward translation and expert panels will produce equivalent Czech, German, Slovak and Turkish versions of the questionnaire. The questionnaire will be composed of multiple-choice items divided into four main categories; a) demographic data including gender, age, location of practice, profession, and experience, b) medical anamnesis including medical comorbidities, medications, and recent oral symptoms, c) COVID-19 related anamnesis including vaccination date, previous infection, and exposure to infected cases, and d) vaccine side effects including inflammatory symptoms, cutaneous symptoms, and oral symptoms.
