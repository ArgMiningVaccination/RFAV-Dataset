Oller notes, \"During the ritual, people can visualize what they are letting go of and how that supports them achieving their goals. Many folks journal afterward or have screen-free time to aid in vivid dreaming.\" Stardust notes that sometimes, she personally enjoys releasing any negative thoughts or bad habits she has during that particular moment. You can incorporate tools to help deepen the experience Stardust herself is a fan of taking an Epson salt bath, complete with rose quartz or amethyst crystals to add \"self-love and self-care\" to the experience, plus candles, soft music, and moon water. \"In order to make moon water,\" Stardust says, \"You can take a container of regular tap water and place it under the full moon's glow. This gives the water a lot of potency and energy, which can help in healing the body. Epson salt is also great for cleansing and relaxing the body mind and spirit.\" If you're into harnessing the power of crystals, you can also charge your crystals by letting them take a \"bath\" of sorts in the full moon, and soak up all of its lovely moonlight. Then, place them back in your space or wear them as jewelry.
