While there is not yet an accepted definition of TK at the international level, it can be said that: - TK in a general sense embraces the content of knowledge itself as well as [traditional cultural expressions](/tk/en/folklore/), including distinctive signs and symbols associated with TK. - TK in the narrow sense refers to knowledge as such, in particular the knowledge resulting from intellectual activity in a traditional context, and includes know-how, practices, skills, and innovations. Traditional knowledge can be found in a wide variety of contexts, including: agricultural, scientific, technical, ecological and medicinal knowledge as well as biodiversity-related knowledge. Traditional knowledge and intellectual property Innovations based on TK may benefit from [patent](/patents/en/), [trademark](/trademarks/), and [geographical indication](/geo_indications/) protection, or be protected as a trade secret or confidential information. However, traditional knowledge as such - knowledge that has ancient roots and is often oral - is not protected by conventional [intellectual property](/about-ip/en/) (IP) systems. While the policy issues concerning TK are broad and diverse, the IP issues break down into two key themes: Defensive protection Defensive protection refers to a set of strategies to ensure that third parties do not gain illegitimate or unfounded IP rights over TK. These measures include the amendment of WIPO-administered patent systems (the [International Patent Classification](/classifications/ipc/en/index.html) system and the [Patent Cooperation Treaty Minimum Documentation](/meetings/en/doc_details.jsp?doc_id=37709)). Some countries and communities are also developing [TK databases](/tk/en/resources/db_registry.html) that may be used as evidence of prior art to defeat a claim to a patent on such TK. WIPO has developed a [toolkit](/tk/en/resources/tkdocumentation.html) to provide practical assistance to TK holders on documenting TK. Positive protection Two aspects of positive protection of TK by IP rights are being explored: - Preventing unauthorized use, and - Active exploitation of TK by the originating community itself. Negotiations on an international legal instrument are taking place within the [WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore](/tk/en/igc/). In some countries, [sui generis legislation](/tk/en/databases/tklaws/) has been developed specifically to address the positive protection of TK. In addition, providers and users may also enter into contractual agreements and/or use existing IP systems of protection. "}
