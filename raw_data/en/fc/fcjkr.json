Such retrograde colonization of preexisting benign glands by cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a distinct pattern of cancer cell spread and is seen in many solid tumors, including prostate and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Welcome to the Human Biology Annual Retreat! This past year The Human Biology Division has c ontinue d its tradition of serving as the home base for a remarkable group of researchers with diverse interests in cancer research and other complex human diseases. Together we are a complimentary blend of fundamental, applied, and translational research ers. We have accomplished a lot since our last retreat. We welcomed new primary and secondary members, promoted members , were awarded many new grants and initiated new collaborations. We hosted six speakers through our two programs Human Biology Distinguished Speakers and Trends in H uman Biology . Our first round of professional development funds to HB Staff Scientists, Post Docs and techs were awarded. We also enjoyed celebrat ing together at our annual pumpkin carving, holiday parties, ice cream social and summer picnic. Our recruitment efforts have been successful in finding talented new faculty. Last spring, we welcomed Susan Bullman, Ph.D. as an Assistant Member. Susan studies the sp ecies of bacteria that is implicated in colorectal cancer. This summer, Michael Haffner M.D. Ph.D. joined us as an Assistant Member in the Prostate Cancer Program . Our faculty have been recognized with many notable honors . This is a wonderful testament to our research excellence and the outstanding caliber of our faculty. To name just a few, Denise Galloway , Ph.D. was elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences , Daphne Ph.D. received an NCI MERIT Award. The Human Biology division aims to continue the tradition of scientific excellence at Fred Hutch through active mentoring of our students and fellows .

Due to the major advancement in sequencing technologies and the expansion of the field of epigenetics, exploiting viruses to investigate chromatin biology has enormous potential. Our goal is to advance basic understanding of viral manipulation of chromatin and uncov er new aspects of chromatin biology. Much like the cellular genome , viral genomes must be compacted in virus particles with small basic molecules to maximize space and be poised for gene expression . Some DNA viruses use cellular histone proteins tocompact their genomes whereas others use Adenoviruses encode their ownhistone -like protein , called protein VII, that forms a 'beadson a string ' assembly with the viral genome . By examining protein VII in host chromatin , we discovered that protein VII sequesters the immune danger signal , HMGB 1, in chromatin thereby dampening downstream inflammation (Avgousti et al, Nature 2016) . This discovery sets the framework for deciphering how adenovirus manipulates host chromatin and more broadly how DNA viruses use histones or histone -like proteins for dual function: to compact their genomes and control host genomes. Research efforts in t he lab use a multidisciplinary approach to address the following questions: 1.How does adenovirus protein V II impact nuclear architecture ? The expression of protein VII in cells is sufficient to increase nuclear size and markedly disrupt the appearance of c ellular chromatin. To investigate this phenotype, we carried out immunoprecipitation of protein VII followed by mass Daphne Avgousti , Ph.D. spectrometry (IP -MS) conjunction with chromatin fractionation proteomics, we have identified chroma tin factor HMGB1 as well as linker histone H1 as potential key players in the chromatin distortion caused by protein VII. Projects in the lab will use cell culture, microscopy, biochemistry and genomic techniques to asses this phenotype and define the role of host chromatin factors in viral pathogenesis. a.To which genomic sites does protein VII bind? What is the effect on transcription? b.How do host chromatin factors, such as HMGB1, contribute to protein VII's impact on host chromatin? 2.How doe s herpes simple x virus (HSV -1) affect host chromatin ? HSV-1 is an enveloped DNA virus with well characterized lytic and latent stages. HSV -1 first replicates in epithelial cells then enters peripheral neurons where it establishes latency. We developed a novel proteomic a pproach for temporal analysis of the host and viral proteome, phosphoproteome and chromatin al, MCP 2017) . These data reveal that hundreds of host proteins are regulated during lytic H SV-1 infection, including many chromatin factors. We also uncovered dynamic changes in histone post -translational modifications throughout the course of HSV -1 infection. In addition to mining this vast dataset, projects in the lab will use molecular biolog y and genome editing techniques to investigate chromatin -related proteins and their role during HSV -1 is upregulated during HSV -1 infection and localizes to viral genomes. What is the role of macroH2A during infection? b.Chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF are also upregulated late during infection. What is the function of these complexes during infection?

Trevor Bedford , Ph.D. Associate Member Vaccine & Infectious Disease Division and Computational Biology Program Associate Member, Human Biology Ph.D., Harvard U niversity B.A., University of Chicago My research program focuses on phylodynamic analysis of pathogen sequence data with an intent of making inferences that are actionable to public health. This research program spans a number of viral systems including seasonal and avian influenza, Ebola, Zi ka, SIV, MERS -CoV, dengue and mumps. This requires development of mathematical and statistical methods to integrate infectious disease sequence data into evolutionary and epidemiological models. I've co -developed the open -source Nextstrain platform (nextstrain.org) that aims to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data by providing a continually -updated view of publicly available data alongside powerful analytic and visualization tools. This platform is used by the W orld Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to aid in vaccine strain selection for seasonal influenza virus. This platform was also highlighted during the Zika epidemic in the Americas and the Ebola epidemic in West A frica as a central source for data sharing and up -to-date insights. I have published over 50 scientific journal articles and my awards include a MIRA R35 investigator award from NIGMS, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award and the NIH / HHMI / Wellcome Trust Op en Science Prize.

The underlying genetic fingerprint of each cancer is different and the presence of specific mutations, e.g. EGFR activating mutations in lung cancer, ca n dramatically influence the response of tumors to specific therapies. The goal of my laboratory is to enable precision medicine by systematically uncovering the molecular alterations in cancer , determining the function of these variant alleles, and under standing how these alleles modulate response to cancer therapies. Although many of the genes involved in cancer have now been identified, a major challenge is discovering which specific alleles of these genes are involved and how these alleles modulate therapeutic response. My group uses functional genomics, computational biology, biochemistry, and genetics to understand the mechanism of somatic cancer variants. Our goal is to identify drug targ ets and biomarkers and to translate this knowledge into clinical benefit for patients. A central theme in the laboratory is understanding the mechanism and therapeutic targeting of cancer oncogenes in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Both KRAS and RIT1 encode small GTPase proteins and are mutated in lung adenocarcinoma and in the germline of \"Ras -opathy\" patients. Although KRAS has been extensively studied , RIT1 mutations wer e discovered <5 years ago and the role of these mutations in cancer is poorly understood. We are using unbiased proteomic approaches and genome -wide CRISPR knockout screens to determine the functional similarities and differences between KRAS and RIT1 , with the goal o f identifying critical effectors of these proteins that might be targeted for the rapeutic benefit. Candidate drugs will be tested in a genetically -engineered mouse model generated by our lab.

Our goal is to identify genes and gene pathways that can be us ed as novel targets in cancer therapy, with a particular focus on regulators of the balance between stem cell renewal and differentiation. We use mouse skin epidermis and epidermal squamous cell carci noma (SCC) as models of tissue growth in development and disease. The skin epidermis is particularly suited for our investigations for the following reasons: A.It is a well-defined physiological s ystem: The by a basement membrane. Epidermal growth during the embryonic development and its maintena nce in the adult are ach ieved through continuous cycles of progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation under the co ntrol of cell extrinsic signals from the surrounding mesenchyme. B.It has implications to human health: SCC of the skin is the second most common ca ncer in people, with an estimated 700,000 new cases in the US each year. Fortunately, most lesions are detected early and surgically removed, accounting for the disease's high survival rate. Importantly, ontogeny of epidermal SCC parallels cancers with much higher mortality rates, including the SCC of the head and neck, and the lung SCC. C. There are mature tools for analysis of gene function: In addition to established methods of creating transgenic animals, we have shown that mouse ep idermis can be efficiently and stably targeted through in *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Slobodan Beronja, PhD utero injection of lentivirus. Using lentiviral vectors for RNA i-mediated gene knockdown or gene overexpress ion, we can rapidly assess gene function and comp lex genetic interactions in vivo. Research efforts in the lab are divided between several a pproach es: 1.Candidate-based analysis of gene function in regulation of epidermal tissue growth. We have completed an RNA i screen of ~16,000 mouse genes and u ncovered putative regulators of epidermal tissue growth during em bryonic development and oncogenic hyperplasia. We are now testing the precise ce llular and molecular mechanisms behind the observed gro wth effects, with a focus on genes that specifically operate within the physiological e nvironment by altering the balance be tween stem cell renewal and differentiation. 2. Large -scale investigation of modifiers of epidermal tumor initiation. We have successfully comb ined pooled-format, lentiviral-mediated RNA i and quantitative Illumina sequencing in a rapid, comp rehensive, and relatively low-cost approach to genome-wide gene function ana lysis during embryogenesis. We have now extended the use of this approach to identify bona fide enhancers of tumor initiation and p rogress ion in the oncogenic Ras animal model postnatally. The complexity of our lentiviral pools vary from patient-specific to genome-wide. 3.Development of a general model of epithelial growth and tumorigenesis. Our technique of injecting lentivirus in utero can be modified to produce efficient transduction of other tissues, including the oral, mammary and airway epithelium. These are distinct from the skin in their organization, physiological environment, and rate of developmental and regenerative growth, and carcinomas in these epithelia are the leading ca use of tumor-associated deaths worldwide. Using RNA i-mediated gene knockdown, we test the general applicability of molecular mechanisms uncovered in our s tudies of epidermal growth and tumorigenesis.

To this end, we pursue a broad -based methodological approach to elucidate the fundamental and clinical implications of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mutations in the pathogenesis of cancer and age -related d isease. The majority of our projects set out to address long -standing intractable questions in mutation research, which have remained unanswered, largely due to technical limitations. Thus, our first step toward their resolution typically involves the dev elopment of new methods and technologies (featured examples highlighted below) to sensitively measure biological information. The application of these tools to the question at hand, more often than not, reveals new insights into biology that exceed the sco pe of the hypothesis being tested, driving us down new and exciting pathways of discovery in pursuit of our overarching mission. As such, while mutagenesis remains at the core of our research program, the focus of the laboratory continues to diversify and expand. Current and ongoing areas of interest include nuclear and mitochondrial genomics, DNA repair, transcriptomics, metabolomics, single cell biology, tumor immunology, cancer therapeutics and diagnostics.

We combine molecular microbiology, computational biology, biochemistry, and genetics to understand host-microbial interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Through such efforts, we seek to make discoveries that have both a scientific and clinical impact in the emerging area of bacteri al-associated malignancies. Bacterial agents that have a role in cancer initiation or progression provide a viable route for prevention and treatment of these cancers. We have a particular interest in the colorectal cancer associated bacterium, Fusobacteri um nucleatum . Utilizing state -of-the-art functional and computational approaches, we aim to improve the understanding of processes that contribute to Fusobacterium -associated cancer, its contribution to the tumor microenvironment and accelerate the develop ment of new targeted therapeutics or personalized approaches that take in to account the tumor microbiota for cancer treatment. Our current projects touch on two broad areas, noted below.

Clinically, the presence of circulating tumor cell clusters is associated with significantly worse patient outcomes in a variety of cancer types. Our laboratory's major focus is to decipher the fundamental mechanisms explaining this phenomenon. Which cell types cooperatively promote collective metastasis? What signals enable tumor cell clusters to survive and proliferate? How do clustered tumor cells coordinate their actions? To answer these questions, we use cutting edge tumor organoid, time-lapse microsco py, and single cell technologies to directly observe and manipulate tumor cell clusters . O ur ultimate mission is to guide the innovation of new therapies for metastatic breast cancer patients. Our research efforts are divided among three areas: Molecular regulation of collective invasion Tumors frequently invade collectively as clusters of cells into surrounding tissues, but the molecular phenotype of the cancer cells leading this process have remained unclear. Using organoid assays, we found that the molecular phenotype of invasive leader cells was distinct from the bulk tumor cells and conserved across breast cancer subtypes. We have now identified the molecular profiles of leader and non-leader cells, and are testing the function of specific genes in regulating their invasive behavior and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Kevin Cheung, MD Mechanisms for cluster -mediated survival Our recent studies establish the importance of a metastatic route involving the dissemination of tumor cell clusters. We have developed lineage tracing and microscopy platforms to track tumor cell clusters from their origin to distant sites. Our data reveal that tumor cell clusters have superior colonization relative to single tumor cells independent of their propensity to form emboli in vivo. We are now dissecting the molecular basis for these remarkable properties. Dissect ing intercellular signaling interactions in tumor cell clusters A fundamental question is how collective cell behaviors emerge from the interactions of distinct cell types. Our studies have identified subpopulations of cells within tumor cell clusters wit h distinct molecular profiles and cell behaviors.

This research has led to fundamental discoveries about how cell division and protein ubiquitylation are regulated in normal cells, and their associations with cancer. Our approach has been to employ whatever methods are needed to make mechanistic and physiologic advances, and these methods have included biochemistry, cell biology, proteomics, and gene targeting in human cells and mice. As a result, our work has often revealed surprising findings in well -studied pathways. We have had a particularly sustained impact in studies on the Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase, which sits at the crossroads of our expertise in cell division, the mediation of protein degradation by the ubiquitin system, and tumorigenesis. We are moving our basic and mechanistic work towards therapeutic goals whenever possible. Current Studies: Fbw7 Tumor Suppressor - d Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component o f an SCF -ubiquitin ligase that targets a remarkable group of proteins for degradation by the proteasome. Many Fbw7 substrates are critical oncoproteins, and Fbw7 is one of the most frequently mutated human tumor suppressor genes. Our lab has made numerous key contributions to understanding this complex pathway. One area involves our discovery of new substrates, including Myc, Notch, cyclin E, and Mediator, and their mechanisms of degradation. Another area has entailed the use of physiologic human and mouse gene targeting models to understand the normal and neoplastic functions of the various Fbw7 isoforms. Recently, we described the fundamental importance of bclurman@fredhutch.org https://research.fhcrc.org/clurman/en/projects.html Bruce Clurman, MD, PhD Fbw7 dimerization its substrate interactions, and how dimerization may explain Fbw7's unusual muta tional spectrum in cancer and lead to novel therapeutic strategies. Finally, we have developed new mouse models of Fbw7 -associated cancer, including a new model of metastatic and chromosomally unstable colon cancer. Cyclin E regulation and function - The cell cycle field exploded during my postdoc and early independent career, during which time a basic framework of cell division emerged, including cyclin E's central role in G0 to S-phase progression and tumorigenesis. We contributed substantially to th is field and established new paradigms in cyclin E regulation and function. One area is cyclin E -degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system, wherein we first made the surprising discovery that cyclin E autophosphorylation triggers its own ubiquitylatio n and destruction. We subsequently detailed the mechanisms through which cyclin E phosphorylations regulate its ubiquitylation by Fbw7 and establish its normal periodicity during the cell cycle. Another surprising discovery was our finding that cyclin E ha s a CDK -independent function in licensing replication origins, which was the first description of a CDK -independent cyclin function. We have also described the genomic instability caused by cyclin E deregulation in cancer and a homeostatic response that protects cells against this genomic instability. Finally, we have developed mouse models with targeted mutations of cyclin E phosphorylation sites to demonstrate the roles of phosphorylation -dependent cyclin E control in differentiation, genome stability, ce ll division, and tumorigenesis. Cip/Kip CDK inhibitors - We have made many contributions to this field that have had a sustained impact. The first was the finding that cyclin E -CDK2 inhibited p27 by targeting it for proteolysis. The idea that a CDK inhibit or could be antagonized by the very kinase it inhibits was completely unexpected. Nonetheless, these data are now widely accepted and set the stage for many future studies of CDK inhibitor regulation. Another example is our work on the ubiquitin -independen t degradation of the p21 CDK inhibitor by the proteasome. Although p21 is ubiquitylated, we found that its proteasomal degradation does not require ubiquitylation. Although controversial at the time, these data also established a new mechanistic paradigm w hich we subsequently fully characterized. We have also studied normal and neoplastic p27 functions models in novel mouse models, including a high throughput insertional mutagenesis screen, which revealed p27 -collaborating oncogenes. CDK2 functions and regu lation - One continuing aspect of our work on CDK2 has focused on identifying CDK2 substrates, which began with our studies of cyclin E autophosphorylation. We subsequently developed novel proteomic methods using substrate thiophosphorylation and ATP analo g substrate -sensitive CDKs, to discover more than a hundred new CDK2 substrates. We have now adapted this method to highly physiologic contexts, which has revealed even more new substrates, including the discovery that CDK2 regulates a host of chromatin -modifying enzymes to coordinate cell division and gene expression. In light of new therapies targeting CDK4/6, we have now adapted these methods to identify new CDK4/6 substrates. We have more recently focused on the importance of CDK2 inhibitory phosphoryla tion by Wee1, and made a cell line to show that CDK2 inhibitory phosphorylation has essential roles in cell cycle control, in DNA replication dynamics, and in genome instability. Most importantly, we found that the inability to inhibit CDK2 during stalled S -phase leads to massive DNA damage, which has formed the basis for an exciting new chemotherapy strategy.

Ohio State University, Biochemistry HIV AND THE EVO LUTIONARY HISTORY OF VIRUS-HOST INTERACTIONS The Emerman lab studies host -cell interactions of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and related viruses in order to understand the molecular and evolutionary basis of virus replication and pathogenesis. We do this by studying the evo lution and function of host antiviral genes. Our goal is to determine how HIV adapted to humans, and how ancient viral infections influenced the susceptibility or resistance of humans to modern lentiviruses. Host restriction factors are potent, widely exp ressed, intracellular blocks to viral replication that are an important component of the innate immune response to viral infection. However, viruses have evolved mechanisms of antagonizing restriction factors. Through evolutionary pressure for both host su rvival and virus emergence, an evolutionaryarms race has developed that drives continuous rounds of selection for beneficial mutations in restriction factor genes. Because viruses can evolve faster than their hosts, the modern -day vertebrate innate immune system is optimized to defend against ancient, extinct viruses, rather than our modern viral threats. Thus, we use the evolutionary history of restriction factors and their functional interactions with viral proteins to understand modern viral pathogens s uch as HIV -1. By using human polymorphisms in restriction factors as well as comparisons to other primates, we can identify \"holes\" in the human innate immune system that make us ill -adapted to infection by HIV. We are using this information combined wi th the evolution of restriction factors to create novel, more potent variants on existing antiviral proteins that we call \"super restriction factors\". We have developed a powerful new high -throughput screen for HIV restriction factors and host other host factors based on incorporation of CRISPR guide RNAs into HIV virions. We are using these screens to discover the interferon -stimulated genes that inhibit HIV, to discover human genes Michael Emerman, PhD that used for HIV for productive infection, and for uncovering pathways u sed by HIV to maintain itself in a latent state and avoid elimination by the immune system.

High -risk papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) are causative agents in nearly all cervical cancers and the majority of other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. By identifying the targets of the viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, we have revealed key regulatory pathways that control proliferation, senescence, apoptosis and DNA damage repair . These pathways are also targets of somatic mutation in other epithelial tumors. We are particularly interested in the mechanisms by which the HR-HPV E6 and E7 proteins disrupt the r epair of DNA damage. In addition to studying the mechanism we plan to exploit this vulnerability to develop therapeutic approaches to treat HPV associated neoplasia. Development of cervical ca ncer occurs over decades and the precursor intraepithelial lesions can be readily obtained. Analysis of the staged clinical lesions, coupled with ectopic express ion of E6 and E7 in otherwise normal cells, allows us to distinguish the proximal consequences of E6/E7 e xpress ion from the myriad ch anges that result from genetic instab ility. Additionally, the requirement for HPV infection and gene express ion in anogenital malignancy provides a clear target for proph ylactic and therapeutic immune intervention. A longstanding interest has been in characterizing the humeral immune response to HPV following natural infection or vaccination. We have mapped epitopes involved in virus neutralization and continue to characterize the breadth of the response. Current studies are characterizing the B cell memory response by identifying HPV-specific memory B cells, plasmablasts and the antibodies they express. These studies are important in determining the most effective vaccine regimens , whether fewer doses are effective and whether natural immune responses could be improved by vaccination. Understanding memory responses and the protective antibodies they generate will have broad implications for vaccine design. We are collaborating with others to conduct an efficacy and immunogenicity trial of a single dose of HPV vaccines in Kenya, and are also determining effective dosing regimens in HIV+ children in Peru. *considering taking a graduate student 2019-20 20 Denis e Galloway, PhD We have also bec ome interested in the role that the Merkel Cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) plays in the etiology of Merkel Cell carcinoma (MCC) , a rare but aggressive skin cancer. Interestingly we demonstrated that antibodies to the common region of large and small T antigen are present in about 60% of pati ents with MCC and that increases in antibody titer are prognostic of recurrence. We also showed that MCPyV encodes another T antigen in an alternate reading frame to large T antigen, which we named ALTO. ALTO is evolutionarily related to the middle T ant igen of rodent PyVs. A major focus is to determine the mechanisms by which the viral T antigens play in tumorigenicity and to develop suitable cell based and mouse models.

The goal of his lab is to understand how microenvironments within di stant tissues regulate dormancy, re -emergence and therapeutic resistance of disseminated tumor cel ls (DTCs). Solving these puzzle s is key to extending metastasis -free survival of cancer patients; with the ultimate goal of preventing metastasis altogether. To accomplish this goal, the LSM2 studies dormant DTCs within spontaneous metastasis models, and builds organotypic culture models to dissect how different microenvironments influence DTC fate. In addition to traditional laboratory techniques, we utilize intravit al microscopy, live cell microscopy , ribosome profiling and proteomics to gather informati on on where dormant DTCs reside within a given tissue, the cellular and molecular constituents of these resident niches, and the dynamics by which DTCs operate within these niches. Four major research directions are currently underway in the laboratory: 1.Uncovering tissue -specificity of the dormant niche : Dormant DTCs localize to microvessels regardless of where we find them, and even though the end result (i.e., quiescence) may be the same, the means to get there may differ. Specifically, it is well known that vascular beds possess very different properties depending on the tissue that they f eed. This very well could result in (and in fact reflect) very different perivascular microenvironments, with different factors that affect disseminated tumor cell behavior in each organ. To elucidate the tissue -specificity of the perivascular niche, we en gineer mimetics of microvascular beds of a number of different tissues, including those where disseminated breast tumor cells commonly emerge (e.g., brain, lung, bone marrow and liver) as well as those where they rarely do. *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020Cyrus Ghajar , PhD 2.Understanding how the periva scular niche contributes to therapeutic resistance . Breast tumor cells disseminate very early during tumor progression, and typically possess fewer genomic abnormalities than even the primary tumor. Because of this, it is unlikely that they inherently (e.g ., due to somatic mutation) resist chemotherapy. Instead, we think the perivascular niche plays a large part in this, and are actively working to profile the perivascular niche to identify unique regulators of DTC survival, growth and drug resistance. 3.Defining adaptive immune cell interactions with dormant DTCs . We are working to understand whether the adaptive immune system recognizes dormant DTCs, and whether the ability of these cells to evade killing by the adaptive immune system depends on their gr owth status or their microenvironment. 4.Devising regimens to specifically treat dormant DTCs . Our goal is to leverage the above into new therapies to treat dormant DTCs, whether that entail \"reinforcing\" the dormant niche to keep them asleep, or compro mising aspects of the niche that protect DTCs from therapy. We are also leveraging the models we have developed to screen for drugs that selectively target dormant cells. Our hope is that these approaches will lead to novel, effective therapies for dormant DTCs that ultimately prevent metastases from emerging.

Taran Gujral , Postdoc, Harvard University Ph.D., Queen's University B.Sc., Queen's University The Gujral lab is focused on understanding the molecular details of how cells respond to growth factors and how these signaling networks can be targeted therapeutically. To advance investigation of pathological signaling events among cells within the microenvironment, the Gujral lab is developing techniques for culturing organotypic slices of tumor tissue and monitoring the behavior of specific ce ll populations. Dr. Gujral discovered a pathway involving the growth factor Wnt5 and the receptor Fzd2. His lab explores how this pathway contributes to liver fibrosis and cancer metastasis by triggering changes in cell fate. The molecular networks that le t cells respond to stimuli are complex, dynamic, interconnected, and context dependent. Therefore, the Gujral lab uses systems biology and computational biology along with cell biological, genetic, and pharmacological approaches to investigate tissue -speci fic signaling networks, identify molecular targets for drug discovery, and identify new uses for existing medicines. Current Studies Wnt Signaling in Disease : Metastasis is responsible for ~90% of cancer -associated death, yet progress has been slow in developing drugs that either specifically target metastasis or target cells with metastatic potential. The process of epithelial -to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated normal embryonic development, but this process is aberrantly activated and contributes to metastatic potential in cancer. EMT is a reversible process in which epithelial cells adopt mesenchymal properties, which include changes in cell shape, proliferative capacity, and increased motility. Our lab identified the Wnt5 -Fzd2 pathway as a key signaling network driving EMT and tumor metastasis in several challenging cancers, including liver, breast, lung, and colon. This pathway is one of several g rowth factor -mediated pathways that trigger EMT in both embryonic development and normal and transformed cell lines. Our lab uses a combination of cell biological, biochemical, and genetic approaches to uncovering the signaling networks by which growth fac tors stimulate EMT, which could guide the development of new therapies directed at cancer metastasis. Developing New Technologies for Studying Signaling within a Tissue Microenvironment : A main focus of our lab is the development of new technologies that e nable investigation of cellular interactions within the tissue microenvironment. Such methods need to (i) preserve the tissue microenvironment and maintain cell - cell interactions; (ii) study the properties of individual cells within this microenvironment, (iii) expose individual Taran Gujral , PhD cells within a tissue to stimuli in a spatially and temporally controlled manner, and (iv) evaluate the response of single cells within a tissue to stimuli. We are developing new experimental approaches to study cell -cell interactio ns and single cell responses in the complex tissue microenvironment. We are developing approaches relevant to investigating cancer within the tumor tissue context, as well as approaches that will enable new insights into physiological regulation of cells w ithin normal or disease tissues. Developing Computational Tools for Performing Network Pharmacology . Another area of investigation is in the application of computational strategies to explore novel pharmacological options. Many drugs affect multiple targe ts, and many effective therapies target multiple regulators of a physiological process or multiple mediators of an intracellular signaling pathway. Network pharmacology is a new field of science focused on targeting multiple steps in a physiological regul atory network. Goals of this field include facilitating the design of drugs with specific multi -target profiles and exploiting the existing polypharmacology of many currently used medicines. We are developing computational tools for evaluating the many pot ential clinical applications of kinase inhibitors, because kinases represent a core group of enzymes involved in most cellular responses to stimuli and represent an important target for existing therapeutics for cancer, inflammation, and other disease states. Additionally, most available kinase inhibitors lack specificity, making attributing the effects of an inhibitor to an individual kinase difficult. Finally, the physiological and pathological roles of many kinases remain to be discovered. Thus, the tool s we are developing will enhance our understanding the basic biology of kinases as well as advance pharmacological exploitation of these key cellular regulators.

My laboratory 's research is focuse d on studying the role of genomic alterations in cancer and expanding applications for precision medicine. We combine research in two complementary areas: (1) We d evelop and apply novel computational methods to comprehensively profile and study cancer genom es from patient tumor s and (2) we develop approaches to use non-invasive liquid biopsies , such as circulating tumor DNA from blood , to monitor genomic changes in patients receiving therapy . Our goals are to uncover the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of treatment resistance, identify blood -based genomic biomarkers, and translate these findings and innovations to advance cancer precision medicine. We are interested in understanding the roles of tumor evolution and abnormal genome structure in cancer . We apply cutting -edge whole genome DNA sequencing technologies, particularly platforms that generate long -range genomic information , such as linked -read sequencing . These technologies enhance the reconstruction of genomic rearrangement s and enable the study of alterations in non -coding genomic regions. Our recent work applying this technology to study advanced prostate cancer includes the discoveries of non-coding alterations to an enhancer of the androgen receptor and a genome -wide tandem duplication signature associated with CDK12 -loss. A key focus of our research i s to accelerate the development of new approaches to exploit liquid biopsies for study ing cancer . We leverage insights from th e analysis of tumor genomes to inform the design of circulating tumor DNA applications to study treatment response in cancer patients . We have established strong collaborat ions with experimental and clinical scientists at Fred Hutch and UW to apply our approaches to study treatment resistance in prostate and other cancers . The development of novel computational algorithms for analyzing human cancer genomes is a primary research focus of our group. Probabilistic, machine learning algorithms that we have developed include TITAN, HMMcopy, and ichorCNA for predicting genome -wide alterations from tumor and cell -free DNA sequencing data. These software tools are widely used by the cancer research community. We are actively developing new methods to expand our suite of tools to analyze and discover new signatures in tumor and circul ating tumor DNA . *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Gavin Ha , Reed SC, Rhoades J, Polak P, Cipicchio M, Wankowicz SA, Wong A, Kamath T, Zhang Z, Gydush G, Rotem D, International PCF/SU2C Prostate Cancer Dream Team, Love JC, Getz G, Gabriel S, Zhang C -Z, Dehm SM, Nelson PS, Van Allen EM, VA, Beroukhim R, Taplin M -E, Meyerson M.

A defining feature of almost all solid tumors is that cancer cells show dramatic changes in cell shape and size compared to benign cells . Yet, we know little about the principles that govern cell shape and their alterations in cancer. Every cell has a structural scaffold, a skeleton , termed the cytoskeleton. It consists of a complex interlinked network of proteins t hat supports the cell and helps to maintain its shape. To invade other tissues, cancer cells need to alter their cytoskeletal properties to become malleable enough to change their shape and to move through tissues. However, the process es by which cancer ce lls become such \"shape shifters\" are not well understood. To explore this further, my laboratory will focus on elucidating alterations of the cytoskeleton in solid tumors with a particular focus on prostate cancer . For instance, w e have recently described a novel protein, named AIM1 that regulates cytoskeletal organization by binding to actin , a major component of the cytoskeleton . When AIM1 is present, the cells' scaffolding keeps it rigid and correct shape. When AIM1 is lost, cells can remodel their cyto skeleton more frequently , change their shape and become capable of invading and migrating to distant locations. Notably, AIM1 function is disrupted in m any solid tumors and genomic alterations of AIM1 are associated with aggressive tumor growth . The goal of these studies is to understand the mechanisms that govern changes in cell architecture to explore such cancer specific changes for therapeutic targeting . I am very interested in having a graduate stude nt join my laboratory in 2019 -2020 . *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Michael Haffner , MD, PhD SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Hughes RM, Simons BW, Khan H, Miller R, Haffner MC , Differentiation, Alters the Tumor Microenvironment, and Drives endogenous retrovirus expression, testicular germ cell tumors.

Our previous work characterized a new NE dynamic in cancer cells where the nucl ear membrane ruptures, which causes mislocalization of proteins and even organelles, and then either repairs or collapses. Remarkably, cancer cell nuclei that undergo many rounds of nucleus rupture and repair are viable, but these NE dynamics can increase genome instability, cause massive chromosome rearrangements frequently found in human tumors, and activate innate immune pathways that lead to inflammation and metastasis. However, w e are just at the beginning of redefining the NE as a dynamic structure a nd determining how defects in NE stability impact s cell function . My lab uses a combination of fluorescent microscopy, biochemistry, and genomics tools to investigate the following questions: 1) What controls NE rupture and repair in cancer cells? Our cur rent model of NE rupture , based on observations in cancer cells, in vivo migratory cells, and cells from laminopathy patients, is that disorganization of the nuclear lamina leads to areas of weak membrane that are prone to both chromatin herniation and mem brane rupture when force is applied to the nucleus. However, our understanding of why the lamina becomes disrupted and what types of forces cause instability are rudimentary. In addition, the mechanisms of NE repair are almost completely uncharacterized. T o understand these mechanisms better, we are taking a candidate approach to ask how previously characterized nuclear lamina proteins affect NE stability and a large -scale approach to identify new factors that affect nuclear lamina structure and NE membrane dynamics. Emily Hatch , MD, PhD 2) Why is the NE around micronuclei so unstable? Our previous work found that when cancer cell chromosomes missegregate and recruit their own NE at the end of mitosis, forming compartments called micronuclei, they make a highly unstable NE that is prone to rupture and collapse. We showed that NE rupture in micronuclei frequently causes significant DNA damage and subsequent work demonstrated that the fragmented chromatin can undergo massive rearrangements in the next cell cycle. Yet why micronuclei fail to assemble a stable NE and why they can't repair after rupture are still unknown. We are taking both hypothesis -driven and proteomics approaches to address this question to increase our fundamental knowledge about NE assembly mechanisms and identify new methods to prevent NE rupture in cancer cells. 3) What are the consequences of losing nucleus compartmentalization at the cellular level and how does this contribute to human disease? We currently use a cultured cell system to study the cellular mechanisms that cause NE instability. However, rapidly dividing cells in culture are likely desensitized to the compartmentalization defects associated with transient NE rupture, since mislocalized proteins and organelles can be removed during mitosis. Thus we are also developing new tools to study the consequences of NE instability, such as increased DNA damage, impairment of nuclear processes , including gene expression, impairment of cellular functions, and changes in transformation potential, in disease -relevant cell types . Our overall goal is to define causal links between NE rupture, misregulation of cellular functions, and disease phenotypes to identify potential therapeutic opportunities.

In the process, we have developed prec linical trial infrastructure and imaging that supports the development of novel therape utic approaches. My laboratory developed the RCAS /tv-a system of post-natal somatic cell- type sp ecific gene transfer to study cancer formation in mice, and used this system to model the formation of gliomas and medulloblastomas. We demonstrated that stem ce lls are more sensitive to transforming events than differentiated cells, that Akt activity is elevated in human glioblastomas, and that deletion of PTEN (as occurs in human glioblastoma) in mice was causal in glioma formation and progression. Brain tumor cells that are resistant to radiation therapy occupy the perivascular niche a nd have stem-cell characteristics driven by a combination of Akt and notch activities. We have shown that nitric oxide prod uced by endothelial ce lls promote stem-cell characteristics in perivascular cells through cGMP, PKG and Notch signaling. We have further characterized therapeutic DNA Damage Response pathway in gliomas and compared this data with that from human GBM. Finally, one recent breakthrough in the field is the molecular subdivision of the GBMs. Our contribution to this was de monstrating proteomic evidence that specific signaling pathway activity characterizes these subgroups and that the mouse models were specific mimics of the molecular GBM subgroups. The human and mouse glioma data has led to molecularly-stratified clinical trials for GBM patients. The biology of immunotherapy response in gliomas We have been using our immunocompetent models of gliomas to better understand the immunologic response to the tumor and to its response to standard therapy. Different glioma subtypes have different immun e characteristics, a feature mimicked by our mouse models. The Abscopal effect, where radiation or other localized therapy induces the body's immune system to recognize and target tumors outside the field of therapy as foreign. We have created experimen tal paradigms that have bilateral tumors of different subtypes, Eric Holland, MD, PhD or where one tumor is treated and the immunologic response measured on the other side. Ultimately, we hope to better understand when and how checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T cells and oncolytic v ectors can be used in combination with standard therapy. The bio logy of stem-ness in tumors and its consequences in gliomas in vivo One topic in this area is the issue of stem-ness in tumor cells and what drives this character. The work evolves from our previous work showing that stem like cells are located in the PVN and are driven by NO signaling mentioned in the abstract among others. Mathematical and mouse mod eling My laboratory has a long-standing collaboration with Franziska Michor of the Computational Biology department at the Dana Farber. We comb ine mathematical modeling with mouse modeling to understand the likelihood of events in the evolution of gliomas development or in optimizing therapy based on p arameters obtained from mouse models. In these projects we have: 1. identified the most probable cell of origin for PDG F-induced gliomas, 2. determined the order of genetic events in the evolution of these tumors, 3. identified the first events in gliomas formation, and identified an optimized schedule for delivery of radiation therapy based on parameters obtained from our PDGF-induced gliomas model. The bio logy of therapeutic response in gliomas Many laboratories are studying the biology of these tumors (and other tumor types), but few are trying to understand the biology of how these tumors respond to therapy. This is conceptually important because the disease that kills people in the western world is a treated and recurrent tumor, not an u ntreated tumor. Therefore, we have spent effort in developing the technologies to und erstand how these tumors respond to standard therapy using the same rigor that we have studied the biology of the tumor in the first place. MRI and bioluminescence imaging and preclinical trial drug developme nt In order to perform preclinical trials in mice, we need to identify tumors, quantify their size, and follow them over time non-invasively. One approach that we have used is by MRI scanning with T2 weighted images or with T1 weighted images with and without contrast as is done in people. However, MRI only measures anatomic structure and not biologic processes. Therefore, we have developed bioluminescence imaging strategies for use in preclinical trials of brain tumor-bearing mice. We initially developed a reporter mouse that expressed luciferase from the E2F1 promoter that measures pro liferation and a Gli responsive promoter measuring SHH signaling. We are now developing genetic backgrounds that acti vate luciferase e xpress ion by cre recombinase activity that will allow us to \"see\" the tumor cells in vivo that have been deleted for PTEN, or that have knocked d own INK4a/arf. This will allow us to easily identify mice with tumors and to count live tumor cells in vivo non-invasively. The gl ioma tumor microenvironme nt Gliomas are composed of not only tumor cells per se b ut also reactive astrocytes, microglia, endothelial ce lls and pericytes. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that many if not all of the cells that make up the stroma in these tumors contribute to the tumor biology and may be valid therapeutic targets. Novel mod els of gliomas subtypes and ependymomas We have also de veloped a modified version of the RCAS/tv-a system that achieves loss-of-function comb ined with lineage tracing using sh ort hairpins and florescent tags. This system is able to mimic the mesenchymal GBMs by comb ining knockdown the combination of NF1 and p53 while lineage tracing each of these two events from specific cell types, with a penetrance of essenti ally 100%. We are using this model to und erstand the evolution of mesenchymal GBM from prone ural ones and und erstand the complexity of these tumors. This type of lineage tracing allows us to appreciate the ce llular heterogeneity in ways that germline strategies are unable to. We also have developed a new model of ependymoma by expressing a commonly occurring gene fusion (C11orf95/RELA) with this sy stem. Eric Holland, MD, PhD PDGFR inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for aracterizes GBM and is s ufficient to induced similar tumors in mice. One might think that inhibition of PDGFR would be a good therapeutic strategy for at least the proneural GBM subgroup. However, several trials of PDGFR inhibitors have been done in humans with GBM and none h ave been succ essful. A simple explanation is that the patients were not stratified to PDGFR active tumors prior to enrolling in these trials. However, there are several additional more interesting possibilities as to why this might be the case, and we are investigating under what circumstances PDGFR inhibition might be effective. One contributing factor is likely to be cellular heterogeneity of these tumors where subc lones of cells within the tumor express PDGFR while others express EGFR in humans, and in mice similar results can be se en. A sec ond co ntributing factor in the resistance to PDGFR inhibition is the fact that most of the gene express ion ch anges that accompany the oncogenic transformation of olig2 express ing cells by PDG FR in vivo are not reversed by PDGFR inhibitors in vivo, even when that inhibition achieves a full cycle arrest. Additionally, mutant forms of PDGFR alpha found in some GBM appear to reduce effect of PDGFR inhibition. Finally, we have found that additional alterations found in human gliomas such as loss of Ink4a/arf, p53 or PTEN enhance oncogenic character of these tumors and prevent PDGFR inhibition of achieving full cell cycle arrest.

We are currently investigating the role of immune cells within the lung tumor microenvironment in a comprehensive fashion, beginning with how they have been recruited, and ending with a detailed understanding of the mechanism (s) by which a specific immune cell effector has impacted tumor growth. We have recently developed a program to personalize immune modulatory therapies for non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients. Using a combination of mouse models of lung cancer and human NSCLC specimens, we have been able to determine the exact composition of the immune response to lung cancer. Our findings show that neutrophils are the most common immune cell population pr esent in human NSCLC and inversely correlate with CD8+ cellular content and access to malignant tumor. Ongoing studies in our lab have been designed to understand the mechanistic basis of neutrophil antagonism of lymphocyte responses and to investigate the efficacy of neutrophil depletion in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Armed with this knowledge we are defining the next generation of therapeutic vulnerabilities in disorders associated with translation deregulation such as prostate cancer and bladder cancer . Dissecting the functional interface between transcription and translation in genitourinary malignancies . The process by which mRNA is translated into a protein is a highly energetic and meticulous process that is essential for life. Howev er, protein synthesis can also be usurped by cancer to drive cellular transformation, uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance (Hsieh et al. Cancer Cell 2010, Hsieh et al. Nature 2012, Hsieh et al. Science Signaling 2015). Work from our laboratory indicate that transcription factors and chromatin remodelers utilize the translation apparatus to shape the cellular proteome (Liu and Horn et al. Science Translational Medicine 2019). Interestingly, this relationship can b e co-opted to drive specific cancer behavior at a molecular, cellular, and organismal level in prostate and bladder cancer. A major focus of the lab is to understand how the translation apparatus controls cancer initiation and progression in prostate and b ladder cancer. Key questions: 1) How does the translation apparatus interface with chromatin remodelers or transcription factors in the context of genitourinary malignancies? 2) What are the key downstream translational drivers necessary for cancer phenoty pes? *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Andrew Hsieh, MD 3) How can we therapeutically disrupt oncogenic translation? Understanding mechanisms of oncogenic mRNA specific translation . mRNA specific translation is the mechanism by which distinct mRNAs are preferentially translated to control cellular phenotypes. This can be mediated through the protein synthesis apparatus or changes in mRNA sequence and structure. Our laboratory has been fascinated by the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, which are necessary for efficient protein synthesis and poss ess a plethora of somatic mutations in cancer. Surprisingly, their functionality remains poorly understood (Schuster and Hsieh Trends in Cancer 2019). Thus, we are deeply investigating how somatic alterations in the UTRs impact cancer phenotypes. Key quest ions: 1) What are the underlying cis-regulatory mechanisms that enable oncogenic mRNA specific translation? 2) How do somatic mutations to transcribed but non -coded portions of the genome impact post -transcriptional gene regulation and cancer phenotypes? 3) How can we screen for the functionality of cancer -associated somatic mutation in UTRs? Advance staged bladder cancer as a platform for biological and therapeutic discoveries . In 2015, our laboratory along with Drs. Ming Lam (UW Urology), Jonathan Wrigh Pathology) nucleated the first bladder cancer focused rapid autopsy program in the world. We have used the precious resource of late stage tumor specimens to interrogate the genomic underpinning of aggressive bladder cancer and to develop patient derive xenografts and primary cell - based models. Through this work, we have identified distinctions between upper tract urothelial carcinoma and lower tract urothelial carcinoma as well as th e potential therapeutic implications of druggable genetic lesions in patients with metastatic bladder cancer (Winters et al. JCI Insight 2019). Key questions: 1) What are the distinctions of transcriptionally defined bladder cancer subtype across tumors in a patient with metastatic bladder cancer and how do these distinctions impact outcomes? 2) How does the proteomic landscape of metastatic bladder cancer differ between unique organ sites? Advancing our understanding of mRNA specific translation through collaboration: RNA modifications and translation control in normal cell physiology . Chemical modifications to RNA such as a methylation of adenines and isomerization of uridines have been shown to impact the process of mRNA translation. Work from o ur laboratory in collaboration with the Bellodi Lab (Lund University) and the Paddison Lab (Fred Hutch) have demonstrated a central role for these types of modifications in shaping the cellular proteome. Importantly, these processes are essential for the m aintenance of normal stem cell physiology and the dynamic transitions that occur during erythrocyte differentiation (Guzzi et al. Cell 2018, Kuppers et al. bioRxiv 2018). In addition, through work with the Beronja Lab (Fred Hutch) we are unraveling the cri tical role of mRNA specific translation in cell fate choice. Andrew Hsieh, MD Key questions: 1) How do m6A modifications enable the select translation of mRNA essential for the various stages of erythrocyte differentiation? 2) How are key cell fate regulators dynamically and translationally controlled in basal epithelial cells of the skin in vivo ?

The functions of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are remarkably conserved between mice and humans and mouse models have and will continue to provide fundamen tal insights into the causes, prevention, and treatment of human cancer. More r ecently we have pivoted direction to wards more translation approaches, specifically d iscovering and developing n ovel drugs and drug targets for the treatment of cancer. Using arrayed well-based s iRNA high throughput screens, we are identifying the complement of genes that are required for survival of cancer cells but not normal cells. By combining this functional genomic data with small molecule drug screens and genomic characterization within the same cells, we arrive a t a set of prioritized targets and novel drug candidates. Because we can do this in patient derived tumor cells we can anchor results to patient treatment history thereby enhancing successful clinical translation. . To date, we have identified novel targets for head and neck cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We are collaborating with clinician scientists, computational biologists and patient advocates at a number of cancer cent ers and precision medicine initiatives to broaden and deepen this cancer drug targ et search engine. We are confident that this grass roots and cross disciplinary approach will accelerate the discovery of safer, more effective cancer treatments in the near future. PUBLICATIONS Kemp, C .J.

Although chromatin -remodeling proteins are frequently dysregulated in human cancer, little is known about how they control tumorigenesis. This question is particularly relevant given that oncogenic transformation often involves epigenetic re wiring to meet the demands of uncontrolled proliferation, survival and metastasis. An imbalance in chromatin dynamics can lead to cancer by inactivating tumor suppressors, activating oncogenes, or by reactivating pathways that inhibit differentiation or fa vor stem cell self -renewal. A challenge of the next decade will be to not only chronicle the altered expression and mutations of chromatin factors but to also define the phenotypic ramifications and the epigenetic abnormalities for each in cancer. Explori ng chromatin factor dysregulation in cancer also provides a tractable system to address a more fundamental question of how tumor cells evolve when epigenetic barriers are altered, what characteristics are selected for to enhance tumor cell growth and the p lasticity of these tumor cells in response to environmental perturbations. A more in depth study of the chromatin factors that are lost or gained during tumorigenesis and how they remodel the epigenome are likely to form the basis for innovative approache s to cancer therapy and the development of novel biomarkers. Currently, the laboratory is investigating the following questions: 1)What are the epigenetic barriers to the of pancreatic cancer?

We study the ce ll biology connecting gap junctions and intercellular communication with the co ntrol of cell growth, the cell cycle and, how the relationship is disrupted during wounding and carci nogenesis. Our interest in gap junctions as potential biomarkers of cancer a nd, more recently, the advent of new screening method ologies has expanded our efforts into broad pro teomic screens for potential ca ncer biomarkers using high dens ity antibody array technologies to discover proteomic, autoantibody and glycomic b iomarkers of cancer. We study potential biomarkers for pancreas, co lon, breast and lung ca ncer. Our colon cancer biomarkers are most advanced and are involved in industry sponsored studies hopefully heading towards regulatory approval. The lung cancer work has the best chance to have a large impact in the way existing screening programs currently fun ction. Our ongoing cell/molecular research involves the regulation of gap junction assemb ly and function. Gap junctions allow for diffusion of small molecules (<1000 MW) between ad jacent cells via matched ce ll-to-cell membrane chan nels. Vertebrate gap junctions are composed of proteins de rived from the connexin gene family. We have sho wn that gap junction formation and degradation are highly regulated via protein kinases at various stages of the assemb ly process and the ce ll cycle. The most widely expressed gap junction protein connexin43(Cx43) is regulated via phospho rylation at over a dozen sites. Current studies include determination of the cellular localization of different connexin phos phorylation events and the sp ecific serine sub strates that are phosphorylated within conn exins du ring cell division, development, skin wounding, card iac stress and carci nogenesis. Thus, we link the activation of specific kinases to phosphorylation on a particular residue within the co nnexin protein and to connexin function in tissue including ovary, eye, skin and h eart.

In our research we employ cutting -edge technologies including mouse and human prostat e epithelial transformation systems; functional genomics; multi -omic data molecule drug discovery; and immuno -oncology to develop new approaches to stratify and treat prostate cancer. The research in the lab i s divided into three main areas: 1.Functional characterization of drivers of prostate and bladder cancer: Next-generation sequencing has enabled the large -scale profiling of aberrant genetic events associated with cancer. However, functional annotation of t his rich information in relevant , genetically -defined cancer model s is limited. To address this, we use a forward genetic approach with mouse and human epithelial organoid transformation systems. Benign epithelial cells are modified to stably express speci fic oncogenic factors, cultured briefly in the permissive environment of organoid cultures , and transplanted into immune -deficient mice. The resultant tumors are characterized to gain insight into the mechanisms by which the interaction of specific oncogen ic events generate certain phenotypes of prostate and bladder cancer. 2.Immunotherapeutic targeting of prostate cancer differentiation -specific antigens: We have established a platform integrating RNA -seq and proteomics to nominate tumor -associated antigens enriched in subtypes of advanced prostate cancer with limited systemic expression in normal tissues. Candidate cell surface and intracellular antigens undergo multi -level validation including immunohistochemistry of microarrays of metastatic prostate canc ers and benign human tissues. From the validated targets, we engineer and test both humoral and cellular immunotherapies in cell line - and patient -derived xenograft models of advanced prostate cancer. *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 John Lee , MD, Ph.D. 3.Disrupting the protein stability of Myc and androgen r eceptor (AR) in advanced prostate cancer: Myc and AR are transcription factors with essential roles in the pathogenesis and maintenance of typical prostate cancer. We have developed Myc and AR reporter assays that facilitate the dynamic assessment of both subcellular protein localization and protein turnover. We are interrogating these assays with genome -wide CRISPR loss -of-function and gain to uncover the genetic/biologic pathways that modulate Myc and AR localization and stability. The se reporters have also been used to complete high -throughput, high -content imaging screens with diverse chemical libraries to identify small molecule Myc and AR protein destabilizers.

We focus on small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), a highly aggressive neuroendocrine cancer. Typically, SCLC has metastasized by the time of diagnosis, and survi val rates are dismal. We identified major driver genes mutated in human SCLC using next -generation sequencing approaches. To explore key activities of SCLC -mutated genes we use mouse genetics and functional studies. We have generated a panel of new mouse m odels of SCLC. These models, along with derived cell lines, are employed to understand how mutations in certain genes promote SCLC and to identify vulnerabilities conferred by these mutations. Genomic ana lyses and functional genomics , including genome sca le CRISPR inactivation and cDNA overexpression screens are used in these efforts. We have become particularly interested in understanding cancer -mutated genes that alter chromatin, as in general, there is a poor understanding of how such mutations drive cancer. We use mouse models to explore tumor suppressor roles for histone methyltransferases, acetyltransferases and other cancer -mutated chromatin regulating genes. Our ultimate aim is to translate an increased understanding of the basic biology of SCLC driver genes to the development of novel therapies for a cancer type greatly in need of new therapies. Working with our clinical colleagues at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, we have generate d a panel of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCLC. Both PDX and genetically engineered mouse models are used for studies that try to link mutations in key SCLC driver genes to therapy response . *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 David MacPherson, PhD SELECTED PUBLICATIONS Augert A, Eastwood E, Ibrahim AH, Wu N, Grunblatt E, F, Cheng WY, Mack F, MacPherson D.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men with more than 160,000 new cases diagnosed yearly in the US . There is a clear genetic predisposition with higher rates of aggress ive cancer in certain families. Environmental and dietary factors also co ntribute. Major technological advances in DNA sequencing now provide an opportunity to comprehensively detail every molecular change that occurs in a given tumor. This information has the potential to avoid \"one-size-fits-all\" treatments, eliminate ineffective therapy, and tailor interventions to individual tumor vulnerabilities. Areas of current work include: Developing New Therapeutic Strategies for Early and Late Stage Cancer We aim to determine the molecular features that associate with response and resistance mechanisms to pathway-targeted agents and conventional chemotherapy . Several clinical (translational) trials are underway including studies incorporating neoadjuvant therapies and large-scale tumor genome sequencing. Tissue samples are acquired pre- and post-therapy and molecular correlates of direct drug effects are identified to define tumor and host signatures: (a) predictive of therapeutic response and (b) predictive of disease outcome (relapse). Mechanism-based assessments of specific oncogenic mutations serve to focus further drug development. We are exploring new minimally -invasive approaches to assess the molecular composition of *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Pete Nelson, MD tumors using circulating tumor cells and cell -free tumor DNA biomarkers that allow for iterative sampling of tumor biolog y. Characte rization of the Cellular Androgen Receptor (AR) Program A major focus of the lab has been the identification of down-stream ''effector'' genes that are responsible for cellular events (e.g. proliferation) after androgen receptor (AR) activation. The AR is the first known example of a precision medicine target that continues to be the major focus of treatment in advanced pros tate cancer. We have identified a network of genes that are regulated by androgens in prostate ca ncer cells. Systematic studies involving the genetic and pharmacological modulation of these genes are designed to determine their cellular function with the aim of identifying those genes involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, differentiation, and treatment resistance. Genes with prostate-restricted expression ser ve as therapeutic targets for immunological and pha rmacological strategies. Determining the Role of the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) in Cancer Biology The macro and microenvironments within which malignant neoplasms arise can exert profound influences on tumor behaviors that range from a c omplete reversion of the malignant phenotype to the pro motion of tumor cell invasion and metastatic growth. In addition to tumor cells, the architecture of most solid tumors includes an assortment of non-malignant cell types derived from distinct developmental lineages that carry out structural or functional roles including fibroblasts, muscle ce lls, nerves, a nd vasculature. We have determined that components of tumor microenvironments (TME) also contribute to de novo and acquired treatment resistance. In current practice, the majority of cancer-directed therapeutics do not exclusively target malignant cells, but also injure benign cells in the local, and potentially the distant host microenvironments. Such co llateral damage is quite evident for non-specific therapies that involve DNA-damaging modalities such as genotoxic drugs and ionizing radiation. Ongoing work centers on characterizing a D NA Damage Secretory Program in the TME that is comprised of a remarkable spec trum of proteases, gro wth factors and cytokines. The composite effects of this program promote tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and also resistance to therapeutics. Cancer Predisposition. Prostate cancer is one of the most heritable malignancies: it is estimated that ~50% of prostate cancer risk is due to genetic factors. In addition to common polymorphisms that influence cancer predisposition, we have recently determined that rare highly -penetrant cancer predisposition genes are frequently mutated in men with aggressive/advanced prostate cancer. These predisposition genes link prostate cancer with other heritable cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer in the context of BRCA1/2 mutations and colon cancer in the context of mismatch repair gene mutations. Importantly, mutations in these DNA repair genes identify families at risk for cancer and support precision oncology strategies that exploit responses to specific therapeutics.

The lab seeks to understand what immune responses contribute to whether a productive infection is established and why certain viruses are selected in that process . In the case of antibody responses, much of the work is on defining the types of antibodies that are associated with protection in HIV exposed humans. The lab also studies the functional properties of these antibodies, including their ability to mediate killing of infected cells and neutralize virus. The lab has made the surprising finding that infants more rapid ly develop neutralizing antibody responses to HIV than adults and the HIV -specific antibodies have less somatic hypermutation. Efforts are underway to identify the target of these responses and t o define the evolutionary pathway that leads to their emergence of HIV antibody responses in infants. Similar stud ies are focused on individuals who are superinfected with a second strain of HIV and develop robust antibody responses. The s tudies of innat e immunity seek to defin e host cells factors that target the replication of circulating, transmitted variants of HIV. These studies include defining the interferon induced genes that respond to HIV as well as determining which of these factors restrict viral replication , particularly transmitted strains . Her laboratory has more recently begun exploring s imilar questions for Zika virus, focused on understanding if there are differences in the factors that restrict different strains of Zika. Much of the HIV research in the lab is focused on populations in Africa because this is where the AIDS epidemic is most severe. The laboratory is part of a larger team, comprising researchers in both Seattle and Kenya (The Kenya Research Project), that is studying the molecular epidemiology of HIV transmiss ion.

Functional Genomics Functional genomics is the study of the function of genes contained within an organism's genome, or, put another way, an approach to figure out what roles genes have in an organism. In the last fifteen years, two powerfu l homology -based gene targeting technologies have come along that have revolutionized functional genomics in mammals. These are RNAi and CRISPR -Cas9. The Paddison Lab routinely uses both to power studies regarding the underlying biology of human stem and progenitor s, by targeting each gene in the genome and determining their contribution to a phenotype of interest. In addition, we have leverage d the mutagenic properties of CRISPR - Cas9 to test models of the human ge nome's protein coding structure. Although the human genome is currently predicted to contain 5494 conserved protein family (Pfam) domains (e.g., methyltransferase -like domain) , most of these domains have not been validated while ~45% of protein coding regions lack Pfam domains altogether. However, b y tiling sgRNAs across protein -coding gene s we are able to identify essential Fig 1. Identifying predicted and new essential protein domains using student 2019-20 20 for our epitranscriptomics program Patrick Paddison, PhD domains and motifs in phenotypically constrained reg ions. As a result, gene s required for particular phenotypes (e.g., viability) can produce a unique mutational signature, with constrained regions scoring as phenotypic \"peaks\" (Fig. 1) . We are current ly applying this technique to >4 00 genes in the human genome spanning the epigenome, mitotic factors, and the spliceosome . Biological Focus Area s Precision oncology. The promise of \"precision oncology\" relies on decoding the molecular signatures of tumors to make predictions about effective therapies. The prevailing wisdom is that precision therapies will arise from identifying and targeting \"drivers\" of onc ogenic transformation (e.g., mutated oncogenes). However, this approach has met with limited clinical success, particularly for some of the most devastating and difficult to treat cancers. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and common for m of brain cancer in adults: approximately 90% of GBM patients die within two years of diagnosis with current standard of care therapy. We used GBM stem -like cells in combination with functional genomic screening to identify novel GBM therapeutic targets (Fig. 2 ). Epitranscriptomics. Epitranscriptomics generally pertains to chemical modifications of mRNA occurring during or after gene transcription. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is among the most frequent post -transcriptional chemical modifications found in mammalian mRNA. In cell -based models, m6A has been suggested to participate in numerous types of mRNA regulation (e.g., turnover, splicing, translation, or miRNA targeting). However, while m6A-mRNA likely exists in most if not all eukaryotes, physiologically relevant roles for m6A-mRNA have yet to be well established in mammals. Recently, in collaboration with Dr. Beverly Torok -Storb (Clinical Research Division) -Cas9 genome to identify g enes required for human erythroid (red blood cell) lineage specification. Among the novel hits were m6A mRNA regulatory machinery, with Dr. Andrew Hsieh's group (Human Biology) , we have now shown that m6A mRNA marks promote the translation of a network genes required for human erythropoiesis , including factors that control epigenetic patterning in chromatin (Fig. 3 ) (Kuppers et al., 2019) . Regulation of Ce ll Identity and Cell Growth . Cancer cells may arise from maligned development programs, hijack ing molecular pathways that are normally involved in developmental processes such as cell fate determination. The existence of cancer stem cells, which may play vital roles in tumor progression, maintenance, and recurrence, underscores this notion. One of the current projects in lab in this space is understanding how normal and cancer -causing progenitor cells enter and exit quiescent -like states. Through single cell RNA sequence analysis and functional genomic screens , we have identified classes of genes that block or promote entry into quiescent -like states. The results from these studies will better help define our notions of cell cycle regulation and maintenance of progenitor cell identity. Fig 2 . Inhibition of PHF5A causes human GBM tumor regression and survival in immune - compromised mice. PHF5A is important for 3' splice site recognition and was identified as a key GBM vulnerability driven by MYC activity.

The clinical s ignificance of these events in malignant and pre-malignant human breast tumors is of primary interest. Our involvement in collaborative research provides a un ique opportunity for translational of basic science discoveries to questions that can be posed in large, clinical a nd population-based s tudies. The current model of carcinogenesis is that of a multi-step accumu lation of genetic changes within cells that supplant normal controls on ce ll division and lead to increased cell proliferation. Abnormalities of the cell cycle in a highly proliferative cell population may then lead to add itional molecular alterations. In fact, derangements in the ce ll cycle may not only contribute to uncontrolled ce ll growth but may be ca usal factors in the development of cancer. In collaboration with epidemiologists and basic scientists, we were one of the first groups to identify the loss of cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 as an important indicator of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Follow up in a phase III Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) clinical trial showed that, in women with steroid receptor positive tumors but not in women with steroid receptor negative tumors, loss of nuclear p27 protein expression is a marker of poor prognosis for women treated with adriamycin. Recent data evaluating mislocalizat ion of p27 to the cytoplasm we found that cytoplasmic p27 contributed to lapatinib resistance in Her2+ breast cancer cells by suppressing apoptosis. Our results suggest that p27 localization may be useful as a predictive biomarker of therapeutic response i n patients with Her2+ breast cancers. Steroid receptor status is one of the main differentiating characteristics of breast cancer and lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression in tumor cells ('triple negative' breast cancer (TNBC)) is associated with a specifi c constellation of risk factors such as inherited BRCA1 mutations, high rates in African American women, aggressive tumor characteristics, poor outcome, and lack of response to hormonal treatment. In breast cancers of young AA and Caucasian women in a population -based case -control Atlanta study, we found high -frequency Peggy Porter, MD gene copy number alterations ( CNAs ) in genomic locations that were subtype -specific, and of the highest frequency in TN BC compared to the other subtypes of breast tumors, and at specific genomic sites in tumors of AA women. We are using these data to guide the evaluation of gene copy number , methylation and LOH alterations of specific genes in the genomic regions identified. Although others and we have succes sfully identified molecular markers of tumorigenesis using conventional approach es, single gene and protein changes are also un likely to reflect the comp lexity of the molecular changes present in tumor cell populations. Using global approaches, we are now in a position to elucidate the molecular component s, and the connections between the components, that coincide with the acquisiti on of malignant traits. We are cond ucting discove ry projects in diverse populations including women exposed to radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear accident and Latina women from the U.S. and Latin America . We were awarded funding from the Breast Cancer Research Foundation in 2017 to evaluate the effect of radiation on global tumor mutations, gene copy number changes, gene express ion and DNA methylation, as well as inherited genetic contributions in radiation exposed women in the Chernobyl region of Russia.

Advances that we made with these NIH grants are described below. Background. I was trained as a geneticist (PhD). Lee Hartwell and I discovered yeast cell cycle mutant s when I was an undergraduate researcher in the University of Washington Department of Genetics. This discovery led to two groundbreaking papers that became the basis for Lee's well deserved Nobel Prize. I became interested in cancer from the research of Drs. Stan Gartler and the late Phil Fialkow in the University of Washington Department of Genetics. They b oth taught me that cancer was a disease of somatic genome evolution . This concept was later articulated eloquently by the late Dr. Peter Nowell in his 1976 Science classic article. The insights of these pioneers led me to enter medical school to study cancer as an evolutionary process. The lessons of every class help guide me to a subspecialty (gastroenterology), in which endoscopy allowed access to vis ually detect and biopsy neoplastic lesions of the GI tract where genomic and evolutionary insights could be investigated to prevent or detect cancer early when it was curable. Research focus. The focus of our Fred Hutch research team and our collaborator s is Barrett's esophagus ( BE) and its evolution to esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EA). However, the vast majority of patients with BE do not Brian Reid, MD, PhD progress to EA and BE instead remain in a benign state that patients die with, not of. Conversely, EAs typically arise in individuals who were not known to have BE before presentation of an advanced, symptomatic EA. The outcomes of population screening for BE and EA have been well documented in Denmark by Hvid -Jensen et al (Figure 1) as wel l as many other investigators. This conundrum has also been documented in many other \"premalignant\" conditions and cancers , including those of the breast and prostate, as well as many other organs. NIH sponsored a \"Think Tank\" on the topic. I was a member of th is Think Tank, which resulted in two major publications: (1) \"Overdiagnosis and overtreatment in cancer: an opportunity for improvement .\" Esserman LJ, Thompson IM Jr, Reid B JAMA. 2013 Aug 28;310(8):797 -8 and (2)\"Addressing overdiagnosis cancer: a prescription for change.\" LJ, Thompson IM, Reid B, Nelson P, Ransohoff DF, Welch HG, Hwang S, Berry DA, Kinzler KW, WC, Bissell -2045(13)70598 -9. Our research on BE is designed to elucidate and control the evolution of BE and EA over time and space in the esophagus. The goals include (1) accurately distinguish ing aggressive BE that evolves rapidly to EA from benign BE that does not progress to EA o ver the lifetime of a patient and who will instead die of unrelated causes. Other goals i nclude (2) elucidation of the evolutionary mechanisms that cause some BE to rapidly progress to EA while others remain indolent . These mechanisms may also be aberrant in other \"CIN\" cancers. Finally, (3) we seek to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms tha t can render EA resistant to all known therapies, including immunotherapy. Challenges for EA control. The fundamental challenges of BE and EA include (1) complexity of the EA genome compared to the typical non-progressing BE genome, (2) the speed with wh ich this genomic complexity evolves and (3) absence of a known effective treatment for advanced EA . The complexity of the cancer genome has recently become widely appreciated through advances in DNA sequencing and genomics but there have been no major advances in treatment of advanced EAs. The clinical implications of the speed at which cancers evolve has been the subject of discussion for decades. Cancers that evolve rapidly will be harder to detect because rapid progression decreases the \"window of opportunity\" for early detection of EA (Figure 1). In this case, slowly or non -progressing BE will be easy to detect because they persist for sufficiently prolonged periods that the patient will die of competing causes of mortality before EA develops . This concept has been called \"length bias sampling\" (Figure 1) . The outcomes in BE are poor with only a small proportion of patients who benefit from currently available approaches to prevention, early detection or therapy for EA ( Figure 1) . Length -bias sampling has also been implicated in screening for Brian Reid, MD, PhD many other types of cancer, but very few studies have compared the temporal evolutionary progression to cancer with a control population of patients who do not progress to cancer. Our team has done this in BE. Some of our results have been published during the current review period and others are currently being analyzed. Although there was initial optimism that EA might respond to immunotherapy, subsequen t studies have reported that EA and many other cancers with high rates of aneuploidy and chromosome instability are resistant to current immune therapies. Our goals are to provide research advances that will improve current outcomes for prevention, early d etection and therapy of EA. We have either recently completed or are currently analyzing three large data sets . I have also participated in a number of Think Tanks and other venues to generate new concepts, ideas, initiatives and approaches to address thes e vexing challenges that characterize many cancers in addition to EA. Below I review three major studies that our team has been engaged over the past 5 years . The first two studies have been completed and published. The third is currently in analysis. Study 1 (Early Detection) was a case -cohort study design that used high density (1M) SNP arrays to track evolving somatic genomes in space and time in 248 patients with BE. As progressors approached the diagnosis of EA, they developed chromosome instability with gain or loss of whole chromosomes or large regions of chromosomes , whole genome doublings and mas sive chromosome instability. This genome instability increased diversity in the Barrett's epithelium that resulted in evolution to EA over a 2 -4 year period (Figure 1) . In contrast, non -progressors had only localized regions of genomic changes including 9p loss or copy neutral LOH, and damage in fragile sites, including frequent losses of CDKN2A, FHIT, and WWOX that remained remarkably stable over time (Figure 1) (NIH P01 CA091955, NIH Challenge Grant RC1 CA146973). Figure 1. Genetic divergence in a case -cohort study of evolving BE genomes over space and time using 1M SNP arrays.. Non-progressors (N=169) maintain a consistently low level of large chromosome alterations. In contrast, progressors developed marked chromosome instability (CIN) including whole g enome doublings (WGD) and genome -wide gains and losses of whole chromosomes, and large regions of chromosome beginning 24 -48 weeks before the diagnosis of EA, Study 2 (Prevention) . Our recent study of chemoprevention with aspirin or other NSAIDs was fund ed in response to the NCI Provocative Question: \"Given the evidence that some drugs commonly and chronically used for other indications, such as an anti -inflammatory drug, can protect against cancer incidence and mortality, can we determine the mechanism b y which any of these drugs work?\" (Funding: P01 CA091955, NIH Provocative Question Grant R01 CA179949). We hypothesized that use of aspirin and other NSAIDs exerted their protective effects through an evolutionary mechanism: decreasing the mutation rate in the BE epithelium . We tested this hypothesis in a well -designed study of NSAID users vs. nonusers with input collaboration and joint authorship from epidemiology and biostatistics colleagues. This study found that differences in 96 -trinuceotide somatic ba se substitutions between Brian Reid, MD, PhD NSAID use rs and nonusers were highly significant (p<3x10-16). The study also found that two Cosmic Signatures (1 and 17) were dominant in BE and were sensitive to NSAID use and smoking status. We also found that NSAID use decreased copy number alterations, especially copy gains, which are more common in EAs than BE. Finally, a pathway analysis found that NSAID users had significantly lower diversity of functional mutations in genes across nine pathways compared to non -users (p=0.007). Interestingly, the two pathways with the greatest reduction in mutations are known to interact with the immune system. These results have been recently published (Galipeau et al Genome Medicine Feb 27; 10(1): 17, 2018) and published in the Science Spotlight (http://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/spotlight/2018/04/hb_galipeau_genomemedicine.html ). (Funding: NIH P01 CA091955; NCI Provocative 2 A. NSAID use and somatic mutations Differences in 96 -trinucleotide somatic base substitutions between NSAID users and non -users.

This is a well -designed case -control study using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to compare mutation rates in patients who p 78rogressed from BE to EA compared to control patients with BE who did not progress. This study is currently in analysis. However, we have already discovered that patients that progress to EA continue to accumulate mutations in the BE segment while patients who do not progress to EA do not develop more mutations over time (Figure 3) (Funding: P01 CA091955). Brian Reid, MD, PhD Figure 3. Whole Genome Sequencing in a case control study of 40 patients with Barrett's esophagus who progressed from BE to EA and 40 control patients with BE who did not progress to EA. The total mutation load (SNVs plus indels) remained stable in patients who did not progress to EA. However mutation load increased over time in patients who progressed to EA. The mean increase in mutation load was 947 mutations per year in progressors. This study is still being analyzed . Figure 4. Summary: Progressors have about a 2-4 year window of opportunity for detection of TP53 mutation, CIN and WGD.

Proc Nat Acad Sci USA, 93: 7081 -7084, 1996. This manuscript and our other research was prominently referenced in a recent publication reporting that the sequence of gains or losses of chromosome arms followed by genome doublings occurs commonly in human cancers (Carter et al Nature Biotechnology 2012; 30: 413). It is now recognized that nearly 40% of all human cancers studied by TCGA have undergone a whole genome doubling (Zach et al in Barrett's esophagus. Nature Genetics, 22: 106 -109, 1999. This was the first model of genomic clonal evolut ion based on analyses over space and time in individuals at risk for cancer. It showed that clonal evolution was branching in contrast to linear models that have dominated clinical and cancer thought for more than a century. These branches underlie many as pects of cancer that we find frustrating clinically, including relapse after therapy , underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis . The me thod used in manuscripts 2 and 3 was used to construct phylogenetic trees based on somatic genomic alterations in advanced cancers (Gerlinger et al 366:883) and many others G., Blount, P.L. of Progression Cancer in Barrett's Esophagus: Baseline Histology and Flow Cytometry Identify Low and High Risk Patient Subsets.

Prior to this manuscrip t, there was an intense debate in the literature as to whether genomic instability or clonal expansion was the key driver in progression to cancer. This manuscript found that both interacted to produce an increased risk of evolving to esophageal adenocarci noma. and risk of neoplastic progression in Barrett's oesophagus: a prospective study.

This paper reported that clonal gene tic diversity, a measure derived from evolutionary biology, was an independent risk factor for progression from Barrett's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This manuscript was subsequently cited in a study of breast cancer that highlighted the import ance of genetic diversity as a cause of intratumor heterogeneity to more effectively plan cancer treatment strategies (Park et al J. Clin Invest 2010; 120:636). This concept that somatic genetic diversity is the fuel for cancer evolution is now well establ ished for many other human cancers. 8.Galipeau, Modulate CDKN2A, TP53, and DNA Content Risk for Progression to Esophageal Ad enocarcinoma. PLoS Medicine 4: 342 -54, 2007. This was a ten -year prospective cohort study in which we found that 9p LOH, 17p LOH and DNA content abnormalities, assessed by STR polymorphisms and DNA content flow cytometry, identified individuals with Barre tt's esophagus at high and low risk for progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. We also found that the 10 year risk of progression to cancer could be reduced from 80% to 30% by use of aspirin and other NSAIDs even in very high risk patients with advanced genomic abnormalities in their Barrett's esophagus. Oesophageal a Cancer 87 -101, 2010. PMCID: PMC2879265 . In this manuscri pt, we reviewed the world literature on Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma to identify the overarching problems and critical barriers to progress in prevention and early detection of this highly lethal cancer. We found that current clinical and research paradigms lead to overdiagnosis of slowly or non -progressing Barrett's esophagus and underdiagnosis of life threatening early esophageal adenocarcinoma. We then proposed a global research strategy to develop risk models to reduce both over - and underdiagnosis. The research and risk models for the general population and primary care settings have been addressed using the international BEACON consortium of which Dr. Reid is a founding member. 10.Esserman, L.J., Thompson, I.M. and Reid, B.J.

The article became the basis for an article by Yael Waknine in MEDSCAPE (December 23, 2013). Barrett's that did not progress to cancer typically had only small, localized changes that remained stable without generating diversity over long periods of foll ow-up. In contrast, Barrett's esophagus that progressed to cancer was characterized by punctuated gains or losses of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms beginning about four years prior to the diagnosis of cancer followed by catastrophic genome doublings beginning about two years prior to cancer diagnosis. Recent studies have inferred a similar sequence of events in many other cancers based on data at one point in space and time (See for example, Carter et al Nature Biotechnology 30: 413, 2012).

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common subtype of liver cancer and has almost tripled in incidence in the last 40 years (Saha, et al, 2016) . As the incidence of ICC continues to rise, it is imperative that we improve our understanding of the pathogenesis underlying this disease as well a s our therapeutic options in this highly lethal malignancy. We have developed, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive set of model systems to study ICC in the world, which includes a rich panel of human ICC cell lines, patient -derived xenografts as well as genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) . Our laboratory utilizes this unique resource to study pathogenic mechanisms of this disease and to identify therapeutic approaches with the goal of translating our w ork into novel clinical trials. Specificall y, our laboratory has three major areas of focus: 1.ICC Pathogenesis: In our recent work establishing novel GEMMs and in vitro stem cell systems, we identified a molecular program by which mutant IDH blocks differentiation of liver stem cells through the suppression of the master transcription factor HNF4 to promote ICC (Saha, et al. Nature, 2014) . We are developing additional GEMM systems to determine how expression of different ICC oncogenes and tumor suppressor mutations in specific cell types within the liver can impact regenerative responses to injury within the liver, and how these mutations may cooperate to drive tumorigenesis. 2.Genomics of drug sensitivity in ICC : The identification of readily targetable driver mutations in ICC, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations and fibroblast growth fa ctor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions, promise s to change the clinical paradigm for ICC to incorporate reflex genetic profiling of all ICC patients over the next decade. While novel targeted agents against these presumptive driver mutations are currently in early clinical development, we are using our genetically -faithful preclinical model systems (ICC GEMMs, PDXs and novel patient -derived cell lines) to fully characterize the nature of the response to these targeted therapies in order to understand how best to deploy them in the clinic . Supriya Saha, MD, PhD Beyond direct inhibition of mutant IDH or FGFR2 , we hypothesiz e that the widespread changes in cell differentiation state, metabolism and epigenetic control triggered by these driver mutations may confer additional vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Therefore, we have subjected our ICC cell line models to high throughput drug screens to identify synthetic lethal interactions in specific genetic subsets of this disease . As an example, this work has already le d to the discovery of a specific dependency of IDH mutant ICC on SRC kinase activity and a hypersensitivity of these cells to SRC family kinase inhibitors (Saha, et al., Cancer Discovery 2016). Our research will further explore the mechanisms underlying these synthetic lethal interactions and work to t ranslate our findings into novel clinical trials for these patients. 3.Predicting resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy in ICC : Although we have seen dramatic responses to targeted therapies in molecular subsets of ICC, prior experience indicates that acquired resistance is likely to eventually arise in response to any targeted therapy. Again taking advantage of our rich collection of model systems, we are using a systematic approach to predict and overcome these resistance mechanisms and will validate o ur findings using tissue samples obtained from patients undergoing targeted therapy clinical trials in parallel .

H. pylori establishes lifelong infection in the stomach of half the human population world -wide. The consequence of this infection ranges from undetected gastritis, to ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. Our lab is interested in the mechanisms by which this bacterium can establish and maintain a chronic infection and the molecular cross talk between the host and the bacteria during th e decades -long infection that can lead to disease. Our current projects include: 1.H. pylori genomic diversity: H. pylori clinical isolates show extensive heterogeneity both in sequence and the presence and absence of whole genes. Even in the context of a single human stomach there exist multiple clones with unique gene complements. We are currently investigating how this diversity is generated and the consequences of this diversity on patient outcome. This includes new efforts to track genetic changes that accumulate during chronic infection of humans and the phenotypic consequences of theses genetic changes. 2.Cell wall modification and cell shape: Shape mutants (straight or slightly curved rods instead of helical rods) have stomach colonization defects in our mouse infection model. Most of these cell shape factors alter the peptide content of the peptidoglycan cell wall. We are testing motility in viscous solutions, susceptibility to various stresses and peptidoglycan -mediated innate immune signaling to tea se out how these proteins and cell morphology contribute to survival in the stomach. To understand how changes in * very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Nina Salama, PhD cell wall peptides drive shape changes at size scale of the cell, we are using super -resolution microscopy of cell shape proteins and cell wal l synthesis probes combined with mathematical modeling. Host tissue responses to chronic infection: We have developed a number of mutant libraries including random transposon mutant libraries and a sequenced defined mutant library encompassing most non -essential genes. We are using these libraries in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems to probe H. pylori phenotypes important for pathogenesis. We use gastric epithelial tissue culture cells and primary gastric tissue organoids to monitor wild -type and mutant bacteria binding to host cells and stimulation of host cell signaling pathways including those activating innate immunity and host cell shape changes. To understand bacterial -host interactions in the complex environment of the stomach, which include s many cell types, we employ a mouse model of infection with wild -type and genetically modified mice that perturb immune pathways or stomach differentiation. This allows us to look at the relative fitness of different mutants, their location and their abil ity to induce host inflammation and pathology associated with gastric cancer SELECTED PUBLICATIONS 1.

Phil., M.A., Columbia University, Chemistry B.A., Wesleyan University, Chemistry CHEMICAL BIOLOGY , DRU G DISCOVE RY AND TRAGET VALIDATION The overarching goal of research in the Simon laboratory is the development of small molecules as mechanistic probes for a variety of cellular processes and as potential lead compou nds drug development . To this end we use interdisciplinary approach es ranging from chemical synthes is and medicinal chemistry to genetics and cell biology. The compounds we are studying have been identified from large collections of synthetic, drug-like compounds and from natural so urces. A majority of drug screens are phe notypic and unb iased in terms of specific targets. While screening compound libraries is a significant part of what we do the majority of our efforts go into target identification, mechanistic studies to understand the biology and ph armacology of lead compounds and efforts to improve their activity through chemical synthes is of analogs. The clinical use of several effective drugs is limited because of drug-induced h earing loss. Aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g. amikacin ) and platinum-based ca ncer drugs (e.g. cisplatin) are among drugs that can cause significant and in many cases irreversible hearing loss due to selective toxicity to the auditory hair cells. The mechanism of hair cell death, also called oto toxicity, is poorly u nderstood. In collaboration with Ed R ubel's laboratory at the Bloedel Center for Hearing Research and Department of Otolaryngology and Dave Raible's laboratory in the Department of Biological Structure both at the University of Washington, we carried out a screen using zebrafish mechanosensory hair cells as a model for mammalian auditory hair cells. This screen identified a family of small molecule inhibitors of aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death. Dr. Rubel's laboratory showed that our lead compound, PRO TO1, a lso protects rat auditory hair cells and preserves heari ng following doses of kanamycin that induce s ignificant hearing loss in co ntrol animals. We have optimized the protective activity as well as pharmacological properties of PROTO compounds through medicinal chemistry and structure activity relationship (SAR) studies . An optimized analogue of PROTO -1 called ORC -13661 was recently *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Julian Simon, PhD granted Investigational New Drug (IND) status by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Phase I safety trials started in early 2018. We previously identified inhibitors of yeast (S. cerevisiae) and human NAD-dependent deac etylases using yeast ce ll-based there are deac etylases called the sirtuins. These ub iquitous enzymes ha ve been s hown to play roles in functions ranging from transcriptional modulation to DNA damage responses and modulators of specific sirtuins ha ve been suggested as therapeutic agents for a variety of human d isease. In collaboration with Toni Bedalov's laboratory (FHCRC ), we are working to optimize our s irtuin-2 inhibitors using medicinal chemistry strategies for use as anti-lymphoma therapeutics. Sirtuin 2, or SIRT2, plays a unique role in the biology of B -cell development. Immature B -cell precursors have to undergo genetic rearrangements to mount an antigen -specific response to pathogens. The genetic rearrangements , such as V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation, would normally be perceived as DNA damage and lead to apoptosis were it not for the suppression of the DNA damage response regulator p53 and upregulation of the transcriptional B -cell lymphoma, mutation of histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and consequent hypo -acetylation of p53 and BCL6 accomplishes the same ends allowing DNA damage to go undetected. Inhibition of SIRT2 is B -cell lym phoma harboring HAT mutations restores p53 and BCL6 acetylation homeostasis and leads to cell death. We hope small molecule SIRT2 inhibitors will be effective B-cell lymphoma therapeutics.

To maintain aberrant proliferation, cancer cells enact changes in metabolic fluxes to support the increased synthesis of proteins, nucleotides and lipids needed to replicate cell biomass and divide. Thus, exploiting the metabolic differences between normal cells and cancer cells is a promising approach to improve cancer therapy. Indeed, many chemothera peutic agents are cytotoxic due to their ability to interfere with metabolic pathways in cancer cells. The fact that these treatments can be curative provides strong evidence that cancer cells have targetable metabolic vulnerabilities, making it critical t o better understand how cell metabolism supports proliferation and to determine which metabolic pathways are required for cancer growth. My laboratory uses mass spectrometry, isotopic tracing, metabolic flux measurements, and cancer models to broadly under stand how metabolism supports cell proliferation. The current goals of my laboratory range from testing metabolic targets in preclinical cancer models to discovery of novel metabolic interactions and pathways: 1. Investigating mechanisms of aspartate meta bolism for cancer therapy The amino acid aspartate is a critical substrate for protein and nucleotide synthesis that must be synthesized intracellularly to support cancer cell proliferation. Aspartate production is metabolically costly, and my work has sho wn that bolstering aspartate levels in cancer cells in vivo can increase tumor growth rate. These data indicate aspartate is an endogenous metabolic limitation for tumor growth and that any further suppression of aspartate would therefore inhibit cancer gr owth. Since aspartate levels are dependent on various synthesis pathways and metabolic fates in different conditions, all of which can modified by changes in gene expression and signaling, we will seek to understand how different cancer relevant biological processes including *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Lucas Sullivan , Ph.D. signaling cascades, metabolic adaptations, and drug sensitivities converge on aspartate metabolism to promote tumor growth and sensitize tumors to therapies. 2. Determining the roles of coenzyme homeostasis to support proliferative me tabolism While metabolism is classically viewed through the lens of efficient ATP production, maximization of biomass synthesis in proliferation requires balancing several other coenzyme systems in addition to ATP. My work has shown that maintenance of NAD +/NADH by mitochondrial respiration is essential for supporting proliferation, however, there are many other coenzyme systems in cells, e.g. NADP+/NADPH, Biopterins, ubiquinone/ubiquinol, etc., that are interrelated and are also used to support biosynthesi s. Further complication arises when considering that these coenzymes are also compartmentalized into organelles which have distinct roles in using these coenzymes to support local and global metabolism. Thus, we will determine how modifying coenzyme homeos tasis causes network effects throughout metabolism and how these consequences can affect cell proliferation. 3. Discovery of metabolic products and pathways The canonical map of metabolic reactions is often perceived as a complete list of all reactions that occur in all human cells. However, there is no reason to assume that this list is comprehensive in all tissue types and conditions. Recent work by me and others has identified previously uncharacterized metabolites in a subset of cancer cell s, providing a proof of concept that there may be many metabolites yet to be discovered. Using state -of-the-art mass spectrometry and a novel isotopic tracing technique we will seek to identify new metabolic products, and potentially entire new metabolic p athways, with the hope of identifying biomarkers and metabolic modifiers of disease .

Similar to myogenesis, neurogenesis is regulated by the related NeuroD transcription factors . We have been a ble to demonstrate that non-neuronal cells can be converted into neurons by the forced express ion of NeuroD family membe rs, and w e are comparing MyoD a nd NeuroD factors to determine how they achieve distinct transcriptional programs despite having very similar DNA binding regions. These studies are beginning to show how master regulatory factors drive programs of cell differentiation. DUX4 regulation of totipotency in development, muscular dystrophy , and cancer : We have identified the double -homeodomain transcription factor DUX4 as a gene that drives expression of the totipotent signature in the early cleavage stage embryo at the time of the initial wave of zygotic gene activation. Mis -expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle causes f acioscapulohumeral dystrophy , common form of muscular dystrophy . DUX4 mis -expression in muscle is caused by inefficient epigenetic repression of the DUX4 -containing D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4 , either because of deletions that decrease the number of the m acrosatellite units in the array or mutations in SMCHD1, a cohesion -family memb er protein that epigenetically represses repetitive regions, including the D4Z4 repeat array . Recently, we have also identified DUX4 expression in many solid cancers where it promotes immune evasion by down -regulating MHC Class I protein expression , possib ly related to a *very interested in taking a graduate student 2019-2 020 Stephen Tapscott, MD, PhD normal role in the immune evasion of the early embryo. Future work seeks to further understand the role of DUX4 in normal development, FSHD muscular dystrophy, and cancer; as well as seeking mechanisms of suppressing DUX4 expression for the rapeutic interventions.

Cell-cell adhesion is one of fundamental cellular functions pivotal for the formation of metazoan organisms. It is necessary for integration of individual cells into the tissues and organs. Cell adhesion mechanisms are regulated by intrinsic cell polarity pathways which govern the position of cell -cell and cell -substratum adhesion structures. In turn, cell adhesion structures can physically separate different plasma membrane domains and support and reinforce cell polarity. Together the cell adhesion and cel l polarity systems regulate each other to assemble individual cells into intricate 3 -dimentional structures necessary for proper development and homeostasis of multicellular organism s. We are interested in cell polarity and cell adhesion mechanisms because many of these cellular functions are perturbed or disrupted in human cancer. This makes cancer cells unable to properly read their cellular neighbors and overall microenvironment and adjust and control their behavior. Thus, the general aim of our research is to understand the mechanisms responsible for orchestrating ce llular behavior that help individual ce lls to work together to maintain normal tissue homeostasis and prevent cancer . Our laboratory is pursuing research in two major directions: 1.We study cell polarity and cell adhesion mechanisms and their role in normal mammalian development and cancer . 2.We are working on the identification of molecular mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutic approaches in human prostate cancer.
