WFA Handbook 2016 vi WFA Handbook 2016 1 1.1 Introduction Building evidence over the past two decades and recent food - borne illness outbreaks have significantly influenced growers' production management and, as an unintended consequence, their conservation decisions in many of the produce growing regions of the United States. On-farm food safety requirements by private industry or the government may be perceived as in conflict with conservation practices; too often the actions taken make this a reality . Consequently, agricultural food safety requirements, or independent actions taken to ensure compliance and continued market access, affect the work of conservation planners and stewardship growers. As these requirements increase across the country, planners and growers will have to understand and address food safety issues to work toward implementing integrated solutions and removing obstacles. This handbook helps conservation planners who work with produce growers, and the growers themselves, to co-manage food safety and conservation (see Figure 1) by understanding food safety risks in the growing environment, and by learning details of how specific management practices may reduce or increase food safety risk. Many of the vegetative conservation practices implemented by growers, such as filter strips, riparian forest buffers, windbreaks and wetlands, will likely help to reduce the risk of produce contamination by pathogens that cause human illness , though limited specific data is available at this time. Non-vegetative practices used to control soil erosion, decrease runoff, and manage animal wastes also aid in lessening the movement of human food-borne pathogens across the landscape, thus reducing the risk of crop contamination. The Healthy, Diverse Ecosystems Help Keep Pathogens in Check illustration (Figure 2) provides a summary of these conservation practices and food safety Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs). GAPs help to identify and remedy potentially overlooked well-recognized areas of concern, such as creating a \"no-harvest-zone\" around feces in the crop field, not growing leafy green vegetables immediately adjacent to manure or compost piles, and not planting under bird roosts. While no on-farm practice (conservation related or otherwise) provides complete and conclusive protection against food-borne pathogens, implementation of diverse conservation practices, with judicious monitoring, can support a farm's food safety management plan. 1: Introduction to Co-Managing Food Safety and Conservation Figure 1 Co-Management of Food Safety and Conservation \"'Co -Management' means farm system management approaches that respond to site - specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that promote ecological balance and public health by conserving biodiversity, soil, water, air, energy and other natural res ources, while also reducing pathogen hazards associated with food production.\" (National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition) Conservation practices, like this vegetative buffer , can help reduce the movement of pathogens to produce fields, but some buyers view these plantings as a food safety threat because they may attract wildlife. J.A. Baumgartner WFA Handbook 2016 2 1.2 Food -Borne Illness Attributed to Produce an d the Farm By the time produce reaches the table in the United States, it may have encountered contamination from any one of many sources along the supply-chain from farm to food preparation. From 1998 to 2008, approximately 46% of the illnesses documented by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) were attributed to produce. Contamination could have come from the farm, processing, storage , or shipping. It could also have come from handling by a store, or poor preparation in a restaurant or home. To understand how much food-borne disease may originate on the farm, it is helpful to look at the causes by which CDC tracks illnesses and outbreaks\u2014defined as an occurrence of two or more illnesses in a population. CDC has only been able to identify approximately 40% of all the causes. Of disease outbreaks data with identified causes between 1998 and 2008, 5% might have come from the farm. CDC tracked farm causes using the category \"Raw product/ingredient contaminated by pathogens from animal or environment (e.g., Salmonella enteritidis in egg, Norwalk (Norovirus) virus in shellfish, E. coli in sprouts).\" In the following four years, the percentage attributable to the farm decreased. Of the food-borne disease outbreaks with identified causes between 2009 and 2010, 0.5% might have come from the farm; in 2011, 1.3%, and in 2012, 0.12%. CDC's category for farm causes changed to: \"Foods originating from sources shown to be contaminated or polluted (such as a growing field or harvest area).\" Other farm activities, such as manufacturing, processing, packing, holding, and transportation, are not included here. As indicated, the data are not sufficiently granular to differentiate between produce and other farm products, such as eggs or meat, and 60% of the causes are not identified. While the percentage attributable to the farm could rise if the reporting mechanism for outbreaks becomes more refined in the future, this does give an indication that many of the outbreaks are coming from non -farm causes. Agricultural crops eaten without a kill step, such as cooking, are associ ated with a higher risk of illness than those that require cooking, acidification, or other actions expected to reduce pathogen populations. Some types of produce harbor more optimal surface sites for pathogens to persist or avoid wash - disinfection, such as netted melons with rind crevices or the water -congested stem-scar region of tomatoes. Several studies provide evidence that minimally processed leafy greens, subjected to varying degrees of cutting or shredding, provide thousands of attachment sites, ent ryways, and nutrients for pathogen growth and survival. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies cut leafy greens as a \"potentially hazardous food\" that requires regulated time-temperature controls for food safety. When illness is traced back to the farm, it has often been to these types of crops. FDA has published specific on-farm food safety guidances for melons, tomatoes, sprouts, leafy greens, and fresh -cut lettuces and leafy greens to help reduce human illness. 1.3 Pathogens of Concern for Produce The human body contains ten times more bacterial cells than human cells. Many beneficial bacteria in the gut help with digestion and immune responses. But not all microbes are beneficial. Ingesting contaminated food can allow pathogenic microbes to attach, invade, and reproduce in the gut, causing stomachaches and, in some cases, life-changing complications or death. Food-borne pathogens often Center for Disease Control (CDC) Facts From 1998 to 2008, about 46% of the illnesses documented by the CDC were attributed to produce. (Painter et al. 2013) Of the food -borne outbreaks with identified causes that might come from the farm: 5% was reported between 1998 and 2008. (CDC 2013 (a)) 0.5% in 2009 and 2010. (CDC 2013 (b)) 1.3% in 2011 . (CDC 2014 (a)) 0.1% in 2012 . (CDC 2014 (b)) CDC WFA Handbook 2016 3 have a low infectious dose, meaning that it only takes a few cells or infectious viral elements to cause illness in an individual. Because of this, washing produce to remove pathogens, while a good practice, cannot ensure safe consumption. The few pathogens that may remain after washing could still make someone sick, depending on the individual dose response. This document covers the four bacteria, from human and non-human sources, most likely to contaminate U.S. produce and cause illness\u2014Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (e.g., E. coli O157:H7), Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Listeria species. While better adapted to survive in the moist, anaerobic guts of their hosts, all may survive outside as well for different durations, depending on conditions. Uniquely, Listeria , a true environmental survivor, has many forms, though only two are pathogenic to humans. This review includes a protozoan, Cryptosporidium species, because of its survival strategy, even though it is less likely to cause contamination. While the protozoan may persist in the environment longer than the others due to its ability to form an oocyst\u2014a thick-walled protective spore\u2014it usually only makes a few individuals, rather than large numbers of people, sick because it doesn't replicate outside the host. Antimicrobial resistance in E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Liste ria species sometimes appears in livestock, wildlife, and environmental sources, potentially making illnesses from these cases difficult to treat and even more of a health hazard. For more discussion about these pathogens, see Appendix I. 1.4 Food Safety Regulations, Guidances, GAPs, and Plans Even though produce farms have not caused the majority of produce outbreaks, growers must respond to today's heightened awareness of food safety on the farm. Many food buyers, state or regional commodity marketing agreements, orders, associations , and some government agencies require (under voluntary signatory or mandatory programs) produce growers to follow specific food safety procedures, as well as to record the actions they take to implement these procedures. FDA's regulation, Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (hereafter referred to as FDA Produce Rule), under the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, was written in order to help reduce food-borne illnesses and outbreaks with the consumption of fresh produce. This handbook only addresses the most pertinent conservation-related regulations; there are many other regulations covered in FDA's Produce Rule. FDA also published guidance for on-farm food safety in 1998 and more recent commodity specific updates. Some states have their own food safety standards and government audit requirements. Many public institutions, including military, hospitals, penitentiaries, and providers to schools under USDA programs, as well as private food buyers, require food safety plans accredited by third-party auditors. Just as an environmental assessment can be done as part of a farm stewardship plan to identify areas or activities that impact a farm's natural resources, a food safety risk assessment can be done as part of its food safety plan. This assessment done by the grower, ideally with the assistance of a food safety specialist, identifies areas or activities that may directly or indirectly expose crops to pathogen contamination. The plans are typically ba sed on a set of GAPs developed by multiple stakeholders including industry, government, auditors, academia, and agricultural extension agencies. These GAPs usually focus on five categories of assessment, four of which are highly relevant for the co -management Outbreaks of Shiga toxin -producing Escherichia coli , such as E. coli O157:H7 pictured here, have been traced back to produce, including fresh -cut spinach, lettuce, and salad mix. E. H. White, CDC WFA Handbook 2016 4 of food safety and conservation: (1) water quality, (2) soil amendments, (3) wild and domestic animals, and (4) the surrounding environment. The fifth, worker health and hygiene, is critically important but not a focus in co-management considerations. Co-managing for food safety and conservation involves managing non-crop vegetation, water bodies, soil amendments, and domestic animals and wildlife to minimize dissemination and persistence of pathogens on the farm and in the landscape. In a well - intentioned but misplaced effort to eliminate all risk of pathogen contamination, some GAP requirements by produce buyers, or the subjective misinterpretation of them by auditors, prove unintentionally counterproductive or indifferent to conservation goals. 1.5 Conflicts with Conservation Goals When growers have to comply with multiple food safety requirements, they may aim for the highest common denominator, implementing the strictest food safety management practices to appease all buyers and regulating bodies. In the preamble to FDA's Produce Rule, which contains their thinking about why they wrote what they did, they acknowledge that animals do not pose a universally significant food safety risk. In the Produce Rule itself, FDA does not authorize \"the 'taking' of threatened or endangered species . . .\" and does not require growers \"to take measures to exclude animals from outdoor growing areas, or to destroy animal habitat or otherwise clear farm borders around outdoor growing areas or drainages.\" (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.84). However, since wildlife feces , generally a low risk, is a recognized source of human pathogens and in certain localized populations is a significant risk factor, wildlifeand the habitat that harbors itis often a major focus of standards in food safety GAPs. While current GAP documents rarely target the direct removal of habitat or encourage the killing of wildlife, the observation of presence and perceived risk of wildlife and wildlife habitat can translate into a drop-off of sales, particularly when produce buyers refuse to buy the portion of a grower's crop that is located near wildlife habitat. This situation negatively incentivizes growers and has resulted in their removing conservation practices that support ecological functions critic al to public health. In 2006, spinach contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, traced back to a farm on California's Central Coast, was cited as the cause of death of five people. While it was never determined how the spinach became contaminated, non - native feral pigs, contaminated irrigation water, and adjacent cattle operations were all considered potential sources during the official environmental investigation. Wildlife and the habitat it occupied were seen as a serious food safety risk with potential to transfer pathogens to the crop. Although research thus far has indicated that native wildlife has a low relative prevalence of carrying pathogens that cause food-borne illness in humans, localized conditions may create situations that cause concern, such as proximity to known domestic animal sources of key pathogens. Surveys conducted by the Resource Conservation District (RCD) of Monterey County after the 2006 spinach outbreak found growers adopting environmentally destructive measures to comply with food safety audit requirements and to keep their markets. In 2007, 89% percent of growers managing 140,000 acres on California's Central Coast reported that they had actively discouraged or eliminated wildlife from crop a reas. Growers began creating bare ground buffers around their crops, trapping wildlife, using poison bait stations, and fencing out wildlife. A later survey conducted by the RCD of Monterey County in 2009, showed that some of these reactionary measures had lessened. Research published in 2013 found that over a five-year period after the 2006 In response to food safety pressures in the 5 years after the 2006 spinach contamination , about 13% of remaining riparian habitat was eliminated or degraded in the Salinas River Valley, such as this which is shown between the red lines . J. Couperus , Lighthawk 2008 WFA Handbook 2016 5 contamination, approximately 13% of the remaining riparian habitat in the region had been eliminated or degraded. If practices such as these occurred throughout all California cropl ands, estimates predicted that up to 40% of riparian habitat and 45% of wetlands in some of its counties would be impacted. In a 2015 study that combined land use maps with pathogen prevalence in produce, irrigation water and rodents, researchers found that from 2007 to 2013 habitat removal was not effectively reducing E. coli or Salmonella pathogen contamination risk on California's Central Coast. This study and many others cited in this handbook support the idea that successful food safety measures can incorporate wildlife habitat and conservation practices with the end goal of protecting human health. 1.6 Addressing Food Safety and Conservation Growers can achieve co-management of food safety and conservation in diverse situations, ranging from those whose markets demand the strictest food safety protocols, to those who are internally motivated to do the best they can at the least expense to the environment. Actions depend on how much preventive planning, monitoring, and exclusion they deem necessary. Using th e multiple-barrier approach, growers can: (1) minimize the likelihood of pathogens entering the farm; (2) diminish likelihood of pathogens contaminating crops; (3) reduce the spread of pathogens to crops when livestock are on the farm; and (4) prevent pathogens from leaving the farm. This document builds on the ongoing work by major research scientists, food safety regulatory agencies, and extension personnel, many of whom are already working on similar teaching tools, though not necessarily targeting food safety and conservation co-management strategies. This text includes key points learned from grower phone surveys and farm visits in Florida, New York, and Californiasuch as how the diversity of production, climate, regulatory, landscape, and wildlife features influence produce production management decisions. Many of the growers who participated in these interviews supported conservation measures and wanted to identify pathogen sources and the management practices they could use to help reduce the risk of pathogens that might contaminate their produce. FDA's Produce Rule has made co-management of food safety and conservation possible. In the Preamble to the Rule FDA states that they \"encourage the application of practices that can enhance food safety and that are also consistent with sustainable conservation.\" Conservationists and growers knowledgeable about basic food safety issues can help plan for and/or can implement co -management practices that benefit natural resources and biodiversity on the far m and in the larger landscape. WFA Handbook 2016 6 Figure 2 Healthy Diverse Ecosystems Help Keep Pathogens in Check This illustration first appeared in WFA's publication \"A Farmer's Guide to Food Safety and Conservation\" October 2013. WFA Handbook 2016 7 Key to Illustration: Healthy, Diverse Ecosystems Help Keep Pathogens in Check Note: The Healthy, Diverse Ecosystems Help Keep Pathogens in Check illustration is not drawn to scale ; it serves as a visual summary of the conservation practices and food safety actions used to address food safety referenced in this document. These practices and actions do not provide complete and conclusive protection against food -borne pathogens on a g iven farm/ranch, and some vegetative conservation practices may attract wildlife that can vector pathogens. When implementing in -field practices to address food safety, one should take into account the conditions present on the farm/ranch and use this info rmation to assess the effectiveness of a given practice in reducing the risk of food -borne pathogen contamination of crops. 1. Sun: Ultraviolet ( UV) radiation from the sun may inactivate recently deposited pathogens on the surfaces of soil and leaves, as well as in clear water. The sun also facilitates the desiccation of pathogens, which leads to pathogen reduction. 2. Dust from animal activity (NRCS Co nservation Practice Standard 371) is reduced with the application of water by sprinklers and with manure harvesting. Reducing emissions and removing manure proactively are cost-effective means of mitigating pathogen transfer. 3. Diversions (362) redirect water runoff from confined animal feeding operations to waste treatment and sedimentation lagoons, pr eventing the movement of waterborne pathogens to nearby farm traffic areas, fields, and waterways. Vegetated diversions also intercept organic matter and soil carrying pathogens in runoff from pastures and divert potentially contaminated water away from produce fields. The diversions slow pathogen dispersal and provide a matrix for beneficial bacteria and protozoa that compete with and consume pathogens. Plants shou ld be selecte d for low-flow filtering capacity and the ability for high flows to flow through the vegetation. Selecti on criteria should also consider how well air and sunlight can penetrate the vegetation, as the cool, moist, shaded interior vegetation may provide favorable habitat for pathogen survival. Otherwise additional maintenance will be required that regularly harvests and removes excess vegetation. 4. Waste storage pond (313) temporarily stores waste, such as manure runoff from concentrated animal feeding op erations, thereby reducing pollution potential in the landscape. The waste storage pond shou ld be properly designed and maintained to not overflow. Food safety Good Agricultural Practice s (GAPs ) recommend that the effluent from the ponds not be used on raw agricultural commodities. Monitoring of animal movement around the pond and between waste handling areas and crop fields should be a scheduled activity. 5. Restored wetlands (657) can considerably reduce pathogen transport by slowing the water, which increases the interaction time, and providing a matrix for beneficial microbes . The diverse plant and microbial community establishes desirable interactions that serve to limit pathogen persistence. Use of vegetation and designs that facilitate water moving slowly over long periods in the wetland allow the best chance for pathogen reduction in water draining from the wetland. The vegetation in the wetland may decrease the ability of UV light to reach the pathogens, which may increase survival. However, pathogens may be retained on vegetation. As water recedes, the pathogens that are retained on the vegetation may be exposed to sun light and desiccation . 6. Riparian forest buffers (391) are vegetated areas along bodies of surface water, including streams, wetlands, and lakes. They may trap wind-borne pathogens on their vegetation and filter waterborne pathogens susp ended organic -soil particulates and other solids. The diverse plant and microbial community in the buffers encourages interactions limiting p athogen persistence. WFA Handbook 2016 8 7. Flooded field: Food safety GAPs recommend that raw agricultural commodities not be planted on lands that often flood. If and when a flood occurs, it may take time for pathogens pr esent in the soil to die off. Depending on the frequency of floods, the field could be fallowed for a period, replanted to a cover crop, or possibly, permanently taken out of produ ction with the restoration of riparian habitat. 8. Windbreaks (380) can trap dust containing pathogens and prevent it from entering produce fields. Plants shou ld be selecte d with foliar and structural characteristics that optimize dust/pathogen interception. If interior vegetation is too dense, it may provide a cooler, moister, and shadier environment, which may create a favorable conditions for temporary pathogen survival. 9. Evidence of animal intrusion in a crop field should be monitored. FDA requires that growers monitor a raw agricultural commodity during the growing season for significant evidence of potential contamination , and if found, take measures to reduce risk of harvesting the contaminated crop (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.83). Food safety GAPs recommend placing a no-harvest buffer around the contaminated crop. The following considerations all factor into determining the appropr iate risk reduction actions taken: significant numbers of animals; significant amounts of animal feces; significant crop destruction; the type of animals; wh ether they are present intermittently or continually; if they are there because of food, a movement corridor, or live next to the crop; and if they are seen before planting or right before harvesting. 10. Hedgerows (422) may trap waterborne pathogens in their root systems and wind-borne pathogens on their vegetation. Shaded interior of the vegetation may provide favorable conditions for temporary survival of pathogen if too dense. 11. Irrigation (449): FDA requires growers use irrigation water sources that do not exceed specified levels of generic E. coli , when water is directly touching raw agricultural commodities (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7112.44). Management techniques that promote i nfiltration of the water into the soil can r educe runoff and may aid in reducing the movement of pathogens already present in the field. 12. Sediment basins (350) capture and detain sediment-laden runoff that may contain pathogens. Correctly designed, basins allow sufficient time for the sediment to settle out of the water. With moist, cool conditions, the basin may support the survival of pathogens. Having a sediment basin that dries down as rapidly as possible helps to alleviate these moist conditions and helps reduce pathogen survival. Moist sediment that is removed from the basin and put on cropland shou ld be treated as contaminated, with an e stablished time period similar to non -composted soil amendments between its application and the next crop's harvest. 13. Riparian forest root zone: The roots of the riparian forest promote water infiltration and provide biological activity. This helps divert pathogens from surface water, and encourages interactions with other soil microorg anisms that can limit p athogen persistence. 14. Stream ecosyst em: In a stream ecosystem, diverse microbial communities are thoug ht to reduce pathogens by competition, parasitism, and predation. Clear water allows light to reach pathogens, which can lead to their reduction . However, s ome algae and protozoa may serve as an alternate host for p athogens, allowing them to live even when environmental conditions are unfavorable for their survival . 15. Diverse microbial populations compete with and consume pathog ens in water and soil and on plant surfaces. When diverse microbial popu lations are present, beneficial mic robes compete with pathogens for carbon and nitrogen, while others kill and consu me them. Diverse microbial communities in water and on plants also compete for resources and/or consu me pathogens. In some instances, biofilms\u2014a matrix of bacteria and carbohydrates\u2014can support beneficial microbes and in other cases harbor pathogens. WFA Handbook 2016 9 16. Cover crops (340): Rotating with cover crops increases soil organic matter and suppor ts soil microbial communities that may aid in suppressing pathogens. Cover crops may also reduce the movement of pathogens in water runoff by trapping pathogens in their roots and leaves. They can be grown during a \"waiting period\" b etween events that might pose contamination risk (e.g., grazing, flooding or significant animal intrusion) and the planting of a raw agricultural commodity. Cover crops also reduce open soil, which helps reduce dust transmission problems. 17. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (595) of vertebrates such as mice and squirrels can help control pest animals that enter crop fields. Having a few predatory animals, such as hawks or owls, on the farm is less of a risk than numerous prey species. A crop shou ld not be planted directly under a raptor nest box or a roost, so that it is not contaminated with raptor feces. Farm traffic should not carry fecal droppings into the cropped area or equipment and storage yard. 18. Harvesting orchard fruit from the tree, not the ground, when it will be consumed fresh, is required by FDA (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.114). Fallen fruit may have come in contact with animal feces. 19. Field borders (386) can intercept and reduce waterborne pathogens moving in overland flow from the field. This planting encourages infiltration and serves as a buffer between the field and the riparian vegetation. 20. Tree bird roost: Food safety GAPs recommend that a no-harvest zone be established under branches that hang over the field to ensure bird feces will not touch the crop. 21. Wildlife corridors allow wildlife to access resources (water, food, and cover ) without having to cross crop f ields or leave their preferred habitat. 22. Crop placement: Food safety GAPs recommend that leafy green vegetables or other raw agricultural commodities not be planted near manure stockpiles or composting facilities and w indrows, or other areas of contamination, as pathogens may transfer to the field via water or wind. 23. Compost (317): FDA requires compost to maintain aerobic conditions while heating up to a temperature that results in significant p athogen reduction (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.54). Co mpost itself suppor ts beneficial organisms inactivate, and consu me pathogens. Unfinished compost or compost that has become re -contaminated could be a source of pathogens; thus, measures shou ld be taken to prevent these below par composts from moving on to adjacent fields through wind or water. For information on proper compost management practice s refer to \"Ch apter 2: Composting\" in Part 637 of the USDA, NRCS National Engineering Handbook. 24. Conservation cover (327) is used to establish and maintain perennial vegetative cover to protect soil and water resources on land retired from agricultural produ ction or land in need of permanent protective cover that will not be used for forage produ ction. Perennial plants may trap windborne pathogens on the vegetation and waterborne pathogens in the root system. 25. Prescribed grazing (528) uses animals to manage vegetation. It also helps to increase water infiltration, reduce runoff, and prevent erosion. This aids in stopping the movement of pathogens in water runoff. Grazing animals are a reasonably foreseeable source of pathogens; thus, measures shou ld be taken to prevent pathogens from the animals' feces from moving onto adjacent fields through wind or water. WFA Handbook 2016 10 Successful co-management requires awareness and assessment of contamination pathways and prevalence (dynamic percentage of pathogens in a population) in order to plan, install and manage conservation practices with sensitivity to food safety concerns. Just as it is impossible to completely eradicate pathogens from the growing areas, it is impossible to predict with certainty when and where pathogens will occur. The high diversity of natural environments and the changing way in which pathogens react to them make prediction difficult. Typically pathogens move in water, on the wind, with animals, and through human actions. Prevalence of pathogens in wild and domestic animals can be assessed, but regional influences may cause significantly different outcomes. Pr evalences serve as indicators of common risk potential rather than the foundation for sweeping generalizations at either extreme of absolute risk to absolute safety. 2.1 Waterborne Pathways Water may carry pathogens to produce production areas via numerous pathways, as shown in Figure 3. Manure applied to nearby lands, overflow from manure lagoons , runoff from manure and compost storage sites, and fecal matter deposited by livestock and/ or wildlife throughout a watershed may be carried in surface runoff down slope to crop areas or to surface waters. Concentrated rainfall events can cause runoff, preferential flow , and flooding, which can quickly transport pathogens over large areas. Crops that come in contact with floodwaters are considered adulterated by the FDA regardless of ability to detect chemical or biological hazards. Figure 3 Process Affecting Microbial Quality of Irrigation Water Adapted from Pachepsky et al. 2011. Groundwater irrigation sources may also become contaminated. Pathogen movement through the soil profile is largely controlled by soil structure and preferential flow channels, which are determined by the diameter and continuity of macropores in soil. Movement of pathogens through the soil profile to shallow groundwater supplies is possible with high rainfall/irrigation rates and very porous soils. Improperly managed or leaking septic systems may also present a risk, particularly those in close 2: Pathogen Routes and Prevalence on the Farm WFA Handbook 2016 11 proximity to water sources used for irrigation or in areas where improperly percolating drain fields allow contamination. However, in many cases groundwater contamination is caused not by movement of pathogens through the soil profile, but rather by contamination aroun d an active, or abandoned and unsealed, well-head or in the water distribution system. In some areas of the country tertiary treated wastewater may be used as an irrigation water source. After going through primary and secondary treatment, wastewater is subjected to tertiary (advanced) treatment, which may include processes that use ultraviolet light and/or chlorination to maximize the removal of enteric bacteria, protozoan parasites, and human enteric viruses. While there are no federal standards for using tertiary treated wastewater for irrigation on crops, almost half of the states do have regulations of various kinds. California and Florida produce the most tertiary treated wastewater. As with municipal water sources, testing should ensure that these w aters are safe for use; to date, no illness has been linked to the use of these reclaimed water sources in produce production. If either municipal or tertiary treated waters are inadequately treated, these could present contamination risk. Water may become contaminated by direct animal deposits or by bioaerosols in systems that employ irrigation ponds, reservoirs, ditches, and canals where either rainfall or surface runoff is used in distribution. Studies have found that the mammals and aquatic birds that inhabit wetlands can disseminate Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and other human pathogens. If waterfowl or other wildlife congregate in a wetland in large numbers, caution should be taken, as the water flowing out of the wetland may be contaminated with pathogens. Contact with pathogens attached to algae, bank soils and re-suspended sediment in ponds, reservoirs, ditches, and canals may also lead to contamination. Pathogen concentration is frequently higher in sediments of water storage areas and waterways than in overlying water. Disturbing these sediments may reintroduce pathogens into the water supply. Water transported thro ugh pipes interacts with biofilms \u2014bacterial communities that establish on surfaces and create a protective extracellular matrix of polysaccharides \u2014that may or may not harbor pathogens. Distribution systems handling reclaimed water have been shown to have an increased pathogen presence in these biofilms. Water unintentionally contaminated by pathogen sources during transport may end up in irrigation used on crops. Only a few produce outbreaks have been traced back to irrigation water as the confirmed source of pathogen contamination. To make the link from water to humans, scientists have begun to use a DNA fingerprinting technique to compare the DNA of pathogens isolated from water samples collected at the suspected contamination site to that of the pathogen s isolated from the contaminated crop and from the reported ill persons (Table 1). Many unconfirmed cases (not shown) have suggested that irrigation water may have been the source of contamination. These cases remain unconfirmed because there was no direct match between the outbreak strain and the strain found in the water; there was no direct use of the pathogen-laden water (groundwater was used for irrigation but pathogens were found in nearby river water); or potential environmental sources of the pathogens (animals, manure, and compost) near the water tested negative. Water r unning off livestock yards may be contaminated with pathogens. USDA NRCS WFA Handbook 2016 12 2.2 Airborne Pathways Pathogens may enter the crop environment as bioaerosols \u2014windborne particles that contain living organisms. Windborne particulate matter may include desiccated fecal matter with viable pathogen cells or dust/soil/debris with adhered pathogens . Such contaminated materials may originate from a variety of nutrient management systems , including manure lagoons, manure piles, and compost facilities. Locations with heavy fecal depositions where animals congregate, such as wild or domesticated animal loafing areas, pasture/range land, and large or small confined livestock operations , can also serve as sources of pathogen-containing bioaerosols. Additionally, vehicle traffic or farm equipment traversing these areas can send contaminated dust into the air. Factors influencing the risk level of produce contaminat ion include the distance between the contamination source and the produce field ; particle size and buoyancy; wind intensity, speed, and direction; land surface topography; and physical features. Land applied with untreated wastewater and biosolids may contain persistent populations of pathogens. Winds may distribute fine droplets of contaminated water or particulates to adjacent areas. Some of these cases are described in more detail in Table 2. However, not all animal-generated bioaerosols cause contamination \u2014for example, only non- pathogenic bacteria were found in the air next to fields where sheep grazed in a leafy green producing region of California.

WFA Handbook 2016 14 2.3 Wildlife Prevalence and Pathways Pathogen Prevalence in Wildlife Native wildlife has so far been found to have a low relative prevalence of carrying human pathogens. Even though the widespread risk appears low, pathogen prevalence in localized wildlife populations remains a concern. While hundreds of studies have detected food-borne pathogens in wild animals, only a few have shown a direct relationship with human illness. In each of the cases in Table 3, the DNA patterns in the samples taken from animal feces were indistinguishable from those in the contaminated crop and the reported ill persons. Unconfirmed instances orange juice and the presence of a nearby toad, and with apple juice and deer in the orchard were not listed because there was no direct match of outbreak strain. More often, native and non-native wildlife that harbor food-borne pathogens have not been implicated in cases related to human illness outbreaks. These studies may simply determine that certain wildlife have the pathogen, or may discern how many carry the pathogen\u2014the prevalence. The discus sion below and in Figures 4\u20147 in Appendix II describe the prevalence found in wildlife. It is helpful to understand that many biological factors and sampling methodologies influence the detection of pathogens in wildlife. If wildlife populations live near contaminated sources, they are much more likely to become infected or simply mechanically transport pathogens on their skin, fur or feathers. Just as with humans, animals tend to be more susceptible to pathogens depending on their health, stress level, age, and immunity. Some pathogens have no known virulence to the animal host but have serious consequences in a human host. The ability to detect pathogens in individual wildlife depends on the amount of pathogen it carries, the degree of activity and fitness of the pathogen, and the specific methods used to sample, recover, and detect the target pathogen. Sampling from the animal itself is a much more reliable indication of prevalence than sampling feces from the ground, which m ay introduce contamination or exposure to conditions that increase, decrease, or inactivate the pathogen. The pre - process handling and sample size is important for credibility \u2014if too small, it may not accurately represent prevalence. As with any research, studies documenting pathogens in wildlife are snapshots that reflect the local conditions but do not necessarily give a comprehensive picture of pathogens in the landscape. For a more thorough discussion of the complexities of data interpretation , see Appendix II. E. coli O157:H7 Prevalence in U.S. Native and Non-Native Mammal and Avian Species Since cattle are considered the primary reservoirs of E. coli O157:H7 and possibly other E. coli pathogens, most wildlife studies examining its prevalence take place near cattle. Zero to less than 1% prevalence was found in deer, rodents, and in various other native mammals; and about 2% prevalence Table 3: Recorded Outbreaks Associated with Wildlife Crop Pathogen Wildlife Location Spinach (a) E. coli O157:H7 non-native feral pigs* California Straw - berries (b) E. coli O157:H7 black -tailed deer Oregon Peas (c) Campylobacter jejuni sandhill cranes Alaska Carrots (d) Yersinia pseudotuberculosis shrews Finland * While feral pigs were found with the same DNA pattern of E. coli O157:H7 as that found on the spinach, so were nearby cattle and pasture soil, and water/sediments from a creek that may have contaminated the irrigation well. From : (a) Jay 2007; (b) Laidler and Keene 2012; (c) McLaughlin 2008; (d) Kangas 2008. WFA Handbook 2016 15 was found in elk and coyotes. The same low rate was found in songbirds (0-1%), non-native rock pigeons (0%), and European starlings (0-2%) that visited dairies or cattle feedlots. A few species have somewhat higher levels, including brown-headed cowbirds (about 3%), American crow (over 5%), and feral pigs (4-5%), possibly because they come in contact with the pa thogen-laden organic matter more often. Brown-headed cowbirds eat seeds and insects from cattle feces, and American crows and feral pigs eat garbage and carrion. Pigs are also known to eat other animal's feces. As mentioned in Table 3, feral pigs were one of several possible E. coli O157:H7 sources in the 2006 spinach outbreak in California, and black-tailed deer were the source of this pathogen in a strawberry outbreak in Oregon. Figure 4 in Appendix II gives further details. Salmonella Prevalence in U.S. Native and Non-Native Mammal and Avian Species Feral pigs (>14%) presented twice the prevalence of Salmonella than any other wildlife species. Deer studies showed less than 3% prevalence with the exception of one study in Texas where deer shared rangeland with sheep and both had prevalences around 8%. Other wildlife prevalences were detected for raccoons (>7%), European starlings (0 - 7%), tule elk (4%), rodents (3%), and various other native mammals (4%) and birds (3%). As mentioned above, birds that feed on insects and seeds in manure, and scavenge or eat carrion seem to more often carry the pathogen. Due to the significant numbers of European starlings in one cattle feedlot, it was thought that the Salmonella contamination of the cattle's feed and water was related. Figure 5 in Appendix II gives additional details. Salmonella Prevalence in U.S. Native Amphibians and Reptiles Even though most human illnesses are caused by the \"warm-blooded\" Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, all of the 1,500 \"warm-blooded\" and 1,000 \"cold-blooded\" Salmonella serotypes found in animals and the environment must be considered potentially dangerous . One-quarter of the \"cold- blooded\" Salmonella serotypes are now known to be human pathogens. People, especially children, often become sick after handling pet reptiles. Various studies have shown that, in nature, from one to almost 40% of amphibians, and from zero to almost 100% of reptiles carry Salmonella. Such a large range of prevalence suggests that the higher occurrences of this pathogen may relate to other contamination in the landscape. Figure 6 in Appendix II gives further information. Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and Listeria Prevalence in U.S. Native and Non-Native Mammal and Avian Species Feral pigs were found with high levels of Campylobacter jejuni in both their mouth and gut (40%), suggesting that contamination can come from pigs eating the crop as well as defecating on it. Different types of waterfowl (36%) have also been found at times to carry high levels of these pathogens, including Canada geese (4-16%), which carried antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter. Other wildlife known to carry Campylobacter include deer, raccoons, elk, skunks, squirrels , and California gulls. One study reported that most of Campylobacter serotypes found in gulls were not closely related to species commonly associated with human illness. As shown in Table 3, sandhill cranes carrying Campylobacter pathogens precipitated an outbreak traced back to peas. Figure 7 in Appendix II gives further details. Current research sugg ests that non -native feral pig population s may have higher prevalence of many food -borne pathogens than populations of native wildlife. B. Higginbotham, TX AgriLife Ext. Service, Bugwood.org WFA Handbook 2016 16 Feral pigs were found with a 5% prevalence of Cryptosporidium. Various rodent species were found to have 7% prevalence, while deer mice were found with a much higher of prevalence of 26%. A preliminary study reported that the prevalence of rodents with Cryptosporidium is inversely related to the biodiversity present. It suggests that non-crop vegetation clearing and indiscriminate poison baiting led to the decrease of rodent species diversity and the increase of a single species (deer mice). As the single species proliferated, the interaction between individuals of that species increased, which may have caused an increase in pathogen prevalence in those individuals. Listeria has been found in many types of mammals and birds, including deer, moose, elk, fox, raccoon, skunk, geese, and crows. Pathogen Vectoring by Wildlife Fecal matter contact with a crop, as when feral pigs or native wildlife come into cropped areas and defecate on or trample the crop with contaminated feet, is an obvious pathway of contamination, though not all fecal matter contains pathogens of human health concern. Pathogens may also be transferred when animals eat part of the crop or brush up against the crop with contaminated fur a nd feathers. Crops that grow close to the ground (e.g., lettuce, spinach) or are harvested from the ground (e.g., almonds, walnuts) are at higher risk of contamination. Wildlife is universally present in growing areas, some more so than others depending on the surrounding environment, but not typically in high numbers. Animal movement is virtually impossible to completely control, and minute amounts of fecal matter contamination may escape notice during harvesting, allowing contaminated product to enter the supply chain. At times, wildlife has been found to vector pathogens from areas of high pathogen concentration to crops. High concentration areas may include livestock operations, waste storage facilities, or landfills/dumps. These areas attract some s pecies of mammals, birds, and insects, presenting unique co - management challenges because of the ease with which they may move around the landscape and the difficulty of restricting their access to crop areas. Wild mammals that share rangeland with lives tock may pick up pathogens and transport them to crops. Feral pigs on cattle rangeland in California especially pose a problem. While deer may also share grazing lands with cattle, they carry lower levels of pathogens than the pigs. Both deer and sheep grazing on rangeland have had somewhat similar elevated levels when compared to animals that do not share grazing areas. Birds feeding in confined cattle operations may, but not always, become infected with pathogens encountered there. Not all birds are equal ly likely to frequent areas with potentially high concentrations of pathogens. For example, arboreal chickadees are less likely to feed at a landfill than seagulls, and brown-headed cowbirds are more likely than chickadees to eat seeds and insects in manure. Understanding which wildlife frequent the growing area, as well as how far and where they forage for food beyond the farm, may guide risk assessment. Filth flies, which breed or feed in animal wastes, carry some pathogens on their bodies and may prese nt a risk. Researchers remain uncertain that the amount of contamination likely to occur via this pathway denotes a measurable risk, and note that pathogens deposited on an exposed crop surface in typical growing conditions may not survive for long. Other insects, for example bees, syrphids, leaf hoppers, and a range of other beneficial and pest insects may also visit produce fields, though because they are not specifically drawn to animal wastes, their activity does not elicit the same concern as a contamination pathway. Additionally, bees have been found to avoid flowers inoculated with E. coli WFA Handbook 2016 17 pathogens, and bee propolis has toxicity factors that reduce survival of the pathogens bees might carry to the hive. 2.4 Domestic Animal Prevalence and Pathways Pathogen Prevalence in Livestock and Companion Animals Since many crops may be part of a mixed crop/livestock operation, or may be grown near neighbors with livestock, it is important to understand the role livestock play in the spread of food-borne pathogens onto crops. For a thorough discussion, see Introduction to Waterborne Pathogens in Agricultural Watersheds, USDA NRCS Nutrient Management Technical Note No. 9. Livestock and companion animals can carry pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and Cryptosporidium. Some pathogens are more common in some animals than in others. Depending on their innate immunity, the virulence of the pathogen, and the nature of the infection, many animals remain asymptomatic. E. coli O157:H7 Prevalence in Domestic Animals Pathogenic E. coli is widespread in dairy and beef cattle in North America, whereas sheep are major reservoirs in Australia. Depending on the area, 7% to 100% of cattle operations may contain animals infected with E. coli O157:H7 (see Table 14 in Appendix II). Even in infected herds, relatively few individuals may carry the pathogenic E. coli. However, a small number can excrete large intestinal loads of the bacteria for long periods, while others may have a large load but excrete it quickly without being a constant source. Cattle in particular may carry pathogenic E. coli asymptomatically, tending to excrete it in the warm months of the year. A comprehensive USDA review indicates that grain -fed cattle in concentrated animal feeding operations have higher prevalence rates tha n those on pasture eating forage, even though both can be found with pathogenic E. coli. Pigs, dogs, poultry, and bison raised for slaughter also harbor pathogenic E. coli. Horses and cats rarely carry it. Young livestock carry higher levels of pathogens than adults. Salmonella Prevalence in Domestic Animals Salmonella, most commonly found in poultry, can also be found in pigs, horses, and cattle. In studies of different layer chicken houses, the occurrence of Salmonella ranges from 7% to 68%. About 31% of the dairy herds studied had at least one cow with a positive Salmonella culture. In a multi-state study, 4.7% of the 2,496 environmental samples tested positive for Salmonella. Of the positive samples, 57.3% came from swine farms, 17.9% from dairy farms, 16.2% from poultry farms, and 8.5% from beef cattle farms (see Table 15 in Appendix II). Salmonella is seen in horses but not commonly in cats and dogs. Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and Listeria Prevalence in Domestic Animals Campylobacter is of most concern in poultry, but is also seen in cattle and other livestock. In one study, 90% of broiler chicken farms tested positive, and in another 100% of broiler cecal droppings were positive. Based on multiple studies, 34% to 51% of dairy cows test positive for these pathogens, while one study showed beef cattle prevalence at 5% (see Table 16 in Appendix II). Many of the other animals including sheep, dogs, cats, and pigs are susceptible to Campylobacter infection, though subspecies of the pathogen not typically found in human patients may be implicated. Salmonella and Campylobacter are most common in poultry. USDA NRCS WFA Handbook 2016 18 Cryptosporidium parvum is known to infect cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, geese, chickens, and turkeys. Some Cryptosporidium species found in animals appear to be host-adapted and rarely infect humans. Listeria, most commonly found in ruminants (sheep, goats, and cattle), occasionally occurs in dogs, cats, pigs, poultry, and other species. However, only Listeria monocytogenes is considered a human pathogen of significance. Pathogen Vectoring by Domestic Animals Like wildlife, free-range livestock, escaped livestock, and companion animals (dogs, cats, etc.) may contaminate produce if they enter a field and defecate on the crop . Livestock and companion animals may transfer pathogens onto the crop through their saliva ( by eating a crop) or through manure-soiled feet. Contamination may also occur when inadequate time elapses between when feces is left by grazing animals gleaning harvested fields and harvest of the next crop. More rarely, contamination occurs when growers use animal traction (e.g., horses or oxen) to work the field. 2.5 Human Pathways While not the focus of this document, humans who do not take appropriate sanitar y measures before harvesting or handling produce may also contaminate it. Manure or other animal-based soil amendments brought onto the farm may create a direct pathway for pathogens. Humans may then unintentionally spread the pathogens if they do not change or wash boots after working with manure or animals, or properly clean produce-handling surfaces, equipment, and vehicles used to transport produce. Pathogen spread can be reduced if employees practice good hygiene, such as properly washing their han ds after using the restroom, and do not come to work sick. WFA Handbook 2016 19 Pathogen survival and growth depends on a number of biotic and abiotic factors. In general, pathogen numbers decline over time outside the host, usually with an initial steep decline followed by a small amount of lingering persistence, sometimes prolonged. Understanding this decline and recognizing the circumstances of the expected decline are critical elements of risk assessment and subsequent management in the produce growing environment. The major factors that influence pathogen r eduction are summarized below. Tables 17, 19, and 21 in the Appendix provide further details on how these factors influence pathogens, specifically in w ater, soil, and air, respectively. 3.1 Sunlight/UV Exposure UV radiation from the sun both dries and damages pathogens, typically leading to their quick reduction on the surfaces of soil, compost, manure, and leaves, as well as in clear, shallow water. Factors that compromise these beneficial actions \u2014shade from vegetation, turbid water, algal mats that cover water, depth in the soil and manure\u2014reduce the effectiveness of sunlight/UV exposure. Open orchard canopies foster sunlight/UV penetration to the orchard floor much more than dense, deeply shading canopies. Water without algae and suspended sediments fosters sunlight/UV penetration throughout the water column, but sunlight/UV only act as an effective biocide at shallow depths . Pathogens may also attach to macro-algae and persist both in the water and in dried mats on banks , riprap stones, or concrete. The effectiveness of sunlight/UV radiation in reducing pathogens in animal feces through heat and desiccation is related to the volume and surface a rea of the feces. For example, sunlight/UV radiation will reduce the total pathogen load in songbird feces faster than it will in cattle feces. 3.2 Predation/Competition/Antagonistic Microbial Interactions Diverse and abundant indigenous soil microbial populations generally decrease pathogen survival and reduce growth potential. Soil management practices that promote a robust native soil microbial community (e.g., high organic matter inputs from cover crops, manure, and compost; reduced tillage; infrequent fumigations) promote predation, competition , and antagonism. Laboratory work has demonstrated that pathogen survival time increases if native soil microbial communities are decreased through autoclaving or fumigation, although this relationship is not alw ays straightforward. Studies employing variable degrees of soil pasteurization commonly result in a corresponding inversely proportional effect of bacterial pathogen persistence: the more severe the treatment, the greater the pathogen survival. Management practices that reduce the complexity of native microbial communities (e.g., fumigation) may create conditions favorable for prolonged pathogen survival, particularly if pathogens are re-introduced to this microbiological \"vacuum\" of limited microbial commu nity density and diversity. Native microbial communities effective ly reduce pathogens in other media besides soil. Predation and competition for nutrients in water bodies is thought to reduce pathogen rates. Plants intercepting waterborne pathogens do so with the aid of biofilms, composed of microbial communities, which then help to reduce the pathogens. When biofilms form on the surfaces of leaves and roots, they may confer protection against pathogenic bacteria colonization, although in some instances, biofilms on plant surfaces may facilitate the survival and growth of pathogen populations. While predation, competition , and antagonism can play a significant role in enhancing food safety, they are insufficient for completely eliminating pathogenic contamination. 3: Environmental Factors That Influence Pathogen Reduction WFA Handbook 2016 20 3.3 Harborage/Symbiosis Although some biofilms may protect surfaces from pathogen colonization, others on living or inert surfaces\u2014such as soil, vegetation, water, water systems, algae, and sediments \u2014may serve as a reservoir for pathogens. While studies have proven the ability of many types of aquatic organisms to foster the survival of pathogens, the relative role of pathogens in water used for agriculture is currently unknown (see Section 2.1). Pathogenic bacteria and protozoans may persist in biofilms, somewhat protected from environmental stressors such as UV radiation and predation. In sediments, biofilms may facilitate the capture and retention of pathogenic bacteria on individual and/or flocculated particles suspended in the water columns as well as in settled sediments. Amoebas and other protozoans grazing on bacterial biofilms may consume bu t not kill pathogenic bacteria and harbor the pathogens, thereby allowing them to persist or amplify even in unfavorable environmental conditions. Evidence suggests that E. coli, Campylobacter, and Salmonella species may survive longer in a symbiotic relationship with algae, and in some circumstances their populations may amplify in association with algae. Nutrient-rich conditions that foster algal growth frequently occur in agricultural landscapes. Because algal blooms and algal mats may facilitate pathog en survival, management strategies should consider aquatic environments with abundant algae as possibly favorable habitat for extended pathogen survival. 3.4 Salinity, pH, and Nutrient Sources Food-borne pathogenic bacteria generally survive well on soil s with low salts and a neutral pH of around 6 or 7. Nutrients can support the growth of both pathogens and the microbes that compete with or predate upon them. Pathogens reduce more rapidly with low levels of bio -available carbon and nitrogen to consume, such as in clean water or sandy soils that typically contain less soil organic matter. The active area of the root zone that produces exudates can create a nutrient -rich environment for diverse microbial communities. For pathogens to survive, they have to c ompete with rival microbes for nutrients and avoid defensive antimicrobials produced by the plant. Different pathogens have different levels of ability to survive. 3.5 Temperature, Moisture , and Microscopic Niches Lower temperatures tend to extend pathogen survival in soil and water, as there is less competition from native microbial populations. Cloud cover and increased moisture associated with cooler times of the year may also contribute to pathogen survival, though higher temperatures and humidity may favor growth on suitable substrates, including crops. Freezing temperatures by themselves cannot be assumed to inactivate most pathogens ; however, rapid freeze-thaw cycles of weather can cause their reduction in the soil. Very high temperatures (> 55 oC/131oF), such as those found in thermophilic composting processes, reduce most pathogen populations with sufficient exposure time. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms. Depending on the circumstances they may reduce or promote pathogen survival. E. H. White, CDC WFA Handbook 2016 21 4.1 Dynamic Influences of Soil Pathogens Soil amendments of animal origin (e.g., manure, slurry, compost) serve as important soil fertility products for some growers, but may also serve as a pathway for produce contamination in the absence of appropriate management or treatment measures. Raw manure conveys higher risk than aged manure or finished compost. The application method (surface applied vs. incorporated) and environmental conditions at the time of applic ation influence pathogen survival and transport. Manure or other soil amendments exposed to a period of desiccation and UV radiation at the soil surface will have reduced pathogens present. Rainfall or irrigation events occurring shortly after manure application will likely release more pathogens. Manure composted using the full thermophilic process will carry reduced pathogen loads. As outlined in Section 3, many factors influence pathogen survival. Yet food-borne pathogen persistence in the soil and manure is still not well understood. Most studies are compartmentalized and do not look at the whole dynamic picture\u2014the fitness and virulence of pathogens, the interplay between indigenous microbes and pathogens, and the fixed features of soils, water sou rces, and climate. Many studies were conducted in labs, not in production fields. Even studies that do account for the majority of variables are only predictive of situations matching those same study conditions, not the entire scope of possible growing situations. Therefore it is difficult to accurately predict pathogen survival in the soil. 4.2 Range of Pathogen Persistence Food-borne pathogens, with the exception of Listeria , are not part of normal indigenous soil microbial communities, and so are not perfectly adapted to them. Table 4 shows that in some cases pathogens can be reduced quickly, and in others they can be present for over a year. In several studies, survival related to whether the soil was sterilized\u2014sterile soil lacks diverse populations of pathogen-suppressing microorganisms typically found in non-sterilized soil. Along these same lines, the presence of cover crops may influence the survival of indigenous soil microorganisms due to the support of increased microbial diversity. Different types of pathogens have different survival characteristics \u2014 Cryptosporidium oocysts typically persist outside of the host in soils or manure longer than bacteria. The type of the manure used, soil characteristics, and the rate of pathogens used for inoculati on also influence persistence. 4: Pathways and Persistence of Pathogens in Soils and Soil Amendments Thermophilic composting can reduce the number of pathogens in manure.

Pathogens present in such manure typically have genetic traits for antimicrobial resistance; wildlife feces may also carry pathogens with antimicrobial res istance. This resistance can transfer to soil microbes, increasing the risk of E. coli, Salmonella, and other bacteria with low virulence traits becoming a health hazard by complicating medical interventions. Microbes that do not infect healthy people can sicken people with compromised immune systems, and antimicrobial resistance makes any illness more difficult to treat. The use of resistance -related antibiotics during initial treatments may allow symptoms and infection to worsen. WFA Handbook 2016 24 Many produce growers employ conservation practices in their efforts to protect water, air and soil, as well as to support plants and animals. Understanding how some practices that contain vegetatio n, water or manure impact the fate and transport of pathogens is key in the co -management of food safety and conservation. Vegetation and water attract wildlife, and their presence near growing areas, while generally a low risk, may create co -management challenges. The text below and the supporting Tables in the Appendix (Tables 18, 20, and 22) describe how conservation practices may reduce pathogens in agricultural landscapes. 5.1 Water Management Practices That Encourage Pathogen Reduction Vegetation may influence the fate and transport of pathogens in surface and groundwater. By acting as a physical barrier to pathogens carried in fecal matter, contaminated soil, or debris in runoff, vegetation may prevent pathogens from moving down slope to crop production areas or surface waters. Organic matter in the soil, which supports diverse microbial populations that compete with and predate on pathogens, increases in the presence of vegetation. Soil structure and porosity also improves with vegetation, both of which increase water infiltration rates. The decreased pathogen presence and the improved infiltration reduce pathogen movement in surface runoff and to groundwater. Wetlands Constructed (NRCS Practice Standard 656), created (658), enhanced (659), and restored (657) wetlands may retain pathogens. Wetlands that allow water to move slowly through aquatic vegetation over long periods of time work best to decrease pathogen survival. Within the wetland, biotic and abiotic mechanisms \u2014 including predation, the release of antibiotics by other microbes, sedimentation, and multiple plant interactions \u2014 can contribute to pathogen reduction in water. Several explanations for the observation regarding the effect of vegetation have been offered: physical filtration, increased oxygen levels in the water column creating less favorable conditions for some pathogens, the presence of antagonistic rhizosphere interactions, adsorption of pathogens on biofilm- covered surfaces in contact with contaminated water. Root exudates of some aquatic plants may be toxic to some pathogens; conversely, these exudates may be a nutrient source to others. Better interception of pathogens occurs in a constr ucted wetland than in a natural one due to less channeling and more uniform filtration. However, v egetation in a uniformly constructed wetland may decrease UV penetration whereas in natural systems with patchy vegetation, more UV radiation exposure may occur. When the water levels fluctuate, more susceptibility to UV radiation and desiccation may also occur to pathogens retained on vegetation above the water line. Large flocks of migrating waterfowl, runoff from adjacent lands, access by wildlife or domesti cated animals, or other factors can cause water pollution in the wetlands at certain times of the year, possibly increasing pathogen loads and diminishing pathogen reduction mechanisms. 5: Conservation Prac tices That Influence the Reduction of Pathogens in Produce Wetlands can be used to intercept and reduce waterborne pathogens. USDA NRCS WFA Handbook 2016 25 Vegetative Buffer Strips Many livestock waste, pastureland, and riparian area studies have documented that vegetative buffers reduce bacteria and protozoan parasites. More recently, a study reported that vegetative buffers were important between produce farm operations and reservoirs of pathogens, such as livestock operat ions, ditches, and roads. A review of 40 vegetative treatment systems found that efficacy depends on a good stand of dense vegetation with strong fall growth and well-established winter vegetative cover to provide optimum filtration. Regularly harvesting and removing excess vegetation alleviates the build -up of dense thatch layers, which may provide a moist, cool environment for pathogen survival and in some cases amplification. Grazing should not be used as a harvest option since the animals may contribu te to the contamination. Uniform flow conditions are maintained by the prevention of channeling, and the traffic is minimized. Filter strips (393), grassed waterways (412) and riparian herbaceous buffers (390) may reduce movement of pathogens in runoff, although regular harvesting that removes excess vegetation may be required for them to function optimally and to allow for desiccation of the pathogens. Other vegetative buffers such as riparian forest buffers (391), tree and shrub establishments (612), field borders (386), vegetative barriers (601), and conservation covers (327) may also intercept pathogens in runoff. When these practices contain taller woody vegetation, the understory herbaceous vegetation is less thick because of diffused light and root competition, which results in less capacity to intercept pathogens. However, unlike the herbaceous only buffers, these other practices would not become too thick and require regular harvesting of thatch to reduce the moist, cool conditions that support pat hogen survival. Depending on the situation, it may be more appropriate to use vegetative buffers with woody vegetation, if regular harvesting is not possible. Riparian buffers are critical because they may offer the last chance to filter pathogens in agricultural runoff before it enters waterways. The natural vegetation can reduce the momentum of surface runoff and can trap debris with pathogens. Steep-sided riparian areas and those compromised by bank erosion may require extra wide buffers and/or vegetation with deep root systems to help stabilize banks and provide more opportunity for effective riparian filtration. Irrigation Water Waterborne pathogens can be reduced by other practices besides those involving vegetation. Crop fields with recently applied manure or unfinished compost may harbor pathogens in the soil. By using irrigation water management (449) techniques, the water is applied at rates that minimize pathogen transport to surface and ground water. Diversion The use of a diversion (362), placed at approximate right angles to the slope with a supporting ridge on the lower side to capture runoff, can direct upland contaminated runoff from entering a produce field. Diversions can also move water in agricultural waste systems. USDA NRCS Terraced diversions, like the one pictured above, help divert potentially contaminated runoff water away from crop fields. WFA Handbook 2016 26 Sediment Basin Sediment basins (350) help to trap sediments with attached pathogens in runoff, allowin g them to settle out before reaching a waterway. In situations where soils are very porous, water that contains pathogens may infiltrate from the basin to groundwater. Care must be taken with the placement of excess sediments removed during catch basin cleaning. Since pathogens need moisture, allowing the sediments to dry out before removing them may support pathogen inactivation, although extended survival of low or localized populations is possible. Waste Storage Pond A waste storage facility (313) can temporarily store wastes such as manure, wastewater, and contaminated runoff that might otherwise pollute the watershed. If not managed properly, these ponds can leak or overflow. 5.2 Airborne Management Practices That Aid in Pathogen Reduction As Table 2 pointed out, airborne material may include desiccated fecal matter with viable pathogen cells, or pathogens adhered to dust, soil, or debris. Mitigations used to minimize this \"fugitive dust\" may provide the additional benefit of reducing pathogen transf er via air. Dust Mitigation Practices Produce farms raising livestock in confined areas may need to reduce the generation of dust that could become a source of pathogens for crops. Air filtration and scrubbing (375) can help to capture fugitive dust particles in confined animal housing or other enclosed structures. Dust control for ani mals (371) can help to reduce particulate matter arising from animal activity on open lot areas, holding pens, corrals, working alleys, or other fugitive sources of particulate emissions. Practices can entail periodic manure harvesting and watering down areas of high animal activity. Managing animals on pasture with prescribed grazing (528) generates less dust and thus serves as an effective management tool to reduce the spread of pathogens. Vegetation That Intercepts Fugitive Dust Produce fields located close to livestock yards or adjacent to land with areas of high pathogen concentration (e.g., manure storage or uncovered compost) may benefit from vegetative barriers such as windbreaks (380), hedgerows (422), and riparian forest buffers (391) that intercept fugitive dust. Vegetative buffers can remove between 35% and 55% of downwind dust in the air. They work both by dropping particulate matter and by lifting dust into the upper air stream for greater diffusion. A preliminary study indicates that vegetative buffers similar to windbreaks significantly reduced the aerial transfer of pathogens between poultry houses. Use of plants not intended for human consumption reduces concern about the pathogens trapped in the plantings. When a vegetative buffer captures dust that contains pathogens, UV radiation may facilitate pathogen inactivation. Higher numbers of bacteria have been found on underside surfaces of leaves, suggesting UV radiation reduces survival on upper surfaces of leaves. J. A. Baumgartner In high wind situations, windbreaks surrounding the crop are sometimes needed to reduce the movement of fugitive dust . WFA Handbook 2016 27 Canopy structure and leaf area influence UV penetration into the vegetation and may influence the fate of pathogens intercepted by vegetation. Dust deposited on vegetation may itself desiccate the pathogens ; conversely, if enough moisture is present, it may serve to keep leaf surfaces moist and pathogens viable longer. Some evidence suggests that conifers work better than deciduous trees in high wind situations for providing dense foliage and interception. In the case of pesticide spray capture, the needle -like foliage of conifers captures two to four times more spray than broadleaves because the latter don't alter their leaf alignments in high winds. 5.3 Soil Management Practices That Influence Pathogen Reduction Nutrient Management Managing the amount, placement, and timing of manure applications through the nutrient management (590) practice helps to prevent harmful levels of pathogens from entering surface water and groundwater. Placing manure on fields that don't have significant runoff concerns, and limiting the amount of manure applied, reduces pathogen runoff. Thorough ly mixing manure with the soil may increase pathogen inactivation by exposing pathogens to desiccation, nutrient stress, and predation by native soil microbial populations, from which pathogens might be protected if they remain in intact clumps of manure. Incorporating manure into the soil immediately (via injection or tillage methods) to reduce scavenging bird and fly contact with the manure may reduce risk. When feasible, given crop needs and land use options, applying manure in warmer, drier months may facilitate more rapid pathogen reduction as pathogens tend to survive longer in cool, moist conditions. Application on frozen ground may increase risk of pathogen runoff and wild bird exposure. If a rain event that may create runoff and erosion is forecast, or if high winds that may cause the production of pathogen-laden particulate matter are predicted, delaying the application can reduce the transfer waterborne and airborne pathogens. Compost Incorporating compost fosters long periods of pathogen inactivation due to its long -term effect of increasing microbial diversity in the soil from its slow release of nutrients. The composting facility (317) documentation can help in the planning and making of compost, and in preventing pathogens in unfinished compost from moving onto adjacent crop fields through wind or surface water or from polluting the groundwater. Cover Crops and Crop Rotation The planting of many types of cover crops (340) can greatly increase the activity and diversity of microorganisms in the soil. As mentioned in Section 3.2, soil microbial diversity is a major factor in decreasing pathogens through competition, predation , and antagonism. Some do have an antimicrobial effect on various microbes, including pathogens\u2014for example, a mustard cover crop can reduce Salmonella pathogens. The use of conservation crop rotation (328) can also promote diverse soil microbial communities when organic matter is increased with high residue crops. Both cover crops and crop rotation can reduce dust and runoff that may contain pathogens f rom leaving the field. 5.4 Animal Management Practices That Help in Pathogen Reduction Integrated Pest Management (IPM) IPM (595) practices that use correctly placed raptor perches and owl boxes , rather than removing non- crop vegetation or using poison bait that may affect non-target animals, can help to reduce rodent populations that may carry pathogens. Management of refuge piles and other areas on the farm where rodents congregate, such as irrigation pipes stacked on ground, help to avoid population inc reases. Monitoring for rodents and other pests help to target suppression strategies that are used. WFA Handbook 2016 28 Wildlife Corridors Because terrestrial wildlife may be in the growing environment, strategic use of wildlife corridors can help draw animals away from crop fields and reduce food safety risk. Many types of wildlife prefer to move in non-crop vegetation that provides their native food and a cover from predators. Giving wildlife access to a vegetated corridor may keep them from traveling through a crop field where they may cause unacceptable damage. Prescribed Grazing Prescribed grazing (528) can benefit widespread food safety goals. Grazing management encourages water infiltration and reduces runoff, both important since livestock may shed pathogens. Instead of concentrating animal feces in confined yards, grazing animals disperse their feces on landscapes managed to have a filtering capacit y for any runoff that might make it to an irrigation source used by produce growers. The dispersed feces are also subject to the sun's desiccation and UV radiation , which inactivates pathogens. However, there is very limited data available to base predicti ons of persistence under a diverse set of crop/soil/animal scenarios. WFA Handbook 2016 29 Co-management of food saf ety and conservation objectives can be developed when keeping in mind what is known about pathogens and how they move and persist on the farm. Resource assessment and risk analysis are integral to farm planning. For optimum management, multiple barriers (blockades) reduce the number of pathogens transported in and ar ound the farm environment. The multiple-barrier approach focuses on preventing pathogens from (a) entering the farm, (b) contaminating the crop, (c) spreading from livestock operations to the crop, and (d) moving out to the wider landscape where they may lead to contamination. If one barrier fails, others prevent contamination of crops and water supplies. Many of the barriers mentioned below in Tables 5\u20148 are also depicted in Figure 2. Some of the management suggestions presented here, such as the value o f composting to reduce pathogens, are based on benefits observed in well-controlled research. Other insights come from the underlying understanding of functions known to affect pathogen fate and transport. For example, UV radiation can cause pathogen inactivation; therefore, practices that encourage the exposure of pathogens to sunlight and UV radiation may aid in reducing pathogen populations. It is understandable that growers must consider market factors when making co-management decisions . What works for a grower with one marketing outlet and a given set of regulatory pressures may not be acceptable to a grower in another set of circumstances. 6.1 Barriers That Intercept Pathogens at the Farm's Border NRCS Conservation Practice Standards (CPS) and Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) as shown in Table 5 are barriers that filter or divert contaminated water, intercep t fugitive dust and help control non- native wildlife at the farm's perimeter. While the CPS in the table are explained here and in the text of the three subsequent tables, GAPs are more fully described since CPS were covered in Section 5. I. Intercepting Waterborne Pathogens Vegetative buffer strips, diversions, and wetlands can be important management tools for intercepting waterborne pathogens at the farm's border. These conservation practices typically address runoff and flooding from livestock and wildlife waste, manured lands and manure stockpiles. II. Intercepting Particulate Matter with Pathogens Windbreaks and hedgerows placed along the farm's perimeter can intercept fugitive dust with pathogens blowing in from surrounding areas. This may be especially important when livestock are concentrated and manure is ground into the dust.

Discouraging Non -Native Feral Animals Deterring Feral Animals GAP IPM 595 17 6: Multiple -Barrier Approach to Minimizing Food Safety Risk on the Farm and in the Watershed WFA Handbook 2016 30 III. Discouraging Non-Native Feral Animals Deterring Feral Animals Wildlife on the farm is inevitable, and in some cases desired. However, excluding non-native invasive animal species from the farm is good for conservation as well as for food safety. Non-native invasive species are the second major reason for biodiversity losses worldwide, and they sometimes carry pathogens. Controlling invasive species populations not only reduces potential food safety risks, but also opens up space for native species to thrive. Various non-toxic Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies exist for controlling populations of European starlings, house sparrows, rock pigeons, and Norway rats. Hawks and other birds of prey frighten away pest birds. Supporting healthy populations of predatory birds by installing perches and nesting boxes at the farm's border, or hiring falconers to visit the farm, can help disperse pest birds. Food safety GAPs recommend that nest boxes and perches be placed in locations that will not pose a food safety liabili ty from bird droppings or leavings. Installing noisemakers and scare balloons may also frighten birds away. Placing food attractants in non-production edges of a farm may aid in keeping pests away from production fields. Food safety GAPs recommend controlling rodent populations. Attracting raptors as mentioned above, as well as supporting healthy populations of terrestrial predatory wildlife, can help reduce the rodents. Removing features that attract rodents \u2014brush piles, cull piles, puddles of standing water, and stacks of irrigation pipe\u2014will also help. Installing vegetative cover to replace weedy annuals abundant with seeds that rodents may prefer can discourage these animals. The use of traps instead of poison baits near drainages and waterways will prevent water pollution. Non-native feral pigs may present particularly challenging intrusion problems. Seeking out high -quality or favored food sources across broad territories, feral pigs may cause extensive damage by feeding on or trampling crops. They may also contaminate produce with their fecal matter. Food safety GAPs recommend trapping, hunting, or fencing feral pigs after obtaining proper permits. Temporary electrical fencing may dissuade less determined pigs, while short hog -wire fencing may be required in an area with a high population density. For added protection, running an electrified wire on the outside of the hog-wire fence, approximately 6 to 8 inches above the ground, may improve the fence's effectiveness. Feral pigs may travel up to 6 miles to reach a desirable forage opportunity. Close observation of movement patterns may help growers recognize food sources that attract feral pigs, allowing for efficient and effective fence placement. Hawks and other birds of prey can help to frighten away pest birds, as well as reduce rodent populations. J.A. Baumgartner WFA Handbook 2016 31 6.2 Barriers That Reduce Likelihood of Pathogens Contaminating Produce As shown in Table 6, there are many types of Conservation Practice Standards (CPS), conservation- related FDA Produce Rule requirements (FDA) and food safety Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) that help to reduce the possibility of crops becoming contaminated . I. Choosing Appropriate Sites Avoiding Nearby Contamination Food safety GAPs recommend that land use history and environmental risk factors be considered before planting a crop. Areas near chicken pasture operations, sites adjacent to grazing livestock (including small numbers of horses, goats, or other non-working farm animals), and high-impact areas near troughs or water sources may require special consideration for risk mitigation. Fields next to large concentrated feeding operations present a higher risk because of the amount of manure and increased soil compaction that results in higher runoff rates. Increased risk may also occur near landfills, manure storage sites, and exposed compost facilities. The degree of risk depends on the proximity of the crops to the high-risk site, slope and direction of water flow, wind patterns, and environmental loading rate (if any) for pathogens. Large numbers of birds or insects moving from contaminated areas into cropped areas also increase risk of pathogen contamination. Avoiding Frequently Flooded Land or Instituting a Waiting Period After Flooding Lands that flood are often considered a higher food safety risk than areas not susceptible to flooding. Food Safety GAPs recommend that the flooded ground undergo a waiting period before it is considered safe for replanting. Risk from deposited s ediment as well as saturation with waters of unknown quality are difficult to predict. FDA guidance, as well as many buyer guidances, cautions the use of flooded land without an adequate waiting period. Continual flooding may lead to lost productivity if a n area must remain out of production for an extended period of time. Planting Crops for Livestock Farms that grow both produce and animal feed can benefit from their operation 's diversity by planting crops destined for livestock in areas of higher risk f or pathogen contamination. For example, a grower who plans to plant hay or feed corn as well as produce will plant the livestock feed rather than fresh -cut leafy greens next to a neighbor's cattle pasture. Choosing the location with the lowest risk of contamination can be an effective risk management strategy when growing produce that will be eaten raw by consumers. Planting Fresh-cut Leafy Greens Away from Eroding and Sensitive Areas Produce buyers often perceive non-crop vegetation that may attract wild life on the farm as a serious food safety threat. However, in many cases, conservation practices and natural habitat may actually help keep wildlife out of crop fields by providing an area of preferred food and shelter. Despite this, many buyers still require that produce, especially fresh-cut crops such as salad mix, be separated from Table 6: Barriers That Reduce the Likelihood of Pathogens Contaminating Produce NRCS CPS/GAP CPS Code(s)/ GAP # in Fig. 2 I. Choosing Appropriate Sites Avoiding Nearby Contamination GAP 22 Avoiding Frequently Flooded Land or Instituting a Waiting Period After Flooding GAP 7 Planting Crops for Livestock GAP Planting Fresh -cut Leafy Greens Away from Eroding and Sensitive Areas GAP Avoiding Overhanging Vegetation GAP 20 Avoiding Areas with Abundant Wildlife GAP 21 WFA Handbook 2016 32 vegetative conservation practices and natural areas by bare -ground buffers, which incentivizes the removal of all non-crop vegetation. These requirements may pose significant challenges for on-farm conservation. The lack of non-crop vegetation in erosion-prone areas and along waterways with heavy nutrient and pesticide loading can cause significant impacts to the watershed. In some cases, configuring the crop fields so that roads serve as bare-ground buffers between crops and the conservation practice may satisfy food safety concerns. When markets demand the absence of conservation areas, planting the crop away from eroding and sensitive sites may alleviate some of the adverse impacts on soil, water, and wildlife resources. Avoiding Overhanging Vegetation Food safety GAPs recommend minimizing the risk of birds above row crops by reducing the likelihood that they will perch, roost, or feed in areas where their feces will fall on crops. Conservation practices that include trees, shrubs, or other vegetation may inadvertently attract and/or create perch areas for birds, thereby increasing the risk that birds will defecate into irrigati on canals or on the crops below. Risk of fecal contamination can be reduced by not planting (or harvesting) crops directly under established vegetation. Mechanically harvested crops, such as baby spinach and spring mix, may also need to avoid physical hazards (i.e., acorns, stems) that could be included in the bagged product. Selecting conservation plants that have an upright instead of branching growth form can help minimize the loss of adjacent production area. Installing large branching trees and fruit b earing plants attractive to birds a distance away from produce is another strategy to allow growers to balance conservation objectives with food safety risk management. Without non-crop vegetation, wild birds have been known to perch on anything they can find, including irrigation sprinklers positioned directly above the crop. Avoiding Areas with Abundant Wildlife Because wildlife is frequently drawn to vegetation and water, its presence in the farm landscape may create co-management challenges . Understanding how animals use these features, as well as how they move between conservation areas and crops , will help with co-management. Animal intrusion into crop fields can be significantly reduced by taking wildlife movement patterns into account when planning crop-planting locations. Avoiding disruption of wildlife corridors allows animals to travel to needed resources without having to traverse crop fields. Avoiding locations with nearby frog habitat reduces entry of frogs into fields. This is especially important with certain crops, such as fresh-cut leafy greens, that are machine-harvested using blades that are close to the ground and are not as careful at avoiding small animals as with hand- harvests. Taking wildlife movement patterns into account when delineating fields reduces the need for wildlife to traverse through crops . J.A. Baumgartner WFA Handbook 2016 33 II. Preventing Pathogens from Coming in Contact with Crops: a. Reducing Pathogens Through Animal Management Monitoring Animal Intrusion in the Crop FDA requires monitoring raw agricultural commodities during the growing season for significant evidence of potential contamination by domesticated and wild animals . Observation of significant numbers of animals, significant amounts of animal feces or significant crop destruction, determines how much of the crop can be harvested (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.83). Animal tracks, signs of feeding, and downed fencing all signal that animals have passed through. Monitoring the crop itself for these signs and responding help prevent or minimize potential crop contamination. Monitoring adjacent habitat is unnecessary since signs found there, are not an indication that animals are entering the crop. Many factors play into determinin g appropriate actions to reduce food safety risks to the crop, including how long and with what frequency they enter the crop (Are they rushing through and eating a little or staying awhile and eating a lot? Has their presence been noted once or several times?); the purpose of their visit (Are they there because of food? Is this a movement corridor to water or food, including other crops or prey? Do they live next to the crop?); and when they are seen in relation to crop production schedules (Were they just seen before planting or did they appear right before harvest?). Monitoring may be especially important when factors such as drought or post-fire conditions lead to increased animal movement into crops. FDA requires growers to use identifying measures where contamination of raw agricultural commodities occurs during the growing season so that later during harvest, that part of the crop is excluded (FDA Produce Rules \u00a7 112.83 and \u00a7112.112). Food safety GAPs recommend placing a no-harvest buffer around any contamination source in the field. No-harvest buffers are commonly established in operations, including those under the Leafy Green Marketing Agreement. Farm employees walk the fields and mark animal tracks and evidence of feeding or trampling, with the assumption that fecal contamination may be present but undetectable without extensive testing. Sometimes bare-ground buffers are used for easy monitoring of wildlife tracks, although these areas Table 6 (continued) NRCS CPS/ FDA/ GAP CPS Code(s)/ FDA/ GAP # in Fig. 2 II.

It is common practice to use wire field flags of a specified color to mark off the no -harvest area, so workers harvesting the crop can easily identify them. The area of the buffer depends on many factors, such as whether feces landed nearby or contacted the crop, the size and type of the feces, whether rain or irrigation water has created a splash zone, and whether the harvestable portion of the cro p grows close to the soil. Some GAPs recommend flagging a 5-foot radius around the contaminated area. Harvesting the Crop FDA requires growers conduct a visual assessment for contamination immediately prior to and during harvest of raw agricultural commodities (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.112). For crops such as tree fruit and bush berries that do not have the harvestable portion close to the ground, FDA requires that fruit with bird or other animal damage, or fruit on the ground, not be harvested (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.114). Deterring Wildlife If monitoring detects significant wildlife intrusion in the crop, actions will need to be taken. Many of the same non-toxic Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies used on non -native feral animals can be used for native wildlife. In addition, silt fencing may deter some types of small native wildlife such as ground squirrels and rabbits, which typically do not climb or enter something they cannot see over or through. Sprinklers activated by motion detectors, flashing red lights sensed as eyes, and judicious use of fencing may keep out larger wildlife. If fencing is deemed necessary, it should avoid obstructing wildlife corridors as much as possible, or should be placed around the crop fields rather than around the whole farm. Frogs may present challenges for growers producing loose-headed lettuce or machine-harvested tender greens and tender-leaf culinary herbs. Some buyers suggest silt fencing around the perimeter of the crop to dissuade frog entry, but this strategy does not appear effective for fields immediately adjacent to water. As mentioned above, locating those crops away from frog habitat may reduce seasonal frog intrusion. Some growers use copper sulfate to eliminate tadpoles in water bodies , and even though it is typically used at low application rates to control algae growth in water bodies , it is not labeled as an amphibian control product. Amphibians are in decline worldwide due to a multitude of challenges. b. Reducing Pathogens Through Water and Particulate Matter Management Vegetative practices both within the farm and on the farm's border can function as valuable barriers in protecting crops from waterborne and airborne contamination. On slopes that receive fresh applications of manure, vegetative terraces can reduce the runoff of contaminated water by allowing water to pond and infiltrate the soil. Diversions can catch and redirect the water away from the crop. Contaminated runoff flow ing through grassed waterways may be filtered by the vegetation, and captured by sediment basins. Vegetative buffer strips adjacent to fields can intercept waterborne pathogens. Taller conservation plantings can intercept fugitive dust from compost and manure storage areas. Taking into account topography and prevailing wind patterns can help determine optimal placement of vegetation. USDA NRCS FDA Produce Rule requires that irrigation water meet specified water quality standards for raw agricultural commodities . WFA Handbook 2016 35 Ensuring Adequate Water Quality FDA has a strict requirement that no generic E. coli be present in water for certain uses, such as when it is applied during or after the harvest. However, FDA's requirement for irrigation water that touches raw agricultural commodities during their growth is less strict. The frequency of generic E. coli testing depends upon whether surface or groundwater is used for irrigation. Treatment may be determined necessary, depending on the results. Growers using public water systems need to obtain records that the water is safe (FDA Produce Rules \u00a7 112.43 - \u00a7 112.46). Streams, ponds, and basins that are managed to encourage clear water may allow more UV penetration, which may reduce pathogens. Maintaining low turbidity conditions may be important in areas with high pathogen inputs, such as locations where animals may contaminate water bodies. Low tur bidity has the additional benefit of lessening the sediment load that could extend pathogen survival. Wildlife drinking from clean water sources will not pick up pathogens to spread later. Conservation planners can help growers with irrigation management to produce less runoff. They can also help develop a well -balanced nutrient management plan to reduce nutrient loads in drainage water systems. Together these management strategies decrease sediments and algae growth, which may support pathogen survival. c. Reducing Pathogens Through Soil Management Waiting Between Manure Application and Next Harvest While incorporating manure and other biological soil amendments containing pathogens in agricultural soils provides valuable fertility input, they may also present contamination risk. Food safety GAPs recommend and the USDA National Organic Program requires a waiting period between manure application and the next harvest to give the soil's indigenous microbial community time to inactivate pathogens. At this time, FDA does not require a waiting period, but they plan to in future after detailed research is conducted. Nutrient management strategies that reduce the risk of using manure include managing the amount, incorporating it quickly and thoroughly, and timing applications based on season and predicted rainfall or high winds. Applying Manure and Compost Near the Crop FDA has a strict requirement that raw manure be applied in a manner that does not contact raw agricultural commodities during application, and minimizes the potential for contact after application. However, the agency only requires that compost be applied in a manner that minimizes t he potential for contact during and after application (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.56). Using Compost FDA requires that aerobic conditions are fostered in compost and that it heats up to a minimum temperature during production (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.54). When compost is made on the farm, specified composting procedures should be followed and documented. When purchased from a supplier, the compost should come with a certificate guaranteeing that process used is scientifically valid (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.60). The use of the compost facility practice can help to keep the raw manure feedstuff, and the compost itself, from polluting air and water resources. Composted manure is an excellent alternative to raw manure. To ensure that it heats up correctly, compost should have adequate moisture, a proper carbon to nitrogen ratio, and regular turning if not managed as a static pile. During the heating process, high temperatures must be reached to reduce pathogens, but the compost should not get so hot that it kills of f the compost's indigenous microbial community. This community helps to mitigate the growth of pathogens, should they be reintroduced. Adding compost to soil also supports soil conditions favorable for microbial populations, which in turn keep pathogen populations in check. WFA Handbook 2016 36 Manure is considered a riskier compost feedstock, given that it is likely to contain pathogens. Non - manure compost feedstocks, such as green waste, may be less likely to contain pathogens. Caution should still be used, as it is possible for green waste to become contaminated with fecal material. Green waste may also contain other types of hazards, such as broken glass or heavy metals. Some produce buyers will not purchase crops grown on fields amended with raw manure. California's Leafy Green Marketing Agreement suggests a one-year waiting period between application of soil amendments with raw manure and the next crop. In these cases, growers may need to use non-manure- based soil fertility practices, such as nitrogen -fixing cover crops and non-manure-based composts. Events that might introduce pathogens into a field include grazing, applying raw manure, spreading dredged sediments, flooding, or extensive fecal contamination by intruding animals. Planting cover crops after a contamination event allows for a longer waiting period between the contamination and the harvest of the next crop, giving more time for pathogen inactivation. This is especially important for higher risk crops such as fresh-cut leafy greens. A rotation of a low -risk crop (crops typically cooked or pasteurized before they are eaten) can also lengthen the time for pathogen die off. Cover crops and crop rotations limit the movement of pathogens in runoff water. Like compost, cover crops and rotations with high-residue crops increase soil organic matter and support robust soil microbial communities that may selectively exclude pathogens through predation, antagonism, and competition. Managing Contaminated Crop Sites When a large section of a crop is contaminated (e.g., th rough flooding or feces from a herd of feral pigs), it may be necessary to destroy that part unharvested. Since research suggests that pathogens may survive in the soil environment for an extended length of time following the incorporation of crop residues, mowing or undercutting the crop and allowing for desiccation of the plant material prior to disking and incorporation may allow for a reduction of pathogens. When a small amount of feces is found in the crop, after being cordoned off, as mentioned above , the feces is removed and disposed of out of the field or it is buried deeply. Fostering Pathogen Desiccation in Soils and Sediment in Basins Desiccation of pathogens contained in or on soil is a process that lends itself to management control. Allowing a crop field to fallow during the warm part of the year to dry out soils can reduce pathogen viability. Likewise, allowing sediment basins to dr y as completely as possible provides pathogen control benefits. The design of a sediment basin can help drop sediments out of the water before they reach the main basin/pond. Designs that include a runway with a slight elevation decrease that is periodical ly cleaned out can have this effect. Trapping sediments in the runway makes them more susceptible to desiccation than if they fall out in the main basin. It also reduces sediment loads in the larger body of water. Although inactivation of pathogens may be hastened by drying periods, finer textured clay may retain sufficient water to support pathogen survival and may require more management to mitigate potential risk. Short intervals of wet/dry cycling may accelerate pathogen reduction in some soils. In situations where produce buyers will not purchase crops grown near non-crop vegetation because of the perceived threat of wildlife as significant food safety risks, water quality and soil erosion are concerns. The use of sediment retention basins to capture s ediment and other contaminants before water is discharged to waterways can mitigate where significant areas of soil are bare. Since sediment basins themselves may be perceived to attract wildlife, developing an understanding of wildlife movement patterns around the site, and choosing vegetation to deter animal presence, can help. Depending on the wildlife present in the area, short vegetation in the sediment basin tends to dissuade mice, while tall vegetation tends to deter geese. WFA Handbook 2016 37 6.3 Barriers That Reduce Spreading Pathogens to Produce When Livestock Are on the Farm The barriers shown in Table 7 can help to decrease the spread of pathogens to crops in diverse farm production systems that raise both crops and livestock. I. Livestock in and Near Production Areas Avoiding Contamination Placin g food and water sources, as well as other features around which livestock generally congregate, away from produce fields may help reduce the proximity of potential contamination sources to crop boundaries. Prescribed grazing can optimize infiltration and reduce runoff of water that may contain pathogens. Waiting Between Fecal Deposits and the Next Crop Animals that have access to crop production areas\u2014livestock included as part of a pasture/crop rotation schedule or allowed to graze crop residues prior to the next planting\u2014provide nutrients for crops while receiving sustenance. FDA Produce Rule recommends, but does not require, a waiting period between fecal deposits and the harvest of the next crop, given that pathogen reduction in the soil takes time. Managing Working Animals FDA requires that when animals are part of the operation, such as growers using animal traction, guard dogs or weeder geese, standard risk assessment and management practices be developed to control contamination risk of the raw agricultural commodity and water sources (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.134). These may include ensuring that no feces are deposited in the crop field after the crop has been planted, keeping animals distant from the crop, and avoiding moving animals through a production area close to harvest time. II. Decreasing Pathogens Through Air and Water Management When animals are confined in an area for any length of time, practices can be used to reduce fugitive dust and runoff containing pathogens. Ensuring Adequate Water Quality FDA does not allow water from an animal waste storage pond be used to irrigate raw agricultural commodities (FDA Produce Rule \u00a7 112.42). This water is best used on crops grown for livestock. Table 7: Bar riers That Reduce Spreading Pathogens to Produce When Livestock Are on the Farm NRCS CPS/GAP CPS Code (s)/ FDA/ GAP # in Fig. 2 I.

Restricting Wild and Feral Animal Movement Between Livestock Areas and Crops Controlling Animals GAP IPM 595 17 WFA Handbook 2016 38 III. Restricting Wild and Feral Animal Movement Between Livestock Areas and Crops Controlling Animals Animals that feed on livestock manure, or on the insects and seed fou nd in it, may pick up pathogens. For this reason, food safety GAPs recommend that measures be taken to reduce the presence of these animals with access to produce fields. This recommendation also assumes that animal control measures will take place only af ter obtaining any local, state, or federal environmental permits. IPM and other practices mentioned previously can be used to ensure that certain species of birds, rats, or feral pigs do not serve as mechanical vectors, tracking fecal matter from livestock feces, bedding, food, or water sources to crops or farm equipment. Tracking movement patterns and behavior of these animals can help land managers assess risk. Birds that are attracted in large numbers to a livestock operation for feed and water, who then perch on irrigation sprinklers or the crop itself, present a risk that must be managed. 6.4 Barriers That Prevent Pathogens from Leaving the Farm In Table 8, the conservation practices shown can help to restrict pathogens from moving off the farm. I. Intercepting Waterborne Pathogens Many of the conservation practices that reduce the movement of pathogens onto the farm or into produce fields can also be used to ensure that pathogens don't leave the farm to contaminate the larger landscape. Just as a wetland high up in the watershed can help to clean water before it reaches the farm, one may also help to treat runoff before it leaves the farm to possibly contaminate surface waters downstream. Sediment basins may function as one of the last barriers to capture pathogens in runoff on a farm that is not on a waterway, and riparian buffers make the last stand at reducing pathogens from entering streams. In this way, pathogen contamination risk reduction is practiced throughout produce production systems.

USDA NRCS WFA Handbook 2016 39 7.1 Produce Food Safety Plans and Audits It has become common practice for buyers to request food safety plan s from the farms where they purchase produce. A food safety plan is the documentation and rationale of the management strategies a farm will take to address f ood safety risks. Major elements of any farm food safety plan include the personal hygiene of people on the farm, water purity and testing, use of soil amendments, land use history, neighboring issues, wild and domestic animals, and harvest. Food safety plans aid growers in proactively identifying and addressing food safety concerns to avoid making anyone sick. Food safety plans are recommended, but not required by the FDA Produce Rule. Using the multiple barriers approach, conservation practices and GAPs are identified to address food safety risk on the farm and then translated into actions in the food safety plan \u2014for instance, installing a diversion to redirect pathogen-laden water running off a livestock area so it does not contaminate a crop field, monitoring the diversion periodically, and taking corrective actions when necessary. These steps, along with the rationale that supports them, are written down in the food safety plan. Many buyers also require a third-party food safety audit done either by a specific food safety auditor or by one chosen by the grower. If a grower sells to certain handlers, such as those in the Leafy Green Marketing Agreement, a third-party audit conducted by a specific government agency can be mandatory. The USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) offers food safety audits, as do some states. Many private auditing companies exist as well. Each auditing entity usually has a very specific checklist of GAPs and makes general observations. The purpose of the auditor's visit is to verify that the risk mitigation steps identified in the food safety plan are actually taken. Growers who fail to address mitigation steps or the record keeping identified in the plan lose points during the audit, resulting in mandated corrective actions. Losing too many points or having a critical major non -compliance will result in a failed audit. The USDA AMS food safety audit, Harmonized GAPs (United Fresh Produce Association), and several other audit programs do not deduct points for the presence of non-crop vegetation near produce fields. However, the auditors of some food safety buyers will not allow a crop to be located near non -crop vegetation because of the perceived threat of wildlife intrusion. These buyers do not understand or do not accept current evidence about how conservation practices may help reduce food safety concerns. Growers can effectively advocate for their farming practices with food safety auditors by using risk assessment strategies outlined in the multiple-barrier approach and by explaining their rationale for management decisions that address those risks. Conservation planners can assist growers by providing them with records of conservation practices that they helped plan or install. These records are documentation of expert conservation actions and do not constitute recommendations for food safety compliance by conservationists. Records can be kept with their food safety plans to show to their produce buyers, who in turn specify the acceptable audit scheme. In addition to records, growers can provide their auditors with co-management training scenarios developed specifically for food safety auditors. These scenarios help 7: Converting Co -Management Knowledge to Action Conservation planners can give growers records of conservation practices, such as a hedgerow or windbreak, so they can include them in their food safety plan. S. Earnshaw WFA Handbook 2016 40 explain how conservation practices work to address food safety concerns on farms or give examples of how auditors could respond to different risk situations. Two resources available are: The University of California's Introduction to Auditor Resource Materials , and Wild Farm Alliance's Training Scenarios for USDA and Third Party Auditors on the Co-Management of Food Safety and Conservation as Well as Small- and Mid-Size Farm Concerns. The latter publication offers USDA auditors continuing education units since many of them are not familiar with co -management concepts. These materials help growers address food safety without sacrificing responsible on-farm conservation measures. 7.2 Top Co -Management Concerns In the preamble to FDA's Produce Rule, FDA states \"We continue to encourage the co -management of food safety, conservation, and environmental protection.\" Fostering public health is nothing new for conservation. Protecting natural resources and providing clean air and water thereby supports public health objectives. What has changed is the national focus on food safety and the perceived conflicts between wildlife habitat and food safety requirements. Awareness, understanding, and management of on-farm food safety concerns in conjunction with conservation practices are evolving. Some buyers and food safety auditors who would formerly reject crops near conservation practices are now learning more about the value of conservation. Resource planners who assist growers in managing conservation practices with food safety in mind , and the growers themselves, are helping to change that, but challenges still remain. While the food safety and conservation co-management strategies detailed in this document focus on pathogen reduction measures, not complete elimination strategies, they help growers reduce the risk of pathogen contamination in their produce. Fundamental Co-Management Steps to Be Taken for Produce Grower: 1. Strategically selects crop and field location. 2. Monitors for wild and domestic animals in crop field. Conservationist assists grower in developing a plan for: 3. Reducing pathogens through water management. 4. Decreasing fugitive dust with pathogens through particulate matter management. 5. Diminishing pathogens through soil and manure management. 6. Lessening contamination through animal management. Grower: 7. Determines what other requirements need to be implemented , such as further controlling wildlife and domestic animals, ensuring manure applications don't touch the crop, and water testing. 8. Develops a food safety plan that incorporates co -management of food safety and conservation practices and actions. The overwhelming majority of food-borne illnesses do not originate on the farm, but rather from any one of many sources or points along the supply-chain from farm to food preparation. This handbook provides an understanding of the fate and transport of food -borne pathogens and offers a systematic way to check for and address possible on-farm food safety concerns related to conservation. There is still much unknown in terms of looking at food safety from a reductionist perspective of single factors to seeing it from a holistic one. In general it is understood that conse rvation plays a vital role in farm production, food safety, and ecosystem functions. Farms that grow produce can manage for food safety and conservation without compromising natural resources. WFA Handbook 2016 41 Enteric bacteria naturally live in the healthy gut of animals and people and are necessary for good digestive health. Some enteric bacteria are pathogenic and if ingested may lead to gastrointestinal illness and, in some extreme cases, to life changing or fatal medical complicatio ns. This appendix focuses on four such Cryptosporidium species, which may also lead to severe gastrointestinal illness. These pathogenic bacteria are most likely to contaminate U.S. produce from non- human sources (i.e., animals, water, soil, air). While the protozoan does not cause as many food -borne illnesses, it was included because of its unique survival strategy. The discussion that f ollows focuses on understanding attributes of each pathogen that may influence its fate and transport in the growing environment. Escherichia coli species are present in the healthy animal gut and are frequently used as an indicator species to determine if fecal contamination has occurred. There are several types of pathogenic E. coli, among them Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, which may lead to severe and life-threatening Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a disorder that occurs when the infection produces Shiga toxins that destroy red blood cells, causing kidney damage. Depending on the specific clinical symptoms of a patient's illness, an infectious pathogenic E. coli may be classified as a subset of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli\u2014 namely Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Other pathotoxigenic E. coli that do not cause HUS may also pose a serious risk to human health. Among the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, E. coli O157:H7 is a frequently identified strain in ill patients in the United States. However, numerous other strains may also be of human health concern and have been implicated in large outbreaks. Discussion of Shiga toxin -producing E. coli in this document is based on research that is predominantly focused on E. coli O157:H7, as this is the most frequently studied strain in the United States. Different strains of pathogenic organisms have been found to persist and behave differently both in the host and in the environment, so it is important to realize that more than one Shiga toxin-producing E. coli exists and all have unique characteristics that impact their virulence, survival, and multiplication. Survival Outside the Host Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobactor, and Listeria bacteria are well adapted to survive in the moist, anaerobic intestinal environments of their hosts, but all may survive outside their host as well. The protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium is likewise capable of surviving outside a host, and in fact may persist longer due to its ability to form an oocyst, a thick -walled spore that may survive for long periods of time. The oocyst may resist damage from environmental stressors such as desiccation, freezing, and scarce nutrient supplies more readily than bacterial cells. Survival times for pathogenic organisms outside of the host are highly variable and subject to environmental conditions as well as to specific characteristics of the pathogen. Variable Expression of Traits Several pathogens of human health concern have the ability to express a range of traits related to motility, virulence, and toxin production, among other factors. This variability impacts both direct human health risk and risk associated with patho gen survival outside of the host. For example, Listeria monocytogenes commonly occurs in the soil as saprophytic bacteria in decaying organic matter. When presented with certain environmental stressors, certain forms of L. monocytogenes may express varying traits influencing virulence, from wide-spread soil bacteria posing little human health concern to Appendix I: Pathogens of Concern WFA Handbook 2016 42 pathogenic bacteria capable of causing serious illness or death. L. monocytogenes can resist desiccation and grow in a wide range of temperatures and adverse conditions. E. coli bacteria also have a range of virulence factors that may or may not be active, leading to challenges in identifying risk presented by strains of the bacteria identified in the environment. For example, E. coli may carry but not express the genetic code to produce Shiga toxins. Resistance to Antimicrobials Antimicrobial resistance of pathogens is a human health concern because it is not only found in livestock and in soils with manure, but has also spread to wildlife. This resistance can be transferred among many types of soil microbes and can increase the risk of E. coli, Salmonella, and other bacteria with low virulence traits becoming a health hazard. Antimicrobial resi stance makes any illness more difficult to treat. People with compromised immune systems, such as the young and the elderly, are particularly vulnerable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and World Health Organization (WHO) have recognized that human health and economic implications of resistance vary widely depending on antibiotics and pathogens of concern, and have concluded that feeding certain antibiotics to livestock for production purposes, to promote growth or increase feed efficiency, poses a public health problem. Tables 9\u201413 give basic information about the pathogens considered in this document, including information about why each is considered important in food safety risk assessment i n produce.

WFA Handbook 2016 45 Evolving methodologies in collecting, analyzing , and reporting data, and the difficulties inherent in interpreting research results make precise risk analysis difficult. Nevertheless, the data are a useful element of risk analysis used to guide management decisions . The discussion of livestock and wildlife pathogen sources in Appendix II is not meant to be all encompassing, but rather to show the diversity of studies mainly occurring in the U nited States. The current food-borne pathogen data on animals around the country and the world reflect snapshots of research in a range of settings and animal populations, rather than comprehensive understanding of pathogens in the environment, because thorough study is very difficult and expensive. Research has focused on assessing relationships between human illnesses and livestock , between human illnesses and wildlife, and increasingly on how wildlife and livestock may share pathogens. Wildlife science literature has also examined pathogens found in animal feces through wildli fe surveys, and to a lesser extent how pathogens influence wildlife mortality rates. Before reviewing the information from current pathogen prevalence data, it is helpful to understand what the data measure, how they are collected, and their limitations. Pathogen loading rate, prevalence, and sampling challenges Environmental loading rate of pathogens on the landscape is the most useful information for food safety risk analysis. It considers not only prevalence (percent of an animal population sampled that tests positive for a pathogen), but also the amount of pathogens per gram of an animal's feces, the amount of feces excreted per day by each animal, and population density. This type of data is currently scarce for wildlife species in particular. Prevalence data in this Appendix show percent of samples in which the target pathogen was found. Many studies have small sample sizes, and caution must be used when inferring risk from these small sample size prevalence rates; both 1/10 and 100/1000 positi ve test results will yield a prevalence rate of 10%, but the latter may provide more insight into environmental load of the pathogen and risk from the animal in question. Interpretation of data may be further complicated by the fact that total population s ize is often unknown, so it is not possible to know how well the population has been represented in any sample size. Unless samples are collected directly from the animal, it is not clear whether each fecal sample reflects an individual or one of multiple samples from a single individual. Samples collected from an animal's gut, mouth, skin , and blood are more reliable than feces collected from the ground, where they may have been contaminated by other animal, wind , or water pathways. Studies often only determine presence or absence instead of quantifying the amount of pathogen. Ease of pathogen detection increases with larger animals because ample samples may be collected from large fecal deposits. Animal stress, age and immunity, and habitat Seasonal stress of some animals may result in the variability of pathogen shedding rates. Resistance to some diseases, such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium, may increase as the animal host ages, perhaps due to immunity that is built from past exposur e. If an area has a high background level of pathogens in the environment, animals in that region may reflect a similarly high pathogen load. Appendix II: Prevalence of Pathogens in Wild and Domestic Animals WFA Handbook 2016 46 Young animals tend to shed more pathogens than adults; for example, calves shed more than cows. Human pathogens versus animal pathogens Improvements in pathogen testing methods now allow DNA fingerprinting to precisely identify pathogen serotypes implicated in human illness. Earlier work did not have this ability, and may have inaccurately identified certain organis ms as pathogens of human concern, though it is now known they are adapted to specific animal hosts and present little risk to humans. This may be particularly relevant for pioneering Cryptosporidium studies. Thus, it is important to understand the methodology when reviewing literature or developing new research programs. Conversely, while some Salmonella studies report that pathogens are uniquely adapted for animal hosts, more recent work suggests they are also capable of infecting humans. Thus, unique adaptation to animal hosts does not exclude the possibility of human virulence unless research has speci fically investigated that aspect. Many pathogen studies report all strains that may be able to infect humans, even in the absence of epidemiological studies showing that they have made people sick. This may be occurring in part because the pathogens may be evolving faster than research can identify them. Pathogen presence, degree of activity, and fitness Before improved recovery and detection technologies and DNA fingerprinting, some studies may have under-reported pathogen presence. Other pathogens have been under-reported because of physician sampling, lack of illness reporting by sick people, lack of use of reporting systems, and pathogen sub -types not being included on mandated public health reporting lists. Modern genetic testing procedures determine if presumptive virulence gene(s) or a diagnostic pathogen marker gene(s) is (are) present, not if it is alive, in an inactive state, or dead. Non -viable pathogens, and/or remnant DNA of pathogens that were previously present, do not present risk, though they may help scientists understand pathogen pathways. In environmental samples, due to the low abundance, an enrichment step is generally required prior to detection, which virtually assures viability in PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests. This is often followed by cultural confirmation. Differential fitness among pathogens in competition with different background microbiota present in a sample can also impact pathogen growth sufficient to allow molecular detection and/or culturability. A.II. 1 Preva lence of Pathogens in Wildlife Figures 4\u20147 present a snapshot of prevalence data in a range of animals from documented wildlife studies. The data were selected for inclusion if the animals were in the U nited States; the number of animals sampled was at least 25; the samples were taken from the animal itself , not off the ground; the animals did not die of a disease; and the animals were not farm-raised or in a zoo. This data may or may not mean that populations of the same species in other areas will show similar percentages of pathogens. Pathogen prevalence data is an area of active research, with increasing emphasis on collecting companion data to facilitate better understanding of environmental loading rates and pathogen pathways in the landscape. E. coli Pathogen Sources Prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 pathogens in native and non-native feral animals in the United States is depicted in Figure 4. The animals were in association with cattle in all but four of the studies (c, d, g, and p). No black-tailed deer in California coastal counties or white -tailed deer in Texas were found with E. coli pathogens, even though cattle and sheep were detected with the pathogens in the latter study. White-tailed deer in Louisiana and in the northeastern and southern states were found with a low E. coli WFA Handbook 2016 47 pathogen prevalence, as were cattle in the south, although the E. coli had different genes encoding Shiga toxins. Other deer studies reporting animals without E. coli pathogens in California, and with them in Idaho, Kansas, and Nebraska were not shown in Figure 4 because of unacceptable data collection parameters. A link between pathogenic E. coli illnesses, strawberry consumption, and deer feces found on an Oregon strawberry farm was made with DNA fingerprinting techniques (see Table 3 Recorded Outbreaks Associated with Wildlife). E. coli pathogens were also found in a few coyotes, tule elk, and a deer mouse (see Figure 4), but not in other rodents or various other wildlife (opossums, rabbits, skunks, ground squirrels, mice, or raccoons) in California Coast farmlands and rangeland. No E. coli pathogens were found in rodents in dairies and cattle feedlots in the Northwest. Links between rodents and cattle have been established in European studies. E. coli strains with multiple antimicrobial resistances were detected in wild rodents originating from areas with high livestock density in Germany, suggesting a possible transmission from livestock to wild rodents. Feral pigs were found with E. coli pathogens in California Coastal Counties in three studies (Figure 4), one of which also detected prevalence in about one -third of the cattle present. Although the definitive source of E. coli O157:H7 in the California 2006 spinach outbreak was never determined, feral pigs, cattle, pasture soil, water, and sediments were suspected. These non-native pigs may share the pathogens directly with the cattle, or indirectly through contaminated water a nd soil. Because they tend to preside in riparian areas and exist in high populations in this region, they may increase the spread of these pathogens through waterways. Numerous bird species that frequent feedlots and farms with livestock have been found positive for food-borne pathogens, leading to speculation about the role of birds in the transfer and dissemination of this pathogen from livestock. Eight of the studies (Figure 4: a, f, j, k, l, m, n, o) looking at birds were conducted at cattle feedlots, dairy farms, or on rangeland and nearby produce fields to determine if birds acted as a significant carrier of E. coli pathogens, and two of those studies established that antibiotic resistance had developed in the pathogens found. European starlings near an Ohio dairy farm were found with E. coli O157, while those near a Kansas cattle feedlot were not in one study but were in another. One pigeon tested positive for E. coli O157 near a Wisconsin dairy farm, but the European starlings, sparrows, or turkeys also present did not. Rock pigeons near Colorado dairy farms were not found with E. coli pathogens, but E. coli virulence characteristics were detected. In California cattle ranches and nearby produce fields, American crows and brown-headed cowbirds were found with E. coli pathogens, but a large number of bird species (perching birds and wild geese) tested negative for E. coli pathogens in this region. Tundra swans tested negative for E. coli pathogens in Alaska. E. coli antibiotic resistance was reported in the gut flora of natural populations of Yellow-headed blackbirds in North Dakota (not shown). Birds that frequent farms with livestock have been found to test positive for pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella . USDA APHIS WFA Handbook 2016 48 Figure 4 does not show invertebrate data. Of all the invertebrates, flies are most often associated with spreading diseases, especially since they are attracted to manure as a food source and developmental site, and can contaminate animal and human food through regurgitation, fecal deposition, or mechanical transfer. Flies collected at Midwestern state agricultural fairs where livestock were exhibited were found with E. coli pathogens. In Kansas, house flies in a cattle feedlot were found to carry antibiotic resistant E. coli pathogens, which they passed on to cattle, causing the researchers to conclude that flies play a role in disseminating the pathogen among animals and the surrounding environment. In California, flies were found to carry multiple strains of E. coli pathogens and may be able to transfer viable cells to spinach leaf surfaces. On the other hand, black soldier fly larvae were found to reduce the incidence of E. coli in dairy manure. Other kinds of invertebrates have been the subject of E. coli pathogen tests. Slugs in a Scottish sheep ranch were found to carry E. coli pathogens. While bees weren't tested, a study showed how they tended to avoid flowers inoculated with E. coli pathogens. Bee propolis has toxicity factors that reduce survival of those pathogens that might make it to the hive. Figure 4: Percent of U.S. Native & Non -Native Mammal Colon and Avian Cloacal Swab/Tissue Samples with E. coli 0157:H7 Pathogens From: et al. 2011; (b) Branham et al. 2005; (c) Dunn et al. 2004; (d) Renter et al. 2001; (e) Fischer et al. 2001; (f) Jay -Russell et al. 2010; (g) Kilonzo et al. 2013; (h) Hancock et al. 1998; (i) Jay et al. 2007; (j) LeJeune et al. 2008; (k) Williams et al. 2011; (l) Gaukler et al. 2008; (m) Gaukler et al. 2009; (n) Shere et al. 1998; (o) Pedersen et al. 2006; (p) Milani et al. 2012 . The data presented in this figure were included if the animals were in the United States; the number of animals sampled was at least 25; the samples were taken from the animal itself, not off the ground; the animals did not die of a disease; and the animals were not farm -raised or in a zoo. WFA Handbook 2016 49 Salmonella Pathogens in Mammals and Birds Figure 5 depicts prevalence of Salmonella in native and non-native animals in the United States. Salmonella was detected in white-tailed deer in Texas where they shared rangeland with sheep that had the similar pathogen levels, and in white-tailed deer in Nebraska. Some black -tailed deer and a few tule elk were found with Salmonella in California Coast farmlands and rangeland, as were various wildlife (coyote, skunk, opossum) and various rodents (deer mice, house mice, black rat, and ground squirrels). No Salmonella was detected in rabbits or raccoons in the California study, although raccoons have been found with Salmonella in Pennsylvania. Feral pigs roaming cattle rangeland and occasionally in produce fields of California were detected with a higher prevalence of Salmonella. Salmonella bacteria are found in birds, especially in scavenging or carrion -eating birds such as crows and gulls. Others birds are more susceptible, such as the perching birds that died from Salmonella in very large numbers at bird feeders in Great Britain (not shown). It is suggested that the prevalence is low in healthy perching birds because its presence would otherwise soon mean death. Another study included in Figure 5 found that while a great number of bird species near cattle ranches and produce fields in California tested negative for Salmonella, there were various perching bird species that tested positive. House sparrows and brown-headed cowbirds had low prevalence of Salmonella near California dairies, while the cattle had much higher levels. In an Ohio study, house sparrows and European starlings were found with Salmonella at sites on or near dairy, poultry, or swine farms, or near human populations. European starlings were detected with antibiotic resistant Salmonella in one Kansas feedlots study but not in another. While starlings were found with low prevalence in Texas cattle feedlots, it was thought that the contamination of both the cattle feed and water troughs was significantly related to numbers of starlings present. Rock pigeons near Colorado dairy farms were found with Salmonella more often in the summer and fall than the winter. WFA Handbook 2016 50 Figure 5: Percent of U.S. Native & Non -Native Mammal Colon and Avian Cloacal Swab/Tissue Samples with Salmonella Pathogens From : (a) Branham et al. 2005; (b) Renter et al. 2006; (c) Gordus et al. 2011; (d) Gorski et al. 2011; (e) Kilonzo et al. 2013; (f) Compton et al. 2008; (g) Kirk et al. 2002; (h) Morishita et al. 1999; (i) Gaukler et al. 2008; (j) Gaukler et al. 2009; (k) Carlso n et al. 2011; (l) Pedersen et al. 2006. The data presented in this figure were included if the animals were in the U nited States; the number of animals sampled was at least 25; the samples were taken from the animal itself, not off the ground; the anima ls did not die of a disease; and the animals were not farm -raised or in a zoo. WFA Handbook 2016 51 Salmonella Pathogens in Amphibians and Reptiles The amphibian and reptile research data in Figure 6 is shown separately from the other wildlife research in Figure 5 because it is not known how many of the \"cold-blooded animal\" Salmonella serotypes presented in this data are harmful to humans. All are assumed to be a risk, even though most cases of human illness arise from one \"warm-blooded\" type\u2014Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica. In nature, free-ranging amphibians were found with much more Salmonella in Pennsylvania than in California. Wild turtles in Virginia were absent of Salmonella, whereas those in Illinois and especially in the Southwest had higher prevalences. Various free-ranging reptiles in North Carolina and Virginia were not found with Salmonella, but others in Pennsylvania were. Various reptiles in California were detected with Salmonella. The large range of prevalence may be indicative that the higher occurrences of this pathogen are related to other contamination in the landscape. Reptiles are usually asymptomatic carriers, although once other diseases take hold, Salmonella can be a significant opportunistic pathogen contributing to their demise. Figure 6: Percent of U.S. Native Amphibian and Reptile Cloacal/Skin Swab/Tissue Samples with Salmonella Pathogens That May H ave the Potential to Infect Humans From: (a) Chambers and Hulse 2006; (b) Gorski et al. 2013; (c) Brenner 2002; (d) Readel et al. 2010; (e) Gaetner et al. 2008; (f) Saelinger et al. 2006; (g) Richards et al. 2004. The data presented in this figure were included if the animals were in the United States; the number of animals sampled was at least 25; the samples were taken from the animal itself, not off the ground; the animals did not die of a disease; and the animal s were not farm -raised or in a zoo. WFA Handbook 2016 52 Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium and Listeria Pathogens depicts the prevalence of Campylobacter and Cryptosporidium pathogens in native and non- native animals in the United States. Campylobacter was detected in both the gastrointestinal tract and the oral cavity of feral pigs in produce fields and on rangeland with cattle in California Coastal Counties. In this same area (not shown in the figure), additional feral pigs and some native wild animal s (birds, raccoons, coyotes), cattle, and goats were reported with Campylobacter, but not other wildlife (deer, skunks, squirrels, and deer mice). Migratory waterfowl was found with Campylobacter in Colorado, and Canada geese were detected with antibiotic resistant Campylobacter in North Carolina. It is worth mentioning that deer, raccoons, elk, skunks, squirrels, and California gulls have been found with Campylobacter, although they were not shown in Figure 7 because of unacceptable data collection parameters. Most of Campylobacter serotypes found in the gulls in the last study were not closely related to species commonly associated with human illness. A direct relationship between ill persons who consumed peas in Alaska and Campylobacter pathogens found in sandhill crane feces was established with DNA fingerprinting techniques (not shown; see Table 3 Recorded Outbreaks Associated with Wildlife). Campylobacter was detected in flies, slugs, and ruminant feces that were collected from a single farm in Scotland over a 19-week period (not shown). Feral pigs tested positive for Cryptosporidium in the California Coastal Counties, as did deer mice i n two other studies (Figure 7). A thorough analysis was conducted in the deer mice study by calculating the environmental loading rate of the animals using the number of positive animals, daily fecal shedding rate, and the estimated population. This type of analysis can be most helpful with determining risk. As previously mentioned, most studies are only determining the prevalence in the animals. In the California 'various rodents' study (Figure 7), it was suggested that control efforts that potentially reduce biodiversity, such as non-crop vegetation clearing and indiscriminate poison baiting, might also decrease the diversity of rodent species. When diversity decreases, interaction between individuals of the remaining species increases, which may cause an increase in pathogen prevalence in those individuals. Not shown in Figure 7 were incidences of Listeria detected in Roosevelt elk in California, fox in Illinois, raccoon in Connecticut, skunk in North Dakota, and a preliminary report of wildlife with Listeria in New York. Deer, moose, voles, mice, muskrats, shrews, otters, raccoons, and geese and other wild birds have been found with Listeria in Canada. Rooks were detected with Listeria in Sweden, Finland, and Germany, and crows in Japan. A study conducted in California suggests that a reduction in rodent species diversity may cause increased pathogen prevalence i n the individuals that remain. D.

WFA Handbook 2016 54 A.II. 2 Prevalence of Pathogens in Livestock Food-borne pathogens can be present in livestock, often at higher rates than in wildlife. While the research regarding food-borne pathogens in livestock is extensive, Tables 14, 15 and 16 present snapshots of prevalence. These examples include E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in dairy and beef cattle, swine, and chicken layers and broilers. Some of the data looks at prevalence between livestock operations, and other data reports prevalence in the animals themselves.

WFA Handbook 2016 56 Major environmental f actors and conservation practices that influence the f ate and transport of pathogens in agricultural landscapes are listed in Tables 17 and 18 for water, Tables 19 and 20 for soil, and Tables 21 and 22 for air resources. Table 17: Environmental Factors that Influence Pathogen Reduction in Water Resource Concern: Pathogens in Surface Water Factors Fate and Transport of Pathogens in Surface Water Exposure of water to UV radiation damages pathogens and typically leads to quick reduction. High intensity sunlight radiation decreased levels of cultivable fecal indicator bacteria in water. (Schultz -Fademrecht et al. 2008) A study conducted in an outdoor laboratory setting found that inactivation rates of pathogens in water were higher in sunlight than in the dark. Pathogen inactivation was directly related to the amount of in solution (i.e., dose of sunlight). (Sinton et al. 2007) In a simulated environment laboratory study, E. coli exhibited a strong sensitivity to sunlight. (Fujioka & Yoneyama 2002) When subjected to strong natural sunlight, the exposure time required for the complete inactivation of pathogens suspended in water and stored in plastic bottles was 20 minutes for Campylobacter jejuni , 45 minutes for Staphylococcus epider mis, 90 minutes for enteropathogenic E. coli , and 150 minutes for Yersinia enterocolitica . (Boyle et al. 2008) In surface waters, sunlight is the most important inactivating factor in determining the survival of E. coli , Salmonella typhimurium, and other bacteria. (Pachepsky et al. 2011) Turbid water may be associated with increased levels of pathogens, as compared to non -turbid water. In coastal creeks, turbidity was positively correlated with the abundance of enteric bacteria. (Mallin et al. 2000) During times of higher water turbidity, there was a general tendency toward higher densities of pathogens. (Wilkes et al. 2011) Sunlight/UV Exposure Shady conditions created by wetland vegetation may protect pathogens from UV effects. Due to the shade created by emergent wetland plants, it is likely that sunlight plays a less important role in pathogen inactivation in wetlands than in animal waste lagoons. (Hill 2003) Predation / Competition Predation and competition by native microbial communities in water may increase pathogen reduction rates. Predation was thought the likely mechanism for the high removal of C. parvum in canal water. (Diallo et al. 2009) Plankton may predate upon C. jejuni in aquatic environments. (McElhany & Pillai 2011) Predation and/ or competition for nutrients may affect the survival of C. jejuni and E. coli in aquatic environments. (Korhonen & Martlkalnen 1991) Harborage Some protozoa and algae may host pathogens. Campylobacter spp. typically survived longer when co -cultured with golden algae D. cartularies , as well as three amoebas from the genus Acanthamoeba. (Axelsson -Olsson polyphaga , C. jejuni cells tolerated pHs far below their normal range. (Axelsson -Olsson et al. 2010b) The water underlying mats of Cladophora (a green algae) had a significantly greater concentration of E. coli than the surrounding lake water. (Heuvel et al. 2010) While it is documented that aquatic organisms a can aid in pathogen survival, the relative importance of their role in serving as a reservoir for pathogens is not currently known. (Pachepsky et al. 2011) Appendix III: Factors that Influence Pathogen Reduction in Water, Soil and Air WFA Handbook 2016 57 Table 17 (continued) Harborage Some biofilms may harbor pathogens. A laboratory experiment found that natural microbial assemblages [biofilms] occurring in a Pennsylvania stream showed seasonal differences in the retention of Cryptosporidium oocysts. (Wolyniak et al. 2010) While river biofilms displayed indicator bacteria at two orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding water, the indicator bacteria made up only a minor fraction of the whole biofilm community. (Balzer et al. 2010) Nutrient availability is a factor in determining bacteria survival in water. E. coli could grow in autoclaved water taken from below a sewage outfall, but not in the water taken from above the outfall. Differences in nutrient content were considered the reason for the difference. (Pache psky et al. 2011) Nutrients Nutrients may influence competition with and predation of pathogenic bacteria. Nutrients can cause an increase in competition and predation of pathogenic bacteria in water. (Pachepsky et al. 2011) Temperature Lower temperatures tend to extend pathogen survival. Warmer temperatures, conversely, tend to decrease pathogen survival. Pathogen survival in water was enhanced by cooler temperatures. (Berry & Wells 2010) While higher temperatures can prolong bacteria survival, these temper atures also favor the growth of organisms that predate upon bacteria. (Vymazal 2005) Re- suspension Re-suspended sediments in irrigation water can be a source of pathogens. Activities that re -suspend sediments into the water, such as irrigation water in take from ponds, can elevate the concentrations of E. coli in water. (Pachepsky et al. 2011) Livestock feces deposited on land may increase pathogens in surface water runoff. Higher concentrations of E. coli were found in irrigation tailwater when cattle were present in the pasture during irrigation than when cattle were not present. (Knox et al. 2008) Water running off open livestock systems can contain contaminants including E. coli . (Koelsch et al. 2006) Samples taken from lakes, streams, rivers, and ponds on California's Central Coast showed that areas of higher elevation where cattle were frequently observed grazing near the watershed were \"h ot-spots\" for pathogen prevalence. (Cooley et al. 2014) Wildlife may degrade the water quality of irrigation water storage ponds. Inputs by birds or other wildlife can degrade the quality of water in storage ponds. (Pachepsky, 2011) Biological Movement Human activity may degrade water quality, as runoff from urban areas a can be contaminated with pathogens. A study looking at pathogens in runoff water found that urban runoff had the greatest percentage of total potential pathogens, when compared to agricultural and n atural -area runoff. (Ibekwe et al. 2013) WFA Handbook 2016 58 Table 18: Conservation Practices That Influence Pathogen Reduction in Water Resource Concern: Pathogens in Surface Water Factors Fate and Transport of Waterborne Pathogens in Water Constructed (656), Created (658), Enhanced (659), and Restored (657) Wetlands Plant Emissions/ Exudates Wetland vegetation may create undesirable conditions for pathogens by increasing oxygen levels and secreting root exudates. Aquatic plants and algae may increase oxygen levels in the water, making undesirable conditions for pathogens. (Vymazal 2005) Root exudates from aquatic plants may be toxic to some pathogens. (Vymazal 2005) Wetlands greatly reduce the movement of bacteria in surface water, though some bacteria may still be present in wetland outflow. A two -year study showed that constructed wetlands were effective at removing various microbial populations from wastewater. The presence of vegetation slightly enhan ced (approximately 0.5 log) the removal efficiency for most microbial groups. (Hench et al. 2003) A small wetland used to treat runoff from a large agricultural area was able to retain 70% of indicator bacteria with a hydraulic loading time of less than a day. (Diaz et al. 2010) Looking at E. coli concentrations in irrigation tailwater above and below a wetland, it was found that the wetland decreased E. coli concentrations by approximately 40%. (Knox et al. 2007) Water Movement/ Interception Long residence time and low loading rates may improve wetland function, which may result in increased pathogen reduction rates. Conversely, short residence time and high loading rates decrease wetland function, which results in decreased pathogen reduction rates. Hydraulic residence time ( HRT) appeared to have the greatest effect on the removal efficiency of indicator bacteria. Longer HRTs tended to be more efficient in removing indicator bacteria than shorter HRTs. (Diaz et al. 2010) A review of literature on constructed wetlands with em ergent vegetation found that hydraulic loading rate (HLR), resultant hydraulic residence time (HRT), and the presence of vegetation are the primary factors that influence the efficiency of enteric microbe removal in constructed wetlands. (Vymazal 2005) Natural wetlands often have channelized flow paths. When compared to a non -degraded reference wetland, a channelized wetland had shorter residence times and lower E. coli retention efficiency. (Knox et al. 2008) Wildlife Consider - ations Wildlife may inc rease the concentration of pathogens in a wetland. Resident and visiting wildlife may play an important role in elevating levels of pathogens in wetland effluents. (Graczyk et al. 2009) Field Border (386), Filter strip (393), Conservation Cover (327), Riparian Forest Buffer (391) Water Movement/ Interception Pathogens moving as free cells or attached to manure, soil, or other debris in concentrated and sheet flow can be greatly reduced by vegetative treatment systems such as field borders, filter strips, conservation cover, and riparian forest buffers when conditions are right. The likelihood of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes isolation in fields was significantly decreased if growers reported presence of a vegetative buffer zone, defined as a zone of at least 5 m separating the edge of produce fields from potential environmental pathogen reservoirs (e.g., forests, roads, water ways, livestock operations). (Strawn et al. 2013) A review of vegetative treatment systems (VTS) used for managing runoff from open lot livestock systems determined that pollutant reduction is based upon two primary mechanisms: a) sedimentation, typicall y occurring within the first few meters of a VTS, and b) infiltration of runoff into the soil profile. Critical design factors include pre -treatment, sheet flow, discharge control, siting, and sizing. (Koelsch et al. 2006) Grass filter strips measuring 9 meters in width trapped most of the fecal bacteria in surface runoff but did not reduce pathogen load enough to meet existing water quality standards. (Coyne et al. 1998) Grass vegetated buffer strips reduced the total number of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts discharged in overland and subsurface flow. An increase in rainfall application rate reduced the effectiveness of the buffers. (Tate et al. 2004) WFA Handbook 2016 59 Table 18 (continued) Water Movement/ Interception Each additional meter of vegetative buffer reduced E. coli discharge by 0.3 to 3.1 log (10). (Tate et al. 2006) Reduction in the concentration of fecal coliforms, E. coli , and fecal streptococci in runoff were positively correlated to vegetative filter strip: drainage area ratio and negatively correlated to the depth of the rainfall event. (Mankin et al. 2006) Vegetated filter strips reduced the amount of water running off test plots. The reduced runoff in turn reduced the surface transport of fecal c oliform bacteria, while increasing the vertical transport of bacteria into the soil. (Roodsari et al. 2005) Modeled scenario analysis suggests potential reduction (3 -82%; median 35%) of E. coli concentrations in stream waters with riparian buffer strips by eliminating livestock defecation in and near streams, and by trapping of bacteria in the riparian vegetation. (Collins & Rutherford 2004) Riparian buffer strips function similarly to vegetative treatment areas, but are more critical because they are t he last control point before the pathogens enter streams. (Oliver et al. 2007) A 24% reduction in fecal coliforms was documented for every ten meters of buffer length. (Lewis et al. 2010) Vegetated buffers, ranging in width from 1 to 25 meters, general ly reduced the median fecal coliform concentration in runoff water by more than 99%. (Sullivan et al. 2007) Grassland buffers of 1.1 to 2.1 m width, with residual dry vegetation matter between 225 an d 4,500 kg/ha, and land slopes of 5 to 35%, generated b etween 3.2 and 8.8 log retention of Cryptosporidium parvum. (Atwill et al. 2006) One positive E. coli 0157:H7 result was found out of 60 freshly -cut hay samples from a 4.5 ha vegetative treatment system that received pond storage water from a cattle feed lot. Neither E. coli 0157:H7 nor Campylobacter spp. were recovered from hay following baling and storage. (Berry et al. 2007) Size of Runoff Event Large runoff events can reduce the efficacy of vegetative buffer strips. To reduce the delivery of fecal microbes to waterways during large runoff events, grass buffer strips need to exceed 5 meters in length. It was also found that some of the microbes previously trapped by grass strips were remobilized and washed out during a later runoff event. (Collins et al. 2004) Large storm events can flush E. coli from the soil. (Fenlon et al. 2000) Excessive hydraulic loading rates and inadequate retention times may lead to poor filter strip performance. (Schellinger & Clausen 1992) Manure slurry containing col iforms was applied to a 6 -m vegetated filter strip (VFS) and bare ground plots. The VFS efficiency was found to be <95% in 25%, < 75% in 23%, and <25% in 20% of cases. The partial failure of VFS to retain coliforms was due to relatively long high -intensity rainfalls and low hydraulic conductivities. (Guber et al. 2009) Temperature / Moisture The cool, moist, nutrient rich conditions of accumulated vegetation and litter in filter strips may increase pathogen survival. High levels of residual dry matter (45 00 kg/h) in filter strips may provide a moist, cool, nutrient rich environment preferable for E. coli survival and multiplication. These conditions may have been the cause of increased discharges of E. coli in runoff water from filter strips with high leve ls of residual dry matter, compared to filter strips with lower levels of residual dry matter (225 -900 kg/h). (Tate et al. 2006) Maintenance Proper maintenance may be required to maintain vegetative buffer efficacy. Several maintenance issues are critical in VTA [Vegetative Treatment System] function: 1) a good stand of dense vegetation, 2) management practices that contribute to strong fall growth and well -established winter vegetative cover, 3) regular harvesting and removal (animal grazing does not represent an acceptable harvesting option), 4) prevention of channel flow, 5) minimizing solids accumulation, 6) uniform flow conditions, and 7) minimal animal traffic and limiting of vehicle traffic to dry conditions are critical. (Koelsch et al. 2006 ) WFA Handbook 2016 60 Table 19: Environmental Factors that Influence Pathogen Reduction in Soil Resource Concern: Soil Contamination, Pathogens Factors Fate and Transport of Pathogens in Soil Sunlight/UV Exposure Higher intensity UV radiation reduces survival of pathogens in soil. Pathogens near the soil surface died off quicker than what was reported in other studies that examined survival deeper in the soil, presumably because of solar radiation. (Gessel et al . 2004) After dairy manure was amended to the soil, fecal bacteria numbers usually declined to pre -application levels in 2 to 3 months depending on soil temperature and potential exposure to desiccation and ultra violet light. (Stoddard et al. 1998) Survival of Escherichia coli and a fecal streptococcus was studied in shaded and exposed outdoor soil plots. During summer and fall, the organisms survived twice as long in the shaded area. During winter and spring, survival in shade and exposed areas were very similar, which may be a reflection of the cool, wet weather, but it may also be partially explained by the reduced solar radiation from heavy cloud cover, shortened days, and low solar angle. (Van Donsel et al. 1967) Competition and antagonistic interactions decrease pathogens in soil. Death to E. coli occurs in soil by competition. (Bogosian et al. 1996) Pathogen populations decline more rapidly in manure -amended un -autoclaved soil than in autoclaved soil likely due to antagonistic interactions with indigenous soil microorganisms. (Jiang et al. 2002) Indigenous Pseudomonads flourescens (found in decaying organic matter) isolated in soil was very effective at inhibiting growth of E. coli O157:H7 at 25 degrees Cel cius and was somewhat effective at su ppressing it at 10 and 15 degrees Celcius. (Johannessen et al. 2005) Survival of E. coil in soil was significantly influenced by the complexity of the microbial community. Survival of E. coli progressively increased w ith the reduction of microbial community diversity. ( Liang et al. 2011) Microbial community diversity affects survival of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wheat rhizosphere. (Matos et al. 2005) Coliform populations often decreased fast er when E. coli O157:H7 was added indicating possible competition between microflora. (Gagliardi and Karns 2002) Reduced competition in soil by fumigation increases long -term pathogen survival. If soil is contaminated by E. coli pathogens, fumigation alone may not eliminate the pathogen, but it may cause a decrease in microbial diversity, which may enhance the survival of the pathogen. (Ibekwe et al. 2011 and Ibekwe and Ma 2011) Fumigated soils foster E. coli O157:H7 growth. So il systems with reduced biological complexity offer enhanced opportunities for invading microbial species to establish and persist. (van Elsas et al. 2007) Predation/ Competition Protozoa predation reduces pathogen survival in soil. Decrease of Salmonella was related to growth of protozoa in the soil. (Garcia et al. 2010) The survival of Salmonella has been shown to be influenced by predation by soil protozoa ns amongst others. (Jacobsen and Bech 2012) The role of protozoan predation in E. coli population decline was demonstrated by the simultaneous increase of the indigenous amoeba counts and the decline of E. coli cell number. (Recorbet et al. 1992) When the soil was inoculated with E. coli K12 strain, there was an increase of the protozoan numbers, and when the soil was amended with a eukaryotic inhibitor (which kills protozoa), the period of E. coli K12 survival was increased. (Sorensen et al. 1999) Protozoans can decrease the number of pathogens present in soil. (Tate 1978) Temperature/ Moisture High temperature and low moisture reduce pathogen survival in soil. Elevated temperatures, especially combined with drying conditions, will effectively increase die -off rates of enteric (human) bacteria. Lower temperatures appear to increase su rvival time. (Crane and Moore 1985) Mortality of fecal coliform bacteria at the 0 to 5, 5 to 15, and 15 to 30 cm soil depths also correlated with decreasing moisture and increasing temperature in a curvilinear relationship. (Entry et al. 2000) The rate s of E. coli O157 decline in the susceptible sub -population were more rapid under higher temperature and low moisture conditions. The rates of decline in the resistant population were not significantly different across the range of temperature and moisture contents applied to soil cores during the study. (Ogden et al. 2001) After the sunlight reduced the numbers of non -fecal coliforms in the soil, there was growth in numbers as a result of temperature and rainfall variations. (Van Donsel et al. 1967) WFA Handbook 2016 61 Table 19 (continued) Temperature/ Moisture Freeze -thaw cycles reduce pathogen survival in soil. Freeze -thaw cycles reduce bacterial populations. (Crane and Moore 1985) Freezing and thawing of soil decreases survival of Salmonella. A late fall manure application will not increase the risk of contaminating vegetables planted the next spring, since further experiments showed that repeated freeze -thaw cycles were detrimental to the survival of Salmonella and E. coli in manure -fertilize d soil. (Natvig et al. 2002) pH Higher and lower pH reduce s pathogen survival in soil. E. coli and Salmonella die-off increased with decrease in soil moisture and was minimum in a pH range of 6 -7. Survival was adversely affected outside the pH range of 5.8 -8.4. (Reddy et al. 1981) Survival of E. coil appears to be better in more neutral to alkaline soil than in more acidic soil. (Sjogren 1994) Soil Texture Heavy soil texture increases pathogen survival in soil. Survival of Salmonella and E. coli in farm fields depends on the soil, including the clay content (more clay, longer survival vs. more sand, shorter survival). (Barak and Schroeder 2012) Presence of higher amount of clay in a clay loam, versus loam soils, may favor the survival of STEC ( E. coli ) O26. (Fremaux et al. 2008) Data suggests that clay increases persistence and activity of E. coli O157:H7 and other coliforms. (Gagliardi 2002) The time needed to reach the detection limit for E. coli O157:H7 for loamy sand, sandy loam, and sil ty clay was 32, 80, and 110 days, respectively. (Ma et al. 2011) E. coli O157:H7 tainted irrigation water applied to various soil textures persisted longest in clay soils. (Ibekwe et al. 2004) Compared with sandy soil, clay soil is of a finer texture and thus has smaller pore spaces that may protect adhered cells against predation or niche competition. (Barak and Schroeder 2012) Nutrients Nutrient -rich environment increases pathogen survival. Excess nutrients foster E. coli growth in soil. (Byappanahalli and Ishii 2011) High assimilable organic carbon and total nitrogen correlate with high survival of E. coli O157:H7 in soil. (Ma et al. 2012) Survival of E. coli O157 was found to be greatest in soil cores containing root ed grass compared to just manure or slurry. (Maule 2000) Salmonella can swarm around active root zone areas where there is a nutrient -rich environment from the root's exudates. These areas are also colonized by diverse bacterial communities. To survive, Salmonella may need to avoid defensive antimicrobials produced by the plant and compete with rival microbes for nutrients. (Barak and Schroeder 2012) Diseased plant tissue may provide a nutrient rich and protected ecological niche for enteric (human) pat hogens. However, this opportunity for growth is dictated by the nature of the pathogen's interactions with the resident plant microflora. (Brandl 2006) Members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella and E. coli, are facultative anaerobes, fermen ting sugars to produce lactic acid and various other end products. Most also are able to use nitrate as an alternate respiratory chain acceptor under anaerobic conditions. (Brenner 1984) Salt High salt levels reduce pathogen survival in soil. Higher electrical conductivity levels may produce shorter survival time of E. coli O157:H7 in soil. (Ma et. al 2012) Harborage Some types of pathogens may be harbored by protozoa in soil. Ingestion of Salmonella by soilborne prot ozoa resulted in a large number of vesicles being released containing viable Salmonella, while ingestion by Listeria resulted mostly in death, with only infrequent Listeria being released. (Brandl et al. 2005) Harborage Pathogens may be harbored by biofilms in soil. Biofilms enhance survival of E. coli in soil. (Abu -Lail and Camesano 2003) Biofilm formation is one multi -cellular, aggregative behavior used by bacteria to successfully colonize plants. Salmonella strains with stronger biofilm -formin g ability in vitro, have stronger adhesion and persistence on lettuce leaves. Biofilm formation is equally important for root colonization. (Barak and Schroeder 2012) E. coli strains can create biofilms on soil that help restrict them from being transpor ted in water. (Salvucci et al. 2009) Bacteria frequently live in biofilms, which are surface -associated communities encased in a hydrated extracellular polymeric substance matrix that is composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. B acteriophages have been used for controlling biofilms on stainless steel. (Viazis and Diez -Gonzalez 2011) WFA Handbook 2016 62 Table 19 (continued) Antibiotic Resistance Antibiotic resistance can be transferred from manure to soil microbes. The environmental spread of antibiotic resistance can occur in soil bacterial populations. (Jechalke et al. 2013) Evidence of increasing resistance to antibiotics in soil and other natural isolates highlights the importance of horizontal transfer of resistance genes in bacteria. Th e selective pressure for the spread of resistance genes correlates strongly with the clinical and agricultural overuse of antibiotics. (Nwosu 2001) WFA Handbook 2016 63 Table 20: Conservation Practices That Influence Pathogen Reduction in Soil Resource Concern: Soil Contamination Factors Fate and Transport of Pathogens in Soil Cover Crop (340) Species The relative length of pathogen survival in relation to cover crops. E. coli O157:H7 persisted a short time (up to 40 days) in soil with hairy vetch or with clover, and in soil with no plants; whereas it persisted more than twice as long (3 months) on alfalfa roots and on rye roots. (Gagliardi and Karns 2002) Rye cover crops are usually grown in the winter for more than 3 months (Smith 2013) and alfalfa for a couple of years. Anti - microbial Effects Compounds in some cover crops are harmful to pathogens. Glucosinolate compounds derived from cover crops in the Brassica family ha ve an antimicrobial affect on Salmonella and to a somewhat lesser degree to E. coli O157:H7. (Patel 2013) Microbial Diversity Soil Microbial Communities Cover crops can have a large impact on the size and activity of soil microbial communities. (Bolton et al. 1985; Fraser et al. 1988; Kirchner et al. 1993; and Powlson et al. 1987) Compost Facility (317)* Sunlight/ UV Exposure Higher intensity UV radiation reduces survival of pathogens in compost. Higher light intensity in the summer was a contributing factor on the decreased survival of pathogens in compost versus lower light intensity in the winter, which increased survival. (Kim and Jiang 2010) Competition decreases pathogens in compost. Bacteriophages (a type of virus) added to un -autoclaved dairy manure compost inoculated with Salmonella resulted in a greater reduction of the pathogen as compared to autoclaved compost due to competition. (Heringa et al. 2010) Competition in non -autoclaved compost did not allow pathogens to grow, whereas autoclaved compost did. (Kim and Jiang 2010) Indigenous microorganisms are critical for suppressing E. coli O157:H7 growth in compost. (Kim et al. 2011) Pathogens did not survive when inoculated into stabilized compost but showed minimal die -off in compost. (Paniel al. (protozoa and algae), not fungal populations, have the most dramatic effect on E. coli O157:H7 reduction. E. coli O157:H7 declined faster in untreated compost than in compost treated with cycloheximide. The chemical treatment was thought to kill the protists while leaving the fungal community unharmed. (Puri and Dudley 2010) Microbial Diversity Soil Microbial Communities The use of compost has a long -term effect on soil microbial activity. (Ros et al 2006) Moistu re With enough moisture, unfinished compost can increase pathogens. If there is a small number of E. coli O157 cells present and enough moisture, the pathogen can re -grow in the compost. (Kim et al. 2009) WFA Handbook 2016 64 Table 20 (continued) Temperature While high temperature reduces pathogen survival in compost, it doesn't necessarily destroy all. Elevated temperatures may not be lethal for all microorganisms, but may affect their efficiency and further contribute to the decrease in microbial activity. Some microorganisms form spores in response to excessive heating, and when more favorable conditions exist those spores can germinate. (USDA Part 637) Nutrients A low carbon: nitrogen ratio in compost resulted in quicker reduction of pathogens. Compost preparations with an initial C:N ratio of 20:1 required a maximum of 4 days of storage before Salmonella was inactivated, whereas preparations with C:N ratios of 30:1 and 40:1 required more than 5 and 7 days of storage, respectively. (Erickson et al. 2009) Maturity Making quality compost is dependent on whether it has matured enough to kill human pathogens but not excessively so that antagonistic microorganisms are not able to re -colonize. Immature compost serves as food for pathogens and increases disease even when biocontrol agents are present. On the other hand, excessively stabilized organic matter do es not support the activity of biocontrol agents. (Hoitink and Grebus 1994) Plant disease suppression is the direct result of the activity of consortia of antagonistic microorganisms that naturally re - colonize the compost during the cooling phase of the process. (Hadar and Papadopoulou 2012) Technique The windrow method of compost making consistently reduces pathogen survival. Composts produced with windrow methods were of higher microbiological quality than were those produced with static pile methods, and point -of-sale bagged composts scored very high. More effort is required to improve hygiene consistency in relation to management practices. (Brinton et al. 2009) * The assumption has been made that the compost from the compost facility will be used in accordance with the Nutrient Management (590) practice standard. WFA Handbook 2016 65 Table 21: Environmental Factors that Influence Pathogen Reduction in Air Resource Concern: Air Quality - Particulate Matter with Pathogens Factors Fate and Transport of Pathogens in Air Exposure to UV radiation both damages and dries pathogens and typically leads to quick reduction on leaf surfaces . UV radiation limits microbes in the phyllo sphere . (Beattie and Lindow 1995) UV radiation influences populations on leaf surfaces. (Newsham et al. 1997) Higher numbers of bacteria have been found on lower surfaces suggesting avoidance strategies necessary for surviving UV radiation. (Sundin 1999) Biological control agents, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, Beauveria bassiana, and nematodes on leaves have also been found to be affected by UV radiation. (Ignoffo 1978) Sunlight/UV Exposure Pathogen reduction from UV exposure in the shady areas of the permanent vegetation is related to dosage. Canopy structure, leaf area, and, to a lesser degree, the brightness of the sunlight were found to influence UV penetration into vegetation more than the sun's angle. (Shulski 2004) A biological dosimeter system using attenuated E. coli was created to measure microorganism activity in the canopy of grass. The E. coli was placed in cell suspensions within small plastic packets at different locations in turf grass, along with a miniature UV -B radiometer. Die -off was linearly related to UV -B dosage. (Yuen 2002) Predation/ Competition Some native microbial communities on leaf surfaces increase pathogen reduction rates through competition, predation, and antagonism. Enterobacter asburiae repressed the growth of the E. coli O157:H7 when sprayed on leaf lettuce. (Moyne et al. 2011) The reduction of E. coli O157:H7 numbers on spinach leaves by natural epiphytic bacteria show that native plant microbiota can be used for bio -control of food -borne pathogens. Fifteen different g enera, the majority belonging to Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae, reduced growth rates of E. coil O157:H7 in vitro by either nutrient competition or acid production. However, other epiphytes \u2014phylloepiphytic bacteria belonging to eight different genera \u2014increased numbers of E. coil O157: H7 and may promote the persistence of enteric pathogens on the phyllosphere. (Lopez -Velasco 2012) Symbiosis Other native microbial communities on leaf surfaces may facilitate the growth of pathogen populations. Wausteria paucula promoted E. coli O157:H7 survival on leaf lettuce. (Moyne et al. 2011) WFA Handbook 2016 66 Table 22: Conservation Practices That Influence Pathogen Reduction in Air Resource Concern: Air Quality - Particulate Matter with Pathogens Factors Fate and Transport of Pathogens in Air Windbreak (38 0) Interception of Pathogens Preliminary indication shows that vegetative buffers may intercept pathogens . Vegetative buffers (that function like windbreaks) were placed between poultry houses sprayed with two attenuated live vaccine strains and coops with pathogen -free chickens. The proportion of virus -positive serum samples was significantly greater from birds in the control (without the veg. buffer) than with the vegetative buffer in t he last of three trials. It was thought that once the buffers had grown to a fuller and greater height, they would have functioned better to reduce the spread of pathogens (Burley 2011). Aerodynamics of Dust Near Windbreaks How Windbreaks Reduce Dust Downwind Windbreaks reduce dust downwind by both dropping particulates and lifting emissions into the upper air stream for greater dispersion and dilution (Malone 2004). Intercepti on of Dust by Buffers Vegetative buffers can be effective at reducing dust. Vegetative buffers can remove between 35% -55% of dust in the air (Luety 2004; Hernandez 2012; Malone 2004). Plants Good at Interception Conifers are very good at interception. Conifers are better than deciduous trees for dense foliage (Straight 2007 ; Adrizal 2008) and interception. The needle -like foliage of conifers captures two to four times more pesticide spray than broad -leaves because they don't alter their leaf alignment in high winds (Ucar 2003).
