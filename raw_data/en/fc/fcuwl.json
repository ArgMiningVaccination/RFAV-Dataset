What's more, tests indicated that David had an aggressive form of the disease. That was in 2016. Today, tests detect no sign of cancer in David, 65, of Bound Brook, thanks to specialists at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset's Steeplechase Cancer Center. A FASTMO\u00c1ING DISEASE David's primary care physician irst became concerned when she noticed that his prostate\u2014a walnut-sized gland that produces luid that carries sperm\u2014was enlarged and irm. Then a blood test showed that his level of PSA, or prostate speciic antigen\u2014a marker of prostate cancer\u2014was 103 ng/dL. A normal level for a man his age is less than 4 ng/dL. A biopsy, in which tissue samples are extracted from the prostate and tested in a lab, found cancerous cells. Taken together, these signs indicated that David had a fast-moving disease that may have already begun to spread outside the prostate gland, says Dhiren Dave, MD, a urologist at RWJPE Somerset Urological Associates in Somerville. David, who has his own home-repair business, was stoic in the face of worrisome news. \"It is what it is,\" he recalls thinking. His family wasn't so sanguine. \"It was scary,\" says his oldest daughter, Ashley Salmon, 2, o Wall Township, who accompanied David to his appointments along with her sister, Lexie, 30. \"But Dr. Dave was great. He was optimistic but realistic. We felt like we were in really good hands.\" M\u00a9LTIDISCI\u008eLINARY CARE Dr. Dave knew that treating David would be complex. \"When someone has what we call high-risk prostate cancer, he requires multiple modes of treatment,\" says Dr. Dave. \"David needed care from a multidisciplinary team.\" His team included Jonathan Rosenbluth, MD, a medical oncologist, and Joel Braver, MD, a radiation oncologist. Prior to David's treatment, his case was reviewed at the team's monthly Urologic Oncology Multidisciplinary Conference, during which various specialists meet to create a personalized care plan. The primary goal was to remove David's prostate, but irst he started receiving hormone therapy to reduce his natural levels of testosterone. \"That takes the fuel away from the cancer,\" says Dr. Dave. In addition, he was given a chemotherapy drug, which is normally administered after a man's prostate has been removed. This experimental use of the drug was possible because Dr. Dave and his colleagues at the Steeplechase Cancer Center are co-investigators, in partnership with Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, in a larger clinical trial designed to determine if combining hormone therapy with the chemotherapy drug improves the results of surgery. While David was not included in the trial, he was eligible to receive the experimental drug combination. After completing the chemo regimen (and continuing on hormone therapy), David underwent surgery to remove the prostate. The procedure, known as radical prostatectomy, is traditionally performed in an \"open\" manner, meaning it requires an incision above the navel that can be up to four inches long. However, some surgeons perform radical prostatectomies using small laparoscopic tools, which require only a few tiny incisions, most a half-inch or smaller. Smaller incisions mean less post-op pain and a shorter recovery period. To remove David's diseased tissue, Dr. Dave performed a robotic prostatectomy, which takes the laparoscopic approach a leap forward. During this procedure\u2014which Dr. Dave has performed more than 500 times\u2014he sits at a console and views the patient's internal tissues on a monitor. This highly magniied, three-dimensional view allows for precise dissection of tissue, which dramatically reduces bleeding during surgery. Using controls, Dr. Dave manipulates the camera and other delicate robotic instruments. Unlike the rigid instruments used in laparoscopy, robotic tools have \"wrists,\" allowing them to bend in different directions. But unlike human hands, \"robotic instruments don't shake\u2014they're steady,\" says Dr. Dave. After the surgery, David spent one night in the hospital (open procedures require two or three nights) before going home. \"I didn't feel much pain at all,\" he recalls. S\u00a9CCESSF\u00a9L TREATMENT Tests indicated that David's pelvic lymph nodes contained prostate cancer cells. To eliminate them, David underwent a course of radiation treatments. Today, two-and-a half years after his diagnosis, David's treatments are complete and his PSA has dropped to 0 ng/dL. \"It's been a long journey, but right now, David shows no evidence of disease,\" says Dr. Dave. David, who is regaining strength and some of the weight he lost, says, \"The medical team did a great job.\" His family agrees. \"We're thrilled,\" says Ashley. \"I'm grateful my father was treated at a hospital that offers the most progressive treatment possible.\" DHIREN DAVE, MD KNOW YOUR NUMBER 30% Studies indicate that early detection of prostate cancer with the PSA test saves lives. A 2017 analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that men who undergo PSA screening reduce their risk of dying from prostate cancer by about 30 percent. The PSA test can spot prostate cancer at an early stage, says Dhiren Dave, MD, a urologist at RWJPE Somerset Urological Associates in Somerville. \"The earlier we pick it up, the better the patient's prognosis,\" he says. The American Urological Association (AUA) recommends that men at average risk begin screening at age 55 after a discussion with their physician. For those who are at high risk, the AUA recommends screening starting at age 40. 55 Healthy Together | 4 | Winter 2020 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET | 5 Somerset_ProstateCa_Winter20_final.indd 5 12/12/19 3:41 PMJUST ONE YEAR AFTER SUFFERING A NEAR- FATAL CARDIAC ARREST, A PATIENT CYCLED 75 MILES FOR A FUNDRAISING EVENT. seen by his primary care physician on September 24. Then, shortly before midnight the same day, Michael's wife, Stefanie, was reading in bed next to her sleeping husband when his right arm suddenly jerked upward and he convulsed. She saw that Michael was blue in the face and foaming at the mouth. Stefanie and the couple's 20-year-old son, Nathan, took turns giving Michael CPR while their 2-year-old daughter, Jennie, called 11. He was brought to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset, where physicians determined that Michael had experienced a cardiac arrest. He underwent cardiac catheterization and an emergency angioplasty, during which three stents were placed in a blocked artery to restore blood ow. Then he was transferred to the Critical Care Unit.FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE The attending cardiologist explained the team's game plan: Michael would be treated using therapeutic hypothermia, in which his body temperature would be lowered to around degrees Fahrenheit for 2 hours. \"This procedure seems to reduce brain damage, possibly because it lessens inammation in the brain,\" says Joe \u0002hn, MD, Director of Echocardiography. It's particularly useful for cardiac patients who don't regain consciousness. \"^owering body temperature increases the chances that a person will recover from a cardiac arrest,\" he says. On Michael's eighth night in the unit, he went into cardiac arrest again, requiring CPR and defibrillation. It happened two more times that evening. \"I was in awe watching the staff hear the words Code It was six days before the ike MS: City to Shore Ride\u2014a fundraising event that beneits the National Multiple Sclerosis Society\u2014in September 201 ,and Michael Chenkin was training. \u0002t the start of his third consecutive day of training rides, he felt tired and not as strong. \"I'd had to stop a few times and take some puffs from my inhaler, but I assumed my exercise-induced asthma was acting up,\" recalls the 5-year-old social worker from ridgewater.

She refused to leave Michael's side, arriving early and staying late or overnight to actively participate in his care. The nurses brought her pizza and, when she fell asleep with her head resting on Michael's bed rail, the respiratory therapist propped her head up with a pillow and put a blanket over her shoulders. Two days later, Michael began to show signs of consciousness. \"Within minutes of my telling the staff, his entire medical team was in Michael's room to see for themselves,\" says Stefanie. \u0002s Michael gradually became more alert, he was able to communicate with the staff. \u0002lthough he was still intubated, the morning rounds meeting moved from the hospital hallway into his room so that he could write his questions on a whiteboard. Once he could talk, he would speak to the staff at length about his condition and his care. \"It was a strange time,\" recalls Michael. \"\u0002 month before, I could bike 200 miles or more a week, and now it was a struggle to walk. The sta's encouragement and support were essential to my recovery.\" AN AMAZING RECOVERY In mid-October, three weeks aer he was admitted, Michael was discharged from RWJUH Somerset. ut his journey was far from over. He needed an internal defibrillator, triple bypass surgery and weeks of cardiac rehabilitation therapy. Finally, on March 2 ,201 ,Michael's hard work and perseverance paid off. He was able to hop on his bike again and ride 25 miles\u2014exactly six months to the day he had experienced his cardiac arrest. \"For this, I give thanks to everyone who cared for me and prayed for me at RWJUH Somerset last September,\" he says. In September 201 ,Michael completed the 5-mile ike MS: City to Shore Ride. \"It was harder than I expected, but I was so happy to be able to do it,\" says Michael. \"What carried me through was the thought that if people with MS struggle for life, I could struggle for a few hours to inish the ride.\" It's this positive spirit and determination that fueled Michael throughout most of his recovery. \"Not many cardiac arrest patients make this sort of recovery, and I believe a large part of Michael's success was due to the fact that he had so much love and support from his family, as well as a strong sense of optimism,\" says Dr. \u0002hn. \"\u0002 lot of cardiac patients become depressed and give up during the recovery process, but Michael was determined to make it every step of the way.\" For Michael, there's a special place in his heart for RWJUH Somerset. \"My wife and I still remember the name of every single staff member from the Critical Care Unit team,\" he says. On October ,he and Stefanie returned to RWJUH Somerset to bring breakfast to the staff. \"It was the anniversary of my reawakening\u2014the day I came out of the coma,\" says Michael. He presented staff members with a collage that had two photos: one of Michael while he was still in the coma and one of him at the MS bike event finish line. \"I wanted them to see how far I'd come, and how key they were to making sure I got there,\" he says.

While this is considered \"advanced maternal age,\" it's very possible to have a healthy baby. \u0002manda Francis, DO, an obstetriciangynecologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset and the RWJ arnabas Health Medical =roup's Roseland Ob=yn, explains how to prepare for pregnancy. What can a woman do to increase her odds of getting pregnant? The quality of a woman's eggs starts to decline between the ages of 5 and 0\u2014and markedly after 0\u2014but it's still possible to conceive and have a healthy pregnancy. Older maternal age increases the risks for the pregnancy and mother. The best way to mitigate any anxiety or concerns is to schedule a preconception visit. During this appointment, you and your obgyn can discuss any medical conditions you have and what you can do to prepare for pregnancy. How can you get in the best possible shape for pregnancy? Pregnancy is a time to optimize your health. This can be done through lifestyle changes like eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, staying up to date on recommended vaccines and having regular dental cleanings. In addition, it's important to have annual gynecologic checkups and take prenatal vitamins. Since many women don't ind out they're pregnant until they're seven or eight weeks along, it's important to take prenatal vitamins when you start trying to conceive. The most important component of these vitamins is folic acid, which can help prevent certain birth defects when taken in the irst 1 weeks of pregnancy (irst trimester). Once you're pregnant, how can you prepare for childbirth? While women who are 5 or older are at increased risk for health problems during pregnancy, good prenatal care can help identify many of those risks and possibly decrease some of the associated problems. When you see your obgyn, mention any physical and emotional changes\u2014from nausea and cravings to changes in mood and energy. \u0002lso, come to your appointments with questions. Write them down or put them in your smartphone. \u0002 birth plan is a great way to begin a discussion about labor and delivery. While pregnancy and childbirth are unpredictable by nature, a plan can address issues such as pain management so that you feel in control of the process as much as possible. What is unique about the maternity services at RWJUH Somerset? We provide personalized, high-quality care. Our anesthesiologists and neonatologists are on-call 2 ,and we have a ^evel II nursery, which can care for premature babies born as early as 2 weeks.

Stone, MD, Director of the Cardiac Catheterization and Interventional Lab at Community Medical Center in Toms River and a member of the RWJ arnabas Health medical group. \"In a cardiac arrest, the heart stops completely and no blood at all is circulating.\" Death can be instantaneous. Th e two things that determine survival, Dr. Stone explains, are the underlying pathology and the ow of blood to the brain. \"If someone passes out in front of you, take action immediately,\" he urges. \"Th e patient can't aff ord to lose the time that it may take for professional medical help to arrive.\" \u00fbuick action can double or even triple a cardiac arrest victim's chance for survival.HEART ATTACK WHAT IT IS \u0002 circulation problem. lood ow stops because of a blockage in an artery. Th e part of the heart muscle that is deprived of oxygen-rich blood begins to die. SYMPTOMS Th ese may begin hours, days or weeks in advance. Chest pain or feeling of pressure in the chest, possibly spreading to arms, neck, jaw, back or stomach. Feeling sick, sweaty or short of breath. Th e person having a heart attack will usually remain conscious. WHAT TO DO If you are having these symptoms, don't hesitate to contact your doctor or call 911. If someone you are with appears to be having a heart attack, call 911 immediately. Sit the person down and keep them calm while you wait for help.CARDIAC ARREST (CA) WHAT IT IS Usually, an electrical problem that causes the heart to stop pumping. C\u0002 can be trigg ered by a heart attack but can have other causes, such as an undiagnosed heart abnormality or cocaine or amphetamine use. SYMPTOMS Possibly racing heart or dizziness, but C\u0002 may occur without warning. \u0002 person suff ering C\u0002 will become unconscious and will not breathe normally, or breathe at all. WHAT TO DO Immediately call 911, or have someone else make the call while you perform the steps below. If an AED (automated external defi brillator) is available, begin use, following the prompts. Do CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). If you don't know conventional CPR (see below). HANDS-ONLY CPR Hands-only CPR can be done successfully even by someone who's not a professional. The idea is to push hard and fast in the center of the victim's chest to the beat of a familiar song that has 100 to 120 beats per minute. Think of the song \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees to help keep compressions in a regular rhythm.

TRAUMA OR ED? Hospital EDs take care of emergencies, of course, like heart attacks and breathing problems. EDs also deal with a broad range of noncritical conditions, such as the u or broken bones. \u0002 trauma center, however, has a larger scope than an ED.

Th is training includes close coordination with other trauma centers in case backup is needed. Th ere are 10 state-certifi ed trauma centers in New Jersey. HELP FOR SEVERE BURNS Trauma centers across the state coordinate closely with Th e urn Center at S MC, New Jersey's only state-certifi ed burn-treatment facility. In addition to burns from home accidents, industrial incidents and motor-vehicle crashes, one of the most common injuries the center sees\u2014up to 0 percent of cases\u2014is scalding in children under age 2 who have been splashed accidentally by a hot liquid. Specialists including burn technicians, nurses and respiratory therapists, as well as the most advanced technology, are available at the center at all times. \"If someone comes in with a surface burn, for example, we're able to immediately treat them with hydrotherapy\u2014water piped through special spigots that removes dead skin and bacteria to minimize the chance of infection,\" explains Michael Marano, MD, Medical Director o Th e urn Center. Th e center has 12 intensive care beds for the most critically injured patients and an 1-bed recovery unit. It also runs Th e Outpatient Center for Wound and urn Healing, which works with more than ,500 patients each year. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION In the hope of minimizing the need for their services, the trauma and burn centers put considerable resources into community education, covering the age spectrum from infants and car seats to geriatric fall prevention, as well as pedestrian safety, To learn more about safety education and training at RWJBarnabas Health hospitals, visit wwwrwbhorgcpr THE NEED FOR SPEED \"In trauma care, timing is everything,\" says Jim Smith, Vice President, Mobile Health Services and Patient Transport at RWJBarnabas Health (RWJBH). \"The gold standard is to have no more than 60 minutes from the time a patient has a traumatic emergency to the time he or she is in the OR.\" Depending on location and time of day, a trip that takes 45 minutes by road could be done by helicopter in 20 minutes. That's why RWJBH has partnered with Med-Trans aviation to provide a state-of-the-art Airbus 135 helicopter and two dispatch centers for live satellite tracking. Known as LifeFlight, the service includes on-scene and in-air emergency treatment and transportation to the closest appropriate state-certi ed trauma center. The crew includes RWJBH Emergency Medical Services fl ight nurses and paramedics who have had extensive training in emergency, air medical and trauma protocols. In addition to providing time-critical transportation from emergency events, the LifeFlight system transports patients as needed among RWJBH's 11 hospitals (and other health systems as appropriate). \"The service assists with continuity of care within the same network,\" Smith says. \"And although it can seem dramatic and scary for patients to hear they are being transported by helicopter, sometimes the issue is not so much medical acuity as it is timing and traf c.\" In either case, he says, \"It's important for New Jersey residents to know that, barring any weather issues, air medical services in the state are robust and coordinate closely with ground providers.

So is the rate of delivery-related \"severe maternal morbidity,\" which is deined as signiicant short- or long-term effects to a woman's health. \"In New Jersey, healthcare systems, community-based organizations and government agencies are tackling this issue head-on,\" says Suzanne Spernal, \u00c1ice President o Women's Services for RWJ arnabas Health (RWJ H). \"We're collectively looking at the entire continuum of healthcare to see what women want and need to be healthy before, during and a er pregnancy.\" EMPOWERING WOMEN Providing education is a priority. \"Th e majority of maternal adverse events don't happen on the day a woman gives birth,\" Spernal says. \"Th ey occur in the days and weeks that follow the birth, when mom is back at home and the warning signs of a serious complication may not be immediately recognized.\" To increase awareness, Tara's husband, Ryan, partnered with Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, an RWJ H facility, to create the Tara Hansen Foundation's \"Stop. ^ook. ^isten\" program. Th is initiative empowers women to voice any concerns they have and reminds providers to pay close attention, rather than assuming a symptom is a typical complaint of pregnancy or the postpartum period. Th e program has been embraced by facilities throughout RWJ H.ALERT IN THE ED RWJ H Emergency Departments (EDs) have created a system to ensure that any woman coming to an ED who has given birth within the previous 2 days is identifi ed, and a note made in her electronic health record. \"Care management for certain conditions can be quite diff erent for a woman who has recently given birth compared to a woman in the general population,\" Spernal says. \"Th is alert system quickly identifi es postpartum women and when minutes matter it can save lives.\" Other aspects of RWJ H's comprehensive approach to maternal health include: \u008e to improve pregnancy outcomes. \"Our hospitals are exploring the specifi c needs and challenges of women in their unique communities,\" Spernal says. \u008e so women, particularly those with medical conditions, can plan safer pregnancies.

While the three were walking home from her nephew's school, a vehicle had jumped the curb and struck them from behind. Olivia's mother and nephew suffered multiple fractures. Infant ^J, who had been in his car seat in a wagon being pulled by his grandmother, suffered the most extensive injuries as the car seat became dislodged and soared 0 feet away. \"When we inally got in to see ^J, he was on life support,\" Olivia recalls. \"He had multiple skull fractures, orbital fractures, severe brain trauma and a broken leg, and was having diiculty moving his right arm.\" ^J spent 21 days in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit before being transferred to the rain Injury Program at Children's Specialized Hospital (CSH) in New runswick. There, a team of specialists developed a customized rehabilitation program to address his medical, physical, cognitive and psychosocial needs. Within a week, however, his family and team realized something wasn't right with ^J. He was transferred to the Emergency Department at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New runswick, where a C\u0002T scan led to a diagnosis of hydrocephalus. With this condition, excess cerebrospinal luid builds up in the ventricles (cavities) of the brain and increases pressure within the head, causing head enlargement, headaches, impaired vision, cognitive diiculties and loss of coordination. \u0002 shunt was surgically inserted into a ventricle to drain the excess luid.SKILLS REGAINED ^J returned to CSH on February 11 to continue his rehabilitation journey. He quickly bonded with his inpatient team, particularly enjoying aquatic therapy. \"Once they got ^J into the pool, there was no stopping him,\" says Olivia. \"He loved it, and the resistance of the water forced him to start using his right arm more.\" ^J spent another two months at Children's Specialized working with physical, occupational, speech-language and recreational therapists. \"The progress he made at Children's Specialized was amazing,\" says Olivia. \"\u0002er the accident, he lost all of his muscle memory. The team worked with him day in and day out, helping him to learn how to roll, crawl, stand and walk.\" ^J went home on \u0002pril . He is now attending outpatient therapy sessions three days a week at the CSH location in Hamilton, working hard to build strength in his right arm and learn how to suck and swallow properly. \"We still keep in touch with the remarkable therapists and care team at Children's Specialized, updating them on ^J's progress,\" Olivia says. \"We're forever grateful for the care that Children's Specialized provided to our son.\" To learn more about Children's Specialized Hospital, call 888.244.5373 or visit www.childrens-specialized.org.^E\u0002RNIN= TO CRAWL AGAIN A BABY REBOUNDS FROM A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY WITH THE HELP OF CHILDREN'S SPECIALIZED HOSPITAL.From left to right, LJ Lopes in the at Children's Specialized Hospital; snuggling with his cousin Auggie; getting a boost from visiting Rutgers University football players.

She had been a runner for more than 40 years, but that summer she couldn't run more than a block without having to stop to walk. She had fevers, night sweats and a rash on her back. \"A friend was diagnosed with Lyme disease and her symptoms sounded like mine, so I made an appointment with an infectious disease specialist, and his phlebotomist took blood samples,\" she recalls. Within 24 hours, the doctor called back to explain that he had sent the blood test results to a hematologist who wanted her in his oice that day. \"I think you have leukemia,\" the hematologist told her. \"And I think you need to go to Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey in New Brunswick. Today.\" Lael's immune system was so suppressed that she was in a life-threatening situation. Within three days she would be admitted to RWJUH, where she would spend the next seven weeks undergoing chemotherapy. Dr. Patel has been by her side since then, along with a vast team of specialists from both It's a gorgeous day on the boardwalk in Bradley Beach and to look at the two smiling women, you would never guess that they had met in person for the very irst time just three days before. They exhibit a strong physical and emotional connection\u2014a bond worth life itself. \"I feel as if I'm with my daughter or my niece,\" Lael McGrath, 68, admits. She owes her life to Wiebke Rudolph, a 21-year-old recent college graduate from Kassel, Germany. Wiebke donated her stem cells anonymously to Lael after the retired second-grade teacher from Toms River was diagnosed with life-threatening acute myeloid leukemia in 2016. Both had looked forward to this meeting for more than two years.A STRANGER'S GIFT Healthy Together | 14 | Winter 2020 RWJBarnabas Health | RWJBH.ORG | 15 System_BMTPatient_Winter20_final.indd 14 12/11/19 2:53 PMRWJUH and Rutgers Cancer Institute. In the hospital, Lael's treatment involved the use of combination chemotherapy designed to get her into remission. \"However, the speciic mutations that we identiied in her leukemia were high-risk in nature, so we knew that chemotherapy alone would not keep her in remission,\" says Dr. Patel. \"We needed immune therapy in the form of an allogeneic stem cell transplant.\" SEARCHING FOR A DONOR In a bone marrow transplant, cells can be used from your own body, known as an autologous transplant. When cells are taken from a donor, the transplant is called allogeneic. \"In this procedure, the patient's diseased marrow is replaced with a donor's blood stem cells,\" says Dr. Patel. \"It allows for normal blood formation and provides a new immune system to help eliminate the leukemia. It also has the potential for a cure.\" \u0002t RWJUH, bone marrow transplant coordinator Mary Kate McGrath, MSN, RN, APN, BMTCN, OCN (no relation to ^ael), ran the results of ^ael's DN\u0002 testing through the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) registry. \"Within two months of Lael's diagnosis, we identiied three potential matches on the registry\u2014but Wiebke turned out to be the perfect match,\" she explains.Four thousand miles away in Germany, Wiebke was notiied that she matched a patient in dire need. \"Not that many people in Germany do this and certainly no one in my family or among my friends,\" she says. \" ut when I irst heard about this, I said yes, I'm going to do it. I was determined.\" Wiebke underwent peripheral blood stem cell donation, a procedure called apheresis, in which blood is removed through a needle in one arm and passed through a machine that collects only blood-forming cells. (The remaining blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm.) The procedure took six hours. All the logistics of harvesting Wiebke's stem cells and then transporting them to the U.S. were handled by NMDP. Meanwhile, Lael's repeat blood transfusions were made possible by the RWJUH lood Services team. Lael spent weeks in the hospital during the fall and winter of 2016, waiting for the transplant and being closely monitored by her healthcare team. Finally, in December 2016, she was notiied that her transplant was imminent. \"On December 16th, it happened,\" she recalls. \"A team walked in carrying a small cooler and within an hour, the transfusion was over. All I actually knew was that the donor was female and 19 years old.\" Lael did so well post-transplant that she was able to go home on New Year's Day 2017. Over in Germany, Wiebke was told that the transplant had gone well. Protocol and conidentiality policies don't permit donors and patients to have direct contact with each other until at least one year has passed. In this case, the wait lasted more than two years, until test results showed that Lael's blood cells were 100 percent \"donor.\" Not all donors and patients meet. But there was never any doubt for either of these two women. In fact, the pair started emailing, texting and then talking to each other on FaceTime right after being given each other's contact information. Recently, at a celebration hosted by RWJUH, both women held bouquets of owers and stood happily alongside one another. \"If it weren't for Wiebke, I don't know what would have happened,\" Lael says. With the breeze blowing off the Atlantic Ocean, these two women look knowingly at one another, smile and agree, \"It was a miracle.\" Opposite page, top, Lael and Wiebke with Vimal Patel, MD; this page, with members of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

It's a common syndrome\u2014thought to affect up to 10 million people in the U.S\u2014known as Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD. \"SAD is a kind of depression that happens at a speciic time of year, usually in the winter,\" explains psychiatrist Gabriel Kaplan, MD, Chief Medical Oicer of the RWJ arnabas Health ehavioral Health Network. Symptoms of SAD are similar to those of clinical depression, such as feelings of hopelessness, anxiety and problems with appetite. \"A couple of symptoms seem to be more common with SAD, however,\" says Dr. Kaplan. \"People with SAD often crave sweets more, and are more tired and sleep more.\" As with regular depression, there is help for those who suffer from SAD. WHY WINTER? While the exact cause of SAD is unknown, two hormones are implicated: melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep, and serotonin, a key hormone for mood stabilization. \"Melatonin tends to be produced when there's no sunlight,\" explains Dr. Kaplan. \"More melatonin means people feel sleepier.\" Conversely, sunlight tends to boost serotonin. A lack of light causes the brain to release less serotonin, which can lead to depression. \"We're not sure what makes some people vulnerable to SAD while others aren't greatly affected by less exposure to sunlight,\" says Dr. Kaplan. \"The theory is that people with SAD may have some form of imbalance in the regulation of these two hormones. Genetic factors may play a role in this.\" WHAT TO DO \"If you think you may have SAD, consult with a professional to determine whether your condition relates to that or to something else,\" advises Dr. Kaplan. \"Depression can be due to many different things, so it's better not to self- diagnose and possibly waste time on the wrong treatments.\" Having a healthy diet and regular exercise have been shown to improve symptoms of depression. Other possible treatments for SAD include: Light therapy. The patient sits or works near a device called a light therapy box, which gives off a bright light that mimics natural outdoor light. \"For some people, this treatment is very effective, but it's best to consult your physician about the type of device to use,\" says Dr. Kaplan. Cognitive behavioral therapy. This kind of psychotherapy, or \"talk therapy,\" focuses on changing inaccurate or negative thinking in order to create new behaviors. Antidepressant medication. \"Generally speaking, antidepressants don't start working for four to six weeks,\" says Dr. Kaplan. \"If your depression is seasonal, you may choose to take them for several months and then go off them when winter is over, or continue to take them for the rest of the year to prevent the reappearance of depression. It's the combined job of the doctor and patient to decide the best course.\" SEASONAL DEPRESSION IS A STRUGGLE, BUT HELP IS AVAILABLE.

Talk to friends, and it's likely that they have diff erent approaches to dieting. Here, Tia Hagins, RD, Community Nutritionist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset, explains the pros and cons of popular diets and off ers advice on how to eat for a healthier, thinner you. MEDITERRANEAN DIET Th is heart-healthy diet focuses on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy fats, such as olive oil. People who adhere to it consume plenty of seafood, beans, poultry and egg s and limit red meat. Th ey also eat whole wheat breads, cereals and pastas and substitute olive oil for butter. Dairy intake is moderate (just two to three servings per day).PROS: \"You can eat a variety of foods, and it's fi lling,\" says Hagins. Plus, it's a healthy way of eating: Th e Mediterranean diet helps to lower the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.CONS: If you have a sweet tooth, it can be challenging to stick with this way of eating because you have to cut out butter and solid fats. If you want to try the Mediterranean diet, make gradual changes. \"If you're used to drinking whole milk, try 2 percent milk fi rst,\" says Hagins. \"Once you're used to it, mix it with 1 percent milk. Eventually, you'll get used to the lower fat variety.\" KETOGENIC (\"KETO\") DIET Th is diet emphasizes foods high in fat and protein. Carb intake is restricted to less than 20 grams per day (one slice of bread is equivalent to about 15 grams of carbs). Th e premise is that your body will burn fat, rather than carbohydrates, for energy. Fat contains more calories than carbohydrates. \"Th is diet may help you lose body fat as well as weight,\" says Hagins.PROS: \"Th e keto diet regulates appetite so that you feel full for longer,\" says Hagins. \"It leads to weight loss.\"CONS: While the keto diet may be safe for healthy adults who want to lose weight quickly, it's not sustainable because it's so restrictive, says Hagins. \"You have to limit your carb and dairy intake drastically,\" she says. What's more, people shouldn't be on this diet without being monitored by their physician, says Hagins. \"Th e body can go into ketosis\u2014in which you use fat for energy instead of carbohydrates\u2014and it can aff ect the kidneys,\" she explains. \"People with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and kidney disease shouldn't follow this diet.\" WEIGHT WATCHERS FREESTYLE Th is diet emphasizes low-fat foods and lean protein, as well as healthy lifestyle changes. \"You can eat what you want,\" says Hagins. Foods are assigned points, and you are given a certain number for each day based on your weight-loss goal. More than 200 foods\u2014including beans, egg s and fi sh\u2014have no points. Dieters are encouraged to track their food choices and follow them online. \"Tracking food choices is a proven strategy for weight loss,\" says Hagins.PROS: It works. \"Th is is one of the most well-researched diets,\" says Hagins. Th e emphasis on nutritious, low-calorie foods like vegetables, fruits and whole grains can help lower blood pressure and reduce your risk for heart disease. In addition, Weight Watchers encourages physical activity and social support through meetings. No foods are forbidden, and you don't need to buy prepackaged foods. CONS: Membership isn't free, and if you overeat a food with zero points, then you might consume too many calories. HEALTHY SNACKING The following snacks are low in fat and calories: 5 whole grain crackers and 1 ounce of low-fat cheese (135 calories, 4 grams of fat) 2 four-inch rice cakes with 2 teaspoons peanut butter (125 calories, 6 grams of fat) 3 cups low-fat popcorn and 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese (135 calories, 3-5 grams of fat) \u00be cup low-fat, plain yogurt, \u00bd cup fruit (150 calories, 0-2 grams of fat) 1 apple and 1 ounce non-fat string cheese (125 calories, 3-5 grams of fat)7 KEY LIFESTYLE CHANGES Diets often lead to weight loss and gain (known as yo-yo dieting), which is unhealthy because it can strain your heart. \"To lose weight and keep it off over the long term, you need to make lifestyle changes,\" says Tia Hagins, RD, Community Nutritionist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset. Consider the following strategies for healthy weight loss: 1. Eat three meals per day with lean protein, fruits, vegetables, whole grains and dairy products. Visit www.choosemyplate.gov for a personalized diet based on your age, sex, height, weight and activity level. 2. Include a lean source of protein at every meal to keep hunger in check. 3. Choose low-fat foods and limit added fats. Consume 1 percent or fat-free milk and dairy products. If you must add fats to foods, keep portion size in mind: 1 teaspoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of salad dressing, for instance. 4. Decrease or eliminate drinks that contain sugar. Aim to drink 64 ounces of water daily instead. 5. Avoid eating large amounts of food late in the day. Ideally, 30 percent of calories should come from breakfast, lunch and dinner each, and 10 percent should come from snacks. 6. Don't skip meals because you'll overeat later. 7. Avoid eating after 8 p.m. TIA HAGINS, RD SECRETS TO SLIMMING DOWN Healthy Together | 18 | Winter 2020 Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Somerset | RWJBH.ORG/SOMERSET | 19 Somerset_Diets_Winter20_final.indd 19 12/12/19 3:44 PMLast summer, John Donohue, who has myopic degeneration\u2014an eye condition that leads to vision loss\u2014attended a conference for blind people in South Carolina, where he learned how to use a cane. During the meeting, the Somerville resident discovered a new technology called Aira, an app-based service that connects people with sight loss with remotely located agents who provide visual guidance. \"I'd never heard of it,\" says John, who worked in inance for 0 years and now volunteers at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) Somerset twice a week. \"I thought 'IRA' was a retirement account.\"IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE \u0002 er John returned from the conference, he learned that RWJUH Somerset had become the fi rst hospital in the nation to adopt the technology, which has been used by airports, grocery stores, parks and other businesses throughout the country.

John's role as a volunteer involves giving directions to patients who are looking for the hospital's cafeteria, coff ee shop or a classroom. \"I save people time,\" he says. When John fi rst started volunteering at the hospital 10 years ago, his vision was better, so he had no trouble guiding patients. Now he hopes to continue doing so with the Aira technology. \"I liken it to motorized wheelchairs for paraplegics,\" he says. \"It gives people with sight loss more freedom and independence.\"HIGH-TECH HELP FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED RWJUH SOMERSET IS OFFERING A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO ASSIST PATIENTS AND VISITORS WITH SIGHT LOSS.
