With the number of requests and rising APC fees , the fund has become very competitive, and the criteria and point system are essential in making award decisions. All the published articles with funding from OAAF are included in KU ScholarWorks , the University's institutional repository . This report includes the statistics for FY 20 22 in the following tables: Table 1. Numbers of applications and awards Table 2.

Oversight is provided by the sponsors who support the fund - KU's Provost, KU's Vice Chancellor for Research, and the KU Medical Center's Vice Chancellor for Researc h. Detailed criteria and eligibility standards, an online application form, a list of awards made, and additional information is available at this URL: http://library.kumc.edu/authors -fund.xml . The OAAF began its first two -year pilot program in October of 2012 with $50,000 allocated equally by the Lawrence campus and the Medical Center. During that first pilot, which closed at the end of June 2014, applications were reviewed on a first -come, first -served basis. This resulted in the entire years' worth of funds being dispersed within four to six months of the opening of the fund. To ensure that money would be available for an entire fiscal year during the second pilot phase (2014 -2016), the OAAF Revie w Team solicited the advice of the members of the Faculty Consultation Group. Additional criteria, new eligibility standards, and different review periods were developed. In the redesigned competitive process, all the applications received during one month are now reviewed within the first seven business days of the next month. Various levels of weighted priority are now assigned as follows: A. Author 's status (graduate student, pre -tenured faculty, early career research staff, etc.) B. Author's access to grants or other funding C. Author's record of previous OA awards received This second phase of the pilot began in November 2014 with a new allocation of $50,000 to cover 2014 -2016. Awards were made using the new criteria and procedures. The fund subsequently received $50,000 in July 2016 , July 2018 , and July 2020 . In September 2 022, the Fund received $72,000 for distribution in FY23 and FY24 . The fund will continue to distribute awards through June 20 24. The number of fund applications has ranged between two and nine each month, out of which an average of one to three are approved. In March 2021 there was a record of 14 applications . All the articles that are paid for (at least in part) by the OAAF are now available for viewing at the OAAF website here - http://library.kumc.edu/oa -fund -awards.xml . The same articles are also added to the https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/11673 KU ScholarWorks , the University's institutional repository . The OAAF is marketed to faculty and graduate students through our website, social media, email, and group presentations. FY 2023 & 2024 The current two-year OAAF cycle expires June 30, 2024. The OAAF asked for and was granted an increase in funding from $25,000 to $36,000 from each campus to cover FY23 and FY 24 5 awards. This will allow the OAAF to increase the payment cap for the APC fees to $2,000 . Please note that t he Sponsors have expressed concerns about the distribution criteria and the continuation of the Fund considering the changing Open Access landscape and the rise of transformative agreements. 6 Appendix B Cumulative Statistics Totals, Inception - June 20 22 The following tables document the outcomes of the OAAF applications and awards process from the inception of the fund (Oct. 2012) through the end of the tenth year ( June 20 22).
