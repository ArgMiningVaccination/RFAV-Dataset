Introduction Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been extensively used in the prevention and treatment of various human diseases, and also offers a great resource for modern drug discovery and develop- ment. Many U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approveddrugs, such as artemisinin from Herba Artemisiae as an anti-asthmatic drug3, were derived from TCM. Notably, the clinical efcacy and safety of various TCM formulas, such asHuashi Baidu Granules, Xuanfei Baidu Granules, etc., for the treatment of COVID-19 have also been veried by accumulating high-quality clinical trials. 4e7Recently, big data and articial intelligence technologies have driven the rapid development of TCM.8To better dissect the pharmacological mechanisms and identify the active ingredients in TCM, we originally establishedan Encyclopaedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM) in 2019 9, which has been highly recognized among pharmacologists and scholars in TCM researches worldwide. Since then, severalTCM-related databases, such as HERB 10, SuperTCM11and HIT 2.012, have been constructed and provided useful data and tools for TCM-based research and drug discovery. However, they are still insufcient in data standardization, integrity and precision. Noneof the existing databases provide the quality control information of Chinese patent drugs and herbs which may be one of the most important factors for the effectiveness of TCM, and the similarityevaluation data among various TCM formulas/Chinese patent drugs/herbs/ingredients which may be useful in summarizing the rules of prescription use and nding alternative drugs for endan-gered Chinese medicinal materials. Therefore, a database with more comprehensive and accurate recording related data and in- formation is in demand. In the updated ETCM v2.0 (freely accessible at http://www. tcmip.cn/ETCM2/front/#/ ) as shown in Fig. 1 , the original data is largely expanded while a new data eld \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas\" based on ancient Chinese medical books hasbeen added, and a novel method for target identication and pre- diction has been utilized. Currently, ETCM v2.0 hosts 48,442 TCM formulas recorded by ancient Chinese medical books, 9872 Chinesepatent drugs, 2079 Chinese medicinal materials and 38,298 in- gredients, 1040 conrmed or potential drug targets, as well as 8045 related diseases. Moreover, ETCM v2.0 also provides variouspairwise associations and cross retrievals between different datasections by combing diverse strategies including database mining, reference mining and bioinformatics mining. This new release provides more comprehensive and more efcient TCM informationwith downloadable and visualized knowledge graphs, which mayfacilitate the deep mining of implicit knowledge on TCM, and the systematic integration of TCM with modern medicine at both mo- lecular and phenotypic levels ( Fig. 1 ). 2. Data updates and extensionsETCM v2.0 is composed of six data sections, including TCM formulas recorded by ancient Chinese medical books, Chinese patent drugs, Chinese medicinal materials, ingredients, targets and diseases as summarized in Table 1 . 2.1. The TCM formula and Chinese patent drug information TCM formulas were originated from the clinical experience of TCM during the thousands of years. A large number of ancient TCM formulas were recorded in ancient books by different doc-tors in different dynasties, which may be the source of research and development of new TCM-based drugs. At present, some TCM formulas are still widely used with denite curative effects,obvious characteristics and advantages. To this end, the Chinese governments have promulgated the \"rst batch of ancient classic famous prescriptions catalogue\" (including 100 TCM formulas)and promoted their listing as proprietary TCM formulas. Espe-cially, some of them have been developed into Chinese patent drugs. Since 1985, more than 10,000 Chinese patent drugs have been approved for marketing, and have become the mainstreamproduct in TCM market and one of the three pillar industries of Chinese pharmaceutical industry along with biological drugs and chemical drugs. In this context, a completely new data section wasintegrated to ETCM v2.0, namely \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas\". The most comprehensive list of 48,442 TCM formulas (including the rst batch of 100 proprietary TCM formulas) and9872 Chinese patent drugs with manually integrating and normalizing information respectively obtained from ancient Chi- nese medical books and package insert of drugs are provided.Notably, the TCM formula/Chinese patent drug-related clinicaldata, such as the corresponding symptoms and syndromes, and clinical efcacy were standardized to obtain accurate query re- sults. Both the chemical proling and target proling of eachTCM formula/Chinese patent drug, as well as the quantitative information of marker ingredients, the related properties and functional information are also provided. 2.2. The Chinese medicinal materials information The number of herbs has increased from 403 (ETCM) to 2005 (ETCM v2.0), which includes 548 commonly used herbs recorded2560 Yanqiong Zhang et al.in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 version) and investigated in the Fourth National Survey on Chinese Materia Medica Resources(http://www.zyzypc.com.cn /). In addition, 44 animal medicines and 30 mineral medicines are also included. The general and drug effectiveness-related information, including the name, type, spe- cies, collection time, property, flavor, meridian tropism, indica-tion, specication, medicinal part, classication based on efcacy, references and habitat map of Chinese medicinal materials, are provided. Of note, the quantitative information of marker in-gredients of each herb is provided according to the Chinese pharmacopoeia (2020 version), which are necessary for herbal quality control. Moreover, the cross-links of herbs to HERB,HIT2.0 and SymMap databases are also established in herbal detailed information page.2.3. The ingredient information The ingredients of herbs, TCM formulas and Chinese patent drugs recorded in ETCM v2.0 were collected manually according to the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (2020 version) and other literatures. The number of ingredients has increasedfrom 7274 (ETCM) to (ETCM For each ingredient, its name, 18 physicochemical properties [molecular formula, molecular weight, volume, density, number of hydrogen bondacceptors (nHA), number of hydrogen bond donors bonds (nRot), number of rings the (MaxRing), number of het-eroatoms (nHet), formal charge (nRig), number of stereocenters, topological polar Figure 1 The schema and objectives of ETCM v2.0. This database includes 48,442 TCM formulas recorded by ancient Chinese medical books, 9872 Chinese patent drugs, 2079 Chinese medicinal materials and 38,298 ingredients. Functionally, ETCM v2.0 may be a major data warehousefor the quality marker identication of TCMs, the TCM-derived drug discovery and repurposing, and the pharmacological mechanism investi- of TCMs database for research 2561surface area (TPSA), the logarithm of aqueous solubility value (logS), the logarithm of the n-octanol/water distribution coef- cient (log P), the logarithm of the n-octanol/water distribution coefcients at pH Z7.4 (log D7.4)], 6 medicinal chemistry properties [quantitative estimate bioavailability(F20%), plasma protein binding (PPB), volume distribution (VD), penetration blood brain barrier penetration (BBB), T1/2],32 [FAF-drugs 4 rule, rat oral acute toxicity, hERG blockers, the human hepatotoxicity (H- HT), drug-induced domain-containing protein 5 (SR-ATAD5), SR-p53] calculated by the robust and accurate models in ADMETlab 2.0 13(https://admetmesh.scbdd.com /) are provided. Especially, the drug- likeness based on desirability (QED)14e16and the maximum recommended daily dose by FDA (FDAMDD)17of herbal in- gredients are provided to evaluate the potentials and the safety as drug candidates, respectively. Among them, the mean QED is 0.67 for the attractive compounds and 0.49 for the unattractive com-pounds. Thus, we classied all 38,298 ingredients collected inETCM v2.0 into three groups according to their QED scores, (QED >0.67), medium (0.49 /C20QED/C200.67) and poor (QED<0.49). FDAMDD provides an estimate of the toxic dose threshold of chemicals in humans. The output value of FDAMDD is the probability of being toxic, within the range of 0 e1. Our ingredients are divided into excellent (0 /C20FDAMDD /C200.3), medium (0.3 <FDAMDD /C200.7) and poor (FDAMDD >0.7). 2.4. The target information ETCM v2.0 provides the detailed information on the conrmed and/or potential targets for ingredients, herbs, Chinese patent drugs and TCM formulas to facilitate the mechanistic study ofTCM and the new drug discovery. We improved the target iden-tication method in ETCM v2.0 based on a two-dimensional ligand similarity search module in our indoor D3CARP platform (the article of D3CARP will be submitted and published in thenear future) and the BindingDB database 18(updated on 2021-11- 01) ( Fig. 2 ). Specically, the platform ligand database is derived from the BindingDB database, which is a public, web-accessibledatabase of measured binding afnities and containsTable 1 Content statistics of ETCM v2.0.

If the calculated similarity value is 1.0, the targets of the referencecompound are considered as the conrmed targets for the sub- mitted ingredient. If the calculated similarity value is between 0.8 and 1.0, the targets of the reference compound are considered aspotential targets of the submitted ingredient. Notably, the binding activities between each ingredient and its targets are also provided to facilitate the identication of bioactive compounds and theinvestigation of pharmacological mechanisms of TCMs. Comparing with the existing TCM target prediction tools mainly based on manual retrieval or intelligent retrieval 10,12,19e23, our method may obtain more sufcient and more reliable target in- formation under the appropriate similarity threshold. Moreover, the biological functions and participated pathways of theconrmed and/or potential targets of ingredients/herbs/Chinesepatent drugs/TCM formulas are also provided according to the enrichment analysis based on the Gene Ontology 24and Reactome pathway database25using in house python scripts with hyper- geometric test. 2.5. The disease information The number of human diseases has increased from 2266 (ETCM) to 8045 (ETCM v2.0). The detailed information of each disease,including disease name, global category, anatomical category, symptoms, disease-related genes and hallmark gene set annota- tions, collected from the human disease database (MalaCardsv5.0) 26, Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO, Released in 2018)27, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM, Released in April 2018)28, Database of gene-disease associations (DisGeNET v5.0)29, the portal for rare diseases and orphan drugs (ORPHA- NET v5.49.0)30. The inconsistent gene or protein IDs of different resources were manually inspected and converted into Ofcial Gene Symbols and UniProt Accession Numbers. The diseases arelinked to ingredients, herbs, Chinese patent drugs and TCM for- mulas according to the enrichment analysis based on the disease- causing genes and the conrm/potential drug target genes using inhouse python scripts with hypergeometric test. 3. Direct associations & indirect associations among various data elds ETCM v2.0 provides comprehensive pairwise associations and cross retrievals between different data sections by combing diverse strategies including database mining, reference mining and bioinformatics mining ( Fig. 3 ). We manually collected a total of 14 direct associations of \"TCM from Chinese medical books, package insert ofdrugs and Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 version). Among them, the modern diseases, TCM syndromes and clinical symptoms associated with TCM formulas, Chinese patent drugs and herbsare rigorously standardized by clinical expert consensus and subsequent manual verication. The direct associations for \"Ingredient-Referenced Target\" were identied based on a two-dimensional ligand similarity search module in our indoor D3CARP platform and the BindingDB database 18. In addition to the above direct associations involving adjacent characteristic parameters, there are also ve indirect associations involving non-adjacent parameters, such as associations between TCM formula/Chinese patent drugs and ingredients were obtained using herbs as the middle parameters. Based on the Ingredient-Referenced Target relationship, the TCM formulas/Chinese pat- ent drugs/Herbs were connected to the referenced targets. 4. Drug similarity evaluation The Jaccard similarity scores among different TCM formulas, Chinese patent drugs and herbs calculated based on their herb compositions, chemical and target prolings are provided in the corresponding sections of ETCM v2.0. In each detailed informa-tion page, ve TCM formulas/Chinese patent drugs/herbs with the highest similarity to the submitted TCM formula/Chinese patent drug/herb are displayed and also can be linked to their respectivedetailed information pages ( Fig. 4 ). These similarity evaluation data may be of signicance to identify prescriptions/herbs with similar clinical efcacy, to summarize the rules of prescription use, and to nd alternative herbs for endangered Chinese medic-inal materials. 5. Improved browsing and inquiry functions ETCM v2.0 not only includes detailed medicinal properties of TCM formulas, Chinese patent drugs, herbs and ingredients, butalso provides potential links between TCM with target genes and modern diseases to facilitate TCM related basic researches, clin- ical applications and drug development. It offers the browse andsearch pages for users to navigate each data section, and provides the examples and the types of searchable keywords in or below the search menu. For the novel data section \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas\" added in ETCM v2.0, we provide additional browsing and searching pages. All 48,442 TCM formulas are classiedaccording to their dosage forms (such as powder preparation, decoction, pill preparation, etc .) and their source of ancient Chi- nese medical books (such as \"ShenJiZongLu\", \"TaiPing-ShengHuiFang\", \"PuJiFang\", etc .), which are presented in the browse page of the \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Formulas\" section. Users can view a full list of all TCM formulas belonging to each category by clicking on each above mentioned category.Detailed information of each TCM formula can be retrieved by clicking on its Chinese or Pinyin name, including dosage form, herb-chemical ingredient-target proling, indications, major syn-dromes and main symptoms treated by the formula, the source ancient books of TCM, etc. Users can link to the information pages of the herbs, chemical ingredients and targets by clickingthe corresponding name in the TCM formula information page. Itis worth to note that the TCM formula indication information is described according to the records in the ancient books of TCM, these indications are different from modern diseases, therefore wetried to use genes related to both TCM ingredients and modern diseases to build the links between TCM formula indications and modern diseases. Similarly, TCM formulas collected in the ETCMAn updated ETCM v2.0 database for TCM research 2563Figure 2 Pipeline of ETCM v2.0 target identication and prediction, and detailed information of target genes of a certain ingredient. To facilitate the mechanistic research and new drug discovery, the target identication method of ETCM v2.0 was improved based on a two- dimensional ligand similarity search module, which provides the conrmed and/or potential targets of each ingredient, as well as their bind-ing activities.2564 Yanqiong Zhang et al.v2.0 database are also classied based on the corresponding TCM syndromes, such as blood deciency, heat syndrome, etc. To facilitate the understanding of TCM functions from the modern science point of view, we improved our target identicationmodel for ingredients of the collected herbs, TCM formulas and Chinese patent drugs according to the two-dimensional ligand similarity search module between TCM ingredients and ligandsderived from the BindingDB database, and considered the target genes of ligands as the conrmed and/or potential targets of TCM ingredients based on the calculated similarity values. Besides theinformation of the target proling, the binding activities between each herbal ingredient and its targets are also provided ( Fig. 5 ). Moreover, the collective targets of all ingredients of a herb, a TCMformula or a Chinese patent drug are indicated as the conrmed and/or potential targets of the herb, TCM formula or Chinese patent drug. Diseases signicantly associated with those target genes in the enrichment analysis are also shown as diseases that may be cured bythe herbs, TCM formulas or Chinese patent drugs. Gene Ontology terms or pathways enriched by genes targeted by certainingredients, herbs, TCM formulas, Chinese patent drugs or asso- ciated with certain diseases, are also included in ETCM v2.0 (Fig. 5 ). 6. Enhanced network visualization capabilities To better illustrate the relationships among TCM formulas, Chi- nese patent drugs, herbs, ingredients, target genes, gene-involvedpathways and diseases, ETCM v2.0 provides an enhanced JavaScript-based network visualization tool for creating, modi- fying, and exploring multi-scale biological networks, which maybe the characteristic function of our database and not available inother databases of the same type, such as HERB 10, SuperTCM11 and HIT 2.012, YaTCM31, TCMID 2.019and TCMSP32. Users are allowed to choose to display relationships among TCM for-mulas, Chinese patent drugs, herbs, ingredients, targets, disease- related genes, and diseases according to their research aims, as well as design, add, delete, shape, and edit the details of networknodes and edges as they like ( Fig. 6 ).

Discussion With a long history of widespread clinical applications, TCM has made important contributions to the prosperity of human beings, especially in East Asia. In recent years, TCM has also beenfrequently used in Western countries. On the basis of the systematic associations among TCM formulas, Chinese patent drugs, herbs, ingredients, targets and diseases, TCM gives specic prescriptionsto each individual patient according to their disease conditions,which may be consistent with the goals of precision medicine. Although a growing number of TCM databases have been estab- lished with various data sources and similar functions, they may belack of standardization and comprehensiveness. Herein, ETCM v2.0 is the latest curated database focusing on comprehensive resource and rich annotations for the TCM-derived drug discoveryand repurposing, and the investigation of underlying mechanisms of TCMs against various human diseases ( Table 2 ). Using ETCM v2.0, researchers and drug developers can view primary data as well as the data- and algorithm-driven mappingresults among TCM formulas/Chinese patent drugs, herbs, in- gredients, targets and diseases, allowing easy identication of new potentially effective therapeutics and discovery of novel drugcombination with synergistic effects. In addition, ETCM v2.0 offers the ingredients of Chinese herbs and prescriptions, and the evaluation results on their drug-likeness and safety, as well as theconrmed and/or potential target lists and the corresponding biological function enrichment analysis, which may be helpful in discovering the novel drug candidates. Polypharmacological prediction of known TCM prescriptions by the similarity comparison based on herbal compositions, chemical and target proling is very useful to nd new therapeuticapplications of existing TCM prescriptions and to discover multi-target drugs with improved efcacies. ETCM v2.0 provides highly similar TCM formulas/Chinese patent drugs/herbs/ingredients and the corresponding similar scores which may help screening TCMsthat connect to targets of known drugs and discovering their new therapeutic effects. Accumulating studies have revealed that TCM network phar- macology may play a crucial role in elucidating the network-based biological basis of complex diseases, TCM formula and herb therapeutics 38,39, and the rst international standard of network pharmacology dNetwork Pharmacology Evaluation Method Guidance has been issued40. On this context, ETCM v2.0 also provides the conrmed and/or potential drug targets, the disease- related genes, and the interactions among them, as well as user-friendly network visualization, which all may be of great signi- cance to promote the exploration of the \"multi-component, multi- target and multi-pathway\" integrated therapeutic paradigm ofTCM medicinal prescriptions.
