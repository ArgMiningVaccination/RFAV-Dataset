That's why we created Teeth Tamer! Teeth Tamer is a whole clove tincture fit for babies through adults. Many in the natural community have suggested using clove essential oil on teething baby gums, but that is actually dangerous for babies, even if diluted, due to the chemical constituents in clove essential oil. We decided to make a whole clove tincture because clove is known for its anti-inflammatory and numbing properties. A whole clove tincture is not dangerous for babies and is still effective at relieving symptoms of teething discomfort. We also added in catnip as a calming agent to help soothe fussy teething babies. When clove and catnip combine in our tincture, your baby will have a soothing herbal remedy for those tough teething days. Benefits: - Helps with tooth pain - Helps reduce swelling - Antibacterial properties - Provides sense of calmness - Liquid benefits (vitamins and minerals are easier to digest and provide more benefits than tablets, where binders and fillers must first be broken down) - Safe to give babies due to using the whole herb clove rather than the harmful essential oil - Alcohol-free Don't love your product?
