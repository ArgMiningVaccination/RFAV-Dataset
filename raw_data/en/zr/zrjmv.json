Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 2 INTRODUCTION In British Columbia (BC) , all cases of hepatitis C that have not yet been entered into the electronic public health information system require documentation , geographical attribution and consideration for follow -up care. This g uideline aims to meet the needs of BC health care professionals who are following -up individuals with newly identified hepatitis C infection. To meet the needs of the Regional Health Authorities (RHA's) and the communities they serve, this document presen ts information in a flexible way, to encourage client engagement with the health care system. Follow -up may occur directly by public health personnel with a client or indirectly through a primary care provider who is already engaged with the client. 1.1 Authority Hepatitis C virus is a reportable condition under the Public Health Act (2008) and Schedule A of the Health Act Communicable Disease Regulation . 1.2 Rationale for HCV Follow Up Follow up of people with newly identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection s can contribute to positive outcomes for both the individual a nd the community. This is a key moment in which counselling can be offered for alcohol and substance use, including harm reduction services, overdose prevention and naloxone training, and opioid substitution therapies , where appropriate . Clients can be engaged into care to provide information around treatment, transmission prevention , housing and education around diet, immunization updates and screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . 1.3 Goals To provide public health personnel and primary care providers with information to: Prevent transmission of hepatitis C infection . Prevent newly identified HCV cases from acquiring coinfections , including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV) and Hepatitis A (HAV) . Provide education and counselling to individuals infected with HCV and their contacts . Reduce harms . This includes c onnect ing individuals living with HCV infection with harm reduction prevention and support resources , where appropriate . Resources include distribution sites for harm reduction supplies, supervised injection facilities, detox and treatment facilities , opioid agonist therapies (e.g., Buprenorphine/naloxone therapy, m ethadone maintenance therapy (MMT)) , and mental health and outreach programs . Educate n ew HCV cases about risks associated with HBV coinfection if engaging in activities more likely to result in exposure to HBV, such as intravenous drug use (IDU) and condomless sex with m ultiple partners . Immunize for hepatitis B to reduce morbidity rates of cirrhosis and hepatoc ellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with coinfection (1). Increase engagement of clients who h ave and who are at risk of HCV infection , into the cascade of care (see Figure 6 -1). Increase access to treatment for clients with HCV infection . Prevent adverse sequelae in infants born to mothers who have HCV infection , by timely identif ication of cases of HCV vertical transmission . Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 3 2.0 DEFINITIONS Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) - Enzyme prod uced by the liver. Increased levels indicate inflammation of the liver, but do not always correlate with the severity of the disease process. Attribution - Refers to the geographic area (e.g. R egional Health Authority (RHA) , outside of BC) for the purpose of surveillance reporting. Case - Defined here for the purpose s of surveillance . Clinical criteria are not required. Laboratory criteria : Acute Case (adults, adolescents & children > 18 months ): o Anti-HCV positive or HCV RNA positive AND o There is an anti -HCV negative test result o n record in the prior 12 months Chronic case : o HCV RNA positive AND o There is an anti -HCV negative test result on record more than 12 months ago OR there is no documentation available of a prior anti -HCV result Case - Children 18 months of age: o HCV RNA positive 4 to 6 weeks of age OR o Anti-HCV positive at 18 months of age Cases may be further staged depending on the type of electronic public health information system being used in the RHA. See Table 5 -1 for staging information specifi c to Panorama. Case definitions are also available on the BCCDC website . Contact - Includes any individual who has had a percutaneous or mucosal exposure to the blood or blood products of an individual living with HCV infection . Direct Acting Anti -Virals (DAA s) - Oral drug formulations used for hepatitis C treatment , that target HCV at various stages in the HCV lifecycle (2). Current therapies combine different DAA classes to avoid resistance. Documentation - Recording of results and follow -up care provided to those testing fo r HCV. Guidelines may vary by RHA and agency. Genotype - There are now 8 genotypes and numerous subtypes of HCV currently identified , of which genotypes 1, 2 and 3 are the most common in North America and BC. With increasing availability of pangenotypic DAA's, the relevance of genotype to treatment selection is becoming less r elevant. HCV Antibody Test (anti -HCV) - HCV antibodies are produced when an individual is exposed to HCV and usually remain present for life. Anti -HCV becomes detecta ble 5 -10 weeks after infection, and confirms that the individual has been infected at som e time. Iatrogenic - Unintenti onal and unfavourable response to a medical treatment or procedure caused by a healthcare provider. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 4 Immuno compromised - Where the immune response is attenuated by the administration of immunosuppressive therapy, malnutrition or disease processes. Those who have HIV in fection and CD4+ cell count < 50 cells/mm3, chronic kidney infection, or who have been on long -term immune suppressants may not be able to mount a normal antibody response to HCV . Those with agammaglobulinemia are unable to make their own antibodies. Liver fibrosis - An accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins that are produced in excess, inefficiently broken down, or both. Healthy liver cells are replaced with fibrous tis sue, leading to disruption of normal liver function . Main causes include chronic hepatitis B or C infection, excessive alcohol intake (>2 -3 drinks/day) and non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with obesity, diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Autoimmune hepatitis can also lead to chronic liver inflammation. Symptoms may not be present unless there is severe damage to liver function (3). May be classified according to a histologic scoring system, such as M ETAVIR (6): F0 = no fibrosis F1 = portal fibrosis septa F2 = portal fibrosis with few septa without Cirrhosis - Progression of fibrosis to scarring and disruption of normally functioning structures in the liver. The presence of extens ive 'bridging fibrosis' between portal -vascular structures on liver histology can confirm this diagnosis. It can be predicted by non -invasive investigations, such as Fibro scan\u00ae. Advanced cirrhosis is supported by marked coagulopathy, portal hypertension, ascites and liver failur e (4). The gold standard for determining the severity of liver damage is liver biopsy. Non-invasive alternative tools to measure liver fibrosis : o Fibroscan\u00ae (Transient Elastography) - Ultrasound method that correlates with liver stiffness, and can be used to detect advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Results can be influenced by hepatic inflammation, obesity (less reliable results in BMI 25 -28 kg/m2), ascites , narrow intercostal spaces, and central venous pressure . These results can be correlated with the METAVIR scoring system (4). o Aspartate Aminotransferase -to-Platelet ratio index (APRI) - An indirect method used to predict significant and severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. APRI score > 1. 5 indicates significant fibrosis or cirrhosis , and APRI < 0.7 indicates no significant fibrosis (3). For an online calculator, s ee http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/page/clinical -calculators/apri Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 5 o FIB-4 - An indirect method used to help with liver fibrosis staging. FIB-4 < 1.45 indicates no significant fibrosis , and FIB-4 > 3.25 is predictive of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (3). For an online calculator, s ee - Detects HCV RNA, confirming active infection. HCV RNA becomes detectable at 1 -3 weeks post exposure. It does not determine the severity of liver d amage. Percutaneous Exposure - Contact through the skin with blood (e.g., sharing of needles used for IDU). Non- intact skin exposur e when blood or body fluid comes in contact with a wound < 3 days old, or with skin having compromised integrity (e.g. , dermatitis, ab rasions or other lesions). Perinatal Exposure - Infection of an infant at birth from a mother. The likelihood of HCV transmission to the infant depends on the viral load of the mother . Coinfection with HIV in the mother may increase the odds of transmission to the infant by approximately 3 -fold (5). Period of Communicability - All persons who are anti -HCV reactive are considered infectious unless there i s documentation of a spontaneously resolved infection or virological cure by treatment . Permucosal Exposure - Contact of the mucous membrane lining body cavities of eyes, nose, mouth, vagina, rectum or urethra with blood or body fluids. Reactivation - Increase in HBV replication in an individual with HBsAg -positive chronic HBV infection or resolved HBV chronic hepatitis can reactivate following HBeAg seroconversion. Can occur spontaneously or after initiation of immune suppr essing therapy (e.g., rituximab, HIV -related immunosuppression), corticosteroid therapy, immune modulation therapy, solid organ transplant or organ transplant recipients (6). Resolved Infection - HCV infections may resolve spontaneously (usually within 6 months of infection ) or following a course of antiviral therapy , resulting in a sustained virological response (SVR) indicating that the patient has cleared the virus. Individuals with resolved infection typically have serum that is anti -HCV reactive , but have no detectable HCV R NA. Resolved infection is confirmed after one negative HCV RNA test. If exposure is suspected to have occurred within the past 6 months, repeat HCV RNA testing 6 months after the estimated time of infection. Seroconversion - An immune response characterized by a change from the absence of HCV antibodies (anti-HCV non -reactive) to the presence of HCV antibodies (anti -HCV reactive) in the serum of an individual at any time. Sustained virologic response (SVR) - No detectable HC V RNA in plasma 12 weeks (SVR12) after treatment completion. In the pas t, SVR was measured at 24 weeks after treatment completion (7). Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 6 3.0 HEPATITIS C VIRUS Hepatitis C is a virus that can cause chronic liver disease. HCV is a single -stranded , enveloped, linear RNA virus from the Flaviviridae family. HCV is a blood -borne virus that is highly transmissible via percutaneous exposures to infectious blood. Permucosal transmission may occur if blood is present , but is not as efficient. 3.1 Clinical Description Most people (75%) who have just become infected with HCV have no symptoms. The remaining 25% may experience fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle aches, fever, nausea, or vague abdominal pain beginning approximately 6 -7 weeks after infection and resolving after a few weeks. Jaundice , pale stools, and dark- coloured urine occur in less than 10% of cases. Individuals with newly acquired HCV infection may have elevated serum ALT levels . In very rare instances, severe and rapid ly progressing hepatocellular death and hepatic failure may develop (fulminant hepatitis). Figure 3 -1: Natural history of HCV infection (6, 8-11) Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 7 Approximately 75% of cases b ecome chronically infected, while 25% will naturally clear the virus (spontaneous clearance or resolved infection) (12). A BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC -HTC) study looking at reinfected individ uals reported a spontaneous re -clearance rate of 34%, although reinfection with a heterologous genotype and a history of problematic alcohol use were associated with a reduced rate of spontaneous re -clearance (13). Among those with chronic infection, most remain asymptomatic for y ears, while some individuals will experience fatigue, depression, lethargy, digestive problems and/or other extrahepatic manifestations. Over decades, 10% -20% will develop cirrhosis . HCV is a cirrhosis, liver disease (ESLD) , and Along with HCC and alcoholic cirrhosis, HCV infection is a major cause of liver transplantation in Canada (14). Cirrhosis is a condition that results from damage or scarring of the liver. This may be reversible in early stages, if the underlying cause is treated. It is the end - stage of many different forms of liver disease and is known to cause a number of other health problems, including variceal hepatic encephalopathy . Approximately of all chronically infected individuals will develop HCC within two decades. Factors that accelerate liver disease include alcohol consumption (>2 -3 drinks per day), older age at the time of infection (> 40 years old), male gender, obesity, and coinfecti on with HIV or HBV (15, 16) . Individuals living with chronic HCV infection have an increased risk of fulminant hepatitis if they are acutely infected with HAV. 3.2 Epidemiology Refer to the BCCDC Reportable Diseases Data Dashb oard for the most up to date information. Figure 3 -2: Annual rates of newly diagnosed HCV cases in BC and Canada (2009 -2018 ) Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 8 After the discovery of hepatitis A (1973) (17) and hepatitis B (1963) (18), it became clear that many cases of hepatitis that occurred followin g blood transfusions were due to neither hepatitis A or B. By the mid -1970's, the term \"non -A, non -B hepatitis\" was used to refer to the virus presumed responsible for these infections. In 1989 the virus was identified and renamed hepatitis C (19, 20) . As a result of this discovery and subsequent work to detect infection, Canadian Blood Services has implemented anti-HCV screening of all blood donors since 1990 and HCV NAT testing since October 1999 (21). Between 230,000 -450,000 (0.66% -1.3%) Canadians were HCV -infected in 2011 (22-24). A retrospective modeling study estimated the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C in BC to be 1.04%, of which 33.4% remained undiagnosed, compared to 0.91% in Ontario , of which 36.0% remained undiagnosed in 2014 (25). The annual rate of newly diagnosed HCV cases (acute and chronic) reported in BC has declined over the last decade but remains considerably above the Canadian rate. In 2017, the rate of newly diagnosed HCV cases was 46. 5 per 100,000 population in BC, and 31.6 per 100,000 in Canada (see Figure 3 -2) (15). In 2018, the overall rate of HCV infection in BC was 39.3 cases per 100,000 people. Northern Health Authority had the highest rate at 55.6 cases per 100,000 followed by Interior Health Authority at 43.0 cases per 100,000 (see Figure 3 -3) (15). Vancouver Coastal Health Authority had the lowest rate at 34.2 cases per 100,000 (26). Figure 3 -3: Newly Diagnosed cases of Hepatitis C by Health Authority (2009 -2018) In BC, the prevalence of HCV infection is highest in people born between 1945 -1964 , whereas new infections occur more frequently in young er age cohorts , who are more likely to be affected by socioeconomic marginalization, mental health conditions and HIV and/or HBV infection (27). HCV is endemic among peo ple who inject drugs (PWID), the core group involved in the forward transmission of the present epidemic , accounting for up to 85% of new infections (27-29). Amongs t PWID in Canada, it has been estimated that 61.3% have HCV infection (22, 30) . Other population groups disproportionately affected by HCV in Canada, include immigrants from HCV endemic countries , individuals who have ever been incarcerated and Indigenous Peoples (31, 32) . Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 9 There is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection . Treatment based on interferon and ribavirin has been available in BC since 2000. Wh ile HCV cure is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, less than 15% of those with chronic HCV infection had been treated by 2012 (17) , in part due to poor tolerability and variable cure rates by genotype. In 2014, better -tolerated, short -course (8-12 weeks), interferon -free direct -acting antiviral s (DAA) with cure rates over 95% became available, dra matically improving the opportunity to prevent progressive l iver disease . 3.2.1 Coinfection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) appears to interfer e with HBV replication, as HBsAg clearance is 2.5 times higher among people with HBV/HCV infection , compared with HBV monoinfection, and HBV DNA levels are o ften low or undetectable in people with HBV/HCV coinfection (33, 34) . While 25% of individuals with HCV infection will spontaneous ly clear the HCV virus, 42% of those with HBV/HCV coinfection at baseline will clear the HCV infection (35, 36) . Moderate to severe reactivation of HBV infection has been reported when taking DAAs (34, 37 -39). 3.2.2 Coinfection with HIV HIV can have a significant impact on HCV infection. HCV/HIV coinfected individuals tend to have higher HCV viral loads, impacting HCV treatment response, and lower CD4+ counts. Coinfected individuals with a h igh degree of immunosuppression have a greater risk of liver fibrosis , and those with cirrhosis progress more quickly to HCC than HCV mono -infected individuals (19). Estimates of of HCV /HIV coinfection vary widely. HCV coinfection can occur in 2-4% of people living with HIV infection in the general population , and 50 -90% of HIV -positive PWID (22, Compared to HIV mono -infected individuals, HCV/HIV coinfected groups are characterized by a higher prevalence of injection drug use, poor social conditions , and mental illness . One study i n BC, found that of 3,219 HIV positive subjects, 53% were HCV/HIV coinfected. For those diagnosed with HCV first, the median time to HIV infection was 3.5 years , highlighting the importance of ongoing engagement, support and education (43). Figure 3 -4: Liver and drug -related mortality rates amongst people with HCV infection (30) Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 10 3.2.3 Harm Reduction Harm reduction refers to practices and programs that aim to reduce undue harms of substance use (44). Harm reductio n plays a critical role in the prevention of HCV transmission, initiation and completion of HCV treatment, and prevention of adverse health outcomes for people that use substances. In April 2016, the increase in accidental illicit drug overdose deaths prom pted the declaration of a public health emergency (45). From January 2016 to November 2020, 6,565 people in BC died due to an illicit drug overdose (46). This is largely attributed to the highly toxic synthetic opioid fentanyl in the illicit drug supply (47). Of the 1,300,204 individuals in BC who tested for HCV as of December 2018, 27.5% tested positive (30). Among people testing HCV positive, mortality related to acquisition risk factors (e.g., IDU) increased from 1992 to 2000, declined slowly until 2013, and then rapidly increased between 2014 to 2018 (see figure 3 -4). This recent increase coincides with the growing presence of fentanyl in the drug supply and recent surge in opioid overdose deaths (30). Conversely, liver -related deaths (e.g., HCC, alcoholic and non -alcoholic related liver disease) have declined from 2014 to 2018, likely as a result of the increased availability of direct acting antivirals for HCV treatment (see figure 3 -4). Liver -related mortality in individuals with HCV infection was more often seen in older people. Similarly , the Canadian Co -infection Cohort Study found that the majority of deaths seen in individuals with HCV/HIV coinfection were related to overdose, followed by factors related to ESLD and smoking (48). Harm Reduction Programs Harm reduction supply distribution programs are more effective than one -to-one exchange programs in preventing transmission of bloodborne pathogens (49). BCCDC Harm Reduction Services distributes safer sex and substance use supplies to nearly 400 sites across the province. The number of newly identified HCV and HIV infections among people who inject substances has decreased since 2002, coinciding with a concurrent increase in distribution of harm reduction supplies and scale up of other harm reduction services (50). Although ecological, this is further evidence that policies aimed at reducing harms from substance use have had a positive impact on population HCV and HIV rates. As of December 2020, there were almost 1,800 sites across BC distribut ing naloxone kits and more than 75,888 kits ha d been used to reverse an opioid overdose (51). Observed Consumption Services (OCS) include Supervised Consumption Sites, where people can use substances while being observed by staff trained in overdose response, and Overdose Prevention Services (OPS) , whe re people can connect with peer workers , community services and drug checking services . A Ministerial Order was issued in December 2016 for OPS to be opened where medically needed to prevent overdose dea ths (52). At OPS, s terile drug use supplies are provided , reducing the need to share , and thus reducing risk of HCV and HIV transmission. Many OCS also distribute s afer smoking supplies , to prevent transition to IDU and sharing of supplies. It also discoura ges the use of other materials that could potentially cause burns or injuries that could increase the risk of HCV transmission (53). In a survey with clients of harm reduction sites in 2018, 27% of people who used pipes to smoke substances reported using a second -hand pipe when they couldn't find unused smoking equipment, while 20% injec ted instead (54). Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) prescribers, available options and number of clients taking OAT have also significantly increased since 2016 . This is partly driven by guidelines , and recommendations for first -line treatment of buprenorphine/n aloxone for opioid use disorder (55, 56) . OAT has been shown to mitigate transmission of HIV and HCV infection (57-60), reduce illicit opioid use (61-64), and mortality rates (65-69), and increase engagement with health care and social services (70-72). Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 11 3.3 Disproportionately affected populations , testing indications and transmission (6, 31, 32, 73 -80) The decision to scre en or test for HCV infection depends on the likelihood of prior exposure . The risk for acquiring an HCV infection depends upon the nature of the activity and exposure, with parenteral and percutaneous routes being considered higher risk. Permucosal exposure is lower risk, with greater concern if the integrity of the mucosa in question has been compromised. Population groups experiencing disproportionately higher rates of HCV infection in BC include : People b orn between 1945 to 1965 , likely due to past acquisition risks (e.g., IDU, contaminated blood products or iatrogenic exposures) Persons who have ever been incarcerated , where lack of access to harm reduction supplies contributes to needle sharing by PWID and unsterile tattooing practices in correctional settings Born or lived in regions where HCV is endemic1. Select countries of origin of those diagnosed with HCV in BC: Region Countries of origin (81) In descending order of prevalence in BC within each region Central, East or South Asia China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Pakistan, India Eastern Europe Russia, Romania, Ukraine, Cyprus Sub-Saharan Africa Somalia North Africa or Middle East Iran, Turkey, Lebanon , Egypt Indigenous peoples, where health inequities contribute to national rates that are 4.7 times higher than non-indigenous populations (29) HCV testing can be considere d in certain clinical scenarios : First trimester of pregnancy if risk factors (e.g., PWID), repeat in third trimester if ongoing risk HIV or HBV infection Sexual and household contacts to HCV infection Findings suggestive of chronic liver disease: o Abnormal liver biochemistry (e.g., persistently elevated transaminases) o Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and jaun dice (late findings) o Thrombocytopenia Findings suggestive of acute liver disease Diagnosis of HCC or other liver diseases Ever received hemodialysis Children born to a parent with HCV infection Refer to Table 3 -1 for a summary of activities and associa ted level of transmission risk. 1 For estimates of HCV prevalence, see Mohd Hanafiah K, Groeger J, Flaxman AD, Wiersma ST. Global epidemiology of hepatitis C virus infection: new estimates of age -specific antibody to HCV seroprevalence. Hepatol ogy (Baltimore, Md). 2013;57(4):1333 -42. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 12 Table 3-1: Likelihood of transmission and activities associated with acquisition of HCV infection Likelihood Transmission Activity Comments Parenteral Injection drug use (IDU) Greatest risk in those who have ever shared drug preparation or injecting equipment In Canada and BC, ~ 85% new infections are related to IDU (27- 29) Potential iatrogenic exposures Receipt of healthcare in HCV is endemic areas where basic infection control practices were not followed and/or blood supply was not tested In Canada, increased risk if receipt of blood transfusion, blood products or organs before 1992 Tattooing, body piercing or acupuncture In unregulated premises where unsterile equipment and/or improper technique is used (82) Permucosal Non-injection drug use Risk when sharing drug use equipment, where the integrity of the mucosa is compromised or ulcerated (e.g. snorting can damage nasal mucosa, crack pipes can damage oral mucosa) Sexual Condomless sex, multiple partners Where blood is exchanged, as in sex causing mucosal tearing More frequently reported in gbMSM engaging i n group sex with concurrent substance use (i.e., \"party 'n play\" or \"chemsex\") Coinfection with HIV, HBV or other STI's that can cause sores or lesions can increase the risk Vertical Mother to baby 6% risk of transmission to infants born to HCV RNA positive mothers (73, 83 -86) Increased risk with higher RNA titres and in the presence of acute hepatitis symptoms 2-fold increased risk if mother has HIV/HCV coinfection (83) Sexual Condomless sex, with one long-term, partner Very low risk where blood is exchanged, as in sex causing mucosal tearing Horizontal Sharing personal hygiene items Household exposure Examples include sharing of nail clippers, razors and toothbrushes that may have traces of blood on them Occupational Accidental needle stick injury The average incidence of anti -HCV seroconversion after percutaneous exposure from a source with a history of HCV infection, in an occupational health setting is 2% Breastfeeding Theoretical risk to infant Advise to breastfeed, unless mother has HCV/HIV coinfection If nipples are cracked or bleeding, abstain from breastfeeding until healed There is no evidence that HCV is spread by coughing, sneezing, hugging, kissing, using the same dishes or cutlery, swimming in a chlorinated pool when a case has cuts or scrapes or when menstruating, being bitten or stung by an insect which then bites or stings someone else , or skin contact by others with the body flu ids of a case that are not exposed to blood (such as saliva, urine, feces or vomit). High Low Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 13 4.0 LABORATORY INFORMATION 4.1 HCV Testing Window Periods During the acute phase of HCV infection, AL T levels are markedly elevated, while they can fluctuate widely in chronic cases. Antibodies to HCV are usually detectable 5 to 10 weeks after infection and generally persist for life. The development of antibodies can be delayed or absent in immunocompromised individuals (e.g. HIV with CD4+<50 cells/mm3, chronic kidney disease, long -term immunosuppressant use, agammaglobulinemia). HCV RNA becomes detectable by NAT within 1 -3 weeks of infection. Figure 4 -1: Acute HCV Infection with Recovery 4.2 HCV Testing The BCCDC Public Health Laboratory (PHL) performs the majority (95%) of HCV antibody , and all HCV RNA and genotype testing in BC. A sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screen is used to detect antibodies to HCV. All samples testing reactive by this initial screen are retested using an EIA test from an alternative manufact urer. A quantitative test is used to detect HCV RNA, which has a lower limit of detection of approximately 12 IU/mL. All persons with an anti-HCV reactive result are considered infectious unless there is docu mented evidence of a resolved infection. While approximately 25% of HCV infected individuals are able to resolve their infection (usually within 6 months of infection) without treatment, most HCV infections become chro nic. To distinguish active from resolved infection, HCV RNA testing should be done after an initial anti -HCV reactive result. For requisitions and information about testing performed at the BCCDC PHL, refer to the BCCDC website . For information on sample collection and processing instructions, refer to the PHSA eLab Handbook . Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C Page 14 Table 4 -1: HCV tests. HCV test Description and Notes HCV antibody test (Anti-HCV) Window period: 5 -10 weeks Recommended first screening test for HCV infection Does not need to be repeated once positive, as antibodies usually persist for life Response may be blunted in immunocompromised person (e.g., HIV where CD4+ < 50). Even in a seronegative person, HCV infection could be present. Does not distinguish between past, current and resolved infection Antibodies are not protective. If an initial HCV infection is cleared sp ontaneously or due to treatment. A person can get infected with HCV again. HCV ribonucleic acid test (HCV RNA) Window period : 1-3 weeks Used to confirm active infection Does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection Recommended HCV screening test: o If prior anti -HCV positive and cleared HCV infection spontaneously or due to treatment o In an immunocompromised person o If the person is still within the window period for testing o Anti-HCV results are equivocal o When the re is high suspicion for HCV infection, but initial anti -HCV results are negative (e.g., compatible clinical presentation with no other clinical diagnosis identified and high pre -test probability) In BC, although the majority of HCV RNA positive results likely reflect chronic HCV infection, HCV RNA can be repeated 6 months after the initial test (or date of exposure if known) to rule out spontaneous clearance of infection There is no correlation between HCV RNA levels and severity of liver disease, or chance of successful completion of treatment (and achievement of SVR -12) HCV Genotype If the HCV RNA test is reactive, the blood specimen can be screened for genotypes 1 -6 The necessity of genotyping is becoming less important with the increased availability of pangenotypic DAA treatments. It can still be useful to help direct treatment decisions in certain scenarios. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 15 Figure 4 -2: HCV Testing Flowchart Automatic HCV RNA testing done as of January 13/20 on all first time anti-HCV reactive results, and previously anti -HCV reactive results where HCV RNA testing has never been done. Instructions will be provided on the BCCDC PHL lab result in situations wher e an additional EDTA tube is required for HCV RNA testing to be completed. * False negatives may occur in the presence of major immunosuppression (e.g., HIV infection where CD4+ < 50 cells/mm3 and agammaglobulinemia). Order HCV RNA where appropriate. Instructions will be provided on the BCCDC PHL lab result to collect an EDTA tube for HCV RNA testing to confirm an initial H CV RNA 'not detected' result. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 16 4.3 Reflex Testing The following section describes reflexive testing performed at the B CCDC PHL. It is important to check for past test resul ts in the client's file and local electronic laboratory system s (e.g., CareConnect , Excelleris) in order to ensure that the correct tests are ordered and tubes of blood are collected , and to avoid unnec essary accessioning and testing of specimens . If you are unsure of the individual's prior HCV testing history, contact the BCCDC PHL Lab Client Services (1-877-747-2522). On the first reactive anti-HCV result, the following reflexive testing is done at the BCCDC PHL : 1. HCV RNA testing (87) As of January 13, 2020, serologic HCV RNA testing is reflexively done on all : First time anti-HCV reactive results Previously reactive anti -HCV results , where HCV RNA testing has never been done The HCV RNA will not be reflexed if a sample tests positive for HCV antibodies and there is already a prior HCV RNA result in the system . Be sure to ch eck for past HCV test results so that the correct test is ordered. Sometimes an EDTA tube of blood is still required to confirm an initial reflexed HCV RNA result. Where indicated, these follow -up recommendations are noted on the patient's lab report. This can occur when the reflexive HCV RNA test result is equivoc al or not detected, or if the strength of the initial anti -HCV signal is too low. 2. Hepatitis A and B immune status testing Reflexive testing for total antibody to hepatitis A (anti -HAV total) and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is performed on al l first time reactive anti -HCV results. Where anti -HBs is non -reactive, further testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and total hepatitis B core antibody (anti -HBc Total) is automatically done. Recommendations can then be made regarding recommend ed immunizations and case management (e.g., referral to a specialist if HBV infection) , based upon these results. If HAV and HBV results are not a vailable on an anti-HCV reactive laboratory report, check local electronic lab results systems. If you cannot locate them , call the BCCDC PHL Lab Client Services (1-877-747-2522) . If they are not available, HAV and HBV immune status testing can be added on if requested within 7 days of the laboratory receiving the HCV sample. 3. HCV genotype testing HCV genotype testing can only be performed on specimens co llected in EDTA tubes that test HCV RNA positive. Call BCCDC Lab Client Services (1-877-747-2522) if needing to add this test on to a specimen that has tested HCV RNA positive on an EDTA tube. It can be done refle xively, if requested at the same time as HCV RNA testing ordered on an EDTA tube. HCV genotype testing has not yet been validated on specimens collected in SST tubes. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 17 4.4 Interpretation of Test Results See Appendix A for examples of results as reported out by the BCCDC PHL. Contact the BCCDC PHL if unsure of how to interpret HCV test results. 4.4.1 HCV Antibody Test Results Two sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) platforms are used to detect antibodies to HCV. The incidence of false pos itive EIA results is extremely low (0.2 - 0.4%). Table 4-2. Interpretation of HCV antibody test results HCV Anti body test result Screening HCV antibody assay Supplemental HCV antibody assay Interpretation Anti-HCV reactive EIA test is reactive EIA test is reactive Person has antibodies to HCV and therefore has been infected with the hepatitis C virus at some point in their life Reactive result does not indicate active infection or immunity Anti-HCV non-reactive EIA test is non-reactive N/A HCV infection is ruled out in most immu nocompetent persons. No further testing is required. If the test was performed before this marker became detectable and the person has high risk behaviours, consider repeat ing anti-HCV 1 -2 months. If immunocompromised , anti -HCV response may be blunted and confirmatory HCV RNA testing may still be required Anti-HCV equivocal EIA test is reactive EIA test is non-reactive If clinically indicated, a HCV RNA test is required to determine if active infection exists Equivocal results usually indicate a false positive 4.4.2 HCV RNA Test Results Table 4-3. Interpretation of HCV RNA test results HCV RNA Test Result Interpretation HCV RNA detected Indicates active infection with HCV (i.e. the virus is actively replicating) Does not distinguish between acute or chronic infection No HCV RNA detected No evidence of active infection The infection has resolved either spontaneously or as a result of therapy Re-infection can occur if the client has on -going risk factors The HCV RNA test is quantitatively accurate between 1 2 and 100 ,000,000 IU/mL. Note that t he viral load may be reported outside of this range at < 12 IU/mL, but an active infection can still be detected and reported as \"HCV RNA detected \". Practitioner Alert! Anti-HCV antibodies usually persist for life and do not need to be repeated once result is reactive. A reactive result does not differentiate between a resolved case and an active infection. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 18 5.0 PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT The following case definitions described in this section are specific to Public Health documentation and attribution of HCV cases in BC. Definitions used in daily clinical practice may employ the same terminology, but can differ significantly in their use and meaning. Laboratory results available to public health may not be adequate to meet clinical requirements for staging the infection, but will generally be sufficient for surveillance purposes of documenting and attributing cases appropriately. The information presen ted in this section may be used to guide the documentation and geographical attribution of confirmed (not suspect, or Person Under investigation, or PUI ) HCV cases using an electronic public h ealth information system. One key distinction in how HCV case definitions are used by public health reporting is the focus on seroconversion . In BC, individuals who have a 'anti-HCV not detected' to 'anti- HCV detected' within 12 -month time period ) are considered an 'acute' case , regardless of whether HCV RNA results are available or not, and regardless of clinical presentation . HCV cases attributed to BC that have not been reported els ewhere in Canada are reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The acute stage of HCV infection is important to capture , as these cases represent an important population whose risks re flect current transmission and acquisition risk factors. This provides key opportunit ies to engage individuals with HCV infection into comprehensive care. The documentation and attribution of 'acute' HCV cases can support case management by gathering acquisition risk factors. From this information, the linkage to care can be facilitated by the provision of timely education and service referrals (see Section 6.0 ). The documentation of other stages like 'resolved' is useful to have, but is not crucial (see Table 5 -1 for Panorama staging ). For individuals with newly identified HCV infections in BC who list their permanent r esidence as out of province, f ollow RHA guidelines, and refer to recommendations in the Surveillance of Reportable Conditions, Chapter 6 of the BCCDC CDC Manual . 5.1 Case Definitions As there is no single serological test available for identification of newly -acquired infection s, seroconversion and time parameters are used as a proxy. Local surveillance systems may be limited by the current reporting of laboratory testing results . For confirmed case definitions, see ' Case ' in Section 2.0 Definitions . For Panorama specific staging guidance, see table 5 -1. Refer to RHA guidelines for further specific classification requirements related to a particular public health information syste m. The flow of i ndividual lab reports can vary, but in general anti-HCV test results are received first, followed by HCV RNA , and then genotyping. A confirmed HCV case may consist of a single 'anti -HCV detected' test result, with or witho ut other results. An antibody positive client who then receives HCV RNA results ('HCV RNA detected' or 'No HCV RNA detected') remains a confirmed case. If the only information available is a stand -alone 'HCV RNA detected' test result or genotype result (without an anti-HCV result), these are also considered confirmed cases. Practitioner Alert! Case definitions used for the purposes of surveillance in BC differ from their use in a clinical setting. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 19 Table 5-1: Confirmed case definitions of Hepatitis C for the purposes of Public Health reporting in Panorama Staging Age Baseline anti -HCV test result Present HCV test result Acute Adults, adolescents & children > 18 months Anti-HCV negative result on record within the prior 12 months Anti-HCV positive OR HCV RNA positive Chronic ^ Adults, adolescents & children > 18 months Anti-HCV negative result on record > 12 months ago OR No documentation available of previous anti -HCV result HCV RNA positive Resolved ^, Adults, adolescents & children > 18 months Anti-HCV positive HCV RNA negative Unstaged * Adults, adolescents & children > 18 months Anti-HCV negative result on record > 12 months ago OR No documentation of previous anti-HCV result Anti-HCV positive AND No HCV RNA result available Unstaged ** Children 18 months N/A HCV RNA positive 4 to 6 weeks of age OR Anti-HCV positive at 18 months of age ^ If an anti -HCV reactive and a HCV RNA positive result are received at the same time, report as an 'acute' case first, and then change to 'chronic' or 'resolved' using the same date. For the purposes of surveillance, for all cases > 18 months only a single negative HCV RNA is required to confirm resolution (no time parameter) * Update case within the same investigation when HCV RNA result arrives ** In the case of children 18 months, leave unstaged until further testing has been completed. This can be revised to chronic or resolved if further HCV RNA results are available after 18 months. 5.2 New case follow -up This section describes suggested follow -up of new HCV cases , carried out by public health personnel with the assistance of a primary health care provider where possible. Refer to local guidelines for further guidance. Case Identification Lab notification received confirming HCV infection (usually anti-HCV results , may also see reflexed HCV RNA results) Document test result s in your health authority's public health information system Review prior testing history to determine if new HCV case Classify according to age and prior baseline anti -HCV test result (see Table 5 -1 for staging information specific to Panorama ) Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 20 Reporting Use your health authority's public health information system to report confirmed cases of HCV If reporting a new acute HCV, c omplete the Hepatitis C Acute Case Report Form Case Management Engage into care. If appropriate offer referrals and resources for : o Primary care provider (MD/NP) for further clinical evaluation o If no reflexed result available, recommend HCV RNA testing to confirm current infection . Ensure that the primary ca re provider has been copied on the result. o Immunization update . Check for HAV/HBV testing results and prior immunizations . o Alcohol and drug harm reduction care (e.g., OAT referral) o Mental health and addictions counselling o STI screening o General health and education resources (e.g. . diet, housing resources) o Community support groups and services Review transmission information and prevention , providing supports where needed (e.g., local harm reduction sites for safer sex and drug use supplies, supervised consumptions services and overdose prevention sites) Discuss potential for stigma and that disclosure is voluntary Where possible, offer to assist client with notifying contacts and provide local testing resources 6.0 ACUTE CASE MAN AGEMENT The following section outlines suggested follow -up for cases of acute HCV. Many of the recommendations below are not exclusive to acute cases and may also apply to cases of chronic HCV. Individuals may avoid seeking follow -up care due to stigma a nd discrimination , which can be even more pronounced in rural and remote areas. The creat ion of a supportive environment that respects the privacy and culture of each individual will help to foster the trust needed to develop a partnership of care. T he challenges that face individuals in the context of the broader determinants of health (e.g. housing, coping skills, gender) must be acknowledged when reviewing a new HCV lab test result or diagnosis. 6.1 Management of Adults The British Columbia Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC -HTC) is a cohort containing de-identified health information for 1.7 million individuals (as of 2018) who were tested for HCV or HIV, or diagnosed with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV or active tuberculosis from 1990 to 2015 . These data are linked with multiple datasets on medical visits, hospitalizations, cancers, prescription drugs, and death records (88, 89) . The BC-HTC database reveals how many people living with HCV infection are getting the care that they need. From the care cascade (see Figure 6-1), it is clear that there are a significant number of people with HCV infection who are being lost to follow -up after initial testing . Where possible, efforts should be made to engage people living with HCV infection into comprehensive care upon initial contact. 6.1.1 First Contact Check for HCV RNA results to confirm active infection. I f direct contact with a client is part of a RHA 's routine practice, attempt to confirm that the client is aware of their diagnosis with the primary care provider before initiating contact . In situations where confirmation with the primary care provider cannot be established , direct contact with a client may be appropriate . Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 21 If HCV RNA results have not be en reflexively performed by the BCCDC PHL, recommend confirmation of infection by HCV RNA testing (collected in an EDTA tube). . Ensure that the primary care provider (PCP) is copied on the results, and advise client to follow -up with their PCP for results. Hav ing this result at the follow - up visit with their PCP can help with continuity of care. It is within the scope of practice of a STI certified RN to order a HCV RNA test (see STI assess ment DST ). Figure 6 -1: HCV Cascade of Care . Data from the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC -HTC). 6.1.2 Contact Tracing and Disclosure It is recommended that the interview for contact information be done by the first health care professional (e.g. public health personnel, primary care provider) who interviews the client, as there may not be another opportunity to do so. Give a rationale as to why the case report information is being collected to provide reassurance regarding privacy and confid entiality. Where possible, provide assistance to clients with notifying contacts who may need testing and counselling. Provide resources and education regarding options for local HCV testing and prevention of transmission. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 22 6.1.3 Health Teaching to Prevent HCV Transmission It is essential to assess for acquisition risk factors. Even after clearing an initial infection spontaneously, or after successful hepatitis C treatment, individuals remain at risk for premature death re lated to acquisition risk factors (30) Advise how to prevent transmission: Do not share equipment used for injection, snorting or smoking of drugs ( e.g., needles, syringes, straws , cookers, water source, mixes/washes and pipes ) Do not share equip ment used for tattooing , body piercing or other acupuncture (e.g., needles, ink ) Do not share personal care items (e.g., toothbrushes, razors, earrings or manicure equipment ) Do not donate blood, semen, brea st milk, body organs or tissues Keep all open cuts and sores covered until healed Put articles with blood on them (e.g. tampons , bandages) in a separate plastic bag before dispos al in household garbage Dispo se of bloody sharp items (e.g. razor blades, needles) into a hard -sided container, taped shut Wearing clean, disposable gloves, c lean blood spills by using absorbent materials first (e.g., paper towels ). Then clean the area more thoroughly with soap and water, and then disinfect . To disinfect , use a fresh solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water . Allow to sit for 10 minutes before wiping off. If considering pregnancy discuss the risk of transmission to the infant . Breastfeeding is generally considered safe (see Section 6.1.6 ). For additional information on reducing the risk of transmission from bloo d and body fluids, refer to o HealthLink BC File #97, Contact with Blood or Body Fluids: Protecting Against Infecti on 6.1.4 General Health and referrals Assist in obtaining a referral to a primary care provider (PCP) if needed . The PCP can conduct further assessments and tests prior to consulting with and/or referring to healthcare provider experienced with HCV management and treatment (e.g., gastroenterologist, hepatologist , infectious disease specialist or MD/NP with HCV experience ) for more specialized care and treatment consideration if needed . See Figure 4 -1 for the HCV testi ng flow chart. If appropriate, assess for other STI's and offer harm reduction education and counseling. Provide referrals to STI clinics and harm reduction services aimed at reducing the risk of acquiring HIV infection and reducing harms a ssociated with illicit drug use (e.g., drug use supply, distribution and recovery sites, supervised injection facilities, opioid substitution therapies). Liver fibrosis can progress in the presence of coinfection with HBV or HIV, alcohol con sumption (> 2-3 drinks/day) , non -alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity and insulin resistance. Discuss limiting or avoiding alcohol, avoiding hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. acetaminophen) and eating a well -balanced diet, as part of a healthy lifestyle and to min imize liver damage. Clients should consult with their primary care provider before using over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies2. 2 Herbal remedies include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations, and finished herbal products that contain parts of plants or other plant materials as active ingredients ( 55). Clients may refer to them as, but are not limited to, the following examples: \"natural\", \"alternative\", \"traditional\" or \"Chinese\" medicine. Communicable C April 2021 Page 23 6.1.5 Immunizations All persons with an anti -HCV reactive result are considered to be at higher risk for certain infections. Regardless of HCV RNA results, the following immunizations are provincially covered for anyone testing anti-HCV reactive: hepatitis A vaccine series , if susceptible hepatitis B vaccine series , if susceptible pneumococcal vaccine annual influenza vaccine Review reflexive testing results for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, that are automatically done by the BCCDC PHL on all new anti -HCV reactive test resu lts (see Section 4.2 ), and prior immunization history . Timely HBV immunization is important for those living with chronic HCV infection , as a better immune response to HBV vaccine is observed if immunization occurs before th e onset of cirrhosis (54). Engaging individuals into care also provides an opportunity to assess for other outstanding routine immunizations. For more information on routine immunizations for the general adult populatio n and those recommended for persons with chronic liver disease , refer to the BC Immunization Manual . 6.1.6 Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Recommend pregnant women who are anti-HCV positive to have confirmatory HCV RNA testing done . If active infection is confirmed, recommend liver fun ction testing to identify those with compromised liver functioning who may require specialist referral. Recommend breastfeeding to mothers who are infected with HCV. If the nipples become cracked or bleed, mothers can abstain from breastfeeding until the y are healed. To prevent cessation of milk supply, mothers may consider expressing and discarding breast milk until their nipples are healed. Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers co -infected with HIV. 6.1.7 Private Insurance Testing Clients identified through insurance applications may go through a different process when report ing to Public Health. The elements of follow up are the same as for other all other newly identified cases. These c lients may be contacted directly by public health personnel to begin follow -up and/or a primary care provider , who may complete the follow -up process. Information regarding the appropriate vaccinations, testing and counselling for a case can be provided to the primary care provider. 6.1.8 Transfusion Transmission If risk factors indicate the possibility of a tran sfusion transmissible infection, where the clien t has been a donor or recipient, follow the reporting process in the BCCDC CD Manual, Chapter 1: Transfusion Transmissible Infections . Practitioner Alert! Individuals who spontaneous ly clear a HCV infection (i.e. resolved infection ) should be offered the se immunizations for free, as they are still considered to be at higher risk for certain infections. Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 24 6.2 Management of Neonate to Determine Vertical Transmission Maternal antibodies can cross the placenta , yielding a false positive result up until the infant is 18 months of age (90, 91) . In 95% of cases , maternal antibody will no longer be detectable in the infant by 12 months of age. In the remaining 5%, m aternal antibody will no longer be detectable by 15 to 18 months of age (91). The BCCDC PHL will not normally process requests for antibody testing on infants less than 18 months . Public Health r ecommendations for infants born to mothers wit h HCV infection * Anti-HCV testing at 18 months Infants testing anti-HCV reactive at 18 months should: o Be referred to a paediatric infectious disease specialist or hepatologist for further testing and care . o Receive vaccines as per routine infant and chronic liver disease schedules (see BC Immunization Manual, Part 1: Immunization Schedu les and Part 2: Immunization of Special Populations ). For m others who have cleared an initial HCV infection sponta neously or after HCV treatment, the chance of transmitt ing HCV infection to their infant is virtually zero. It is unclear if there is a maternal HCV RNA threshold above which transmission is more likely (92). Follow -up for HCV testing at 18 months can be very poor. A flag or reminder on the mother and infant's file can help to ensure that anti -HCV testing and routine vaccinations are completed when the infant is 18 months of age . Coordinated efforts amongst prima ry care providers, specialists and public health, can help to ensure that appropriate testing and follow -up of infants is completed (93-96). To allay parental anxiety, earlier t esting for HCV RNA can be considered when infants are 2 months (73, 92, 97). Consult with or refer to a specialist as needed . Note that i f the infant tests : HCV RNA negative, absen ce of infection should be confirmed with repeat HCV RNA 6 months later and a nti-HCV testing at 18 months (97) HCV RNA positive, presence of infection must be confirm ed with repeat HCV RNA after 12 months of age and a nti-HCV testing at 18 months of age (98) o An earlier diagnosis before 18 months does not change follow -up recommendations, as there are no treatments or interventions currently approved until children turn 3 years of age (92) o Infants who develop chronic HCV infection generally experience mild clinical sequelae o 25-40% of neonatal HCV infection spontaneously clear by 2 years (up to 7 years of age) (98) For a sample letter that public health can send to a MD/NP advising of recommended testing for an infant born to a mother with HCV infection , refer to Appendix B. Recommendations for people child potential infection: Ribavirin -containing treatme nt regimens are teratogenic. There have not been enough studies to confirm the safety of DAAs during pregnancy or while chest -/breast -feeding. HCV treatment should be completed before pregnancy or after completion of breast feeding. Individuals who are cured before becoming pregnant cannot pass HCV infection to their infant. See Section 6.3 Treatment and Appendix D for further information on treatment. * Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 25 6.3 Treatment Depending on the genotype , prior treatment with ribavirin and injectable pegylated interferon typically lasted 24 to 48 week s. Cure rates ranged from 40 to 80% , and people often experienced severe side effects (99). The introduction of direct -acting antiviral agents (DAA's) has dramatically changed the HCV treatment landscape . Newer regimens (6): Consistently have cure rates greater than 95% Are pangenotypic Are all oral and interferon free Typically last 8-12 weeks Have few side effects By treating HCV infection early, liver-related morbidity ( i.e., liver damage, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma) and mortality can be reduced and forward transmission of infection halted. In BC, fibrosis restrictions for the coverage of treatment were lifted in March 2018 (100) . Regardless of fibrosis stage, anyone with BC Pharmacare coverage can have their HCV infection t reated. The type and duration of hepatitis C treatment is determined on an individual basis. Treatment type and duration varies depending on multiple factors such as prior treatment history, co -morbidities, and presence of cirrhosis . Treatment work -up can be done by the primary care provider who has experience in HCV care , referring t o a specialist as needed . See Appendix D : Quick Reference Treatment Guide for Health Care Providers for suggested treatment work -up and follow -up care. A sustained virologic response is defined as having no detectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR -12). This is synonymous with a virological cure, but patients can still be re -infected if they have on -going risk exposures.

These are not meant to be prescriptive, as there may be other considerations unique to each individual situation, in addition to local health authority and site specific processes and guidelines. Case studies #1 t o #5 have a more narrow focus on HCV, while case study #6 is compr ised of four parts that include comprehensive care considerations. Note: Non-reactive = Negative Reactive = Positive Case study #1 HCV RNA reflex testing, Low but detectable HCV RNA levels Clinical History and Lab Results Zane tested for HCV for the first time last week. He has come in to review the between current or resolved HCV infection. Please inform your medical health officer if this infection might be due to a recent blood product transfusion. HCV RNA detected (active infection) Specimen Description Plasma Test Name Results HCV RNA < 12 HCV RNA(log 10IU/mL) Not calculated HCV RNA detected How would you interpret these results? Explanation The B CCDC PHL has performed both anti-HCV and HCV RNA testing on the initial serology specimen . HCV RNA reflexive testing on first -time positive anti -HCV results came into effect on January 13, 2020. The presence of HCV RNA indicates an active infection. Although below the lower limit of detection of 12 IU/mL, HCV RNA was detected some where betwe en zero and 12 IU/mL, and reported as an active infection. General follow -up considerations The anti -HCV reactive result indicates that Zane has had a HCV infection at some point The HCV RNA detected result indicates that Zane currently has an active infection. Refer to a MD/NP with HCV experience or to a specialist for further assessment and follow -up testing. Approximately 25% of initial infections spontaneously clear, which generally occurs within 6 months. Re-testing for HCV RNA 6 mo nths after the date of exposure (or if unsure, date of testing if ongoing risks) will clarify current HCV status. Review transmission prevention information Public Health reporting considerations Following regional guidelines, enter as a confirmed chronic case of hepatitis C. Enter as \"unstaged\" in the public health electronic document ation system where appropriate , as there is no prior HCV testing history.

The HCV test is as follows: Anti-HCV: EQUIVOCAL If clinically indicated, please submit an EDTA blood for HCV RNA testing to confirm active infection How would you interpret this result and what would your next steps be? Explanation There was disagreement between the screening and supplemental anti -HCV tests. Usually this reflects a false positive result. If clinically indicated (e.g., immunocompromised, recent or ongoing higher risk exposures), consider testing for HCV RNA. General follow -up considerations Ask Lloyd about any recent possible exposures. In meeting eligibility criteria for HIV PrEP, there may be ongoing risks for HCV exposure. Confirmation of HCV status with EDTA blood collection for HCV RNA testing should be considered.

Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 35 Explanation Reflex HCV RNA testing on first time anti -HCV positives started January 13, 2020; however, when the signals from the screening or supplemental testing platforms are low, HCV RNA reflex testing cannot be done on serology samples (SST tubes) and an EDTA tube is required. The BCCDC PHL will note on the laboratory report when an EDTA tube is required for HCV RNA testing to be done. General follow -up considerations Cole has been exposed to HCV at some point since last testing less than 1 year ago. Another blood draw for an EDTA tube to test for HCV RNA to see if an active infection is present. Review transmission prevention information Complete as much of the case report form as possible , as there may not be another chance to do so Review acquisition risk factors and provide referrals and resources as appropriate Public Health reporting considerations Report as an acute case of HCV infection , as there is documentation of an anti-HCV nonreactive result from less than 1 year ago. Follow local health authority documentation guidelines and processes References BCCDC Hepatitis C Guidelines: o Section 4.4 Interpretation of Test Results o Section 5.0 Public Health Management o Section 6.0 Acute Case Management o Appendix A: Examples of Laboratory Results BCCDC Public Health Laboratory Update: Hepatitis C reflex testing Case study #4 Sexual transmission, regular partner Clinical History and Lab Results Skylor is wondering if there is any risk for getting HCV infection if condoms are no longer used with a long- term partner, who is living with chronic HCV infection. What would you tell Skylor? Explanation It is relatively rare to see sexual transmission of HCV between long-term couples Compared with parenteral exposure, sexual transmission is not a very eff icient means of acquiring an HCV infection, but it has been more recently reported in the context of gbMSM engaging in ChemSex/Party 'n Play and gbMSM who have HIV infection. Sexual activities that may lead to potential blood exposure include those that ca n cause mucosal tearing, such as condomless receptive anal sex. General follow -up considerations Skylor's partner should be encouraged to complete HCV treatment In making a decision, Skylor and her partner should keep in mind that consistent condom use is also recommended for STI prevention and as an option for birth control (if appropriate) Although sexual transmission is not commonly seen, recommend HCV screening at least annually Recommend routine STI screening Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 36 References BCCDC Hepatitis C Guideline s: o Section 3.3 Disproportionately affected populations, testing indications and transmission Case study #5 Ongoing risk exposure, HCV testing Clinical History and Lab Results Jay and Nya have come to inquire about HCV testing for Nya. Jay has chronic HCV infection, but does not have a regular healthcare provider. They are not sure if they got their syringes mixed up a couple of days ago. Jay often has to help Nya inject, as it is difficult to find a suitable vein. Nya cannot re call getting tested for HCV before. How would you proceed? Explanation Sharing of drug -use equipment is an efficient means of acqui ring an HCV infection General follow -up considerations Recommend anti -HCV testing for Nya today Recommend HCV treatment for Jay o Offer to start pre -treatment work -up where possible o Refer Jay to a primary care physician or NP, preferably someone with HCV experience Recommend routine STI testing for Nya and Jay, including HCV for Nya until Jay has cleared the virus Review tra nsmission prevention information Inquire about any other priorities that they may need help with (e.g., housing, food security) Address acquisition risk factors: o Review safer injecting tips o Refer to the Toward the Heart website . The 'Find a Site' feature can help to locate distribution sites in BC where safer sex and drug use supplies , and nalox one kits are available. o Offer training on how to respond to an overdose, including Naloxone training o Offer referrals for opioid agonist therapy (OAT) if appropriate References and Resources BCCDC Hepatitis C Guidelines: o Section 3.3 Disproportionately affected populations, testing indications and transmission o Section 4.2 HCV Testing o Sectio n 6.3 Treatment o Appendix E: Quick Reference HCV Treatment Guide for Healthcare Providers Toward the Heart o Overdose prevention training and resources o Find a site BC Centre for Substance Use o Healthcare Provider Resources > OAT Clini cs Accepting New Patients o People Who Use Drugs Resources Pathways Medical Care Directory: Search for Care Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 37 Case study #6 - part 1 of 4 Prior anti -HCV reactive Clinical History and Lab Results Kai presents for routine STI testing. Upon taking a medical history, you check the file and local laboratory between current or resolved HCV infection. If clinically indicated please submit an EDTA blood for HCV RNA to confirm an active infection. Please inform your medical health officer if this infection might b e due to a recent blood product transfusion. Kai tells you that he hasn't seen a healthcare provider since getting the anti -HCV results because \"the visit didn't go very well\". The Case Report Form (CRF) and contact follow -up remain outstanding. Complete hepatitis A and B v accine series are noted on file, including anti -HBs 10 mIU/mL. What are your next steps? Explanation The BCCDC PHL began HCV RNA reflexive testing on first -time positive anti -HCV results beginning on January 13, 2020. Before that, people had to be recalled to see their healthcare provider to obtain an additional lab requisition to have another bl ood draw for HCV RNA testing on an EDTA tube of blood. General follow -up considerations Provide an oppor tunity to further discuss concerns about the last clinic visit and to help determine how to create a safer space for Kai to receive care Recommend testing for HCV RNA to see if a n active HCV infection is present Review transmission prevention Explore acquisition risk factors and offer appropriate supports and referrals Review pre-test counseling information , including HCV transmission and reportability Try to complete as much of the CRF as you can , taking care not to overwhelm Kai. Ask if it is OK to be in contact with any further questions later if needed . Discuss which mode of patient education would work best for Kai (e.g., in person follow -up, mobile texting supports, online resources) Public Health reporting considerations Following regional guidelines, enter as a confirmed chronic case of hepatitis C. Enter as \"unstaged\" in the public health electronic documentation system where appropriate, as there is no prior HCV testing history. References BCCDC Hepatitis C Guidelines: o Section 4.4 Interpretation of Test Results o Section 5.0 Public Health Management o Section 6.0 Acute Case Management o Appendix A: Examples of Laboratory Results Hepatitis Education Canada Resources : Pre- and Post -Test Checklists Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 38 Case study #6 - part 2 of 4 Spontaneous Clearance Clinical History and Lab Results Kai returns for the HCV RNA results, and they are as follows: December 2020: No HCV RNA detected (no active infection) Specimen Description Plasma Test Name Results HCV RNA 0.011566657 HCV RNA (log 10IU/mL) Not calculated No HCV RNA detected All other STI results were negative. At the last visit you were able to complete the CRF, and Kai had mentioned that there is sometimes sharing of crack pipes with partners and condomless anal sex. Kai had also injected \"down\" a few times, but felt it was \"nothing serious\" and declined any referrals at the time. You review the results with Kai. What are some things that you would try to talk with Kai about today? Explanation It looks like Kai has spontaneously cleared the HCV infection and cannot pass an HCV infection on to others. This can happen in approximately 25% of initial infections General follow -up considerations Review post-testing counseling information , noting that reinfection can still occur even after an infection has cleared, whether spontaneously or due to successful treatment Revisit acquisition risk f actors and concerns about potential for exposure through IDU, sharing of crack pipes and drug prep materials , and condomless anal sex: o Refer Kai to the Toward the Heart website. The ' Find a Site' feature can help to locate distribution sites in BC where safer sex and drug use supplies are available. o Review eligibility for HIV PrEP indications Inquire about any other priorities that Kai needs help with (e.g., housing, food security) Talk to Kai about STBBI risks associated with increased IDU , especially in light of the provincial emergency overdose response. Provide or o ffer resources for Naloxone training Public Health reporting considerations Following regional guidelines, update staging to \"resolved\" HCV infection in the public health electronic documentation system where appropriate .

Kai has returned, after being notified by a Public Health Nurse about being a contact to someone who tested positive for HIV and HCV infection. Kai is clearly anxious , teary and upset ; but after some discussion, you determine that it is safe to proceed with testing. Which HCV test(s) would you order ? What are some referrals that you c ould offer? Explanation Once someone has tested anti -HCV reactive, it will generally remain reactive for life. HCV RNA should be ordered for any future HCV testing. General follow -up considerations Recommend STI testing, including HCV RNA Inquire about recent exposures, offering HIV PEP and CT/GC coverage if appropriate Refer to sexual assault services and recommended care if appropriate Follow local health authority guidelines regarding follow -up of co ntacts to HIV and HCV infection. Revisit Kai's desire to proceed with supports and referrals regarding increasing drug use, and other priorities for Kai (e.g., housing, food security) Provide counseling support options if appropriate (e.g., follow -up visi t, referral, text/phone/online counseling support) References and Resources BCCDC Hepatitis C Guidelines: o Section 4.2 HCV Testing Toward the Heart o Overdose prevention training and resources o Find a site BC Centre for Substance Use o Healthcare Provider Resources > OAT Clinics Accepting New Patients o People Who Use Drugs Resources SmartSex Resource: Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) BC HIV Pre -Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) BCCDC Non Certified Practice Decision Support Tool for Prophylaxis Post Sexual Assault BCCDC Blood and Body Fluid Exposure Management Guideline Case study #6 - part 4 of 4 HCV RNA detected Clinical History and Lab Results Several months have passed since the last visit, but Kai has just shown up to be seen at clinic today. The HCV test result is as follows: HCV RNA detected (active infection) Specimen Description Plasma Test Name Results HCV RNA 215532 HCV RNA(log 10IU/mL) 5.30HCV RNA detected Communicable Disease Control Hepatitis C April 2021 Page 40 The rest of the STI & HIV tests from March 2021 have returned negative. Kai appears fatigued and is pacing back and forth as you enter the room. Heroin use has increased to daily injections, in addition to smoking crack six or more times a day with a group of friends. Kai started to try to use safe consumption sites for injecting, but sometimes can't wait to get in there. Kai is quite scared after waking up in hospital la st week, being told that emergency ambulance attendants had to use 3 ampoules of Narcan before Kai started to breathe again. An initial prescription for HIV PrEP was filled, but Kai had difficulties remembering to take it, so just stopped. How would you pr oceed? Explanation The presence of HCV RNA indicates an active infection. Individuals with new active HCV infection should be referred to a GP /NP with HCV experience or a specialist to discuss possible HCV treatment for acute infection. There is still a chance that the infection will spontaneously clear again within 6 months. Note: In this particular scenario, Kai cleared an initial infection spontaneously. However, if an initial infection is cleared after achieving SVR12 , it can be difficult to determine if a subsequent HCV infection is a reinfection or relapse after treatment . Review of prior laboratory tes ting and clinical history , and c onsultation with the BCCDC PHL, Medical Microbiologist and Surveillance teams , can help to determine case classification in such situations. General follow -up considerations Review the result with Kai: there is an active infection now that can be passed to others. Review transmission informatio n, including concerns about ongoing risk for transmission, emphasizing that this is more likely when engaging in IDU, sharing of crack pipes and condomless anal sex Provide a referral for HCV treatment: o Discuss the availabilit y of highly effective, short duration HCV treatment o Do as much of the pre -treatment work -up where possible, as timely follow -up may not be assured Given prior challenges taking HIV PrEP without support, try to anticipate potential need for adherence suppor t before challenges arise. o Explore local outreach and pharmacy services to see if additional supports can be put in place if Kai starts HCV treatment and HIV PrEP. Inquire about other priorities for Kai (e.g., housing, food security), offering referrals f or Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT) , Safe Supply sites and counselling as appropriate. Work with Kai to see which method of partner notification works best. Public Health reporting considerations Following regional guidelines, update the public health electronic documentation system to 'reinfection' where appropriate. Consult with the BCCDC Surveillance team if unsure of how to proceed.
