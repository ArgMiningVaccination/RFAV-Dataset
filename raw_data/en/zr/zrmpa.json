[View All Plans](/patients/accepted-insurance) [Biography](#biography-content) About Naoki Umeda, MD Naoki Umeda, MD is an Integrative Medicine specialist with an interest in cancer, nutrition/food therapy, and therapeutic touch. He is originally from Japan, where the average life expectancy is the longest in the world. He has more than 6 years of experience providing Integrative Medicine for cancer patients (Integrative Oncology). After receiving his medical degree from a national medical school in Tokyo, Japan, Dr. Umeda trained as an Internal Medicine resident and Gastroenterology fellow in Tokyo. He then completed an advanced fellowship of Hepatology (liver disease) and a fellowship of Gastroenterology Oncology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Based on his experience of treating patients in \"clinically tough situations\" such as liver transplant recipients and advanced stage cancer patients, Dr. Umeda became more interested in \"whole person\" and \"Body/Mind/Spirit\" care. He then worked as an Integrative Medicine staff physician and combined Western Medicine with Eastern/Traditional Medicine such as acupuncture, Chinese herbal therapy, and Ayurveda. He realized this blend would produce a beautiful \"synergy effect\" to relieve both physical and spiritual pain, and to improve quality of life for cancer patients. Dr. Umeda provides one-hour Integrative Medicine consultations to create personalized treatment plans for patients at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
