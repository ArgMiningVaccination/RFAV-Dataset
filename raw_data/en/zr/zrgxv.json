It's filled with volatile oils, making extremely medicinal in addition to its culinary value. It's a gorgeous hedge looking herb in the summer and just rubbing the leaves through my hands calms me. Sage is a plant that is wise and powerful. I use it during the fall winter for sore throats as a gargle, spray or tea, for excess sweating including menopause, oral health as a tooth powder and for digestion as a tea. Also I love using garden sage for smudging. Although I do use white sage and sell it at the shop, I make smudge bundles with my garden sage. It does have a similar aroma and when your smudging, it is the intention that counts. I I know this is woo-woo but ask your plant if it would like to help you clear energies or space and then listen. I also use yarrow, eastern cedar, lavender, mullein and seasonal flowers to create smudging sticks. Culinary Uses: Make the fresh or dried herb as a tea with a little fresh lemon juice and honey after dinner to help with digestion. Also if your growing sage, add sprigs of it to your roast veggies and meats. It's really strong so a little bit will do you. Traditional Medicinal Uses: So many to list (honestly it goes on and on) but main uses include fungal treatments (see recipe below for a powerful foot bath),digestion excessive sweating, sore throats, colds and flu, oral care, hot flashes, boost brain function, lowering cholesterol and to support type 2 Diabetes. See below for herbal nerd alert. Energy and Manifesting: Smudging is an ancient practice that I love. I often refer to the plants as our grandmothers and grandfathers of spirit, they know what we need and I cleanse my space almost every day to make sure that or any negativity. Sage in particular, I burn when I need to rid the body and fields of conflict, anger, illness or evil. It also is used for purification of space and use when to shift directions or after directions shift for you (illness, death, moving, negative person or thing). Medicinal Recipe Sage Foot Soak to help with athlete's foot, tired feet, sore or swollen feet, smelly feet, diabetic foot sores and more. Add 1 cup of fresh or dried sage and a \u00bd cup fresh or dried sage to a container that can hold your feet.
