Learn about our Editorial Process Updated on May 09, 2019 Sweetgrass (Hierochloe odorata) gets its name from its sweet, aromatic fragrance, and is an important substance in a variety of New Age healing practices and in herbal healing science. The plant is native to much of northern Eurasia and North America and can grow as for north as the Arctic Circle. It is sometimes distilled for a flavored vodka, and also is used in basket-weaving. Like many New Age practices, the use of sweetgrass for spiritual purposes is actually very old. Native American indigenous people regarded Sweetgrass as a sacred medicine, and even today is a standard substance used in shamanic healing. New Age Uses Burned as an incense, sweetgrass is valued for its vanilla-like scent. Clippings of sweetgrass are usually braided and then dried prior to burning. When burned for healing or ritual purposes, the smoke from the braided sweetgrass is thought to attract good spirits and positive energies. It is used as a smudging tool to purify peoples auras, cleanse objects, and clear ceremonial areas or healing spaces of negative energy. Sweetgrass can also be carried or worn as a protective amulet. The plant is also used in basket weaving.
