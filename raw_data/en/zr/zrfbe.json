A part of Chinese medicine, tai chi combines gentle movement, deep breathing techniques and meditation. Movements create stability in the body, reflecting an ancient Chinese concept of balance known as [Yin and Yang](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/whole-medical-systems/#beliefs-behind-chinese-medicine). Why use it The breath work of tai chi is calming and meditative. Creating and holding the poses helps to loosen and strengthen the muscles. Tai chi can be modified for groups that are less mobile. What to expect During class there will be serene music playing. The class usually starts with warm-up exercises. You will be shown different moves and assisted to perform them. The instructor may use names to describe the poses, for example, \"white crane spreads its wings\". The movements are simple to start with, then become progressively harder, with many parts of the body needing to move to achieve the pose. The class ends with cooling down and relaxation. What is the evidence? Studies have shown that tai chi improves quality of life, balance, agility, flexibility and muscle tone in cancer survivors. It may also help reduce fatigue, anxiety, depression and stress.
