SH-141 Senate Off ice Building Washington D.C. 20510 Dear Maureen: Thank you for taking the time to meet with Nicole and myself. We appreciate your interest and support. Several developments have taken place since we met with you so we need to bring you up to date. We returned to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A117 committee meeting and learned that the chairman had announced that ANSI had no funds for research, and therefore, had no interest in participating in any study regarding the needs of the visually disabled and the technology available from sign manufacturers. As a result, of ANSI's action, it appears that the only way to accomplish any research effort with creditability is to have a research project conducted by one of the blind organizations with cooperation from other blind organizations and sign manufacturers. A major problem in this regard is that two of the ANSI members, The National Council of the Blind and The American Foundation for the Blind, have strongly opposing views on most issues pertinent to the visually impaired. You could help on this research matter if you could suggest an organization for the visually impaired that might lead the research team. Also any sources of funding that you could suggest would be very helpful. Another area of great concern is the ANSI A117 committee itself. After observing an additional two days of their actions, we do not feel that the ANSI A117 committee is capable or willing to function as a cohesive group. It is obvious that the core of ANSI A117 committee members (who represent building code related organizations) resent having to deal with members from organizations for the disabled. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 9 of 175The message to us was loud and clear. The only way the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements will be implemented is through the Department of Justice (DOJ) and civil rights action. Another negative development is that the proposed regulations that the DOJ will issue in August for comment are for Title II which pertains only to requirements for state and local governments. There is no assurance that the DOJ and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB) will act upon the responses to the proposed regulations by amending title III. However, the Assistant Attorney General did comment on this in his letter to the Engraver's Journal. A copy of the article published in the Journal is enclosed. As a result of the situation described above, I believe that the intent of the Attorney General in issuing the letter to the editor of the Engraver's Journal is a very important issue. The Department of Justice technical manual (copy of excerpt enclosed) uses bathrooms, room numbers and exits as examples for permanent signs. The letter of John R. Dunne, Assistant Attorney General, states \"the only signs subject to the raised letter requirement are men's and women's rooms, room numbers and exit signs\". This interpretation simply can not be in the spirit of the intent of Congress in passing the ADA. The staff attorney that Nicole and I met with last Wednesday stated that I would receive a response to my letter. Depending on their response, I may feel the need to write another letter to the Attorney General. If so, I will send you a copy and ask for your assistance at that time. Again, thank you for your time and assistance. Sincerely, I ~_V;~il-1 -/!J Jt?~ Dennis G. Redd Vice President This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 10 of ecently, The En-.A gravers Journal was invited to meet with the Architectural On March 25, The Engravers Journal met and exchanged views with the Architectural & Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Here's an account of the ADA and UFAS situation. & Transportation Bar- rie rs Compliance Board (ATBCB) and the A TBCB is that the kind of accessible signage she feels is the most tactually readable by the blind -signs with incised, engraved Department of Justice to discuss \"your industry's concerns about the ADA.\" We accepted the invitation and the meeting took place March 25, 1992, in the offices of the A TBCB in Washington. Present were 3 A TBCB Board members (all with different disabilities), 3 Justice Depart- ment representatives, and 4 ATBCB staff members. Co-publisher of The Engravers Journal, Michael J. Davis, attended the meeting and he invited Bee Hodgkiss, owner of an engraving business in Minneapolis, to attend. What makes Bee Hodgkiss eminently qualified to represent the engraving ind us try on this particular issue is that, in addition to owning an engraving business, she is congenitally blind (blind from birth). Bee is a member of the National Federation of the Blind and an outspoken proponent of the rights of the blind to have fullaccessibility and mobility throughout society. She has been making and selling \"accessible signage\" (including Grade 2 Braille) since long before passage of the ADA. One of the reasons Bee was happy to meet with the The Engraver s Journal May/June 1992 characters -has been outlawed by the ADA regulations. Bee also believes that the current ADA regulations do not go far enough in providing mobility for the visually impaired. The early part of the meeting consisted of an exchange of ideas and information. The Board members had many questions about the industry, how it is structured, and the equipment and methods engravers use. This was followed by the Board's explanation of how the A TBCB works, including some of the difficult con- ditions under which they operate. According to A TBCB General Counsel, Jim Raggio, one problem they face is that the ADA covers about 40 different areas, everything from building construction to telephones, shower stalls, and wheelchair lifts on buses. Signage is just one area they must oversee. According to Jim Raggio, there are two primary areas where the A TBCB chronically falls short: technical ex- continued on page 35 15 This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 11 of 175OPERATION ACCESSIBLE continued from page 15 pertise and funding. Research is the key to solving many accessibility prob- lems, and effective research requires having or finding both technical ex- pertise and funding. This year's A TBCB research budget is about $250,000 and in 1993, this will double to $500,000 ... Still, \"says Raggio, \"we have to sit down and make some very difficult decisions about which of the 40 areas of the ADA are the highest priority and where the research dollars will go.\" The subject of raised-letter-only signage was also discussed . Bee Hodg- kiss addressed the Board on the point that blind people have a preconceived bias against \"incised\" engraved char- acters, attributing this in part to braille, the language of the blind, being a raised medium. Therefore, some blind people think that lettering also must be raised, whereas she believes that incised lettering is as easy to read and a lot less expensive to produce. Another point made by Bee was that there are three types of signs: 1) Signs which comply with the ADA, 2) Signs which are usable by the blind, and 3) Junk signs. The ATBCB's Marsha Mazz, author of the ADA regulations, concurred with Bee that \"There are a lot of'junk' signs out there, and, from an acces- sibility standpoint, a junk sign is junk whether it has raised or incised char- acters,\" says Marsha Mazz. The Engravers Journal's Mike Davis added that our industry as a whole must plead guilty to producing in- accessible signage: subsurface signs or signs engraved .005\"-.010\" deep that range from very difficult to impossible to read tactually. Bee commented on a trend she saw developing at an ADA seminar in Las Vegas in February 1992, which she finds alarming to blind persons like herself. According to Bee, certain opportunists in the engraving industry are thumbing their nose at accessible signage by promoting multi-infor- mational signs where the room number is raised to comply with the ADA and other information on the sign is en- graved (incised). Unfortunately the incised lettering is reverse engraved (subsurface), making it impossible to The Engravers Journal May/June 1992 read tactually , whereas properly en- graved incised characters are very tactile. \"The trouble is,\" she says, \"as long as incised lettering is not recognized by the ADA, you will have this type of signage. You can't sell a customer on the idea of low cost accessible signage if the regulations say blind people can't read it, even though the regu- lations are wrong!\" After hearing the discussion, the A TBCB's Jim Raggio agreed that the \"incised lettering\" issue deserves a second look and more research, partic- ularly in view of the problems that have come to light with respect to the \"Georgia Tech. study\" on which the regulations were based.

You will be hearing a lot more about UFAS this year because UFAS has its own set of\"accessibility\" regulations affecting state, city, county and federal agencies, including the U.S. Postal Service and the military. two different UFAS signage standards and neither is in sync with the ADA regulations. For example, the Depart- ment of Defense, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and U.S. Postal Service do not require braille on signs and also recognize incised (engraved) characters as \"tac- tile\" (readable by touch) for purposes of providing accessibility to the blind. The General Services Administration (GSA) modified their standards in 1988 to require raised letters on signs The Title II (UF AS) sign regulations will be totally overhauled beginning this year.

The Engravers Journal will bring you more about UF AS later, but first, here is a status report on the ADA. One of the biggest sources of con- fusion about the ADA regulations has been the vagueness of its language, i.e. \"signs identifying permanent rooms and spaces\"must contain raised letters and braille. The Department of Justice has finally released a fairly straight- forward definition for \"permanent rooms and spaces\" which mandates raised letters and braille on only three types of signs: rest room signs, room numbers, and exit signs. As explained in our article, Clarifying the ADA Regulations (Mar/ Apr '92), the mechanics of putting the ADA regulations in force involved handing the regulations over to a committee of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ANSI is a private organization whose sole purpose is to create \"standards \"for almost anything. For example, an ANSI committee created the standard for the RS-232 computer interface, which allows you to buy a brand X computer and brand Y serial printer or modem and know that they are fully plug-compatible and will work properly together because the interface hardware is standardized. The committee coordinating the ADA is the ANSI Al 17 committee. Their proposed standards were released in the form of a \"public review draft\" on January 24, 1992, which was fol- lowed by a 60-day comment period that ended on March 24. \u00b7 One substantive change from the ADA regulations noted by The En- gravers Journal is a notation that \"Character heights shall be 5 / 8 in. ( 16 mm) minimum for building direct- ories.\" This differs from the ADA regulations in that building directories were defined as \"temporary\" in the regulations and are specifically ex- empted from ADA mandates. Another difference is that \"Braille shall be placed a nominal I/ 2 in. ( 13 mm) below the corresponding raised characters or symbols ... \" The Journal filed a written objection to this pro- vision, reasoning that on a two-line sign, containing the word \"FIRE\" on line I and \"EXIT\" on line 2, for example, the ANSI document's lan- guage explicitly mandates that the May/June 1992 The Engravers Journal This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 13 of 175OPERATION ACCESSIBLE continued from page 37 drafted to closely parallel the ADA regulations or the ADA regulations must be modified to conform reason- ably closely to whatever the UFAS standards are. And in the election-year politics of 1992, President Bush may have over- extended the federal budget by prom- ising in his State of the Union address to provide federal funding for new federal mandates that must be paid for by state and local governments. Major changes in U FAS sign regulations could cost American taxpayers plenty. as every city hall, public school, county courthouse. college campus, Y.A. hos- pital. public library. etc .. replaces certain signs and sends the bill to Washington. So where does this leave the blind and the accessibility that was promised to them by the spirit and intent of the ADA? The ADA has given the blind CIRCLE 28 ON AD EXPRESS 38 only the most rudimentar y of acces- sibility: tactile rest room. room number. and exit signs. Picture yourself trying to find your way around a large building or airport wearing a blindfold. where all you could detect were the rest rooms. exits, and room numbers. if there were room numbers! It would appear that the blind have been short- changed by the ADA! Many mistakes have been made in the ADA. $1.3 million was spent on the \"Georgia Tech. study\" upon which the ADA regulations are based. This study and the problems associated therewith were detailed in The En- gravers Journal's article What the A DA Means to Our Industry (Nov Dec '9 l ). The Justice Department's official comment about the study is that they will neither confirm nor deny any problems associated with it. The existing language of the ADA regulations is also problematical. i.e. \"signs identifying permanent rooms and spaces\" and \"signs which are temporary .\" The first part of the definition refers to the space and the second refers to the sign. concepts which cannot always be reconciled. Likewise. an exit sign does not identify a permanent room or space (it's really a directional sign that points the direction or path of egress from the building). Perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that at every stage of the ADA's evolution . the sign producer s have been totally excluded from the planning and discussions . All of the committees have been dominated by the handi- capped. Indeed. virtually the entire sign industry found out about the ADA only after the regulation s were finalized and the comment period was over. Had our industry been invo!Yed in the \"Georgia Tech. study,\" the cost would have been 90o/c less and the study would have been done properly. and the blind would have had \"acces- sible\" signage years ago! Had our industry had input into the ADA. we probably would have sug- gested orienting the requirements around the sign message, i.e. the type of information contained on the sign. The identification of permanent rooms and spaces is just one type of infor- mation. Safety warning messages arc another. A third type of information specifies the means of egress (exits). May/June 1992 The Engra\\'ers .Journal This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 14 of 175and a fourth might apply to directional information . Still another type of information pertains to instructions for operating \"architectural equipment\" such as automatic doors, elevators , and escalators. Only a tiny fraction of this vital information can be available to the blind under the current \"perma- nent rooms and spaces\" focus of the ADA. To continue using the current regulations , the Justice Department must badly contort the English lan- guage in such a way as to attempt to force-fit the information contained on a particular sign to match the ADA definition. For example, what \"perma- nent room or space\" is identified by an exit sign on an exterior door? Do the boundaries of this \"permanent space\" stop at the property line or extend onward to encompass the entire country? Our industry is well experienced in producing all types of signs and you, our readers, know what is needed. Our intention here is not to belabor past or current problems or \"beat up\" our officials in Washington . The En- gravers Journal's articles and your letters have caused 12 congressional inquiries into the ADA sign regulations and inquiries by President George Bush and Attorney General William P. Barr. Enough \"heat\" has been generated and it's time now to take positive steps to make America accessible. Our in- dustry, the government and the blind must start working together for a change. In the near future, the A TBCB's General Counsel, Jim Raggio, will be issuing a \"Notice for Proposed Rule Making\" (NPRM) whereby new data or proposals to support changes in the UF AS regulations will be sought. In turn, the Justice Department has agreed to evaluate any such proposals, and if they have merit, to change the ADA regulations to conform to the new UF AS regulations, as indicated in the Assistant Attorney General's Jetter shown in figure I. The greatest accomplishment of the ADA has been to give everyone a different perspective. If you have con- sulted with any visually impaired individual s or the organizations for the blind, for example in researching Grade 2 Braille, you have probably developed a heightened sensitivity toward their opinions and problems. The Engravers Journal May/June 1992 Interestingly, the same thing has hap- pened in reverse, whereby the blind have come to better understand many of the problems associated with pro- ducing the accessible signs they so badly need and deserve. As a result of The Engravers Journal's meeting with the Architect- ural and Transportation Barriers Com- pliance Board, we formulated a clearer picture of how government functions, and we believe that the A TBCB and Justice Department know where our industry stands. It is imperative that our industry provide signage that is accessible to the blind. The Engravers Journal advocates this not because you, our readers, stand to profit by it, but because it's the right thing to do in a humanitarian sense! Profits are in- cidental. We have to start thinking about accessibility, not about com- pliance, and promoting this idea to continued on next page m PARKER TH LARGST MAllUllACTURlllR 011 THRADDROD Available from stock for immediate delivery THREADED ROD 1/2\" to 20\" in 1/2\" increments FERRULES COUPLINGS TROPHY LOCK & FLAT WASHERS PICTURE PENDERS SAWTOOTH HANGERS All cartons conform to UPS specifications. ~arr=@ MADE IN U.S.A. ~ IOJ PARKER METAL CORPORATION P. 0.

The existing ADA regulations are ill-founded and need to be changed. In time they need to be expanded to provide true accessibility to the handi- capped, not just the bare-bones ap- proach of rest rooms. room numbers, and exit signs. The solution to the ADA problems cannot be solved by the government and cannot be solved by our industry alone. What's needed is a partnership, where the private and public sectors work together, rather than at cross purposes. The industry needs to mo- bilize.

TRAINING AND CONSUL TING SERVICES Changes Sweep The Workplace As ADA Laws Take Effecl .. On July 26, 1990, President George Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act. This act has been recognized by companies across the United States as the most sweeping civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Companies must prepare themselves for the legislation that becomes effective for employers with 25 or more employees on July 26, 1992 and employers with 15 or more employees on July 26, 1994. The intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is to prevent discrimination in the areas of employment, public services, transportation, public accommodations, and telecommunication services against qualified people who have disabilities. What the ADA means to companies and their managers is that they cannot screen out individuals with disabilities in the hiring process, nor can they discriminate in any area of employment, including compensation, promotions, benefits, or firing. Companies will no longer be able to conduct pre-employment medical screening, with the exception of drug screening, or make pre-employment inquiries into the nature of an applicant's disability . Companies must be aware of physical barriers in their work environment. All companies will also need to have an up-to-date , relevant job description for each position.

Predictions are that by the year 2000, the majority of new entrants to the U.S. laborforce will be women, American people of color, and immigrants. In order for employers to remain competitive and/or operate with maximum efficiency, it is imperative that employees from widely diverse backgrounds appreciate and respect their differences and be able to work together effectively in the job environment. PURPOSE The purpose of Professional Training Systems' diversity training is: To demonstrate to employees that the demographics of the American workforce are rapidly and dramatically changing, that the resulting need is for \"cultural competence\" in the workplace, the advantages to all of acquiring (and the consequences of not acquiring) the knowledge and skills necessary to work effectively in a multi-cultural environment; To raise employer awareness of the ways in which individuals can be unconsciously and inadvertently culturally insensitive, and To have employees practice new behaviors to which they are introduced in the workshop.

The workshop includes use of adult learning techniques, including video, role play, simulations, small work group, large group discussion and lecturettes . OBJECTIVES At the end of the workshop, participants will be able to: Explain the concept of cultural diversity and its effects on the American labor force; Articulate the benefits of cultural competence on the work environment; Elucidate the adverse effects which cultural insensitivity has on both individuals and the work environment; Identify how theirown cultural identity impacts their attitudes, assumptions and expectations during personal and professional interactions; More effectively identify potentially offensive speech and action before engaging in it; More effectively remove cultural barriers in culturally charged conflicts, and Work more consciously and sensitively with their colleagues who are different from themselves by race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, and physical ability/disability. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 28 of 175PREVENTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT Each year, American employers pay millions of dollars in jury awards and settlement agreements in sexual harassment cases . They also lose millions of dollars as a result of low productivity, low morale, employee tardiness, employee absenteeism and other effects of the presence of sexual harassment in the workplace. The best way to avoid having to pay large jury awards and/or settlement agreements in sexual harassment cases is to avoid the initial filing of complaints of sexual harassment. PURPOSE The purpose of Professional Training Systems ' sexual harassment prevention training is: To empower employers when faced with sexual harassment in their work environment by teaching effective skills for responding to sexual harassment, and To inform employees of both the informal and formal mechanisms for addressing sexual harassment. DESCRIPTION \"Preventing Sexual Harassment\" focuses on improving the work environment by utilizing strategies for both preventing sexual harassment and diffusing potentially hostile situations involving sexual harassment. The workshop is designed to inform participants of the behaviors , rather than the attitudes, which meet the legal definition of sexual harassment.

How does sexual harassment affect the harassed employee? How does it affect the work environment? How common is sexual harassment in the workplace?); Describe the legal consequences of sexual harassment for the harasser; Identify informal, personal \"empowerment\" actions employees can take to stop sexual harassment , either that the employee is receiving her/himself, or that the employee sees in the work environment; Outline the complaint process from within the organization to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Provide opportunity for questions regarding personal/organizational experiences with sexual harassment.

'!his is the sane definition used for ?JIPOSes of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the recent arcendnents to the Fair Housing Act. TITLE I: GENERAL PRCHIBITIOO AGAINST DISCRIMINATIOO Title I sets out the general follDS of discrimination prohibited by the Act. It is considered discriminatory to subject an individual, directly or indirectly, on the basis of handicap, to any of the following: ( 1) denying the opportunity to participate in or benefit fran an opportunity; (2) affording an opportunity that is not equal to that afforded others; (3) providing opportunities that are less effective than that provided to others; (4) providing an individual with opportunities in a segregated setting; ( 5) aiding or pei:petuating discrimination by providing significant assistance to others that discriminate; ' ( 6) denying an q;p:>rtunity to participate as a nenber of a planning or advisory board; and (7) otheJ:wi.se limiting an individual with a handicap in the enjoynent of any right, privilege, advantage, or ogx>rtunity enjoye:l by others.

Further, an entity ma.y not di.I:ectly or indirectly use criteria or nethods of administration that have the effect of subjecting an individual to discrimination an the basis of handicap or perpetuate discrimination by others 'Who are subject to camon administrative cxntrol or are agencies of the same State. Nor can an entity discriminate against an individual because of the association of that individual with another individual with a handicap. Title I also sets out several defenses to allegations of discrimination. It is not oonsidered discrimination to exclude or deny opportunities to an individual w:jth a handicap for reasons entirely unrelatai to his or handicap. Further, it is not discrimination to exclude or deny opportunities to an individual with a handicap baserl on the application of qualification standards or other criteria that are shown by a covererl entity to be both necessary and substantially relatai to the ability of the individual to perfonn or participate or take advantage of an awortunity and such participation cannot be accanplisherl by applicable :reasonable accc:mrodations, m:x:lifications, or the provision of auxilairy aids or services. ~lif ication standards ma.y include requiring that the current use of alcohol or drugs by an alcohol or drug abuser not pose a direct tlu:eat to property or the safety of others in the \\\\Urkplace or program; and requiring that an individual with a currently contagious disease or infection not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the \\\\Urkplace or program. 'lhese defenses are canparable to the defenses currently applicable to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. TITLE II: Elw1PIDYMENl' 'lhe provisions in title II of the Act use or inoorporate by reference nany of the definitions in title VII of the Civil Rights .Act of 1964 (enployee,\u00b7enployer, Canni.ssion, labor organization, affecting c:x::rmerce).

A \"qualifierl individual with a handicap\" neans an individual with a han:licap who, with or without :reasonable accamo:Jation, can perfonn the essential functions of the arploynent position that such individual holds or desires. 'lhis definition is canparable to the definition used for ?1l:J?OSe6 of section 504. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 40 of 175Using the section 504 legal framawork as the m:xiel, the bill specifies that no entity covered by the Act shall discriminate against any qualified i.Irlividual with a handicap because of such i.Irlividual's handicap in :regard to application procedures, the hiring or discharge of employees and all tenns, conditions and privileges of employnent. 'lhus, discrimination includes, for exanple, the failure by a covered entity to make reasonable accxmoodatians to the known limitations of a qualified i.Irlividual with a handicap unless such entity can dem:mstrate that the acxx:nucdation would inp:>se an undue hardship on the operation of the business. Discrimination also includes the denial of aIJ:>loynent q:p:>rtunities because a qualified i.Irlividual with a handicap nea:is a reasonable acc::armJdation. '!he definition of the tenn \"reasonable accxmoodation\" included in the bill is canparable to the definition in the section 504 legal franework. Discrimination also includes the imposition or application of qualification standards and other criteria that identify or limit a qualified i.Irlividual with a handicap unless such standards or criteria can be shown by such entity to be necessary and substantially related to the ability of the i.Irlividual to perfonn the essential canponents of the particular employnent position.

Does not contain such language. Definitions: 1. \"Handicap\" defined as in Section 504. 2. a) Term \"individual with handicaps\" is not defined. b) In section on general prohibition against discrimination, allows covered entity to: set a qualification standard that current users of alcohol or drugs not pose a direct threat to property or safety (but says nothing about ability to perform the job); and to require that contagious persons not present a direct threat to health or safety (but says nothing about ability to perform the job). 1.

GENERAL PROHIBITION ON DISCRIMINATION 1. Four pages of highly prescriptive, speciric prohibitions and defenses, some of which are drawn from Section 504 regulations, including use of discriminatory effects standard.

New buses and trains purchased 30 days after date of enactment must be readily accessible. No retrofitting of existing vehicles. 3. Used buses purchased after the date of enactment need not be accessible but a good faith effort to locate a used accessible bus must be made. 4.

New vehicles purchased by public accommodations that carry in excess of 12 passengers must be accessible.

Four pages of prescriptions, including many exceeding Section 504: e.g. bans eligibility criteria that tend to identify or limit an individual with a handicap from \"fully and equally enjoying any goods, services, etc.\" --no matter how justified the criteria. 3.

This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 52 of 175Talking Points I APPRECIATE THE NEW DEFINITION OF \"HANDICAP\" AND THE EFFORT TO I MA.KE THE STANDARDS AND BURDENS CONFORM BETTER TO SECTION 504 THAN THE ORIGINAL BILL, ALTHOUGH I THINK MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS. '--------I AM STILL VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MA.NY ASPECTS OF THE 3/14 DRAFT, RANGING , FROM SOME SMALLER MATTERS TO MUCH LARGER ONES. 1. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPANSION OF THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING USED BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS OR VISITORS OR THAT ARE POTENTIAL PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT, GOES WELL BEYOND EXISTING FEDERAL LAW (TITLE II OF THE 1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT) TO COVER VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.BUT PRIVATE HOMES. IT INCLUDES NOT JUST PLACES OF ENTERTA \u00b7INMENT AND FOOD AND DRINK, BUT EVERY PRIVATE BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRY. THE ANALOGY TO SECTION 1981, DEALING WITH THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS OF MINORITIES, IS INAPPROPRIATE AS A MODEL, TITLE II IS THE OBVIOUS PAR.A.LELL. THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT OF SECTION 1981 --IF YOU WANT TO PARALLEL SEC. 1981, DROP IN A BILL TO AMEND IT. I AM PREPARED TO EXTEND TITLE II'S COVERAGE TO HANDICAP, BUT I RECOGNIZE THERE ARE .COSTS INVOLVED AND TO IMPOSE THEM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PRIVATE SECTOR IS UNREASONABLE. PLUS, THIS OVERBROAD PROVISION WILL ELICIT OPPOSITION WE DON'T NEED. 2. RELIEF. MOREOVER, UNDER TITLE II, RELIEF IS WHOLLY PREVENTIVE AND EQUITABLE. NEITHER PRIVATE PARTIES NOR THE GOVERNMENT CAN OBTAIN DAMAGES. THIS BILL APPLIES THE NEW FAIR HOUSING ACT REMEDIES TO PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS AND OTHER AREAS. Th'ESE REMEDIES INCLUDE CIVIL PENALTIES AND COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN ATTNY. GEN. ACTIONS AND ACTUAL AND PUNITIVE DP.Jvl..AGES IN A PRIVATE ACTION. THE USE OF SECTION 1981 REMEDIES IN EMPLOYMENT, IN ADDITION TO TITLE 7 REMEDIES, rs AN EXPANSION OF CURRENT FEDERAL LAW. UNDER TITLE VII, THERE IS A TWO YEAR LIMIT ON BACKPAY; YOU GET THE NEXT AVAILABLE JOB AND RETROACTIVE SENIORITY. UNDER SECTION 1981, YOU GET UNLIMITED BACKPAY, COMPENSATORY DP~~GES, AND A RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. PLUS, SECTION 1981 ONLY BANS INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION, WHEREAS THIS BILL BANS EFFECTS DISCRIMINATION, SO THESE HARSHER REMEDIES APPLY TO MORE CONDUCT THAN EVEN SEC. 1981 DOES. WE SHOULD NOT BE PUNITIVE nERE. EXCEPT FOR EMPLOYMENT, WHERE I AM PREPARED TO USE THE TITLE VII REMEDIES, W-fiY NOT PROVIDE FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, IN BOTH FEDER..1i.L GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE LAWSUITS, PLUS ATTORNEY'S FEES IN PRIVATE LAWSUITS. 3. , TRANSPORTATION. THERE IS NO LOCAL OPTION FOR PARATR..1.NSIT IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTION. WHILE I AM PREPARED TO LISTEN I I I I I This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 53 of 175TO THE CASE FOR YOUR TRANSPORTATION SECTION, I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE BURDENS IMPOSED HERE. MA.NY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS SEEM TO REFLECT PORTIONS OF A REGULATION TH.AT EVEN JUDGE Mir.:YA THREW OUT IN A 1981 D.C. COURT OF. APPEALS DECISION. CASEL>.W IS SPLIT ON WHETHER ALL NEW BUSES AND SUBWAYS MUST BE ACCESSIBLE--I THINK ONLY ONE OF 3 OR 4 DECISIONS CALLS FOR THIS. 7\\U. PLUS, WHY ARE, OPENING UP THE PANDORA'S BOX OF AMENDING SECTION 504 IN THIS AREA? THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THIS SECTION GOES BEYOND SECTION 504. IF YOU OPEN UP SECTION 504, I MAY WANT TO REVISIT PARTS OF SECTION 504 THAT I MAY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH. FOR EXAMPLE, I HAVE PREVIOUSLY BOUGHT OFF ON THE CONTAGIOUS DISEASE PROVISION, BUT ITS NOT IDEAL. IF I DONT' TRY TO ADDRESS IT, SOMEONE ELSE WILL. 4. THE BILL IS FAR TOO PRESCRIPTIVE, INCORPORATING PAGES OF MATERIAL BETTER LEFT TO AGENCY RULE-MAKING. PORTIONS OF THE BILL ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN SECTION 504. QUALIFICATION STANDARDS, SELECTION CRITERIA, PERFORMANCE CRITERIA MUST BE \"BOTH NECESSARY AND SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED TO THE ABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO PERFORM OR PARTICIPATE RATHER THAN A REASONABLE RELATIONSHIP. IN THE PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS SECTION, THE DRAFT BANS ELEGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT TEND TO IDENTIFY OR LIMIT AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A HANDICAP FROM \"FULLY AND EQUALLY ENJOYING ANY GOODS, SERVICES,\" ETC., NO MATTER HOW JUSTIFIED THE CRITERIA. THIS SECTION DOES NOT FULLY AND CLEARLY INCORPORATE THE SECTION 504 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY, THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR A COVERED ENTITY TO UNDERTAKE AN UNDUE BURDEN OR FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATION. YOU'VE NOT USED BOTH CONCEPTS WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED. THE REQUIREMENT THAT A COVERED PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION MUST REMOVE \"ARCHITECTUAL AND COMMUNICATIONS BARRIERS THAT ARE STRUCTURAL IN EXISTING FACILITIES, AND TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS IN EXISTING VEHICLES ... WHERE SUCH REMOVAL IS READILY ACHIEVABLE\" SOUNDS LIKE IT GOES BEYOND SECTION 504. SECTION 504 DOES NOT REQUIRE UNDERTAKING UNDUE BURDENS OR FUNDAMENTAL ALTERATIONS, \"READILY ACHIEVABLE\" MAY REQUIRE MORE OF A COVERED ENTITY. 5. EXCEPT FOR EMPLOYMENT WHERE THE 3/14 DRAFT HAS A 15 PERSON LIMIT, THERE IS NO SMALL PROVIDER EXCEPTION. WE SEEK AN EXCEPTION ACROSS-THE-BOARD FOR ENTITIES OF LESS THAN 25 EMPLOYEES. 6. THE DRAFT DOES NOT OUTRIGHT EXCLUDE ALCOHOLICS AND DRUG ABUSERS, ONLY ALLOWS A COVERED ENTITY TO SET QUALIFICATION STANDARDS wrlICH EXCLUDE THEM; NO EXCLUSION OF DRUG ADDICTS OR HOMOSEXUALS. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 54 of 1757. THE FINDINGS CLAUSES STILL ATTEMPT TO CREATE A \"SUSPECT\" CLASS UNDER THE 14TH.AMENDMENT, IN THE FACE OF SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT, CLEBURNE, THAT DISABLED PERSONS ARE NOT A SUSPECT CLASS. IF HANDICAPPED PERSONS ARE REGARDED AS SUSPECT CLASS, NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN HANDICAPPED AND NONHANDICAPPED WOULD SURVIVE STRICT SCRUTINY. 8. COMMUNICATIONS. I PREFER TO MAKE TELEVISION BROADCASTERS TELEVISE THEIR VIDEOTAPES WITH CLOSED CAPTIONS. YOU HAVE A PROVISION REQUIRING TELEPHONE COMPANIES TO HAVE A TELECOMMUNICATIONS RELAY SYSTEM. THIS WOULD ALLOW PERSON WITH A TDD TO CALL A PERSON WITHOUT A TDD. OPEN MIND ON THIS, AND I'LL WANT TO~EAR TESTIMONY PHONE COMPANIES AS WELL AS DEAF PERSONS ON THIS. A DEAF I'LL KEEP AN FROM THE I WANT FAIR AND BALANCED HEARINGS ON ALL OF THE CATEGORIES COVERED BY THE BILL. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 55 of 175. , ,,. ~ 3/~4/89 Section 1. This SECTIO~~~ON ANALYSIS section provides t~t the Act may be ref erred to as the Equal Opportunity Act of 1989. Section 2. Congressional Findings and Purpose. This section -sets forth findings concerning discrimination against individuals with handicaps and the purpose of eliminating such discrimination in certain activities. Section 3. General Definitions. This section defines terms generally applicable throughout the Act. Subsection (1) defines the term \"individual with handicaps\" in a manner similar to the definition applicable to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 29 U.S.C. 706(8) (B). One difference between the two definitions is that in this Act's definition, the exclusion of alcoholics and persons who are addicted \u00b7to, or dependent on, lawfully prescribed drugs is applicable not only to employment, as under Section 504, when such persons' current use of alcohol or drugs prevents them from performing the job in question or constitutes a direct threat to the property or safety of others, but also to participation in programs. There is no sound reason for excluding from coverage a person unable to -1- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 56 of 175p21.\u00b7form a job or who thre3tens t r.e propE:r~y er safety cf or.hers as an employee because of alcoholism or drug dependency, and not to exc~ude the same person who is unable to perform the requirements necessary to participate in a program or whose participation threatens the property and safety of others, for the same reason. This makes explicit in the Act itself the way the Act would likely operate in these latter situations through agency and judicial interpretation of the term \"qualified individual w.i th handicaps, \" i.e. a person who is unable to participate in a program or who threatens the property or safety of others due to alcoholism or drug dependency is not \"otherwise qualified\" to participate. The definition also takes into account how the term is used in the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 (CRRA), Pub. L. No. 100-259, and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (FHA), Pub. L. No. 100-430. Subsection (2)(A) provides that \"qualified individual with handicaps\" means, with respect to employment, a person who is able to perform the essential functions of the job in question in spite of his or her handicap, or who could do so if reasonable accommo~acion were made for the handicap. Subsection (2) (B) provides that, with respect to all other activities covered by this Act, a \"qualified individual with handicaps\" means a person who can meet the essential eligibility requirements for participation in, or receipt of benef~ts from, such activities, or who could do so if reasonable accommodation -2- I I This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 57 of 175,,\u00b7e.:::-e mode for tLe har.d.icap. ~any such activit:i2s have :10 eligibility criteria that requires performance or have .. merely nominal criteria and subsection (2)(8) refers to them as well. For example, many places of public accommodation have no criteria for entry, or impose nominal ones such as a cover charge or a dress requirement. An individual with a handicap who can afford the cover charge or meets the dress requirement, and who can gain access to the facility with or without reasonable accommodation, is otherwise qualified to patronize that place of public accommodation. In short, both of these terms are generally used in the same manner as current Section 504 regulations such as the defintions contained in the Department of Justice's regulation applicable to its own activities, 39 CFR 103, with the broadened exclusion of alcoholics and drug dependents and the additional exclusions based on the CRRA and the FHA. \"Reasonable accommodation\" is used in the same way it is used in interpretations of Sec~ion 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. An employer must undertake a reasonable accomodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a person with handicaps if doing so is necessary to permit the person to perform the essential functions of the job, but need not make fundamental alterations in the nature of the program or undertake undue financial and administrative burdens, or, in -3-I I I This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 58 of 175other words used in regulations with respect t.o employment, incur an undue hardship. Similarly, an entity operating any other activity covered by this Act must make reasonable accommodation to the handicapping condition of a person if doing so enables the person to participate in the covered program, subject to the limitation that the entity need not fundamentally alter its program or undertake an undue financial and administrative burden. Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397 (1979); see Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. -. 287, 300 (1985); Dopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); American Public Transit Association v. Lewis, 655 F.2d 1272(0.C. Cir. 1981); Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir. 1983); Nelson v. Thornburgh, 567 F. Supp. 369 (E.D. Pa. 1983). The inclusion of the reasonable accommodation concept is to ensure that the substantive standard applicable under the Act, i.e. the standard for determining liability, is that which exists under Section 504, as generally construed under recent federal agency regulatory provisions and Section 504 caselaw. In effect, this Act extends the protections of Section 504 to the activities to which it applies. In applying Davis, courts have recognized that the determination that an accommodation is \"reasonable\" must be based on the specific circumstances of each case, but that the entity operating the covered activity may be required to incur more than minimal expense as long as -4- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 59 of 175tl.e reque:>ted a-::co1. ;r.,odat.i.cn does not c::.r,:;ti.tute en undl,;e burden. The reasonable accommodation requireir.ent. under this Act, therefore, requires more on the part of an employer than the reasonable accommodation requirement with respect to religion in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The latter provision has been construed to require that an employer undertake no more than de minirnis cost. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977). In the employment context, the. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's -definition provides guidance, 29 CFR 1613.704. In the other contexts covered by this Act, regulations such as the Department of Justice's regulation covering its own activities, e.g. 39 CFR 39.150; id .. 151; id .. 160, provide general guidance. Each agency which must promulgate regulations to implement this Act may adapt the general guidance provided by these regulations and relevant caselaw to the specific type of activity covered. Section 4. Construction. Subsection (a) makes clear that this Act does not disturb the enforcement of the nondiscrimination provisions of title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the rights, remedies, and substantive standards thereunder. Subsection (b) makes clear that nothing in this Act bars conduct against a person either (1) because the person \u00b7has been -5- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 60 of 175or (2) because of the per~on\u00b7s 52Aual orientation. Subsection (c) provides that this Act shall not apply to programs or activities covered by Sections 503 or 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or to any air carrier subject to the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986. Subsection (d) provides that the Act does not apply to any -entity merely because that entity is licensed or regulated by a state or local government agency or department or because it receives any assistance from such agency or department. If a state or subdivision of a state passes along federal financial assistance, as part of a federal aid program, to any entity, of course, the entity is subject to Section 504 according to Section 504's terms. Subsection (e) provides that this Act does not invalidate or limit any other federal, state, or local law providing greater protection than this Act. Section 5. Exclusion from coverage. This provision creates a blanket exclusion from coverage under the Act of any otherwise covered entity if it does not employ at least 25 employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceeding calendar year. -6-I I I This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 61 of 175Section 6.

This section bars those entities covered by the Act from re~al~uting against any person for opposing any act or practice made illegal under the Act, or because such person made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this Act. Section 7. Prohibition of discrimir.ation in employment. Subsection (a)(l) defines Commission to mean the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Subsection (a)(2) defines the term \"employer\" to include any person engaged in a business affecting interstate commerce who employs 25 or more persons. The definition excludes the United States Government, bona fide private clubs, and Indian tribes. These exclusions conform to those in Section 701 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, except that, consistent with section 5 of this Act, it excludes employers with 25 or more, rather than 15 or more, employees. Employees of the District of Columbia, who are not included within the scope of Section 701, are included within subsection (a) of this bill.

This subsection provides that the same procedures that are used to enforce title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will be used to enforce this section. Subsection (d). Regulations.

Section 8. Prohibition against discrimination in public accommodations. Subsection (a)(l) provides that the operations of an establishment \"affect commerce\" if the establishment meets the criteria in Section 20l(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Section 2000a(c). Subsection (a) (2) defines \"a place of public accommodation\" to include those listed in Sections 20l(b)(l)-(4), and excluding those listed in Section 20l(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C.\u00b7 Section 2000a(h)(l)-(4) and ( e). -9- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 64 of 175Subsection (b) bans discrimination against an other~ise qualified individual with handicaps, solely on the basis of handicap, in any place of public accommodations whose operations affect commerce.

Subsection (c)(3) provides that the District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over proceedings under this section and that aggrieved parties need not exhaust any administrative or other remedies. Subsection (d) authorizes the Attorney General to issue final regulations, no later than 10 months after enactment of this Act, he or she deems necessary to implement his or her responsibilities under this section and the bill' s anti-retaliation provision. -10- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 65 of 175Section 9. Prohibitions again~t discrimination in state and local government. Subsection (a) prohibits discrimination against othen.r_ise qualified individuals with handicaps, solely on the basis of his or her handicap, by any agency or department of a state or subdivision of a state. Subsection (b)(l) requires the Pre~ident, consistent with other provisions of the Act, to designate federal agencies to promulgate regulations to cover state and local government agencies and departments. The purpose of this section is to be sure that a federal agency is responsible for regulating each type of covered state and local agency and department, such as the Department of Health and Human Services for state and local health departments, the Environmental Protection Agency for state and local environmental agencies, and similar designations, and for processing complaints about violations of this section committed by such state and local agencies. These agencies may refer unresolved complaints to the Department of Justice. It is intended that overlap and duplication will be avoided by centralizing the designation process with the President. No agency may be designated i f i t does not have a Section 504 regulation in place. It is likely, given the purpose of this Act to apply generally the principles and standards of Section 504 to the areas covered by this Act, that designated agencies will be able to use their existing -11- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 66 of 175section or ev&n to extend their ~urrent regulations to-newly covered activities under this Act. Subsection (b)(2) requires that final regulations described in the preceding paragraph be issued no later than 10 months after the date of enactment. Subsection (b)(3) authorizes the Attorney General to seek injunctive and other equitable relief in a civil action, upon referral of an unresolved complaint from a federal agency. Subsection (b)(4) establishes a private right of action, pursuant to the procedures and remedies available under Sections 204(a) and (b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000a-3(a) and (b). These sections authorize a court to grant preventive relief and attorneys' fees. A private party need not, as under Sections 204(c) and (d) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, provide notice to any state or local government agency before initiating suit, nor await the referral of the complaint to the Department of Justice's Community Relations Service.

Subsection (a) provides that no otherwise qualified individal with handicaps shall be discriminated against in any services offered to the public for the transportation of persons by any state or local goverrun~nt agency. Accessibility under this provision can be provided in one of three ways without incurring an undue financial and administrative -burden: (1) taking steps to make accessible the mainline bus on subway systems; (2) providing paratransit services which are similar in route, time of service, and fare as the mainline system; or (3) a combination of mainline accessibility on some routes and paratransit services on others. Subsection (b) (1) provides that the Department of Transportation shall investigate and seek to conciliate complaints of violations of this section, and may refer unresolved complaints to the Department of Justice. Subsection (b)(2) authorizes the Attorney General to seek injunctive and other equitable relief in a civil action, upon referral of an unresolved complaint from the the Department of Transportation. -13- This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 68 of 175identicul to that tStaLl isht2d in 9 3).

Section 11. Television broadcasters. Subsection (a) provides that television stations which broadcast videotape programming or advertising shall do so with closed captions, provided that no television station need undertake an undue financial and administrative burden. This subsection is int--ded to impose the substantive requirements of Section 504 to a television station's broadcast of videotapes even when it does not receive federal financial assistance.

Like other agencies promulgating regulations under this Act, such regulations must reflect the undue financial and administrative burden limitation on the requirement to accommodate qualified individuals with handicaps. Particular factors that must be considered in determining whether undue financial and administrative burden in a specific case exists under this section, include the need for a television broadcaster to broadcast a videotape at a particular time, the cost of closed captioning, and the marketplace's capacity to close caption the volume of videotapes that are likely to fall within the requirements of this section. It is expected, however, that every television station will make significant and steady progress in close captioning the videotapes it uses over the shortest time feasible under the terms of this section. Section 12. Authorization of appropriations . This section authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act. Section 13. Effective date.

We have prepared the opinion and delivered it to the White House Counsel. In light of the controversial nature and complexity of legal issues raised by the AIDS virus, the White House Counsel has directed us to release this opinion and to be responsive to questions you may have abou~ it. I should also note at the out set that our legal opinion is cons1stent ~ith the President's policy statement of last August, namely that federal employers should treat HIV-infected individuals on a case by case basis so they do not pose health and safety dangers or performance problems. Otherwise, they should be treated like any other employee. In particular, our opinion focuses on two issues: (1) whether persons with AIDS are protected by the Rehabilitation Act as an individual with handicaps, even though AIDS is a contagious disease, and (2) whether so-called wasyrnptomatic HIV-infected persons are also \"individuals with handicaps for purposes of the Act. We answer both questions in the affirmative. We believe the first question was largely answered by the Supreme Court's decision in School Board of Nass~ u County, Fla. v. Arline (1987). Whil e Arline concerned tuberculosis rather than AIDS, it clearly held that n(a)llowing discrimination based on the contagious effects of a physical impairment would be inconsistent with the basic purpose of (the Rehabilitation Act]. As to asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals, our legal conclusions have been largely guided by recent medical clarification from the Surgeon General that even these individuals are, from a medical standpoint, physically impaired. The surgeon General advises us that the impairment of HIV infection cannot be meaningfully separated from clinical AIDS, and that it is medically inappropriate to think of this disease as composed of discrete conditions. Given this medical information that HIV infection is a physical impairment, the only legal issue remaining to us was to determine whether a court could in a given case determine that such a person is substantially limited in a major life activity. Because HIV infection may limit the likelihood of bearing a healthy child and may adversely affect intimate sexual relations, we believe that \"-an individual proving these facts to a court could fairly be found to be an individual with handicaps for purposes of the Act. \" -................... _.,,... ... ---..._...._ ... ,..,.

Culvahouse, Jr. Counsel t o the President ~e: Application of Section 504 of the Rehab1l1t3tion Act to HIV-Infected Individuals IL..trodu ct~on and Summary This memorandum responds t o your request for 3n opinion on the application of section 504 of the Rehabili tation Act of 1973 (Act), 29 U.S.C. 794, to individuals who are infected with the Human I:nmunodeficiency Virus (wHIVw or *AIDS virus). You specifically asked us to consider thi s subject in light of School Soard of Nassau County v, Arline, 107 s. ct. 1123 (1987) (Arline) . Congress has also sought to clarify the law in this area by amending the Rehabilitation Act to address directly the situation of contagious diseases and infections in the employment context. See Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-259, sec. 9, 102 Stat. 28, 31 (1988) (Civil Rights Restora- tion Act) . Although your opinion request was limited to the application of section 504 in the employment context, we have 3lso considered the non-employment context because the President has directed the Department of Justice to review all existing federal anti-d iscrimination law applicable in the HIV infection sontext and to make recommendations with respect to possible new legislation.l See Memorandum for the Attorney General from President Ronald Reagan (Aug. 5, 1988). For the reasons stated below, we have concluded, with respect to the non-employment context, that section 504 protects symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals2 against l We defer to others in the Department to make the policy determinations necessary to recommend legislation, and, in keeping with the tradition of this Off ice, confine our analysis to matters of legal interpretation. 2 In this opinion, individuals who are infected with the AIDS virus and have developed the clinical symptoms known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (wAIDSw) or AIDS-Related Complex (#ARC) will sometimes be referred to as symptomatic HIV-infected individuals.w Individuals who are infected with the (continued ... ) l This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 96 na~elf, :!IV- infected individual is only protected against discr :iation : f he or sne i s able to perform the dut~es of the job ~ joes not constitut:e a j irect threat to the health or safety of others .4 2 ( ... continued) AIDS virus but do not have AIDS or ARC will someti~es be referred to as \"asymptomatic HIV-infected indi'.liduals.\"' References t o AIDS should be understood t o include A.RC, except where a dis- tinction between the two is expressly drawn. Finally, where we intend to refer to all HIV-infected individuals, whether sympto- matic or not, we either refer to wHIV-1nfected individuals# or to \"'HIV infection# (without any #symptomatic or #asymp tomatic# rnodif ier) or clearly indicate in the text that the discussion refers to both categories. 3 The medical information available to us indicates that HIV infection is a physical impairment which in a given case may substantially limit a person's major life activities . See infra at 6-11. In addition, others may regard an HIV-infected person as being so impaired. See infra at 12-13. Either element in a given case, we believe, would be sufficient for a court to conclude that an HIV-infected person is an #individual with handicaps within the terms of the Act. By virtue of the fact that the handicap here, HIV infection, gives rise both to disab- ling physical symptoms and to contagiousness, it is unnecessary to resolve with respect to any other infection or condition which gives rise to contagiousness alone whether that singular fact could render a person handicapped. In other words, the medical information available to us undermines the accuracy of the assumption or contention referenced in Arline that carriers of the AIDS virus are without physical impairment. 107 s. ct. at 1128 n.7. 4 These conclusions differ from, and supersede to the extent of the difference, a June 20, 1986 opinion from Charles J. cooper, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, for Ronald E.

First, an individual claiming discriminatory treatment must be an individual with handicaps, as defined in the Act. Second, the individual must be otherwise qualified for the benefit or program participation being sought. Third, the individual must be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under a covered program or activity. Fourth, the contested treatment must be \"solely by reason of ... handicap. And fifth, the discrim ination must occur i n a program or activity conducted or funded by the federal govern- ment. The definition of program or activity is set forth in a new section 504(b), which was added by section 4 of the Civil Rights Restoration Act. In general , the term is to be given an institution-wide scope rather than the program- or activity-specific scope called for by Grove City College v. U\u00a7..1.l, 465 U.S. 555 (1984). Grove City was superseded by the Civil Rights Restoration Act. See sec. 2, Pub. L.

The qualification operates in the same way as the qualification Congress enacted in 1978 with respect t o alcohol and drug abuse, on which the contagious disease provision was modeled. see note 19, infra, and accompanying text. Both provis ions are structured as exclusions from the general def ini- tion. The natural implication of both statutory exclusions i s that persons who do not fall within the specified grounds for exclusion are covered by section 504 to the extent that they meet the general requirements of that section. - 4 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 99 of 175( ~~a:id symptomatic HIV-infected individ~als) lre ~ith1n the sec~i on ~idual notwithstanding their contagiousness.

Arline involved an elementary school teacher who had been discharged after suffering a third relapse of tuberculosis withi n two years. All parties conceded, and the court found, that the plaintiff was handicapped because her tuberculosis had adversely lffected her respiratory system, requiring hospitalization. I,g. at 1127-1128. Plaintiff's respiratory ailment thus was a physi- cal impairment that substantially limited one of her major life activities. .Is;l. The Court concluded that the defendant's action came within the coverage of section 504, notwithstanding the fact that Ms. Arline was dismissed not because of any disabling effects of her tuberculosis but because of her employer's fear that her contagiousness threatened the health of her students. The Court concluded that wthe fact that a person with a record of ( hysical impairment is also contagious does not suffice to remove that person from coverage under \u00a7 504. .ls.i\u00b7 at 1130 (emphasis added) . 7 Arline was also concerned with a third element: namely, whether the contagiousness of a handicapped individual covered by the Act could be used as a justification for discrimination against that individual. Subject to the otherwise qualified limitation, the Court: held that contagiousness cannot be used for this purpose. The Court stated: we do not agree with peti- tioners that, in defining a handicapped individual under \u00a7 504, the contagious effects of a disease can be meaningfully distin- guished from the disease's physical effects on a claimant. It would be untair to allow an employer to seize upon the distinction between the effects of a disease on others and the effects of a disease on a patient and use that distinction to justify discriminatory treatment. Arline, 107 s. Ct. at 1128. In light of the Court's holding, we conclude that the contagiousness of an HIV-infected individual cannot be relied upon to remove that individual from the coverage of the Act. contra Cooper Opinion at 27 and n.70. - 5 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 100 of a uch as cancer or ;ne~mc nia has deveLocec, \u00b7nd 1s a result, t~e lndiv:dual i s iiaqncsed ~li~ic~l AIDS. the substanti al lim1 ti~g effects these ~li~ical symptoms have on major life 1ctiv1~ies, such a person is an \" individual with handicapsu for purposes of section 504. This same conclusion shoul d also apply tJ a person with ARC, who tlso has serious disabling pnysical effects caused by HIV infection, although the physical symptoms ~re not the particular diseases that the Cente ~ s for Disease ~o~t.rol have included in its list of the clinical sym~ --ms that ~onstitute AIDS. As w1th the tuberculosis that afflic~~ d Ms. Arline, AIDS (or ARC) is often \"serious enough to require hospitalization, a fact more than sufficient [in itself] to establish that one or more . . major life activities [are) substantially limited . \" I.Q. at 1127. Therefore, assuming they are otherwise qualified, contagiousness does not excuse or justify discrimination against individuals handicapped by syn:ptomatic HIV infection. As will be seen, the consideration of the \"otherwise qualified standard allows for a reasonable determination of whether contagiousness threatens the health or safety of others or job performance, and in those events, permits the exclusion of the individual from the covered program or activity. B. Asymptomatic HIV-Infected Individuals Arline did not resolve the application of section 504 to asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals.8 The Court left open the 8 Since the plaintiff had disabling physical symptoms and thus was clearly a handicapped individual under section 504, the Court declined to reach the question of whether a person without such an impairment could be considered handicapped by virtue of a communicable disease alone. As the Court stated, *(t]his case does not present, and we therefore d~ not reach, the questions whether a carrier of a contagious disease such as AIDS (who suffers no physical impairment] could be considered to have a physical impairment, or whether such a person could be consider- ed, solely on the basis of contagiousness, a handicapped person as defined by the Act. 151. at 1128 n.7. Subsequent to Arline, the surgeon General informed this Off ice that even an asympto- matic HIV-infected individual is physically impaired, stating that \"from a purely scientific perspective, persons with HIV infection are clearly impaired.

Asymptomatic HIV-Infected Individuals Are Physically Irnpaireg ~he Department of Health and Human Services regulations implementing section 504 define Hphysical impairment# as: (A)ny physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense (2) (i} (1987). In addition, an appendix to the regulations provides an illustrative (but not exhaustive) list of diseases and conditions that are #physical impairments# for pur-poses of section 504: #such ~iseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, (and] emotional illness, and . drug addiction and alcoholism.# 45 C.F.R. Pt. 84, App. A, p. 344 (1987). The first question is whether an asymptomatic HIV-infected individual is physically impaired for purposes of section 504. For this factual determination we necessarily must rely heavily on the views of the Public Health Service of the United States. In this respect, Dr. c. Everett Koop, the surgeon General of the Public Health service, has indicated that it is a( continued) individual, such as a Hepatitis B carrier, would be protected by the Act. See note J, suora. ~., Kohl by Kohl v. Woodhaven Learning center, 672 F. Supp. 1226, 1236 (W.D.

The over~helmin g majority of infected persons exhibit detectable abnormal ities of the immune system. Koop Letter at 1-2. On the basis of these facts, the Surgeon General concluded that from a purely scientific perspective, persons with HIV infection are clearly impaired. They are not compar-able to an immune carrier of a contagious disease such as Hepatitis B. Like a person in the early stages of cancer, they may appear outwardly healthy but are in fact seriously ill. I.,g. at 2. In our view, the type of impairment described in the Surgeon General's letter fits the HHS definition of physical impairment because it is ~ physiological disorder or condition affecting the hemic and lymphatic systems. 9 We therefore 9 Moreover, it would also appear that the impairment affects the brain and central nervous system as well. Medical evidence indicates that the AIDS virus, apart from any effect it has on the immune system, also attacks the central nervous system and may result in some form of mental deficiency or brain dysfuncti on i n a significant percentage of persons infected with the virus. Mental disease (dementia) will occur in some patients who have the AIDS virus before they have any other manifestation such as ARC or classic AIDS.

See also ..i\u00a3!. at 12 (\"The AIDS virus may also attack the nervous system and cause delayed damage to th brain. This damage may take years to develop and the symptoms may show up as memory loss, indifference, loss of coordination, partial paralysis, or mental disorder. These symptoms may occur alone, or with other symptoms mentioned earlier.).

L'nder the HHS regulations implementing section 504, \"'major life activities' means functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.N 45 C.F.R. 84.J(j) (2) (ii) (1987) (emphasis added). Although the definition is illustrative and not exhaustive, it does provide a helpful starting point for our analysis. We would expect that courts will resolve the factual question of whether the impairment of HIV infection limits a major life activity by reviewing this list for guidance in ascertaining whether a particular activity constitutes a basic function of life comparable to those on the list. As indicated earlier, the disabling effects of HIV infection are readily apparent in the case of symptomatic HIV infection. The salient point with respect to symptomatic HIV-infected individuals is not that they have AIDS or ARC but rather that their impairment has manifest disabling effects. Again, as noted above, we believe that the courts will find that such individuals are limited in a number of major activities. Due to the weakness of their immune system and depending on the nature of the parti- cular disease afflicting symptomatic HIV-infected individuals, any and perhaps all of the life activities listed in the HHS regulations could be substantially limited. The question with respect to asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals is more difficult because such individuals would not appear at first glance to have disabling physical effects from their infection that substantially aftect the type of life activities listed in the HHS regulations. Their ability, for example, to work, to care for themselves, to perform manual tasks, or to use their senses are usually not directly affected. 9( .. continued) pregnancy. Also bearing on whether HIV infection is a physical impairment under the HHS regulations is the Surgeon General's statement in his letter that HIV infection in its early stages is comparable to cancer --a disease that is listed in the HHS regulations as a physical impairment --in that infected indivi- duals wmay appear outwardly healthy but are in fact seriously ill.w Koop Letter at 2. - 9 - ------~-- ------\u00b7 - -' This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 104 of 175! ~revertheless, we believe it i limits certain major life activi-ties. While the Supreme court explicitly refrained from answer-ing this precise question in Arline, because HIV infection ~as no: before it and perhaps in the mistaken understanding that asymptomatic HIV infection was not accompanied by an inpair-ment, 10 the logic of the decision cannot fairly be said to lead to a different conclusion. This conclusion, we believe, may be based either on the effect that the knowledge of infection will have on the individual or the effect that knowledge of the infection will have on others. With respect to the latter basis, the Court observed, w(i]t would be unfair to allow an employer to seize upon the distinction between the effects of a disease on others and the effects of a disease on a patient and use this distinction to justify discriminatory treatment.w Arline, 107 S. Ct. at 1128. a. Limitation of Life Activities Traceable to Knowledge of Infection by Asymptomatic HIV-Infected Individual Turning first to the effect knowledge of infection may have on the asymptomatic individual, it can certainly be argued that asymptomatic HIV infection does not directly affect any major life activity listed in the HHS regulations. 45 C.F.R. 84.3(j) (2) (ii) (1987). However, since the regulatory list was not intended as an exhaustive one, we believe at least some courts would find a number of other equally important matters to be directly affected. Perhaps the most important such activities are procreation and intimate personal relations. Based on the medical knowledge available to us, we believe that it is reasonable to conclude that the life activity of procreation --the fulfillment of the desire to conceive and bear healthy children --is substantially limited for an asymptomatic HIV-infected individual. In light of the significant risk that the AIDS virus may be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy,ll HIV-infected individuals cannot, whether they are male or female, engage in the act ot procreation with the normal expectation of bringing Corth a healthy child. Because of the infection in their system, they will be unable to fulfill this basic human desire. There is little doubt that procreation is a major life 10 compare Arline, 107 s. Ct. at 1128 n.7 (suggesting that HIV infection is a disease without physical impairment) !!.i.th Koop Letter at 2 (HIV infection is a physical impairment). 11 surgeon General's Report at 20-21 (Approximately one third of the babies born to AIDS-infected mothers will also be infected with the AIDS virus.-). -10 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 105 of 175( ac<:: l v l t1\u00b7 and :h..! t ::i.e once a~ indi v1dual is i nfected the AIDS virus. ~his limitation - -the phys ical inability to bear healthy children --i s apart frarn the fact :hat asymptomatic HIV-inf ected ~~div1duals Nil l choose not to attempt procreation. The secondary decision to forego having children i s just one of ~any major life decisions t hat we assume infected individuals will make differentl y as a result of their awareness of their infection. Similarly , some courts can be expected to find a l imitation of a major l ife activity in the fact that an asymptomatic HIV-infected individual's intimate relations are also likely to be affected by HIV infection. The life activity of engaging in sexual relations is threatened and probabl l substantially limited by the contagiousness of the virus. 2 Finding limitations of life activities on the basis of the asymptomatic individual's responses . to the knowledge of infection might be assailed as not fully \u00b7persuasive since it depends upon the conscience and good sense of the person infected. The causal nexus, i t would be argued, is not between the physical effect of the infection (as specified in the Koop Letter) and life activi- ties, but between the conscience or normative judgment of the particular infected person and life activities. Thus, it might be asserted that there is nothing inherent in the infection which actually prevents either procreation or intimate relations.13 It is undoubtedly true that some HIV-infected individuals have not or will not change their behavior after learning they are infected, thereby exhibiting disregard for the health of their offspring or sexual partners. Nonetheless, in any case where the evidence indicates that the plaintiff HIV-infected individual has in fact changed his or her behavior --as, for example, where the plaintiff represents that procreation has been foregone --the court might well find a limitation of major life activity. Moreover, courts may choose to pass over such factual questions since the Supreme Court has stated an alternative rationale for finding a life activity limitation based on the reaction of others to the infection. We turn to that rationale next. 12 lil\u00b7 at 14-18. 13 As indicated in the text, we think this argument is disingenuous at least insofar as infection physically precludes the normal procreation of healthy children. -11 - :I This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 106 of 175( ~. relied on t~e express terms of the statute for the propositi on chat a handicapped individual includes so~eone who is regarded by others as having a limitation of maJor l i fe activities whe~her they do or not. 2 9 U.S.C. 706f8) (B) (iii). This provision was added by Congress in 1374. The Court cited the legislative history accompanying this textual expansion to show that an i mpaired person could be protected even if the impairment \"in fact does not substantially Limit that person's functioning,\" s. Rep. No. 1297, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 64 ( 197 4) , and observed that such an impairment ''could nevertheless substanti ally limit that person's ability to work as a result of the negati \u00b7.,1e reactions of others to the impairment.\" 107 S. Ct. at 1129. This construction by the Court of the statutory definition of the term \"handicapped individual\" has particular significance for the application of section 504 to asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals. The court found that in order \"[t]o combat the effects of erroneous but nevertheless prevalent perceptions about the handicapped,\" j.g. at 1126, Congress intended by its 1974 amendment to expand the section's scope to include persons who are regarded as handicapped, but who may at present have no actual incapacity at all. ~-at 1126-1127 (quoting southeast-ern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 405-406 n.6 (1979)). Stressing this point, the Court repeated later in the opinion that the amended definition covers persons \"who, as a result (of being incorrectly regarded as handicapped], are substantially limited in a major life activity. I.fl. at 1129. The effect of this interpretation is that the perceived impair-ment need not directly result in a limitation of a major life activity, so long as it has the indirect effect, due to the misperceptions of others, of limiting a life activity (in Arline, the activity of working) .14 Thus, at least one district court 14 The Arline court appears not to accept the distinction between being perceived as having an impairment that itself limits a major life activity (the literal meaning of the statutory language) and having a condition the misperception of which results in limitation of a life activity. This may have been the distinction the Solicitor General was attempting to draw by suggesting there was a difference between being perceived as having a handicap that precludes work and being perceived as contagious, which does not physically preclude work, except that because of the perception, no work is offered.

In the context of t he employment of a person handicapped with a contagi ous disease .. this inquiry should include w[findings of] facts, based on reasonab l e medical judgments given the state of ~edical knowled~e, about (a) the nature of the risk (how the disease is transmitted) , (b) the duration of the risk (how long is the carrier infectious), (c) the severity of the risk (what is the potenti al harm to third parties) and (d) the probabilities the disease ~ill be transmitted and will cause varying degrees of harm.w (Quoting Brief for American Medical Associati on as Amicus curiae 19.) In making these findings, courts normally should defer to the reasonable medical judg- ments of public health officials. The next step in the wotherwise-qualif ied inquiry is for the court to evaluate, in light of these medical findings, whether the employer could reasonably accommodate the employee under the established standards for that inquiry . .I,g. at 1131 (footnotes omitted) . It is important to emphasize that the Court recognized that w[a] person who poses a significant risk of communicatin g an infectious disease to others in the workplace will not be other- ~ise qualified for his or her job i f reasonable accommodation will not eliminate that risk. ~-at 1131 n.16. The Court has thus made it clear that persons infected with the AIDS virus will not be otherwise quali!ied to perform jobs that involve a significant risk of transmitting the virus to others. In addition, an otherwise qualified person is one who is able to meet all of a program's requirements in spite of his handicap. southea!i'rD Community College v. Davis, 442 u.s. 397, 406 (1979). 16 In ascertaining whether a person is otherwise qualified, the court considers whether any 'reasonable accommodation' by the employer would enable the handicapped person to perform those functions.

In addition, current medical knowledge does suggest the possibility of specialized contexts where, even with respect to a person in the early stages of the Jisease, a court might find an individual to be not otherwise qualified. These situations are very likely to involve individuals who have responsibility for health or safety, such as health care professionals or air traffic controllers. In these and similar situations where there is a greater possibility that the AIDS virus could be transmitted (see generally, Surgeon General's Reoort), or the consequences of a dementia attack could be especially dangerous (see note 9, supra), we believe a court could find, within the scope of #otherwise qualified standard, a justification for treating HIV- infected individuals differently from uninfected individuals. In brief, ~hether HIV-infected individuals will be found after the individualized inquiry required by Arline to be otherwise qualified will often depend on how far the disease has progressed. At the early stages of the disease, it is likely that neither health and safety nor performance will provide a justification for excluding an HIV-infected person. Moreover, while current medical knowledge suggests that safety should not be a concern in most contexts even as the disease progresses, an individualized assessment of performance may result in those with AIDS or ARC being found not otherwise qualified. Finally, courts may find in certain specialized contexts that an HIV-infected individual is not otherwise qualified at any stage of the disease because infection in itself presents an especially serious health or safety risk to others because of the nature of 16( .. continued) nature of (the] program.' 107 s.

Apolication of Section 504 iD the Emplovment Context A. Introducti on and Summary . . Civil Rights ~dcc or~~ion Act included a provision, the Harkin-Humphrey amendment,18 which amended the definit ions section of the Rehabilitation Act t o provide, ~ith respect to employment, a specific qualification of the definit ion of an \"individual with handicaps\" in the context of contagious diseases and infections: For the purpose of sections 503 and 504, as such sections relate to employment, [the term windiv idual with handicaps-] does not include an individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such disease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individ- uals or who, by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection, is unabl e to perform the duties of the job. As discussed below, application of the Harkin-Humphrey amendment in the employment context should result in substantially the same conclusions as result from application in the non-employment context of section 504 as interpreted in Arline. Specifically, we conclude that Harkin-Humphrey provides that HIV-infected individuals (regardless of whether or not they are symptomatic) are protected against discrimination in the employment context so long as they fall within the general section 504 requirements defining an -individual with handicaps and do not contravene the specific qualification t o the general requirements that the amendment provides: namely, that they do not -constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals and they can -perform the duties of the job. In our judgment, this qualification merely codifies the otherwise qualified standard discussed by the Court in Arline and discussed above in this memorandum, including the provision of a means of reasonable accommodation that can eliminate the health or safety threat or enable the employee to perform the duties of the job, if it is provided for under the employer's existing personnel policies and does not impose an undue financial or administrative burden. 18 Pub. L. No. 100-259, sec. 9, 102 Stat. 28, 31-32 (1988). Since this amendment to section 504 was jointly sponsored by senators Harkin and Humphrey, we will refer to the amendment in this opinion as Harkin-Humphrey.- -16 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 111 of 175( ( Because Harkin-Humphrey ~~s ~ floor ~~endme conun:ttee , L~ere is explara tary s~atement that accompan its of pu~pcse --\"Purpose: To pro\u00b7.r Jan. 28, 1988) --and d brief colloqu y between t he two sponsors. Id. at 5256-257. The sponsors' colloquy made three basic points. First, the amendment was designed to do in the contagious disease and infection context what the comparably phrased 1978 amendment to section 504 did i n the context of alcohol and drug abusel9 --\"assure employers that: they are not required to retain or hire individuals with a contagious disease or infection when such individuals pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals, or cannot perform the essential duties of a JOb.w Isl\u00b7 at S256-57.

Finally, \"as we stated in 1978 with respect to alcohol and drug abusers, . the two-step process in section 504 applies in the situation under which it was first determined that a person was handicapped and then it is determined that a person is otherwise qualified.w lit\u00b7 With that description of Harkin-Humphrey's principal legislative history as background, we now discuss the amendment's impact on two aspects of the application of section 504 to HIV infection cases in the employment context: {l) whether section 504 applies to both asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected individuals; and (2) the manner in which the section's wotherwise qualified requirement is to be applied, including whether employers must provide wreasonable accommodation to infected individuals. B. Coveraae of All HIV-Infected Individuals (Subject to the Stated Limitations) We have no difficulty concluding that the Harkin-Humphrey amendment, and thus section 504 in the employment context, 19 por purposes of sections 503 and 504 as such sections relate to employment, [the term handicapped individualJ does not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question or whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others.w Pub.

Nevertheless, we be lieve t he natural Lmpl.ication of this s t at utory e xclusion i s t hat persons who do not fal l within the specified grounds for exclusion are covered b y section 504 to the extent that they meet the general require ments of that section. According ly, i n light of cur previous discuss ion of the applj.cation of the genera l provisions of section 504 to HIV-infected persons , we conclude that al l HIV-infected individuals who are not a direct threat to the health or safety of others and a r e able to perform the duties of thei r job are covered by section 504. ~arkin-Humphrey's le~islative history reinforces this reading of the amendmen t . O There was no disagreement expressed concerning the amendment's applicability to asymptomatic HIV- infected individuals, and a number of legislators expressly stated that such persons were covered. Senator Harkin described the purpose of the amendment i n a letter, dated February 26, 1988, to Representatives Hawkins and Edwards. Senator Harkin explained that (t]he objective of the amendment is to expressly state in the statute the current standards of section 504 so as to reassure employers that they are ~ required t o hire or retain individuals with contagious diseases or infections who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others or who cannot perform the duties of a job. The basic manner in which an individual with a contagious disease or infection can present a direct threat to the health or safety ot others is when the individual poses a significant risk of transmitting the contagious disease or infection to other individuals. The Supreme Court in Arline explicitly recognized this necessary limitation in the protections of section 504. The amendment is consistent with this standard. 20 Moreover, the model for the Harkin-Humphrey amendment -- the 1978 amendment to section 504 concerning drug addicts and alcoholics --was intended to include within section 504 those covered persons not possessing the deficiencies identified in the statute.

This clarity is particularly important with regard to infections because individuals who are suffering from a contagious infection --such as carriers of the AIDS virus or carriers of the hepatitis B virus --can also be discriminated against on the basis of their infection and are also individuals with handicaps under the statute. 134 Cong. Rec. H573 (daily ed. Mar. 2, 1988).

This parallels our conclusions with respect to HIV-infecte d individuals, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, outside the employment context. The difference between the employment and non-employment contexts because of the Harkin-Humphrey amendment is thus more apparent than real. Specifically, i t is our view that the Harkin-~umphrey amendment merely collapses the \"otherwise qualified\" inquiry applicable outside the employment context into the definition of \"individual with handicaps\" in the employment text. Thus, whether outside the employment context a particular infected person is deemed to be handicapped but ultimately receives no protection under the statute because that person poses a danger to others and is thereby not wotherwise qualified\" or whether that same person is not deemed to be handicapped under the Harkin-Humphrey amendment in the employment context for the same reason is of only semantic significance. In either case, if the infection is a direct threat to the health or safety of others or renders the individual unable to perform the duties of the job, the grantee or employer is not required to include that person in the covered program or activity or retain or hire him in a job. Indeed, the legislative history suggests that the principal purpose of the Harkin-Humphrey amendment was the codification of the wotherwise qualified limitation as discussed in Arline.23 22 See, ~' 134 Cong.

The legislative history of the Harkin-Humphrey amendment indicates that Congress was quite aware that administrative and judicial interpretation had added the \"reasonable accommodation\" gloss to section 504, and Congress understood and intended that such a gloss would be put on Harkin-Humphrey. The first evidence of t~is is found in the colloquy between Senators Harkin and Humphrey upon the introduction of the amendment. The colloquy stressed that the amendment \"does nothing to change the current laws regarding reasonable accommodation as it applies to individuals with handicaps.* 134 Cong. Rec. 5257 (daily ed. Jan. 28, 1988). More expansively, Senator Harkin subsequently stated that the amendment does nothing to change the requirements in the regulations regarding providing reasonable accommodations for persons with handicaps, as such provisions apply to persons with contagious diseases and infections. Thus, if a reasonable accommodation would eliminate the existence of a direct threat to the health or safety of others or eliminate the inability of an individual with a contagious disease or infection to perform the essential duties of a job, the individual is qualified to remain in his or her position. 134 Cong. Rec. Sl740 (daily ed. Mar. 2, 1988). Senator Harkin's statement cannot be given dispositive weight because it was not joined by his co-sponsor, Senator Humphrey, and it was not made before the Senate voted on the amendment. However, Senator Humphrey never directly challenged this statement, or said that reasonable accommodation was not intended, and unchallenged statements to the same effect were made by members of the House speaking in favor of and against the amendment prior to the House vote on the amendment and by members of the Senate speaking in favor of and against the amendment -22 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 117 of 175( ( ~r:or t o the 1ote t Represen tative ~eiss remarked that ~ontagious diseases or infec~ions ] are also not otherwise qualified if, without reasonable accommodatio n , they would pose a direct t~reat to the health or safety of others or could not perform the essential func~ions of a job.

As noted by the Court, the HHS regulations provide that H[e)mployers have an affirmative obligation to make a reasonable accommodation for a handicapped employee. Although they are not required to find another job for an employee who is not qualified for the job he or she was doing, they cannot deny an employee alternative employment opportunities reasonably available under the employer's existing policies.N 107 s. Ct. at 1131 n.19. However, \"where reasonable accommodation does not overcome the effects of a person's handicap, or where reasonable accommodation causes undue hardship t o the employer, failure to hire or promote the handicapped person will not be considered discrimination . 45 C.F.R., Part 84, App. A., p. 350 (1987). While reasonable accommodation _ is part of the individualized factual inquiry and therefore difficult to discuss in the abstract, it clearly does not require allowing an HIV-infected individual to continue in a position where the infection poses a threat to others. This would appear to be the case with infected health care workers who are involved in invasive surgical proce- dures, and it may also be the case with respect to other infected health care workers or individuals employed in jobs that entail responsibility for the safety of others. Limited accommodations might be required if alternative employment is reasonably avail- able under the employer's existing policies. For example, a surgeon in a teaching hospital might be restricted to teaching or other medical duties that do not involve participation in invasive surgical procedures, or a policeman might be reassigned to duties that do not involve a significant risk of a physical injury that would involve bloodshed. In contrast, given the evolving and uncertain state of knowledge concerning the effects of the AIDS virus on the central nervous system, it may not be possible, at least if the disease has sufficiently progressed, to make reasonable accommodation for positions, such as bus driver, airline pilot, or air traffic controller, that may allow very little flexibility in possible job assignment and where the risk of injury is great if the employer guesses wrongly and the infected person is not able to perform the duties of the job. -28 - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 123 of 175( ( Conclus :..Q.D protects symptomatic and asy:npto~atic HIV-~nfected individuals against discrimination in any covered ~~og~am or activity on the basis of any actual, past or perceived effect ot HIV infection that substantially limits any major life act:vity --so lonq as the HIV-infected individual is notherwise quali:iedn participate in the p=ogram or activity, as deter- ~1ne d under the nother~ise qualifiedw standard set forth in Arline.

These concerns ~111 8 e greatly affected by the extent to which HIV infected tndiv1duals understand themselves to be protected from dis-~r im1nation on account of their infection. ?rotection of persons with HIV infection from discrimination ts an extremely critical puolic healt h necessity because of our ~imited tools in the fight against AIDS. At this timer we have no vaccine to protect against HIV infection and only one treatment which appears to extend the lives of some persons with AIDS but does not cure the disease. Consequently, the primary public health strategy is prevention of HIV trans- m1ss1on. This strategy requires extensive counseling and testing for HIV 1nfection. If counseling and testing are to work most effectively, individuals ~ust have confidence that they ~111 be protected fully from HIV related discrimination. Juring our meeting you and members of your staff raised a number of perceptive questions concerning the nature of HIV :nfection including the pathogenesis of the virus and its ~odes of transmission. Your interest in the scientific aspects of HIV infection is welcome, since it is our belief that any leqal o~inion regarding HIV infection should accurately reflect acientif ic reality. As I sought to emphasize during our meeting, much has been learned about HIV infection tbat makes it inappropriate to think of it as composed of d!acrete conditions such as ARC or full blown AIDS.

FINANCE AND URBAN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY From: Bill Mccollum 1507 LONGWORTH HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING WASHINGTON DC 20515 1202) 225-2176 DISTRICT OFFICE: , Fl 32789 (407) 645-3100 FROM LAKE COUNTY , TOll FREE : 383-8541 Re: A brief analysis of the Senate Committee draft report on the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989. The following is a synopsis of some of the critical issues of concern regarding the Senate report on the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989. DEFINITION Under the report covering the ADA definition of disability, the term disability is held to include drug addiction and alcoholism. This could be a source of confusion as the bill states that an individual suffering from these conditions may still be held to the qualification standards of other employees. On a more positive note, the report states that companies are not obliged to provide drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs under the ADA as part of making \"reasonable accommodation,\" although companies are encouraged to do so. Further, the report states that homosexuality is not to be considered a disability, thereby implying, though not explicitly stating, that other such sexual orientations -pedophilia -are not protected. Another problem with the report language dealing with the definition of disability is that it is not clear whether voluntary conditions, i.e. obesity from overeating, would be covered under this bill. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 127 of 175EMPLOYMENT Under the language dealing with employment, the phrase \"essential functions\" of the job remains undefined, beyond a statement saying that the tasks are \"fundamental and not marginal.\" It is not clear what that means, nor is it clear who will decide what functions are essential. The employer, the employee, the courts? This needs to be clarified. The report also states that the determination of when an individual with a disability represents a \"direct threat\" to the workplace must be determined on a case by case basis. Who will make such a determination? The report goes on to say that the \"employer must identify specific behavior on the part of an individual with a disability that would constitute an anticipated direct threat.\" Taken together with the bill, it is not clear if the employer need anticipate a direct threat or that a direct threat must be present. Furthermore, the report states that the employer must demonstrate that the \"person poses a significant risk to the safety of others or to property\". A \"significant risk\" criterion is not the same as \"direct threat\" criterion. Which one is to apply? Do they mean the same thing in the context of this bill? This needs to be clarified. Additionally the report adds that an employer may not deny employment on the basis of his fears about the safety of the employee or higher rates of absenteeism. This would seem to contradict the \"significant risk\" language of the report and should be clarified. The report includes the following: \"The Committee wishes to make it clear that non-job related personal use items such as hearing aids and eyeglasses are not included in this provision.\" The use of the double negative in this statement is peculiar and should be clarified. The report states that employers are obligated to make \"reasonable accommodation\" only for the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified individual. Therefore the obligation to accommodate would be triggered by a request on the part of the employee. However, the report then states that if an employee with a known disability is having difficulty on the job it would be \"appropriate\" for the employer to discuss accommodation with the employee. It is not clear if the employer is obligated to do so. Further, it seems that there is a possible \"catch 2211 situation for the employer since, under the bill, he is not permitted to inquire about disabilities. Finally, the report states that when an employer has two equally well qualified applicants for a job, but one of them has a This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 128 of 175disability, the employer is obliged to hire the individual with the disability. This does not take account of more subjective qualifications such as personality which may be important in determining eligibility for the job. If it is supposed to, this part of the report needs to be clarified. If not, this part of the bill is overly restrictive. One last note: The report language on the defenses under this part of the bill needs to be clarified to make explicit the employers power to limit illegal drug use during non-working hours. Also, the report in this section re-incorporates \"anticipatory discrimination\" language back into the bill, stating that such that the right to pursue litigation on that basis is available under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It is not clear, however, that the Supreme Court case cited for this interpretation of the civil Rights Act is applicable in cases involving disabilities. This needs to be more closely studied. Furthermore, an explanation of how anticipatory discrimination language would work in an employment context should be provided. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 129 of 175Public Accommodation by Private Entities The report states that restaurant and theater owners may not oblige individuals in wheelchairs to be chaperoned as this would impose \"additional requirements\" on the individual with a disability. However, the report does not make it clear whether or not the terms of the ADA would be violated if a theater owner compelled persons in wheelchairs to sit close to fire exits for safety reasons. The report states that entities need not make modifications that would \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of privileges, advantages and accommodations. The term \"fundamentally alter\" is never defined. The report states that \" filmmakers are encouraged to produce and distribute open captioned versions of films and theaters should have at least some pre-announced screenings of a captioned version of feature films.\" The \"should\" language suggests that theaters are obliged to offer such screenings, which would seem to be an \"undue burden,\" while the \"encouraged\" language that precedes it seems to suggest that such presentations are optional. The report needs to clarify this problem. The term \"readily achievable\" is used to define those circumstances in which a reasonable accommodation is obligatory. In other words only those reasonable accommodations that are \"readily achievable\" must be made. However, the report language then states that the \"readily achievable standard only requires physical access that can be achieved without extensive restructuring or burdensome expense.\" This definition is far too broad and suggests that any cost short of bankruptcy is permissible. The report uses the term \"potential places of employment\" in describing a place of public accommodation. However, unlike the bill, the report limits this only to new construction. This needs to be clarified. The report states that if it is structurally impracticable to achieve full compliance with accessibility requirements under the ADA, other accommodations still should be made. It is not clear why an employer, if he cannot widen the door frames in his office to accommodate individuals in wheelchairs, must still make other accommodations that such individuals will not be able to get inside to use in any case. Again, the report inserts back into the bill the right to sue if an individual believes that he or she is about to be discriminated against in contexts other than that of injunctive relief for new construction. This was to have been corrected under the Senate mark-up of the ADA. This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 130 of 1751 Finally, the report fails to allow that money damages be granted only when discrimination has been determined to be willful and egregious. This should be corrected so that injunctive relief is made available but money damages are confined to specific circumstances. * This report is designed only to cover some of the highlights of the Senate Committee report on the Americans with Disabilities Act in the areas of definitions, employment, and public accommodation by private entities.

TROWBRIDGE President Honorable Bill Mccollum U.S. House of Representatives 1507 LHOB Washington, DC 20515 Dear Mr. Mccollum: .. 07 Ei July 5, 1989 The National Association of Manufacturers supports many of the concepts underlying H.R. 2273, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but strongly opposes the legislation as introduced May 9. As a result, NAM and others are actively involved in discussions with representatives of the disability community to fashion legislation that all can embrace. On the basis of policy adopted by our board of directors, NAM joins the Administration and sponsors of H.R. 2273 in seeking to eliminate discrimination against those with disabilities. We recognize there are gaps in current law and, as a matter of equity, the protections afforded to other protected groups should be extended to the disabled. As.a matter of economic reality -demo- graphic trends and shrinking labor markets -barriers that limit their full participation in mainstream American life also deny the nation the valuable con- tributions their talents can offer. The ADA, however, is not a simple extension of current civil rights law but a complex set of requirements lifted from various statutes and regt!lations that are sometimes undefined, frequently ambiguous and, in some instances, in conflict with other requirements, ~, for drug-free workplaces. The nrultiple remedies provided, including direct access to jury trials and punitive and co~ pensatory damages, are in excess of those afforded to other protected classes. This would appear to encourage increased litigation rather than conciliation. Employers and providers of services would face numerous uncertainties in at- tempts to accommodate the disabled and be liable not only for alleged acts of discrimination, but ulso fer anticipated discrimination -whether or not inten- tional. NAM and a coalition of associations and companies will continue to work with Congressional leadership , the Administration and representatives of the disability community. our objective is meaningful, workable legislation that responds to the legitimate needs of the disabled without imposing unreasonable burdens on the economy. NAM is committed to that end. However, absent some accorranodation to our concerns, particularly concerning remedies, we are equally committed to seeking defeat of H.R. 2273. That is not a course of action we would relish, but as currently drafted, the bill is totally unacceptable. 1331 Pennayh1anla Avenue, NW Suite 1500 North lobby Washington, DC 20004-1703 (202) 637-3012 FAX: (202) 637-3182 Sincerely, This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 153 of 175The Access 2000 Proposal Among the options and alternatives available to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989 (ADA, S.933) is a proposal currently being drafted by Representative Bill Mccollum (R-FL5) called Access 2000. This proposal would, in effect, allow the grassroots business groups and organizations representing individuals with disabilities to directly affect the nature and composition of \"reasonable accommodation\" regulations on a state by state basis. In so doing this proposal would effectively cut out of the process those groups that have no direct vested interest in disabilities rights legislation, groups that have, in fact, become intimately involved in the drafting of the ADA. Under Access 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be directed to draw up guidelines for the states to follow in creating their own \"reasonable accommodation\" regulations. After the gudelines are published, each state would be expected to submit to HHS its own proposed regulations, implemen t ation of which would have to be accomplished by the year 2000 at the latest. States that fail to submit a plan for approval, or that submit a plan that does not meet HHS guidelines, would have certain Federal funds witheld untill such time as an accepta ble plan has been submitted. After that, each state would be held responsible for implementing their plan, and f or assuring that such a plan is in fact implement ed by t he year 2000. Needless to say, this plan not only allows interested groups t o participate almost directly in the drafting and implementatio n process, but it also allows t he states to draft regulations that meet the specific needs of their disabl ed communities in ways that would be the least costly to their business communities .

Discussions have been held with representatives of the disability community. Congress and the Administration in an effort to fashion legislation we can all embrace. However. unless changes are made, particularly in the area of rem- edies. the Group will seek to defeat S. 933/H.R. 2273. CONCERNS WITH LEGISLATION Listed below are summaries highlighting some of the Group's concerns with the ADA. all of which have been communicated to the parties. There are two levels of concern with the legislation: first. the issues relating to enforcement and remedies: and second. all others. We have made it clear that resolution of the former is absolutely essential to further negotiation. without which the Group will seek defeat of the bills. That should not. however. be interpreted to mean that resolving the threshold concerns alone would be acceptable. THRESHOLD ISSUES Enforcmtmt!Rnn1dies. In addition to the remedies. administrative procedures and defenses available under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 --for which there is an extensive body of law and successful ex- perience regarding cases alleging discrimination based on race. sex. religion and national origin --the ADA. in \u00a7205. provides a second. separate track of enforcement that would permit a jury trial. and punitive and compensatory damages. i.e .. pain and suffering. The second track must eliminated. Anticipatory Discrimination. Section 205 of the ADA would also provide relief to individuals who believe they \"are about to be\" discriminated against. Such speculative complaints and attendant litigation are not per- mitted in any other civil rights in employment legislation and should be eliminated from the ADA. GENERIC ISSUES Enforcnnmt Duplication/Consisrmcy with Rehabilitation Act. A significant number of employers are currently subject to Sections 503 and/or 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 3' amended. that prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities. The ADA would impose additional. in some cases. conflicting obligations on these employers. The ADA is silent as to situations where employers are faced with inconsistent standards and duplicative enforcement by various federal agencies . Compliance with Section 503 or 504 standards should be deemed to be in compliance with the ADA. Failure wrnts Rqitsol to Act. The lack of distinction between intentional and unintentional discrimination will penalize employers for inadvertent errors in their attempts to abide by new. affirmative obligations imposed by the ADA. Discrimination should be defined as \"refusal\" or \"willful failure\" to act. R~ONJble Accommodation and Undue Burdnt. As defined in \u00a7I. there is no limitation on the lengths to which one must go to provide reasonable accommodation. though it is limited in \u00a7I 0 I (b) (Defenses) as not requiring an \"undue burden.\" which itself is undefined . In the absence of the definition. docs this connote that \"undue burden\" means anything that threatens a firm's e~istence? Further. under \u00a7202(b)(2). it would be discriminatory not to hire an individual on rhe basis of the need for reasonable accommodation. not limited in this conre~t by a defense of .. undue burden ... Thus. an employer could not offer the defense of undue burden in response to an allegation of refusal of hire because on the need for reasonable accommodation . In order This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 155 of 175.-\u00b7 that employers and others understand the bounds of their obligations. reasonable accommodation should be defined not to require fundamental alterations or result in undue financial or administrative burdens and include a definition of \"undue burden.\" Codification of relevant Section 504 regulations and additional information regarding obligations would provide needed guidance. Incmrives. While it is argued that. as a civil rights law. the costs attendant to compliance with the ADA are irrelevant. no other civil rights statute requires a private employer. who is not a federal contractor or grantee, to expend substantial resources on affirmatively accommodating a protected class. In some instances, the costs will be significant and burdensome, particularly on smaller businesses. As introduced, the ADA contains no incentive to encourage and assist employers to make expenditures to increase opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The tax deduction of $35,000/year permitted under \u00a7 190 of the Internal Revenue Code for removal of achitectural barriers should be increased and expanded to defray the costs incurred in providing reasonable accommodation or auxiliary aids and services that would be required by the ADA. TITLE I -GENERAL PROHIBmONS Drug/Alcohol Abuse. The bill, in \u00a7l0l(b)(2)(A), appears to limit an employer's ability to adopt and imple- ment a drug-free workplace policy by protecting current abusers of alcohol/illegal substances except where it can be demonstrated that such use consitutes a direct threat to property and/or safety. In view of federal and Congressional policy on drug-free workplaces. this provision should be revised to eliminate current con- tradictions. to clarify that nothing in the ADA is intended to protect current abusers, and to protect the right of employers to implement \"zero-tolerance\" policies concerning substance abuse . Overlap Berwem Titles I and n. It is unclear what additional burdens are imposed on employers in Title I which are not included in Title II which governs the employment relationship. As currently constructed. drafters of the ADA have lifted regulations implementing Section 504 (which are targeted to federal grant recpients) and simply added the term \"job\" so that they now would apply to employment. In doing so. new, broad and ambiguous terms are used that have no historical interpretation. When. for example, is one job considered \"as effective as\" another? The term \"job\" should be deleted wherever it appears in Title I and it should be made clear that employment discrimination is controlled exclusively by Title II. Discrimination /Ty Assistance. The ADA would hold an employer or other entity liable if the recipient of its charity or assistance discriminates on the basis of disability. whether or not there is knowledge of such discrimination . Section I 0 I (a)( I )(E) should be amended to reflect that such act is illegal only where the provider knows of the discrimination. Discrimination Based on Association. The ADA would make it illegal to discriminate against an individual because of the \"relationship to. or association of. that individual or entity with another individual with a disability ... This is unparalled in civil rights law and will invite frivolous lawsuits requiring employers to prove a negative. i.e .. that they weren\"t aware of the associaiton. Section IOl(a)(5) should be deleted. Discrimination in Bmefits. As drafted. Title I creates incredible new liabilities for employers if they provide disabled persons with a benefit which is \"less effective than\" or \"is different or separate\" from that provided to others (e.g . \u00a7!Ol(a)(l)(C) & (D)). Group health insurance benefits. which are offered under the same terms and conditions to all employees. may still be \"less effective\" or \"separate or different\" for a ~rson with disabilities . Employers should only be obligated to offer the same benefits package to all employees. whether or not they are disabled. To require otherwise. e.g . provide specific medical coverage or purchase medical insurance with pre-existing condition waivers. would be prohibitively expensive and result in insurance companies being unable to provide and/or underwrite group health policies. Good Faith Effons. Despite their good faith efforts. employers will be placed in a \"Catch 22\" pos1t1on by the conflicting requirements of \u00a7I 0 l (a)( I )(d) --provide \"different or separate\" programs/activities that are [those] provided to others\u00b7\u00b7 --and \u00a7 l 0 I (a)()) --a disabled person \"shall not be denied the opportunity to participate in such programs or activities that are not separate or different.\" There should be recognition in the ADA of employer good faith efforts to make accommodations to those with disabilities . It is a well recognized concept undc:r current civil rights law and should be incorporated in the ADA. -2 -) . ' , This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 156 of 175Consistmcy with Existing Law. Section 101(a)(4) seems to adopt the adverse impact theory for proving dis- crimination against persons with disabilities. It is not clear whether the authors intend to follow or over- turn Ale:candu v. Choate as it relates to application of the adverse impact theory of discrimination. The Committee Report should indicate the intent of authors to follow Choate, in which Supreme Court Justice Marshall discussed the appropriate application of adverse impact theory. Defmses. The inclusion in Title I of defenses would seem to limit the defenses that would otherwise be available under the Act. There is a adequate body of law under the Civil Rights and Rehabilitation Acts concerning the defenses available to an employer in cases of discrimination and \u00a710l(b)(l) should be deleted. Title II should be amended to provide that the defenses, as well as the procedures and remedies, of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply in actions brought under the ADA. TITLE II -EMPLOYMENT C~rage. The ADA imposes substantial new burdens on employers, particularly for smaller employers. Coverage under Title II should be phased-in, as it was with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, over a five-year period with the threshold starting at 100 employees the first year and dropping each year. This same approach should be employed with regard to Title IV to provide a reasonable time to make changes to physical and procedural barriers. Discrimination. The definition of discrimination in \u00a7202(a) is inconsistent with that in Section 504. To conform the ADA. an employment action is not discriminatory against an \"otherwise\" qualified individual unless it is \"solely\" based on an individual's disability. The term \"solely\" appears in Section 504 itself. Its absence in the ADA will be interpreted by the courts as a deliberate change in the law. Job Applications. Section 202(a) uses a new term. \"job application procedures,\" which differs from the language found in regulations issued under Section 504 concerning the application process. \"processing appli- cations for employment.\" Absent some specific reason for changing the language of Section 504 regulations, this raises questions about whether it will require something other than the Rehabilitation Act. This is particularly important because under Section 503. employers are required to follow certain procedures that permit an applicant with a disability to identify themself to the employer and to discuss the possible need for an accommodation . The new wording suggests that the ADA might prohibit or limit these same procedures. Selection Criteria. Section 202(b) goes beyond Section 504 regulations by limiting an employer 's use of qualification standards. tests, etc .. that \"identify\" individuals with disabilities. such as physicals. even if the identification doesn't lead to an adverse employment decision. The word \"identify\" must be deleted. Use eJtisting Section 504 language to permit use of selection criteria but insure that the criteria don't discriminate against individuals solely on the basis of their disability unless lhe criteria arc job-related. Notice. Section 203 requires notices to be \"posted.\" This is somewhat problematic, for example, for a vision impaired person. The requirement that notice be provided in accessible formats would allow flexibility to use the best means available. TITLE IV -PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS AND SERVICES OPERATED BY PRIVATE ENTERPRISES Public Accommodations. As defined in \u00a7401(1)(A)(II), a public accommodation includes \"potential places of employment .\u00b7\u00b7 Since there is no limitation based on employment size in Title IV. the definition would extend almost universal coverage to the requirement of accessibility . As with Title II. the scope should be phased- in consistent with the scope of the Civil Rights Act and the ADA as introduced in the IOOth Congress. Readily Achievable. Section 402(b)(4)(A) & (8) introduces a new and undefined term not found in existing law, \"readily achievable.\" A definition of readily achievable should be added to \u00a7401. Retroftrring E.tisring Structures. Under \u00a7402(b)(5). there is no threshold as to when an existing structure must be retrofi\"ed. a process \u00b7-limited only by structural impractabiliry \u00b7-that is prohibitively e:\\pcnsive - J - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 158 of 175'\u00b7 - --_ .. --. -_. - July 5, 1989 TO: FROM: ABI Human Rights and Employment Practices Committee D. G. Hauser ~ United States Representative Bill Mccollum (R-Florida) has called our attention to S.933/HR 2273, the\u00b7 so called Americans with Disabilities Act of 1909. United States Senator Tom Harkin (0- Iowa) and Congressman Tony Coehlo have \u00b7introduced the bills in their respective chambers. On the reverse side is a May 23 one-page summary of the major problems Congressmen Mccollum sees with this proposal (I can provide you with a copy of this 30-page bill if desired). After review of the major problem summary, I think you will agree there is cause for alarm. Among some of those causes for alarm is the possibility that the ADA actually would encourage individuals to pursue litigation. A number of the enforcement provisions of the bill, combined with the fact that the ADA's Title II dealing with employment permits an individual to bypass standard EEOC administrative procedures and go straight to litigation, could be overly harsh and might be an incentive to some individuals to pursue frivolous court action. These sections need reworking. If you agree that this proposal would be damaging, perhaps you might wish to initiate a letter to Senator Harkin raising those concerns that you might have about the proposal. Since Congressmen Bill Mccollum is attempting to moderate the proposal, you also might wish to communicate with him expressing your concerns. Senator Harkin's address is United States Senate, Washington DC, 20510. Representative McCollwn's address is 1507 Longworth HOB, Washington, DC, 20515. \u00b7 Call me if you have questions.

Cohen Delegate Robert E. Harris Staff: Executive Director Richard K. Taube Honorable Bill Mccollum U.S. House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Representative McCollum: ' The Americans With Disabilities Act has been introduced by Senator Harkin and former Representative Coelho (S 933/HR 2273). The Act has many admirable objectives, including increased independence for persons who are mobility-impaired. While the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission (NVTC) supports these worthwhile objectives, we wish to alert you to some of the problems with the existing bills. NVTC, together with its neighbor, the Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission (PRTC), is working to implement commuter rail service. While we have been forced to seek legislation to resolve Conrail's concern for indenmification before our service can begin, we are actively preparing to order rolling stock. Our parking lots and platforms will all be accessible to persons in wheelchairs. We have investigated available wheelchair lift technology for access to our trains and found a lift that would seem to meet our needs and those of our mobility-impaired passengers. The lift is portable but sturdy, and can be operated by one crew member. It is easily moved along the platform to provide access to each car. One lift would serve each station. The Americans With Disabiliti es Act, however, would mandate that each new railcar we purchase be accessible, which apparently means that lifts must be attached to each coach. Since this would be a prohibitively expensive prospect, we may be forced to restrict our railcar bidding to those firms able to offer level boarding for wheelchair passengers. At present, we believe only one manufacturer has this capability. Consequentl y, we might not be able to rely on competition to produce a reasonable price for our railcars. Further, concern for clearance of these accessible coaches may force us to undertake expensive tunnel and signal improvements. ' !

Th~t is why NVTC s~pports local option for providing accessibility. We insist that our stations trains be accessible. \u00b7 But, we wish to provide acces~ibility in an' efficient manner that. is fair to all ;taxpayers, .\u00b7 including persons witli disabilities. \u00b7 We' ~ould appreciate 'your careful .consideration of consequences of certain port ions of the Amer_ic;=ans With \u00b7 \u00b7 Thank you ,for the opportunity to\u00b7 connnent .. ., This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 162 of 175t ' / DISABILITY RIGHTS \u00b7WORKING GROUP Issue Paper #2 \u00b7 . -. ~'\" ' .. ~ ENFORCEMENT PROCESS .; ,f\"i ;:~\u00b7 ........ . The enforcement provision in the proposed ADA has been the subject of much criticism because of the\".::rfi\u00b7-\u00b7 manner in which claims of discrimination would be resolved. The focus of the criticism has been the fact that \u00b7;:~~~.- the ADA would incorporate, by reference, the \"procedures and remedies\" of Section 1981, a post-civil war act ,.; \" aimed at prohibiting and punishing race discrimination. .. .. Unlike the equal employment opportunity laws passed during the past 25 years, Section 1981 was not spec-\u00b7 -\u00b7\u00b7 ifically designed to deal with issues of employment discrimination. Incorporating the procedures and remedies of that statute into the enforcement section of the ADA would create a law which differs in three significant ways from modern EEO laws. ' \\:.,. .. First, Section 1981 provides for litigation as the initial step in resolving a dispute. This is dif-, ... ~~ fcrcnt from modern EEO laws which generally require a litigant to first proceed through an administrative -\u00b7\u00b7.t process in an effort to promote voluntary resolution of the matter. with lawsuit being the avenue of last resort. Second. Section 1981 provides for an award of damages which goes well beyond the back pay damages common to employment discrimination cases under modern laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and religion. This potential for wind- fall damages tends to discourage litigants from accepting reasonable settlement offers, and it encourages lawyers and their clients to take their chance at trial in the hope of winning a million dollar verdict. Finally, once in court. Section 1981 provides the option for a jury trial, unlike Title VII, which pro- vides for trial before a judge in cases alleging employment discrimination. THE COURT HOUSE IS THE FIRST STOP By including section 1981 procedures in the ADA, the drafters provide individuals with a means of circum- venting the administrative process which has been critical to the success of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. believed by many to be the most effective employment discrimination law on the boo~. The \"proced- ures\" under Section 1981 are simple: A person needs only to walk into the court house and file a lawsuit. This approach is in sharp contrast to Title VII which requires litigants to at least give the administrative process a chance to resolve the dispute before it becomes a lawsuit. The Title VII procedures arc built upon the practical notion that the primary intent of an EEO law is the creation of employment opportunities. Thus, under Title VII it is considered preferable to resolve disputes through a prompt, fair conciliation which leads to a job opportunity than to resolve matters through a lawsuit which, years after the incident, provides a windfall monetary verdict as a way of punishing the employer. THE TRIAL AS A LOTTERY Recent news rcporu have highlighted the fact that in certain states plaintiffs are now selling shares to those who wish to \"invest\" in the lawsuit in the hope of sharing in the plaintiff's verdict or settlement award. The ADA, by including Section 1981 procedures and remedies, would promote a similar \"loncry\" or \"windfall\"\u00b7 attitude with respect to litigation of disability discrimination claims. The Section 1981 remedies would allow a litigant to win a full range of compensatory damages --such as an award of money for pain and suffering --as well as punitive damages. designed solely for the purpose of punishing the employer. Typically. in awarding such damages. the attorney seeking a large damage award as~ the jury to envision the injury the plaintiff has had to endure and to then try to calculate a sum that will adequately compensate Over - This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 163 of 175-. . ii:; . \u00b7~ti;:~ individual for !hat jury may !hen be asked to award pllnidve ciam&ics. based upon !he defen-:: ~!f.-4'.; dant's overall net worth. The results can be staggering. In a well-publicized case several years ago in \u00b7\u00b7 Colorado, a jury returned a St 7 million verdict against a large retailer In an age discrimination case. That \u00b7 decision was subsequently overturned on appeal. But, nonetheless, it demonstrates the \"sky ls the limit\" attitude which compensatory and punitive damages can bring to employment discrimination lawsuits. . The simple availablility of such damages, and the mere possibility of such a windfall award, is a sig- nificant factor long before the case reaches the trial stage. The potential for a windfall encourages the litigant and his or her attorney to reject reasonable settlement offers In favor of \"taking a shot\" at the brass ring and winning millions of dollars. -This is In contrast to the Tide VII approach which focuses on creating employment opportunities and providing back pay for an Individual who was the victim of illegal .. \u00b7 \u00b7 discrimination. '\" SYMPATHY/PREJUDICE IN THE COURTROOM Under Section 1981 procedures, the case may be decided, and the damages may be awarded by a jury, rather than a judge. While our society recognizes the value which a jury can bring to the process of deciding lawsuits, it is also recognized that in certain situations the facts before a jury can have an emotional Impact so strong that it is likely to interfere with the jury's deliberations and prejudice one of the litigants. Clearly, in the area of disability cases, the potential for such prejudice is high. In this area of the law; plaintiffs obviously wiU be individuals with disabilities. Is it realistic to think that jurors wiU be able to decide the case without being affected one way of the other by the fact? The only sensible approach Is the approach followed by Tide VII. In those cases where the parties are unable to work out their differences through the administrative process and end up in court, such decisions are best left to judges who can better view the facts without any cloud of sympathy for or prejudice against the litigants.

This bill will impact on every business in your district, and could be the most sweeping civil rights legislation to come out of the Congress in the last 20 years. I have therefore put together an action kit of materials for your use in discussing this controversial piece of legislation. This kit includes: 1) A memo, prepared by the minority staff of the Education and Labor Committee, giving a short breakdown of some of the ADA's more controversial aspects and problems. 2) A suggested letter from you to groups representing individuals with disabilities expressing your concerns about the ADA and your desire to work with them to discuss and resolve these concerns. 3) A list of suggested contacts regarding issues surrounding the ADA broken down by the bill's titles. 4) 5) A suggested letter from you to local Chambers and NFIB members alerting them to your concerns about the bill and soliciting their input on the bill. A copy of an op-ed piece on the ADA that recently appeared in The Washington Times. This is an extremely complicated bill and the issues surrounding it are highly charged emotionally. However, I believe that if we take some time to familiarize ourselves with the ADA and to make contact with interested groups representing the business and disabled communities to solicit their views, _ it should be possible to forge a consensus on this bill that should be acceptable to everyone .

Oefl11illo11 or tlls1/Jiliiy --The ADA includes a provision which would allow an Individual. \u00b7regarded as having an impairment; to be considered an individual with a disability. Although such a provision Is contained in other legislation that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, It would appear to allow very expansive coverage of Individuals and classes of individuals . such as those suspected of having AIDS. 2. \u00a3qu1I ir11/m1ni s/1ntl1rd --The ADA requires that equal and as effective means be offered to an lndlvldual with a disability so that such an individual may achieve the same result or outcome as other individuals. This appears to be a very rigorous standard that would not allow for a covered entity to offer a comparable trealmenUservice/opportunity for an individual to achieve a comparable, rather than the same. outcome. It is unclear how this standard would affect. and possibly restrict, efforts to provide reasonable accommodation. 3.

CThls provision Is contained only In title I which addresses general prohibitions.) The alcohol and drug provision would seem to potentially conflict with legislation requiring a drug free workplace. The provision pertaining to contagious disease or Infection would extend coverage to Individuals with AIDS or regarded as having AIDS. 4.

Having such a range of penalties may lead to severe opposition lo the legislation, and, if enacted, full employment for attorneys and inconsistency in interpretation of the law. 6. A/lo wince oi .. : In the provisions which define discrimination (for example, fail to provide opportunity, access, reasonable accommodation etc.), it is likely that covered entities would be subject to suits involving either kind of discrimination. \u00b7Fail to\u00b7 does not require conscious intent, It just requires that an action or lhe failure lo act has the effect of discrimination . Other language in the ADA also appears to prohibit practices wilh an adverse impact, regardless of intent, on idividuals with disabilities. It would seem appropriate lo limit the right to sue in cases of unintenllonal discrimination to specific circumstances where covered entities have experience, knowledge, and resources that would allow tham lo avoid such discrimination . 7.

SUGGESTED LETTER TO CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT GROUPS REPRESENTING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES (Suggest that you initiate contact with local Disabled Veterans of America organizations.) Dear As you may be aware, a bill called the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989 (ADA) was recently introduced to the Congress. This bill, which was introduced by my colleagues, Congressman Tony Coehlo in the House and Senator Tom Harkin in the Senate (HR2273 and S933, respectively), is a comprehensive effort to protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination. While I wholeheartedly support the goals of this bill, I am concerned with a number of its provrsions and would like to work with you in addressing these concerns. Of particular interest to me is the bill's broad definition of the term \"individuals with disabilities.\" Under the ADA, individuals \"who are regarded\" as having a disability are protected. I understand that this would include include alcoholics, drug addicts and persons with contagious diseases such as AIDS. This could jeopardize the nation's efforts to insure a \"drug free\" workplace and although the bill does state that such persons who pose a \"direct threat\" to the workplace need not be accommodated, I am concerned that the term \"direct threat\" is too vague. Another provision of interest, particularly as it might affect smaller businesses, is the fact that while the ADA exempts companies of under 15 employees from coverage, it does so only under the bill's employment provisions. I am concerned that this may be financially burdensome to smaller businesses, especially since the language stating that accommodation need not be made if it would cause \"undue hardship\" is not precise. I am also concerned about the ADA provisons that allow individuals to pursue a right of action if they believe that they are about to be discriminated against. These provisions could lead to a flood of litigation, and of course open the question of how a redress of injury can be made when the injury has not yet occurred. Of course, if all that is contemplated is injuctive relief under existing court procedures, this may be fine, but if a broader relief is contemplated, this could be a big problem. In a related matter, I believe that the ADA actually would encourage individuals to pursue litigation. I am concerned that a number of the enforcement provisions of this bill, combined with the fact that the ADA's Title II dealing with employment permits an individual to bypass standard EEOC administrative procedures and go straight to litigation, could be overly harsh and might be an incentive to some individuals to pursue frivilous This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 167 of 175.\u00b7\u00b7 ,\u00b7 court actions. Needless to say, I would like to see a reworking of these provisions so that they retain their effectiveness, but do so without turning the bill into pork barrel package for the legal community. Due to the very complex nature of this legislation, I have additional concerns of a more technical nature, suffice it to say that because I am genuinely committed to bringing individuals with disabilities not only into the workplace, but into the mainstream of American society as a whole, I would like to sit down with you to get your help in resolving these issues. I hope that you will take the opportunity to contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter. Sincerely, This document is from the collections at the Dole Archives, University of Kansas http://dolearchives.ku.edu Page 168 of 175SUGGESTED LETTER FROM MEMBERS TO LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE/NFIB AND OTHER INTERESTED BUSINESS GROUP MEMBERS. As you may be aware, a bill called the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1989 (ADA) was recently introduced to the Congress.

Needless to say, I would like to see a reworking of these provisions so that they retain their effectiveness, but so that they provide somewhat greater protection to employers. Finally, it is my belief that the ADA takes a punitive approach to the business community and that such an approach is unwarranted. This bill makes no distinction between intentional and unintentional discrimination as far as penalties are concerned. Businesses that are found to be in violation of this bill will be liable not only for restitution of damages, but also punitive damages and lawyer's fees. This represents a tremendous leap from principles in existing civil rights legislation .

WEDNESDAY, _JUNE 7, 1989 I PAGE E'l: COMMENTARY JJILL McCOLLUl\\'I A.cannon ~o-kill a butterfly Disregard for the moment defin-~ ing what the term \"direct threat\" means and focus on this irony: Even as the federal government is laying.:. down guidelines and exhorting em-r players -to provide a \"drug free\" workplace, this' bill would, in effect, make it impossible for employers to exclude drug addicts as a legitimate part of their applicant pool. \u00b7 Once past that contradiction. the question of defining \"direct threat\" / ;emerges.

As to the term \"undue hardship,\" about the\u00b7 only thing that is clear in that phrase is that it means anything short of bankruptcy. In essence, the fundamental flaw of the ADA is an attempt to define in simple terms that which by its \\\u00b7ery nature is not easily defined. Unlike racial or religious minorities which arc easily categorized. individuals with disabilities do not constitute a homogeneous group. It does no dis- service to the disabled communitv to point out. the ob\\\"ious fact that 0 the ---- \u00b7---needs of the blind are not necessar- ily related to the needs of the deaf when it comes to the question of bringing both groups into the mainstream of American life from which many have been ex- cluded. Nevertheless, . it is fl!nching from the obvious that has turned the ADA into a bill of sweeping generalities. The ADJ\\\"s authors argue that the bill's broad scope is the only way of assuring that individuals in the disabled com\u00b7 munity are protected and accommo\u00b7 dated across the hoard. However. it clcarlv renders no service to those with\u00b7 disabilittes to make their employment a matter of endless liti~ation. as this bill would almost certainly guarantee . Defend- ers of the ADA contend that this is the price that may ha\\'e to be paid for a more equitable socil\u00b7ty. Clearly though, that is a price that will be paid disproportionately by the dis- abled communitv when it becomes apparent that a iaw designed to en- sure their civil rights has become a law that has made their incorpora- tion into the workplace an expen- sive, hazardous undertaking that is best avoided if at all possible. 1hlk about cost in relation to the ADA bill and its proponents will J sniff huffily and say, \"Costs, when we 1 are talking about fundamental civil rights, should not be a matter of paramount concern.'~ \u00b7 , :. . .. . i Perhaps, but as Jared Elliot once , said, \"Facts are stubborn things,\" ! and the stubborn fact is that the ADA's wholesale approach to -the problem of rights for the disabled community is needlessly expensive and open to endless court battles as terms like \"direct threat\" and \"undue hardship\" are defined and redefined for each new situation that arises. Furthermore, costs, whether ADA proponents like it or not, are something employers must take into account when they make hiring decisions. No one opposes the objectives of the ADA bill. However, virtuous goals without a sufficient apprecia- tion of the real problems that must be faced in reaching those goals are fated ne\\\"er to be realized.
