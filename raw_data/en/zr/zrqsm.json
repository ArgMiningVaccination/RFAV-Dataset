[Modern medicine](MM) has been excellent in identifying the [virus], sequencing its mutants, and [monitoring]the [pandemic]progress. However, due to lack of effective [antivirals]in the first two years of the [pandemic], MM treated COVID-19 mainly by conventional supportive care with limited [efficacy]. In [China], [traditional Chinese medicine](TCM) has been actively participating the control of COVID-19, and the combination of TCM and conventional supportive care has shown better efficacies than the conventional care alone. Purpose:Clinical studies have shown that TCM treats COVID-19 through a holistic action, such as [repairing]organ [injuries], anti- [inflammation], immunoregulation and [antiviral]activities, etc. However, it is not clear how TCM is able to achieve these effects, and the scientific interpretation of TCM theories is lacking. This [review]aims to elucidate the scientific basis underlying TCM theories in the context of [host-pathogen interaction]and provide a working model for TCM in treating [infectious diseases]. [Procedure]This [review]focuses on the essential of performs an in-depth [analysis]of current [literatures], including TCM theories and clinical studies as well as the most recent findings of tolerance ( [self]-healing) mechanism in biomedical [sciences]. Conclusion:TCM treats COVID-19 through a holistic [regulation]of host responses, particularly by promoting [patients]' [self]-healing [power]and balancing host-centered TCM require specific [antivirals]and has less side-effects and [drug resistance]. This [review]provides a scientific insight into the mechanism of TCM and sheds a [light]on the prospective integration of TCM and MM for [future]challenges. : : : ScienceDirect : : : : Pharmacological Research - Modern Chinese Medicine : 2022 : , MEDLINE ...
