This spiritual meditation provides guided imagery and affirmations designed to help listeners find intuitive understanding and spiritual guidance for an issue, question or concern they face; or it can simply support their general spiritual wellness or meditative practice, naturally and holistically. Created as a heart-based complement to prayer or reflection, this spiritual meditation helps listeners live in greater harmony with their deepest purpose and highest good. Evocative guided imagery and immersive, inspiring music combine to set up powerful preconditions for attaining insight, clarity, balance and perspective. Here's the track list: 1. Introduction (2:42) 2. Guided Imagery (19:09) 3. Affirmations (21:42) Guided imagery is a holistic, mind-body technique that consists of positive words and images, set to soothing music, to achieve specific goals of healing, learning, growth or spiritual wellness. Repeated listening once or twice a day for 2-3 weeks ensures maximum impact. The spiritual guidance recording is written and narrated by guided imagery pioneer and mind-body-spirit expert Belleruth Naparstek, scored by award winning composer Steven Mark Kohn, and produced by the Cleveland Orchestra's Bruce Gigax. The immersive narrative is designed to evoke the symbols and figures from the faith tradition or value system of the listener, to help open inner gateways to spiritual wellness and strength, and allow for communion with divine guidance and wisdom. The imagery is generic but powerful enough to appeal to anyone, religious and non-religious alike. A separate track of affirmations offers briefer versions of the same images and ideas, for those who prefer to use a briefer, more flexible format to achieve spiritual guidance and understanding. Listen to a sample and see why this spiritual guidance gets such strong word of mouth endorsement and reviews.
