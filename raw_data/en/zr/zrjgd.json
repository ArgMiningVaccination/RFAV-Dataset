Riley Jr., unveil the cornerstone for the new hospital. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development insured $401 million in bonds to finance the hospital project. This figure insures both bonds for the new construction project and re-funding of existing debts. The consolidation of these debts is a requirement for the new funding. From left are Dr. J.G.

Timeline 2005 Feb. 14: Began hospital construction April: CEP begins operation and delivery of HVAC capacity for hospital construction 2008 Deputy secretary is guest speaker for ceremonyRoy A. Bernardi Deputy Secretary Department of Housing and Urban Development Roy A. Bernardi serves as deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is charged with managing HUD's day-to-day operations, a $32 billion annual budget and the agency's 9,100 employees. As HUD's chief operating officer, Bernardi will continue to meet President Bush's management agenda to improve ethics and accountability within HUD's programs and among its grant partners. Roy Bernardi speaks during the ceremony April 8. Behind Bernardi is from left Stuart Smith, Rep. Henry Brown; Dr. Don Johnson, MUSC President Dr. Ray Greenberg and Rep. James E. Clyburn. \"HUD is proud to help the Medical University of South Carolina to continue growing into the state-of-the-art medical campus it is today,\" said Bernardi. \"This is the second largest loan commitment HUD has ever made. By insuring this $400 million mortgage, we expect to save the University, and South Carolina taxpayers, approximately $110 million.\" Bernardi formerly served as HUD's assistant secretary of Community Planning and Development (CPD) helping to develop viable communities by promoting integrated solutions to the challenges facing the nation's cities, urban counties and rural communities. These strategies are a tremendous benefit to local communities seeking to create decent housing, suitable living conditions and economic opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons. To do this, Bernardi promoted a deeper sense of partnership among all levels of government, the private sector and non-profit organizations. Prior to joining the Bush Administration, Bernardi was the 51st mayor of the City of Syracuse, New York and is still affectionately referred to as \"Mayor Bernardi\" at the department. As Syracuse's five-term city auditor, Bernardi overhauled municipal financial services, eliminated duplicative departmental functions and streamlined governmental operations resulting in significant annual budget savings.
