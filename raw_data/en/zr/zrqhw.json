It is designed to educate our pa tients who have questions about this topic. This sheet is not to be taken as medical advice. Be sure to seek proper medical advice for all health conditions and choices. We are not trying to persuade anyone to vaccinate or not, only inform them of the possible issues. What is the H1N1 flu? H1N1 refers to influenza cases that are caused by Orthomyxoviruses e ndemic to pig populations. H1N1 infects people every year and is found typically in people who have been in contact with pigs, although person-to-person transmission is now common. There is no research that can predict who is at risk and who is not. What the history of previous Influenza pandemics has indicated is that patients who had the greatest mortality rate were those wi th a compromised immune system before the initial Influenza virus infection.7 What are the symptoms of the H1N1 Flu? Symptoms are similar to those of regular human flu and include fever , cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, disorientation, chills and fatigue. Some patie nts have also reported stiffness of the joints, neck, diarrhea and vomiting.7 The H1N1 is just another flu. According to the World Health Organization as of October 25, 2009 there have been 440,000 H1N1 conrmed cases, and 5700 (1.3%) d eaths worldwide.20 According to Health Canada s website, anywhere from 10% to 25% of the Canadian popul ation will get the common seasonal flu per year (3,100,000 to 7,750,000).21 Health Canada estimates that anywhere from 4000 to 8000 in Canada die of the seasonal flu per year (0.13% to 0.25%).21 The H1N1 virus is no stronger than a regular flu. According to th e World Health Organization (WHO) \"The majority of people who contract the virus experience the mil der disease and recover without antiviral treatment or medical care.\"18 Almost all people who have the severe form have an underlying health condition.18 The only way to properly diagnose the H1N1 flu is to get a lab test done by throat swab. There are possible false positive and negative results from this test. We do not perform this test in our ofce, it can only be performed in a hospital or medical doctor s ofce.Dr. Michael Nowazek BSc, ND Suite #221, 9148 1H9 P. 780.485.9468 f. 780.485.3587 www.greenapplehealthcare.ca \u00a9 2009 Green Apple Health Care Ltd. ! Page 1 of 7What is the H1N1 Vaccine? Vaccines are designed to educate the immune system about the disease being vaccinated for. Typically a piece of the virus is injected into the arm, sti mulating your body to create antibodies to the disease. The body should then have antibodies ready if it ever comes into contact with that disease in nature. The controversy is that by injecting the vaccine it bypasses sections of the immune system in the respiratory and digestive systems that setup a natural immun ity to a disease.9 The H1N1 vaccine has been developed internationally in re sponse to the public concern about the possibility of the H1N1 flu causing serious health problems w orldwide, specically a pandemic. There is concern that large numbers of people could be affected se riously by the disease. It takes about 14 days for the body to produce enough of an immune response t o be considered immune to the condition. The goal is to vaccinate as many high risk pop ulations or other people in the general population to decrease the possibility of serious H1N1 flu symp toms, the effect it has on workforce and school populations and reduce the death rate. High risk populations are dened by Health Canada currentl y as people with chronic conditions, pregnant women, children 6 months old to 5 years old, peop le in remote communities, health care workers and people who live in the houses of these other hig h risk people.3 What concerns are there regarding the vaccine? 1.The vaccine is the best way to prevent this disease. There are many ways to prevent colds and flus, the vaccine is no t the only way, and depending on the person it may not be the best way. Some people may ha ve allergies to the ingredients, or have immune system problems.3 No one treatment is perfect for everyone or everything. Naturopathic medicine has many options available for pat ients for preventing all diseases.7 Naturopathic medicine works by improving your immune system overall so that you can ght off any disease. 2.There are possible side effects, some of them very serio us. All proponents of the H1N1 vaccine admit there are possible si de effects to this vaccine. Most of the side effects are minor like soreness at the site, fever, sore e yes, itching. Other side effects that are currently reported include anaphylaxis (severe allergy) or Guillian-Barre Syndrome (nerve degeneration and paralysis, this can be temporary or permanent ). There has been no testing on the long term side effects of this vaccine. 3 3.The disease is so severe that everyone needs a vaccin e. Like all flu viruses, there are people who will react in a wid e range of possible ways, from mild to severe symptoms. The H1N1 is no different. Health Canada i s currently recommending that patients at high risk of severe symptoms get vaccinated. Some people have died from this condition, however Dr. Michael Nowazek BSc, ND Suite #221, 9148 - 23 1H9 P. 780.485.9468 f. 780.485.3587 www.greenapplehealthcare.ca \u00a9 2009 Green Apple Health Care Ltd. ! Page 2 of 7it has been determined that they almost all of them had a pre existing health condition that either caused or contributed to the death. Health canada is no t recommending we test everyone to know how many people are getting the H1N1 flu and doing ne w ith it. This makes it difcult to determine the percentage of the conrmed cases that are severe and compare t hat to the regular flu. Thousands of patients die from the regular flu each year, many mo re than the H1N1 to date.3 As mentioned above, according to the WHO, this flu is no stronge r than a regular seasonal flu.18 4.The vaccine is untested. Parts of the H1N1 vaccine have had limited testing, not all of it. There were 2 studies done, the rst had 63 people, the second had 66.1,4 There are no long term studies or history of this vaccine to determine the side effects beyond 7 days. Much of the informa tion available for the H1N1 vaccine is borrowed from the H5N1 vaccine, a completely different vaccine. It is controversial that the vaccine has been developed and distributed so quickly. There have been no long term testing done beyond 7 days, it is impossible to know what types of conditions coul d develop in a year after this vaccine.1 The vaccine has not been tested on pregnant females or anyone under 18 years old.1 The last time this type of vaccine was so quickly developed a nd administered, there were many cases of Guillian-Barre Syndrome.15 Although health ofcials claim the standards are higher now, and the rates of that disease were low.3 It is worth noting that certain aspects of this vaccine have not been tested at all or enough to know what will happen. Specically these are the mercury and adjuvan ts in the vaccine. According to GSK there is no experience with the H5N1 vaccine (t he different vaccine that is being used as the base for H1N1, it is the vaccine for the bird flu) on children under 3 years of age or 10 to 17 years of age. There is also no testing on pregnant or la ctating females.1,4 5.The vaccine contains mercury. This is probably the most controversial aspect to any vaccine. The multi dose form of the H1N1 vaccine does contain mercury (specically Thimerosal) according to Hea lth Canada. It is used as a preservative to prevent contamination of the vaccine. Health C anadas website downplays any possible side effect form mercury in this vaccine. Thimerosal is a fo rm of ethyl mercury. 3 Mercury is a toxic element found in nature. The human body does not have natural ways to remove mercury, it will accumulate and build up in your body. Tha t is why it is often called a toxic or heavy metal. There are different types of mercury, inorganic (metal mercu ry) and organic mercury.8 Organic mercury is the type of mercury found connected to organi c compounds found in the human body. There are 2 main types of organic mercury, methyl mercury, an d ethyl mercury. 8 Methyl mercury is the only type of mercury that has been tested in humans. Ethyl mercury has not been tested as much, although some small research projects are now emerging. 8 Dr. Michael Nowazek BSc, ND Suite #221, 9148 - 23 1H9 P. 780.485.9468 f. 780.485.3587 www.greenapplehealthcare.ca \u00a9 2009 Green Apple Health Care Ltd. ! Page 3 of 7Methyl mercury is highly toxic to the nervous system. It will cro ss into the brain. The known effects short term are numbness, low energy, vision problems, hearing prob lems and concentration problems. At very high doses, it can cause death. Long term e ffects are immune and heart problems. It is well known that a developing fetus is t he most at risk if the pregnant mother has exposure.6,8 Ethyl mercury has not been tested as much as methyl mercury, so the short term and long term effects are unknown. Some recent studies show that ethyl mercury is found in the brain 3 times less than methyl mercury, but it is still found in the brain.5 Since so few studies exist on the effects of ethyl mercury, Health Canada and the USFDA decided that Thimerosal (which is a form of ethyl mercury) be removed form childhood vaccines since it could be as toxic a s methyl mercury. 8 All health effects of ethyl mercury, and therefor Thimerosal, are based on the kno wn research regarding methyl mercury. 8 According to the information sheet on the H1N1 vaccine provided by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline the manufacturer) the vaccine has 2.5 micrograms of ethyl mercury per 0. 5mL dose of vaccine. 1,4 According to the WHO a 60kg (132 lbs) person should get no more than 0.47 micrograms per kg of body weight (28.2 micrograms) of methyl mercury per day.6,8 So technically the amount in the vaccine is below the WHO daily maximum for an adult male. The WHO also recommends that daily total for a pregnant female be no more than 13.8 micrograms pe r day of methyl mercury.6,8 There is no recommended dosage of methyl mercury for children und er 18.6 The vaccine dosage of ethyl mercury has not been adjusted for children. Methyl mercury is the kind of mercury found in sh. The amount o f methyl mercury in sh varies widely depending on the type of sh. Albacore tuna has b een measured to be one of the highest, having 0.36 ppm (1ppm = 1microgram per gram), so per 142 gram can of tuna there is 51.12 micrograms of methyl mercury. It is worth noting that most other canned tuna has 0.09 ppm or 12.78 micrograms of methyl mercury.6 Many ofcials supporting vaccination state there is more mercury in a can of tuna sh than in the vaccines.3 6.The vaccine contains adjuvants Adjuvants are \"things\" (as dened by Health Canada)3 in a vaccine that are supposed to increase the immune response to the vaccine. It is used to increase the respo nse when there is a low supply of vaccine. In the H1N1 vaccine the adjuvants used in this vacci ne are Polysorbate 80, squalene and vitamin E.1 The controversy is that the immune response with them are highl y variable. Some research shows that there are areas of the immune system that can be activated that you don t want activated by adjuvants. This could lead to auto immu ne and chronic inflammatory conditions, where the immune system attacks your own body, not the disease.10 The H1N1 adjuvant vaccine being used in Canada has not b een tested.1 Other vaccines with adjuvants have been tested, not the H1N1 vaccine Michael Nowazek BSc, ND 1H9 P. 780.485.9468 f. 780.485.3587 www.greenapplehealthcare.ca \u00a9 2009 Green Apple Health Care Ltd. ! Page 4 of 7As of Tuesday October 27, 2009 Health Canada is attempt ing to make unadjuvant vaccines available for pregnant females.2 There are other ingredients in the vaccine includin g egg protein, formaldehyde, sodium deoxychocolate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, and sucrose.1 7.Immune diversion (susceptibility to other diseases) It is possible that the regular flu vaccine could make people more susceptible to the H1N1 virus.17 It is believed that during the rst 2 weeks of getting a vaccine l ike the regular flu vaccine, your immune system is concentrating on that disease and more susceptible to other conditions. This is still in preliminary research, and not conrmed. 8.Mutation Like the seasonal flu, the H1N1 can mutate or changed forms, maki ng the current vaccine useless.16 Every year a new season flu vaccine is created by the WHO. They attempt to determine which of the many emerging flu viruses are going to be dominant in that yea r. The vaccine is then created from the top 3 best guesses. It is believed that for the past 7 years the vaccine for the regular seasonal flu was wrong, as the virus mutated before the vaccine was administere d to the public. 9.Source of the vaccine It is unclear what the source of the vaccine is, or what pa rt of the virus is being used to create the vaccine.1 GSK or GlaxoSmithKline is the vaccine manufacturer in Canada. The vaccine is called Arepanrix. Their website has a detailed information sheet available for download on the H1N1 vaccine.1 See our references page for more info and to access this. What other treatments are available Naturopathic doctors work with their patients to strength en their immune systems overall, so that they are better able to ght off all possible viruses, including the H1N1 flu.19 There are many naturopathic treatments used to do this, and it is highly individuali zed for what each patient needs specically. Keeping your immune system strong and healthy is an excellent way to prevent many diseases or reduce their severity. One homeopathic remedy used for strengthening the body s immune response to any viral infection is Engystol \u00ae. This product can increase the immune system s 33%.11,12,13 Another remedy that is used with Engystol\u00ae is Gripp-Heel\u00ae. Gripp-Heel\u00ae is used to treat the symptoms of any viral cold or flu infection.14 When combined with Engystol\u00ae it can increase the immune system by 41%.12 Dr. Michael Nowazek BSc, ND Suite #221, 9148 1H9 P. 780.485.9468 f. 780.485.3587 www.greenapplehealthcare.ca \u00a9 2009 Green Apple Health Care Ltd. !
