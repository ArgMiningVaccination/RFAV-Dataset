THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO ELEVATE NM'S REPUTATION THROUGH: C ontinued investment in research, innovation and the experience of patients, physicians and staff; D eepening connections between hospitals and clinicians with Feinberg, the Kellogg School of Management, McCormick Defining a Great Academic Health System S WE CLOSE ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL FISCAL YEAR, one that included the opening of a new hospital in Lake Forest, implementation of a single electronic health record across the health system and advancement of many strategic goals, I am pleased to update you on the next chapter of the Northwestern Medicine (NM) strategic plan. This effort was initiated to better understand characteristics that define a great academic health system. A broad group of internal and external stakeholders shared perceptions of NM's current strengths and where there were opportunities to further elevate performance. W e are grateful for the thoughts and feed- back from leaders at Northwestern University and the Feinberg School of Medicine, as well as numerous valued partners, dedicated board members, advisors, patients and employees. We learned: GREAT ACADEMIC HEAL TH SYSTEMS: P rovide outstanding clinical care informed by groundbreaking research, led by nationally recognized clinicians and scientists; Ar e a destination not only for patients, but for physicians, scientists and others who want to practice in an environment that is patient-focused, collaborative and innovative; A chieve consistent results that optimize the patient experience.A School of Engineering and more broadly, Northwestern University; Gr eater focus on telling the NM story through superior patient outcomes, groundbreaking discoveries and our collaborative culture. S ince NM articulated its vision \"to become a premier integrated academic health system\" in 2015, significant progress has been made to integrate business functions such as finance, information technology and human resources. NM's 34 business services now are able to efficiently scale with the growth of the health system. Since NM articulated its vision 'to become a premier integrated academic health system' in 2015, significant progress has been made to integrate business functions such as finance, information technology and human resources. Wit h the implementation of a single instance of an electronic health record, NM's caregivers are now connected across the health system. This technology, along with the formation of system-wide clinical collab- oratives, positions NM to accelerate clinical integration to improve patient outcomes and safety. One example is the evolution of the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute (BCVI). Formed in 2004, it has been the No. 1 cardiovascular program in Illinois for 10 straight years. An early result of clinical integration in BCVI is the expansion of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) program to the far western suburbs, effectively scaling and connecting NM's intellectual strength for patients to receive advanced care where they live and work. D ue in no small part to the extraordinary partnership between Northwestern University and Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, Northwestern Medicine is uniquely positioned for greatness in a turbulent and rapidly evolving industry. I look forward to providing further updates on NM's year-end results and the next chapter of NM's \"Good to Great\" journey. With warm regards, Dean M.

Deerfield will provide up to $65 million in targeted funding and deep development expertise to advance promising Northwestern research. During an ev ent introducing the collaboration in June, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the partnership \"an important part of Chicago's future,\" adding that biomedical research and innovation are an essential part of the city's growing economy. \" This exciting partnership combines two cutting-edge institutions under one roof to serve patients and save lives,\" Mayor Emanuel said. \" As a global hub for healthcare innovation, Chicago is the perfect home for this new venture, and we look forward to working together as we continue to advance medical care in the 21st century.\" Eric G . Neilson, MD, vice president for Medical Affairs and the Lewis Landsberg Dean, said Lakeside Discovery provides needed funding that can speed up the research process. \" Society is quite impatient for great advances, but biomedical research is not a sprint \u2014 it's more like a relay,\" Neilson said. \"It takes an unpredictable amount of time. If society wants to quicken the pace, it has to provide more fuel, and this is where the Deerfield partnership can be a great benefit for our shared goals.\" C ombined with the 2019 opening of the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center , Lakeside Discovery will further strengthen Northwestern's position as one of the leading academic medical research centers in the world, said Alicia L\u00f6ffler , PhD, executive director of Northwestern's Innovation and New Ventures Office. Lak eside will tackle projects approved by a joint steering committee comprised of members from the Northwestern and Deerfield scientific leadership teams. Northwestern members will initially include Neilson, L\u00f6ffler and Richard Silverman, PhD, the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. The y will use their experiential scientific knowledge, in consultation with Deerfield, to assess each proposal's potential biological and commercial success. Projects will be selected based on many criteria, with an emphasis on the novelty of biological insight, regardless of its stage of development. Pr ojects accepted by Lakeside will be supported with a complete development plan, including vital experiments needed to reach Investigational New Drug-readiness in an expedited time frame. Deerfield also will support Lakeside with operational expertise.\"THIS EXCITING PARTNERSHIP COMBINES TWO CUTTING- EDGE INSTITUTIONS UNDER ONE ROOF TO SERVE PATIENTS AND SA VE LIVES.\" RAHM EMANUEL Mayor of Chicago Leaders from Northwestern University and Deerfield Management at a June event celebrating the new Lakeside Discovery collaboration.

If you remove the gene that produces MYC, tumors wither and leukemia remits. But it's been tough to design a molecule to inhibit MYC. The protein is all smooth, slick surfaces with no handy grooves for a molecule to latch on. Scientists had given up on it. En ter Sarki Abdulkadir, MD, PhD, vice chair for research in the Department of Urology and the John T. Grayhack, MD, Professor of Urological Research. With Gary Schiltz, PhD, and Rama Mishra, PhD, from Northwestern's Center for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery, Abdulkadir used molecular modeling to test 16 million compounds to see if their geometric structure could bind to the protein. He di scovered several candidates, synthesized the most promising ones and began testing them in animals. They caused regression in prostate cancer and leukemia in animal models. In human cancer cell lines, the compounds inhibited more than a dozen types of cancer. F or a compound to be considered as a candidate drug for clinical trials, Abdulkadir needs funding to conduct extensive testing in larger animals. National Institutes of Health grants cover only basic science and early animal studies. \"If y ou give a compound to a living organism, where does it go ... to the liver, the kidney?\" asked Abdulkadir, also a professor of Pathology and a member of the Lurie Cancer Center. \"How is it excreted from the body? Does it stay in the fat for a long time? What's the safety profile? Is it easy to dissolve in a solution so you can inject it? We need to understand all that. You can't jump from mice to humans. These things take time and a lot of resources.\" If o ne of Abdulkadir's compounds is chosen as a candidate for NewCures, an outside lab will conduct a raft of experi-ments on the drug so it's ready for consid-eration as an investigational drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and a candidate for acquisition. \"YOU CAN'T JUMP FROM MICE TO HUMANS. THESE THINGS TAKE TIME AND A LOT OF RESOURCES.\"Setting the Stage for Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Partnerships The words nobody wants to hear from a pharmaceutical company after presenting a new potential drug that obliterates cancer in mice: \"It's too early.\" That's code for: \"We're not convinced this could actually work and is safe for humans.\" N ewCures at Northwestern University is a novel accelerator poised to prevent that brush-off. It will identify the most promising new potential therapies in development at the university for cancer , depression, pain, Parkinson's disease and other diseases. Then it will fund outside research to answer the key questions a pharmaceutical company typically requires before it agrees to invest in later-stage development, such as clinical trials. N orthwestern is on the crest of an early wave of universities accelerating the devel-opment of their therapies as pharmaceutical companies shift from completely developing in-house drugs to licensing proven technology from academia and startups. \" There's a new ecosystem of small biotechs spun from academic research collaborating with larger industry partners,\" said Karl Scheidt, PhD, NewCures executive director and professor of Pharmacology and of Chemistry at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. \"We need to understand what they're looking for .\" An e xternal advisory board of pharma- ceutical executives, venture capitalists and scientific leaders help choose the therapies for NewCures and how to invest in these new technologies. \"Y ou need to understand what other therapies are available and in development, and how a discovery can be turned into a treatment that will help patients better than what is already out there,\" explained Scott Brun, MD, vice president of scientific affairs and head of AbbVie Ventures, who is a member of the NewCures external advisory board.

After earning a bachelor's degree in animal science in 2013, she was set to attend veterinary school. But when an accident tha t summer left Schroth with a serious spinal cord injury, she realized her true passion lied in human medicine \u2014 and she ultimately found her way to Feinberg's Medical Scientist Training Program. Since beginning at Northwestern in August 2017, Schroth has dedicated herself not only to the normal activities of a medical student, but also to advocating for people of all abilities. In April, during her class 's musculo- skeletal module, Schroth developed a unique activity that allowed her fellow classmates to experience what it's like to live a day in a wheelchair . In the per sonal essay below, Schroth shares how she hopes this experience helps medical students ultimately become better physicians. \" Wheeling\" is a rather recent addition to my life. Five years ago, a week after graduating from college, I was standing in the front yard of a friend's cabin on a beautiful day when a dead tree fell on me \u2014 resulting in a spinal cord injury and paralysis below the mid-chest. F ast forward through three months in the ICU, rehabilitation and many months (if not years) of adjustment and trial-by- error learning. It 's no surprise that becoming a paraplegic is a big change. But I was surprised by some of those changes: how differently I was treated and the countless entities of day-to-day life \u2014 curb cutouts, stairs, bathroom stalls \u2014 that I now needed to pay attention to and navigate. This exp erience isn't uncommon. According to a 2012 report by the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly one in five people self-report having a disability. Why does this matter? Because as future physicians, I and all of my peers will one day have patients who identify as disabled. Understanding the impact disability can have on day-to-day life is vital in treating these patients with both dignity and respect. It 's said that experience is life's best teacher, and I couldn't agree more; thus \"A Day in a Wheelchair\" was born. I planned and organized an experience to allow my classmates the opportunity to experience life the way I and many of our future patients do \u2014 on wheels. Samantha Schroth, a second-year MD/PhD student and wheelchair user, planned the activity to help her classmates develop more empathy for their patients with disabilities. \"I PLANNED AND ORGANIZED AN EXPERIENCE TO ALLOW MY CLASSMATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE LIFE THE WAY I AND MANY OF OUR FUTURE PATIENTS DO \u2014 ON WHEELS.\" Medical students Cindy Wu and Francisco Cai wait for public transportation during their \"Day in a Wheelchair\" last spring.Unique Learning Experiences Expose Students to Patient Perspectives F or the duration of our four-week musculoskeletal module, two wheelchairs were available to be \"checked out\" for an entire day. Students attended classes, traveled to an off-campus location of their choosing and even attempted public transit \u2014 all with the intention of developing a greater sense of empathy and appreciation for just some of the many challenges wheelchair users face.9 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGOn Campus WRITTEN BY Will Doss PHOTOGRAPHY COURTESY OF Shirley Ryan AbilityLabStudents Look Beyond the Chart at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab All medical students at Feinberg complete a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation clerkship, a two-week rotation housed at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, the top-ranked rehabilitation hospital in the nation. Instilling in students an under standing of the connection between illness and ability is a major goal of the clerkship, according to Leslie Rydberg, '05 MD, '09 GME, assistant professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and clerkship director . \"N o matter what field of medicine students choose to go into, patients care about their function,\" said Rydberg. \"For example, a patient seeing a cardiologist doesn't necessarily care what their cholesterol number is \u2014 they care about how it makes them feel and how it plays into their ability.\" R ydberg was introduced to physical medicine and rehabilitation as a first- year student at Feinberg, and learned the principles of rehabilitation medicine firsthand from leaders in the field. \"I w as lucky to have the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago \u2014 now the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab \u2014 right on campus,\" Rydberg said. \"Once I learned about the breadth and depth of the field, and the focus on function, I knew I had found my specialty.\" During the cler kship, Feinberg students perform physical examinations, attend therapy sessions and coordinate care \u2014 activities designed to acclimate them to patients with disabilities, expose them to disability-specific conditions and encourage them to think beyond merely what's on a patient's chart. \"W e're trying to get students thinking about how much assistance the patients need, what their homes look like or what kind of therapies they need,\" Rydberg said. \"How do their impairments limit their ability to function at home or in the community?\" While it 's still a hospital-based rotation, performing patient rounds at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab is a fundamentally different experience compared to other rotations, according to Charles Cogan, '18 MD, who completed his rotation in April. \"P atients are right in front of you, going through their physical therapy or occupational therapy,\" Cogan said. \"You get a snapshot of how this patient is doing and get to know them as a person.\" The par tnership between Feinberg and the nation's top-ranked rehabilitation hospital since 1991 \u2014 according to rankings by U.S. News and World Report \u2014 is unique among medical schools, said Rydberg. \" There's only a handful of schools across the country that have a required PM&R rotation,\" she said. \"Most facilities don't have the infrastructure to support an entire class of medical students rotating through.\" Read more about the medical school's collaborations with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab on page 18.Inside look at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab RESEARCH BRIEFS In a study published in Science Translational Medicine, investigators discovered a new compound that halts the spread of cancer cells. C o-corresponding author Sui Huang, MD, PhD, associate professor of Cell and Molecular Biology, had already identified the complex marker that indicates cancer cells' ability to transform into metastasizing \"multiple-headed monsters,\" as she describes them. In t he new study, she and colleagues found a compound that blows up the monsters and significantly reduced metastasis by human prostate, pancreatic and breast cancer transplanted into mice. Mi ce treated with the compound, metarrestin, had fewer metastatic tumors in the lung and liver, and lived longer than mice that did not receive treatment. \"It 's like a dirty bomb against cancer,\" said Huang, also a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, describing metarrestin's potency against metastasizing cells. \"It could potentially result in a better outcome for patients with solid tumor cancers with high potential to spread to other organs. It's promising.\" Me tarrestin will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration for approval as an investigational drug in the near future, with the goal of launching a clinical trial. There currently is not a drug aimed at selectively preventing cancer metastasis. S cientists from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the University of Kansas, the National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCAT) and Chen Wang, a research associate in Huang's lab, worked closely as a team to make this discovery possible. The study was funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and NCI, the National Human Genome Research Institute grant U54HG005031, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences grants R01GM078555 and R01GM0115710, NCI grant 2 P30 CA060553-19, the V Foundation, the Baskes family, the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center \u2014 Translational Bridge Program Fellowship in Lymphoma Research, and the Molecular Libraries Initiative funding to the University of Kansas Specialized Chemistry Center.Scientists have identified a key enhancer of Sox9 \u2014 a gene critical for male sex development \u2014 and demonstrated that deleting the enhancer results in male-to-female sex reversal in mice. The study , published in Science, deepens understanding of the normal process of sex determination in mammals. Its findings could also could help improve the genetic diagnosis of patients with differences in sex development (DSDs), in which reproductive organs don't develop as expected. Currently, only about 20 percent of such patients receive a genetic diagnosis. The S ox9 gene is crucial for male differentiation and the proper formation of testes; if Sox9 is mutated or incorrectly expressed, an individual who is chromosomally male (XY) can develop ovaries instead of testes. Pr eviously, it was known that some patients with DSDs have changes in their genome near the Sox9 gene that alter its expression and lead to sex reversal. But it was unclear exactly why. In the current study, scientists identified an enhancer (a short region of DNA that can increase gene transcription) that is necessary to regulate expression of the Sox9 gene. The Science study was a collaboration between the laboratories of the late Danielle Maatouk, PhD, assistant professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and corresponding author Robin Lovell-Badge, PhD, of the Francis Crick Institute in London. Alexandra Garc\u00eda-Moreno and Isabella Salamone, both fifth-year doctoral students in Feinberg's Driskill Graduate Program in Life Sciences, and Christopher Futtner, a research associate, were also co-authors. \" Often genes important for sex determination are also crucial for other developmental processes, and a mutation in one gene or its regulatory region can impact a patient's health in many ways,\" explained Salamone. \" As we begin to understand the genetic underpinnings of these disorders, we can improve our care of these patients.\" The study was supported by the Francis Crick Institute, which receives its core funding from Cancer Research UK (FC001107), the UK Medical Research Council (FC001107), and the Wellcome (FC001107); and by the UK Medical Research Council (U117512772). The study was also supported by the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR blanc T estisDev) and Feinberg.UNDERSTANDING THE EPIGENETICS OF SEX DETERMINATIONSCIENTIFIC ADVANCES A New Weapon Against Cancer MetastasisDISEASE DISCOVERIES 10 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018PULSE WRITTEN BY Firstname Lastname PHOTOGRAPHY BY Firstname LastnameMore details on these studies at magazine.nm.orgLaws that ban smoking at work and other public places are associated with a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease, even after controlling for a variety of factors, according to a new Northwestern Medicine study. The study , published in Circulation, found that smoke-free policies in workplaces were associated with a nearly 50 percent reduction in risk among middle-aged adults, while policies for bars and restaurants were linked to a reduction of around 25 percent. Kiarri K ershaw, PhD, MPH, assistant professor of Preventive Medicine in the Division of Epidemiology, was the senior author of the study. Stephanie Mayne, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Preventive Medicine, was the first author. The findings ar e consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated a link between smoke-free policies \u2014 which aim to decrease exposure to secondhand smoke \u2014 and a reduced risk of heart disease among the population. But the current study is the first to account for various characteristics of the study population, including participants' health behaviors and cardiovascular risk factors, as well as geographic factors like state cigarette taxes, which could confound results. The study 's findings support the continued expansion of smoke-free policies in indoor public places. \" Our results suggest smoke-free policies may prevent cardiovascular disease among young to middle-aged adults, but much of the U.S. population is not currently covered by smoke-free policies. Only 25 states have laws banning smoking in all workplaces, bars and restaurants,\" Mayne said. SMOKE-FREE POLICIES LINKED TO LOWER HEART DISEASE RISKCLINICAL BREAKTHROUGHS A simple scrape or sore might not cause alarm for most people. But for diabetic patients, an untreated scratch can turn into an open wound that could lead to a limb amputation or even death. A No rthwestern University team has developed a new device, called a regenerative bandage, that quickly heals these painful, hard-to-treat sores without using drugs. During head-to-head tests published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Northwestern's bandage healed diabetic wounds 33 percent faster than one of the most popular bandages currently on the market. \"T he novelty is that we identified a segment of a protein in skin that is important to wound healing, made the segment and incorporated it into an antioxidant molecule that self-aggregates at body temperature to create a scaffold that facilitates the body's ability to regenerate tissue at the wound site,\" said Guillermo Ameer, ScD, who led the study. \"With this newer approach, we're not releasing drugs or outside factors to accelerate healing. And it works very well.\" B ecause the bandage leverages the body's own healing power without releasing drugs or biologics, it faces fewer regulatory hurdles. This means patients could see it on the market much sooner. Although Ameer's laboratory is specifically interested in diabetes applications, the bandage can be used to heal all types of open wounds. Am eer is a professor of Surgery in the Division of Vascular Surgery and of Biomedical Engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering. Regenerative Bandage Accelerates Healing in Diabetic WoundsCLINICAL BREAKTHROUGHS \"WITH THIS NEWER APPROACH, WE'RE NOT RELEASING DRUGS OR OUTSIDE FACTORS TO ACCELERATE HEALING. AND IT WORKS VERY WELL.\" The secret behind the bandage is laminin, a protein that sends signals to cells, encouraging them to differentiate, migrate and adhere to one another. Ameer's team identified a segment of laminin called A5G81 that is critical for the wound-healing process. Pictured: Stained epidermis cells cultured on the A5G81 peptide.

IntelliCare, devel- oped at Northwestern's Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies, includes a suite of programs aimed at depression and anxiety. Among other features, individuals who are depressed and likely to stay in bed all day might be prompted with \"goals\" to get out of bed, brush their teeth and eat something. \" As you check them off, you' re given harder things to accomplish,\" said Stephen Schueller , PhD, adjunct assistant professor of Preventive Medicine and one of the apps' developers. \"People really like being challenged.\"Northwestern Microbiome Project on Board SpaceX In June, a SpaceX rocket launched the first orbiting robot with artificial intel- ligence and other station supplies. Also on board are two sets of genetically identical brown female mice, or 20 mousetronauts alto- gether.

They did the same with former NASA astro- nauts and identical twins Scott and Mark Kelly, during Scott's yearlong space station mission a few years ago.From a Pediatrician, Lessons for Dads-to-Be In a conference room at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on a recent evening, a group of men sat down for a class on pregnancy and childbirth led by Craig Garfield, MD, associate professor of Pediatrics and Medical Social Sciences. Garfield has found that helping fathers benefits the children they raise \u2014 and that some of the health issues new moms face also affect new dads. He discovered that new fathers gain significant weight and that many experience a major increase in depressive symptoms, which could lead to them being neglectful of their children. He also found that fathers of prema- ture babies experience higher levels of stress than their partners during the transition home. Garfield has called for wider health screening in new and expectant fathers, many of whom do not have primary care physicians. Garfield is working on a pilot study expected to start in August to track health behaviors in new fathers. A Surprise Medical Solution: Hypnosis Hypnotherapy \u2014 when patients enter a trance- like state using relaxation and visual images \u2014 is often associated with alternative medicine. But increasingly medical centers are using it to treat digestive conditions like acid reflux, irrita-ble bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis. \"It doesn't get rid of the stimulus. Your GI tract is still moving. It's just changing the threshold of perception so you're not paying attention or feeling it with the same intensity,\" said John Pandolfino, MD, chief of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Northwestern Memorial Hospital started offering hypnotherapy in 2006 and has plans to expand to two regional hospitals. Because there aren't many treatments for IBS, hypnotherapy has become \"the front-line therapy,\" Pandolfino said.

Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicagohey happened to be in the same room discussing the same thing: inves- tigating curative therapies for beta thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder that causes severe anemia and requires lifelong blood transfusions for survival. That's how Alexis A. Thompson, MD, MPH, professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, recalls first meeting scientists from a small biotechnology startup called Bluebird Bio at a thalassemia conference six years ago. More than an exchange of business cards, though, this chance encounter evolved into an inter- national multicenter trial testing a promising gene therapy approach that may revolutionize the treatment of beta thalassemia and related blood diseases. The r esults of the collaboration were published earlier this year in a headline-mak- ing paper in The New England Journal of Medicine. The paper reported findings from an international gene therapy trial known as Northstar headed by Thompson, plus a separate, smaller study led by investigators in France. The two clinical studies evaluated a novel treatment strategy to replace the disease-causing gene \u2014 beta globin \u2014 respon- sible for beta thalassemia. When mutated, this gene impairs the ability of red blood cells to make normal amounts of hemoglobin. The phase I trials used a lentiviral vector manufac- tured by Bluebird Bio to deliver healthy copies of the beta globin gene into a patient's harvested stem cells. Following transplantation of their genetically modified stem cells, the majority of the studies' 22 participants no longer needed blood transfusions or required far fewer moving forward \u2014 a major breakthrough. S cientists have been working for decades to develop genetic modifications to effectively treat inherited human diseases. Hemoglobin disorders such as beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease have long been a focus of this gene therapy research. \"From the beginning, we recognized that if patients could produce enough normal hemoglobin, this approach could be transformative,\" says Thompson. Thompson is director of the Comprehensive Thalassemia Program at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, a member of the Stanley Manne Children's Research Insti- tute and president of the American Society of Hematology, the largest hematology organiza- tion in the world. \" As soon as it was feasible to initiate a phase I clinical trial, we seized the opportu- nity to take all of this wonderful basic science work and apply it to two conditions for which it was clearly ideal: thalassemia and sickle cell disease,\" she says. Seeking New Options An iron-binding protein in red blood cells (RBCs) called hemoglobin makes it possible for RBCs to transport oxygen and fuel cells throughout the body. Mutations in the gene for beta globin, an essential component of hemoglobin, adversely impact hemoglobin production: too little or none at all can deprive cells of oxygen and lead to fewer RBCs in general, usually causing anemia. The lives of individuals with the most severe form of \u00bb \"From the beginning, we recognized that if patients could produce enough normal hemoglobin, this approach could be transformative.\" ALEXIS A. THOMPSON, MD, MPH T16 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018thalassemia depend on blood transfusions every three to four weeks, usually starting before a patient is even one year old. With an estimated global prevalence of nearly 300,000, thalassemia is among the most common blood disorders in the world, affecting an estimated 60,000 infants each year. While lif e-sustaining, frequent trans- fusions can cause a buildup of excess iron. Patients then require iron chelation therapy to remove the iron and prevent damage to organs such as the heart and liver, as well as to lessen side effects like joint pain and fatigue. The only po tentially curative therapy available to patients with transfusion-depen- dent thalassemia has been allogeneic hemato- poietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) \u2014 receiving normal blood-forming stem cells from a genetically similar donor. But not every eligible patient has an appropriate donor, and even under ideal circumstances, problems can arise from these stem cell transplants, such as rejection of the donor cells. In one serious complication, graft versus host disease, donor cells attack healthy tissues and organs in the transplant recipient. Late effects including infertility, growth retardation and poor bone health must also be considered prior to pro- ceeding with HSCT. In general, young recipi-ents with a well-matched donor and minimal iron buildup achieve the best outcomes. \" There has been a real need to develop other definitive therapies for people who don't have sibling donors or who are older,\" says Thompson. \"The use of gene therapy represents decades of research to attempt to actually restore or replace a defective protein such as beta globin with a new source of that protein.\" Collect, Modify, Return Thompson and her colleagues at Lurie Children's and Feinberg sprang into action once animal studies successfully demonstrated gene therapy could correct beta thalassemia as well as sickle cell disease in mice. The inves- tigators participated in the early development of the clinical protocol that would be used for the Northstar study at sites in the United States, Australia and Thailand. The e xperimental gene therapy starts with a thorough evaluation of potential recip- ients to ensure adequate organ function and their understanding of the potential risks and benefits of the protocol. Then, study sites collect stem cells from patients' peripheral blood or blood stream via apheresis technol- ogy, which is less invasive than bone marrow harvest performed under general anesthesia. The cells are sent to a centralized U.S. manu- facturing laboratory for insertion of the new \"healthy\" beta globin gene into the abnormal stem cells. W ith the largest pediatric stem cell transplant and pediatric apheresis programs in Illinois, Lurie Children's is well suited to conduct this type of cutting-edge gene therapy research. The hospital's stem cell transplant team oversaw the management and care of close to half of the global study's participants. \"W e have a highly experienced group of transplant physicians and nurses, adept at col- lecting stem cells from patients with complex conditions,\" says Jennifer Schneiderman, MD, MS, '06, '07 GME, associate professor of Pediatrics and medical director of Lurie Children's Therapeutic Apheresis Program. \"Harvesting stem cells from thalassemia and sickle cell patients is not straightforward. Their red cells are not normally shaped, and the apheresis machine spins and separates them in a different fashion than what we typically see. Our expertise allows us to modify the equipment to obtain what we need.\" A fter six to eight weeks at the central processing laboratory, the reprogrammed stem cells are returned to the transplant centers. Patients return to the hospital where they first undergo a rigorous chemotherapy regimen before being reinfused with their gene-modified stem cells. They remain in the hospital for four to six weeks for the management of side effects. \" This therapy carries significant risks,\" says Schneiderman, a hematologist who spe- cializes in stem cell transplant. \"These patients were very brave to take this leap of faith and try this treatment.\" WHAT IS BETA THALASSEMIA? o Blood disease caused by inherited mutations in the gene beta globin, responsible for hemoglobin protein o R esults in shortage of red blood cells and lack of oxygen in many parts of the body, leading to serious complications such as organ damage and bone deformities o P atients need regular blood transfusions to survive o Wanda Sihanath (above), 22, first patient to receive therapy in 2014 o Z innia Jones (below), 13, received therapy in 2018MEET THE PATIENTS17 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG ILLUSTRATION BY MCKIBILLO Early Success At a median follow-up period of 26 months, the investigators found that 15 of the 22 patients, who were once transfusion- dependent, no longer required regular blood transfusions to survive. They also suffered no ill effects from the novel gene therapy. The remaining study partici- pants who didn't become transfusion-independent were able to reduce their need for transfusion by an average of 70 percent. Building on the findings f rom the initial Northstar study, Thompson's team has been working on phase II/III gene therapy With the largest pediatric stem cell transplant and pediatric apheresis programs in Illinois, Lurie Children's is well suited to conduct this type of cutting-edge gene therapy research. studies. Expanded to include sites in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Greece, these studies are focused on refining the gene therapy \u2014 better addressing the specific genetic subtypes of beta thalassemia and boost- ing the quantity of RBCs genetically modified by the lentiviral vector. For example, more participants with a geno- type called non-beta- zero thalassemia who received gene therapy became transfusion independent than those with genotype beta-zero thalassemia. Additionally, increasing the amount of \"healthy\" genes taken up by cells appears to enhance the body's ability to make adequate levels of normal hemoglobin. The results of these studies have prompted Lurie Children's investigators and others to begin evaluating the use of gene therapy to treat sickle cell disease, another inherited blood disorder. S ome have already begun calling gene therapy the definitive \"cure\" for thalassemia. While not ready to use that four-letter word, Thompson is no doubt thrilled by the early success of this innovative treatment for blood disorders. \"W e are incredibly gratified that every- one who participated has had clinical benefit, either the reduction or elimination of regular blood transfusions,\" she says. \"While we plan to follow these patients for a long time, I am very excited about the early stability of this treatment without serious side effects. We are absolutely headed in the right direction.\"1 2 3HOW DOES THE NEW THERAPY WORK? Patient Stem CellsModified Stem Cells Mutated Beta Globin VectorModified Stem CellsThe clinical trial included 22 patients with beta thalassemia from two studies. After undergoing the therapy, 15 patients no longer require regular blood transfusions to survive and seven patients reduced their need for future tranfusions by 70%.ur bodies are storytellers. Every heartbeat, joint creak and electric signal of a neuron tells a story of what is going right \u2014 and wrong \u2014 within the vast, complex system that gives us life. While w e now have the wearable technology to translate some of these stories \u2014 think Fitbits or health trackers on our smartphones \u2014 for bioelectronics pioneer John A. Rogers, PhD, and his colleagues, those devices only scratch the surface of what we can discern from the body in real time. R ogers, who joined Northwestern in 2016, develops electronic devices that can bend, stretch, twist and integrate within the human body to both diagnose and treat disease. As the Louis Simpson and Kimberly Querrey Professor of Materials Science and Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Neurological Surgery, Rogers conducts work that cuts across disciplines to translate innovative research into real medical breakthroughs. R ecently, Rogers became interested in developing a wearable patch that could record acoustics within the body, such as sounds within a joint or vibrations from speech. \"We asked ourselves if it would be possible to build a soft, wireless, skin-interfaced device with the form factor of a Band-Aid and the functions of a stethoscope to continuously and precisely measure the body's subtle mechanical and acoustic signatures?\" he says.New stretchable electronic patches could transform rehabilitation and long-term care.WRITTEN BY EMIL Y A YSHFORD Redefining WearableTechnology Listen to a podcast episode featuring Rogers at magazine.nm.org NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018 1819 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGtransform electronics from traditional rigid silicon circuits into soft, conforming, thin devices that integrate with the body while transmitting real-time information wirelessly to both physicians and machine-learning algo-rithms that can find new patterns within data. R ogers has also developed devices that can be worn on the body to measure sweat rate and chemistry or to quantify exposure to solar UV radiation, as well as devices that can be implanted within the body to harvest energy from organs and automatically treat abnormal heart conditions. S ometimes a device is developed for one purpose, only for investigators to find it has a second capacity. Rogers's group origi-nally developed the acoustic patch with the W ithin a short period of time, and through galvanizing Northwestern connections, what Rogers called an \"exploratory exercise in materials science and applied physics\" turned into a real diagnostic and treatment tool to measure a rehabilitating stroke patient's pat-terns of speech and swallowing. The result, the first wearable device designed for the throat, is a \"much more personalized, quantitative approach to rehabilitation,\" Rogers says. The pa tch is only the beginning. Together with Arun Jayaraman, PhD, associate professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and his lab in the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Rogers has developed sensors that are deployed across the body to give a comprehensive view of patient recovery. TRACKING SPEECH, WITH COMFORT The throat sensor is just one in a portfolio of innovations developed in Northwestern's Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics. There, Rogers and his collaborators have devel-oped materials and design approaches that idea that it might be useful for a new kind of human-computer interface, but they pivoted after being approached by Leora Cherney, PhD, professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Feinberg and a research scientist at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. She treats patients with aphasia, the loss of the ability to speak or understand speech after a stroke. She ask ed if perhaps Rogers's throat patch could measure patients' total talk time and the cadence of their speech, giving therapists a better way of tracking patients' rehabilitation.It could, Rogers said. \"The patch can track speech and speech patterns in a way that is completely immune to ambient noise,\" he says. The t eam quickly realized the device could also measure swallowing. Dysphagia \u2014 difficulty swallowing \u2014 is another potentially difficult act that affects stroke patients' quality of life. \"Once we understood that measuring speech and swallowing was important, we could go back and tailor the devices specifically to measure those processes,\" he says. \u00bb We want the technology to have widespread, positive societal impact. \"JOHN A.

Sleep Quality Step CountActivity DetectionArm UseHeart FunctionSwallowing Speech Sweat20 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018The project involved designing a flexible patch with a battery, radio and acoustic sensor that could stick to the soft part of the throat and, perhaps most importantly, be comfortable for the user. \" The patch had to be constructed so that people forget it's there once they put it on,\" Rogers says. \"We strive on the engineering and materials side to make it fully skin-like and physically imperceptible.\" Once the pa tch was optimized for patients with aphasia and dysphagia, Rogers's group looked to expand its platform with another Shirley Ryan AbilityLab investigator \u2014 one who, like Rogers, takes a multidisciplinary approach to solving problems. FULL-BODY PICTURE OF RECOVERY Arun Jayaraman's space in the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab is the picture of translational med-icine. The Max N\u00e4der Lab for Rehabilitation Technologies and Outcomes Research not only houses dozens of physical therapists, engineers, computer scientists, physicians and social psychologists, it also has machine shops for building new technologies and space for patients to test them out. The g roup develops and optimizes next-generation technologies for people with disabilities. In the case of stroke, \"early interventions are critical for long-term recov-ery,\" says Jayaraman, who is also a professor of Medical Social Sciences and of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences. His team works on more than 30 projects at a time, including prostheses, robotics and adaptive technologies. \"W ith every question you want to take a multidisciplinary approach,\" he says. \"Each discipline has a thought process on what might work. When you combine them, that's when you get the best outcome possible.\" Bef ore he met Rogers, Jayaraman tested new rehabilitative technologies \u2014 like a robotic leg that understands its user's intent and then bends and moves like a real leg \u2014 and tracked patients' responses with commercial sensors. But the sensor s were optimized for healthy people, so when a patient with a restricted gait or a Parkinson's tremor used them, the sensors couldn't account for the different movements, and the resulting data was incorrect. R ogers's innovative sensors made it possible to detect behaviors on new locations on the body, like the throat, but Jayaraman also wondered if Rogers could provide a suite of sensors to give a full-body picture of a stroke patient's recovery. W ith feedback from Jayaraman, Rogers expanded the platform to include full-body motion kinematics. This new suite of sensors could be placed at multiple locations on the body to measure heart function, sleep quality, physical activity and muscle contractions. Once patients are discharged, we want them to get to a level where they can get back to their lives, back to work. Now we have the ability to monitor them to ensure their rehabilitation is on the right track.\" THE SWEAT MONITOR The bio-integrated device, made up of five distinct layers, monitors sweat loss and analyzes sweat chemistry, useful for stroke patients whose sweat rate can vary from the left to the right side of their bodies. Its sensors wirelessly stream data to clinicians' phones and computers, allowing them to react to patients' changing metrics in real time.1 2 3 4 5 Lab on the Skin CHEMISTRY SUMMARY pH CHL ORIDE VIEW 30-DA Y HIST ORYGLUC OSELAC TATE 7 0 5 .37 .82 .5 mmol/Lmmol/L Wireless electronics Cover silicone Cover sensors Silicone microfluidic channel Adhesive layer21 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGIn the Max N\u00e4der Lab for Rehabilitation Technologies and Outcomes Research at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Arun Jayaraman has dozens of projects at the interface of rehabilitation and technology. Jayaraman could also deploy Rogers's sweat patch, which monitors sweat loss and analyzes sweat chemistry. This proves especially useful in stroke patients, whose sweat rate can vary from the left to the right side of their bodies. Ja yaraman's team is now developing algo- rithms to translate data from the sensors and is creating a dashboard interface for physicians and therapists to see how patients' data com-pares to that of healthy people. In the mean-time, his patients are trying out the sensors at home. \" They don't mind wearing them,\" he says. \"Once patients are discharged, we want them to get to a level where they can get back to their lives, back to work. Now we have the ability to monitor them to ensure their rehabilitation is on the right track.\" FUTURE OF LONG- TERM CARE Working with physician-scientists at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab has been key to making designs as useful as possible, Rogers says. \"Being co-located and tightly coupled makes a tremendous difference.\" H e hopes to continue improving the sensors while looking for more potential uses. \"Ultima tely we would like to think of our research with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab as a stepping stone to broader deployment,\" Rogers says. \"We want the technology to have wide-spread, positive societal impact.\" F or example, he's connecting with Northwestern Medicine speech pathologists to test the throat patch with their patients and working on a haptic interface that reminds people to swallow, moving the patch beyond diagnostics and into therapy. Ja yaraman, meanwhile, envisions Rogers's sensors as key to the future of long-term care, especially for the elderly, who could benefit from unobtrusive remote monitoring that could allow them to keep living in their own homes. This could be a large market, consider-ing the number of Americans ages 65 and over is projected to double to more than 98 million by 2060. \" The whole world is aging,\" Jayaraman says. \"If we are able to monitor the elderly at home, it could create a new care model.\"Increasing Mobility for Amputees and the Elderly PREVENTING INJURIES IN WHEELCHAIR USERS When a wheelchair user spins their chair's wheels with their arms, they run the risk of injury \u2014 either by grabbing and pushing the wheel incorrectly, or by using too much force. Jayaraman's lab is developing gloves with sensors that measure the force and movement a user deploys, thereby calculating how much damage their shoulder joints are potentially receiving. DETECTING AND SOFTENING FALLS For amputees, falls are an imminent threat to independence. The lab is developing a robotic leg prosthesis that can detect when a wearer has lost their balance. The leg then reacts by slowly lowering itself to a kneeling position. The lab is also working to soften inevitable falls by developing an airbag designed to be worn under the pants, like a pair of boxer shorts. When a wearer falls, the airbag would deploy, and the soft cushion would help prevent hip fractures. PHOTOGRAPHY COURTESY OF Shirley Ryan AbilityLab22 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018 Steadying the Symptoms of Parkinson's DiseaseImproving quality of life with leading-edge deep brain stimulation.MAGAZINE.NM.ORG 23 IMAGE BY John Bavosi/Science Source or patients with Parkinson's disease, even everyday tasks like brushing their teeth or signing their name can present signifi- cant challenges. Severe tremors, involuntary movements and other motor symptoms characteristic of Parkinson's often prevent patients' from carrying on their day-to-day activities, especially as the disease progresses and symptoms become more difficult to control. Within the Northwestern Medicine health system, an advanced surgical treatment called deep brain stimulation (DBS) is bringing a sense of control back to these patients. The remarkable procedure, which involves implanting an electrical system into a patient's brain to regulate the abnormal signaling in Parkinson's, may sound futuristic to those unfamil- iar with the treatment. In fact, DBS has been well-established over decades of use. And while the procedure does not cure Parkinson's or alter the underlying course of the disease, DBS can change lives by easing debilitating symptoms. Today, Northwestern Medicine hospitals are home to the busiest DBS program in the region, where a team of neurology specialists and an expert neuro- surgeon are at the forefront in using leading-edge DBS tech- niques to improve quality of life for patients with Parkinson's and other movement disorders, such as essential tremor and involuntary muscle contractions known as dystonia. \"W e've led the way in using advanced devices in DBS and advanced techniques in the operating room to facilitate surgeries,\" says Joshua Rosenow, MD, director of the Functional Neurosurgery and Epilepsy Surgery Program in the Department of Neurological Surgery. He performs the procedure at both Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital and Northwestern Memorial Hospital WRITTEN BY ANNA WILLIAMS (NMH), which is ranked #9 in the nation for its neurology and neurosurgery program. \"We're always looking to get better. We're always looking to optimize what we do and how we do it to help improve outcomes for patients.\" A Look Inside DBS Deep brain stimulation has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1997 for essential tremor and medication- resistant Parkinson's-related tremor. Still, many physicians believe that common misconceptions about DBS lead a large number of patients with Parkinson's \u2014 which occurs in 1 to 2 percent of people over the age of 60 \u2014 to miss out on potential treatment. \"If y ou ask movement disorders experts across the spectrum, I think we would all say that deep brain stimulation is still vastly underutilized,\" says Cindy Zadikoff, MD, associ- ate professor of Neurology in the Division of Movement Disorders, and a neurologist who manages DBS patients at NMH. \"Ev en today, there are still plenty of patients who see DBS as science fiction or as a last-ditch effort,\" agrees Rosenow, also a professor of Neurological Surgery, Neurology, and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. N ot everyone is a candidate for DBS. Before undergoing the procedure, patients with Parkinson's receive a thorough assess- ment and discuss potential benefits and risks with their neurologist. In g eneral, DBS is only considered for patients who have lived with Parkinson's for several years and experience significant symptom fluctuations throughout the day, despite optimal medical management. \"Deep br ain stimulation doesn't cure the diseases we are treating \u2014 and we spend \u00bb F24 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018a lot of time making sure patients understand that. But for Parkinson's disease, it does take them back to a time when their fluctuations were minimal, and we can reduce medication,\" explains Zadikoff, also an associate professor of Medical Education. \"Our goal is to allow patients to go back to doing the things they like to do, and used to do.\" During a DB S procedure, stimulating elec- trodes are implanted through a small opening in the skull into a specific area of the brain that controls movement (the exact location depends on the patient and his or her condi- tion). Part of the surgery is performed while patients are awake and responsive, which helps ensure that the correct areas are being stimulated. The electrodes are connected to an extension wire that runs under the skin behind the ear and down the neck to a small device implanted in the chest. That device \u2014 a neurostimulator akin to a pacemaker \u2014 sends electrical impulses through the wire to the electrodes to regulate abnormal signal- ing in the brain, restoring normal function to the patient. F inding the optimal target for stimula- tion is key. \"I kid with patients and students that neurology and real estate are all about the same thing: location, location, location,\" Zadikoff says. After the device has been prop- erly implanted, programming that takes place after surgery also helps achieve an optimal response. Neurologists like Zadikoff make adjustments to the neurostimulator settings as needed, and also work with patients on modifications they can make at home to increase effectiveness. F or some symptoms, the effect of DBS can be immediate. \"It really is just such a 'wow' moment,\" Zadikoff says, referring to the point during surgery or programming when tremors settle, and patients can pick up a pen or steadily hold a drink in their hand again. It can tak e longer for disorders like dysto- nia to respond to DBS, as well as other symp- toms of Parkinson's, such as bradykinesia (slow movement) and gait difficulty. And in general, DBS doesn't improve Parkinson's symptoms that didn't previously respond to medication. But f or many patients, the therapy's overall impact on quality of life is powerful \u2014 whether it's the newfound ability to leave a walker at home, decrease medication or return to hobbies and routines enjoyed before their diagnosis. \"Man y studies have now shown that DBS allows patients to reduce their medication and improve their quality of life,\" Zadikoff says. \" And when we simply ask patients, 'how much DEEP BRAIN STIMULA TION During the procedure, a neuro- surgeon places a thin wire lead through a small opening in the patient's skull 1 . Electrodes 2 at the end of the lead reach into a specific area of the brain. An extension wire 3 connects this system to a neurostimu- lator 4 implanted in the chest. Programmed and adjusted by a neurologist, the device sends electrical impulses to the electrodes to regulate abnormal signaling in the brain and control the patient's movement. \"Our goal is to allow patients to go back to doing the things they like to do, and used to do.\" CINDY ZADIKOFF, MD1 3 42 (TOP) ILLUSTRATION BY MCKIBILLO (RIGHT) IMAGE BY Alfred Pasieka /Science Source25 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGbetter do you think you are?,' they'll usually tell us somewhere between 70 to 90 percent. This therapy really gives a lot back to patients.\" Toward Better Outcomes in DBS Although DBS has been used for almost 30 years, the basic technology has remained largely the same over that time period \u2014 until recent years. Investigators at Northwestern and around the world are now helping to refine the technology behind DBS, with the ultimate goal of further improving outcomes for patients. Zadik off and Rosenow are both investi- gators in INTREPID, an ongoing randomized, double-blind clinical trial for a new device, called the Vercise DBS System, which delivers stimulation to the brain in a novel way. \"W e're able to stimulate areas in a more refined fashion,\" Zadikoff explains. \"The device is controlled by current, as opposed to voltage, which is a much more regulated and energy-efficient way of delivering this energy.\" One- year data from the trial, presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in April and the American Society for Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery meeting in June, demonstrated that the device is safe and effective in treating Parkinson's symptoms. Vercise is now FDA-approved. \"W e continue to be involved both on the local and national level in these sorts of studies to bring the most cut-ting-edge therapies to our patients,\" Rosenow says. He notes that Northwestern Medicine was also one of the first centers to use and validate certain advanced surgical techniques in DBS, such as interoperative CT scanning to inform placement. Michae l Rezak, MD, PhD, a longtime advocate of DBS who directs the deep brain stimulation program at Central DuPage Hospital, also recently received the Distinguished Physician Award from the Parkinson's Disease Research Society, which includes funding for research into movement disorders. He also serves on multiple national committees focused on DBS research. In the f uture, investigators will continue to study enhanced DBS systems and surgical techniques, as well as explore new targets for stimulation that might address symptoms DBS currently doesn't treat. There is also increasing research into the use of DBS in select cases of other disorders, such as epilepsy and obses- sive-compulsive disorder. \"I think that in the future, we are going to be seeing greater numbers of indications for DBS, particularly in the neuropsychiatric world,\" Zadikoff says. Of co urse, Northwestern investigators are also actively investigating a range of other therapies for movement disorders, to expand treatment options for patients who may not elect to undergo DBS. F or now, providers like Zadikoff, Rezak and Rosenow often say that working with patients with DBS remains one of the most rewarding aspects of their practice. \" Seeing the improvement in quality of life for these patients is really one of the most gratifying things we get as surgeons,\" Rosenow says. \"Knowing how we've helped preserve someone's quality of life and improve how they live every day \u2014 that makes it all worth it for us.\" \"Knowing how we've helped preserve some- one's quality of life... that makes it all worth it for us.\" JOSHUA ROSENOW, MD 26 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018 WRITTEN BY Nora Dunne PHOTOGRAPHY BY Teresa Crawford PROBLEM SOLVER Robert Kalb is moving Northwestern's Les Turner ALS Center forward. S Mutations in the C9ORF72 gene are the leading genetic cause of ALS. A product of the mutant gene (green) locates to the nucleus of motor neurons (red) where it inhibits the cellular trash disposal unit, nuclear proteasomes.ome of the facts we know about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) today: It causes neurons in the brain and spinal cord to degenerate, leading to muscle weakness and, eventually, paralysis. An estimated 20,000 or more Americans have the disease at a given time. Their average life expectancy after diagnosis is three to five years, though some may live much longer. What we don't know yet: what causes motor neurons to die, how to stop ALS from progressing and how to cure it. Despit e this grim reality, Robert Kalb, MD, is optimistic about the outlook for ALS. \" ALS is a very hard problem, but I think this is a great time in science to solve the problem,\" says Kalb, the inaugural director of the Les Turner ALS Research and Patient Center at Northwestern Medicine. When K alb was finishing medical school at Cornell University in the early 1980s, scientists and physicians were translating groundbreaking therapies for hypertension and cardiovascular disease, \"but it was a desert for neurology,\" Kalb says. \"I think that's what drew me to the specialty in the first place.\" K alb went on to complete an internship and residency in internal medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine's Montefiore Medical Center and then a residency and fellowship in neurology and neurobiology, respectively, at Yale New Haven Hospital. S oon after, he opened a laboratory at Yale, secured funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and began to focus on motor neuron development, studying rats who spent neonatal life at zero gravity on the Space Shuttle. Over time, his interest in motor neurons blossomed into an interest in motor neuron diseases. Today, he studies gene activation and misfolded proteins in familial ALS. \"N ever in the history of science have we had such powerful tools for understanding how genes are involved in normal cellular activities and what goes awry in disease states,\" Kalb says. \"When I see patients with ALS, I pinch myself and say, 'how could it possibly be that we don't have a cure for them?' I don't know when we'll have an answer for them, but I really think we can get there.\" TWO-FOLD MISSION Kalb arrived at Northwestern last December, after spending 15 years on the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Ev erything was terrific in Philadelphia, but moving to Northwestern seemed like a new adventure and a superb opportu- nity to make an impact on the lives of individuals with neurological diseases,\" he says. \"Now I have two missions: The first is to make 27 MAGAZINE.NM.ORG Listen to a podcast episode featuring Kalb at magazine.nm.org the Les Turner ALS Center, which is already great, even better. The second is to grow my own laboratory. There is really high-end basic science going on here, and I am excited about the opportunities for collaboration.\" A s director of the center, Kalb is responsible for aligning Northwestern's ALS research with its clinical activities, in partnership with the Les Turner ALS Foundation. \" One priority is to build the translational program so that when a discovery is made in the lab, it reaches patients more efficiently,\" he says. \"I think this role needed somebody who wears both the basic science hat and the clinical hat to make sure everybody's working together.\" K alb is also the Les Turner Professor and chief of Neuromuscular Disease in the Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology and a neurologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Lois Insolia ALS Clinic. \"Bob is a tho ughtful, creative clinician-scientist ideally suited to lead the Les Turner ALS Center during these excit- ing times,\" says Dimitri Krainc, MD, PhD, chair and Aaron Montgomery Ward Professor of Neurology. \"I'm confident he'll bring insights from basic science to the bedside to improve the lives of many patients with ALS.\" \u00bb\" WHEN I SEE P ATIENTS WITH ALS, I PINCH MYSELF AND SAY, 'HOW COULD IT POSSIBL Y BE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CURE FOR THEM?' I DON'T KNOW WHEN WE'LL HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THEM, BUT I REALL Y THINK WE CAN GET THERE.\"28 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018 ALS Discoveries from Feinberg Scientists Teepu Siddique, MD, is working to determine the causes of and treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those involving mitochondria and motor neuron function. His lab has identified genetic causes of ALS and engineered the first mouse model for ALS dementia. Pembe Hande Ozdinler, PhD, explores the mechanisms responsible for selective neuronal vulnerability and degeneration, focusing on upper motor neurons. Her group was the first to isolate these neurons in the brain that die in ALS and give them fluorescent tags so they can be tracked. Evangelos Kiskinis, PhD, uses neuronal subtypes derived from human stem cells to study the cells primarily affected in ALS. In a recent paper published in Cell Stem Cell , he showed how the process of DNA methylation regulates the development of spinal cord motor neurons. Kalb in his new laboratory at Feinberg, with postdoctoral fellow Patrick Riechers, PhD (left). Outside the Lab and Clinic Kalb says that a move to Northwestern would never have been possible without the support of his wife, Marianne Bernstein, an internationally recognized curator of site-specific art shows. They have two grown entrepreneurial sons, one living in San Diego and the other in New York City. Outside of work, Kalb enjoys running, cycling and swimming, as well as reading, especially about history, for pleasure. Above right: Neural progenitors cells differentiated from human embryonic stem cells, from the lab of Evangelos Kiskinis. BRICK BY BRICK In his own laboratory, Kalb started studying ALS in tissue cultures and microscopic worms called C. elegans. Though only about 10 percent of ALS cases are familial (inherited), he and members of his team focus on that version of the disease because they are able to recreate it in animal models by manipulating genes asso- ciated with familial ALS in humans. Then they explore the molecular mechanisms that go wrong during the disease and search for therapeutic targets that could help patients with any form of ALS. \"W e have leveraged the awesome power of the worm to discover new genes and new pathways involved in promoting survival in models of familial ALS,\" Kalb says. \"Now we've taken those findings back into rodent systems, and we are working to target pathways with drugs. Ongoing partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry will accelerate the translation of basic science observations into potential therapies.\" Thr ough the years, his group has found that dysfunctional energy metabolism contributes to neuron death in models of ALS and identified two biological pathways in cells that can be targeted to treat the disease. Curr ently, Kalb is interested in how cells' waste disposal systems may be connected to ALS. \" All cells, and motor neurons in particular, create lots of misfolded, or damaged, proteins that are noxious to cells if permitted to accumu- late in them,\" Kalb explains. \"So cells devote enormous resources to clearing that excess. I'm a strong believer that the underlying defect in all neurodegenerative diseases, and ALS in particular, is intimately tied to an inefficient trash disposal unit.\" Int erestingly, some scientists studying cancer are going after the same critical pathways. \"In f act, one reason cancer cells stay alive is because they're incredibly efficient at dealing with trash. The cancer guys want to block that. We in neuro-degenerative diseases have the opposite problem: We want to stimulate waste disposal,\" Kalb says. \"I think there's a chance that we might all meet in the middle somewhere with the same drugs.\" Despit e nearly 30 years of NIH funding and about 100 peer-reviewed publica- tions, Kalb says that his greatest accomplishment is training future scientists. \" Science is such a big, complicated edifice. Very few people in the end make the apex discovery,\" he says. \"I've made observations that are some of the bricks to build that edifice, but helping my graduate students and postdocs move their careers forward, that's what I'm most proud of.\" 29 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGAlumni President's Message ALUMNI TUp for Debate: IQ Versus EQ A letter from Jim Kelly, '73 MD Wher e I disagree with the article is the discussion of how to enhance emotional intelligence (EQ) in medicine. The authors espouse asking admissions committees to deemphasize cognitive IQ and increase the emphasis on EQ in the selection of medical students. They mention eliminating \"irrele- vant\" science requirements and emphasizing humanities-oriented programs in the selec- tion process. Part of this admissions process would be evaluation of EQ by using a relevant scored exam. I think tha t much of what the medical community values in self-awareness and EQ can be taught and learned at the medical student level. I do think that basic course work in these areas can be explicitly taught at the medical school and GME level with reasonable expectations of understanding and progressing through the material. Maybe even a series of webinars on the seven factors making up EQ \u2014 emotional stability, con- scientiousness, extraversion, ability emo- tional intelligence, cognitive ability, general self-efficiency and self-rated job performance \u2014 could be a requirement for students advanc- ing from M2 to M3 in all medical schools. M edicine at its highest level of perfor - mance requires both IQ and EQ. While we can do some things to raise general intelligence, I think we can do more to raise the level of emotional intelligence in our medical schools, thus avoiding the deselection of high-IQ students at the post-college level because they don't score well on a basic screening EQ test.here's a great quote from well-known golf champion Lee Trevino: \"The older I get, the better I used to be.\" After many years as a technical specialist in a surgical subspecialty, I could easily do a highlight tour of simple or complex procedures where an excellent technical operation resulted in a good outcome. But, I recognize that I do have selective memory loss when it comes to the occasional negative outcome as a result of an unfore- seen problem arising intraoperatively, usually in an emergency situation in which a technical approach did not foster a good outcome. And hence, I can always fall back on Lee Trevino's famous phrase. I r ecently read an article in the February 20th issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol 319, Number 7, pp 651-653) by Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, PhD, and Emily Gudbranson, both from the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, titled \"Does Medicine Overemphasize IQ?\" They discuss how everyone wants the best and smartest physician who attended the best medical school and trained in the best hospital system. Many times, these physicians had very high GPAs and MCAT scores in college. But, do these very intelligent students truly make the best physicians? The authors suggest that success in these metrics has little to do with social-emotional intelligence, which correlates much better with being an excellent clinical physician. A s GPAs and MCAT scores have risen over the past two decades, the identification of factors such as self-awareness and the ability to manage emo- tions and interact with others has helped fill out the equation of what constitutes a successful physician. Picture an oncologist's interaction with a critically ill patient or an ICU intensivist leading a multidis- ciplinary team of nurse practitioners, students and fellow MDs in a morbidity and mortality conference as two examples of the need for that \"other intelli- gence\" to expeditiously solve problems.Feinberg students participate in a four-year longitudinal course called Personal Transitions to the Profession, where they discuss the challenges of careers in medicine and how it may affect them personally and professionally. In small groups facilitated by a trained faculty member, they talk about topics such as perfectionism and dealing with failure and life balance. Students also engage in a mentored assessment portfolio review to reflect on their own performance data and identify areas of strength and self- improvement in competencies including effective communication and interpersonal skills. Students who leave Feinberg are equipped with the knowledge and skills to become outstanding reflective practitioners of medicine.

They went on tours of the hospitals and education buildings, attended seminars led by Feinberg faculty and visited Chicago attractions like the Museum of Contemporary Art and 875 North Michigan Avenue, formerly known as the John Hancock Center. \" There's definitely a sense of purple pride that brings people back,\" said Kavitha Gandhi, '98 MD, now a clinical instructor of Dermatology at Feinberg. \"I still teach here; I jump at every opportunity because it's fun for me to be back in the classroom, even if I'm on the other side of the lectern.\" On F riday morning, David Kerns, '68 MD, hosted a forum on his recently published novel, \"Fortnight on Maxwell Street.\" The book borrows heavily from Kerns' time at the Chicago Maternity Center, an obstetrics clinic on Chicago's West Side where many of the Class of '68 rotated to learn about childbirth. \" The neighborhood was a bustling center of immigrant activity, and you could hear live music every Saturday or Sunday \u2014 you also of course had the blues clubs,\" Kerns said. \"The novel captures a lot about the maternity center, but it's also about the neighborhood and the 1968 Chicago Riots.\" A fter the morning forums, current Feinberg students joined alumni for a men- toring lunch, where alumni were grouped There's definitely a sense of purple pride that brings people back.

He never had that opportunity.\" A s a psychology major, Skorton developed an interest in the effects of illness on people and considered a PhD program in psychology before opting to attend medical school. \"I decided I could focus on the psyche after becoming a phy - sician,\" he says. \"Once I got to Feinberg, I found it was quite a holistic education.\" Sk orton did an internship, residency and cardiology fellowship, which he finished in 1979, at the University of California-Los Angeles. But he'd always felt a pull toward both general medicine and the treatment of children and adolescents, so he focused on congenital heart disease as a staff physician at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, where he practiced from 1980 to 2006. While running an echocar - diography lab at the Iowa City V A Health Care System, Skorton also developed an interest in clinical computer image processing. Sk orton moved on to the administrative track as director of general internal medicine 1 3 2 5 4 6 1 Skorton delivering the convocation address to Feinberg's Class of 2018. 2 Holding Sandy Koufax's baseball glove. 3 Posing with friends from Star Wars outside of the National Museum of American History. 4 Performing with the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra. 5 Greeting President Obama at the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. 6 Unveiling the president and first lady's official portraits at the National Portrait Gallery.He played in a rhythm-and-blues band as a Northwestern undergraduate and dreamed of a career in music. But David Skorton, '74 MD, ended up staying at the university for medical school and becoming a cardiologist and university administrator, culminating with stints as president of both the University of Iowa and Cornell University. Then, three years ago, he was named secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. \"I33 MAGAZINE.NM.ORGProfile starting in 1985, eventually becoming president at Iowa from 2003 to 2006. \"I f ound medical training to be really good preparation for an administrative career,\" he says. \"Doctors are used to making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Physicians are taught to observe and listen first before coming to conclusions. When you're a physician, you gain big helpings of humility \u2014 patients do poorly at times, patients pass away at times.\" A t both Iowa and Cornell, where he was president from 2006 to 2015, Skorton says he always focused on the student experience. \"It's easy, when you become an upper-level administrator at a complex university, to spend time with everybody but the students \u2014 faculty, deans, department heads, other administrators,\" he says. \"No matter how important the research is, these institutions were developed to serve students.\" Sk orton's wife, Robin Davisson, PhD, a pro- fessor and scientist he met at Iowa, came up with creative ideas like holding a \"block party\" at the president's house and living with freshmen in the dorms during their orientation period. \"Those were gratifying experiences,\" he says. A t Cornell, Skorton worked to increase student financial aid to broaden economic diversity, and he focused closely on mental health issues \u2014 alcoholism, suicide, depression and the emotional aftermath of sexual and other assaults. \"I thought it was very important to do anything I could to reduce the stigma of mental disorders, so people would feel empowered to show up to access services,\" he says. Ano ther passion of Skorton's that he promoted during his university presidencies was the importance of the arts and human- ities. \"In an age that's become more and more STEM-centric, it's important not to ignore their intrinsic value or the integration of all those disciplines,\" he says. S erving as secretary of the Smithsonian has given Skorton further opportunities to explore his broader academic passions, although he was also motivated by something else his father \u2014 a naturalized citizen from what is now Belarus \u2014 said to him years ago. \"H e was a very patriotic American. He always inculcated in me the importance of voting and said if I had a chance to do something for the country, I should do it,\" he says. In the same w ay Skorton tried to bring down economic barriers to attending Cornell, he's inspired by the fact that the vast majority of the Smithsonian's offerings are free.

Sk orton's current role reminds him of leading a university for another reason: \"I get to learn all the time,\" he says. \"Yesterday at the National Museum of Natural History, I saw a recently discovered fossil of an early horse. That was amazing.\" In r etrospect, Skorton appreciates the academic challenges and student-centricity at Northwestern, which bestowed on him both an Alumni Merit Award in 2006 and a Distinguished Alumnus Award in 2009. He recalls that early in his first year at medical school, a family illness had become quite distracting, and he failed an important histology test at least partly as a result. \" The professor was incredibly under - standing \u2014 an exemplar of a superb professor,\" Skorton says. \"He took me under his wing, he personally tutored me and showed me his microscope slides. I've never forgotten the personal interest he had in me.\"34 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE SUMMER 2018ALUMNIGiving WRITTEN BY Andrea Arntsen-HarrisOrthopaedic Leader Honored By Trainees, Patients and Friends INTRODUCING THE MESULAM CNADC In May, the medical school announced it has raised $10 million to support the Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center (CNADC) and rename it the Mesulam CNADC in honor of its director, M.-Marsel Mesulam, MD, chief of Behavioral Neurology and the Ruth Dunbar Davee Professor of Neuroscience.

Today, he continues to provide important lead- ership to the department, as well as world-class care to his patients. The Michae l F . Schafer, MD, Fund was created to honor Schafer and recognize his innumerable contribu- tions to the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Northwestern. This year, thanks to the generosity and participation of current and former trainees, patients and friends, the Schafer Fund surpassed its endowment goal of $500,000 \u2014 one year ahead of schedule. Now the Schafer Fund will advance the research and training missions of the department in perpetuity. \"It w as a privilege and an honor to serve as chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery,\" said Schafer. \"I was fortunate to have a faculty that was dedicated to the educational mission of our residents. The success of the fundraising for this endowment ensures that our current and future residents will have the resources to enhance their educational pursuits.\" When describing their lo ve of Northwestern and strong connection to the department, supporters often cite their experi-ences as trainees under the able guidance and mentoring of Schafer. One is P atrick J. Sweeney, '88 MD, '93 GME, whose connection to Schafer extends even beyond their relationship as trainee and trainer. While a resident himself, Schafer trained under Patrick Sweeney's father, Howard J. Sweeney, '49, '51 MD, associate professor emeritus of Orthopaedic Surgery. Howard Sweeney served as Northwestern's team surgeon for 38 years and is included in the Northwestern Athletic Hall of Fame. \"Dr . Schafer and the entire staff and faculty of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Northwestern have been pivotal figures in my life. I am forever grateful for the privilege of training under them,\" said Patrick Sweeney. \"Dr. Schafer is a warm- hearted and gifted surgeon, physician and leader, to whom I credit much of my success and will forever be indebted.

Macaluso is a former Department of Medicine chief resident who now practices general internal medicine in the western suburbs. One year ago, her husband, Steve, was diagnosed with stage IV angiosarcoma. The N orthwestern Department of Medicine LadyCats, comprised of Diane Wayne, Elizabeth Wayne quickly formed, and alongside 146 additional runners, stormed the Naperville Women's Half Marathon & 5K to show support and raise awareness for angiosarcoma. A ccording to VanWagner, \"This experi- ence has instilled in all of us the importance of family, friends and, most importantly, the incredible unwavering spirit and support of the Northwestern alumni community. Once a Wildcat, always a Wildcat.\" 13 Aderonke Bamgbose Pederson, '15 MD, a third-year resident in Feinbergs Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, was selected for a Minority Fellowship Award funded by the American Psychiatric Association and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for her proposal: \"Examining mental health stigma among racial/ethnic minority populations within federally qualified health centers.\" Pederson will develop and implement inter-ventions that facilitate participation in mental health treatment and improve mental health outcomes within underserved communities of Chicago. Richard Adrian Greendyk, '17 MD, was recently awarded the 2018 John Loeb Intern of the Year Award at the Columbia University Department of Medicine. 14 15 13GME Robert Buckingham, '79 MD, announced his third book, Trafficking, published June 2018. He writes, \"The book tackles the problem of chronic interstitial space inflammation and how it blocks the capillary cell dance to disable capillary cell control of the feedback loop signaling system between all cells within the interstitial space. Once capillaries lose control of immune arsenal choreography, chronic inflammation will have sway on the interstitial space and dark outcomes will inevitably occur. White blood cells, cytokines, platelets and immunoglobulins will now listen to the beat of a different drummer as the interstitial spaces of different end organs become a harbinger for cancer, thrombosis, scarring, infections and autoimmune disease.\" 15 Rose Gomez, MD, '81 GME, was inducted into the American College of Psychiatry.

But that didn't bother Hahneman. \"I just thought medicine would be a good combination of my interests,\" she says. H ere, Hahneman talks to Northwestern Medicine magazine about the evolution of her career and why she has stayed involved with Northwestern all these years. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE IN MEDICAL SCHOOL LIKE? There were 128 in our class and only eight women. There was only the Ward building, and we shared that with the dental school. We had a very different curric- ulum than the students today. All we did our first semester was gross anatomy and micro- scopic anatomy. AFTER GRADUATION, YOU STA YED AT NORTHWESTERN FOR RESIDENCY AT WESLEY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (IT WAS AT 250 EAST SUPERIOR STREET, WHERE PRENTICE WOMEN'S HOSPITAL IS NOW). WHERE DID YOUR CAREER TAKE YOU NEXT? I went to Washington University in Saint Louis for a hematology fellowship, and then I came back to Chicago and practiced internal medicine and hematology at Wesley. After about 10 years, I went to a neighborhood health center in North Lawndale where I was head of the Department of Internal Medicine. Later I joined the staff at Mount Sinai Hospital, also on the West Side, and practiced there for about 15 years. After that, I moved with my husband to South Carolina, where the climate was better for his health. In 1989, I got my Master of Public Health degree at the University of South Carolina. WHY DID YOU PIVOT TO PUBLIC HEAL TH AFTER PRACTICING MEDICINE FOR 30-PLUS YEARS? I had developed an interest in population health and the way medicine was organized and practiced and programs that were or weren' t available to people who needed them. And South Carolina was a very interesting place to do that \u2014 so different from Chicago \u2014 with its small towns, many of which had been abandoned when the mills closed. I just found at that point in my life, I was more interested in what was going on in the world around me rather than going into an office and seeing one patient after another. HOW DID YOU END UP BACK AT NORTHWESTERN? After my husband died, I returned to Chicago. I talked to Philip Greenland, who was Northwestern's chairman of Preventive Medicine at the time. It was 1995 and they were just starting the Program in Public Health, so I got involved in its accred- itation. We always laughed at my title \u2014 I was \"associate director in charge of special projects\" \u2014 but it was very interesting work and I stayed until 2010, when I retired. Now I just do the fun things: attend the students' final presentations, go to graduations and reunions. I also have a new scholarship student, who is in the MD/ MPH program. I met him for the first time at Alumni Weekend. My previous scholarship student graduated last year. It's always fun to get together with the students to find out what's going on. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HA VE FOR YOUNG ALUMNI JUST STARTING THEIR CAREERS IN MEDICINE? It's difficult to give advice because medicine has changed so much, but I would say that it's important to continue learning. You should always be open to doing new and different things. You might find out you're interested in public health or another area quite different from where you started.IT'S DIFFICUL T TO GIVE ADVICE BECAUSE medicine has changed so much, but I would say that it's important to continue learning.

The spring issue describes efforts by Northwestern faculty to battle a \"new\" disease \u2014 AIDS \u2014 not only through activities in laboratories and clinics, but also in educating healthcare practitioners and members of the public across Illinois. \"Physicians wonder how we can work with AIDS patients when it's such a profoundly disturbing disease \u2014 it involves the terminally ill and it has negative moral implications,\" explained one faculty member quoted in the story. \"More people are needed who can approach this problem from a balanced point of view \u2014 and have a healthy respect for the individual.\" Another article celebrates the first babies born as a result of in vitro fertilization at Northwestern-affiliated hospitals. The fall issue, meanwhile, describes a press conference heralding a new innovation, lithotripsy to fragment gallstones, after \"the first procedure of its kind in Illinois\" was performed that June.T \"Kevin Hill is lucky to have four parents.
