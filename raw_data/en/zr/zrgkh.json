Research questions: What are the medical and experiential findings? Do we find medically remarkable and/or medically unexplained healings? Which explanatory frameworks can help us to understand the findings? Methods: 83 reported healings were investigated using medical files and patient narratives. An independent medical assessment team consisting of five medical consultants, representing different fields of medicine, evaluated the associated files of 27 selected cases. Fourteen of them received in-depth interviews. Instances of healing could be classified as 'medically remarkable' or 'medically unexplained'. Subsequent analysis was transdisciplinary, involving medical, experiential, theological and conceptual perspectives. Results: the diseases reported covered the entire medical spectrum. Eleven healings were evaluated as 'medically remarkable', while none were labelled as 'medically unexplained'. A pattern with recurrent characteristics emerged, whether the healings were deemed medically remarkable or not: instantaneity and unexpectedness of healing, often with emotional and physical manifestations and a sense of 'being overwhelmed'. The HP experiences were interpreted as acts of God, with a transformative impact. Positive effects on health and socio-religious quality of life persisted in most cases after a two and four year follow-up. Conclusions: the research team found it difficult to frame data in medical terms, especially the instantaneity and associated experiences in many healings. We need a broader, multi-perspective model to understand the findings. Horizontal epistemology, valuing both 'subjective' (experiential) and 'objective' data, may be helpful. An open dialogue between science and religion may help too. There is an analogy with healing narratives in the Bible and throughout church history. Future studies and documentation are needed to verify and clarify the pattern we found.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-03", "cleaned_text": "Prayer and Healing: A Study of 83 Healing Reports in the Netherlands [https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13111056](https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13111056) [Religion, Spirituality and Health]( /journal/religions/special_issues/spiritual_health )) ( [McCaffrey et al. 2004](#B41-religions-13-01056)). Despite secularization the topic still gains a lot of interest with people flocking to pilgrimage sites and prayer healing services. However, practices vary a lot. The setting can differ from distant, personal and group prayers, to visiting a prayer healing service or a pilgrimage site. There is also a variety of modes, such as anointing, laying on of hands, the use of a prayer cloth or taking a ritual bath ( [Brown 2012](#B9-religions-13-01056)). Whatever the setting or the mode, the intention remains the same: an appeal to God for healing of a disease. [Hakkenes 2009](#B23-religions-13-01056)). The healing sparked nationwide interest in the Netherlands and its aftermath led us to conduct this research. Other experiences and narratives as well as a lack of knowledge further motivated the authors to set up a study. [Roberts et al. 2009](#B48-religions-13-01056)). However, the performing of these studies involves considerable methodological and conceptual difficulties ( [De Aguiar et al. 2017](#B11-religions-13-01056); [Sloan and Ramakrishnan 2006](#B53-religions-13-01056)). It is difficult to set fixed background conditions for research on healing after prayer. For instance, friends, family, and members of religious congregations may be praying outside the context of the study. Others find it impossible to investigate prayer as if it were a drug or surgical intervention ( [J\u00f8rgensen et al. [Duffin](#B16-religions-13-01056)( [2013](#B16-religions-13-01056)) described a miraculous cure of acute myelogenous leukemia leading to the canonization of a saint at the Vatican. The Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) in the USA adopted a rigorous procedure to assess whether to consider a cure as unexplained or not, operating predominantly in circles of Pentecostal and charismatic Christians. Recently they published about two such cures, one of them from chronic gastroparesis since 16 years and the other one from juvenile macular degeneration blindness ( [Romez et al. 2019](#B49-religions-13-01056), [2021](#B50-religions-13-01056)). Still, it is an ongoing journey to publish about these cures as there may often be mistrust among church denominations and patients involved, causing reluctance to participate ( conducted by mode of semi-structured interviews with individuals who had experienced healing of different illnesses. Experiential and spiritual aspects accompanying the healings were investigated primarily. Reports mentioned sensory manifestations and extraordinary events such as visions or 'a transformational, powerful touch'. However, these studies focused more on experiential findings rather than medical data. [van Saane 2008](#B56-religions-13-01056); [Levin 1996](#B37-religions-13-01056)). It is beyond the scope of the introduction to reflect upon them extensively, but explanatory perspectives will be further discussed elsewhere in the article. [Kruijthoff et al. 2017](#B28-religions-13-01056)) to explore the following research questions: What do we find when viewing reports of prayer healing against a background of medical and experiential data? Do we find medically remarkable and/or medically unexplained cures? Which explanatory frameworks (multidisciplinary) can help us to understand the findings? [Abma and Stake 2014](#B2-religions-13-01056)). [Kruijthoff et al. 2017](#B28-religions-13-01056)), the other articles are mentioned elsewhere in the text to clarify the connection with this study. 2. Theoretical Background [Roberts et al. 2009](#B48-religions-13-01056)) we also found some observational and qualitative modes of research, combined with an overarching more philosophical perspective. [Helming](#B24-religions-13-01056)( [2011](#B24-religions-13-01056)), for instance, used Watson's concept of transpersonal caring theory in nursing as a theoretical framework ( [Watson 1999](#B57-religions-13-01056)). The term transpersonal acknowledges that individuals are a composite of mind, body and spirit (or soul). Love, faith, compassion, caring, community are as important to healing as conventional treatment methods. The underlying worldview emphasizes the fundamental inter-connectedness of everything that exists. [Austad et al.](#B5-religions-13-01056)( [2020](#B5-religions-13-01056)) conducted a qualitative study of extraordinary religious healing experiences in Norway. To understand participants' healing experiences, they used the concept of the 'lived body' as theoretical perspective. This idea is based on the philosophy of [Merleau-Ponty](#B42-religions-13-01056)( [1968](#B42-religions-13-01056)) who criticized the pervasive mind-body dualism in medicine and psychology and offered an alternative by viewing mental phenomena as fundamentally 'embodied' and bodily phenomena as expressing the tacit meaningfulness of the 'lived body' (the body subject). Medical treatment is not understood as 'fixing the machine', it addresses the lived body. Life experiences are inscribed in this body and may contribute to health or disease later in life. [Bendien et al.](#B8-religions-13-01056)( [2022](#B8-religions-13-01056)) use the term trans-somatic recovery in a qualitative study of prayer healing experiences. Trans suggest the presence of a transformative and transcending dimension in (some) healing experiences. It refers to aspects of healing that go beyond ('transcend') the duality of body and mind and include a spiritual ('transformative') dimension: an experience of improved wellbeing and a radical change due to an encounter with God, involving each aspect of life. [Abma 2020](#B1-religions-13-01056)). This type of research values scientific knowledge, but it gives equal weight to practical-professional (clinical) knowledge and existential-experiential knowledge developed by clients/patients (as 'experts by experience'). The broadening of horizons and greater understanding may be achieved through mutual dialogue and learning. This process of co-creation is difficult and meticulous but offers the promise of new and better understanding ( [Glas 2019](#B20-religions-13-01056)). 3. Methods [Kruijthoff et al. 2017](#B28-religions-13-01056)). The study took place between 2015 and 2020. 3.1. Recruitment, Initial Assessment and Selection - - - Likelihood when compared to the Lambertine criteria (outlined below). - - - Completeness of medical data. - - - Duration of healing to assess if a recovery is ongoing, in serious chronic diseases or malignancies preferably at least five years. - - - Healings before 1990 were excluded because of difficulty in finding medical data (there was one exception in this study). 3.2. Medical Assessment [Anonym 2011](#B3-religions-13-01056)). These are used by medical committees in Lourdes\u2014and elsewhere within the Roman Catholic Church\u2014to determine if a cure is scientifically unexplained ( [Duffin 2007](#B14-religions-13-01056)). - The disease has to be serious. - The disease is known under medical classifications, and the diagnosis should be correct. - It must be possible to verify the healing with reference to medical data, such as medical history, physical examination, laboratory and radiology investigations. - The cure cannot be explained by medical treatment in the past or present, nor by the natural course of the disease, such as spontaneous improvements or temporary remissions. - The cure is unexpected and instantaneous. Although the recovery may take some time, its onset should be instantaneous and related to prayer. - The cure is either complete or partial with substantial improvement. The individual is fully or largely returned to his or her original state of health. - The cure is permanent (by the scope of the study time). 3.3. Qualitative Research, In-Depth Interviews [Green and Thorogood 2018](#B21-religions-13-01056)). A topic list was used. The interviews were initially recorded and written out verbatim. Subsequently a report was made, which was verified with the patient by means of a member check ( [Koelsch 2013](#B27-religions-13-01056)). A phenomenological interpretative analysis ( [Smith 2011](#B54-religions-13-01056)) was completed by the senior researcher and discussed in the assessment team. Based upon the report and the discussion the assessment team re-evaluated their initial decision. 3.4. Level of Expectancy 3.5. Follow-Up 4. Results 4.1. Highlights [Table 1](#religions-13-01056-t001)reflects that we received 83 HP reports, of which 27 were selected for evaluation by the medical assessment team. In this group of 27 selected participants 14 in-depth interviews were conducted. Eventually eleven cases were considered to be 'medically remarkable'. None of them was evaluated as 'medically unexplained'. - Crohn's disease - Acute leukemia (temporary healing) - Chronic herpetic keratitis one eye with low vision - Iatrogenic aortic dissection - Psoriasis with chronic arthritis + ulcerative colitis - Multiple sclerosis - Anorexia nervosa - Parkinson's disease (90% healing, partial relapse after 8-9 years) - Drug induced hepatitis, Vanishing bile duct syndrome - Multimorbidity: severe asthma, impaired hearing, inflammatory osteo-arthritis, incontinence - Ulcerative colitis with debilitating diarrhea (40 times daily) 4.2. Results: Data Were Obtained 4](#religions-13-01056-t004)provide basic data: participant characteristics, reasons for limited data, origin of reports, and prayer 5](#religions-13-01056-t005)and [Figure 1](#religions-13-01056-f001)give information about the spectrum of all diseases reported while [Table 6](#religions-13-01056-t006)focuses on the 27 medical evaluations, including data about prayer setting during a healing experience and accompanying manifestations. Seventeen healings could not be labelled as medically remarkable/unexplained, the reasons are listed in [Table 7](#religions-13-01056-t007). In some cases mismatches were found between 'subjective' data', this is specified in [Table 8](#religions-13-01056-t008). [Table 9](#religions-13-01056-t009)reflects data about all reports, which were not evaluated by the assessment team. Data in this group provide us with information about instantaneity of healing, setting of the prayer(s) and accompanying manifestations. No medical conclusions can be drawn since they were not evaluated. The availability of medical data alternated. and expectancy. [Table 10](#religions-13-01056-t010)lists all reported manifestations including frequencies. A pattern of instantaneity of healing associated with physical and emotional manifestations was found to be dominant, which is reflected in [Table 11](#religions-13-01056-t011). This is true both for the subgroup of evaluated healings and for all reported healings. Levels of 'expectation to 12](#religions-13-01056-t012)and [Figure 2](#religions-13-01056-f002). [Table 13](#religions-13-01056-t013)reflects the explanations which the participants gave for their healings. 4.3. Results of Follow-Up in 2019 and 2021 4.4. A Secondary Result 5. Discussion 5.1. Major Observations - When evaluating 27 selected cases out of 83 prayer healing reports, a medical assessment team concluded there were 11 'medically remarkable healings', no 'unexplained healings'. - The study population was diverse. - Diseases reported covered the entire medical spectrum. - The setting of prayers varied considerably: personal prayers, group prayers, holy communion, - liturgical prayers, prayer healing services, anointing of the sick, these could all lead to healing experiences. - Healing experiences took place across all church denominations, and also when there was no church affiliation at all. - Healing experiences were often unexpected. Expectancy does not seem to play a major role. - A large majority of the participants reported an instantaneous onset of their healing, very often associated with physical and emotional manifestations at the same time. - Manifestations varied a lot, but in all cases they were sensed as being positive and meaningful. - Most healings had a multidimensional character, invariably interpreted as an act of God. Transforming people, often referred to as a healing of 'mind, body and soul'. - Due to the multidimensional aspects involved, the assessment team found it increasingly difficult to differentiate 'medically remarkable' from 'a remarkability in a broader sense'. - Pronounced mismatches were found repeatedly between 'subjective' data and 'objective' investigations. - In our follow-up the majority of the participants were still healed 2 and 4 years afterwards with a lasting positive effect on their socio-religious quality of life. It had often triggered a life of benevolence. - Participants were frequently confronted with negative reactions from outside, in particular from other Christians and from within their churches. - These observations will now be taken as point of departure for our further discussion. 5.2. The Research Population [Maselko and Kubzansky 2006](#B40-religions-13-01056); [Levin 2016](#B36-religions-13-01056)), there is some over-representation of females. [Table 4](#religions-13-01056-t004)reports came from multiple sources. Media coverage was from different sources such as newspapers, TV channels and social media, with varying ideological backgrounds (liberal, secular, orthodox Christian). 5.3. Spectrum of Diseases Reported [Table 5](#religions-13-01056-t005)). Psychiatric disorders were reported in 10 out of 83 cases. Apart from fibromyalgia, which was mentioned 6 times, illnesses of unspecified nature or possibly psychosomatic origin do not appear to be over-represented. [van Saane 2008](#B56-religions-13-01056)), who concluded in 2008 that in cases of prayer healing mainly psychosomatic disorders were involved. They did a questionnaire among 900 members of an Evangelical Christian broadcasting organization. Many of them apparently believed that God is able to heal through prayer. A subgroup of 81 reported actual healings. Reports of recovery were from depression, chronic fatigue, backache, headache, fibromyalgia et al. Predominantly illnesses with significant underlying psychological mechanisms, according to Van Saane. However, a list specifying diagnoses in the 81 cases was lacking in their book. [Duffin 2009, pp. 110-11](#B15-religions-13-01056)). All diseases were serious, often life threatening. Cancer was recorded 25 times. [van Saane 2008](#B56-religions-13-01056)), an advanced medical selection procedure (Duffin) or a request for positive prayer healing reports (ours). We should therefore be cautious when interpreting them. But one may say that both prayer requests as well as healing reports cover wide ranges of illnesses. 5.4. Modes of Presentation and Prayer Settings [Table 4](#religions-13-01056-t004)). This picture is distorted as 21 healings were reported by prayer healers themselves. We get a different impression when excluding them: in that case ten healings were reported during a prayer healing service, which is less prevalent than 'prayers by others' (20) and equally prevalent to 'personal prayer'(10). Other settings are common as well: anointing of the sick, prayers by the church community or by a group. 5.5. Level of Expectation vs. Explanation [Evers et al.](#B17-religions-13-01056)( [2014](#B17-religions-13-01056)) and a review by [Finniss et al.](#B18-religions-13-01056)( [2010](#B18-religions-13-01056)) concluded that physical complaints can be altered by placebo and nocebo effects due to induction of positive or negative expectations. This was demonstrated in different medical settings. [Table 12](#religions-13-01056-t012), [Figure 2](#religions-13-01056-f002)). This is in line with empirical research by Candy G Brown on HP in the US and Brazil, through written surveys and telephone interviews of people attending Pentecostal healing conferences. In her book 'Testing Prayer' ( [Brown 2012](#B9-religions-13-01056)) she concluded: 'Analysis of the available evidence suggests that, for both Brazilians and North Americans, faith and expectancy may be less significant in predicting healing than either Pentecostal or biomedical theories have supposed'. These results differ from our initial assumptions. They also contradict the view of some theological opinions emphasizing the degree of faith as a precondition for healing. [Bendien et al.](#B8-religions-13-01056)( [2022](#B8-religions-13-01056)) notice: 'at some point in their life they (i.e., the respondents) embark on a quest for faith, for their God'. One wonders about the association of these spiritual quests and the occurrence of a healing experience. Some of our participants, notably the ones with MS (EV14 [Table 6](#religions-13-01056-t006)) and aortic dissection (EV12 [Table 6](#religions-13-01056-t006)), had a heightened awareness of the relevance of prayer. There was increased prayer activity coinciding with the intention of visiting a healing service, when they experienced healing very unexpectedly. One of them experienced healing during an afternoon sleep, the other while doing a little job at home. At that specific moment there was no expectancy of healing at all, but they had embarked on a quest. Although the role of such spiritual journeys has not been clarified, it is interesting to take note of it for further investigation. 5.6. Course of Healing [Table 11](#religions-13-01056-t011)), this was emphasized even more when excluding those cases lacking sufficient data about the course of healing (61 out of 73). Gradual recovery, without instantaneous onset, was reported 12 times. [Table 11](#religions-13-01056-t011)) in the group of 61 instantaneous healing experiences. This fraction was even higher when excluding those without clear data about accompanying manifestations (43 out of 48). For those with gradual recovery and unknown course of healing (n = 23) eight participants reported manifestations. [Table 11](#religions-13-01056-t011)). [Fran\u00e7ois et al.](#B19-religions-13-01056)( [2014](#B19-religions-13-01056)), who studied 411 healings at the Lourdes pilgrimage site, France, from 1909-1914 as well as 25 cures acknowledged between 1947 and 1976. They concluded that 'in two out of three cases the clinical cure was instantaneous, sometimes heralded by an electric shock or pains and, more often, a perception of faintness, or of relief, or of well-being'. And Duffin, who investigated many healings in the Vatican archives, stated: 'The speed at which patients recovered occasioned many comments of astonishment. When asked if such a cure might have taken place naturally, the doctor would reply\u2014perhaps, but not so quickly' ( [Duffin 2009, and Smylyanich 2017](#B43-religions-13-01056)) as well as healings reported by St Augustine in his book the City of God in the 4th/5th centuries AD (see ref., [Augustine St. n.d.](#B4-religions-13-01056)) and Kathryn [Kuhlman](#B32-religions-13-01056)( [1992](#B32-religions-13-01056), [1993](#B33-religions-13-01056), [1999](#B34-religions-13-01056)) in the 20th century in North American prayer healing services. 5.7. Manifestations [Table 10](#religions-13-01056-t010)lists manifestations accompanying a healing experience during prayer. These occur frequently. Some of them, notably levitation and wind in a closed room, seem to be contradictory to physical laws. In two other cases it was surprising to understand that bystanders had experiences to some extent as well. [Poloma and Lee 2011](#B46-religions-13-01056)). All of them reported that they experienced a touch by God, manifested by different phenomena: a gust of wind, an appearance of Mother Mary, a 'hand' on the head or in the back, a vision of 'Angels' or 'a rainfall of liquid love'. But none of them described a simultaneous recovery of a disease. [Levin and Steele 2005](#B38-religions-13-01056)). Basic characteristics are ineffability, a sense of revelation (or 'a new sense of life'), positive moods and positive changes in attitudes and behavior. An agenda was proposed for research on the role of transcendent experiences in health. The frequently observed combination of healing with powerful experiences in our study seems to underline the necessity. Clarification and uniformity of terminology should be a starting point, as Levin and Steele indicated. 5.8. Medical Assessment [Table 6](#religions-13-01056-t006)). In 10 cases this was primarily associated with a highly unusual course of the disease: instantaneous healing experiences of serious diseases (Parkinson disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Anorexia Nervosa, Inflammatory Bowel Disease et al.) with gross reduction or complete disappearance of all symptoms. In one case there was a totally unexpected remission of acute leukemia in a terminally ill patient with major complications, which were considered to be incompatible with life. The assessment team could not explain this recovery. However, the relapse after one year did not comply with the requirement of a permanent cure (see Lambertini criteria under Methods). [Table 6](#religions-13-01056-t006)). In malignancies it may therefore be very difficult to find unexplained healings, as the vast majority of them also have parallel medical treatments. [Dowling 1984](#B13-religions-13-01056)), Rome the medical desk in Lourdes less than 1% of reports received since 1972 was evaluated as being unexplained ( [Fran\u00e7ois et al. 2014](#B19-religions-13-01056)). It is therefore understandable not to find such cases in our series of 83. 5.9. 'Mismatches' and 'Matches' [Table 6](#religions-13-01056-t006)). There is an interesting paradox here: in these instances 'subjective' data was better at reflecting the patient's state rather than 'objective' investigations. We recently published two articles covering some of these cases ( [Kruijthoff et al. 2021](#B29-religions-13-01056), [2022a](#B30-religions-13-01056)). In other cases (EV 3, 10, 11, 27, all in [Table 6](#religions-13-01056-t006)) we found matches as well: subjective recoveries were accompanied by measurable improvements. [Glas 2019](#B20-religions-13-01056)). Our cases considered here however, point us in a different direction where both 'objective' and 'subjective' data should be taken seriously and interpreted within their context. A horizontal epistemology (i.e., mode of knowing) would therefore better fit our findings. The term horizontal implies that objective and subjective data are both valued in the assessment of the clinical outcome ( [Abma 2020](#B1-religions-13-01056)). [Huber et al. 2016](#B25-religions-13-01056)), addressing people as 'more than their illness', covering six dimensions: bodily and mental functions, spiritual dimension, quality of life, social participation, daily functioning. A qualitative study and a survey were held under 140 and 1938 participants respectively. 'Patients considered all six dimensions as being almost equally important, thus preferring a broad concept of life, whereas physicians assessed health more narrowly and biomedically'. Is this part of the paradox we face? 5.10. Health Related and Socio-Religious Outcomes [Table 14](#religions-13-01056-t014)and [Table 15](#religions-13-01056-t015)). A large majority reported complete or partial healing when re-contacting them in 2019 and 2021, which was on average two and four years after registration in our study. [Lee et al. 2013](#B35-religions-13-01056)): 'An encounter with a divine energy that is profoundly loving and accepting beyond words, followed by a radical shift in which core values are turned upside down, resulting in insights that appear to rewire the person and their approach to life... It empowers a life of benevolence'. [Table 16](#religions-13-01056-t016)). Seventeen of them mentioned this explicitly during follow up. Evidently it is not rare. Corlien Doodkorte, who had a healing experience from Parkinson's disease (see also [Kruijthoff et al. 2021](#B29-religions-13-01056)), gave quite a few examples in her book ( [Doodkorte 2016](#B12-religions-13-01056)). It underlines the necessity that we should listen carefully to those having a healing experience without confronting them with our own opinions and it underlines the necessity for churches to develop a balanced view on healing and prayer. 5.11. A Pattern of a Healing Touch with a Spiritually Transformative Impact [Fran\u00e7ois et al.](#B19-religions-13-01056)( [2014](#B19-religions-13-01056)) was already mentioned above in Course of healing. [Austad et al.](#B5-religions-13-01056)( [2020](#B5-religions-13-01056)) in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 respondents with a healing experience related to prayer. They found similar sensory and extrasensory manifestations in a variety of settings and contexts, writing: 'In analyzing the participants' stories of what happened during their healing events, we found that these moments, in different ways, could be characterized as someone or something touching the lived body'. They also noticed that these powerful touches, 'hitting the target of the participants' burden', had a transformative impact on people's lives. Finally, they conclude: 'Based on the stories of these 25 participants, we argue that the experienced healing events, which we have characterized as involving the sense of a powerful touch that is targeted, energetic, emotional and love-providing, can be hermeneutically conceptualized as re-inscriptions that affected the lived body and spurred renewed health and lived meaning'. [Helming](#B24-religions-13-01056)( [2011](#B24-religions-13-01056)) did a qualitative study of HP. Twenty participants were interviewed: 'Sixteen of the 20 participants felt as though they had experienced spiritual transformation through this prayer and healing experience; they were not the same people thereafter'. [Bendien et al.](#B8-religions-13-01056)( [2022](#B8-religions-13-01056)). Further studies focusing on these findings will be very worthwhile. Is it indeed a recurring pattern? And what will be the relevance of it for churches and society as a whole? And for prayer practices specifically? 5.12. An Explanatory Framework [Kruijthoff et al. 2022b](#B31-religions-13-01056)). Moreover, most of the participants in our study had well established diagnoses explaining signs and symptoms. Also, can these healings be considered as spontaneous remissions of serious chronic diseases? Although a lot is still unknown about the nature and the causality of spontaneous remissions, as Radin pointed out, one would expect the clinical course of recovery to be more gradual as well ( [Radin 2021](#B47-religions-13-01056)). [Table 5](#religions-13-01056-t005)) in which there was psychosomatic illness. [Austad et al.](#B5-religions-13-01056)( [2020](#B5-religions-13-01056)) and [Helming](#B24-religions-13-01056)( [2011](#B24-religions-13-01056)) positioned HP experiences in a holistic perspective. Biological, psychological, spiritual aspects are all relevant. Body-mind duality and a subjective-objective hierarchy are not helpful when trying to understand participants. Collecting the medical files, which we did initially, was insufficient, as we observed that experiential and existential data were as important. [Table 13](#religions-13-01056-t013)). [Roukema 1989](#B51-religions-13-01056)), especially by Jesus, with the same 'ingredients' of instantaneity and transformation. These narratives are also about radical changes in life, turning-points after prayer and encounters with God. The same is true for accounts throughout church history ( [Paul 1997](#B45-religions-13-01056)) and today, a pattern which has been highlighted above in Course of healing. There is indeed an analogy between the HP experiences we observed and healing narratives in the Bible and throughout church history. They are being interpreted as a 'gift' or an 'act from God'. The word 'charism' is often used in the New Testament when referring to a 'gift of grace'. [Baumert](#B7-religions-13-01056)( [2001](#B7-religions-13-01056)), a German New Testament scholar, defines a charism as an act of God's Spirit in favor of the church or the world, working momentarily as a 'generous and unmerited bestowal'. This would indeed articulate very well the experience of many of the participants, irrespective of religious or non-religious background. [Barbour 2000](#B6-religions-13-01056)). Based upon our findings we would advocate a dialogue between them. The wisdom and narratives of religion and ancient civilizations and modern insights in science and clinical medicine may both be helpful when trying to understand HP experiences. [Gutierrez et al.](#B22-religions-13-01056)( [2018](#B22-religions-13-01056)) conducted a cross-faith study of life-changing religious and spiritual experiences in the US. Such experiences were also encountered in other religious and non-religious settings. Our study was about HP experiences in Christian settings, although there was a group of participants who considered themselves not religious prior to the prayer involved. Future research may include studies of HP experiences in other backgrounds as well. 5.13. Strengths and Limitations 6. Conclusions [Barbour 2000](#B6-religions-13-01056)). We may come across an interface between them, or a 'porosity' as we have called it elsewhere ( [Kruijthoff et al. 2022b](#B31-religions-13-01056)). Insights from medicine, biopsychosocial disciplines, theology and philosophy and good cooperation between them may all contribute to the dialogue.
