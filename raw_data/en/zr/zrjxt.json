It requires innovative thinking from people who thrive on passion for finding breakthrough ideas. Healthcare systems are undergoing rapid transformation that places new emphasis on population health, quality care, interprofessional col - laboration, and the value of services delivered. These changes present both opportunities and challenges for infection prevention and control programs and infection preventionists (IPs) as they assume expanded roles and new responsibilities. In light of these overarching changes to healthcare systems, the integral question to consider is how the IP role can be reimagined to better face these evolving needs. This past November, APIC hosted a consensus conference in Arlington, Virginia, entitled \"The Role of the Infection Preventionist in a Transformed Healthcare System: Meeting Healthcare Needs in the 21st Century.\" The keynote speaker, Dr. Steve Miller, senior vice president and chief medical officer of Express Scripts, began the confer - ence with a charge that, \"Infection preventionists have to be effective for everyone else in healthcare to be effective.\" The purpose of the consensus conference was to foster groundbreaking discussions that identify future possibilities and produce recommendations that will advance the value of the IP within the evolving healthcare system. Conferees were asked to anticipate trends and be proactive in devel - oping actionable strategies and recommendations that will position IPs for future success. National leaders within the field, and across the healthcare spectrum, evaluated and reached consensus on recom - mendations that reimagined the role of the IP. These recommendations focused on leadership roles and advancing strategies to support the IP's practice across the continuum of care. They also emphasized the value and financially beneficial nature of an enhanced IP role. This issue of Prevention Strategist provides an overview of the con - sensus conference methods; the future-oriented recommendations will be published in the American Journal of Infection Control . On behalf of the 2019 APIC Board of Directors, I want to acknowl - edge and thank the Consensus Conference Steering Committee\u2014Mary Lou Manning, Denise Murphy, Elizabeth Wallace, and Marc-Oliver Wright\u2014for their exceptional work to successfully meet the consen - sus conference goals. I am honored and inspired to be the 2019 APIC President. And, I look forward to working with the 2019 Board of Directors to use the consensus conference recommendations, in part, to create the APIC 2025 strategic plan.

APIC's nearly 16,000 members develop and direct infection prevention and control programs that save lives and improve the bottom line for healthcare facilities. APIC advances its mission through patient safety, education, implementation science, competencies and certification, advocacy, and data standardization. Visit us at www.apic. org. Visit us at www.apic.org . PUBLISHED MARCH 2019 API-Q0119 8120CEO'S MESSAGE IN MAY 2012, APIC published its first competency model for the infection preven - tionist (IP) as a tool for a more standardized developmental path for IPs. It outlined the interplay between core competencies established by the Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology (CBIC) to obtain certification in infection prevention and control (CIC\u00ae) as primary demonstration of core competency. This original model describes three career stages, with the CIC credential as the gateway between novice (early) and proficient (middle) stages. Equally important, the model has four future-oriented competency domains of future growth for the IP that radiate from the core. These are designed to elevate both the profession of infection prevention and control (IPC), and the professional. Keeping in mind that the competency model relevancy was envisioned at five years after publication, the APIC Professional Development Committee (PDC) recommended to the APIC Board of Directors to undertake a comprehensive revision throughout 2018. A Competency Model Revision Task Force was established and, with assistance from the PDC and APIC staff, completed a three-month phase of intensive research and information gathering. Seven subgroups were formed to identify emerging trends and capture key changes in the field since 2012. Future Trends Group\u2014analyzed emerging/future trends in IPC, both in and outside healthcare. Authors Group\u2014interviewed the original competency model authors. Committees/Survey Group\u2014surveyed key member groups. MegaSurvey Group\u2014reviewed that key study for issues pertaining to competencies. Healthcare Skills/Competencies Group\u2014performed an extensive review of the theoretical literature on skill acquisition, competency, and professional growth in healthcare, including reviewing competency models from other organizations. Advisors Group\u2014interviewed experts on technology and performance improvement. Practice Settings Group\u2014interviewed diverse practitioners working in long-term care, ambulatory, and other settings. The Task Force developed a prototype for the updated competency model in the spring and summer of 2018, then went through a several-month process of revising the new model based on stakeholder input and further discussion by the Task Force and PDC. Major elements of the original model have been retained. In May of this year, a revised interactive model will be launched on the APIC website, followed by a published paper in the June issue of the American Journal of Infection Control . APIC is excited to share this next evolution of the competency model with you and is grateful for the enormous efforts put forward by the Task Force, PDC, and staff in making this happen!

What better time to be in a profession that continues to gain momentum in ensuring patient and public safety throughout society. As the 2019 president of CBIC, I am thrilled to be part of this journey as we partner with current and new professional societies and organizations to advance the mission and vision of CBIC. I would like to thank Steve Langan, who rotated off the Board in 2018 after six years of service, as well as former CBIC president Jo Henman for her years of leadership and foresight on what is to come. I also would like to thank Joann Andrews for her leadership, which witnessed a clear framework on what needs to be done in the near and long-term future. Joann will assume the role of past president in 2019. Recently, I had an opportunity to attend a three-day high reliability organization (HRO) course that reviewed the various aspects of HROs and how they are implemented. The goal of the HRO is to make minimizing negative outcomes a constant reality through the implementation of various tools. The course went on to define healthcare delivery as a complex system where chain reactions can cause unpredictable events and thus putting safeguards in place can reduce harm significantly. This concept is applicable to the IPC profession and more specifically certification. I have listed several published studies that show the significance of certification. It is important that the certified infection preventionist is equipped with the knowledge to put necessary safeguards in place to reduce harm. With this in mind, the demand for certification is growing within the healthcare community. Several states have taken steps to consider legislation requiring certification for IPC, health systems are requiring certification as a condition of hire, and there is increasing interest from our international candidates to pursue certification. With this growing demand, CBIC is compelled to continuously evaluate how certification is developed and delivered while maintaining the vision and mission of the organization. CBIC is strategically approaching 2019 with renewed commitment to uphold the vision of the organization and establish new horizons as we advance in IPC together. I look forward to updating you all throughout 2019 on CBIC's strategic decisions. It's going to be an exciting year for all of us!

After undergrad, I took some time off to decide my next steps, and during that time I spoke with a counselor. She told me about a then-new program at the University of Florida offering graduate degrees in epidemiology under a Master of Public Health (MPH). At the time, I had no idea what epidemiology was. After doing some research, I knew this was what I wanted to pursue, as it would provide a great foundational background for any healthcare field I decided to progress into. What inspired you to become an IP? I heard a student who graduated in the class before me present his capstone A conversation with an MPH infection preventionist CHAZ RHONE, MPH, CIC INFECTION PREVENTIONISTTAMPA GENERAL HOSPITALTAMPA, FLORIDAproject centered around his infection prevention and control (IPC) internship. Learning about the practical application of epidemiology within the healthcare setting to solve problems and increase patient safety really got my attention, so I also completed an infection preventionist (IP) internship. I was instantly fascinated by the wide scope of an IP and all the opportunities to assist in improvements that directly impact patient outcomes. How long have you been an IP? I have been an IP for 11 years. In what ways has your MPH degree benefitted you and your facility? I was able to use the biostatistic skills that are foundational to the MPH degree to enhance the analysis and graphical presentation of the healthcare-associ - ated infection data for monthly report - ing to our COO and for the Infection Prevention Committee meetings. It has also assisted me in determining the best data points to collect for process improve - ment efforts and making decisions based on data. How do you see the MPH degree changing the IP field? MPHs are capable IP candidates who are primed and ready to walk into a facil - ity and hit the ground running due to the significant overlap of MPH foundational competencies with the knowledge and skills required for an IPC practice. As MPHs move into leadership roles, I think we will see even more movement toward formal quality improvement methodolo - gies to resolve IPC challenges, and more data-driven decisions to plan projects and prioritize resources. As a result of their formal education in some of the future- oriented domains of the APIC compe - tency model, I believe the impending IP shortage can be overcome by those who will progress through the APIC Competency Model quickly in order to fill the gaps of wisdom and expertise that may occur when many of the more sea - soned IPs begin to retire over the next 10 years. Why is having a CIC important to you? Obtaining the certification in infec - tion prevention and control (CIC) credential is important because it dem - onstrates proficiency in the core compe - tencies of IPC. Additionally, it ensures that all who are certified have the same foundational knowledge to practice IPC. Maintaining is just as important as it ensures that IPs keep their core skills sharp, especially as they move away from the day-to-day functions into leadership roles. When taking the recertification exam, I was challenged to review infor - mation that I do not use on a regular basis, so it refreshed my memory and reminded me of several resources that can assist in IPC practice. I have ben - efitted by demonstrating to colleagues and employers that I have proficiency in the core competencies of IPC. In turn, it has made me a more competitive can - didate and has also helped to negotiate a higher salary. What is the best advice you have ever received? The best advice I've received was to focus on leadership and communication skills, as they are critical to becoming successful in your career. This is also the best advice I can give to others. 20 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention CONSULTANT CORNER Consulting in ASCs KIM HAS BEEN an infection prevention - ist (IP) in academic and private hospital systems for more than 20 years.

This work led to her receiving APIC's 2012 Hero in Infection Prevention award. One of her favorite jobs has been teach - ing IPs, specifically being faculty for the APIC Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) Infection Prevention Course. 1 What do you like most about your work with ASCs? What I enjoy most about working with the ASCs staff is their passion and open - ness to do whatever it takes to care for their patients safely. They have a will - ingness to learn and improve process and outcomes as necessary. Being able to empower and support the IP in the ASC space while keeping patients safe is so important! ASCs are often in silos and may not have the resources needed to sustain an effective IPC program. By providing consultative services and ongoing educa - tion, whether it be face to face, webinars, or an onsite visit, this helps the resident IP keep up with the ever-changing land - scape of healthcare and infection pre - vention. The strengths of ASCs are that while somewhat siloed, the number of key stakeholders and decision makers is smaller, allowing ASCs to make decisions and implement critical patient safety and improvement measures faster than larger hospitals. 2 Please explain your onsite assessment work and system-level consulting support. This work is paramount to helping ASCs. There can be a lot of turnover in this space among staff and surgeons, and ever-changing infection prevention requirements can make sustainable pro - cesses hard to maintain. Having a con - tent expert consultant can help the center achieve, and maintain, best practices and patient safety. But, it isn't just bringing knowledge to the facility of breakthroughs or new thinking on a subject. Sometimes the advantages can be something as mun - dane as a new set of eyes. I remember one ASC where I walked in and noted something that clearly wouldn't allow the organization to get through a survey and nor was it particularly enhancing patient safety. I snapped a quick picture and showed it to the chief medical offi - cer. She saw nothing in the picture that looked wrong to her, until I pointed to the hand dryer installed over the surgical scrub sink. The IP walked by it hundreds of times and never saw it. Having an IPC consultant can help identify basic issues and some more complex ones. A CONVERSATION WITH KIM BOYTON-DELAHANTY, BSN, PHN, MBA/HCM, CIC, FAPIC 3 Describe common IPC challenges and concerns at ASCs. Among the challenges are the lack of knowledge of the current standards, regulations, and process improvement efforts. An IP may have access to the APIC Text and publications, and maybe even AORN's, but many don't have access to the AAMI standards or others. With an outside consultative service, these resources can be explained to the IP onsite. The lack of access to some of these standards can result in issues within the sterile processing department (SPD), like instrumentation not being decontami - nated properly, thus causing bio burden to dry on surfaces, making it difficult or impossible to sterilize the instrument. Or you may have overcrowded trays and peel packs, and not enough surgical instru - ments for the productivity of the center. The IP needs to be able to dedicate time to SPD by rounding regularly, randomly opening sterilized trays to insure efficacy of the sterilization process, and helping to identify potential issues. Development of the instrument recall process seems to be a gap and is not often standardized in many of the ASCs. Such failures can be disastrous to an ASC. Another concern in this space is unsafe medication management and injec - tion practices. The monitoring of this practice is often provider-specific and varied practices. Reuse of single dose vials, needles, syringes, and tubing is, unfortunately, seen too often, putting patients at risk for bloodborne pathogen exposure that can lead to death. Learning how to systematically and routinely identify such issues to prevent outbreaks is essential. www.apic.org | 21 4 What are the top three things that you like to see facilities do in their IPC departments? Programs can be built even with finite resources that can prevent nightmares such as outbreaks from happening. The top three things that I see in an effective IPC program is a culture of safety from the top down and vice versa. This means: use of the most current standards, recom - mendations, and regulatory requirements from professional organizations; not cut - ting corners for financial reasons; and having strategic organizational goals with outcomes that affect all healthcare work - ers, including surgeons' salaries. 5 What type of ambulatory client do you think would benefit from a consultant interim IP? I think all ASCs would benefit from an IP consultant; but those that would benefit most are: a brand-new ASC with a new IP physician-owned ASC not affiliated with a hospital system rural ASCs that don't have a lot of resources or bandwidth any ASC that has had a major patient safety infection prevention issue any ASC that does not have a resident IP. It can be very scary for a new IP who has just read something and thinks that their institution needs to make a change, but may not be confident that they read or interpreted the document correctly and is unclear how to institute change. Also, since IPs in the ASC don't deal with con - struction too often, we see a lot needing help during major repairs or renovation. 6 Have there been any onsite visits at facilities that have surprised you\u2014the good or the bad? Working in this space for more than 20 years, I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. I would say the centers that are productivity-driven without a cul - ture of safety philosophy are the biggest offenders of infection prevention and patient safety breaches. These centers are usually the ones in the newspaper. I have seen some really savvy IPs, but due to the organization's (lack of) priorities, they either move on to another ASC or completely leave the profession. When I am delivering ASC lectures, one of the things I ask is, \"How long have you been in this role?\" Most of the time, in a room of 40-100 people, almost all attendees have less than two years of experience, except those who come back to my class each year. When an organization is under the gun from regulatory agencies for breaches in IPC, it's the IP who gets chastised, yet that IP does not do patient care, insert catheters, or do surgery; they monitor the process, give evidence/science-based recommenda - tions for improvement, and monitor that improvement. This shift needs to change to sustain the IP workforce in ASCs. IPs are even more challenged in the ASC environment because outcome surveillance is so difficult to do and so easy to do incorrectly. 940470_Special.indd 1 1/4/19 12:15 PM22 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention CAPITOL COMMENTS WITH THE NEW year came a new Congress. The 116th Congress kicked off on January 3, 2019, and brings with it some new challenges, opportunities, and prospects for the year. Some challenges include a divided government, prolonged govern - ment shutdown, and an expiring budget deal. New opportunities include a large freshm an class o f legislators who are potential new advocates for infection pre - vention and control (IPC) and a chance to focus our advocacy on different issues in Congress. The 116th Congress con - sists of nearly 100 freshman legislators, which provides us with an enormous (but rewarding) task of educating new mem - bers on the role of infection preventionists and their importance in healthcare. DIVIDED GOVERNMENT The term \"divided government\" means the executive and legislative branches are being run by different political parties. In the 116th Congress, Democrats have the majority in the House of Representatives, while Republicans have the majority in the Senate and control the White House. While a divided government is common in the U.S., the government has been uni - fied under Republican leadership for the last two years. Although it can lead to legislative compromises, divided government also involves challenges. Both political parties have their own, quite different political priorities, which tend to be the focus of Congressional battles. In the 116th Congress, Senate Republicans are concen - trating on reducing regulations, exploring further tax reductions, and appointing federal judges who concur with their ideology. House Democrats will be focusing on campaign finance reform/Is there something different about 2019? BY RICH CAPPARELL, NANCY HAILPERN, AND LISA TOMLINSON, MA, CAE redistricting, healthcare issues (primar - ily around protecting the Affordable Care Act), and campaign investigations. Although these competing priorities helped lead to the government shutdown in December and January, it is worth not - ing that the current leaders of both parties were able to agree to increased funding for several departments that relate to IPC priorities for FY 2019.FY 2020 APPROPRIATIONS The president is expected to release his FY 2020 budget proposal in the spring, and it is likely to call for reduced spend - ing for many programs that are key to IPC. Most of APIC's priorities are funded under the Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations (see table). Although these programs gen - erally have bipartisan support, there is \"I continue to be interested in new things that seem old and old things that seem new.\" - Jaquelin T. RobertsonS.BORISOV/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM www.apic.org | 23 Antibiotic Pipeline\u2014The pipeline to develop new antibiotics is drying up. This means Congress will need to support new innovative approaches to encourage the creation of new antibi - otics, as bacteria does not take a break from becoming more resistant; Conditions of Participation (CoPs)\u2014 The Medicare infection control CoP for hospitals has largely remained unchanged since the 1980s. In 2016 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed a revision of the hospital CoPs that expands the role of IPC and requires implementation of an antibiotic stewardship program, but it has not yet been finalized and time is running out. Although Congress does not have authority to update the CoPs, legislators can encourage CMS to final - ize the proposed rule. This Congress will provide some chal - lenges, but it will also provide a plethora of opportunities for APIC and its members to have their voices heard.

Find out more about these resources at www.apic.org/imavip .expected to be some pressure to reduce spending this coming fiscal year. For FY 2018 and FY 2019, funding for IPC programs either remained flat or received small increases. This was largely due to a deal between the president and Congress on budget allocations for FY 2018-2019 that essentially allowed Congress to increase federal spending for those two fiscal years. That deal has now expired, and federal deficits are expected to be $1 trillion a year, causing concerns for members in both political parties. This could mean flat funding or even cuts to many programs through - out the government. This atmosphere will make it even more important for APIC members to respond to calls to action, because, as the saying goes, \"If you are not at the table, you are likely on the menu.\" NEW AREAS OF FOCUS Although this will be a challenging environment for legislation, it will not be an impossible one. For instance, spring is when Congress and the presi - dent usually start working on appro - priations for the next fiscal year, which begins October 1. However, for the past few years, Congress has missed its funding deadlines and found itself still debating current year funding bills while also planning appropriations for the next fiscal year. The rushed atmo - sphere around missed deadlines and continuing resolutions to keep the government funded until passage of the appropriations bills complicated APIC's advocacy efforts around how to fund IPC programs and limited advocacy on other topics. Since FY 2019 healthcare funding legislation was completed early in the fiscal year, in spring 2019, Congress will be able to focus solely on the next fiscal year, and the less rushed environment could provide new opportunities. Some topics that could use more attention include: Antibiotic Stewardship/Resistance\u2014 For the past few Congresses, sena - tors have introduced legislation to strengthen the federal response to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance; APIC Federal Infection Prevention Priorities Fiscal Year 201 9 (figures are in millions of dollars )24 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONPIC and the CDC have collabo - rated to develop tools to amplify infection prevention and control (IPC) programs in the actual settings where care is being delivered. These newly published tools are called quick obser - vation tools (QUOTs), and are intended to be simple, quick, infection prevention checks. QUOTs are an array of simple question - naires, designed to be answered in approxi - mately 10 minutes or less. Although these tools may be used by infection preventionists (IPs), the intended users are frontline care providers, which is part of an effort to make infection prevention everyone's business. Most IPs recognize that current policies, educational programs, and audits are nec - essary, but not sufficient for assuring day- to-day consistent compliance. QUOTs can be part of a full implementation strategy as they can strengthen IPC in an ongoing manner. Because they are quick and intui - tive, healthcare personnel throughout the facility can complete a QUOT each day or week, as assigned. As they do so, they are empowered to view the care environment to detect infection risks and to correct them. QUOTs add to other evaluation tools, including audits and Infection Control Assessment Tools (ICARs). While ICARs are performed to evaluate an IPC program, QUOTs look at the immediate readiness on a particular unit or for a particular patient population\u2014in real time, at the point of care. The ICAR asks if the program is appro - priate. The QUOT asks if the program is being implemented well today, on this unit, for this patient. QUOTs, now available on APIC's web - site ( apic.org/QUOTs ), can be printed and Quick observation tools: Empowering everyone in healthcare to prevent infections distributed for individual units or focused on particular aspects of care. The sets address a variety of locations of different patient care unit types or different elements of care. For example, there are sets for intensive care units, med-surg units, neonatal units, post- anesthesia care units, ambulatory care units, and departments that perform high-level disinfection. The sets can also be focused on an aspect of prevention, such as central line- associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) prevention, catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention, standard precautions, or transmission-based isolation. The IP, quality director, or unit manage - ment can select the QUOTs that are most appropriate for their own setting. Ideally, the QUOTs would then become a regular part of routine departmental pro - cesses. Typically, a unit may assign each worker to perform one QUOT per day or week, and the QUOTs would be ran - domly selected so that an array of situations would be reviewed. Think of QUOTs as \"CHANCE\" cards in a Monopoly game. In this way, workers on the unit would check prevention readiness and easily make cor - rections if needed. For example, QUOTs about CAUTI prevention ask the worker to observe urinary catheter placement for up to four patients. While the ICAR asks if there is a policy, training, and auditing about catheter placement, the QUOT asks the worker to observe if a particular patient's catheter is properly secured, is there unob - structed flow, is the collection bag below the level of the bladder, and is the bag and tubing off of the floor. The questions are very specific, but also very quick and easy to observe.

The policies and educational programs are reinforced in quick checks performed throughout the year by all workers in the area. If a unit is working on a particular IPC issue, the IP or departmental manager can require that QUOTs focused on that prob - lem are performed more regularly or by more workers than the usual random assignment. The array of QUOTs are grouped in 20 sets on the website, but sets can be altered to stress an improvement goal or be removed if the questions are not applicable to a par - ticular setting. Some facilities have appended the APIC-produced sets to add questions that are of special concern in their setting. The QUOTs page on the APIC website also has an EXCEL summary worksheet which may serve as a template for analyzing the ongoing readiness or progress in remediation when needed. As IPC becomes ever more demanding and complex, QUOTs may represent a sim - ple tool to increase engagement and help sustain program goals.

She received her Bachelor of Science in nursing from the University of Connecticut and a Master of Public Health from Johns Hopkins University. After serving more than three decades as the director of infection control at the MedStar Washington Hospital in Washington, DC, she now works part-time as an infection pre - vention consultant.

She sees \"no significant difference\" in the conclusion, and she's tempted to move on\u2014but she also spots \"strategies to improve power.\" Hmm. She reads on...FROM DATA TO DECISIONS Power BY CHRISTINA BRONSON-LOWE, P hD, CCC-SLP, CLD, AND DANIEL BRONSON-LOWE, P hD, CIC, FAPIC The authors collected data on duration of IUC usage for one month before and one month after implementing a daily IUC usage review. They hypothesized that the daily reminder to nurses would decrease mean duration of catheter usage. Data were col - lected on four hospital units: intensive care, telemetry, surgical, and inpatient rehab. Mean and standard deviation of catheter usage duration decreased from 8.6 \u00b1 4.0 days before intervention to 5.2 \u00b1 2.4 days afterwards ( p = 0.08). This p -value is not statisti - cally significant, per the authors' criterion ( = 0.05). The authors argue for further research. To evaluate their argument, we must understand statistical power. Imagine searching for something in a large, cluttered, dark attic when your flashlight is dim and you're busy: you'll shine the light quickly around a few obvious places. If you don't find the item, you can't conclude that it truly isn't there. You'll rehash why you thought it was in the attic in the first place. If those reasons still seem plausible, you'll put more resources into a thorough search later; otherwise, you'll search elsewhere instead. Imagine that next you bring good lighting and spend a week searching every box. You still don't find the item. Regardless of how convinced you were that it ought to be there, you have to give up on your theory and conclude it really isn't. Each time you need something in your attic, you choose your search strategy, balancing the limited resources available for the search against the importance of a negative result being meaningful. Usually, you need the item enough to justify more effort than the minimum described above, but not enough to justify the maximum. That's the idea behind statistical power: If the item is in the attic (the difference suggested by the alternative hypothesis [there is a significant difference between populations being compared] does exist), what's the chance of finding it (correctly rejecting the null hypothesis [no significant difference between populations being compared])? Researchers try to avoid the dim-flashlight scenario, as a very underpowered study risks wasting resources: They'd be unlikely to find the desired result, yet unable to conclude much from the failure to find it. In the check-every-box scenario (a high-powered study) if the alternative hypothesis is correct, there's a high chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. In that case, failure to reject the null hypothesis suggests that the alternative hypothesis is wrong: You KAPRALCEV/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM Welcome to article 12 in a series examining statistical concepts relevant to infection prevention. A26 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION searched the attic really thoroughly, but didn't find your item, so you have to reconsider. That is, the lack of significant findings can have important implications. So why wouldn't researchers simply always plan studies with 99% power? Planning a study is a balancing act. There are multiple ways to increase a study's power (making it easier to find statistical signifi - cance), but each is limited in applicability or has associated costs. In recognition of these limitations, adequate power is often defined as an 80% chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. (This leaves a 20%, or 1 in 5, chance of incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis\u2014a false negative. You don't know whether the item is in the attic, but if it is, \"adequate\" power for your flashlight would give you an 80% chance of finding it. Ninety-nine percent power, assuming the item is there, would give you a 99% chance of finding it and a 1% chance of failing to find it.) Researchers can: 1 Change the intervention to create a bigger difference between groups. For instance, the poster authors could require docu - mented justification for continuing catheter use. Drawbacks: Changing the intervention could be costly or impractical, and it changes the meaning of the study by examining something different. 2 Reduce variation within the compared groups, by using more homogeneous groups or by controlling the testing circumstances more tightly. However, the more restrictions on patient recruit - ment, the harder it is to obtain an adequate sample size, and tight experimental control may be difficult to achieve in a clini - cal environment. Both homogeneous patient groups and tight experimental control may also make results less generalizable. 3 Increase sample size. This is easy to say but may be hard to do. Finding and recruiting additional research participants can be time-consuming, expensive, or otherwise difficult, particularly if studying a rare condition or if there are other barriers to participation. 4 Raise , the criterion for significance. If the poster authors had used =0.10, p=0.08 would have been a significant result. However, if you make it easier to correctly reject the null hypoth - esis, you also make it easier to incorrectly reject it. You decrease the risk of a false negative at the cost of increasing the risk of a false positive. 5 Make the research hypothesis directional. Our poster authors have already done this: They hypothesized that their interven - tion would decrease mean duration of catheter usage, not merely make an unspecified difference. This strategy is only applicable if the theory supports that kind of hypothesis. 6 Use a different statistical test. Only appropriate in some cir - cumstances; statistical tests must match the hypothesis and study design. The authors of our example poster argue that their study was underpowered, and that therefore the correct path is to conduct a more powerful study rather than to discard or change their hypoth - esis. How can the IP evaluate their argument? She decides that their case for why their intervention should have the proposed effect is reasonable. She notes that restricting the study to one unit and collecting data for long enough to increase sample size are both plausible options. The p -value from the reported study, while not significant, was very close to significance; only a small decrease in the groups' variation would be needed to make a similarly-sized group difference significant. So, the authors' argument is probably reasonable. The IP makes a mental note to keep an eye out for their poster at next year's conference.

Study A was conducted across all units of a hospital which draws patients from two American states and across a national border. Its authors hypothesized that their ASP would change rates of antibiotic prescription, but failed to find a difference based on 132 patients pre-ASP and 237 patients post-ASP. Study B included all NICU patients in the biggest facility in a large city. Its authors hypothesized that their ASP would lower rates of antibiotic prescription, and they did find a statistically significant difference based on 1107 patients pre-ASP and 1309 patients post-ASP. These results seem to conflict. Which is more likely correct? Why?Study B had several characteristics suggesting higher power: their patients were more homogeneous (in age and geographic background, and possibly in characteristics for which these may be proxies, such as diagnosis and socioeconomic status); their sample size was larger; and their hypothesis was directional, allowing a directional statistical test. Study A's negative result, based on a highly heterogeneous and smaller patient sample and a non-directional hypothesis, is less credible.AnswerPREVENTION IN ACTIONwww.apic.org | 27 Focus on long-term care and behavioral health outbreaks: Identify the pathogen! HOSPITAL OUTBREAKS ARE reported more often in the medical literature than occurrences in the long-term care (LTC) or behavioral health setting. By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, infection preventionists (IP) will glean additional knowledge and apply this infor - mation to hopefully prevent future infections, and infection clusters, in their facility. This quarterly column will assist the IP with heightening awareness of appropriate interventions for preventing an outbreak. BY STEVEN SCHWEON, RN, MPH, MSN, CIC, HEM, FSHEA, FAPIC JARUN ONTAKRAI/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMCroker et al reported a 2018 outbreak occurring among four residents of a mental hospital in Los Angeles County.1 This facility cared for patients requiring long-term con - servatorship or short-term acute- care psychiatric treatment. Signs and symptoms associated with the four cases, on this 45-patient locked patient care unit, included vomiting, lethargy, and jaundice. Based upon your clinical acumen, you suspect the following pathogen: 1. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 2. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3. Norovirus 4. Varicella virus Laboratory results revealed elevated liver functioning tests and positive HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. The investigators note the index case (patient A), became ill three weeks after arriving at the mental hospital from a San Diego hospital, where his HAV exposure \"likely occurred.1\" The three secondary cases, two males and one female, occurred due to shared liv - ing quarters and a hospital unit restroom with patient A. The department of public health (DPH) officials identified substan - dard cleaning practices, cleaning solutions improperly diluted, and poorly maintained patient restrooms. Additional challenges confronting the DPH team included: gathering health information from patients who are poor historians and/or with limited verbal abilities. working with patients who are challenged in maintaining basic hygiene practices (i.e., one patient engaged in pica while a second patient exhibited fecal smearing). The DPH implemented prevention and control measures, including: providing a single hepatitis A vaccine to susceptible patients (94 percent compli - ance) and staff (44 percent compliance). focusing on enhanced environmental cleaning. closing the unit to new admissions and common day areas. performing vigilant surveillance for addi - tional cases. The outbreak was limited to the four cases due to the multiple DPH actions and the unit was eventually re-opened for admissions. It's noteworthy that none of the staff became ill. Hepatitis A rates in the United States have declined by more than 95 percent since the vaccine first became available in 1995; an increase in 2016 cases was attributed to imported foods. 2 In concert with this outbreak occurring in Los Angeles County, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) 28 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION Table 1: California hepatitis A cases as of April 12, 2018.3 Jurisdiction Cases Hospitalizations Deaths San Diego 587 402 20 Santa Cruz 76 33 1 Los Angeles 12 8 0 Monterey 12 10 0 Other 17 8 0 Total 704 461 21notes the California HAV outbreak first occurring in San Diego County in November 2016 and spreading to other counties, including Los Angeles County.3 At risk individuals included \"persons experiencing homelessness and/or using illicit drugs in settings of limited sanitation. 3\" The CDPH acknowledged the efforts of multiple stakeholders with promoting the hepatitis A vaccine to those individuals at risk. Infection with HAV can result in liver impairment and short-term damage. This highly contagious infection can result in a mild illness lasting a few weeks, to a severe illness lasting several months.2 Mortality is rare. Transmission occurs2: through virus ingestion of fecal-contam - inated objects, food, or drinks from an infected person. traveling to another country with endemic HAV transmission. having personal contact with infected individuals. from men who have sex with men. through injection drug use. Individuals at increased risk for con - tracting hepatitis A include:2 people with direct contact with someone who has hepatitis A. travelers to countries where hepatitis a is common. men who have sexual contact with men. people who use drugs, both injection and non-injection drugs. household members or caregivers of a recent adoptee from countries where hepatitis a is common. people with clotting factor disorders, such as hemophilia. people working with nonhuman primates. Symptom onset can be abrupt and include 2: fever fatigue loss of appetite nausea vomiting abdominal pain dark urine clay-colored stools joint pain jaundice Symptoms start appearing four weeks after exposure, with a range from 15-50 days.2 Virus transmission can occur up to two weeks before symptom onset. The illness period is typically less than two months. Once infected, hepatitis IgG antibodies will provide lifelong protection. Take home messages 1 Become familiar with the CDC's hepatitis A page. 2 Hand hygiene plays a role with preventing transmission. Discuss in community meeting with the patients, the importance of hand hygiene after using the bathroom and before preparing and eating food. Consider developing a patient hand hygiene program at mealtime. Also promote hand hygiene information to key health care personnel, i.e., dietary workers. 3 Follow local and state health department advisories addressing increased pathogen activity in your geographical area. 4 Review the merits of implementing an environmental hygiene performance improvement program with either ATP (adenosine triphosphate) or fluorescent gel markers. 5 The HAV can survive outside the body for months. Check with your facility's disinfectant manufacturer and confirm in writing to determine if the product is effective against HAV. 6 The CDC does not recommend routine hepatitis A vaccination for food service workers and healthcare workers.2 7 Partner with your facility's clinical laboratory and department of health to elucidate the hepatitis A infection reporting process. Graph 1: Incidence of HAV CDCwww.apic.org | 29 The hepatitis A diagnosis is based on the symptoms, and either jaundice or an elevated serum aminotransferase levels\u2014an enzyme found in liver and kidney cells. In addition, a positive serologic test for IgM antibody to the HAV will confirm the diagnosis and eliminate the hepatitis B and C viruses as alternative, possible causes for the hepa - titis. Also, in lieu of serological testing, a person who has an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed case and meets the clinical case definition will also confirm the diagnosis.2 Acute HAV infection is a nationally notifiable condition.5 Hepatitis A vaccine is the best approach to prevent infection.2 The number and fre - quency of the vaccine depends upon the vaccine type; refer to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) immunization schedule, which is updated annually and as needed, for additional infor - mation, including healthcare personnel spe - cific guidance. After a hepatitis A exposure, immune globulin or hepatitis A vaccine is administered within a two week window for effective post-exposure prophylaxis.2Standard Precautions are used when caring for a patient with hepatitis A; use Standard and Contact Precautions for incontinent patients over 14 years of age for 1 week after the onset of symptoms. 4 References 1.

Am J Infect Control, Vol. 46, | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONSpeaking in the simplest of terms, knowl - edge is stored within one of two types of long- term memory: declarative (\"knowing\") and procedural (\"doing\"). Declarative knowledge is the ability to name things, or recall facts , and can be easily articulated. Procedural knowledge is the ability to perform tasks, and articulation is difficult.2 For a sterile technician to demonstrate competency, they must possess both declarative and procedural knowledge, but there are different methods for teaching the two types of knowledge. MEETING THE ACCREDITATION STANDARDS In the U.S., the definitive standards out - lining sterile processing procedures and their related requirements are jointly devel - oped by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Though these standards are volun - tary, once a healthcare organization adopts them through policy, they must follow them. Accreditation surveyors usually review adherence to the standards during a survey and will cite any number of potential defi - ciencies related to sterile processing. Indeed, failure to follow ANSI/AAMI standards regarding sterile processing education and training is a routinely cited deficiency. ANSI/AAMI ST79:2017, Comprehensive guide to steam sterilization and sterility assur - ance in healthcare facilities , provides guide - lines for personnel qualifications, training, and education, which are typically adopted by most healthcare facilities who re-process critical instruments. As such, most acute care facilities require sterilization techs to be certified prior to hiring, or they are required to achieve certification within two years, as recommended by ST79.3 Some facilities, however, including many outpatient clinics operating only bench top sterilizers, may not have a certification requirement at all. This practice is still in accordance with ST79 because the requirements are contained within \" should\" statements, not \"shall\" Teach them well: Educating sterilization techs toward competency BY GARY CARTER, MPH, CIC, CIH, REHS, DAAS s you all probably know, sterile processing of reusable surgical instruments is of utmost importance in the control of infection among patients. Infections attributed to sterilization failures are well-documented in the scientific literature; therefore, the requirement for sterilization technicians to demonstrate compe- tence is absolute.1 Even without the occurrence of infection, a mere breach of sterilization protocol is considered a serious incident, especially when large numbers of instruments or devices are affected. Therefore, we must teach sterilization techs using adult learning theories and methods that are effective at transferring knowledge.WELCOME TO THE first installment of the Accreditation Focus series. Over the course of 2019, we will present columns discussing recurring infection prevention and control (IPC) challenges during accreditation surveys. Each installment will provide ideas, tips, and guidance on common IPC challenges and how to address them. statements, since ANSI/AAMI standards are consensus standards and not regulations. ST79 states: \"The responsibility for sterile processing should be assigned to qualified individuals who have demonstrated competence [emphasis added] in all aspects of sterile pro - cessing, including biohazard transportation, decontamination, preparation, packaging, sterilization, sterile storage, and distribution of sterile medical devices.\" They go on to state that \"Qualifications\" include demonstrated knowledge and documented competence in topics specified in the standard. This dem - onstration of knowledge and competency is required at regular intervals, usually annually. As for education and training, ST79 requires three levels of education: 1) an ini - tial orientation; 2) continuing education at regular intervals; and 3) in-service training. All three of these levels could be performed by personnel working for the organization\u2014and often are\u2014especially in outpatient clinics and smaller hospitals. This begs the question: Are people training their sterilization technicians AACCREDITATION FOCUS SERIESwww.apic.org | 33 Table 1.

That is, are they ensuring transfer of knowledge and competency using well- known adult learning theories and methods? Maybe. But to confidently approach a re- accreditation survey, and more importantly, to optimize patient safety, this answer should be: definitely. LEARNING TRANSFER/ ADULT LEARNING So, how does one go about ensuring learning transfer so that the learner can demonstrate knowledge and competency? Adult learning is a complex and fascinating field of study that draws greatly from cog - nitive psychology. There have been exten - sively researched theories over decades on the subject, resulting in considerable scientific evidence to guide one in conducting effec - tive training. As stated earlier, declarative knowledge is that knowledge that allows people to \"know\" information. For example, reciting the steps for sterilizing reusable medical instruments: removal of gross soil, transporting, cleaning, wrapping, sterilizer operation, and so on. On the other hand, procedural knowledge allows people to \"do,\" or perform, things, such as measuring correct ratios of enzymatic clean - ers or properly wrapping instruments (see Table 1). Let's use riding a bicycle as another example of the differences between declara - tive and procedural knowledge. Declarative knowledge is being able to name the parts of a bicycle; procedural knowledge is being able to ride one. We can train someone for hours \"Even without the occurrence of infection, a mere breach of sterilization protocol is considered a serious incident, especially when large numbers of instruments or devices are affected.\"34 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONusing PowerPoint-based lecture, but they would not likely be able to actually ride the bicycle after this type of training alone. The only way to teach procedural knowledge is through direct, hands-on training followed by practice . Clearly, it is neces - sary to learn declarative knowledge first, especially for sterile processing, but hands-on learning and practice are essential for procedural knowledge transfer so a sterilization tech can perform the task. While there are volumes of literature describ - ing how best to teach procedural knowledge, the following offers a very basic method for training sterilization techs on the sterilization procedure: 1Chunking or All-At-Once: Decide whether you will use \"chunking\" or teach the entire procedure all at once. Chunking is dividing the entire process into \"chunks\" of activities.2 For instance, there could be the following chunks: 1) point-of-use gross cleaning and transporting; 2) pre-cleaning and cleaning; 3) wrapping and packaging; and 5) storing. 2Teach Declarative Knowledge: Whether chunking or teaching the entire procedure, begin with teaching the facts, principles, and con - cepts\u2014this is the declarative knowledge. 3Hands-On Learning and Practice: After teaching declarative knowledge, the instruc - tor must make sure the learner has access to the equipment they are going to use, or at least something closely related, to effectively learn procedures. Have the learner access the equip - ment and walk through the steps. After either proceeding, through each chunk or the entire procedure, provide the learner time to practice on the equipment. Important Note: Have a subject matter expert close-by to answer ques - tions and observe that no errors get incorporated into the procedure. A highly useful tool to help the learner perform the procedures correctly, and to have as a continu - ous reminder, is a \"Job Aid.\" A Job Aid can be a sign, worksheet, or other written device that includes flow diagrams and other instructions to help the sterilization tech remember how to cor - rectly and consistently perform the tasks. 2 To ensure successful accreditation scrutiny of a facility's sterilization processes and proce - dures, sterilization techs must be taught with the correct type of instruction methods, so they can demonstrate competency and knowledge. Remember, these fundamental concepts are of utmost importance when considering training methods for a learning transfer.

SUBSCRIBE TODAY: apic.org/ATO 950830_Editorial.indd 1 2/5/19 2:04 PM36 | PREVENTION IN ACTIONBY RYAN ROZINKA, CRCST, CHL Forty-six percent of infection preventionists (IPs) view insufficient disinfection of medical tools and devices as a big barrier to prevent - ing healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).1 Yet very few healthcare systems have a dedicated IP in the sterile processing department (SPD).Partnering with the SPD to reduce HAIs instrumentation is often sent into surgery before a central service professional (CSP) has verified the BI result, increasing patient risk of HAIs. While advancements in BIs have made it possible to obtain a readout in as fast as 30 minutes or less, gaining buy-in for new practices and products is often a barrier for the SPD to adopting new technologies. However, IPs have the power to help enhance patient safety in a department that's on the front lines of infection prevention. Once IPs are knowledgeable about the SPD's role and hurdles to adoption, they can help improve processes, which then help keep their facil - ity's patients safe from infection. PRODUCTS AND BARRIERS As a non-revenue generating department, the SPD typically has a challenging time gaining buy-in from senior leadership when looking at new products. But taking steps to help reduce the risk of an HAI before an instrument is even used on a patient is criti - cal to reducing infection rates. The IPs can help assess if the SPD has the appropriate equipment to clean and sterilize the instruments. Before introducing a new product, the IP can assist in evaluating the potential impact on patients if adopted. Or on the flip side, they can help prove the value of the new product\u2014breaking down the barriers\u2014by showing how it can help reduce the risk of infections, and ulti - mately help reduce costs while improving patient care. IMPROVE AND IMPLEMENT PROCESSES Having the right products and technolo - gies are only one piece of the puzzle; they aren't enough if they are not being used properly every time. There are a number of guidelines and recommended practices out there on sterilization. In fact, sterilization processes are often very intricate, and include multiple steps and require focused attention. Unfortunately, there are often inconsistent That is starting to change. The SPD follows manufacturer's instruc - tions for use to decontaminate, clean, and sterilize instruments before the instruments are used again. So, while the SPD doesn't have direct patient contact, almost every patient admitted to a healthcare system comes in contact with the instruments they process. Given the risks of inadequate cleaning, decontamination, or sterilization of reusable devices, some health systems are making the SPD one of the first lines of defense against infection. IPS' GROWING ROLE IN THE SPD The ideal situation for infection preven - tion and control (IPC) within the SPD\u2014and one in which IPs can help make a reality\u2014would be to have biological indicators (BIs) used on every load. These load monitor - ing tools ensure lethality of a sterilization cycle, but not every department is able to fulfill it. Some SPDs aren't supplied with the latest technology to enable the fastest possible BI readout. On top of that, most SPDs are under pressure to keep up with operating room scheduling demands, which makes holding instruments in the SPD for hours or even days to wait for a BI result simply not possible. This means surgical www.apic.org | 37 processes applied from load to load, increas - ing the chance of error. For example, leading industry guidelines and standards promote the use of a BI in every vaporized hydrogen peroxide ster - ilization cycle.2 However, some facilities only follow part of the recommendation and use them only on certain loads. Two common hurdles I have seen to implement - ing BIs in every load are the historically long readout times and the cost. Thus, it creates an inefficient workflow and opens the door for potential error when there isn't a consistent monitoring method for each load. Also, it can increase risk to patients as a load can be unintentionally released into surgery before the SPD confirms it was properly sterilized. CLOSE THE GAP IPs play an important role in reducing HAIs across their healthcare system. Not only can they assess new technologies that make it possible to monitor every load, but IPs can evaluate the risks associated with a non-sterile device escaping, thus showing the cost to treat a surgical site infection versus the cost to implement the latest technology. This is even more important as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has changed its guidelines for reimbursement of HAIs. 3 By partnering with the SPD and gaining a better understanding of their role in patient safety, IPs can aid in ensuring compliance with industry guidelines and recommenda - tions, thus closing the gap and raising the standard of care.

Through the one-year pro - gram, the hospital system was able to offer on-the-job training, assess the interns' performance, and grow its staff.Innovative Program expands IP workforce BY MELANIE PADGETT POWERSINFECTION PREVENTION LEADERSHIP In 2014, three hospitals in Scottsdale merged with two hospitals in Phoenix to become HonorHealth. As part of the merger, the quality department was rede - signed and given four new IP positions. However, because the team had trouble finding experienced IPs for the job, Stephanie Jackson, MD, FHM, HonorHealth senior vice president and chief quality officer, suggested creating an internship program to fill at least two of the new positions. Dr. Jackson's pas - sion for infection prevention and control (IPC) was fundamental to bringing this program to fruition. Luckily, the rest of the organization realized the need for additional staffing support that would be developed. The overall goal of the internship program is to develop independent IPs who would be eligible to receive their certification in infection prevention and control (CIC\u00ae). \"We wanted to give them one year of intern training and experience, and then allow them to move directly to an independent infection preventionist role or position,\" said Patty Gray, BAHSA, RN, CIC, FAPIC, who has since retired from her role as HonorHealth network director of infection prevention and control. \"Additionally, we realized that they would still need another year before they might feel comfortable going for certification.\" \"The alternative would be to hire someone with little to no experience who would get on-the-job training without an established program or curriculum,\" said Lynn Carosella, MA, BSN, RN, CIC, an IP and intern preceptor at HonorHealth. \"That is a very pressure-filled situ - ation,\" Carosella said, \"because they have to learn, but then they have the responsibility. So, in this way, they're under someone's wing. They're learn - ing, and they could respond to the sim - pler situations as they felt comfortable with them.\" For example, the interns learned to conduct surveillance for healthcare- associated infections (HAIs) according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions by com - pleting the NHSN HAI modules, and then working side-by-side with their IP A \"Overall, it was a great and unique expe - rience,\" said Marshall, who is preparing for his CIC exam. \"I feel that many organiza - tions just place someone in the role either full or part time and they are expected to learn it, so it was nice to have a planned-out learning experience.\" Ragar appreciated that HonorHealth was willing to train her on the job. \"I wanted to be an infection preventionist but was stuck in the catch-22 that to qualify for an infection preventionist position, I needed to have one year of infection prevention experience,\" she said. \"The internship allowed me to gain experience in infec - tion prevention to qualify for an infection preventionist role.\"www.apic.org | 39 preceptor to identify an HAI. As the interns pro - gressed toward the end of their internship, they identified HAIs on their own and received case confirmation from their preceptor and the rest of the IPC team as needed. THE HUNT BEGINS The intern search got underway in 2016. The team wanted to hire registered nurses, or allied health professionals, who had at least one year of experience at an acute care hospital. Gray knew the intern salaries would need to be competitive with the candidates' current roles to be able to attract quality applicants. Developing a job description, appropriate sal - ary, and position listings required the IPC leader - ship to work with HonorHealth's human resources department. \"We had not done anything like that before,\" Gray said. \"We went through the human resource application process and the salary evalua - tion process. And that was a very important piece.\" The job description was the same as an IP but with the addition of \"under the guidance and direction of an independent infection prevention - ist.\" The IPC team fully vetted the applicants. Candidates were interviewed by a subsection of Tasks, knowledge, skills, abilities, and resources to take an infection preventionist from day 1 on the job through passing the Certification in Infection Prevention and Control (CIC) exam.\"Two interns were hired, and two of the existing IPs served as preceptors to each of the interns. Because the interns were from an allied health background and not RNs, the IPC team identified the need to be sure sufficient clinical exposure opportunities were provided for them.\"the IPC team. \"We tried to have the same IPC team members interviewing so that there was consistency in what we were looking for in the candidate,\" Gray said. Two interns were hired, and two of the exist - ing IPs served as preceptors to each of the interns. Because the interns were from an allied health background and not RNs, the IPC team identi - fied the need to be sure sufficient clinical exposure opportunities were provided for them. Additionally, the team needed to be sure the same opportunities were being provided for both interns since they were at two different facilities within the organization and had different preceptors. Training was developed from APIC's Roadmap for the Novice Infection Preventionist . The Novice Roadmap establishes all the knowledge, skills, and abilities that an IP must gain, guiding the person from the first day on the job through taking the CIC exam. Under the guidance of their preceptor, the interns performed regular IPC duties: learning surveillance for HAIs; learning communicable disease identification and reporting; institut - ing isolation practices; educating staff, students and volunteers; participating in performance 40 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONREAD MORE ABOUT INNOVATIVE INFECTION CONTROL PROGRAMS IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL Technological innovations in infec - tion control: A rapid review of the acceptance of behavior monitoring systems and their contribution to the improvement of hand hygiene.

In addition to standard IPC duties, the interns were sent to various clinical depart - ments to gain hands-on experience. They also completed APIC and NHSN learning modules. One of HonorHealth's accreditors pointed out that the department should keep hard copies of the interns' NHSN training verifications in their file to show accreditors proof of surveillance training. The interns also took part in special proj - ects. For example, they created and provided an educational program about personal pro - tective equipment and isolation precautions to a group of high school students interested in medical careers. The addition of the staff allowed the department to focus more attention on various projects, which helped lead to an improvement in the hospital system's HAI rates. The program also helped increase the IPC team's visibility to hospital executives. \"They began to understand the difficulty involved in hiring qualified IPs, as well as the benefit of training our own staff,\" Gray said. TIPS TO CREATE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM HonorHealth's team pointed out a few les - sons learned in their first internship program go-round. First, they would reconsider the name \"intern,\" which gives the perception that the person may not be a permanent employee. The IPC team also recommended including a contract for the intern to work as an independent IP at the hospital system for a designated time after the internship. \"You would never want to be in a position where you became the training ground for IPs... and then they leave,\" Gray said. \"That would defeat the goal to enhance the organization's IPC staffing.\" HonorHealth suggested instituting a system of weekly progress reports that the preceptor and intern sit down to discuss and share with the overall team. And when the program ends, they recommend conducting a formal evaluation. This not only tracks each intern but ensures all interns receive the same training. It's important to consider the IP precep - tor workload and willingness to serve as a \"Under the guidance of their preceptor, the interns performed regular IPC duties: learning surveillance for HAIs; learning communicable disease identification and reporting; instituting isolation practices; educating staff, students and volunteers; participating in performance improvement activities such as central line and CAUTI infection prevention teams.\"teacher, as well. \"In our case, we did not have a surplus of existing IPs, so the program lent an additional aspect of work,\" Gray said. HonorHealth's team said the internship program could be implemented at any size organization by using the Novice pathway as a guidance tool and coordinating a plan with the clinical services and needs of the organization. In 2017, when the internship concluded, HonorHealth hired its two interns as independent IPs: Mark Marshall, MHI, and Rebecca Ragar, MPH, MLS(ASCP), CIC.

REGISTER BY APRIL 24 TO SAVE! apic.org/apic19 950828_Editorial.indd 1 2/5/19 2:21 PMwww.apic.org | 43 We are at a time where the landscape of healthcare is changing, putting infection prevention and control (IPC) at the forefront. Healthcare delivery mod - els also are shifting. At the same time, more infection preventionists (IPs) are approaching retirement age. In 2015, APIC's MegaSurvey found that 41 per - cent of IPs are aged 55 and over. If they stick to the typical retirement age, about four in 10 IPs will be retiring over the next decade. Additionally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects 1 million nursing vacancies by 2022. Who will step into these unbelievably large shoes and fill the role of the future IP? Two sessions at the APIC 2018 Annual Conference discussed this quandary. Peg Pettis, RN, MPA, CIC, presented the session titled, \"Passing the Baton: Preparing the Next Generation of IPs.\" In her session, Pettis said, \"You have to start thinking outside the box about where your next infection preventionist is coming from.\" At the same time, Kelly Boston, MPH, CIC, CPHQ, FAPIC, and Angela Vassallo, MPH, MS, CIC, FAPIC, presented \"MPH Student to IP: BY SANDY SMITH AND JULIE BLECHMAN, MPH, CHESwith backgrounds in public health Navigating the Changing Landscape of our Profession.\" They argued that those with a master's degree in public health (MPH) will have the skills necessary to fill in this critical gap. CHANGING NEEDS OF INFECTION PREVENTION Many of those approaching retire - ment age are naturally some of the more seasoned IPs. Infection prevention has historically been a field that mid-career nurses might move into after several years in clinical care. It is a model that will not work for the future. Boston said. \"We need to identify people we can bring into infection prevention as a first career. We're up against a clock when somebody comes into infection prevention with a long career behind them.\" The APIC MegaSurvey found that 82 percent of IPs come to the field from nursing, while only five percent have a public health background. \"Today's IPs aren't just nurses. They're microbiologists, advanced practice practitioners, epidemi - ologists, and pharmacists,\" Pettis said. Both Boston and Vassallo came into IPC through an MPH background. \"It is not the traditional route that most people take, but we both believe that the core competency of most hospitals truly is nursing,\" Boston said. \"We feel that the IP needs to bring a complementary skill - set. We really want to advocate for MPHs as a strong asset to your clinical team.\" That changing dynamic may be lost on hospital administrators, which often have a requirement for a registered nurse for an IP position. When Pettis attempted to hire a someone other than a registered nurse (RN) for an opening in her depart - ment, \"administration was very nervous.\" She asked her local health department for names of other facilities that had hired outside the typical RN background. \"The health department was able to provide us with data that decreased administrators' stress.\" The IPC department in Pettis' facility is stronger with a diversity of back - grounds. \"Our nurses come with strengths. These other staff members with different backgrounds have different strengths.\" The work has changed, too. \"What we're doing is not the same as it was five years ago, and it will not be the same five years from now,\" Boston said. IPC now plays a critical role in reimbursements. In 2013's | FEAT URE | Looking forward to IPsANTIKWAR/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM44 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention value-based payment model, seven infec - tion prevention factors could impact pay - ments. \"In 2019, we've moved from process to outcome,\" Boston said. \"We're no longer able to just try to do the right thing. We must have an impact on the patient.\" ALIGNING MPH SKILLS WITH IPC The career trajectory of nurses into IPs cuts out a critical benefit that comes from a diverse workforce. \"When you look at how IPs spend their time, these are not areas exclusive to the clinical expertise that nurses bring,\" Boston said. \"There are areas where we need the nursing skills and areas where your non-nursing IPs will need to focus. The IP coming without that nursing background will need to understand the front line, how they do their work. It's an interdisciplinary field, a broad field.\" Boston and Vassallo studied the core competencies expected of MPH gradu - ates and overlaid it with requirements expected for a certification in infection prevention and control (CIC). \"The core competency models in MPH are very much aligned,\" Vassallo said. \"We're doing biostats all day long. We're at a really sophisticated level. We are field epi - demiologists. How many environment of care rounds or knowledge about construc - tion and housekeeping have you done? These are core of the MPH graduate.\" Boston and Vassallo also published an article in the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC) titled, \"The master of public health graduate as infection pre - ventionist: Navigating the changing land - scape of infection prevention.\"1 They state that competencies from an MPH program that are relevant to infection prevention include the following: Identify key sources of data for epide - miologic Calculate basic epidemiologic measures; - tion to lay and audiences; Draw appropriate inferences from epi - demiologic data; and Evaluate the strengths and limitations of epidemiologic reports. IDENTIFYING THE GAPS IN IPC Boston and Vassallo's AJIC article states, \"Only 8 of the 37 infection prevention competencies outlined in the APIC compe - tency self-assessment are not addressed by typical MPH programs.\"1 This should not dissuade hospital administrators from hir - ing IPs with MPH backgrounds. Vassallo said that about 75 percent of the CIC com - petency areas overlapped with the MPH graduate programs. No matter the background\u2014MPH, RN, or something else\u2014new IPs will need focused training to fill in gaps. MPHs in particular may need help in identifying the processes to prevent and control infection agents and an understanding of employee/ occupational health. APIC's Roadmap for the Novice Infection Preventionist is a great starting place in filling the knowledge gap, Vassallo said. That roadmap\u2014or any sort of well- defined career path\u2014can help staunch the challenge of IPs who leave the profession early. That only adds to a growing prob - lem of inexperienced IPs. The MegaSurvey showed that about 40 percent of IPs have less than five years' experience. \"Do they really have the skills they need to manage the threats right now?\" she asked. As the field changes, that question could apply to even more experienced IPs. \"You can never stop learning in this field,\" Vassallo said. \"If you're doing the assessing yourselves, it helps to have lovely and transparent conversations with your new IPs. Be transparent about where you need to learn things yourselves.\" ONBOARDING AND RETAINING IPS Once qualified IPs with a background in public health have been identified, it is cru - cial to properly onboard them. Research has shown that employees who were wel - comed into a new job with a structured onboarding program were more likely to stay with the job for three years. \"Starting a new job is a little scary and kind of stress - ful,\" Pettis said. \"You can take a few steps to welcome the new IP and help decrease those stress levels.\" On top of the normal onboarding (e.g., welcome emails, schedule information, ori - entation, dress code, etc.), Pettis' IPC team takes it a step further. \"We always put up a welcome sign. Have bagels or a lunch. It is a long-standing tradition in our IPC department to have a welcome basket. We don't put a lot of money into it. We just stick a few things in there to help ease the transition. Cookies, candy. There's always a Tide stick in it.\" While it doesn't have to cost a lot, the return on investment can be significant. Estimates are that a lost RN will cost a facility between $37 ,000-$58,000\u2014with specialized positions, like an IP, at the higher end. Those costs come in recruiting time for HR and the departmental leader - ship, overtime costs for existing staff, and possibly hiring an agency nurse. Keeping new IPs for the long haul is paramount\u2014 and that means helping them grow in their profession. NEXT STEPS FOR IPS Regardless of proficiency level and educa - tional background, it is important for IPs to stay up to date on the latest infection preven - tion best practices. APIC has the Roadmap for the Novice Infection Preventionist as well as the Proficient Practitioner Bridge to keep IPs on track. Earning your CIC will signal to hospital administrators that you have the IPC knowledge needed to perform at a high level. Sandy Smith is a freelance writer based in Nashville.

EARLY BIRD: $1,000 Member $1,150 Non-Member STANDARD RATE: 1 2/6/19 3:58 PM46 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention Diagnostic stewardship in the era of sensitive molecular laboratory tests BY KIRK HUSLAGE, MSPH, BSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC, AND TARA well that healthcare-associ - ated infections (HAIs) can have seri - ous detrimental effects on patients, and that elevated HAI rates are del - eterious to healthcare organizations. An important focus of many quality improve - ment efforts in healthcare is to reduce HAI rates through strategies to prevent infection, but these initiatives often do not address overtesting or diagnostic error. Diagnostic stewardship programs are increasingly common within hospitals as an adjunct to HAI reduction initiatives. The interventions can range from targeted staff education around indications for test ordering and appropriate collection tech - niques, to processes aimed at reducing inappropriate testing such as order restric - tion and gatekeeper-type functions. This is necessary because recent advances in the technology of rapid microbial diagnostic testing can identify the agent causing an infection more quickly than ever before. These tests can allow a clinician to initi - ate targeted therapy sooner and can help limit the use of broad-spectrum antibiot - ics. However, rapid molecular technology is not able to distinguish if the organism is viable or present in sufficient quantity to cause infection. As clinicians begin to rely more on these test results rather than empirical evidence of infection, the poten - tial exists for inappropriate use of these tests, incorrect diagnoses, and initiation of ANGELLODECO/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM unnecessary treatment. Diagnostic stew - ardship can increase the appropriate use and interpretation of these tests and, if appropriately implemented, it can lead to improved quality of care, reduced costs, and may reduce HAI overreporting by preventing the testing of inappropriate patients.1 Ordering diagnostic laboratory tests is common in healthcare, but interpreting the results is complex and often results in diagnostic error.2 Contributing to the error rate are tests that are ordered for patients with a low pretest likelihood of infection, such as testing for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff ) in a patient without clin - ically significant diarrhea or culturing | FEAT URE |www.apic.org | 47 the urine of a patient without symptoms specific to the urinary tract. In this age of increasingly sensitive molecular tests, a \"positive\" finding when pretest likelihood is low is often a false-positive or a coloni - zation rather than true infection.3 This can have serious negative consequences for both the facility and the patient. Inappropriate testing may damage a facil - ity's reputation (and reduce reimburse - ment) if it is identifying and reporting events such as hospital-onset C. diff or catheter-associated urinary tract infec - tions (CAUTIs) from tests performed on asymptomatic patients. Patients may have a prolonged hospital stay and may suffer psychological damage from being put on isolation precautions for C. diff when a true infection is not present. Patients receiving antibiotics for a CAUTI in the absence of true infection may contrib - ute to antibiotic resistance developing in non-targeted organisms, be susceptible to concomitant C. diff infection, or suffer from other adverse drug effects. Implementing a diagnostic steward - ship program may involve modifying the way that laboratory tests are ordered, per - formed, reported, or interpreted.2 The literature indicates that there is a need for diagnostic stewardship; however, there is a lack of consensus guidelines as to which interventions are the most effec - tive. This may be because of variability in factors such as information technol - ogy, patient population, HAI incidence, clinician ordering habits, and availability of laboratory tests. In addition, there are organizational factors to consider, such as the support of administration for the initiative, or laboratory work processes. Morgan et al., offers strategies for stew - ardship interventions at various steps in the testing process for several different HAIs in Table 1 of their publication TABLE 1. STRATEGIES FOR STEWARDSHIP INTERVENTIONS C. diff Diagnostic Stewardship Interventions Urine Culture Diagnostic Stewardship Interventions Ordering: Only test those with new onset of clinically significant diarrhea (3 loose, watery stools in 24 hours) without the use of laxatives.4 Develop decision support tools within the electronic medical record (EMR) to guide appropriate testing. Consider use of gatekeeper for reviewing new C. diff testing orders for appropriateness. No repeat C. diff testing to document clearance of infection (i.e., test for cure).Ordering: Evaluate current processes for obtaining urine cultures (avoid automatic triggers or screening cultures with no appropriate indications). Evaluate practice patterns (avoid panculturing). Obtain urine cultures when appropriate: o Fever in a kidney transplant recipient o Fever in a pregnant patient o Neutropenic fever o Fever after a urologic procedure/surgery o Fever and known urinary tract obstruction o Unexplained suprapubic or flank pain o Spinal cord injury patient with new/worsening spasticity, autonomic hyperreflexia, malaise, lethargy, or sense of unease 5 o At admission of chronically catheterized patient with a new fever or unexplained mental status changes o Septic shock Conduct periodic audits on urine culture use in ICUs to look for trends. Require selection of indications for ordering in EMR. 6 Do not obtain cultures for smelly, cloudy urine or pyuria in the absence of symptoms. 6 Do not obtain samples and hold for an order. No repeat urine cultures to document clearing bacteriuria (no clinical benefit to patient) . Processing: No repeat testing for 7 days following a negative result or 14 days following a positive result. Lab rejects specimens that are not liquid and do not conform to the shape of the container. Consider multi-step methodology that includes both toxin testing and PCR. 4Processing: Obtain urine specimen aseptically (i.e., well cleansed mid- stream capture, via sterile intermittent catheter, or from disinfected sampling port). Ensure specimen is transported to lab within 1 hour for processing or is chemically preserved/refrigerated if delay in processing is anticipated. Reflex testing should be considered only when used in conjunction with careful clinical evaluation for signs/symptoms of UTI. 748 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention Laxative use and testing for Clostridium difficile in hospitalized adults: An oppor - tunity to improve diagnostic stewardship.

As examples, possible diagnostic stewardship activities for C. diff testing and urine culturing are included in the table on page 47. POTENTIAL HARMS OF DIAGNOSTIC STEWARDSHIP There is the potential for unintended consequences any time that care delivery methods are changed, and diagnostic stewardship activities are no exception. Reducing inappropriate testing can be beneficial for both the patient and the healthcare organization; however, unde - rutilization of these tests can be harmful if serious infections are not recognized and treated. An example of this is with C. diff : Overtesting can identify patients with colonization or resolving infection (and lead to unnecessary treatment and inflated HAI rates), but underutiliza - tion of testing because of order restric - tions may lead to undiagnosed infection (resulting in patient harm from not being treated and increased risk of transmission to others). Madden et al., refer to this balance as a need to identify a \"sweet spot\" of diagnostic test usage which can minimize overdiagnosis and false positives, while capturing true positives and preventing underdiagnosis.8 This spot will likely vary based on HAI type and disease prevalence in each particular organization. There should be close monitoring of patient outcomes from diagnostic stew - ardship interventions to detect evidence of patient harm and allow for adjust - ments in the interventions to mitigate for these unintended errors. General out - come measures, such as length of stay, antimicrobial usage, mortality, and read - mission should be tracked to monitor patient safety. Process measures, such as test utilization, should be closely moni - tored to ensure that the interventions are having the intended effect. In addi - tion to aggregate rate data, prospective surveillance for HAIs before and after implementation of a diagnostic steward - ship program should be performed at the patient level to monitor the impact on patients and identify unintended con - sequences. Monitoring overall rates is important, but it is equally important to review the records at the individual level to determine if test avoidance or other diagnostic stewardship activity may have led to delayed recognition or treatment of an HAI and the resultant impact to the patient. CONCLUSION Overuse of testing may lead to inap - propriate diagnosis and unnecessary initiation of antimicrobial therapy which can be detrimental to both the testing facility and the patient. Improving the accuracy of testing can improve patient outcomes and reduce inappropriate drug therapies, but there is a lack of consensus guidelines from professional organiza - tions as to which methods are most ben - eficial. Diagnostic stewardship activities may be a prudent method to improve patient outcomes but should be done with careful monitoring and evaluation. References 1. Rock C, Pana Z, Leekha S, et al.

The emergence of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)\u2014because of its nature\u2014grabbed headlines and sowed panic. AFM is defined as inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal cord leading to limb weakness or paralysis. Clinically, AFM translates to an illness which produces acute flaccid limb weakness.1 AFM is a clinical syndrome with varied causes. By far, the most well-known historical cause of AFM was polio. This virus swept the nation in predictable outbreaks that struck fear in the hearts and minds of American parents until it was tamed by the development of a vaccine and very successful vaccination campaigns. Today, wild polio virus only finds refuge in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where vaccination efforts are regularly derailed by the Taliban.2 AFM appeared in force again in 2016 and now, in 2018, the largest numbers of cases to date has been recorded. As AFM has apparently become a regular feature of the U.S. infectious disease milieu, it is crucial that anyone involved in infection prevention and control (IPC) have a firm and up-to-date understanding of this clinical entity.AFM: Now an established part of the infectious disease milieu BY AMESH ADALJA, MD, FACP, FACEP, FIDSA LIGHTSPRING/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM| FEAT URE |50 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention FIRST CASES As polio, thankfully, receded from the U.S., so did AFM cases. It is important, however, to understand that the polio - virus is part of a group of viruses known as enteroviruses (EVs). All EVs have certain attributes in common and can cause similar syndromes. While non-polio EVs do not appear to have the same penchant for paralysis as polio (even polio only resulted in paralysis in just 1 in 200 cases), they have been known to be capable of causing this rare complication for decades. 3 In 2014, the appearance of AFM was coincident with waves of respi - ratory illness caused by EV-D68, which was not common in the U.S. This temporal relationship led to the hypothesis that EV-D68 had a role in the development of AFM. Indeed, EV-D68\u2014first dis - covered in California in 1962\u2014had been linked in the past to polio-like neurologic disease.4 In all, 120 cases of AFM were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during 2014. No definitive cause was identified, though EV-D68 became highly associated with AFM in the minds of physicians, sci - entists, and epidemiologists. POSSIBLE CAUSES: AUTOIMMUNE VERSUS VIRAL Part of the enigma of AFM is the fact that no single definitive cause has been sufficiently proved to be behind these cases, which have now occurred in three large waves.1 This fact has proven to be frustrating to parents and policy - makers, who often require quick simple answers to medico- scientific problems. The difficulty with attributing a single cause to AFM is that the antecedent infection may be fleeting and not amenable to current diagnostic methods. For example, an inciting virus may only transiently appear in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and by the time lumbar puncture is performed, it may be undetect - able. Similar explanations may lie behind the relative paucity of viral detection in respiratory and stool samples. Alternatively, another hypothesis is that an autoimmune response triggered by viral infection might be behind AFM. 5 In fact, the CDC has detected a viral pathogen in just 4 of 484 CSF specimens. The viruses detected were coxsackievirus A16, EV-A71, and EV-D68. Other known causes include the mosquito-borne West Nile virus and adenovirus. Research since 2014 reveals that newer EV-D68 strains have a newly acquired neurotropism\u2014the predilection for infecting the nervous system\u2014not seen in earlier isolates, adding more evidence that this virus is not just a spurious association.6 Most cases of AFM, despite the lack of a specific viral etiology being uncovered, have an antecedent respiratory infection in the weeks prior to the development of AFM.THE TWO-YEAR CYCLE Arguably the most intriguing aspect of the modern AFM cases is the two-year cycle that is apparent in the U.S. The cases occur between August and October\u2014a time of the year that is temporally associated with respiratory virus circulation. The years 2014, 2016, and 2018 have yielded 120, 148, and 165 (to date) cases, respectively. In 2015 and 2017, just 22 and 35 cases were reported, respectively. The 2014 season was characterized with a spike in EV-D68 respiratory infections, while this was not evident in 2016. In 2018, some clusters of enteroviral (e.g., EV-A71) infections were reported, and there were clusters of hand-foot- and-mouth disease, which is caused by related viruses, as well, but not on the scale of 2014.7,8 The two-year cycle, coupled with the young average age of cases (four years), may reflect deficits of immunity in the population leading to a thresh - old-level as children are born that lack immunity to the specific viral agent that may be responsible. Current diagnostic practice of respiratory infections may have some role in the lack of notice of major EV-D68 (or related virus) clusters. Many cases of upper respiratory infections are not specifically diagnosed, despite the availability of various molecular respiratory viral panels that can accomplish this. Diagnostic testing may be foregone because it is falsely thought to not impact clinical management (in fact, antibiotic stewardship is empowered by viral testing) or cost. Situational awareness of the burden of enteroviral infections is always an underestimate. CLINICAL FEATURES AFM is initially diagnosed clinically and is to be suspected in anyone with a sudden onset of limb weakness or paralysis. Respiratory symptoms may have long since dissipated by this time so need not be present. Ensuring that a patient can move all four limbs against gravity is advised. Patients will often present with weakness in one or more limbs. Some patients may have respiratory or swallowing muscle involve - ment. Myalgias, headache, and sensory symptoms are variably present. The differential diagnosis includes transverse myelitis, demyelinating syndromes, spinal cord stroke, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and other neurologic conditions.9 DIAGNOSTIC TESTING Diagnostic testing for AFM is multimodal. To confirm AFM, not only does a patient need to have acute weakness, but MRI evidence of gray matter inflammation that spans more than one vertebral level, as well as a lumbar puncture revealing inflamma - tory changes in the CSF (WBC > 5).1 Advanced testing for viral and other pathogens is often performed at reference laboratories to establish an etiology. It is important to remember that current www.apic.org | 51 case definitions are designed with epidemiological goals in mind and is, therefore, more inclusive. More restrictive definitions are being developed by researchers. PROGNOSTIC FACTORS With only four years of data, prognosis of AFM is not defini - tively established. Most case patients have residual weakness but demonstrate some improvement. Aggressive physical therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Nerve transfer surgery has also been used to restore movement to paralyzed muscles. 9 INFECTION CONTROL Because of the link with antecedent respiratory illness, a patient with AFM may (or may not) have evidence of ongoing respiratory infection such as cough or sneezing. Most physicians will likely obtain respiratory specimens for viral testing, and, in many hospitals, an order for a respiratory viral panel will trigger droplet transmission-based precautions, which would involve placing a patient in a single occupancy room and requiring visitors to don a mask upon entry. A positive result on the panel would necessitate continuation of precautions for the duration of hospitalization. However, those working in IPC may be faced with panic emanating from hospital administrators and the public that may result in questions regarding augmentation of infection control procedures that is not evidence-based. The third wave of AFM has definitively established this entity as an important infectious disease threat. Coming years will likely see the unraveling of its mysteries and development of better diagnostics and treatment protocols. Because of its clinical presentation and its apparent targeting of children, it is to be expected that AFM will always be a condition that has important significance to the general public. As such, it is important for those involved with IPC to keep abreast with this clinical entity.

In the context of healthcare costs that continue to represent an increasing share of gross domestic product, an aging population, pressing concerns about quality and safety, and payment reform, participants considered how the changing role of infection preventionists (IPs) can help to surmount these challenges. The conference was both an end and a beginning: the culmination of a year of planning and the forerun - ner to a strategic planning exercise designed to guide APIC and the profession until 2025. APIC's current strategic plan has guided the organization for the past eight years and extends to the end of 2019. Organizational leadership wanted to build on its successes as they formulate their next one, according to Katrina Crist, MBA, CAE, APIC's chief executive officer. \"While our current plan has helped us to move the needle in a larger way, we want to continue that thinking and focus on advancing its components more quickly,\" she said. In December 2017, the APIC Board of Directors approved the budget for a consensus conference that could imagine the future of the profession more broadly and inform the organiza - tion's next strategic plan. Linda Greene, RN, MPS, CIC, FAPIC, was president of APIC's board in 2017. \"We had a desire to map out the future and knew that we wanted it to be more than just ourselves. We needed a 30,000-foot view,\" she said.Crafting a shared vision of the future of the infection preventionist A steering committee was formed: Mary Lou Manning, PhD, CRNP, CIC, FAAN, FAPIC Denise Murphy, RN, BSN, MPH, Elizabeth Wallace, MPH, CIC, FAPIC Marc-Oliver Wright, MT(ASCP), MS, CIC, FAPIC The group retained Silver Pennies Consulting to help formulate the structure of the conference. Although Silver Pennies Principal Jann Skelton had extensive prior experience in planning consensus con - ferences, she found APIC's vision \"fantastic and unique.\" \"The APIC board and conference steering com - mittee wanted to create an opportunity for confer - ees to set the future direction and provide input on the future role of IPs, with no preconceived Consensus conference brings diverse stakeholders together BY JENNIFER J.

The 43 attendees included representatives from medical centers, government agencies, ambulatory care, long-term care facili - ties, dialysis centers, home care, and professional societies. Each was assigned to one of four work - groups. They were provided with information and materials in advance, including a curated collection of articles. \"We tried to put everyone on the same page,\" Crist said. Although current APIC board members attended the consensus conference, they did so only as observers. This was a unique twist, said Skelton. \"Not including board members as participants was a very brave decision and a demonstration of real leadership,\" she said. \"The payment structure in healthcare is likely to change radically,\" said Janet Haas, PhD, RN, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC, 2018 APIC board president. \"We realized that we may not have our fingers on the pulse of that change as well as others on the business side. \"We also knew we needed to get out of the 'echo chamber,'\" she continued. \"Even so, it was a little hard to sit on our hands.\" LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE Express Scripts Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller, MD, MBA, delivered the conference keynote address, kicking off the notions,\" she says. \"They truly embraced the pro - cess. It can be difficult for organizations not to be prescriptive. The board, the committee, and the staff were willing to let things evolve.\" Planning began in earnest in March 2018. It was informed in part by a spring research proj - ect conducted by APIC, that strove to understand how C-level hospital executives view IPC, and their expectations for the future. The survey revealed: Patient safety and quality is a top concern for hospital executives. The influence of the IP appears to be increasing in many hospitals. Nearly all respondents (97 percent) expect their facility's IP(s) to track and monitor activities to identify hospital-associated infections (HAIs). Working with Skelton, Crist, and Carlos Fulcher, MBA, CAE, APIC's executive vice president, the steering committee devised four major themes for discussion by participants:1. Reimagining the IP Role: The Future of IPC in a Transformed Healthcare System 2. Preparing IPs for Enhanced Leadership Roles Across the Continuum of Care 3. Developing Strategies that Support the IP's Practice Across the Continuum of Care 4. Building the Business Case for an Enhanced IP Role Quickly, the idea of involving multiple stakeholders, including those outside APIC membership and even outside the profes - sion, became a priority. \"We felt that the participation of invested stakeholders would bring diversity of thought and perspective, lend credibility, and increase the likelihood of success,\" Crist said. The steering committee, which met every two weeks, began brainstorming: Whom to invite? The steering committee, which met every two weeks, began brainstorming: Whom to invite? Guided by the four overarching themes, committee members mapped out representation, seeking balance between and within workgroups. www.apic.org | 55 discussions with a review of the contributions of IPs to healthcare over the past century. Noting that infection control is essential in every healthcare service and specialty, he also emphasized that it is critical both to patient safety and to reining in costs. HAIs result in direct medical costs of at least $28.4 billion each year, as well as 72,000 patient deaths. Conditions are favorable for underscoring the importance of IPC, as value-based reimburse - ment drives cost-reduction initiatives in hospitals and infection becomes even less acceptable. \"Avoiding HAIs is critical to improving health - care,\" Miller said. He also addressed the topic of antibiotic resis - tance and urged attendees to assume responsibility for antibiotic overuse. Resistance has caused at least 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths, according to CDC estimates. The future of IPC, he said, rests on creating a business case tied to national competition and capitated bundles. That change requires leadership, and developing the necessary skills to drive change: Mission focus Trust and belief in people Training and measurement systems Communication and empathy Fewer meetings, more work Next, each of the four steering committee mem - bers partnered with two workgroup colleagues to provide an overview of each of the four main top - ics, charging their fellow participants to answer its \"Golden Question.\" For example, for Workgroup #1, Reimagining the IP Role: The Future of IPC in a Transformed Healthcare System, the question was, \"How could the IP's role be reimagined to provide more broad-based, value-driven contribu - tions to the healthcare system?\" In her introduction, Manning noted that there are some things IPs take for granted: how the healthcare professional workforce is educated, settings in which IPs care for patients, and times when IPs care for patients. All of these paradigms are shifting, noted Mike Bell, MD, deputy director, CDC Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. There is a shift toward extreme high acuity in hospitals, he said. \"IPs can be co-located with those patients and lend valuable expertise. IPs should be patient advocates and protectors and can serve as the principal allies of frontline nurses.\" For Workgroup #2, Preparing IPs for Enhanced Leadership Roles Across the Continuum of Care, the question was, \"How can we identify and develop leaders and keep them in the field at all levels of practice?\" \"It's important to recognize the profession's strengths and successes as we look into the future. We have an opportunity to lead as a country and to help other countries improve in this time of globalization,\" said Lisa Maragakis, MD, MPH, FSHEA, FIDSA, associate professor of medicine at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. Workgroup #3 was focused on Developing Strategies that Support the IP's Practice Across the Continuum of Care. Its question: \"How can IPs leverage data, emerging technologies, and their unique knowledge and skills to improve effective - ness and patient safety as the healthcare environ - ment expands beyond traditional settings?\" Carolyn Kiefer, BSN, RN, CIC, an IP at Carilion Medical Center in Roanoke, Virginia, noted that opportuni - ties for ambulatory infection prevention extend even to such nontraditional settings as health clinics in truck stops. Key skills will include disinfection/ster - ilization, injection safety, surveillance, antimicrobial stewardship, and case management. The future of IPC, Miller said, rests on creating a business case tied to national competition and capitated bundles. That change requires leadership, and developing the necessary skills to drive change. Express Scripts Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller, MD, MBA56 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention The fourth workgroup considered Building the Business Case for an Enhanced IP Role as it sought to answer the question, \"How can IPC programs position themselves to leverage their value and create opportunities for revenue generation?\" Data is key here, noted Timothy Wiemken, PhD, MPH, CIC, FAPIC, asso - ciate professor in the Center for Outcomes Research at St. Louis University. \"Data is important to making our jobs more efficient, but data alone is meaningless. We need robust analytics to generate actionable intel - ligence.\" Gathering data can be expensive, he allowed, but he observed that IPs can use the data they already have to facilitate decision making and educate physician leadership. STRATEGY SESSIONS AND STICKY NOTES Over the next 48 hours, the workgroups would strive to answer key questions in a series of three strategy sessions, rolling up to recommendations that would help to answer the Golden Question for each. Skelton and her colleagues facilitated the strategy sessions, using creativity and innovation tools designed by Bob King of Goal QPC. These included brainwriting, affinity diagrams, and an interrelationship diagraph. Sarah Smathers, MPH, CIC, FAPIC, par - ticipated as a member of Workgroup #1, which focused on reimagining the role of the IP. \"It was really smart to invite nonmembers,\" she said. \"It was a chance to generate new ideas, and they were pushing us to think differently.\" In the brainwriting exercise, each participant silently filled one sticky note after another with ideas. All of these ideas\u2014literally hundreds in total\u2014were recorded and categorized. One of the challenges of the imagining process, Smathers noted, was to focus on generating recommenda - tions without getting bogged down in the specifics of how they would be realized and implemented. \"We had to get out of our own way to envision the ideal,\" she said. Hilary Babcock, MD, MPH, FIDSA, FSHEA, who was a member of Workgroup #3, observed, \"Managing a lot of professional people with a lot of opinions is challenging, but the facilitators did a great job of making sure we made good use of our time and ensured sufficient discussion,\" she says. Babcock is an associate professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine, and president-elect of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. Attending the conference was relevant for her work back home, she says. \"A lot of APIC's topics are issues for us here as well, especially the challenges of expanding infection control to out - patient settings. The discussions really resonated with me.\" Smathers agreed. \"So often, we are just reacting to stimuli in our organization. Attending the conference gave me some new ideas to implement at CHOP [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia]\u2014for example, patient consults. That would be really fulfilling.\" COMING TO CONSENSUS On the third and final day, representatives from each workgroup presented conference conclusions and proposed recommendations for consideration by the entire attendance. All participants had the opportunity to ask questions and make comments. A total of 30 recommendations were presented and discussed; 28 were accepted by the group through a democratic voting process. The adopted recom - mendations will be published in the April issue of the American Journal of Infection Control . \"I'm not sure everyone appreciated the signifi - cance of this,\" said Skelton. \"That was a massive number of recommendations, and they are thought - ful, forward-reaching, and will push the profession. It was pretty extraordinary.\" \"It makes you pause to see what was produced in only two and a half days. You could see and feel \"It makes you pause to see what was produced in only two and a half days. You could see and feel the pride in the room at the end, and that people felt their time was put to good use,\" Crist said. Silver Pennies Principal Jann Skelton.www.apic.org | 57 APIC commissioned a graphic recorder to illustrate the consensus conference. These illustrations replicate the evolution of the discussion and major points that were made. Each workgroup presented specific, concrete recommendations designed to meet the aspirational goals. All participants had the opportunity to discuss these recommendations and vote on them . After two days of workgroup discussions, participants reconvened to report out on the key considerations and goals for their topics. These aspirational statements were arrived at through a series of creativity exercises designed to help drive consensus.In his keynote address, Steve Miller, MD, MBA, chief medical officer at Express Scripts, described the current healthcare landscape and opportunities for IPs to lead into the future.The 28 adopted recommendations from the consensus conference will be published in the April 2019 issue of AJIC.58 | SPRING 2019 | Prevention \"APIC is here to help advance the profession, with patient safety at the center of everything we do,\" Crist said. \"We included multiple perspectives and insights to ensure that we are rel - evant and that the process was credible. Stakeholders can believe in the recom - mendations and that we will do some - thing with them.\" An added, although not unexpected, positive outcome of the conference was the relationships that were formed. \"Several people came up to me and asked, 'How was I invited and who do I thank?'\" Manning said. In a healthcare environment that increasingly emphasizes teamwork, these relationships will be beneficial. \"I hope we will continue to collaborate to improve care for patients and people,\" says Haas. \"We worked to bring APIC into the future with maximum clarity, and to ensure that we are ready for the changes that will surely come.\" Jennifer J.
