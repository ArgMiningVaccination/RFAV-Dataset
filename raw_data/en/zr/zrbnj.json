Fortunately, many of both are in development, though we don't yet know what works. The first vaccines are likely to become available towards the end of 2020 for front-line workers and for masses in 1H21. Drugs to treat infections may already be available if existing ones we have for other diseases turn out to work for COVID-19 (e.g. remdesivir, Actemra), but if we do need new ones (as we likely will), then those probably won't be available until September 2020 or later (need to run tests and manufacture). COVID-19 DISEASE OVERVIEW SYMPTOMS: Fever, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath are the major symptoms associated with COVID-19. The CDC also includes loss of taste or smell, chills, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat as symptoms to watch for. While other symptoms have been reported, they occur much less frequently. DISEASE PROGRESSION: PRE-INFECTION COVID-19 can be prevented through the use of basic precautions and (in the future) an effective vaccine. POST-EXPOSURE After exposure to SARS-CoV-2, it takes several days for symptoms to develop. During this incubation period, the infected person is able to transmit the virus despite being unaware of their illness. This is why basic protective measures like social distancing, hand washing, and mask wearing are critical. Most people develop symptoms between 2-14 days post-infection, with the majority developing symptoms by 5 days5. If we had a therapy that was safe, efficacious, and easy to administer, it could be given to people who have come into contact with infected individuals (such as caretakers or hospital workers) to try to prevent them from becoming infected. This kind of treatment is called post-exposure prophylaxis, and while there are currently many ongoing trials in this space, no medications are yet approved for this purpose. Those who believe they have been exposed to the virus should self- quarantine for 14 days to prevent spreading it to others. MILD Most patients who develop COVID-19 have a mild disease course and are able to manage their symptoms at home using over-the-counter medications that relieve pain and/or reduce fever (e.g., Tylenol/acetaminophen or Advil/ibuprofen). If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please follow the advice of your healthcare professional. Some \"asymptomatic\" patients with COVID-19 may not develop any noticeable symptoms and may not realize they have been infected. Because these individuals can still spread the virus, everyone should employ basic protective measures like social distancing, hand washing, and mask wearing (obviously none of those are necessary if you live by yourself and never see anyone else, though washing hands is still nice). HOSPITALIZATION Some patients who develop COVID-19 symptoms become seriously ill (1 out of every 6 diagnosed, but a lower rate amongst all, including undiagnosed, who are infected), develop difficulty breathing, and must be admitted to the hospital to manage these symptoms. Older people (65 years old) and those with other medical issues are most at risk of developing serious illness. Some identified risk factors include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), chronic lung disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Typically, hospitalized patients have difficulty breathing and decreased levels of oxygen in their blood, requiring administration of supplemental oxygen6,7. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious complication in patients with severe disease and is associated with a high risk of respiratory failure. These patients must be carefully managed in the intensive care unit, often with the use of mechanical ventilation, and have the highest risk of death from COVID-19. ARDS is common for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (20-42%) and initial labored breathing can quickly progress to ARDS and ICU admission. In addition to lung injury, ARDS is also associated with kidney, liver, and heart complications, which can also increase the risk of mortality8,9,10. 1 \"Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus ....\" 28 Feb. 2020, https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf 2 \"International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology - Wiley Online Library.\" 12 Apr. 2020, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alr.22579 . 3 \"Alterations in Smell or Taste in Mildly Symptomatic Outpatients ....\" 22 Apr. 2020, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765183 . 4 \"Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as a clinical ....\" 6 Apr. 2020, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00405-020-05965-1 . 5 \"The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\" 10 Mar. 2020, https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported .

Accessed 20 Apr. 2020. SARS-COV-2 REPLICATION AND TRANSMISSION The virus that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. SARS stands for \"severe acute respiratory syndrome,\" which can involve shortness of breath, pneumonia and/or respiratory distress, and the virus is so named because it closely resembles the virus (SARS-CoV) that caused the SARS outbreak of 2002/2003. Both viruses come from the coronavirus (CoV) family. SARS-CoV-2 is enclosed by a protective lipid (fatty) membrane containing proteins that give the virus structure and allow for infection.The membrane is a weak point that makes it easy to kill with soap, bleach, or alcohol. Inside the virus there is a single strand of ribonucleic acid, or RNA, that contains the virus's genetic information. The coat of the virus consists of several structural proteins, including the spike protein (S), which allows the virus to attach to host cells and gives the virus its distinctive shape. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by binding a specific protein, called \"ACE2,\" on the cell surface; once inside, the virus hijacks the host's cellular machinery to replicate and assemble more viral particles. After the virus binds the cell, enzymes produced by the host (TMPRSS2) activate the viral spike protein (S), which allows the virus to enter the cell (see schematic below)1,2. Once inside the cell, the virus rapidly makes more copies of its genetic material (RNA) as well as the proteins needed to create new viral particles. The RNA is packed into new particles, which are released into the body to infect surrounding cells. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to first infect the cells of the nose and throat, from where it can spread, but it does not cause significant symptoms until it progresses into the lung. During the first stage of infection patients are more likely to spread the virus to others by coughing or breathing, even before they start to show symptoms (referred to as \"asymptomatic\") or while their symptoms are too mild to distinguish from a harmless cold. Once the virus makes it way into the lungs, more notable symptoms (coughing, fever, and/or shortness of breath) start to become more prevalent. SARS-CoV-2 also uses additional mechanisms to slow down the response of the immune system, meaning that the infection can linger for longer and the host can infect more people. In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV primarily and quickly infect lung cells, which are deeper in the respiratory tract and cause an earlier onset of serious symptoms, so patients can be identified and quarantined sooner before they spread the virus, making it easier to stamp out the original SARS and MERS cases before they triggered a pandemic. TRANSMISSION: SARS-CoV-2 is spread from person to person mainly through respiratory droplets that are created when a person coughs, sneezes, or talks (similar to how influenza spreads). These droplets are thought to travel no more than six feet, thus this distance is reflected in current social distancing rules, though research shows microdroplets can travel further and therefore 6 feet should be considered a minimum. 10 feet apart is better. Wearing masks in public places can help prevent both the spread of these droplets to others if you are infected and at least partially reduce inhalation of these droplets from others if you are well. SARS-CoV-2 may also spread by touching an infected surface followed by subsequent contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. Regular hand washing and disinfection of commonly touched surfaces can help reduce this type of spread. There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can spread through food (different from foodborne viruses like norovirus or hepatitis A) or through mosquitoes (different from mosquito-borne viruses like Zika or West Nile). SARS-CoV-2 causes respiratory symptoms that increase its spread to others, unlike foodborne viruses that cause gastrointestinal symptoms and spread primarily through contact or sharing food or utensils. Furthermore, in contrast to mosquito- borne viruses, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 occurs directly from person to person and not through an animal host. SARS-CoV-2 could theoretically be transmitted by blood transfusions, but viral transmission has not been linked to blood transfusion for SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS. Viral genomic material has been detected in the blood of ~15% of patients hospitalized with COVID-193, but not in patients with milder disease4. For COVID-19, we do not yet know whether these patients have infectious viral particles in their blood or only (noninfectious) genomic material. Both SARS and MERS, two other related respiratory diseases caused by novel coronaviruses, were also associated with detectable virus particles in the blood during infections, particularly SARS (~75% of patients with SARS5 and ~33% of patients with MERS6). Additionally, replicating coronavirus particles have been detected in the blood of mice infected with SARS7. We also know that non-human primates can be infected with the virus that causes SARS (SARS-CoV) via blood transfusions and that these animals also develop SARS symptoms8. While it is encouraging that none of these diseases have been linked to human blood transfusions, there are reasons to remain vigilant: SARS and MERS had very different infection numbers (~8,000 SARS infections9 and ~2,500 MERS infections10 worldwide) and almost no asymptomatic infections (greatly reducing the risk of infected patients donating blood). 1 Understanding SARS-CoV-2 and the drugs that might lessen ....\" 12 Mar. 2020, https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/03/12/understanding-sars-cov-2-and-the-drugs-that-might-lessen-its-power .

Other drugs might protect organs from damage while the immune system fights the infection. Finally, some other drugs stimulate the immune response to help it beat the virus or dampen the immune response to prevent it from overreacting to the infection and causing the patient more harm than good. In addition to treating a known infection, drugs can be used prophylactically (before confirmation of infection) and could make sense for people at high risk of infection (e.g., healthcare workers) to prevent infection; they can also be used to treat someone with a known SARS-CoV-2 infection even before they show signs of disease to try to keep the symptoms as mild as possible. Viable prophylactic therapies must be safe, well-tolerated, and convenient to administer; if drugs are dangerous, hard to tolerate, difficult to administer (e.g., IV), or difficult to manufacture at scale, then they may be reserved for sicker patients and used in the hospital (e.g., once someone is admitted and put on oxygen). If drugs can both increase survival and facilitate quicker discharge from the hospital then such drugs might mitigate our fears of infection sufficiently to lift social distancing requirements, since we would then know that hospitals can quickly help the people who need help to recover safely. However, only remdesivir has shown clear activity to date and received Emergency Use Authorization (not same as full FDA approval, but for now may as well be the same), but it is hardly a cure (~30% reduction in time to discharge and likely a reduction in chance of death) and the fact that it requires IV administration and has potentially serious liver toxicity will limit its use to the hospital setting. Other drugs that seemed promising early on have since disappointed when we got more clinical data. In terms of drugs that could help treat COVID-19 quickly and easily to allow society to open up again, the most promising classes of drugs for which we will have clinical data in 2020 are monoclonal antibodies (temporarily mimic what vaccines do) and oral polymerase inhibitors, (hopefully do what remdesivir does but better and more conveniently). Keep Severely Ill Patients Alive While Other Strategies (Natural Immunity and/or Antiviral Therapy) Clear Infection Goal is to extend life in the hopes that the patient's immune system and/or antiviral therapies can beat the infection. Patients with advanced stages of COVID-19 will often develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or broad organ failure.UPDATED: SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 Visit www.racap.com/covid-19 for latest version.

Blocking IL-1 signaling may help reduce inflammation and associated lung injury. Target IL-8 signaling IL-8 released by intra-alveolar macrophages enhances the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes into the lung during ARDS. Blocking IL-8 signaling may help reduce the hyperinflammation in the lung. Target IL-33 signaling IL-33 is involved in regulating lung immune response in asthma.

Dexamethasone was shown to reduce mortality by 35% in ventilated patients and 20% in those requiring oxygen, leading to its approval in the UK and likely other countries in the near future. The success of dexamethasone raises the likelihood that other corticosteroids will also prove beneficial. Anti-CCR5 immunosuppressive Prevent onset or reduce impact of cytokine storm Acute viral disease can trigger an overreaction of the immune system, commonly referred to as a \"cytokine storm,\" which can be fatal. Drugs aiming to prevent the onset of a cytokine storm or reduce its impact generally suppress parts of the immune system to limit its overactivation while still leaving a sufficient immune response against SARS- CoV-2 to clear the infection.Inhaled IV Inhibit C5/C5a/C5aR Target other aspects of inflammation This is a catch-all category for a wide range of drugs, some of which broadly inhibit inflammation (and therefore might have more side-effects) and others which work on a specific branch of the immune system. It is hard to say which is more likely to work, hence the need for many studies. As trials read out, we can fill in this section to see if patterns emerge that might help us understand the nature of the immune overreaction to SARS-CoV-2.Target IL-6 signaling IL6 is a known mediator of cytokine storm, though early data in COVID-19 suggests this strategy will not work well. Antibodies tar geting IL-6 or IL-6R prevent soluble IL6 from binding the IL6 receptor, reducing signaling and risk of cytokine storm. The anti-IL-6R mAb Actemra is often used to manage some autoimmune diseases as well as overactive cytokines associated with some cancer therapies. Inhibit specific cytokines By inactivating specific pathways involved in recruiting the immune system to the lungs, these drugs are more likely to disarm harmful immune responses while keeping beneficial virus-specific responses intact. The trouble is that we are not yet sure which cytokines are most important in COVID-19, so we will learn from trials.

HydroxychloroquinePrevent virus from attaching to cells while also targeting infected cells for immune destruction using antibody therapies Antibodies can both bind to the virus to prevent it from attaching to cells and also direct the immune system to destroy infected cells (which have viral proteins on their surface). Monoclonal antibodies can be engineered to only block the virus from infecting cells without targeting infected cells for destruction, but it is not clear whether any company has chosen to disable this \"effector\" function. If they have, that would potentially make the monoclonal antibody less effective. As more information becomes available on the design of various antibody therapies we can classify them according to whether they only block viral entry or whether they both block entry and have immune effector functions. Even among antibodies that have immune effector functions, there are those that have ordinary levels of effector functions and those that have been engineered with increased effector function (e.g., Vir made both versions of its lead antibody). Polyclonal antibodies (poly means 'many,' as opposed to mono, meaning 'one') are mixtures of antibodies derived from a person or immunized animals. One strategy is using convalescent serum, which means taking the (polyclonal) antibodies from a patient who has recovered from COVID-19 (i.e., has convalesced) and using them to help other patients clear their infection. These antibodies are not typically modified from their natural form, though it is technically possible to engineer them further to increase potency. Currently no companies we are aware of are modifying polyclonal antibodies for treating COVID-19. Another strategy is to immunize animals, (e.g., horses or cows), to use their antibodies; however, that will first require developing a vaccine of some kind that can be given to animals. Monoclonal antibodies against Spike protein that could both neutralize the virus and direct the immune system to destroy infected cells: likely to work (since they mimic how the immune system fights the virus) but will take time to produce at very large scale (for millions and tens of millions of patients) There is good reason to believe that this drug class could work and might be clinically validated, FDA approved, and ready for at least low- scale use by end of 2020, maybe even late Fall 2020. Antibodies will be tested for treating infections and as prophylaxis to prevent infection in those at risk. If used to prevent infection, they would likely be limited to front-line workers due to limited supply; alternatively, they could be prioritized for vulnerable members of households, or nursing homes, where increased infection risk is suspected (e.g., vulnerable individuals who live with essential workers). For prophylaxis, IV delivery of the antibody would be too inconvenient for large numbers of people. Therefore, if we aim to provide prophylaxis to a larger proportion of the community, the ideal prophylactic antibody solution would need to be injected (up to 2 mL can fit in a subcutaneous injection, up to 3 mL can fit into an intramuscular one; antibodies can be formulated to a concentration of 100-150 mg/mL, so in the worst case a person could get more than one injection at a time). Some companies have evaluated antibodies produced by the immune systems of recovered patients to identify specific antibodies that appear most effective at (1) neutralizing the virus by binding to viral Spike protein and thus blocking viral entry into the cell and (2) directing the immune system to destroy infected cells. These antibodies need to be produced at large scale but manufacturing will not meet global demand if these agents are effective. Estimating that each patient is likely to need around 0.3-1.5 grams, treating millions of people would require producing literally tons of antibody material, meaning that even if these agents work we will still need to flatten the curve (through social distancing and other basic protective measures) to make the most of what we can produce. While it is possible that giving a dose to an uninfected person could protect them from infection for many months (~6 months is plausible), they are no substitute for a vaccine. One metric ton would make 1M doses of 1 gram each, and the most widely used antibody products are manufactured on the scale of tens of metric tons per year, not hundreds. Polyclonal antibodies: less scalable if derived from people than from animals It is not yet clear whether antibodies taken from people who recovered from mild infections will be strong enough to help people recover from serious infections. Prevent virus from binding host receptor Binding to host receptors like ACE2 is necessary for viral entry Inhibit host protease Proteolytic cleavage of Spike protein is necessary for viral entry Drugs developed to prevent influenza entry The process by which influenza enters cells is different from the SARS-CoV-2 entry process, making it unclear whether these drugs can stop SARS-CoV-2 from infecting cells.Target the host to prevent viral entryTarget the virus to block viral entry Hyperimmune globulin: purified antibodies that are derived from pooled convalescent plasmaAdvancing an antibody cocktail: more like - ly to withstand emergence of muta - tions Combination of different neutralizing antibodies Single multi-valent molecule that binds different sites on Spike Only current example lacks effector functions, which may reduce efficacy relative to some other antibody therapies Broadly neutralizing antibodies: may be effective against other coronaviruses Requires plasma source to produce Production can be pooled across many donors to make a more consistent productEngineered cattle Pigs Does not require plasma to produce In fact, this is better characterized as a diverse cocktail of monoclonal antibodies. Conceptually very interesting but have not demonstrated production at large scale.Polyclonal antibodies derived from animals: not currently available but have potential for greatly increased scalability Can produce tens of thousands of doses. Polyclonal antibodies purified from plasma of recovered patients: available now in small amounts but cannot be produced at large scale Convalescent serum contains a mixture of different (polyclonal) antibodies that could provide protection for people that have not yet generated their own immune response. The advantage of using convalescent serum is that it is available right now fr om everyone who has recovered from COVID-19. But these antibodies will first require evaluation in clinical studies to demonstrate how effective they are. For example, some labs are reporting that there are few neutralizing antibodies in the serum of patients who recovered from mild infections. If these polyclonal antibodies from recovered patients demonstrate that they save lives, then many people will be asked to donate their blood. It will be important to understand the right therapeutic dose of these antibodies and also what factors impact quality; for example, it is not clear whether it would be better to use antibodies from someone who had a serious case and got to high antibody levels or whether it would be good enough to use antibodies from people who recovered from a mild or asymptomatic infection, who may be easier to find.Engineered animals Animals that produce human antibodies can avoid risk of developing immune response against the therapy. Non-engineered animalsHorses Risk of developing unwanted immune response against the horse antibodies. FAILED P RCT Pharmstandard (Arbidol/umifenovir) ORAL FAILED P RCT Ansun Biopharma (DAS181) INHALED Block viral fusion with host cells Remove sialic acid from host lung cells to prevent viral adhesion The importance of sialic acid for SARS-CoV-2 entry is currently unclearLess likely to work: drugs repurposed to try to block entryCOMPLETE ORALBlock virus entry through secondary cellular receptors: likely less relevant There are reports that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can bind to receptors besides ACE2; however, the relevance of these additional binding mechanisms is currently unclear.AXL CD147 Inhaled formulation of approved drug remdesivir May allow for remdesivir to be used in milder patients DATA:TBD P RCT Airway Therapeutics (AT-100)Non-specifically block viral to anti-spike protein mAb Unclear what advantage this has, but two binding sites could be better than one.Specifically block viral entry into cells using soluble ACE2 decoy protein to bind viral Spike protein (preventing it from binding real ACE2 on cells): likely limited to the hospital setting due to IV administration In theory this should be an effective strategy though the manufacturing of pr oteins can be difficult, which will preclude a large supply of this type of drug in the near term. Standard formulation Gut targeted oral formulation Extended release formulation to increase drug exposure Standard formulation Standard formulationExtended release formulation to increase drug exposure DATA:2Q21 lambda Rationale is to stimulate the immune response in mild patients in whom drug is less likely to exacerbate cytokine storm (though drug is long-acting). Fewer r eceptors for interferon-lambda in the lung than other interferons, so potentially safest of the interferons. Oral TLR7 InjectionInjection Deliver NK cells: limited to hospitals because of supply constraints Infuse NK cells to promote antibody-mediated killing of infected cells. Deliver adenovirus vector Better toleratedGenerate NO in the nasal cavity NO has antiviral properties in laboratory experiments Dysregulate intracellular calcium levels Repurposed acid pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce replication of SARS-CoV-2 . Repurposed antipsychotic repurposed molecule Degrade extracellular RNA Repurposed antibiotic Target the immune response against the virus to help clear the infection Success of these programs in animal models may not predict success in humans, partly due to differences in immune responses across organisms. We must therefore discount the probability of success of many of these programs.Oral: unlikely to get much drug into lungs because of poor systemic absorption Antihelminthic drugs These drugs normally kill tapeworms, which are very unlike viruses, by poorly defined mechanisms, but there has been some in vitro evidence of efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, though not necessarily at doses that can be achieved in humans.More likely to work: drugs specific for blocking SARS-CoV-2 entry Viral entry requires several steps: 1. The viral Spike protein must bind to a receptor called ACE2 on the cell surface in the right way (to its receptor binding domain, or RBD). Drugs that lower ACE2 or block the ACE2/Spike interaction might therefore prevent the virus from attaching to cells. 2. After binding ACE2, an enzyme called TMPRSS2 on a cell's surface must 'clip' the viral Spike protein, activating it. Drugs that inhibit TMPRSS2 might therefore interfere with this process. 3. The virus fuses with the host cell membrane and enters the cell. TGF-2 knock down TGF-2 suppresses the immune system, thus its inhibition may have an immunostimulatory effect.Anti-CD73 antibody Activates B cells and induces antibody production Inhibit suppressive factors Inhibit mTORC upregulate innate antiviral gene expression Nonspecific immune activationIL-15 agonist Deliver IL-7Interleukin (IL) GM-CSF Stimulate immune response Some of these approaches may be risky (inhaled immune stimulants), or tedious and hard to manufacture at scale (infused NK cells), and will therefore require evidence that they will not cause excessive inflammation resulting in lung damage.Broad spectrum aniparasitic agent These compounds are rapidly eliminated from the body and will likely need to be modified to achieve sufficiently high drug levels in the lung.

Other drugs are now being tested in combination with remdesivir.Approved for Emergency Use to Treat Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients Being developed specifically for SARS-CoV-2Previously developed for treating other viruses and unlikely to be a perfect fit for SARS-CoV-2 Most promising: target viral RNA polymerase (which makes copies of the viral genome) using nucleoside/ tide analogs, essentially messing up the viral assembly line by inserting incorrect parts into the mix Block guanosine production IMPDH inhibitor Block pyrimidine production DHODH inhibitorBlock production of the nucleosides: limiting the availability of the building blocks needed for viral replicationMore convenient delivery: Oral or inhaled If shown to be effective, these drugs could be used outside of hospitals or could even be sent to people's homes for self-treatment. Could be available by Fall 2020 and could be scaled up to help millions of patients by early 2021 if effective. The key to efficacy will likely be getting a high enough dose into the lungs. Target viral protease Protease is a viral enzyme that cuts viral raw protein materials into active pieces Block transport of viral proteins from nucleus to cytoplasm using a toxic anticancer drug Nitazoxanide Ivermectin Deliver unconventional therapeutic modality: harder to manufacture at scale Activate receptors that promote vasodilation and anti- inflammatory state Resist overactivation of pro-inflammatory AT1 receptorBlock viral protein translation or processingAdvancing single antibodies binding one site on the Spike protein: increased risk of mutations that reduce antibody binding Several of these individual antibodies could be combined if needed. DATA:TBD P RCT Vir entry by reducing the levels of ACE2 on cells, essentially making the cells untouchable to the virus: limited by potential side effects If ACE2 is needed for important functions in the human body then r educing the levels on the surface of cells may cause side effects; however , these effects would likely be manageable since treatment would be needed only briefly. Indirectly reduce ACE2 levels using estrogen Inhaled: ensure drug gets preferentially into lung Unknown route of deliveryDirectly reduce ACE2 levels using RNAi Historically it has been difficult to deliver RNAi to the lung DATA:4Q20 P and RussiaFavpiravir Antimalarial drugs: limited by cardiac side effects and have yet to show clinical efficacy These established drugs have known cardiac side-effects (can cause sudden cardiac death). Clinical trials have thus far failed to show any efficacy for this class of drugs despite early signals fr om uncontrolled trials that suggested they helped patients recover faster. FAILED Niclosamide Commonly taken as an oral pill but not absorbed well into the bloodstr eam; this works well for killing gut-residing tapeworms but greatly reduces systemic delivery and penetration into lung tissue. Deliver conventional drugs: easier to manufacture at scaleBlock viral replication once the virus is inside the cellOral Unclear mechanism of action: we do not really know how these drugs work; their use for COVID-19 is based on anecdotal evidence of antiviral activity and they have thus far not shown clear efficacy This is a big disadvantage that makes it less likely that they will actually work when we test them in patients (though not impossible; we still do not know how some effective drugs for a variety of diseases work). We already have enough data from trials evaluating chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to say that these drugs either do not work, hardly work, or maybe even cause more harm than good (especially when combined with other ineffective drugs).

Our visualization aims to convey not only individual innovations from specific companies but also the collective effort and sheer hustle of the entire industry. The legacy of COVID-19 will hopefully include not only new treatments for an acute viral illness but also a greater appreciation of what society can accomplish when we unite against a common foe. We've already achieved remarkable innovations in many diseases: hepatitis C, HIV, melanoma, breast cancer, and cystic fibrosis, to name a few. What we need now is a sustained, collective effort to make medical advances available to everyone instead of overburdening patients with excessive out-of-pocket costs that discourage them from receiving appropriate care. This will require fundamentally reforming America's insurance system, building on the recent patches put in place after payers initially refused to cover COVID-19 testing and the uninsured were overwhelmed by the cost of hospitalization. The Biotech Social Contract, as described in The Great American Drug Deal , affirms that we do not have to choose between innovation and affordability. We as a society can rise to the challenge of tackling all human diseases just as we have COVID-19, making investments that will permanently upgrade our health and that of future generations. p e t e r ko lc h i n s k y INCUBATION PERIOD 100% OF THE POPULATION RECOVERY/IMMUNE 5-14 DAYS AFTER INFECTION 40% OF INFECTED PATIENTS MILD SYMPTOMS 5-14 DAYS AFTER INFECTION 80% OF SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED MODERATE/SEVERE SYMPTOMS 7 DAYS AFTER ONSET OF SYMPTOMS 14% OF SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS TWO WEEKS in hospitalRECOVERY CAN RANGE BETWEEN 0-6 WEEKS depending on severity ICU REQUIRED CRITICAL SYMPTOMS 10.5 DAYS AFTER ONSET OF SYMPTOMS 6% OF SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS 40% ASYMPTOM- ATIC PATIENTS 60% SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS THREE WEEKS in hospital/ICU WEEK THREE INFECTION (5-14 DAYS BETWEEN INFECTION & ONSET OF SYMPTOMS) ONSET OF SYMPTOMS WEEK ONE WEEK TWO WEEK FOUR TWO MONTHS TWO MONTHSINFECTIONDISEASE SEVERITY AND PROGRESSION TIMELINE SENSITIVITY OF KEY BIOMARKERS FOR COVID-19 SOURCE: https://diagnostics.roche.com/us/en/products/params/elecsys-anti-sars-cov-2.html RNA peaks at day 3-4 IgM ANTIBODIES peaks between day 7-14 IgG ANTIBODIES peaks after day 14ANTIGEN peaks at day 1-2RECOVERY RESOLVED INFECTION/POTENTIAL IMMUNITY DAY 1 DAY 2 DAY 3 DAY 4 DAY 5 DAY 6 DAY 7 DAY 8 DAY 9 DAY 10 DAY 11 DAY 12 DAY 13 DAY 14 DAY 15 DAY 16 DAY 17 DAY 18 DAY 19 DAY 20 DAY 21 DAY 22 DAY 23 DAY 24 DAY 25 DAY 26 DAY 20 DAY 27 DAY 28 DAY 29 DAY 30 DAY 31ONGOING INFECTION/INFECTIVITYPATHOGEN PRESENCE IMMUNE RESPONSEONSET OF SYMPTOMS RNA ANTIGENIgG ANTIBODIES IgM ANTIBODIES PCR (Ag)IgM (Ab)IgG (Ab)SIGNIFICANCE Patients may be in the \"window period\" of SARS-COV-2 infection Patient may be in the early stage of infection, and the body's immune response first produced the antibody IgM, but no IgG was produced or the IgF content did not reach the detection limit of the diagnostic treatment.

VIP also inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro .Target cathepsin-L, a cysteine protease that may help facilitate viral entry Target the Renin- Angiotensin System (RAS) SARS-CoV-2 enters lung cells via the ACE2 receptor, a membrane- bound enzyme that lowers blood pressure by helping convert angiotensin II (AngII) into angiotensin-(1-7). Angiotensin-(1-7) is a peptide that acts through the MAS receptor to maintain an anti- inflammatory state. When SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell, it takes the ACE2 receptor with it, lowering ACE2 levels and causing AngII build-up. Blocking the pro-inflammatory AngII receptor AT1, or agonizing the anti- inflammatory AT2 or MAS receptors may overcome this imbalance and reduce lung inflammation. Similarly, blocking ACE may lead to increased levels of angiotensin-(1-7), the product of ACE2-cleaved AngII. We understand how these drugs work, making it easier to predict their success or failure in trials and to extrapolate findings to other similar drugs This is a big advantage for predicting clinical trial results; when you do not know how a drug works, doing a clinical trial is more of a shot in the dark.
