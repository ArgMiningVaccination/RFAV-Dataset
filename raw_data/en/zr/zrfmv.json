If you would like copies of this document or additional information please call the Section of Epidemiology HIV/STD Program at (907) 269-8000 or visit the website at http://epi.alaska.gov/ hivstd/hppg.Dear Alaskan: The Alaska HIV Prevention Planning Group is pleased to present the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan. We are providing both our recommendations and the data and information that shaped them to help guide and sustain effective HIV prevention activities throughout the state. Our goal is to prevent new HIV infections in Alaska. Continued progress towards this goal requires contributions from all sectors. The strategies and interventions proposed in this Plan, a number of which will be carried out by local organizations with State grants of federal funds, are a limited part of the overall effort. Ultimately, the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that help individuals prevent infection are promoted and supported by families, friends, churches, health care providers, tribal health organizations, social groups, schools, public policy-setting bodies and communities. The sexual and injection behaviors that place individuals at risk for HIV infection occur not in isolation but within the broader context of our communities. Changing the social factors that contribute to risk behavior , eliminating stigma and discrimination against those infected and af fected by HIV , and supporting lifelong healthy behaviors are all critical to preventing new HIV infections. Persons who are living with HIV can make important contributions to raising awareness about the epidemic. Communities can play an important, positive role in educating their members about preventing transmission of HIV and ensuring that the voices of persons living with HIV are not silenced by fear of discrimination. It is our sincere hope that no more Alaskans will become infected with HIV . We encourage all citizens to take part in local prevention activities, to increase awareness and understanding of HIV/AIDS, and to show compassion for those infected and affected by HIV and AIDS. Act within your own family, work place, social groups, or community organizations to make this become the reality in Alaska.

In 2006, more than 1 million persons are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS in the United States (CDC, 2006a). With the advent of highly activ e antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the mid-1990s, the overall progression of HIV infection to AIDS and from AIDS to death slowed for those in treatment. Persons with HIV infection can potentially live longer , healthier lives with the therapies that are currently available. This underscores the importance of early diagnosis and entry into care, as well as the need for preven tion services for the grow ing population of persons living with HIV. The development of alternatives to serologic te sting for HIV (oral fluid, urine, finger-prick and rapid tests) has facilitated HIV testing in a wide range of clinical and community settings thus making HIV testing more accessible. Widespread availability and use of HIV testing has resulted in approximately 50% of persons aged 15 -44 years in the U.S. reporting that they have had an HIV test. Yet despite the uptake in HI V testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that as many as a quar ter of a million persons in the U.S. currently have HIV but are unaware of th eir infection. Persons with HIV who are unaware of their infection may transmit the virus unknowingly to others and are at considerable risk for developing AIDS. The challenge remains not only to increase the accessibility of testing, but to promote testing for persons who may have been exposed to HIV but who do not perceive their risk, and persons aware of their risk who defer testing for other reasons. The number of new HIV infections in the U.S. is estimated to have remained stable at 40,000 per year since the early 1990s, comp ared to the more than 150,000 cas es per year occurring in the mid-1980s. Nationally, perinatal transmission of HIV has been greatly reduced though routine HIV screening of pregnant wo men during prenatal care and antiretroviral therapy for HIV infected pregnant women and newborns. With interventions to reduce injection drug use and prevent sharing of syringes, ther e has been a substantial decrease in HIV transmission associated with injection drug use. These successes argue for the continuation of these strategies to prevent perinatal and IDU-relate d transmission of HIV. The demographics of the epidemic have shifte d over the past 25 years. The majority of HIV/AIDS cases continue to occur among males. Th is is particularly true for men who have sex with men who account for approximately 45% of all newly reported HIV/AIDS diagnoses in the U.S. As the number and proportion of cases in males have declined, the proportion of cases in females has increased. Women now make up approximately one quarter of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Racial/ethnic minorities are dispropor tionately affected by HIV/AIDS and disparities have widened over time. In 2004, estimated U.S. HIV/AIDS case rates for Blacks and Hispanics were 8.5 and 3.3 times higher, re spectively, than rates for White s. Among females, U.S. case rates among Black females were 21 times higher than rates for White females (CDC, 2006b). These shifts in the distribution of HIV/AIDS cases present new and ongoing challenges: how to effectively reach women and heterosexuals at incr eased risk and how to mobilize racial/ethnic 1 Chapter One: Introductionminority communities to engage with HIV prevention efforts, while continuing to provide effective approaches to risk reducti on among men who have sex with men. Alaska is fortunate in having a relatively low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. Through December 2005, a total of 1,048 cases of HIV or AIDS were re ported in the state. This includes persons who were first diagnosed in Alaska and persons who moved to Alaska with an earlier diagnosis of HIV or AIDS. The number of newly diagnosed cases averaged 40 (ranging from 36 to 58) per year over the five year period of 2001 through 2005. Cases of perinatal transmission and pediatric cases (< 13 years of age) have b een rare in Alaska. Voluntary HIV testing during prenatal care appears to be wide ly accepted and routinely offered. Alaskans are being tested for HIV at levels comparable to the nation. In 2004, 51% of Alaskans reported ever being tested for HIV aside from testing for blood donation. Of thes e, 34% report being tested within the previous 12 months. In 2005, 47% of Alaskans reported ev er being tested for HIV (State of Alaska, 2006). The majority of HIV/AIDS cases reported in Al aska continue to occur among males, but the proportion of male cases has decreased over ti me. Between 1991 and 1995 there was an average of 48 newly diagnosed cases per year in males. Between 2001 and 2005 there was an average of 29 newly diagnosed cases in males each year an d males made up 73% of the newly diagnosed cases reported in that time period. HIV cases associated with men who have sex with men (including men with dual risks of sex with men and injection drug us e) continue to constitute the majority (56%) of recent cases among men. As is the case nationally, as the number of cases in men has declined over time, the proportion of cas es in women has increased. Women made up 17% of newly diagnosed cases in Alaska betw een 1991 and 1995. In the five year period of 2001 through 2005 women made up 27% of newly diagnosed cases. In the five year period of 1991 to 1995 there was an average of 10 cases in women newly diagnosed per year; in 2001 to 2005 there was an average of 11 cases per year. Heterosexual transmission accounts for 54% of the cases among women in Alaska diagnosed with HIV only (not AIDS) in the period of 2001 to 2005. In Alaska as in the nation, racial/eth nic minority populations are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. Unlike in the Lower 48, Alaska Natives/American Indians have the greatest disparity in HIV cases. This disparity has widened over the last five years, especially for Alaska Native women who make up 28% of the 39 cases of HIV-only diagnosed in women in the five year period of 2001-2005. While Alaska has been successful in reducing th e average number of newly diagnosed HIV cases over the past 15 years, the ultimate goal is to pr event new HIV infections. Alaska faces many of the same challenges to HIV prevention that c onfront the U.S. as a whole: engaging persons living with HIV in prevention services over the long run; recruiting high risk persons with low perception of risk to testing and prevention counseling; and finding fresh approaches to prevention for behavioral risk populations that may be experiencing HIV prevention fatigue or complacency. With geographic separation from the epicenters of the HIV epidemic, low HIV prevalence, and a widely dispersed and divers e population, Alaska faces ongoing challenges in keeping HIV appropriately in the forefront of hea lth concerns for those at risk and in extending prevention to match the reach of the virus. The 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan sets out strategies to address these challenges over the three year period of the Plan. 2 Chapter One: IntroductionThe 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan The 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan is the sixth comprehensive plan produced by the Alaska HIV Prevention Planning Group (HPPG) a nd the State of Alaska HIV/STD Program. This Plan describes the epidemiology of HIV/AI DS in Alaska and related risk factors, the populations at greatest need for HIV prevention interventions, and recommendations for interventions that are most approp riate to meet these needs. The Plan is designed to provide guidance for HIV prevention activities in all sectors and areas of Alaska for the next three years. It is intended to guide specific in terventions for t hose at greatest risk of HIV infection; to ge nerate community discussion and input; to encour age collaboration among individuals, organizations, and community groups providing HIV prevention and care; and to encourage integration of HIV prevention inte rventions into other services for people likely to engage in risk behaviors - all with th e goal of preventing HIV and AIDS in Alaska. This Plan considers epidemiologic data, HIV pr evention needs, resources and service gaps for the most affected populations, and the published research on, a nd program experience with, HIV prevention interventions. The resulting recomme ndations in the Plan are based on scientific evidence, local experience, and community values . The Plan guides the health department's annual application to Centers for Disease C ontrol and Prevention (CDC) for federal HIV prevention funds. With these and other funds, th e State HIV/STD Program and its grantees and contractors carry out the nine essential compone nts of the HIV prevention program for Alaska. Comprehensive HIV Preventi on Program Components The State of Alaska HIV/STD Program receives funding for HIV Prevention activities from the CDC. CDC defines a comprehe nsive HIV prevention program as including the following nine essential components: 1. HIV prevention community planning; 2. HIV prevention activities; a. HIV counseling, testing and referral services (CTR); b. Partner counseling and referral serv ices (PCRS) with strong linkages to prevention and care services; c. Prevention for HIV-infected persons; d. Health education and risk reduction (HE/RR) activities; e. Public information programs (if addressed in the jurisdiction's Prevention Plan); f. Perinatal transmission preven tion (for jurisdictions with 150 perinatal HIV cases); 3. Quality assurance; 4. Evaluation of major program activities, interventions, and services, as well as collection of data on interv entions and clients served; 5. Capacity-building activities; 6. Sexually transmitted disease prevention activities; 7. Collaboration and coordination with other related programs; 8. Laboratory support; and 3 Chapter One: Introduction9. HIV/AIDS epidemiologic a nd behavioral surveillance. The 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan is the culmination of the HIV prevention community planning work of the Alaska HPPG in 2005 and 2006 (component #1). The recommendations in the Plan guide the heal th department's implementation of the HIV prevention activities in Alaska (components #2a through e; f does not apply to Alaska). The HIV/STD Program and collaborating divisions of the Alaska Depart ment of Health and Social Services carry out or facilitate the remaining required component s of the state's comprehensive HIV prevention program. Advancing HIV Prevention Initiative In 2003, the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention launched the Advancing HIV Prevention Initiative (CDC, 2003) with the goal of reducing the number of new infections in the U.S. by increasing the number of persons who know their HIV status and connec ting persons with HIV to care and prevention services. The initiative proposed four strategies: Making HIV screening a routin e part of medical care; Implementing new models for diagnosing HIV inf ection, including the use of rapid testing; Improving and expanding prevention services for people living with HIV/AIDS; and Further decreasing perinatal HIV transmi ssion through routine, voluntary HIV testing during prenatal care. The 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan incorporates AHP strategies that are applicable to a state with low HIV prevalence. In addition, the Plan proposes strategies to raise community awareness of risk and acceptance of risk reducti on, and to reduce risk behaviors in HIV-negative individuals at high risk of HIV infection. Organization of the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan The 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan includes priority populations and a set of recommended interventions for each population. Populations are selected and prevention interventions are chosen so as to maximize the public health impact of the available prevention resources in order to prevent as many new infecti ons as possible. Key information that was used to develop the comprehensive HIV prevention plan is found in the epidemio lgic profile (Chapter 2) and the community services assessment (Chapter 3). The Plan is organized to incorporate the key products of a comprehensiv e plan as outlined in CDC's 2003-2008 HIV Prevention Community Planning Guidance. Chapter One offers an Introduction to HIV prevention successes and current challenges, components of an HIV prevention program, the national Advancing HIV Prevention Initiative, and an overview of the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan . 4 Chapter One: IntroductionChapter Two contains the Epidemiologic Profile , which describes the impact of the HIV epidemic in Alaska and other surrogate ma rkers for HIV risk behaviors (e.g., sexually transmitted disease, teen pregnancy rates, informa tion on drug use, and results of behavioral risk factors surveys in Alaska). Chapter Three describes the Community Services Assessment , which provides information on the prevention needs of populations at ri sk for HIV infection, the prevention activities/interventions implemented to address these needs, and service gaps. Chapter Four encapsulates the rationale for selecting the Priority Populations for 2007-2009. This chapter focuses on a set of populations identif ied for prevention efforts due to the impact of HIV infection in these popul ations and the prevalence of other risk factors. Chapter Five focuses on Interventions that have undergone scient ific evaluation and have demonstrated effectiveness in helping people make behavior changes to re duce their risk of HIV infection. The Alaska HIV Prevention Pla nning Group (HPPG) and the State of Alaska HIV/STD Program drew upon local experi ence, and knowledge of cultural/ethnic appropriateness, to select from among these in terventions those likely to best meet the HIV prevention needs of each of the priority populations. Chapter Six presents the Recommendations of the Alaska HIV Prevention Planning Group (HPPG) for prevention activities statewide and for interventions specific to each priority population. This chapter also describes activities to be carried out by the health department in the areas of quality assurance, evaluation, capacity building, and other elements of a comprehensive HIV prevention program. Chapter Seven is an Overview of the Community Planning Process . This chapter discusses the Alaska HPPG and their major goals and guideline s set by the CDC, as well as community input processes. 5 Chapter One: IntroductionChapter 2 Epidemiologic Prole 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention PlanChapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile Summary This chapter presents a brief summary of the Epidemiologic Profile on HIV/AIDS in Alaska included in Appendix A. The first case of AIDS was reported in Alas ka in 1982, before the human immunodeficiency virus had been recognized as the cause of AIDS and before a laboratory test to detect antibodies to HIV had been developed. By December 31, 2005, a total of 1,048 cases of HIV, with and without AIDS, had been reported in Alaska. Da ta presenting characteristics of these cases follow, and should be interpreted in the cont ext of cumulative scien tific knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Table 1. Cumulative HIV and AIDS Cases Repo rted to the Alaska Division of Public Health through December 31, 2005 N=1,048 Total HIV & AIDS Cases Reported In Alaska HIV & AIDS Cases Not Known to Have Died HIV & AIDS Cases Known to Have Died HIV Cases with AIDS 730 411 319 HIV Cases without AIDS 318 293 25 Total Reported HIV/AIDS Cases 1,048 704 344 The cumulative total of HIV cases (with and wi thout AIDS) and known deaths due to any cause are shown in Figure 1. In this gr aph, a death in a person with HI V is shown in the year the case was first diagnosed (rather than the year in whic h the death actually occu rred) to better illustrate case mortality. 6 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile SummaryFigure 1.

Beginning in 1996, the number of HIV -related deaths per year declined significantly in Alaska as well as in the U.S., primarily due to advan ces in medical care and the development of antiretroviral medications. The decline in deat hs, combined with ongoing occurrence of new infections, resulted in a steady increase in the number of persons living with HIV (Figure 1). Needs for medical care, supportiv e services, and ongoing prevention services will continue to grow as persons with HIV live longer, healthier lives. Rates of occurrence of HIV/AIDS from 2001-2005 (H IV incidence) in Alaska and the U.S. are presented below in Figure 2. HIV incidence rates in Alaska during this pe riod were considerably lower than those in the U.S. as a whole. In this graph, Alaska HIV cas es are defined as cases reported in individuals who were Alaska residents at their first known date of HIV/AIDS diagnosis. Case rates are expressed per 100,000 population. 7 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile SummaryFigure 2.

This was true throughout the U.S. Females - Of 1,048 cumulative HIV cases reporte d in Alaska through 2005, 202 cases (19%) were in females. The average number of HIV cas es per year among females in Alaska increased in periods beginning in 1982 through 2000 (from an av erage of 1 case per year to an average of 14 cases per year), then decreased for the peri od from 2001-2005 (to an average of 11 cases per year). The proportion of total cases occurring in females increased steadily over time, from 8% to 27%. In recent periods this proportionate increase was due primarily to a decline in the number and proportion of cases in males (Table 2). Males - Of 1,048 cumulative Alaska HIV cases, 846 cas es (81%) were in males. The average number of HIV/AIDS cases per year newly diagnosed in males decreased in time periods after 1990 (Table 2). 8 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile SummaryTable 2.

Age Of total cumulative HIV cases reported in Alaska, the largest number (214; 20% of the total) was in persons aged 30-34 years at in itial HIV diagnosis. Overall, 741 (71%) HIV cases occurred in individuals who were between the ages of 25-44 years at the time of their initial HIV diagnosis. Unlike some other areas of the U.S., relativ ely few HIV cases were reported among very young people in Alaska: 13 (1%) of 1,048 cases were aged 0-14, 23 (2%) were aged 15-19, and 111 (11%) were aged 20-24 years at time of initial HIV diagnosis (Figure 3). 9 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile SummaryFigure 3.

Male-to-male sexual contact (MSM) represented, by far, the largest single risk for infection both for the total population of persons reported with HIV infection in Alaska through December 31, 2005 (48% of all cumulative cases) and for males only (59% of male cases). Injection drug use (IDU) as a single transmission category accounte d for 14% of cumulative HIV cases (12% of cases in males and 22% of cases in female s). HIV cases with both MSM and IDU risks accounted for an additional 7% of total cases. Heterosexual contact to a person at increased risk for HIV (for example, a known HIV-positive, an IDU, or, for females, a bisexual male) accounted for 15% of total cumulati ve cases (6% of cases in males and 51% of cases in females). The proportions of total cumulative HIV cases rela ted to perinatal transmission, transfusion or transplantation, or receipt of blood products for hemophilia were low at 1%, each.

Alt hough individuals are not at risk of HIV infection due to their race/ethnicity, it is sometim es an indicator of economic and social factors that may influence risk of expos ure to HIV. Of the 1,048 cases reported through 12/31/05, 606 (58%) were in Whites, 238 (23%) in Alaska Natives/American Indians, 98 (9%) in Blacks, 73 (7%) in Hispanics, 20 (2%) in Asian/ Pacific Islanders, and 13 (1%) were of unknown race/ethnicity. Data on race/ethnicity for all cu mulative HIV cases are presented in Figure 5. 11 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile (n=73) Figure 5. Cumulative HIV Cases (with and without AIDS) by Race/Ethnicity through December 31, 2005, Alaska N=1,048 Data on HIV/AIDS by gender and r ace/ethnicity are presented in Tables 3 and 4 for males and females 15 years of age or older, as are Alas ka population estimates. This age range was selected to make the data more comparable acr oss racial/ethnic groups. Few HIV cases occur in individuals younger than 15 years, but the number of individuals in th e population that are younger than 15 years of age is large and unevenly distributed across the di fferent racial/ethnic groups. Data are presented separately for male s and females because th e proportions of females and males differ across racial/ethnic groups. Please note that the HIV case data classify individuals of Hispanic ethnic ity as a separate racial/ethnic category while the Alaska population data include individuals of Hisp anic ethnicity within the four race categories. Population data for individuals of Hispanic ethnic ity are also separately shown in brackets [ ] in Tables 3 and 4. 12 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile SummaryTable 3.

At the time of their first HIV diagnosis in Alaska, 672 cases (64%) reported a residence of Anchorage/Mat Su, the most populous region of the state (53% of the state populat ion resided in the Anchorage/Mat Su region in 2005). A total of 747 HIV cases (71%) resided in the urban areas of Anchorage, Fairbanks or Juneau (60% of the state's 2005 population) at the time of th eir first HIV/AIDS diagnosis in Alaska. People with HIV infection may have no noticeable symptoms for years after initial infection and may not seek medical care leading to a diagnos is for an extended period. Additionally, many individuals are highly mobile. The following data must therefor e be interpreted with caution. An individual's residence at the time he or sh e was first diagnosed with HIV infection is not necessarily the area where infecti on initially occurred or the area where the infected individual currently resides or seek s care, if still living. Figure 6. Region of Residence* at Time of First HIV/AIDS Diagnosis in Alaska, Cumulative Cases Reported through December 31, 2005, Alaska N=1,048 *Note: Region of residence is defined as re gion of residence at first HIV diagnosis, when known, the region of residence at fir st AIDS diagnosis when the residence at HIV diagnosis is unknown, and the region of fi rst case report when residence at HIV and AIDS diagnosis are unknown ANCHORAGE/MAT-SU (n=672 ) (<1%) Residence Unknown 14 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile SummaryHIV Cases Presumed to be Living Of the 1,048 HIV/AIDS reported through December 31, 2005, 704 were not known to have died. Data presented below assumed all of these cases were still living, although that is unlikely (some undoubtedly moved and died while residents of anot her state). Characteristics of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV) in Alaska were simila r to those of persons living with HIV/AIDS in the U.S., with the exception of race/ethnicity. Th e data on transmission categories are difficult to compare because CDC's estimated U.S. data st atistically redistribute cases with \"no risk identified\" into the other transmission categor ies, while cases in this category are shown separately in the Alaska data. Of all PLWHIV, 78% of cases reported in Alaska were male, and 73% of U.S. adult/adolescent cases were male. The largest single proportion of PLWHIV in Alas ka and in the U.S. was in the age group of 40-44 years (22% for each). Of male PLWHIV, 56% of Alaska and 60% of U. S. cases were in MSM; 14% of Alaska and 19% of U.S. cases were in I DU; 7% of Alaska and 13% of U.S. cases were exposed through heterosexual contact; and 8% of Alaska and 7% of U.S. cases were in MSM who also were IDU. Of female PLWHIV, 55% of Alaska and 71% of U.S. PLWHIV were exposed through heterosexual contact; and 18% of Alaska and 27% of U.S. PLWHIV were exposed through IDU. The proportions of the Alaska population by race di ffer from those of the U.S., and proportions of PLWHIV likewise differ: 58% of Alaska a nd 34% of U.S. PLWHIV were White; 23% of Alaska and less than 1% of U.S. PLWHIV we re Alaska Native/American Indian; 9% of Alaska and 48% of U. S. PLWHIV were Black; 7% of Al aska and 17% of U.S. PLWHIV were Hispanic; and 2% of Alaska and less th an 1% of U.S. PLWHIV were Asian/Pacific Islander. HIV Cases with Recent and Earlier HIV Infections Characteristics of cases infected with HIV more recently may differ from those infected in years past, potentially indicating changes in populations at risk over time. In order to allow for comparison, given the small case numbers in Alaska , data on HIV infections that were first diagnosed from 2001-2005 and had not progressed to AIDS were selected as indicators of \"recent\" HIV infections. Cases infected \"earlier \" were represented by all cases of HIV without AIDS diagnosed prior to 2001 and all cases of HIV with AIDS. Of the 1,048 HIV cases reported through Decem ber 31, 2005, 118 met the definition of recent cases (cases diagnosed between 2001-2005 withou t progression to AIDS). Of these 118 recent HIV cases, 79 (67%) were in males and 39 (33%) we re in females. Of 930 earlier HIV/AIDS cases, 767 (82%) were in males and 163 (18%) were in females. The proportion of males (67%) was slightly less, and the pr oportion of females slightly gr eater (33%) among recent cases reported in Alaska than in 2004 cases reported in the 42 U.S. areas with confidential name-based HIV reporting (70% among males and 30% among females). Recent cases in males in Alaska 15 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile Summarywere slightly older than earlier male cases whil e the age distribution of recent female cases in Alaska was similar to that of earlier cases. Transmission risk for the greatest proportion of recent and earlier cases in males was male-to- male sexual contact, but the proportion was smal ler for recent (53%) as compared to earlier (60%) cases. Transmission risk for the greatest proportion of recent and earlier cases in females was heterosexual contact to a person with or at increased risk for HI V, and the proportion was greater for recent (54%) than for earlier (51%) cases. A majority of all recent and earlier HIV cases ha d a residence of Anchorage/Mat-Su at the time of first HIV diagnosis in Alas ka, although the proporti on with this residence was smaller in recent cases (54%) than in earlier cases (65%). HIV Testing in Alaska In 2005, 47% of Alaskans aged 18-64 years report ed ever having had an HIV test, as compared to 38% of the U.S. population. The percentage of persons who report ev er being tested has consistently been slightly higher in Alaska than in the U.S. (T hese data were drawn from the annual Behavioral Risk Surveillance System in Alaska and nationwide.) Prenatal testing reaches many Alaska women of childbearing age. In 2003, 80% of women delivering live infants in Alas ka recalled their provider discu ssing prenatal HIV testing with them, and were likely to have received HIV scre ening as part of their prenatal care. This proportion is consistent with t hose in earlier years (ranging from 76%-82% between 1999-2002). There were 48,542 births in Alas ka from 1999-2003. (These data were drawn from the annual Alaska Pregnancy Risk Asse ssment Monitoring Survey.) Of 12,291 individuals tested for HIV in 2005 th rough the State Virology Laboratory, 11 (0.09%) were HIV positive. Identifying HIV Infection Earl y in the Course of Disease From 2001-2005, 36% of individuals with Alaska re sidence at the time of their initial HIV diagnosis developed AIDS within 12 months of their in itial HIV diagnosis. This likely indicates diagnosis late in the course of their HIV disease. Comparable data for the U.S. show that of all HIV infections diagnosed in 2003, 39% progres sed to AIDS within 12 months after HIV infection was diagnosed. Although a number of individuals with HIV are presumed to be unaware of their infection, HIV screening of the general population in Alaska has not been ve ry effective in identifying people with previously undiagnosed HIV infection. Diffe rent models of targeted outreach associated with testing, some using rapid HIV tests, are bein g explored to identify ways to best reach those at risk. Partner notification act ivities, working with persons di agnosed with HIV to contact and offer HIV testing to their sexual and needle-sharing partners, remain the most effective means of 16 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile Summaryreaching persons at highest risk prior to symptomatic disease. From 2003-2005, partner notification activities identified 37% of all cases of HIV newly diagnosed in Alaska. STD as Indicators of HIV Risk Sexually transmitted diseases/infections (STD) i ndicate unprotected sex and potential risk for HIV infection. Individuals with STD are at incr eased risk of acquiring HIV, if exposed through unprotected sex, or of transmitti ng HIV sexually if they have HIV infection. A total of 4,357 cases of chlamydia and 601 cases of gonorrhea were reported in Alaska in 2005, and the chlamydia infection rate in Alaska was one of th e highest in the U.S. Fortunately, HIV infection occurred much less frequently, and relatively fe w individuals ever repor ted with chlamydia or gonorrhea infections were ever reported with HIV through December 31, 2005. The number of infectious syphilis cases in Alaska, although sma ll in 2004-2005, was the greatest it had been for many years. In contrast to the situation w ith gonorrhea or chlamydia, 30% of the 26 persons identified with infectious s yphilis in 2004-2005 had HIV infection or had a recent HIV exposure. 17 Chapter Two: Epidemiologic Profile SummaryChapter 3 Community Services Assessment 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment A Community Services Assessment (CSA) is a description of the prevention needs of populations at risk for HIV infec tion, the prevention se rvices available to address these needs, and service gaps. The HIV Commu nity Planning Guide defines the three elements of a CSA as: Needs Assessment - information on the curren t status and service needs of a defined population or geographic area. Needs that may be identified include indications of risk behaviors, service utilizati on and barriers to services. Resource Inventory - current HIV prevention an d related resources a nd activities including information regarding HIV prevention activ ities and other education and prevention activities, regardless of funding source, that are likely to contribut e to HIV risk reduction. Gap analysis - a description of the unmet HIV prevention needs within the high-risk populations defined in the epidemiologic profile. Development of the Comprehensive Prevention Plan involves comparing needs against the activities and services available to meet those needs, and the f unding sources of those activities and services, in order to proj ect what service gaps would ex ist in the 2007 to 2009 period and therefore should to be addressed in recommendations in the Plan. Funding for HIV Prevention in Alaska There are four main funding sour ces for HIV prevention in Alaska: (1) State HIV prevention grants and contracts using federal funds from the CDC HIV Prevention Cooperative Agreement are administered by the HIV/STD Program, awarded on a competitive basis, and are usually funded on a three year cycle with annual review and renewal. The current grant cy cle is through the end of the State fiscal year 2007 (June 30, 2007). The next grant cycle will be July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2010. (2) HIV-specific Services Directly Funded by Federal Agencies refer to HIV prevention or care programs funded directly to an agency or orga nization by a federal agency such as the CDC or the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRS A) which funds Ryan White CARE grants and Special Projects of Nati onal Significance (SPNS) for research on HIV prevention and care services. (3) State-funded Services refer to prevention related activities that are incorporated into programs of state agencies, but that are not funded specificall y for HIV prevention under the CDC HIV prevention cooperative agreement, su ch as substance abuse treatment programs, Department of Corrections programming for in mates, and most Public Health Center services. (4) Non-public Funding Sources refer to private foundations and fund raising activities by community-based organizations. Non-publicly funded HIV prevention services are very limited in Alaska. The State of Alaska receives federal funds fo r HIV prevention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The period of the curre nt cooperative agreement with CDC is January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2008. In 2006, the annual award was $1,417,619. With annual 18 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment rescissions by CDC, this represen ts a decrease of 4.4% over the la st three years. The State does not anticipate any increase in federal funding ove r the next three years and additional rescissions and increasing costs may further erode resources for HIV prevention. No State general funds are specifically allocated for HIV prevention at the present time. Of the $1.4 million in HIV prevention funds, 47% goes to grants and contract s for prevention interven tions for the priority populations identified in the 2004-2006 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan ; approximately 13% goes to HIV partner services and HIV c ounseling and testing provided by St ate public health personnel; and 40% covers program administ ration, planning and evaluation. In state fiscal year 2006, of the 47% in grants and contracts, 18% were al located to prevention activities for HIV positive persons; 25% for prevention prog rams for men who have sex with men, 19% for women at increased risk, especially women in race/ethnic gr oups that are overrepresented in the HIV cases in Alaska; 6% for injection drug users; 9% for high risk youth, and 7% for incarcerated persons in community residential centers (halfway houses). An additional 16% of prevention funds were allocated for STD partner services for persons diagnosed with a repor table STD (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis) and their sex partners. Grants and contracts are awarded on a competitiv e basis for a three year period with annual review and renewal. The 2005 through 2007 grant cycle will end June 30, 2007. Thus, the needs now met by the HIV prevention services curre ntly funded through the State to community organizations will become unmet needs in mid-2007. The Alaska HIV Prevention Planning Group had this funding cycle in mind when asse ssing unmet needs for the period covered by the HIV + 18% MSM 25% Women STD 16% Figure 7. FY 2006 Grants and Contracts for HIV Prevention by Intended Population. 19 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment new plan starting January 2007. In early 2007, th e State will issue a new request for proposals (RFP) for HIV prevention. The RFP will solic it applications for HIV prevention programs for the priority populations and inte rventions recommended in the 2007 to 2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan . Grant awards to successful applicants responding to the RFP will determine the State-funded interventions to be carried out by community organizations for the period July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2010.

These include federally funded projects primarily for HIV prevention as well as federal and state funded programs that address risk factors associat ed with HIV such as su bstance abuse or sexual activity and that incorporate an HIV prevention component into their client services. These sources of federal funding have varying funding cycles and duration. Most grants in place in 2006 end in mid-2007 (see Table 5). Notable excep tions are the funding fo r \"Let's Talk\", an abstinence only curriculum for middle schoo l students funded through September 2008, and the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium's adap tation of the Community Promise model directly funded by CDC for HIV prevention in Bethel and surrounding villages funded through mid- 2009. 21 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment Alaska Native Tribal He alth Consortium (ANTHC) Funding Source: HRSA Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Funding Cycle: July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2007 Amount: $200,000 annually Project Contact: Sherry Trigg 907 729-3951 Project Description: The purpose of this project is to provide cap acity building assistance to Norton Sound Health Corporation (including Nome and 15 villages) to conduct risk reducti on counseling and HIV counseling and testing (HIVCT). In addition, this project has conducted community education presentations to increase HIV awareness and gene rate interest in test ing. The project has facilitated training for NSHC Behavioral Health Providers in Nome and v illages to conduct risk assessment and risk reduction counseling with clie nts and then refer them to the hospital lab for serologic HIV testing. Alaska Native Tribal He alth Consortium (ANTHC) Funding Source: CDC direct funding to Comm unity Based Organizations Funding Cycle: July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2009 Amount: $355,197 annually Project Contact: Michael Covone 907 729-3646 Project Description : The goal of the project is to increase HIV tes ting by increasing risk perception and directing persons to testing services. The project is an adaptation of the Commun ity Promise intervention model with the addition of community readin ess assessments to gauge community knowledge and attitudes regarding HIV prevention. The proj ect was initiated in Bethel and may expand to selected Yukon-Kuskokwim regional villages. Th ey are implementing outreach in Bethel using role model stories to promote HIV testing, and developing the capacity of Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation village behavioral health paraprofessionals to act as HIV prevention resources. Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporatio n (YKHC) Circle of Care Project Funding Source: HRSA Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Funding Cycle: July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2007 Funding: $200,000 annually Project Contact: Carl Evans 907 543-6486 Project Description: The first goal of the Circle of Care is to incr ease the number of indivi duals living in the Yukon- Kuskokwim Delta who know their HIV status. The s econd goal is to train health care workers to increase knowledge and skill level. The thir d goal involves community education about HIV/AIDS issues that influence wellness. This project conducts community education presentations and HIVCT (with risk re duction counseling) using the OraQuick HIV rapid test in Bethel and self-selected villag es in the YK region. Four villag es participate in the research component of the grant looking at the effect of community educa tion on the use of HIV testing. Seven additional villages have received commun ity presentations. A total of 229 persons in Bethel and participating villages have received HIV testing thr ough the project; none have tested positive for HIV. In addition, the project has he lped YKHC to introduce ra pid testing into their clinical services and there has been an increase in HIV serolo gic testing at the YKHC hospital. 22 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment Crisis Pregnancy Center - Let's Talk Program Funding Source: HRSA Special Projects of Regional a nd National Significance - Community Based Abstinence Education (SPRANS - CBAE) Funding Cycle: September 30, 2005 through September 30, 2008 Funding: $663,845 annually Project Contact: Carol Kidwell 907 868-5033 Project website : www.letstalkalaska.com Project Description: The goal of Crisis Pregnancy Center's Let's Talk program is to educate, empower, and encourage youth throughout Alaska to apply the information they receive about the significance of building healthy relationships and the benefits of abstai ning from sexual relations until marriage. The program has three objectives: 1) to reach 50 communities per year and teach abstinence and discuss sexually transmitted infections; 2) to assist 20 communities (5 rural, 15 urban) in developing their own abstinence- only education program; and 3) to develop capacity and to serve as a resource.

University of Alaska, Behavioral Health Research and Services, Exploring HIV Prevention in Brief Alcohol Detox Programs Funding Source: National Institute on Alc ohol Abuse and Alcoholism Funding Cycle: October 2004 to September 2007 Amount: $125,000 Year One; $150,000 Year Two; Christiane Brems, Ph.D., ABPP; 907-561-2880 Project Description : This is a research project to explore the use of brief adaptations of motivational interviewing (BMI) in a new venue (brief alc ohol detoxification), w ith high-risk individuals who traditionally have had limited access to HIV prevention interv entions. It uses BMI for HIV/STD prevention with this underserved group of i ndividuals who are not yet likely to be motivated to address the issue of HIV/STD prevention. Biological feedback (results of STD testing) is used to enhance 25 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment motivational impact. Participants are culturally diverse (45% Alaska Native). During Phase One the project developed session outlines and intervention manuals through focus groups and key informant interviews. During Phase Two, the project is testing the feasibility and utility of the novel application of brief motiva tional interventions to HIV pr evention in culturally diverse clients in brief alcohol detoxifi cation treatment. Thr ee intervention op tions enroll 25 individuals per condition and have a 3-month follow-up: (a) Risk Assessment Intervention : participants respond to a standard risk assessment protoc ol, receive standard HIV/STD risk reduction information and referral to community services; (b) Motivational Interviewing Intervention : participants respond to a risk assessment protocol and receive an HIV/STD prevention intervention based on brief adaptations of motiva tional interviewing, including personalized risk feedback, personalized risk reduction plans, beha vioral skills training, an d referral to relevant community services; and (c) Motivational Interviewi ng and Biological Feedback Intervention : participants receive interv ention (b) AND pre-test counse ling AND provide a biological specimen for STD testing, followed by post-test c ounseling, STD test feedback, and referral for treatment. All individuals will be assessed after three months. 26 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment Table 6.

The majority (60%) of the population resides in the three urban communities of Anc horage, Fairbanks, and Juneau and the majority of HIV/AIDS cases are in person s who resided in one of these cities at the time of diagnosis. HIV infection has historically b een, and continues to be, more prevalent in the more populous areas of Alaska, although all geographi c areas of the state are affected to some degree. Risk behaviors among peop le in the urban centers, either by individuals who reside in these areas or who travel to the cities from outlying areas, are th erefore more likely to involve exposure to HIV than in areas with lower pr evalence of HIV infection. Most of the HIV prevention interventions with evidence of effectiv eness are feasible only in settings where there are sufficient numbers of persons in the intended population. The size of the priority population 27 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment with demographic and behavioral risk factors in common, for example, in jection drug users, men who have sex with men, and wome n with identifiable risk factor s, and their concentration in identifiable locations, make certain interventi ons like targeted outre ach and group sessions feasible in the urban setting. Ur ban centers may also have concen trations of target populations whose members interact with sufficient frequenc y to make it possible to influence community norms about HIV risk reduction. The three urba n centers also have sufficient populations of persons affected by HIV to have dedicated AIDS service organizations that offer a continuum of HIV care and prevention services and can em ploy staff who specialize in HIV prevention. Mid-sized rural hubs and some of the boroughs adj acent to urban centers ha ve health and social service resources that can incorporate HIV preventi on into existing services that reach persons at risk such as in substance abuse treatment f acilities, public health c linics, and correctional facilities. Alaska Native regi onal health corporations based in rural hubs provide the health infrastructure to incorporate prevention into the care of beneficiaries liv ing with HIV, provide HIV counseling and testing, reproduc tive health care including STD diagnosis and treatment, and in some instances, conduct projects dedicated to HIV prevention. Howe ver, in less populous areas of the state, the smaller num bers of people, particularly t hose in the priority populations based on behavioral risk factors, as well as lower HIV prevalence, often preclude establishment of AIDS specific organizations or prevention programs focused exclusively or predominantly on HIV and staffed by HIV prevention specialists. In these areas, the intensive interventions of partner notification and prevention case manage ment for HIV-positive persons can be provided for the small number of persons for whom they are appropriate. However, other HIV prevention activities generally must rely he avily on agencies and organizati ons with broader missions that can integrate HIV prevention into counseling or health education services for their clients and communities. Lower population density, lower HI V prevalence, social dynamics and cultural factors of rural communities make it difficult to provide HIV prevention activities that target persons with acknowledged, specified behavioral risk factor such as injection drug use or sex between men. In rural areas, most HIV prevention efforts must reach out to a broader audience of persons potentially at risk to raise awareness of risk and provi de referrals to individualized services for the fewer in dividuals at higher risk.

Prevention services are organized by funding source. The services described are those in effect in 2006. HIV-Positive Persons Indication of Need The Ryan White CARE grant 2006 Statewide Coordi nated Statement of Need (SCSN) identifies three overarching issues for pers ons living with HIV in Alaska: 1. The changing nature of HIV disease. Ne w therapies and medical technologies have prolonged health and life for many persons living with HIV (PLWHIV), making HIV a long term, chronic illness. These changes have also made HIV a very complex illness for providers and patients to manage. 2. The changing populations affected by HIV. Individuals with HIV are increasingly drawn from socially and economically marginal ized populations, an d many PLWHIV have complex co-existing medical and social needs. 3. Many potential barriers exist to effective par ticipation in HIV care. Comprehensive care is unevenly available in differe nt geographic areas of the stat e and within different care systems. Some services are not fully inte grated and various serv ices have different eligibility requirements. Barriers posed by high costs of care, geographic distances, differences in culture, differences in langua ge, competing family or other demands, and real or perceived stigma impede some individuals from accessing services. To the extent that a lower HIV viral load reduces the risk of HIV transm ission, adherence to HIV medications contributes to HIV prevention. The 2006 SCSN note s that adherence to prescribed medication regimens is difficult for many, if not all PLWHIV, due to the nature of the medications (timing, with/without food, drug inter actions, sheer quantities of pills, etc.) and these medications' many toxicities . Individuals with substance a buse or mental health problems may have additional difficulties with adherence or providers may be reluctant to prescribe certain HIV medications for them at all. Programs to support adherence are lim ited. Currently, the private pharmacy that provides AIDS Drug Assi stance Program (ADAP) services and the ANHC and ANTHC Title III projects all assist patients with adherence. Additional efforts to support adherence (including opportunitie s for monitored or directly observed therapy as medication regimens are simplified) are needed. Mental health problems affect adherence and a person's ability to adopt and maintain safer behaviors. According to the 2006 SDSN, PLWHIV with co-existing mental health problems face special challenges. Title II and Title III providers estimate that anywhere from 35% to 80% of the PLWHIV in care are in need of some level of mental health services. Not all individuals 31 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment will seek services. The stigma surrounding mental health problems may be perceived as more damaging than those related to HIV. This may be especially true for some rural residents who need to access itinerant providers for mental heal th services. To make mental health counseling more accessible and normalize mental health servi ces the lead agency for one Title II consortium offers counseling at its office. Persons with mo re severe mental health problems have more subsidized service options availa ble to them, but continuity of care may be an issue. Persons with mental illness and disruptive behaviors have limited service options. PLWHIV with substance abuse problems face special challenges to follow medical care schedules and medication regimens. Substance a buse also increases the risk of engaging in transmission risk behaviors. Acco rding to Title II and III providers, alcohol is the most prevalent drug of abuse for Alaska PLWHIV and case manage rs have identified that from 80 to almost 100% of clients have substance use issues. Treatm ent services are available in most areas of the state, although the different levels and types of tr eatment are not uniformly available in all areas. Some individual factors may not be well accommoda ted (for example, lengths of stay may be prescribed rather than individually establishe d, services may not be perceived as culturally sensitive, child care may be unavailable to thos e who need it), and some treatment services (both inpatient and outpatient) have wait lists. A ccess to treatment is problematic for substance abusing individuals with HIV dementia an d/or who have disruptive behaviors. Other needed support services may be negatively affected by a person's substance abuse problem and may indirectly complicate medical care a nd prevention (for example, public housing has a zero tolerance for substance abus e and abusers may be evicted) . Many clients need supportive aftercare and ongoing counseling afte r substance abuse treatment to assist them in controlling their substance abuse, and special services ma y be needed to support adherence to HIV (and other) medical regimens. When individuals face delays for admission to substance abuse treatment, case managers must assist clients to stay in care while wai ting, which may be very challenging. HIV positive persons who are not accessing medi cal care are not likely to be accessing prevention services. Factors that contribute to avoidance of care, identified by Title II and III providers, include: Perceived stigma associated with disclosing HIV status, Residence in areas where services are not re adily available necessitating travel that is complicated by cost and competing needs, and substance abuse issues or disruptive behaviors. PLWHIV released from incarceration in correctional settings in Anchorage receive logistic and financial assistance to access medical care and me dications, as well as other supportive services upon release. This pre-release case management is not routinely availabl e across the correctional system in other areas of the state. CDC estimates that 25% of persons infected with HIV have not b een tested and are thus unaware of their HIV status. Diagnosis as early as possibl e is critical for initiati ng care to prevent disease progression and to decrease dise ase transmission. In Alaska, HI V partner services have proven to be the most effective mechanism for iden tifying previously undiagnos ed cases of HIV. 32 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment Partner notification and the offer of immediat e, field-based HIV counseling and testing can facilitate earlier diagnosis of HI V infection and provide prevention counseling to those at risk of transmitting HIV. Of all newly reported cas es of HIV/AIDS in 2003, 2004 and 2005, 37%, 44% and 24% respectively were first iden tified through partner services. HIV and STD co-morbidity may increase the risk of HIV transmission. Low cost, accessible services for STD diagnosis and treatment make an important contribution to HIV prevention by (a) reducing STD morbidity which is a risk fact or for HIV transmission and (b) reaching persons for whom HIV counseling and tes ting may be appropriate who might not otherwise seek out HIV testing and risk reduction counseling. Prevention Services State-funded Interventions under the CDC Cooperative Agreement Partner services, including fiel d-based HIV counseling and tes ting, carried out by the HIV/STD Program are funded under the CDC Cooperative Ag reement through 2008. In Anchorage, the Alaskan AIDS Assistance Association has implemented the Healthy Relationships multi-session group prevention intervention and an adaptation of the MPowerme nt model with outreach and single group sessions for persons living with HI V. The Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center receives prevention funding to provide preven tion case management and individual health education/risk reduction (HE/RR) in the context of medical care at ANHC. The Municipality of Anchorage Reproductive Health Clinic is f unded under the CDC Cooperative Agreement to conduct HIV counseling and testing in community se ttings and to conduct STD partner services and testing. HIV prevention funds also part ially support public health nursing positions (historically in Fairbanks, Juneau and Bethel ) to provide HIV couns eling and testing and HIV/STD partner services. HIV-specific Services Directly Funded by Federal Agencies The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act authorizes federal funding to (1) increase the availa bility of primary health care and support services, (2) reduce utilization of more costly inpa tient care, (3) increase access to care for underserved populations, and (4) improve the quality of lif e for persons living with HIV di sease. Several entities in Alaska receive funding under different parts of the CARE Act. Title II CARE Act funds the State of Alaska to purchase medical services, me dications, and supportive services such as case management that assist low income PLWHIV/AIDSA to participate in medical care. The Four A's, with offices in Juneau and Anchorage, receives Title II CARE funds to serve clients statewide except for Fairbanks and surrounding In terior communities that are served by the Interior AIDS Association in Fairbanks. CARE services include a prevention counseling component and other support services that he lp HIV-positive persons reduce their risk of transmission. There are two recipients of Ryan White Title III Early Intervention Services (EIS) funding in Alaska, the Anchorage Neighborhood Health Cent er (ANHC) and the Al aska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC). ANHC provide s comprehensive primary health care for individuals living with HIV disease. Title III services include: ri sk-reduction counseling, antibody testing, medical evaluation, and clinical care; antiretrovira l therapies; protection against opportunistic infections; and ongoing medical, oral health, nutriti onal, psychosocial, and other care services for HIV-infected clients; case ma nagement to ensure access to services and 33 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment continuity of care for HIV-infected clients; a nd attention to other hea lth problems that occur frequently with HIV infection, includi ng tuberculosis and substance abuse. ANTHC receives Ryan White Titl e III funding for Early Interventi on Services to develop and provide HIV/AIDS case management, and treatmen t for Alaskan Natives and rural Alaskans. A centralized clinical team is lo cated in Anchorage, and hub site coordinators in Anchorage, Bethel, Fairbanks, Juneau, and Sitka provide re gional case management. The EIS team provides program services, such as consul tation, collaborative patient case management, and HIV clinics. Case management for HIV-positive patients in cludes prevention counseling in addition to coordination and referrals for me dical and counseling services. State-funded Services The State Virology Laboratory provides HIV antibody and confirmatory tests at no cost to public or private providers. HIV counseling and testin g, and STD diagnosis and treatment are provided at most state-funded Public Health Nursing Center s and by public health nurses at tribal health clinics under PL93-638 contracts with the state. Public health nurses also work closely with HIV/STD Program staff to carry out partner notification activities in rural communities. Service Gaps Supportive services are needed to assist persons with HIV over the long run to adopt and maintain healthy behaviors that prevent transm ission of HIV and preven t progression to AIDS. Behavioral intervention models, such as Healthy Relationships, specifically designed for HIV- positive persons are currently only available in Anchorage. The challenge is to provide a variety of prevention services in order to sustain interest and availabi lity over time. Funding for these programs under the State's CDC cooperative agreemen t expires in mid-2007 after which this will be a gap in prevention services. Outside of Anchorage, group interventions are not feasible due to low HIV/AIDS prevalence and consumer concerns about disclosure. Client -centered individual pr evention counseling is needed. Individual risk reduction counseling fo r HIV positive persons in the context of Ryan White CARE services is availa ble in Fairbanks and Juneau, a nd in two rural hubs (Sitka and Bethel) served by the Alaska Native Tribal He alth Consortium Early Intervention Services. HIV and STD partner services must continue uninterrupted statew ide. Current funding for HIV and STD partner services conducted by the HI V/STD Program expires in December 2008. Funding for HIV/STD partner services conducted by grantees expires mid-2007. Assessment of the prevention needs and preferences of HIV positive persons is needed on an ongoing basis to guide future prevention efforts. 34 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment Men Who Have Sex With Men Indication of Need Yearly incident HIV cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) and the outbreak of syphilis in Alaska between 2004 and 2006 indicate that unprotected sex continues to be a risk factor (MSM). Men with newly diagnosed HIV infection who name as partners men who have been previously diagnosed with HIV indicate ei ther that disclosure of HIV status is not a community norm and/or there is complacency about transmission risk. Partner notification ac tivities conducted by the HIV/STD Pr ogram indicate that a number of HIV-positive men and the men they name as sex partners do not identify as gay. Such individuals may not regard as relevant me ssages or interventions aimed at gay men. Prevention Services State-funded Interventions under the CDC Cooperative Agreement The Four A's in Anchorage provides HIV prev ention to young adult MSM in Anchorage through an intervention based on the MPow erment model developed by th e Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (listed in the CDC Compendium of Interventions wi th Evidence of Effectiveness ). MPowerment is a peer-led program that seek s to address the needs of young gay and bisexual men by providing HIV prevention within the contex t of social activities, formal and informal outreach, a safe community center or gathering spot, and small gr oup sessions. Peer volunteers conduct outreach in bars, adult bookstores, public sex environments, and through Internet chat rooms, reaching MSM including those who do not identify as gay. In 2005, the MPowerment project made 8,200 outreach contacts with me n; 96 young men participated in groups. The Municipality of Anchorage conducts targ eted HIV counseling and testing in non-clinic settings readily accessible to men in conj unction with the MPowerment Project outreach activities. In 2005, 151 MSM received HIV couns eling and testing in community settings. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium pr ovides an adaptation of the MPowerment model for HIV prevention for Alaska Native MSM in Anchorage and an adaptation of the POL outreach model for rural MSM in selected re gional hub communities. In 2005, there were 1,450 outreach contacts from the two projects and 75 men participated in group sessions. HIV Partner Services conducted by public health personnel from the HIV/STD program provides prevention counseling and care re ferrals to MSM whose HIV/AIDS diagnosis is newly reported and then provides notification and HIV counseling and testing for named partners. This service is available statewide. Service Gaps MSM-specific behavioral interv entions and MSM-targeted HIV te sting in community settings are only available in Anchorage, with the addi tion of POL outreach in the rural hub communities of Bethel and Dillingham. With the excepti on of limited private funding to one of the Anchorage CBOs, all funding for these interv entions is from the State under the CDC cooperative agreement and expires mid-2007, after which prevention for MSM in Anchorage and 35 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment the two rural hubs will be an unmet need. Prevention interventions for MSM are needed in other communities besides Anchorage. Injection Drug Users Indication of Need Users of illicit drugs need prevention intervention s that address the risk of sexual transmission of HIV. Disease investigation of an outbr eak of syphilis between mid-2004 and mid-2006, indicated an emerging overlap in the sexual networks of MSM and drug users related to production and use of methamphetamine. Drug us ers who do not identify as MSM may have a low perception of risk of sexual transmission and are not likely to avail themselves of interventions designed for gay men. Similarly, wo men sexual partners of drug users (whether or not the women inject drugs) have indicated a lo w perception of risk of sexual transmission. In interviews and focus groups with female dr ug users conducted in Anchorage between 2001 and 2002 women reported infrequent us e of condoms with casual part ners or when exchanging sex for money or goods. Women were even less lik ely to use condoms with their main male partners, even knowing of their male partner's drug use. Women also indicated a relationship between their partner's substance abuse and coercive sex. The rese arch concluded that there is a need to increase the availability of HIV te sting, condoms and educational material, and awareness-raising interventions for women dr ug users and women with drug-using partners. Input from active injection drug users in focus groups in Anchorage in 2002 indicated knowledge of the HIV and viral hepatitis transmission ri sk from sharing injection equipment. Most participants agreed that paraphernalia sale laws were not a major obstacl e to purchasing needles and syringes. However, stigma and individua l pharmacy policies and practices discourage purchase at pharmacies, leading participants to ex press interest in a syri nge exchange program. In 2006, Alaska enacted new restri ctions on the sale of pseudo-ephedrine and other precursors used in the manufacture of metham phetamine. It remains to be s een if the increased scrutiny of customers at pharmacies will be an additional de terrent to the purchase of clean syringes by illicit drug users. Prevention Services State-funded Interventions under CDC Cooperative Agreement Interior AIDS Association in Fairbanks is funde d to provide targeted street outreach and other behavioral interventions for IDU. State-funded Services The Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) wh ich includes the former Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (ADA) requires th at all individuals entering s ubstance abuse treatment have access to infectious disease screening, risk reduction education, counseling, and medical services, including diagnosis and treatment for HIV. Since 1997, notices of grant awards for funding for substance abuse treatment program s have contained the following HIV-related requirements: (a) referrals for c ounseling, testing, and treatment; (b ) staff member trained in risk reduction; and (c) HIV issues addressed in client education and treatment plans. Furthermore, there are requirements that are sp ecific to IDUs. IDUs have priori ty access to treatment, must be 36 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment admitted no later than 120 days after requesting treatment, and must receive interim services (e.g., counseling and education about HIV and TB, re ferrals for HIV and TB testing, referrals for prenatal care for IDUs who are pr egnant) while awaiting treatment. DBH funds two methadone treatment programs, one in Anchorage and one in Fairbanks (co- located with Interior AIDS Asso ciation). The STOP AIDS Proj ect within the Center for Drug Problems (CDP) in Anchorage offers individual ri sk reduction counseling to all CDP clients and provides anonymous HIV counseling and te sting to clients and the public. Non-public Funding Northern Exchange, funded by private foundatio ns and donations, provides clean syringes, condoms, and referral information about HIV prevention and drug treatment resources in Fairbanks to active IDU. The program relies heavily on secondary exchange whereby primary exchangers pick up new syringes and return used sy ringes for other IDU in their social networks. Because of stigma and confidentia lity concerns, and dispersed rather than concentrated networks, this approach has proven more acceptable to users than requiring them to interact individually with the program. In Fairbanks, Northern Exchange distributes approximately 20,000 clean syringes each year and collects about 95% of these for safe and appropriate disposal. Service Gaps IDU-specific interventions are most feasible in the larger cities -Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau. Due to stigma and confidentiality c oncerns, recruitment and retention of active drug users for interventions that invo lve group sessions is problematic. Individua l level interventions that rely on social networks may have greater su ccess in engaging active drug users both in urban settings and in areas where us ers are more widely dispersed. Harm reduction programs providing st erile syringes and opioid subst itution therapies are needed. There are methadone maintenance programs only in Anchorage and Fairbanks. There is no IDU outreach in Anchorage, or in less populous areas of the state. A privately funded syringe exchange program is operating successfully in Fa irbanks, but is needed elsewhere. There is no syringe exchange program in Anchorage. State funding under the CDC cooperative agreemen t currently supporting interventions for IDU in Fairbanks expires mid-2007, after which this will be a gap in services in Fairbanks. Heterosexual Women at Increased Risk Indication of Need Among cases of HIV diagnosed in women in the past five years in Alaska, 54% were among women whose risk factor was se xual contact with a man with HIV, a bi-sexual male or male IDU. The high incidence of STDs in women in Alaska (see Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile) is another indicator of sexual risk behavior among heterosexual women. Epidemiologic data for Alaska indicate that minority women, especially Alaska Native women, are disproportionately affected by STD and HIV. Low cost, accessible se rvices for STD diagnosis and treatment make an important contribution to HIV prevention by (a) reducing STD morbidity which is a risk 37 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment factor for HIV transmission and (b) reaching wo men for whom HIV counseling and testing may be appropriate but who might not otherwise seek out HIV testi ng and risk reduction counseling. Similarly, STD partner notification is an importa nt service for persons exposed to an STD, especially for those with asymptomatic STD inf ection who are not aware of their infection. STD partner notification also facilitates prevention counseling and HIV testing for those for whom it is appropriate. Many women whose sole risk is heterosexual contact and who test HIV-positive or who are named as a partner of an HIV-positive man, are unaware of their risk. AIDS service organizations have reported that women clients say they were unaware of their partners' risk behavior or HIV status prior to the women's own HIV diagnosis. Women are unlikely to avail themselves of HIV prevention activities specifi cally recruiting women at risk. Rather, HIV prevention efforts must be incorporated into serv ices reaching women at increased risk such as STD clinics, substance abuse treatment progr ams, correctional facilities and community residential centers (pre-releas e programs), and programs for homeless and victimized women. Needed also are HIV counseling and testing, esp ecially in non-clinic settings outreaching to homeless and substance abusing women and sex wo rkers, and provision of or referrals for HIV testing for women receiving treatment for ST Ds. Because women often do not perceive themselves or their sexual partners to be at risk for HIV, partner notification services are important for early detection of HIV and fo r providing risk reduction counseling for HIV- negative women at high risk. Routine, voluntary HIV testing of pregnant women during prenatal care, in addition to facilitating prevention of perinatal transmissi on, is a mechanism for reaching women who do not perceive themselves at risk or who have deferre d testing for other reasons. Routine prenatal HIV testing appears to be well accepted by providers and pregnant women in Alaska. Data from the Alaska Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Sy stem showed that 80% of women delivering a live-born infant in 2003 reported that a health care worker discussed blood testing for HIV during their prenatal care. A review of record s of Alaska Native women receiving prenatal care in 2005 through Southcentral Foundation, an Alaska Native health clinic in Anchorage, showed that 97% accepted HIV testing. Prevention Services State-funded Interventions under the CDC Cooperative Agreement The Four A's is funded to provide an interventi on for minority women in Anchorage and Juneau based on the Real AIDS Prevention Projec t (RAPP), a multi-strategy community-based intervention model that includes targeted soci al marketing, peer outreach, small group sessions and community mobilization. The Anchorage Ne ighborhood Health Center (ANHC) is funded to conduct multi-session health education/risk reduction groups for women in substance abuse treatment programs and single session groups in Highland Mountain co rrectional center for women. Interior AIDS Associat ion in Fairbanks conducts str eet outreach to women and multi- session health education/ risk reduction groups for women in substance abuse treatment programs and shelters. The Municipality of Anchorage Reproductive Health Clinic is funded to conduct HIV counseling and testing in communi ty venues and women-serving programs in conjunction with ANHC prevention activities. The Municipality is also funded to do STD and HIV partner services in Anchor age. The HIV/STD Program provi des HIV partner services for all persons newly reported with HIV/AIDS and their sex and needle sh aring partners. The 38 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment HIV/STD Program provides STD partner services for persons with a newly diagnosed STD in the Anchorage bowl including persons incar cerated in correcti onal facilities. HIV-specific Services Directly Funded by Federal Agencies The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortiu m (ANTHC) is funded through 2008 by CDC to conduct HIV prevention activities in Bethel and some villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. ANTHC is also funded by the federal Health Re sources and Services Administration (HRSA) for a Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) for HIV prevention and linkage to care services in the Norton Sound region. These proj ects in rural Alaska ar e a resource for women although they are not gender specific. State-funded Services Women in substance abuse treatment programs st atewide receive HIV information and access to HIV and STD testing. The Divisi on of Behavioral Health (DBH ) which includes the former Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (ADA) requi res that all individu als entering substance abuse treatment have access to infectious diseas e screening, risk reducti on education, counseling, and medical services, including diagnosis and treatment for HIV. Public Health Clinics statewide provide women' s reproductive health care including STD testing and partner follow-up and HIV c ounseling and testing on request. Service Gaps Health education/risk reduction gr oup sessions for women at increas ed risk are available only in three urban centers through gran tees receiving State funds unde r the CDC cooperative agreement through mid-2007. HIV counseling and testing for women in community settings is provided by the Municipal of Anchorage Reproductive Health Clinic. These activitie s are curren tly funded only through mid-2007. STD partner services are not availa ble in all areas of the state. HIV-specific interventions and social marketing e fforts are needed in rural Alaska. Currently funded activities are limited to a few communitie s in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Norton Sound region through federally funded special projects. Culture- and gender-specific programming and mate rials are needed for ethnic minority women in both urban and rural communities. Additional data on the prevention needs and prefer ences of women at increased risk are needed to guide future HIV prevention efforts. Heterosexual Men at Increased Risk Indication of Need Among cases of HIV diagnosed in men in the pa st five years in Alaska, 15% were among men for whom the only disclosed risk factor was sexu al contact with an HIV-positive woman, or who 39 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment came from a country with a high prevalence of heterosexually transmitted HIV. Men in minority ethnic populations, especially Al aska Natives and Blacks, are overrepresented in HIV and STD case rates in Alaska. Since some STDs are ofte n asymptomatic in men, STD partner notification is an important service for men exposed to an STD who are not aware of their infection. STD partner notification also facilitates prevention counseling and HIV testing for those for whom it is appropriate. Results of the investigation of a syphilis outbreak in Alaska between 2004 and 2006 indicate an overlap in the sexual and drug using networks of MSM and non-gay identified men who are involved in methamphetamine produc tion and use. Men who do not identify as MSM or IDU appear to have a low perception of HIV risk and are unlikely to seek out prevention interventions including HIV counseli ng and testing. Rather, HIV prevention efforts must be incorporated into servic es reaching men at increased risk such as STD clinics, substance abuse treatment programs, correct ional facilities and community residential centers (pre-release programs), and services for homeless men. State-funded Interventions under the CDC Cooperative Agreement Because heterosexual men were not identi fied as a priority population in the 2004-2006 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan, there are currently no interventions funded under the CDC Cooperative Agreement specifically targeting this segment of the population. However, funded interventions targeting other priority populations do reach heterosexual men at increased risk. Outreach conducted by the MPowerment program in bars, adult book stores, and on-line chat rooms reach men who identify as heterosexual. Municipality of Anchorage HIV counseling and testing of incarcerated persons in community release cente rs and testing in community venues to reach MSM also reach men who identify as heterosexu al. HIV and STD partner services conducted by the HIV/STD Program and by the Municipality of Anchorage are a very important mechanism for bringing HIV and STD testi ng and risk reduction counseling to men at high risk but who have low perception of risk. HIV-specific Services Directly Funded by Federal Agencies The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortiu m (ANTHC) is funded through 2008 by CDC to conduct HIV prevention activities in Bethel and some villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. ANTHC is also funded by the federal Health Re sources and Services Administration (HRSA) for a Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) for HIV prevention and linkage to care services in the Norton Sound region. These proj ects in rural Alaska are a resource for men although they are not gender specific. State-funded Services Men in substance abuse treatment programs stat ewide receive HIV information and access to HIV and STD testing. The Divisi on of Behavioral Health (DBH) that funds substance abuse treatment programs statewide requi res that all individuals entering substance abuse treatment have access to infectious dis ease screening, risk reduction ed ucation, counseling, and medical services, including diagnosis and treatment for HIV. Gaps There are currently no HIV prevention activitie s specifically targeting men who identify as heterosexual. There is a need to increase awar eness of HIV risk related to high risk sexual behavior associated with the pr oduction and use of methamphetamine in Alaska. There is a need 40 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment to increase HIV education and access to HIV test ing in services reaching men who may be at increased risk due to drug use and sexual activit y but who, because of their sexual identity, have a low perception of risk. STD partner services help identify persons with risk behaviors for whom HIV testing is appropriate, but STD partner services are not availabl e in all areas of the state. Incarcerated Persons Indication of Need According to the Alaska Department of Corr ections (DOC), the aver age daily population of incarcerated persons in Alaska in January 2006 was 4,617 males and 529 females. Alaska Natives, constituting 35% of persons in correcti onal centers and community release facilities, were over-represented in the incarcerated populat ion compared to their representation in the state's population. Blacks were slightly overr epresented, making up 10.5% of the DOC census. Persons in correctional institutions are assumed to be at increased risk for HIV because of the large proportion that is incarcerated for drug rela ted offenses. Additionally, situational male-to- male sex and sharing injection, piercing or ta ttooing equipment may occur in prison. Nationally, the Department of Justice reports that, as of the end of 2003, 2.0% of state prison inmates and 1.1% of federal prison inmates were known to be inf ected with HIV. In Alaska, as of the end of 2002, the number of inmates with HIV was 16; 0.5% of the total custody population. This HIV prevalence is lower than that of the national rate for incarcerated, but higher than the estimated HIV prevalence for the state as a whole. The Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM) study, funded by the National Institute of Justice, conducts voluntary, anonymous drug test ing and interviews with arrestees (National Institute of Justice, 2006). Data reported on study participants from DOC facilities in Anchorage in 2003 indicated that 66% of male and 52% of female arrestees tested positive for drugs. Among male arrestees, 25% tested positive fo r cocaine; 0.7% for methamphetamine; and 7.4% for heroin. Among female arrestees, 36% tested positive for cocaine; 2.1% for methamphetamine; and 5.3% for heroin. Prevention Services State-funded Interventions under CDC Cooperative Agreement. The HIV/STD Program provides HI V and STD partner services for inmates in correctional facilities in Anchorage, and coordinates HIV/STD partner el icitation and notification with Department of Corrections medical staff in othe r DOC facilities statewide. The Four A's is funded to conduct group Health Education/ Risk Reduction (HE/RR) sessions in DOC community release centers in Anchorage and Ju neau. The Anchor age Neighborhood Health Center also conducts single-s ession HE/RR groups for incarce rated women at the Highland Mountain Correctional Center in Eagle Rive r. In 2005, 594 incarcerate d men and 163 women attended these groups. The Municipality of Anc horage Reproductive Health Clinic is funded to conduct HIV counseling and testing in community release centers in An chorage in conjunction with the Four A's HE/RR sessions. Community base d organizations have identified structural impediments to conducting group HE/RR sessions in correctional centers and community release centers including cancellations due to securi ty procedures, room limitations, disinterested 41 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment participants due to mandatory attendance policies in some settings, low attendance in other settings, high drop-out rates from multi-session interventions due to release or transfer, presence of correctional officers, and rest rictions on distributing condoms for skill building exercises. State-funded Services The DOC Inmate Substance Abuse Program (ISAP) has b een eliminated except in two DOC facilities that have therapeutic communities - for sex offenders in the Wildwood Correctional Center in Kenai and in the Highland Mountain women's facil ity. Formerly, ISAP programs incorporated HIV prevention education in their programming. The demise of this programming has increased the gap in HIV prevention serv ices for inmates. Some Reformation and Habilitation Programs in DOC facilities may incl ude health topics including HIV prevention. See http://www.correct.state.ak.us/corrections/ins titutions/programs_list.htm for DOC programs. All Division of Juvenile Justic e (DJJ) facilities have youth co rrectional staff trained in the Making Proud Choices (Be Proud/Be Responsible!) curriculum. There ar e DJJ youth facilities in Anchorage, Bethel, Fairbanks, Juneau, Kena i, Ketchikan, Palmer and Nome. Group HE/RR sessions following this model are conducted on a re gular basis at the larg er DJJ facilities and, when feasible, at smaller DJJ facilities. Th e Alaska Department of Education and Early Development funds training in th is curriculum for DJJ staff and Voluntary HIV and STD testing is available upon request at all DOC and DJJ facilities. Service Gaps Interventions in adult correc tional programs conducted by CBOs in Anchorage are funded only through mid-2007. With the elimination of DOC ISAP programmi ng in July 2003, only Highland Mountain and Wildwood correctional centers have substance ab use treatment programs that can incorporate HIV prevention education. There is no systematic HIV or STD screening fo r adults remanded to correctional facilities. Except in the context of HIV and STD partner no tification activities, HI V and STD testing is dependent on an inmate initiating a re quest to see a health care provider. Youth at Increased Risk Indication of Need Data on teen pregnancy rates and STD morbid ity (see Epidemiologic Profile) indicate the prevalence of sexual risk activity among adolescents. Alaska teens aged 15-19 years consistently have disproportionately high rate s of chlamydia and gonorrhea. Data from the Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicate reduction in some risk behaviors over time, while also indicating the continuing presence of risk. YRBS data show a decrease from 1995 to 2003 in the number of high school students who report ever having sexual intercourse. There was a decrease from 48% to 40% in boys and from 46% to 40% in girls. In 2003, the percentage of high school students who report ever having ha d intercourse was lower for both boys and girls in Alaska than 42 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment the national percentages for boys (48.5%) and girls (43%). The percentage of Alaska students reporting ever having had sexual in tercourse varies by grade level from 22.4% in ninth grade to 60% of twelfth graders. Condom use among sexu ally active students ha s increased since 1995. In 2003, 62% of sexually active high school studen ts reported having us ed a condom during the last instance of sexual in tercourse. This is an increase of 7% for boys and 11% for girls. Use of alcohol or drugs before last sexual intercourse was reported by 25% of sexually active teens. This represents a slight d ecrease for boys since the 1995 survey. Among all students in 2003, 75% reported ever using alcohol, a decrease fr om 80% in 1995; 39% reported current use of alcohol, a decrease from 48% in 1995; and 27% re ported binge drinking in the 30 days prior to the survey, a decrease from 31% in 1995. Prevention Services State-funded Interventions under CDC Cooperative Agreement The Alaska Youth and Parent Foundation in Anchorage is funded to conduct an outreach program titled, Peer Outreach Worker Educatio n and Referral (POWER) Program. The POWER Program hires and trains teenagers to provi de community referrals, HIV/STD education, information, and mentoring to youth in Anchorage. In 2005, the program logged over 9,000 outreach contacts with youth on streets, in malls, recreation center s, and other sites catering to youth at increased risk. Approximately one quarter of these contact were with Alaska Native youth. The Anchorage School District is funded to provide group single sessions using the \"RARE-T\" (Reduce AIDS Risk Effectively in Teens) curric ulum. This intervention uses peer educators targeting the general secondary school population and youth at in creased risk in alternative schools. The curriculum was initially devel oped for adolescents by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In 2005, there were 5,098 part icipants in RARE-T presentations. Group HE/RR sessions using the Making Proud Choices (Be Proud/Be Responsible!) curriculum are offered by CBOs at agencies serving youth at increased risk in Anchorage and Fairbanks. State-funded Services The Alaska Department of Education and Ea rly Development receives, CDC, Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) funds for school-based health education to prevent the most serious health risk beha viors among children, adolescents and young adults. In Alaska, these funds are used to conduct the Youth Ri sk Behavior Survey and the School Health Education Profile, to purchase HIV prevention curri cula materials and support teacher training in the delivery of these curricula, and training for teachers on health education standards and assessment. The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services rece ives additional federal funds to promote an abstinence-only program , \"Postponing Sexual Involvement\" targeting middle school students. Alaska Division of Juve nile Justice facilities offer multiple session group HE/RR using the Making Proud Choices (Be Proud/Be Responsible!) curriculum and provide STD testing and treatment. State-f unded substance abuse treatment programs for youth are required to provide HIV educat ion and risk reduction counseling. Prevention Education Directly Funded by Federal Agencies Currently there are two federally funded abstinence education progr ams for youth in Alaska - the Let's Talk Program conducted by the Crisis Pregnancy Center and the Postponing Sexual Involvement curriculum for middle school students conducted by Kids Are People, Inc. 43 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment Service Gaps Street and community outreach for at-risk youth is available only in Anchorage. Funding for this program expires in mid-2007. Group health education/risk reduction sessions usi ng a curriculum with ev idence of effectiveness are available in substance abuse treatment pr ograms and youth detention facilities conducted mostly by staff, but augmented in the urba n centers by sessions conducted by CBOs funded by the state under the CDC coopera tive agreement. Funding for the CBO activities expires in mid- 2007. Comprehensive sexuality education that include s information about contraception, safer sex and disease prevention methods is needed statewide. While HIV prevention education in the context of comprehensive health education is recommen ded by the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development for kindergarten through 12 th grade, it is up to indivi dual School Districts to set district requirements for hea lth education. No school district in Alaska currently mandates HIV education. Abstinence only curricula promot e abstinence as the only acceptable form of pregnancy and STD prevention. Comprehensiv e sexuality education programs promote abstinence as well as educating students about science-based me thods of pregnancy and disease prevention. Persons in Rural Areas or in Ethni c/Language Minority Populations Indication of Need In Alaska, some minority populations are disp roportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS although the degree of disparity is less than is the case nationally for Blacks and Hispanics. Minority categories include geographic popula tions as well as those defined by race/ethnicity or language. True, there are fewer HIV/AIDS cases among persons residing in rural Alaska at time of first HIV diagnosis than among persons residing in urban centers at th e time of first HIV diagnosis. Of the 118 HIV-only cases first reported between 2001 and 2005, 22 cases (19%) were in persons residing in a rural hub community or village at the time of diagnosis, whereas, 84 cases (71%) were residing in an urban center or sub-urban community at the time of diagnosis. In absolute numbers, there are fewer HIV/AIDS cases (both cumulative and in the most recent five years of HIV-only cases) among all persons in raci al or ethnic minority groups combined than there are among Whites. However, an examina tion of rates of HIV/AIDS per 100,000 persons reveals the relative impact of these cases within categories of residence and race/ethnicity. The rate per 100,000 of HIV-only cases first diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 in persons residing in rural hubs or villages at time of diagnosis is comparable to the rate for cases in urban and sub- urban residents. Rates of HIV-only per 100,000 for cases first diagnosed in 2001 through 2005 are higher in Black men and women, Alaska Native men and women, Hispanic men, and Asian/Pacific Island men than rates for White men and women. (See Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile). While it is important to direct resources to locations and populati ons that represent the majority of cases, effort must also be directed to areas and sub-populati ons that experience a 44 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment disproportionate burden of HIV. The overall portfolio of funded in terventions for the State must include, where feasible, interventions specifically designed for these disp roportionately affected minority populations. Where interventions desi gned for a specific racial/ethnic minority (e.g. Brother to Brother or VOICE S/VOCES) are not feasible due to small population, funded interventions must attend to the diversity with in the intended particip ant group and incorporate the \"Characteristics of Effective Interventions\" (see Figure 8 in Chapter 5) with respect to cultural and language appropr iateness of materials and staffing, and must make a concerted effort to recruit participants from minor ity populations in proportion to thei r representation in the group for which the intervention is intended. For ex ample, interventions fo r MSM in a city should recruit participants to approximate the estimate d demographics of MSM; an intervention in a correctional facility s hould recruit participan ts in proportion to the demographics of the incarcerated population. Prevention Services State-funded Interventions under the CDC Cooperative Agreement The HIV/STD Program provides HI V partner services for all persons newly reported with HIV/AIDS and their sex and needle sharing partners. HIV-specific Services Directly Funded by Federal Agencies The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) is funded through mid-2009 by CDC to conduct HIV prevention activities in Bethel and some villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. ANTHC is also funded by the federal Health Re sources and Services Administration (HRSA) for a Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) for HIV prevention and linkage to care services in the Norton Sound region. The Y ukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation is funded by HRSA through mid-2007 to promote HIV testing, build capacity of providers to provide HIV testing, and to provide community education. State-funded Services HIV counseling and testing, and STD diagnosis and treatment are provided at most state-funded Public Health Nursing Centers and by public h ealth nurses at tribal health clinics under PL93- 638 contracts with the state. Publ ic health nurses also work cl osely with HIV/STD Program staff to carry out partner notification activities in rural communities. Clients in substance abuse treatment programs statewide receive HIV inform ation and access to HIV and STD testing. The Division of Behavioral Health requires that all individuals en tering substance abuse treatment have access to infectious dis ease screening, risk reduction ed ucation, counseling, and medical services, including diagnosis and treatment for HIV. Alaska Native Regional Health Corporations Involvement with HIV prevention varies by Alaska Native health corporation. In some regions, health education and behavioral health programs incorporate HI V prevention education. Some health corporations are training Community Heal th Aides/Practitioners (CHA/P) to conduct HIV testing, and the 2006 CHA/P manual includes gui delines on prevention counseling and HIV testing. Physicians and mid-level practitioners at sub-regional clinics or itinerating to village clinics may provide HIV counseling and tes ting. Currently the ANTHC Ryan White EIS Program has case managers at Alaska Native h ealth corporations in Anchorage, Bethel, 45 Chapter Three: Community Services Assessment Fairbanks, Juneau and Sitka. Case managers include prevention counseling and medication adherence counseling with their HIV-positive clients. Service Gaps HIV-specific prevention interventi ons are lacking in rural regi ons except where federally-funded special projects are being c onducted. Depending on the region receiving funding for special projects, only the regional hub and some self -selected villages are participating. Social and demographic characteristics of rural communities make implementing HIV prevention interventions for a specific behavior al risk population (e.g., MSM, IDU, heterosexual women at high risk) especially challenging. Individual-level inte rventions that target all or multiple behavioral risk populations, such as HI V counseling and testing, HIV and STD partner services, and one-on-one counseling with HIV-positive persons, are more feasible. Integration of HIV prevention information into existing programs for persons at increase risk, such as group presentations at substance abuse treatment programs, is more feasible than group sessions for members of a singl e behavioral risk population. Media-based health communication/ public information activities are needed to raise awareness about HIV, to de-stigmatize HIV testing, to direct people to prevention res ources, and to foster a compassionate response to persons with HIV. Rais ing awareness about the risk of HIV infection is a challenge in low prevalence states like Alaska . This is particularly true for rural Alaska where HIV is a lower priority than other pressing concerns. Stigma attached to having HIV and fear of disclosure are impediments to gett ing tested and, if HIV positive, seeking care. Aside from Alaska Native health corporations, there are no organizations serving racial/ethnic and linguistic minority populations that ar e currently funded to conduct HIV-specific interventions. Community groups and organizations connected to minority populations that are disproportionately impacted by HIV need support and encouragement to include HIV prevention into the services they provide, to partner with funded HIV prevention programs, and to develop the capacity to compete successf ully for HIV prevention funding. 46 Chapter Three: Community Services AssessmentChapter 4 Priority Populations 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan \"Priority setting for target populations must address populations for which HIV prevention will have the greatest impact.\" CDC 2003 Chapter Four: Priority Populations According to the CDC HIV Prevention Community Planning Guidance, \"Target populations should include populations in which the most HIV infections are occurrin g or populations with the highest HIV incidence\" and should consider \"the risk behaviors and prevention needs of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).\" The HPPG carried out an evidence-based process to determine the highest priority populations with prevention needs in Alaska. The HPPG based their decisions on data from the epidemiologic profile (see Appendix A) and the community services assessment (see Chapter 3) and thei r knowledge of Alaskan communities. Appendix B contains tables with the factor s and weighting that were used in the preliminary prioritizing based on HIV and STD data. The eight priority populations for the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan in order are: 1.HIV Positive Persons; 2.Men Who Have Sex With Men Drug Users (IDU); 4.Heterosexual women persons; 7.Youth at risk; and 8.Persons in rural areas or in ethnic/language minority populations. The following section presents the prioritized populations and summarizes the key reasons for prioritization. #1 HIV-Positive Persons HIV-positive individuals are an important populati on for both preventing further transmission of HIV infection and for preventing co-infection w ith other STDs or blood borne pathogens. Fortunately, the availability of increasingly effective therapies for HIV disease has contributed significantly to longer, h ealthier lives for persons with HIV. It is cr itical to increase the proportion of infected individuals who are aware of their HIV status and who participate in medical care, treatment, and other services s upportive of primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention refers to helping persons av oid contracting HIV infections and secondary prevention refers to reducing or alleviating a dverse consequences among persons who are living with HIV disease. A high proportion of persons who learn that they are HIV-infected adopt behaviors that are known to reduce the risk fo r transmitting HIV (CDC, 2000). However, data from national studies and HIV partner notifica tion services conducted by the State HIV/STD Program indicate the presence of risk behavior among some HIV-positive persons. 47 Chapter Four: Priority Populations #2 Men Who Have Se x With Men (MSM) The transmission category of male-to-male sexual contact (among homosexual or bisexual males) comprised 36% of all recent (2001 throu gh 2005) cases of HIV without AIDS in Alaska, and 53% of all recent cases in males. When MSM/IDU cases are included, MSM comprise 56% of recent cases in males. MSM remains the mo st prevalent risk factor for males of all races/ethnicities. The proportions of recent HIV cases in Alaska Native, Black, and Hispanic males are greater than the propor tions of these populations in HIV/AIDS cases diagnosed in males earlier in the epidemic. Between September 2004 and December 31, 2005, 26 cases of early syphilis were reported in Alaska, 22 (85 %) were in males and 13 (5 0%) were in MSM. Among these case patients and their sexual partne rs, individuals were additionally diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, herpes, human papilloma virus, and HIV. These occurrences confirm risk behavior and indi cate the need for preventi on services within the MSM community. #3 Injection Drug Users (IDU) Injection drug use is an important risk behavior for HIV infection and affects people in all areas of Alaska. Injection drug use as a single tran smission category accounte d for 18% of all recent HIV cases (21% of cases in females and 19% of cases in males, including MSM-IDU transmission). Recent cases are defined as cases of HIV infection withou t AIDS diagnosed from 2001-2005. Focus groups with IDU in Anchorage in 2002 indicated a need for syringe access, but no syringe exchange program has been initiat ed and sustained. There is an active syringe exchange program in Fairbanks. #4 Heterosexual Women at Increased Risk Heterosexual contact was the transmission cate gory for 28% of all recent HIV cases, and accounted for 54% of all recent cases in female s. (Recent cases are defined as cases of HIV infection without AIDS diagnosed from 2001-2005.) The proportions of recent HIV infections in Alaska Native and Black women are greater th an their proportionate representations in the Alaska population: Alaska Native females compri sed 28% of recent HIV cases compared to 18% of the total Alaska female population. Black females comprised 13% of recent HIV cases and 4% of the female population. Hispanic females comprised 3% of recent HIV cases and 4% of the female population. Focus group and intervie w data from Alaska Native women with a history of recent drug use indi cate sexual risk behaviors. 48 Chapter Four: Priority Populations #5 Heterosexual Men at Increased Risk Among cases of HIV diagnosed in men between 2001 and 2005 reported in Alaska, 15% were among men for whom the only disclosed risk fact or was sexual contact with an HIV-positive woman, or who came from a country with a high prevalence of heterose xually transmitted HIV. Men in minority ethnic populations, especially Alaska Natives a nd Blacks, are overrepresented in HIV and STD case rates in Alaska. Since so me STDs are often asymptomatic in men, STD partner notification is an impor tant service for men exposed to an STD who are not aware of their infection. STD partner no tification also facilitates prev ention counseling and HIV testing for those for whom it is appropriate. Results of the investigation of a syphilis outbreak in Alaska between 2004 and 2006 indicate an overlap in th e sexual and drug using networks of MSM and non-gay identified men who are involved in methamphetamine production and use. Men who do not identify as MSM or IDU appear to have a lo w perception of HIV risk and are unlikely to seek prevention interventions including HIV c ounseling and testing. Rather, HIV prevention efforts must be incorporated into services reach ing men at increased risk such as STD clinics, substance abuse treatment programs, correctiona l facilities and community residential centers (pre-release programs), and services for homeless men. #6 Incarcerated Persons Nationally, the prevalence of HIV in incarcerated populations is esti mated to be nearly five times that of the general population. A ccording to the U.S. Bureau of Justice, 2.0% of State prison inmates and 1.1% of Federal prison inmates were HIV-positive at the end of 2003. Incarceration for drug related offenses may explain much of this disproportion. Similarly, because of drug use, the prevalence of Hepatitis B and C is dispropo rtionately high among incarcerated persons. In Alaska, 0.5% of the incarcerated population in 2002 was HIV-positive. In 2002, 10% of the incarcerated population in Alaska was convicted on a charge involving a c ontrolled substance. Although not implicated in Alaska cases to date, there is a potential risk of HIV transmission in incarcerated settings through unpr otected sex, sharing drug equipm ent, and non-sterile piercing and tattooing equipment. Correctional settings provide an opportunity to deliver prevention interventions to help inmates reduce risk beha viors while incarcerated and upon release into the community, and to educate about testing for HIV, STD, and viral Hepatitis . For the purpose of the recommendations in this Plan , incarcerated persons include inmates in correctional centers, residents of Department of Corrections community residential facilitate s (half-way houses), and recently incarcerated persons on probation or parole. 49 Chapter Four: Priority Populations #7 Youth at Increased Risk The population of youth at increased risk was prio ritized on the basis of data indicating a high prevalence of sexual risk behavior s and the premise that safer beha vior patterns learned in youth may continue to serve individua ls well as they become adults. Even though HIV is uncommon in youth in Alaska, risk behavior is indicated by the occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. The 2005 rate of chlamydia in yout h aged 15-19 in Alaska was especially high in young women, at 4,145 per 100,000 females (1,085 cases), while the rate in young men was 965 per 100,000 males (269 cases). Rates in both ge nders were even higher in persons aged 20- 24. These rates compare to overall chlamydia ra tes in the Alaska population in females of 911 per 100,000 females and in males of 429 per 100, 000 males, with Alaska having among the highest chlamydia rates in the United States in 2005. Gonorrhea is much less common in Alaska, especially in very young persons, but ther e were 85 cases in females aged 15-19 years and 25 cases in males in this age group reported in 2005. Teen pregnancy rates also indi cate unprotected sex. There we re 1,499 pregnancies reported in females aged 15-19 in 2004. Pregnancy rates decr eased in youngest age gr oup (15-17 years) but increased in all other age groups in 2004 compared to 2003.] Data from the Alaska Youth Risk Behavior Su rvey (YRBS) indicate redu ction in some risk behaviors over time, while also indicating the continuing presence of risk. YRBS data show a decrease from1995 to 2003 in the number of high school students who report ever having sexual intercourse. There was a decrease from 48% to 40% in boys and from 46 % to 40% in girls. Condom use among sexually active students has increased since 1995. In 2003, 62% of sexually active high school students repo rted having used a condom duri ng the last instance of sexual intercourse. This is an increase of 7% for boys a nd 11% for girls. Use of alcohol or drugs before last sexual intercourse was reporte d by 25% of sexually active teens. This represents a slight decrease for boys since the 1995 survey. Among all students in 2003, 75% reported ever using alcohol, a decrease from 80% in 1995; 39% reported current use of alcohol, a decrease from 48% in 1995; and 27% reported binge drinking in the 30 days prior to the surv ey, a decrease from 31% in 1995. #8 Persons in Rural Areas or in E thnic/Language Minority Populations There are fewer HIV/AIDS cases among persons resi ding in rural Alaska at time of first HIV diagnosis than among persons residing in urban cent ers at the time of first HIV diagnosis. Of the 118 HIV only cases first reported between 2001 and 2005, 22 cases (19%) were in persons residing in a rural hub community or village at the time of diagnosis, whereas, 84 cases (71%) were residing in an urban center or sub-urban co mmunity at the time of diagnosis. However, the rate per 100,000 of HIV-only cases first diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 in persons residing in rural hubs or villages at time of diagnosis is comparable to the rate for urban and sub-urban cases. Rural regions have disproportionately hi gh rates of STD, especially chlamydia. In absolute numbers, there are fewer HIV/AIDS cases (both cumulative and in the most recent five years of HIV-only cases) among all persons in racial or ethnic minority groups combined 50 Chapter Four: Priority Populations than there are among Whites. However, an examination of rates of HIV/AIDS per 100,000 persons reveals the relative impact of these cases within categories of ra ce and ethnicity. Rates of HIV-only per 100,000 for cases first diagnos ed in 2001 through 2005 are higher in Black men and women, Alaska Native me n and women, Hispanic men, and Asian/Pacific Island men than rates for White men and women. Alaska Natives and Blacks are disproportionately impacted by chlamydia and gonorrhea. HIV prevention services are limite d to non-existent in ru ral areas due to small, widely dispersed populations and limited health infrastructure. In urban and rural area s alike HIV prevention information and services for non-English speakers are similarly very limited. Although currently the number of cases of HIV in Hispanics in Alas ka is small, the propor tion of cumulative cases of HIV in Hispanics (7%) is greater than the pr oportion of Hispanics in the state (4%). Given that Hispanics moving to Alaska are coming from areas of the U.S. where the HIV prevalence in Hispanics is disproportionately high and from some countries with high HIV prevalence, the need for Spanish language information and services will predictably increase. 51 Chapter Four: Priority PopulationsChapter 5 Interventions 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan \"The set of prevention interventions or activities for prioritized target populations should have the potential to prevent the greatest number of new infections.\" CDC 2003 Chapter Five: Interventions Information on Effective Interventions In selecting appropriate interven tions specific to each priority population, the HPPG considered consistency with the national strategy to iden tify previously undiagnosed HIV infection and to recommend interventions that have the potenti al to prevent the grea test number of new infections. This chapter provides information about interventions with evidence of effectiveness and describes the interventions that were considered when recommendations were identified for the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan. Research on the effectiveness of prevention interventions is available from published studies on HIV prevention projects that have been scientifically evaluated and shown to be effective in reducing risk behaviors associated with HIV transmission. In developing recommendations for the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan, the Alaska HPPG considered only those interv entions that have a sound basis in social and behavioral science theory and have demonstrated effectiveness in influencing behavior change, or are recommended by CDC as an essential co mponent of a comprehensive HIV prevention program. Core Theories of Behavior Change Behavior change theory descri bes what factors or relationshi ps influence behavior and/or environment, and provides direction on how to im pact them. Theories used in HIV prevention are drawn from several disciplines, including psychology, sociology and anthropology. A theory becomes formalized when it is carefully tested with the results repeatable in a number of different settings, and generalizable to vari ous communities (Goldman, 2001). HIV prevention interventions are informed by the following theories: Social Cognitive Theory/Social Learning Theory, Information, Motivation, Behavioral Skills , Stages of Change/Transtheoretical Model, Theory of Gender and Power, Diffusion of Innova tion Theory, Social Action Theory, Theory of Reasoned Action, Health Belief Model, and So cial Network Theory. Each prevention intervention for identified priority populations is based on behavioral and social science, outcome effectiveness, and/or has been adequate ly tested with intended target populations for cultural appropriateness, relevance, and acceptabi lity. Behavioral science research has shown that a person is more likely to lower his or her risk of HIV inf ection if he or she: 52 Chapter Five: Interventions Believes that the advantages of making a change in behavior are greater than the disadvantages; Has formed a strong intention to change; Has the skills to perform the behavior; Believes he or she can make a change; Believes that the change d behavior will more likely produce a more positive than negative emotional response; Believes that the performance of the new behavi or is consistent with his or her self-image; Perceives that there is social su pport for the behavior change; and Experiences no environmental barrier s blocking the behavior change. Characteristics of Effective Interventions The HPPG has determined that it is important to bu ild into all interventions the characteristics of effective HIV prevention interventions that have emerged from the years of prevention research and program experience. These \"C haracteristics of Effective In terventions\" are listed in Figure 8. 53 Chapter Five: Interventions Figure 8. Characteristics of Effective Interventions Interventions should: have a clearly defined target population; have clearly defined objectiv es and implementation plan; be accessible and affordable to the target popula tion, preferably taking the intervention to the intended population in the community or institutional settings; be based on sound behavioral scie nce theory, focusing on factors th at affect behavior change (skills, self-efficacy, expectation of positive response, consistency with self-image, perceived social norms, and reduction of external barriers); be based on intervention models sc ientifically evaluated with evidence of effectiveness or show evidence to support the expect ation of effectiveness; be culturally competent and relevant to the targ eted populations (i.e., consistent with norms, values, and traditions of the community); be appropriate for the developmen tal, age, and educational leve l of the intended population; be tailored to the gender and sexual orientation of the intended population; involve members of the target population in program design, implementation and evaluation; utilize personnel who reflect the cu ltural and linguistic characteristic s of the intended audience to deliver the intervention; utilize members of th e target population as peer educators; provide materials and deliver interventions in the primary language of the intended audience; focus on building and practicing skills (inf ormation alone is not enough), including harm reduction practices and communicat ion, identifying triggers and coping with risk situations; provide, directly or by referral, risk reduction materials, minimally condoms; have ample duration and intensity to promot e lasting behavior change (one time only interventions have limited effectiveness); be client-focused and tailored to client's stage of readiness, be non-judgmental, and be supportive of incremental change, recognizing that lapses are an expected part of the process of behavior change; be incorporated into services reaching persons at risk (e.g., drug and alcohol treatment, STD treatment); and have a mechanism in place for referring HIV-posi tive individuals to health care and support services. For interventions to be implemented successf ully, HIV prevention programs should: have an established relationship with the target population(s); have sufficient resources to accomplish thei r objectives; have flexibility to make mid-co urse modifications as necessary; be operated by an agency with adequate mana gement capability, and ad ministrative and board support for the interventions; provide ongoing training and deve lopment of staff and volunteers; provide support and supervision of staff and volunteers, in cluding field-based observation; develop linkages with services reaching the sa me target populations to promote referrals; and evaluate interventions to assure that they are implemented as proposed and meeting objectives. 54 Chapter Five: Interventions CDC's Diffusion of Effective Behavior al Interventions (DEBI) Project The Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interv entions (DEBI) Project began in 1999 when the Centers for Disease Control a nd Prevention (CDC) published a Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventions with Evidence of Effectiveness to respond to preventi on service providers who requested science-based interven tions that work (CDC, 2001). The DEBI Project was designed to bring science-based, community-and group-leve l HIV prevention interv entions to state and local health departments and community-based se rvice providers. The goal of the DEBI Project is to enhance the capacity to implement effective interventions at the state and local levels, to reduce the spread of HIV and STDs, and to promot e healthy behaviors. DEBIs have been proven effective through research studies that show ed positive behavioral (e.g., use of condoms; reduction in number of partners) and/or heal th outcomes (e.g., reduction in the number of new STD infections). Studies employed rigorous resear ch designs, with both intervention and control groups, so that the positive outcomes could be at tributed to the interventions. With input from the researchers, the materials n ecessary to implement the interven tions have been packaged into user-friendly kits and standardized training ar e available from CDC funded capacity building providers. More detailed information about the DEBI project and interventions, including those that will be packaged and available in th e future can be found online (AED, 2006). The following are brief summaries of the twelve sc ience-based, effective interventions for HIV prevention identified in the DEBI Project at the time this Plan was written: Healthy Relationships is a five-session, small-group inte rvention for men and women living with HIV/AIDS. It is based on Social Cognitiv e Theory and focuses on developing skills and building self-efficacy and positive expectations about new behaviors through modeling behaviors and practicing new skills. Holistic Health Rec overy Program (HHRP) is a and inje ction drug users. The primary goals of HHRP are harm reduction, health promo tion, and improved quality of life. Many Men, Many Voices (3MV) is a six- or seven-se ssion, group level STD/HIV prevention intervention for gay men of color. The intervention addresses behavioral influencing factors specific to gay men of color, including cultural/social norms, sexual relationship dynamics, and the social in fluences of racism and homophobia. Mpowerment is a community-level intervention for young men who have sex with men. The intervention uses a combination of informal and formal outreach, discussion groups, creation of safe spaces, social opportunities, and social marketing to reach a broad range of young gay men with HIV prevention, safer se x, and risk reduction messages. Popular Opinion Leader (POL) is a community-level intervention designed to identify, enlist, and train key opinion leaders to encour age safer sexual norms and behaviors within their social networks of friends and acqua intances through risk-re duction conversations. Promise (also known as Community Promise) is a community-level HIV prevention intervention that relies on peer advocates to distribute role model stories of positive behavior change to members of the target population. Th e intervention is based on Stages of Change 55 Chapter Five: Interventions and other behavioral theories, and can be im plemented with various populations including IDUs, MSM, sex workers, and partne rs of high-risk individuals. Real AIDS Prevention Project (RAPP) is a community mobilizat ion program, designed to reduce risk for HIV and unintended pregnancy among women in communities at high risk by increasing condom use. This intervention relies on peer-led activities, including: stage based encounters, role model stories and brochures , community networking, referrals, safer sex discussions and condom distri bution. RAPP is based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change. Safety Counts is a client-centered intervention for us ers of illicit drugs th at aims to reduce risk of becoming infected with or transmitting HIV and hepatitis viruses. It is a behaviorally focused, seven-session intervention, which includ es both structured a nd unstructured psycho- educational activities in gr oup and individual settings over four to six months. Sisters Informing Sisters on Topics about AIDS (SISTA) is a group-level, gender- and culturally- relevant intervention, is designed to increase condom us e with sexually active Black women. Five peer-led group sessions ar e conducted that focus on ethnic and gender pride, HIV knowledge, and skills training around sexual risk reduction behaviors and decision making. The intervention is based on Social Learning theo ry as well as the theory of Gender and Power. Street Smart is a multi-session, skills-building pr ogram to help runaway and homeless youth, ages 11 to 18, to practice safer sexual be haviors and reduce substance use. Sessions address improving youths' social skills, asse rtiveness and coping through exercises on problem solving, identifying triggers, and reduc ing harmful behaviors. Agency staff also provide individual counse ling and trips to community health providers. Together Learning Choices (TLC) (also known as Teens Linked to Care) is an effective intervention for young people, aged 13 to 29, livin g with HIV, and it is delivered in small groups. This program helps young people living w ith HIV identify ways to increase use of health care, decrease risky sexual behavior a nd drug and alcohol use, and improve quality of life. Participants set goals regarding their health sexual relationships, drug use, and daily peace related to their daily habits and social routines. It emphasizes how contextual factors influence the ability to respond effectively to stressful situations, solve problems, and act effectively to reach goals. TLC is based on Social Action Theory. VOICES/VOCES (Video Opportunities for Innovative Condom Education & Safer Sex) is a group-level, single-sessi on video-based intervention de signed to increase condom use among heterosexual Black and Hispanic men and women who visit STD clinics. Participants, grouped by gender a nd ethnicity, view an English or Spanish video on HIV risk behaviors and condom negotiation, take part in a facilitated discussi on on barriers to and negotiation of condom use, and receive samples of condoms. Procedural Guidan ce for Community-ba sed Organizations The Procedural Guidance was developed to summarize the best currently available science related to HIV prevention for co mmunity-based organizations. The Procedural Guidance 56 Chapter Five: Interventions provides an outline for each strategy under th e following subheadings: description of intervention; core elements, key characterist ics, and procedures; resource requirements; recruitment; physical setting char acteristics; necessary policies and standards; quality assurance; monitoring and evaluation; and key articles a nd resources. When se lecting HIV prevention interventions/activities the HPPG used the draft Procedural Guidance for Selected Strategies and Interventions for Community Based Organi zations Funded Under Program Announcement 04064 , which was dated December 2003. In Ap ril 2006 an updated version of the Provisional Procedural Guidance for Community Based Organizations became available and the full text can be viewed online (CDC, 2006c). As we ll, the At-a-Glance version of the Procedural Guidance was disseminated as a companion document to the full-text Procedural Guidance . Together, these two documents are meant to provide the inform ation needed to help organizations to select interventions best suited to the popu lations they intend to reach. The Procedural Guidance includes information about the aforementioned DE BI Project interventions. Below is a short summary of the activities, services, and st rategies other than DEBIs listed in the Procedural Guidance . Comprehensive Risk Counseling and Services (CRCS) for Persons at Very High Risk for HIV , formerly Prevention Case Management (PCM), aims to help clients who have multiple, complex psychosocial challenges and risk-re duction needs adopt and maintain risk-reduction behaviors. It provides inte nsive and ongoing client -centered HIV risk-reduction counseling, support, and it helps clients access other services. It helps clients initiate and maintain behavior change to prevent acquisition of HIV while a ddressing competing need s that may make HIV prevention a lower priority. CRCS for persons at very high risk informs and screens clients, helps them develop prevention strategies, delivers counseling sessions, and coordinates and follows up with other services provided to CRCS clients. Comprehensive Risk Counseling and Servi ces (CRCS) for Persons Living with HIV , formerly Prevention Case Management (PCM), aims to help clients who have multiple, complex psychosocial challenges and risk-re duction needs adopt and maintain risk-reduction behaviors. It provides intensive and ongoing client-centered HIV risk-reduction counseling, support, and it helps clients access other services. Priority is given to HIV-infected persons who are having, or are likely to have, difficulty in itiating or sustaining practi ces that reduce or prevent the transmission of HIV while addressing competi ng needs that may make HIV prevention a lower priority. It addresses the relati onship between HIV risk and othe r issues (e.g., substance abuse, mental health, social and cultura l factors, and phy sical health). HIV Counseling, Testing, and Referral (CTR) is a collection of activities designed to increase clients' knowledge of their HIV status; encourag e and support risk reducti on; and secure needed referrals for appropriate medical , prevention, and partner counse ling and referral services. HIV CTR can be anonymous (client's name is neither known nor solicited) or confidential (client provides name). Clients can refer themselves or be referred to CTR, which can be accessed through clinics, dedicated sites, outreach, and other services. Incorporating HIV Prevention into the Med ical Care of Persons Living with HIV is a set of recommendations for using outpatie nt clinics and care providers to screen for HIV transmission risk behaviors and STDs, provide brief behavioral prevention interv entions, and facilitate partner notification and counseling. The objectives are to reach a large number of HIV-infected persons, implement a safer-sex program, integrate HIV prev ention into routine medical care, and involve 57 Chapter Five: Interventions clinic staff in HIV prevention counseling. These objectives are accomplished by screening patients; providing brief behavioral risk-reductio n interventions in the office and referring clients, if needed; and facil itating notification and counseling of sex partners and drug-using partners. Partner Counseling and Referral Services (PCRS) is a public health st rategy to control and prevent the spread of HIV and other STDs. PCRS is the practice of informing current and past partners that a person who is HIV- infected has identified them as a partner at risk (sex partner or injection-drug-equipment-sharing partner). PCRS advises these informed partners to have HIV counseling and testing. For partners who are not infected with HIV, PCRS provides an opportunity for intervention to prevent them from becoming infected; for partners who are found to be infected, it provides an oppor tunity to link them to medical evaluation, treatment, and other services and an opportunity for interven tion to prevent transmission to others. Rapid HIV Testing in Nonclinical Settings is HIV testing that can be performed in selected nonclinical settings and can provi de results in 20 minutes, takes advantage of the benefits of outreach testing, increases the like lihood that tested persons recei ve their results, and requires confirmation if test results ar e positive. Rapid HIV Testing in nonclinical settings aims to increase knowledge of HIV stat us among many groups. By bringi ng testing into the community and providing test results quickl y, rapid HIV testing can be used to reach groups in which HIV infection has been under diagnosed. Testing progra ms in nonclinical settings are more likely to reach members of some racial and ethnic minorit ies and persons at increased risk for HIV. Routine HIV Testing of Inmates in Correctional Facilities is a service in which inmates are informed of the availability of free voluntary rapid HIV counseling and te sting. The goal is to identify HIV infection among inma tes who are unaware of their st atus or who have previous negative test results. Prevention and care services can then be provided to those who need them, during incarceration and after rel ease. For those incarcerated for fewer than 30 days, routinely providing rapid HIV testing will increase the proporti on tested and notified of their results before release. Universal HIV Testing of Pregnant Women is an intervention to re duce perinatal transmission of HIV in the United States. It identifies pregna nt women for whom antiretroviral and obstetric interventions can reduce the ri sk of having a HIV-infected ba by. There are two approaches to offering HIV testing to pregnant women: 1) opt-in, in which pr egnant women are given pretest counseling and must specifically co nsent, usually in writing, to an HIV test, and 2) opt-out, in which pregnant women are notified that a HIV test will be included in the standard battery of prenatal tests and that they may decline testing. Compendium of HIV Prevention Interven tions with Evidence of Effectiveness The Compendium of HIV Prevention Interventi ons with Evidence of Effectiveness was compiled by CDC to include evaluated projects with de monstrated effectiveness in November 1999 and was revised in August 2001. All in terventions selected for this Compendium came from behavioral or social studies that had both intervention and control/comparison groups and positive results for behavioral or health outcomes. CDC required designs with control/comparison groups so that successful results could be attr ibuted to the interventions. To 58 Chapter Five: Interventions meet the ongoing need for current information about what works in HIV prevention, this Compendium is updated periodically. The Compendium provides state-of-the-science information about interventions wi th evidence of reducing sex- and/ or drug-related risks, and the rate of HIV/STD infections. The full text of the Compendium can be found online (CDC, 2001). The following are the prevention interv entions listed in the Compendium: ACDP Research Group, 1999, AIDS Co mmunity Demonstration Projects \u00b9 Des Jarlais, et al., 1992, AIDS /Drug Injection Prevention El-Bassel & Schilling, 1992, Skills Building Magura, et al., 1994, Intensive AIDS Education in Jail \u00b9 McCusker, et al., 1992, Informational and Enhanced AIDS Education ACDP Research Group, 1999, AIDS Co mmunity Demonstration Projects \u00b9 Cohen, et al., 1991, Condom Skills Education Cohen, et al., 1992, Group Discussion Condom Promotion DiClemente & Wingood, 1995, Social Skills Training Hobfoll, et al., 1994, Reducing AIDS Risk Activities Kamb, et al., 1998, Project RESPECT Kelly, et al., 1994, Cognitive-Behavioral Skills Training Group Lauby, et al., 2000, Women and Infant s Demonstration Projects (WIDP) O'Donnell, et al., 1998, Video Opportuni ties for Innovative Condom Education and Safer Sex (VOICES/VOCES) Wenger, et al., 1991, HIV Education, Testing, and Counseling ACDP Research Group, 1999, AIDS Co mmunity Demonstration Projects \u00b9 Kegeles, et al., 1996, Mpowerment Project Kelly, et al., 1989, Behavioral Se lf-Management and Assertion Skills Kelly, et al., 1991, Popular Opinion Leader (POL) Valdiserri, et al., 1989, Small Group Lecture Plus Skills Training ACDP Research Group, 1999, AIDS Co mmunity Demonstration Projects \u00b9 Jemmott, et al., 1992, Be Proud! Be Responsible! Kirby, et al., 1991, Reducing the Risk Magura, et al., 1994, Intensive AIDS Education in Jail \u00b9 Main, et al., 1994, Get Real about AIDS 1992 Rotheram-Borus, et al., 1997, StreetSmart Stanton, et al., 1996, Focus on Kids St. Lawrence, et al., 1995, Becoming a Responsible Teen (BART) 59 Chapter Five: Interventions There are two interventions, Street and Community Outreach and Be Proud! Be Responsible/Making Proud Choices !, which are listed in the Compendium that are not DEBIs, but that have been successfully implemented in Alaska in prior years. Street and Community Outreach has model programs or studies on effectiveness in the Compendium . The HPPG considered Street and Comm unity Outreach as an intervention type that is grounded in behavior chan ge theory, scientifically evaluate d, and shown to be effective. Street and Community Outreach aims to reduc e HIV infection through decreasing unsafe sexual behaviors, increasing condom use, and delaying sexual activity. Street and Community Outreach also aims to reduce sharing of injection equi pment, increase clean syringe access and bleach cleaning, and increase HIV counsel ing and testing. Paid or vol unteer peer outreach workers, who are cultural and linguistic representatives of the target population, provide a sustained and regular presence in the commun ity. Efforts are focused on specific areas of a community frequented by persons who engage in risk beha vior. Outreach workers provide risk reduction information and supplies, such as condoms and l ubricant, injection harm reduction equipment as applicable, and information on HIV Health E ducation and Risk Reduction (HE/RR) and HIV Counseling and Testing (CT) res ources. Outreach workers facilita te personal risk perception and risk assessment and provide skills training to outreach contacts. Messages of peer and community support for safer behaviors, and specif ic referrals to more intensive risk reduction resources are provided as appropriate. Making Proud Choices! is an adaptation and extension of the original Be Proud! Be Responsible! curriculum in that it integrates STD, HI V and pregnancy prevention. It is an eight- module curriculum that provides young adolescent s with the knowledge, confidence, and skills necessary to reduce their risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV, and pregnancy by using condoms if they choose to have sex. The goal of Making Proud Choi ces! is to empower young adolescents to change their behavior by dr awing upon three theories: the Social Cognitive Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action and its extension, the Theory of Planned Behavior. 60 Chapter Five: Interventions Additional HIV Prevention Interventions/Activities Additional HIV prevention intervention/activities were considered by the HPPG that were not listed in the DEBI Project, Procedural Guidance , or the Compendium . Each of these intervention types has examples of projects employing the interv ention that were grounded in behavior change theory and had be en scientifically evaluated and s hown to be effective, or they are interventions recommended by CDC as an important component of comprehensive HIV prevention services. Targeted Health Communication /Public Information (HC/PI) is an intervention designed for any specified target population. There are four prev ention goals: 1) encourage persons at risk to seek HIV counseling and testing; 2) raise awareness and disp el myths about HIV/AIDS; 3) influence community norms in support of safer be havior; and 4) support individual efforts for personal risk reduction. Culturally, linguistically , and community appropriate messages are used to raise awareness, educate about risk reduc tion, and to influence community norms. Messages are dispersed through the use of broadcast (television, radio), el ectronic (websites, email, list serves), print media, and hotlines that are acces sed by the specific target population. A study by the Rand Corporation applied a mathematical mode l to the cost of HIV prevention interventions and national data on HIV risk-group size and HI V prevalence. The optimal allocation of HIV prevention activities involved a combination of intensive interventions for high-prevalence populations and inexpensive large-scale interv entions for lower-prevalence populations (Cohen, et al, 2005). Inexpensive large-scale interventi ons, such as HC/PI coul d appropriately address Alaska's lower-prevalence populations. Syringe Exchange is an intervention designed for Injection Drug Users (IDU) with the following prevention goals: reduce sharing of injection equipment; reduce unsafe sexual behaviors, and increase HIV counseling and testing. The HP PG recognizes that syringe exchange is an intervention that cannot be s upported with federal funds, but considers it as an intervention with evidence of eff ectiveness. This intervention involves paid or volunteer peer outreach workers who are cultural and linguistic representatives of the target population and who have a sustained and regular presence in the community. Volunteers provide clean new syringes, needles, and other sterile injection drug equipmen t in exchange for used needles, as well as, referrals to drug treatment, methadone maintenan ce programs, and other services to help users reduce their drug use. Volunteers may also provide risk reducti on information and supplies, such as condoms, lubricant, and information on HIV counseling and testing fa cilitates. Syringe exchange addresses two components of theoreti cal factors affecting HIV risk behavior - perceived social norms for safer behavior and reduced environmental barriers. Research on the effectiveness of syringe exchange has been su mmarized and published by the National Research Council, Institute of Medicine (1995). Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Testing, T reatment, and Partner Notification Services is an intervention designed to test and treat STDs as an effective approach to reducing the likelihood of HIV transmission, if an exposure we re to occur (Fleming and Wasserheit, 1999). Consistent efforts to locate, counsel, test, and treat exposed sexual part ners are critical to reducing STD transmission, especially since STD sy mptoms may be absent or ignored. Infection with STD indicates unprotected se xual intercourse, which is al so a risk behavior for HIV infection. Studies have shown that persons infect ed with STD are more likely to transmit HIV, if 61 Chapter Five: Interventions infected, and more susc eptible to HIV infection, if exposed and uninfected. HIV infection has been most closely associated in the U.S. with syphilis and gonorrhea infections in heterosexual populations in the Southeast Un ited States and with syphi lis and gonorrhea among men who have sex with men in a number of urban setti ngs. An association between HIV and chlamydia infection is biologically plausible but has not been well explored. Compared to other U.S. states, Alaska has a relatively low prevalence of HIV infection, a gonorrhea rate slightly below the average rate fo r the U.S. as a whole, and a high rate of chlamydia infection (this may be due in part to increased public hea lth efforts to detect infections). Infectious syphilis, once rare in Al aska, re-emerged in recent years. An outbreak that began late in 2004 had resulted in 26 inf ectious syphilis cases reported through December, 2005. New cases continued to be reported in 2006. A large proporti on of these cases occurred in MSM, and a significant proportion of those infected were also HIV positive. Some cases reported in 2005and 2006 were also associated with methamphetamine use. With the exception of syphilis, concurrent (co -) infection with two STDs or with HIV and another reportable STD are uncommon in Alaska . This indicates that individuals' sexual networks differ and that certain infections are more common in some networks than others. Since having a STD indicates risk behavior (unprotected sex, multiple partners), persons with STDs and their partners are candidates for preven tion counseling and potentia lly for HIV testing. Because some STDs are so common, because ST D infection facilitates HIV transmission, and because the number of persons living with HIV increases each year (since infection is lifelong), activities to reduce STDs infec tion rates (especially gonorrhea a nd syphilis since they tend to occur in individuals with the highe st risk sexual networks) have a role in overall efforts to reduce HIV transmission. HIV Counseling and Testing through Social Networks is a programmatic, peer-driven, recruitment strategy to reach the highest risk pe rsons who may be infected but unaware of their status. This technique is accomplished by enlistin g newly and previously diagnosed HIV-positive and high-risk-negative recruiters on an ongoing ba sis and providing HIV CTR to people in their networks. The use of social networks is a recr uitment strategy whereby public health services are disseminated through the community by taking advantage of the social networks of persons who are members of the community. The strategy is based on the concept that individuals are linked together to form large social networks, an d that infectious diseas es often spread through these networks. The primary goal of a social network strategy is to identify persons with undiagnosed HIV infection within various networks and link them to medical care and prevention services. More information can be found in the Interim Guide for HIV Counseling, Testing, and Referral Programs titled, Social Networks Testing: A Community-Based Strategy for Identifying Persons with Undiagnosed HIV Infection (CDC 2006d). It is appropriate and recommended that in adapting any of thes e interventions for implementation in Alaska, programs tailor the model, curriculum and materials to the intended target population and location. Howe ver, adaptations must retain the essential components of the model and fidelity to the underlying theory. Selecting Interventions 62 Chapter Five: Interventions For recommendation in the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan , the Alaska HPPG reviewed the information on the interventions that have a th eoretical basis and evidence of effectiveness or are strongly recommended by CDC. In addi tion, the HIV/STD Program staff provided an assessment of the advantages and drawbacks of the evidence based DEBIs and other CDC- recommended interventions. This assessment was based on the experience of the health department and local community based organiza tions with implementing selected DEBIs in Alaska over the past three to five years. The HIV/STD Program iden tified advantages and drawbacks of the DEBIs in general, and then reviewed for the HPPG the challenges for implementing each of the specific DEBIs in Alaska. The drawbacks are by no means unique to Alaska, but many are related to ch aracteristics of Alaska - rela tively small population, relatively low HIV prevalence and limited resources for HI V prevention. The following are the general advantages and drawbacks of DEBI s for implementation in Alaska. Advantages and Drawbacks of DEBIs Advantages Interventions are based on behavior change theory; Interventions have evidence of effectiveness from rigorous evaluation research; Essential core elements are clearly identified; Packaged materials and curri culum are available; and National, standardized training for facilitators has been developed. Drawbacks The drawbacks or limitations of the DEBIs ha ve to do with two major issues: (1) the applicability/feasibility of implem enting them in Alaska and with the current level of funding; and (2) the availability of training and curricula. 1. Applicability/Feasibility Each DEBI was developed for a specific targ et population defined by risk factor and/or demographics; adapting a DEBI for a different population takes considerable resources and expertise. DEBIs were developed as research projects w ith far greater resources for implementation than are available to CBOs. The research pr ojects had more staff, more highly trained staff, higher pay for staff, a nd higher incentives for participan ts than can be replicated locally. DEBIs were developed and tested in cities with specific community features (for example, gay bars, housing projects, concen trated ethnic neighborhoods ) and with larger populations and higher HIV prev alence than Alaska. Recruiting the intended population and achieving fidelity to the model are challe nging where the conditions of the original model are not present. 63 Chapter Five: Interventions Many DEBIs involve multi-session groups. It is more difficult to recruit and retain participants for multi-session groups than for briefer, more spontaneous and less intensive interventions such as outreach. The time lag between research and diffusion of a model intervention results in models and materials being out of date by the time they are ready for implementation. Updating interventions takes resources and expertise. 2. Training and Materials The national trainings and distribution of packaged materials have lagged behind the promotion of the DEBI models. National trainings are conducted in the conti guous United States. Sending staff from Alaska is costly. CBO staff turnover adds to the cost of training a nd creates interruptions in implementation of a DEBI. Slots in the national trainings have been limited and health de partments and their grantees have been a lower priority th an CBOs directly funded by CDC. When implementing a DEBI that relies heav ily on volunteers, a CBO has to have the resources to support frequent training in the intervention due to volunteer turnover. Evaluation measures used for the original re search projects are too comprehensive for CBO use; brief evaluation measures have not yet been developed for the DEBIs. Additional Consider ations for Selecting Interventions Based on the local experience with impleme nting DEBIs and other CDC-recommended interventions in Alaska, the HIV/STD Progr am provided the following suggestions for developing recommendations for interventions. Recommend specific intervention models: Th e previous Plan recommended intervention types such as group health education/risk re duction, rather than naming specific DEBI models. After three to five years of local experience with implementing DEBIs and with the increased availability of DEBI materials, there is better information on which to make specific recommendations. Recommend a mix of interventions that maximi ze the impact of available (and declining) resources: A recent Rand Corporation study on cost-effective allocation of HIV prevention funds (Cohen 2005) recommended a co mbination of intensive, individually focused interventions for HIV-positive pers ons and partners (partner notification services); intensive efforts for the high er prevalence populatio ns of MSM and IDU (community mobilization and needle exchange); and inexpensive larger scale interventions such as condom distribu tion and mass media campaigns for lower- prevalence populations. 64 Chapter Five: Interventions Emphasize interventions that reach individuals most likely to have HIV or be at highest risk, with targeted one -on-one interventions. Recommend fewer group HE/RR interventions for persons not known to be HIV-positive. Experience has shown that recruitment and retention of groups of persons in the intended pr iority population is difficult and that more generalized groups, such as women in substance abuse treatment, often include many persons not necessarily at high risk. Recommend a smaller portfolio of interven tions. Whereas the HIV/STD Program has been an enthusiastic \"early adopter\" of DEBI s because of the advantages of interventions with well-researched evidence of effectiveness, three to fi ve years of experience with DEBIs has provided a better understanding of the challenges of implementing these interventions in a low HIV prevalence state with relatively small and dispersed priority populations. With fewer intervention mode ls to support, the HIV/STD Program can better meet the training needs for grantees and thereby reduce CBOs' costs and reduce program interruptions due to staff turnover, as well as provide quality assurance and technical assistance for grantees. Include language in the recommendations that leaves the door open for other interventions with evidence of effectiveness be side those specified so as to accommodate: o an applicant for state prevention fundi ng that presents a good justification and work plan for doing an evidence-based in tervention not specified in the Plan; o other DEBIs or CDC-recommended interven tions that come out during the three years covered by the Plan; and o organizations seeking funding from other sources that require reference to the HIV prevention plan. 65 Chapter Five: InterventionsChapter 6 Recommendations 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan Chapter Six: Recommendations HIV Prevention Goals This chapter contains recommendations for a mix of prevention activities and interventions that are science-based and appropriate for each prio ritized target populati on. The recommendations support the following HIV prevention goals: 1. Increase the number of HIV-infected persons who know their HIV status. Strategies for doing so include: offering HIV testing in conj unction with partner notification services to persons potentially exposed to HIV; providing HI V testing services in sites reaching persons at increased risk; encouraging HIV testing, when indicated, as part of routine medical care; and supporting use of testing technologies accepta ble to patients and appropriate to settings. 2. Reduce HIV transmission to prevent new infections. Strategies for doing so include early case identification throu gh providing notification, testing, an d prevention counseling for sex and needle-sharing partners of infected persons; facilitating di agnoses and treatment of STDs in persons with HIV infection; providing target ed behavior change interventions for persons with HIV infection and their partners; facilita ting infected persons' pa rticipation in medical care and supportive services; and encouraging routine incorporation of prevention into medical care for HIV-positive persons. 3. Reduce HIV risk behavior and co-factors by providing targeted behavior change interventions for HIV-negative persons a nd persons of unknown HIV status who have behavioral risk factors for HIV infection, promoting community norms for adopting safer behaviors, and providing STD partner services. 4. Reduce the number of HIV-positive persons that progress to AIDS by linking persons with HIV infection to medi cal care and support services. HIV Prevention Recommendations The Alaska HIV Prevention Pla nning Group recommends that the full range of comprehensive HIV prevention program activities set forth in CDC guidelines be conducted in Alaska. Recommended prevention interventions are, to th e greatest extent possible, science-based with evidence of effectiveness for the specified priority populations. Recommendations for interventions and suppor ting activities are or ganized by priority population. These are followed by overall re commendations for capacity building, needs assessment, evaluation, and other health depart ment activities necessary for a comprehensive HIV prevention program. 66 Chapter Six: Recommendations Interventions Specific to Priority Populations Interventions recommended for each priority pop ulation and the corresponding prevention goals are listed below.

Like HIV, hepatitis viruses are transmitted through sexual activity and sharing of drug injection equi pment or other implements contaminated with blood. Additionally, as with HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) can be transmitted perinatally from a woman who is a hepatitis B carrier. Among current and former injection drug users (IDU) living with HIV in the U.S., up to 90% are co-infected w ith hepatitis C (HCV). It is estimated that between 50 to 80% of IDUs become infected w ith HVB and HCV within five years of beginning to inject. Men who have sex with men (MSM) ar e disproportionately a ffected by both hepatitis A and B. About 15% of all new HBV infections in the U.S. are among MSM. Approximately 15% of persons with chronic HBV infection and 39% of persons with chronic hepatitis C virus infection have a history of in carceration. Vaccines are availabl e to prevent infection with Hepatitis A and B. Medical treatments can he lp many persons with HCV. CDC recommends the following prevention and testing measures (CDC 2006e): Injection Drug Users (IDU) Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations Hepatitis C virus counseli ng, testing and referral Services for HCV-positive persons Substance abuse treatment Heterosexuals at Increased Risk Hepatitis B vaccination Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations HIV-Positive Persons Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations Hepatitis C virus counseling, te sting and referral for IDU Incarcerated Persons Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations Hepatitis C virus counseli ng, testing and referral Substance abuse treatment The Alaska HIV Prevention Pl anning Group recommends that HIV interventions include information about the risks of viral hepatitis, the benefits of vaccination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B and, for persons with IDU risk factor s, referrals for HCV counseling and testing. The Planning Group further recommends that persons with hepatitis C receive HIV counseling and testing, and any necessary service referrals. 74 Chapter Six: Recommendations Recommendations for Capacity Building Capacity building refers to a planned pro cess by which individuals , organizations, and communities are assisted to develop skills and abilities to enhance and sustain HIV prevention efforts. Capacity building ac tivities may include, but are no t limited to, training, technical assistance, quality assurance guidance, recomme ndations for materials and intervention models and curricula, assistance in grant writing, a nd support for organizationa l and infrastructure development. Capacity building may be pr ovided by the health department, national HIV prevention capacity building providers, or by public or private local , state or national organizations with expertise in the areas of interest. The HIV Prevention Planning Group recommends: For community-based organizations funded fo r HIV prevention and other HIV prevention providers, and for organizations with ties to priority populati ons, capacity building activities in the areas of design, implementation, and evaluation of HIV prevention interventions, grant writing, a nd organizational development. For agencies and institutions se rving priority populations (suc h as correctional facilities, substance abuse treatment programs, social service agencies, mental health services, women's shelters, local government agencies , Alaska Native tribal organizations, and programs serving youth), capacity building activiti es to foster and support the incorporation of HIV prevention into their programs and services. For public health and private sector health care providers, training in HIV counseling for use of rapid HIV testing t echnologies, and promotion of offering HIV testing, when indicated, in the contex t of clinical care. For the Alaska HIV Prevention Planning Group, capacity building activities to support the prevention planning process and the members' in terface with their respective communities. To support the HPPG in making recommendations for appropriate inte rventions, the HPPG requires information on emerging research on effective interventions and on adapting proven interventions to be cu lturally appropriate for the di verse populations of Alaska. For the HIV/STD Program staff, training opportuniti es to assure that the health department has the capacity to manage and support all components of a comprehensive HIV prevention program. Recommendations for Needs Assessment To support the ongoing work of assessing HIV prev ention needs and preferences of populations at risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV, the HIV Prevention Planning Group requires the input of the following populations during the period of 2007 to 2009: HIV-positive persons; Men who have sex with men; and Heterosexual women at increased risk. 75 Chapter Six: Recommendations Additional needs for input from affected commun ities and populations may emerge within the time period covered by the Plan. Recommendations for Evaluation The HPPG supports the use of HIV Prevention funds to evaluate the community planning process and the HIV prevention activities carried out by the HIV/STD Program and its grantees and contractors. Continuation is re commended for the activities below. The HPPG participates in an annual self-evaluation to assess its achievement of the core objectives of community planning. The HPPG annually examines th e state health department's application to CDC to assess its correspondence with the Comprehensive Plan. Annually the health department presents to the HPPG data on the allocation of HIV prevention resources so that the HPPG can assess the corresponden ce between this resour ce allocation and the Comprehensive Plan. The HIV/STD Program requires process evaluati on data on all funded interventions that are carried out by grantees, contract ors, or Program staff. Process data provide information on the reach and retention of th e intervention and the demographic ch aracteristics of participants. The HIV/STD Program uses these data to monito r the implementation of funded activities and presents summary data to the HPPG in support of the planning process. Grantee organizations use these data to monitor their programs' progre ss toward their objectives and to inform their program planning. Other Health Department Activities Ca rried Out Under the CDC Cooperative Agreement The HPPG endorses the use of HIV prevention funds under the CDC cooperative agreement to assure that the Alaska HIV/STD Programs retains the staff and infrastructure to implement all components of a comprehensive HIV prevention progr am. In addition to the health department's responsibilities noted in previous sections of the Plan with re spect to community planning, HIV prevention activities, capacity bu ilding and evaluation, the HIV/STD Program must have the ability to: prepare grant applications and repor ts; manage grants to CBOs and other agencies; implement quality assurance systems; respond to the surveillance data needs of the HPPG, prevention programs, and providers; oversee a ma terial review panel for ongoing review of educational materials; collaborate and coordina te with other state and community agencies, health department programs, and Alaska Nativ e tribal organizations that serve priority populations as defined in the Pl an; and provide guidan ce on policy issues related to HIV/AIDS for the State of Alaska. 76 Chapter Six: RecommendationsChapter 7 Overview of the Community Planning Process 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan Chapter Seven: Overview of th e Community Planning Process HIV Prevention Community Planning Since January 1994, state, territo rial, and local health depart ments receiving HIV prevention funds through the CDC have conducted comm unity planning activities to develop comprehensive HIV prevention plans. In Alas ka, a statewide Alaska HIV Prevention Planning Group (HPPG) was organized in 1994 to guide the planning process. It is the joint responsibility of the HPPG members and the health depart ment to implement HIV prevention community planning. This collaborative planning process aims to improve the effectiveness of HIV prevention programs through the participation of individuals who are aff ected by HIV/AIDS and who are knowledgeable about HIV prevention and Al aska communities. Persons who reflect the perspective of the populations most affected by HIV, as well as epidemiologists, social scientists, providers, and State HIV/STD Prog ram staff, work together to develop a statewide prevention plan that best represents the needs of populations at risk for, or inf ected with, HIV/AIDS. Goals of HIV Prevention Community Planning The CDC has defined three major goals to provide an overall dire ction HIV prevention community planning: Goal One \u2014 Community planning supports broa d-based community participation in HIV prevention planning. Goal Two \u2014 Community planning id entifies priority HIV prevention needs (a set of priority target populations and interventions fo r each identified target population) in each jurisdiction. Goal Three \u2014 Community planni ng ensures that HIV prevention resources target priority populations and interventions set forth in the comprehensive HIV prevention plan. Guiding Principles for HIV Prevention Community Planning To ensure that the HIV prevention community pla nning process is carried out in a participatory manner, the CDC has specified the following Guid ing Principles of HI V Prevention Community Planning: 1. The health department and community pl anning group must work collaboratively to develop a comprehensive HIV prevention plan for the jurisdiction. 2. The community planning process must reflec t an open, candid, and participatory process, in which differences in cultural and ethni c background, perspective, and experience are essential and valued. 77 Chapter Seven: Overview of the Community Planning Process 3. The community planning process must involve representatives of populations at greatest risk for HIV infection and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). 4. The fundamental tenets of co mmunity planning are parity, inclusion, and representation. Parity is the condition whereby all members part icipate equally in the planning process and have equal voice in voting and other decision-making activities. Inclusion is the assurance that th e views, perspectives, a nd needs of all affected communities are included and involved in a meaningful manner in the community planning process. Representation means that members reflect the perspective of a specific community and that they understand that community's values , norms, and behaviors. Representatives must also be able to participate as gr oup members in objectively weighing the overall priority prevention needs of the State. 5. An inclusive community planning process incl udes representatives of varying races and ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, ages , and other characterist ics such as varying educational backgrounds, prof essions, and expertise. 6. The community planning process must ac tively encourage and seek out community participation. 7. Nominations for membership should be solicited through an open process and candidates' selection should be based on criteria established by the health department and the community planning group. 8. An evidence-based process for setting pr iorities among target populations should be based on the epidemiologic profile and the community services assessment. 9. Priority setting for target populations must address populatio ns for which HIV prevention will have the greatest impact. 10. The set of prevention interven tions/activities for prioritize d target populations should have the potential to prevent the greatest number of new infections. Current Alaska HIV Prev ention Group Members Members of the Alaska HPPG are volunteers, selected for their knowledge and personal experience related to HIV and risk behaviors, as well as their technical expertise in program planning, evaluation, epidemiology, behavioral scien ce, and other fields re lated to prevention. Members are diverse in race/ethnicity, serost atus, socioeconomic leve l, sexual orientation, 78 Chapter Seven: Overview of the Community Planning Process education, and areas of expe rtise. The HPPG's Membership Workgroup reviews HPPG composition and membership needs, and presents criteria to the H PPG for new members' characteristics to address those needs. Recruitmen t activities identify the criteria being sought in new members and HPPG member nominations are solicited from consumers and HIV prevention providers throughout the state re presenting both governmental a nd non-governmental agencies. The State Epidemiologist, in the Division of Pub lic Health, Department of Health and Social Services, appoints members. A charter that describe s the purpose, duties, liaisons, memb ership, records, and governance of meetings, subcommittees, and working teams guide s the HPPG. Meetings are generally held quarterly and additional meetings and/or teleconferences for the full HPPG may be scheduled if deemed necessary by the co-chairs. Three HPPG members, two of whom are community members and one of whom represents the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, share the Chair of the Alaska HPPG. Facilitation of meetings is rotated among the three co- chairs. At the time of publication of the 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan , the HPPG was composed of the following members: Scott Bailey, Anchorage Hugh Brown, III, Community Co-chair, Anchorage Victor Carlson, Anchorage Sarah Carter, Anchorage Wendy Craytor, Health Department Co-chair, Anchorage Gloria Eldridge, Anchorage Pearlene Hernandez, Anchorage Michael Jones, Community Co-chair, Anchorage Sigvold Juliussen, Anchorage Elizabeth Lee, Bethel Cheryl Fairbanks Golga Sakar, Anchorage Bay Barbara Wilson, Fairbanks Margaret Wilson, Fairbanks Efforts are made to organize a di verse planning group that is guide d by the fundamental tenets of HIV prevention community planning: pari ty, inclusion and representation. Community Input Process In addition to the HPPG's membership, the prevention planning process includes multiple activities to seek input from popul ations at increased risk, servi ce providers to these populations, experts in related fields, and in terested others. HPPG meetings are open to the public and each full meeting includes a public comment period. Meetings are posted on the State's website and advertised through listserve announ cements. There are liaisons to the HPPG from three state 79 Chapter Seven: Overview of the Community Planning Process agencies with important roles in HIV prevention in Alaska and are regularly invited to attend meetings. Liaisons to the HPPG from 2004 to 2006 were: Terri Campbell and Todd Brocious, Departme nt of Education and Early Development Viki Wells, Division of Behavi oral Health, Department of Health and Social Services Sara Williams, Department of Corrections Other specific individuals and agency representatives are specially invited to participate in HPPG meetings where their expertise or interest is particularly relevant . Prevention provider teleconference participants, whic h include over 50 providers statew ide, and other individuals or agencies known to be interested and involved in HIV prevention are re gularly advised of the HPPG's meeting dates. The Alaska HPPG and the Alaska Ryan White CARE Consortia and lead agencies share information and mutual participation in their respective activities thr ough several mechanisms. Since the Alaska HIV/STD Program supports bo th groups, communication about prevention and care activities is easily facilitated by HIV/ STD Program staff. Generally there is some overlapping membership between the HPPG and one or more HIV CARE Consortia. Data from Ryan White CARE Act activities are shared with the HPPG and included in the needs assessment process. Reciprocally, the comp rehensive Plan is shared with the CARE Consortium. Prevention and care providers and H PPG members receive epidemiologic data in Section of Epidemiology Reports and Recommendations and Epidemiology Bulletins . Since 2001, there has been an increase in the interac tion between the HPPG an d the Ryan White CARE services with the implementation of more prevention activities for HIV-positive persons. Beginning in 2000, HPPG information was made avai lable on the Internet through the Section of Epidemiology web site at http://www.epi.h ss.state.ak.us/hivstd/hppg. Approved meeting minutes, upcoming meeting dates and agendas, a li st of current HPPG members and their areas of residence, and applications for HPPG membership are post ed on the website. The current Alaska HIV Prevention Plan is posted on the website and pu blic comment is welcome. 80 Chapter Seven: Overview of the Community Planning ProcessAppendix A Epidemiologic Pro le 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention Plan Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile OVERVIEW Through December 31, 2005, 1,048 cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in Alaska, 318 with HIV infection without AIDS and 730 with AIDS. Of the 1,048 cases, 846 cases (81%) were in males and 202 cases (19%) were in females. On average, 40 HIV/AIDS cases were newly di agnosed per year from 2001-2005, a decline from the average of 52 cases per year in the period from 1996-2000. Beginning in 1996, HIV-related deaths declined significantly in Alaska and in th e U.S., primarily due to a dvances in medical care and treatment. The decline in deaths and a relative ly constant rate of new infections resulted in a steady increase in the number of persons in th e population living with HI V. Needs for medical care, supportive services, and ongoing prevention services will cont inue to grow as persons with HIV live longer, healthier lives. Since the earliest identified cas es in Alaska, as occurred nati onally, the number and proportion of HIV/AIDS cases in males exceeded those in female s. Over time, the proportion of cases in males declined and the proportion of cases in females increased. In the most recent five-year period (2001-2005), an average of 29 HIV/AI DS cases (73% of total cases) per year in Alaska were in males compared to an average of 11 HIV/AIDS cases (27% of total cases) pe r year in females. Seventy-one percent of all HIV cases were first diagnosed in persons between the ages of 25 and 44 years. The largest numbers of cases (214; 20% of the total) were in persons aged 30-34 years at first HIV diagnosis. A greater proportion of female than male cases occurred in persons in a younger age group at the time of first HIV diagnosis (19% of females were aged 15-24 years, and 11% of males). Fortunately, unlike some other areas of the U.S ., HIV infection was uncommon in adolescents in Alaska, although behaviors placing individuals at increased risk of HIV exposure were relatively common in this population. Through December 31, 2005, a cumulative total of 135 cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in Alaska in persons aged 13-24 years at first HIV diagnosis (13% of the 1,048 cumulative HIV/AIDS cases). Of the 135 cases, 97 (72%) cases were in males and 38 (28%) cases were in females. The proportion of HIV/AIDS cases fi rst diagnosed from 2001- 2005 in persons 13-24 years of age (12%) was sligh tly less than the propor tion first diagnosed in persons in this age gr oup from 1982-2000 (13%). Male-to-male sexual contact (MSM) represented, by far, the largest single risk for infection both for the total population of persons reported with HIV infection in Alaska through December 31, 2005 (48% of all cumulative cases ) and for the population of males only, where MSM accounted for 59% of cases. Injection drug use (IDU) as a single transmission category accounted for 14% of cumulative cases (12% of cases in males and 22% of cases in females). Cases with both MSM and IDU risks accounted for an additional 7% of total cases and 8% of cases in males. Heterosexual contact to a person at increased risk for HIV (for example, a known HIV-positive, an IDU, or, for females, a bisexual male) account ed for 15% of total cumulative cases (6% of cases in males and 51% of cases in females). Th e proportions of total cumulative cases related to 81 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile perinatal transmission, transfusi on or transplantation, or receipt of blood products for hemophilia remained low at 1%, each. HIV infection affected individuals in all racial and ethnic groups. In Alas ka, as in the U.S., the proportion of HIV/AIDS cases in Whites decreased in recent years. As a result, the proportion of HIV/AIDS cases in racial/et hnic minority persons increased. Of the 1,048 cases reported through 12/31/05, 606 (58%) were in Whites, 238 (23 %) in Alaska Natives/Am erican Indians, 98 (9%) in Blacks, 73 (7%) in Hispanics, 20 (2%) in Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 13 (1%) were of unknown race/ethnicity. Compared to their prop ortions of the state's population, Alaska Natives/American Indians, Blacks, and Hisp anics were over-represe nted among HIV/AIDS cases. HIV cases were reported from all regions of th e state through December 31, 2005. At the time of their first HIV diagnosis in Alaska, 672 cases (6 4%) had a reported residence of Anchorage/Mat Su, the most populous region of the state (53% of the state population resided in the Anchorage/Mat Su region in 2005). A total of 747 cases (71%) resided in the urban areas of Anchorage, Fairbanks or Juneau (60% of the st ate's 2005 population) at the time of their first HIV/AIDS diagnosis in Alaska. From 2001-2005, 36% of persons with Alaska reside nce at first HIV diag nosis developed AIDS within 12 months of thei r initial HIV diagnosis. Th is likely indicates diagnos is late in the course of their HIV disease. Late diagnosis limits an individual's potential bene fit from medical care and additionally indicates a lengthy period during which an infected person may have unknowingly transmitted HIV to others. Although a number of individuals with HIV are presumed to be unaware of their infection, HIV screening of the general population in Alaska has not been pa rticularly effective in identifying previously undiagnosed HIV infec tion. Different models of targ eted outreach associated with testing, some using rapid HIV test s, are being explored to identif y ways to best reach those at risk. Partner notificatio n activities, working with persons diagnosed with HIV to alert their sexual and needle-sharing partners of their e xposure, remain the most effective means of reaching persons at highest risk prior to symptomatic disease. From 2003-2005, partner notification activities identified 37% of all cases of HIV newly diagnosed in Alaska. Antiretroviral therapy is effective in reduc ing the potential for HIV transmission during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum, and has helped reduce perinatal infec tion rates in Alaska and nationwide. The majority of pregnant women in Alaska received HIV screening as part of their prenatal care through 2003. The occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) indicates sexual risk behavior, and individuals with STD are at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV through sexual contact, if exposed. Chlamydia and gonorrhea in fections occurred in many sexually active young adults in Alaska in 2005. The popul ation of individuals reported with HIV did not overlap to a great extent with populations re ported with gonorrhea or chlamydi a. In contrast, HIV infection was considerably more prevalent in persons identified with infectious syphilis from 2004-2005. 82 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile The following sections present detailed data on HIV infection in Alaska, expanding on the summary information provided in Chapter 2. Considerations Regarding Data and Methods The first case of AIDS was reported in Alas ka in 1982. Even though a test for HIV, the causative agent, had not yet been developed at th at time, the case was reportable to the Division of Public Health as an unus ual incidence of infectious di sease, and the provider sought consultation with the State's epidemiologists. AIDS became a condition specifically reportable to the Alaska Division of Public Health in 1985. A laboratory test for HIV antibody became commercially available in the U.S. in 1985 as well. In February 1999, HIV infection (without AIDS) was made a reportable condition in Alaska. Under current Alaska Ad ministrative Code (7 AAC 27.005 and 7 AAC 27.007), medi cal providers are required to report suspected and diagnosed cases of HIV infection and AIDS, and laboratories are required to report evidence of infection with HIV, to the Division of Public Health. For surveillance purposes, each HIV or AIDS case is counted only once, rather than once when reported with HIV and again when reported with AIDS. Most of the data presented in this appendix and in the Epidemiologic Profile Summar y (see Chapter 2) represent all cases of HIV or AIDS ever reported in Alaska, regardless of the state of residence at first diagnosis. This approach has been selected because these data are likely to represent i ndividuals with HIV who potentially need prevention and care services. Only when a table or figure title specifies that the data presented are specifically for \"Alaska ca ses\" do the cases repres ent individuals first diagnosed with HIV infection (with or without AI DS) while they were resi dents of the state of Alaska, regardless of where th at diagnosis occurred. Reported date of first HIV diagnosis is used as a substitute for HI V infection incidence, realizing that individual cases are diagnosed at different times, ranging from months to years after time of infection. Similarly, clinical detection of AIDS -defining conditions (the AIDS diagnosis) occurs at different points in th e disease continuum for different indi viduals. Date of first known AIDS diagnosis is used as a surrogate measure for AIDS onset. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented by year of first known HIV diagnosis (t o estimate onset of HIV infection) rather than by the year they were first reported to the Alaska Division of Public Health. After HIV reporting was introduced in February 1999, cases were reported in persons who had been diagnosed with HIV many y ears earlier as well as in pers ons who were more recently infected or recently diagnosed for the first time. Reports on HIV/AIDS cases diagnosed prior to 1999 were more likely than reports on more recently diagnosed cases to have some data elements incomplete. Since 1999, it has been possible to ga ther more complete data on some, but not all, of these earlier cases (some may have died, moved out of state, or have been otherwise lost to follow-up). People with HIV and AIDS undergo the same ki nds of life events as people without HIV infection -- they move into or out of Alaska, they may or may not interact with medical providers while they live here, and they may die of HIV or unrelated causes in Alaska or elsewhere. 83 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Multiple types of surveillance activities are necessary to provide a complete picture of HIV infection in Alaska. Reported dise ase data are considered to be i ndicators of the situation at any point in time, rather than definitive measures , and the data are used in conjunction with information about local conditions to guide public health interventions. Case numbers presented in this document may differ from data presen ted in other Section of Epidemiology reports because HIV/AIDS case data are updated on an ongoing basis as new case-related information becomes available. The following sections present available data in different ways to depict cumulative and current aspects of the HIV epidemic in Alaska. In many sections of this report, data are presented as proportions. It is important to recognize that proportions represented by each of the constituent elements must add up to the whole (100%, al though rounding of indivi dual proportions to the nearest whole number may result in their totaling slightly more or less than 100%). When one proportion decreases, one or more of the ot her proportions must in crease. A proportionate increase does not necessarily mean that rates have changed. It is important to consider the actual number of cases or events involved and rates, along with any change s in proportions, before drawing conclusions. Alaska case numbers are rela tively small and fluctuations over time may make proportions and rates relative ly unstable. All data must be interpreted in the context of cumulative scientific knowledge about HIV/AIDS. OVERALL HIV/AIDS CASE RATES IN ALASKA AND THE UNITED STATES Alaska AIDS and HIV case rates for the most rece nt five years, as well as the data used to calculate them, are presented below in Table 1. In Table 1 and Figure 1, Alaska HIV and AIDS cases are defined as those cases that were in Alaska residents at their first known date of HIV diagnosis, even if the diagnosis took place at a faci lity out of state. Case rates are expressed per 100,000 population. Because Alaska case numbers ar e small and may fluctuate from year to year, a five-year (2001-2005) mean annual rate is al so presented to offer a more stable estimate of the incidence rates in Alaska. The mean annual rate of Alaska AIDS cases (t hose first diagnosed with AIDS while Alaska residents) from 2001-2005, or the mean annual AIDS incidence rate, was 1.9 cases per 100,000 population. In comparison, the estimated 2004 AIDS in cidence rate in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia was 14.1 AIDS cases per 100,000 population (most recent published CDC data in HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, 2004, Vol. 16, Table 5a). The mean annual Alaska HIV incidence rate (cas es of HIV with and without AIDS that were Alaska residents at first HI V diagnosis) for the period fr om 2001-2005 was 5.1 cases per 100,000 population (Table 1). In comparison, the 2004 HIV/ AIDS incidence rate for the 33 states, plus Guam and the Virgin Islands, with confiden tial HIV reporting since 2000 was 20.7 cases per 100,000 population (Figure 1; U.S. rates were ca lculated from CDC data published in the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, 2004, Vol. 16, Table 5b). 84 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Table 1.

These data reflect the most current information available at the time of publication and, as a result, may differ from data in prior Section of Epid emiology publications. Through December 31, 2005, a cumulative total of 1,048 cases of HIV infection, with and without AIDS, were reported to the Alaska Division of Public Health (Table 2). 85 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Table 2.

In these two graphs/ tables, a death is re flected in the year the case was first diagnosed (rather th an the year in which the death occurr ed) to better reflect case mortality. These data illustrate the reduction in HIV mortal ity in recent years, primarily due to improved medical treatment, and also reflect earlier de tection of HIV infecti on in some individuals.

As the number of persons living with HIV continues to increase, needs for medical care, treatment, and supportive services will also grow. Additional data on pe rsons who are presumed living with HIV are presented later in this appendix. Gender Female - Of 1,048 cumulative HIV cases reported in Alaska through 2005, 202 cases (19%) were in females. The numbers and proportion of cases in females were smaller than in males, consistent with national trends. The average annual number of HIV cases among females in Alaska increased from 1982 through 2000 (from an av erage of 1 case per year to an average of 14 cases per year), then decreased for the peri od from 2001-2005 (to an average of 11 cases per year). The proportion of total cases occurring in females increased steadily over time, from 8% to 27%. In recent periods this proportionate increase was due primarily to a decline in the number and proportion of cases in males (Table 4). 87 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Male - Of 1,048 cumulative Alaska HIV cases, 846 cas es (81%) were in males. The average annual number of HIV/AIDS cases newly diagnose d in males decreased in time periods after 1990 (Table 4). Table 4.

Age Of HIV cases reported in Alaska, 741 (71%) were first diagnosed in individuals aged 25 to 44 years of age. Unlike some othe r areas of the U.S., relatively few HIV cases were reported among very young people in Alaska: 13 (1%) of 1,048 cases were aged 0-14, 23 (2%) were aged 15 -19, and 111 (11%) were aged 20-24 years at time of first HIV diagnosis (Figure 3, Table 5). Characteristics of persons di agnosed with HIV while adol escents/young adults (aged 13-24 years) are discussed la ter in this appendix. 88 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Figure 3.

The proportion of cases aged 35-44 years at first HIV diagnosis was gr eater for males (34%) than females (25%). Table 5. Cumulative HIV Cases (with and withou t AIDS) by Gender and Age at First Known HIV Diagnosis through December 31, 2005, Alaska N=1,048 89 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Transmission Category In order to have consistent national data that are comparable across ar eas, HIV/AIDS cases are categorized according to specific national definiti ons in a hierarchy the CDC has established to identify the risk factor most likely to have been responsible for transmission. Individuals who have more than one reported risk factor are co unted in only one exposure category (the category listed highest in the CDC hierar chy), except that men who report both sexual contact with other men and injection drug use make up a separa te CDC transmission category. Several CDC transmission categories are defined in ways that may not be intuitively obvious from the titles: Male-to-male sexual contact cases include men who report sexua l contact with other men (i.e., homosexual contact) and men who repor t sexual contact with both men and women (i.e., bisexual contact). Heterosexual contact cases include only those cases reporting hete rosexual contact with a person with, or at increased risk for, HIV infection (for exam ple, an injection drug user). Cases where contact was not with an infected person or a person known to be at increased risk are classified as No risk reported or identified. No risk reported or identified cases are in individuals with no reported exposure to HIV through any of the routes listed in CDC's hier archy of transmission ca tegories. This case classification additionally includes: cases currently under investigation by the health department; cases with incomplete exposure history because the person died, declined to be interviewed, or was lost to follow up; and cases that were interviewed or fo r which other follow-up information was available and no mode of exposure was identified. Newly reported cases of HIV infection are more li kely to have incomplete transmission risk information than cases reported earlier and for which risk information may have been added over time. 90 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Figure 4. Cumulative HIV Cases (with and without AIDS) by Transmission Category through December 31, 2005, Alaska (N=1,048) MSM/IDU 7% HIV Cases (with and wi thout AIDS), Transmission Category by Gender through December 31, 2005, Alaska (N=1,048) Males Females Total Transmission Category Number Column % Number Column % Number Column % Male-to-Male Sexual Contact (MSM) 501 59% NA NA 501 48% Injection Drug Use (IDU) 100 12% 45 22% 145 14% MSM and IDU 70 8% NA NA 70 7% Heterosexual Contact to At-Risk 101 100% Male-to-male sexual contact (MSM) represented, by far, the largest single risk for infection both for the total population of persons reported with HI V infection in Alaska (48% of all cumulative cases) and for the population of males only, wher e MSM accounted for 59% of cases. Injection 91 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile drug use (IDU) as a single transmission category accounted for 14% of cumulative cases (12% of cases in males and 22% of cases in females). Cases with both MSM and IDU risks accounted for an additional 7% of total cases and 8% of cases in males. Heterosexual contact to a person at increased risk for HIV (for example, a known HIV- positive, an IDU, or, for females, a bisexual male) accounted for 15% of total cumulative cases (6% of cases in males and 51% of cases in females). The proportions of total cumulative case s related to perinatal transmission, transfusion or transplantation, or receipt of blood products for hemophilia remained low at 1%, each. Of total cumulative cases, 147 cases (14% of all cases; 12% of males and 23% of females) were classified as having no transmissi on risk reported or identified (this category is defined more fully at the beginning of this section). This proportion, while significant, is considerably lower than that shown in the CDC 2004 HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report for all of the 42 U.S. areas with confidential name-based HIV inf ection reporting (28% of all a dult/adolescent cases; 24% of males and 36% of females). Some of the cases reported in Alaska with no risk identified, particularly those reported more recently, will be reclassified to other transmission categories over time as additional case-related information becomes available. Race/Ethnicity HIV affects individuals in all r acial and ethnic groups in Alaska. Although individuals are not at risk of HIV infection due to their race/ethnicit y, it can be an indicator of economic and social factors that may influence risk of exposure to HIV. Several studies in other areas of the country have documented misidentification of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) in disease surveillance databases an d on death certificates as evidence that HIV/AIDS cases among AI/AN were underreported nati onally. In contrast, misidentification of Alaska Native/American Indian cases is not a signifi cant problem in Alaska. A 1992 study by the Section of Epidemiology found no underreporting among AI/AN cases of AIDS in Alaska at that ti me. In 2002, the Section of Epidemiology again undertook an assessment of the accuracy of the race/ethnic ity data recorded for HIV/AIDS cases in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention and the Indian Health Service (IHS). The IHS National Patient Information and Reporting System served as the best available source for AI/AN status in the 2002 st udy. Of the 847 HIV/AIDS cases re ported in Alaska through June 2002, 182 were AI/AN; six (3.3% of the total) were found to have been inappropriately coded as White or Hispanic. These cases included four Am erican Indian and two Alaska Native cases. Coding was corrected on these cases in the Al aska data (and these changes are reflected throughout this report). An additional 15 cases cla ssified in the Alaska database as AI/AN were not found in the IHS database. These cases were retained as AI/AN cases in Alaska's database on the basis of other evidence. Data on all cumulative HIV cases by race/eth nicity are presented in Figure 5, and by race/ethnicity and gender in Table 7, below. Please note that the HIV case data classify 92 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile American 18%individuals of Hispanic ethnic ity as a separate race/ethnic ity category while the Alaska population data include individuals of Hispanic et hnicity within the other (race) categories.

A disproportionate representation of Blac ks and Hispanics in persons with HIV is also seen in the U.S. as a whole. Population data on Tables 8 to10 are estimates by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the 2005 Alaska pop ulation reapportioned into single race categories. Persons of Hispanic ethnicity are included within each of the race categories in these population estimates. The 2005 Alaska Hispanic population is also estimated separately. Table 8.

Very few HIV cases occur in pers ons younger than 15 years, but the population in the younger age groups is large and unevenly di stributed across the di fferent racial/ethnic populations. Additionally, the proportions of fe males and males differ across these populations. Table 9.

Geographic Region of Residence at First HIV Diagnosis in Alaska HIV cases were reported from all regions of the stat e. At the time of their first HIV diagnosis in Alaska, 672 cases (64%) had a repo rted residence of Anchorage/Ma t Su, the most populous region of the state (53% of the state popu lation resided in the Anchorage/Ma t Su region in 2005). A total of 747 cases (71%) resided in the urban areas of Anchorage, Fairbanks or Juneau (60% of the state's 2005 population) at the time of their first HIV/AI DS diagnosis in Alaska. Geographic region of residence at the time of firs t HIV/AIDS diagnosis in Alaska is shown in Figure 7 and Table 11 for cumulative cases of HIV/AIDS reported through December 31, 2005. The region of residence is define d as the region where the person re sided at the time of first known HIV diagnosis, when known. If this is not known, residence is defined as the region of residence at the time of first AIDS diagnosis . If neither of these is known, re sidence is defined as the region from which the earliest case report was receiv ed. The geographic areas identified represent the state's economic regions. HIV infection is generally asymptomatic for a lo ng period after initial in fection, and the population is highly mobile. These data must therefore be interpreted with caution. Residence at first known HIV diagnosis does not necessarily reflect the area where infection occurred or the area where the infected individual currently reside s or seeks care, if still living. 96 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Figure 7.

In or der to allow for comparison, given the small case numbers in Alaska, data on HIV infec tions that were first diagnosed within the past 5 years (2001-2005) and that had no t progressed to AIDS were select ed as indicators of recent infections. In the following tables and graphs , data on \"recent\" cases of HIV infection are compared to data on all cases of HIV without AI DS diagnosed prior to 2001 and all cases with AIDS (\"earlier\" cases). Gender Male - Of the 118 recent cases, 79 (67%) were in ma les. Of 930 earlier cases, 767 (82%) were in males. Female - Of the 118 recent cases, 39 (33%) were in fe males. Of 930 earlier cases, 163 (18%) were in females. Figure 8. Proportion of HIV Cases by Gender, Recent HIV and Earlier HIV/AIDS Cases (N=1,048, 118 Recent and 930 Earlier Cases) Recent HIV Cases Earlier HIV/AIDS Cases Females made up a larger proportion of recent than earlier cases (33% as compared to 18%). The proportion of males (67%) was slig htly less, and the proportion of females slightly greater (33%) among recent cases reported in Alaska than in cases of HIV without AIDS reported in 2004 in the 42 U.S. areas with confidential name-based HIV reporting (70% and 30%, respectively, CDC 2004 A: Epidemiologic Profile Age Cases in males diagnosed more recently tended to be slightly older than earlier cases.

The largest proportion of all recent HIV (54%) and earlier HIV/AIDS (65%) cases were in persons who resided in the Anc horage/Mat-Su region at the time of first HIV diagnosis in Alaska, although the pr oportion of recent cases with this residence was less than that of earlier cases. The proportion of recent cases residi ng in all other region s at first Alaska diagnosis increased compared to earlier cases, except for the Gulf Coast region, in which the proportions of recent and earlier cases remained th e same. The proportion of recent cases with out-of-state residence was greater in recent than earlier cases. Table 19.

To further geographically characte rize HIV infection, the distribution of cases is also presented below across four geogr aphic categories: (1) Ur ban Centers, combining Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau; (2) Sub-ur ban Areas, combining the Matanuska-Susitna and Kenai Peninsula Boroughs and excluding villag es not connected to Anchorage on the road system; (3) Rural Hubs, including the thirteen economic and transportation centers in the rural regions of Alaska and Southeast Alaska with populations ove r 2,000; and (4) Rural Communities, including the 260 incorporated an d unincorporated cities, census designated 107 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile places, and Alaska Native Villages outside of th e other categories as well as persons living outside of any community. The largest proportion of HIV cases resided in Urban areas at the ti me of first HIV diagnosis in Alaska, but the proportion declined in recent HIV cases (62%) as compared to earlier HIV/AIDS (72%) cases. The proportions of recent and earl ier cases were the same in Sub-urban areas, while greater proportions of recent th an earlier cases resided in all ot her areas at first diagnosis. Table 23.

The true number and characteristics of persons living with HIV in Al aska can only be approximated for a number of reasons: some infected persons ar e unaware of their infection (t hey have not been diagnosed), not all diagnosed cases have yet been reported, some reported cases no longer live here, and some out-of-state deaths in cases with prior Alaska residence are not reflec ted in case data. (Of the 704 persons reported with HIV/AIDS in Alas ka since 1982 and who are not known to have died, 94 were diagnosed prior to 1990.) The most straightforward approximation of HIV prevalence is provided by the number of persons with HIV reported in Alaska who are not known to have died. Data on the characteristics of these individuals (referred to below as \"presumed living\" and \"PLWHIV\") are presented below. Characteristics of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHIV) in Alas ka are similar to U.S. trends among persons living with HIV/AIDS, except for race /ethnicity. Data on transmission categories are difficult to compare because the CDC estimates redistribute cases with \"no risk identified\" into the other transmission categories according to statistical models, while these cases are shown separately in the Alaska data. The U.S. tr ends presented are estimates based on data from the 35 areas with confidential name-based HIV in fection reporting since 2000, and are presented in CDC's 2004 HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report (p.7). Of all PLWHIV, 78% of cases reported in Alaska were male, and 73% of U.S. adult/adolescent cases were male. 110 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile The largest single proportion of PLWHIV in Alas ka and in the U.S. was in the age group of 40-44 years (22% for each). Of male PLWHIV, 56% of Alaska and 60% of U. S. cases were in MSM; 14% of Alaska and 19% of U.S. cases were in I DU; 7% of Alaska and 13% of U.S. cases were exposed through heterosexual contact; and 8% of Alaska and 7% of U.S. cases were in MSM who also were IDU. Of female PLWHIV, 55% of Alaska and 71% of U.S. PLWHIV were exposed through heterosexual contact; and 18% of Alaska and 27% of U.S. PLWHIV were exposed through IDU. The proportions of the Alaska population by race di ffer from those of the U.S., and proportions of PLWHIV likewise differ: 58% of Alaska a nd 34% of U.S. PLWHIV were White; 23% of Alaska and less than 1% of U.S. PLWHIV we re Alaska Native/American Indian; 9% of Alaska and 48% of U. S. PLWHIV were Black; 7% of Al aska and 17% of U.S. PLWHIV were Hispanic; and 2% of Alaska and less th an 1% of U.S. PLWHIV were Asian/Pacific Islander. Gender Of the 704 HIV/AIDS cases presumed living as of December 31, 2005, 547 (78%) were male and 157 (22%) were female. Table 27.

The proportion of HIV/AIDS cases first diagnosed from 2001-2005 in individuals 13-24 year s of age (23 of 199 or 12%) is slightly less than the proportion first diagnosed in indi viduals in this age group from 1982-2000 (13%). Of the 135 total cumulative cases in individuals aged 13-24 year s at first HIV diagnosis, 97 (72%) cases were in males and 38 (28%) cases in females. For males aged 13-24 years at first HIV diagnos is, male-to-male-sex, injection drug use, and male-male sex combined with injection drug use accounted for 90% of cases through December 2005. For females aged 13-24 years at first diagnosis , heterosexual contact to a person with or at increased risk of HIV infection was the most si gnificant identified exposure risk (63% of cases), followed by injection drug use (11%). All races a nd ethnicities were represented in individuals aged 13-24 years at first HIV diagnosis, with the largest propor tions of cases in White and Alaska Native males, and in White, Alaska Nativ e, and Black females. The largest proportion of male and female cases resided in an Urban area of Alaska, with most residing in Anchorage/Mat- Su or Out of State at ti me of first HIV diagnosis. Gender Of the 135 HIV cases in individuals 13-24 years of age at first diagnosis, 97 (72%) were in males and 38 (28%) were in females. Of these 135 cases, 28 are known to have died. The year of first HIV diagnosis ranged from 1983-2005 for these cases. 114 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Transmission Category Table 32.

Of the 44 newly reported cases, 28 (64%) had their first known HIV diagnosis in 2005, 15 (34%) had an earlier HIV diagnosis da te, and one case had an unknown date of diagnosis. The data below represent cases newly reported to the Division for the first time in 2005, and are not necessarily the same cases shown in Figure 2 and Table 3 as having been first diagnosed in 2005. These two sets of case numbers are expected to differ. For example, a case first diagnosed with AIDS in 2004 and reported for the first time in 2005 would be considered newly reported in 2005. A new AIDS diagnosis in 2005 in a case pr eviously reported with HIV in 2000 would not be considered a newly reported case in 2005. Add itionally, some individuals with an earlier HIV 116 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile diagnosis move to Alaska from other areas and ar e subsequently reported in Alaska for the first time. Of the 30 cases of HIV without AIDS, 22 (73%) we re first diagnosed in 2005, 7 (23%) were first diagnosed prior to 2005, and 1 (3%) case had an unknown date of diagnosis. Of the 14 cases first reported in 2005 with AIDS, 7 (50%) had their first AIDS diagnosis in 2005 and 7 (50%) were diagnosed with AIDS prior to 2005. Of th e 14 cases newly reported with AIDS in 2005, 6 (43%) also had a first HIV diagnosis in 2005. Table 36. Cases First Reported with HIV and/or AIDS in Alaska in 2005 (N=44) Total reported with HIV and/or AIDS in 2005 44 Diagnosis of HIV (without AIDS) 30 HIV diagnosis in 2005 22 HIV diagnosis before 2005 7 HIV diagnosis date unknown 1 Diagnosis of AIDS 14 AIDS diagnosis in 2005 7 HIV diagnosis also in 2005 6 HIV & AIDS diagnosed at same time 3 HIV diagnosed in 2005 prior to AIDS 3 HIV diagnosis prior to 2005 1 AIDS diagnosis before 2005 7 PERSONS DIAGNOSED LATE IN TH E COURSE OF THEIR INFECTION From 2001-2005, 60 of 165 (36%) persons with Alaska residence at first diagnosis developed AIDS within 12 months of their in itial HIV diagnosis. This likely indicates diagnosis late in the course of their HIV disease, and late diagnosis limits an individual' s potential benefit from medical care. Late diagnosis additionally indi cates a lengthy period during which the infected person may have unknowingly transmitted HIV to others. Of the 60 cases, 46% were in males and 14% in females. The largest proportion (45%) was in the age category 40-49 years at first HIV diagnosis ; another 29% were between the ages of 25-34 years at first HIV diagnosis. Of the 60 cas es, 45% were in Whites, 28% in Alaska Natives/American Indians, 10% in Blacks, 8% in Hispanics, and 8% in Asians/Pacific Islanders. Transmission risk for 38% of cases was MSM, for 28% heterosexual co ntact to a person at increased risk of HIV infection, for 12% inject ion drug use, for 8% MSM/IDU, and for 12% not specified. Comparable data for the U.S. show that of a ll HIV infections diagnosed in 2003, 39% progressed to AIDS within 12 months after HIV infecti on was diagnosed. This occurred for a larger proportion of persons aged 35 years and older, IDUs, and persons exposed through heterosexual contact (CDC's Report , p.6). 117 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile HIV CARE SERVICE UTILIZATION The State of Alaska receives federal funding under Title II of the Ryan White CARE Act to purchase HIV care services for low income persons with HIV and their families as well as HIV medications. (Other in-state organizations including the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation also receive fe deral funding under different tit les of the CARE Act.) In 2005, a total of 325 HIV-positive individuals r eceived one or more services provided or purchased with CARE Act funds by one of the two State grantee organizations. These organizations have offices in Anchorage, Fairba nks, and Juneau and also serve individuals in other areas of the state. Of these 325 individu als, 37 (11%) were clients new to the service organizations during 2005. Males constituted 71% (230 individuals), females 29% (93 individuals), and transgender persons 1% (2 individuals) of the client population. Fifty individuals participated in th e AIDS Drug Assistance Program. Characteristics of individuals receiving serv ices funded with Title II CARE Act funds are presented below. Table 37. Demographic Characteristics of Title II CARE Act Clients in 2005 Characteristic Title II CARE Act Service Clients, 2004 (N=325) Gender Male 71% Female 29% Transgender 1% 11% Asian 2% Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander <1% More than one Race 1% Hispanic Ethnicity 9% Age Epidemiologic Profile PREVALENCE OF HIV INFECTIO N IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Civilian Applicants for Military Service. All civilian applicants fo r military service are screened for HIV infection. This include s individuals applying for active duty or reserve military service (including the National Guard), th e service academies, and the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). From October 1985 through December 2003, 24,628 (20,067 male and 4,561 female) individual applicants for military service in Alaska were teste d. Of these, 3 (0.01%) had test results showing HIV infection. All three were ma les, including one aged 20-24 years and two 30 years or older, with one White, one Black, and one of unspecified race. HIV SCREENING AND HIV PARTNER SERVICES Although it is likely that a number of individuals with HIV are una ware of their infection, HIV screening of the general population in Alaska has not been pa rticularly effective in identifying previously undiagnosed HIV infections. For exam ple, in 2005, data on HIV tests submitted to the State Virology Laboratory from four public health clinics that offer testing in the context of reproductive health services s how that of 3,269 individuals te sted, four (0.12%) were HIV- positive. In contrast, partner no tification activities, wo rking with persons diagnosed with HIV to confidentially notify their sexual a nd needle-sharing partners of th eir exposure, remain the most effective means of reaching persons at highest ri sk prior to symptomatic disease. In 2005, 46 HIV-positive individuals were interviewed for partners; 82 partners were notified by public health personnel; 67 of these partners accepted HIV counseling and testing, and 8 (12%) were newly diagnosed with HIV. The 8 cases identif ied through partner servic es constituted 29% of the 28 cases of HIV newly diagnosed in Alas ka in 2005. From 2003-2005, partner notification activities identified 37% of all cases of HIV newl y diagnosed in Alaska. Different models of HIV testi ng through targeted outreach in community settings frequented by persons at high risk, some using rapid HIV tests, are being explored to identify ways to best reach persons with undiagnosed HIV infection. SELF-REPORTED HIV TESTING The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Syst em (BRFSS) is a national survey developed by CDC to monitor state-level prevalence of the ma jor behavioral risks among adults. The BRFSS has been conducted yearly in Alaska since 1990 by the Alaska Division of P ublic Health. Health interviews are conducted by phone with adults 18 years and older. Data are statistically weighted to be representa tive of the state's population. The BRFSS interview includes several questions a bout HIV testing experience. Respondents are asked: \"Have you ever been test for HIV? Do not count tests you may have ha d as part of a blood donation.\" In 2004, 51% of respondents in of Alaska aged 18-64 years had ever had an HIV test aside from testing as part of donating blood. In 2005, 47% of Alaskans reported ever having had an HIV test. As shown in Figur e 15, Alaska has consistently been slightly higher than the nation in the percentage of persons who repor t being tested (State of Alaska 2006). 119 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Respondents are read a list of four HIV transmi ssion risk factors and, without specifying a risk, asked if any applied to them in the past 12 m onths. Risk factors include: use of intravenous drugs; treatment for STD; exchange of sex for m oney or drugs; and anal sex without a condom. In 2004 and 2005, 4% of respondents reported having pa rticipated in some high-risk activity in the previous 12 months. Figure 15.

The majority of pregnant women in Alaska received HIV scr eening as part of their prenatal care. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Survey (PRAMS). PRAMS is an ongoing national surveillance study conducted by states to collect information on maternal behaviors, attitudes, and experiences. The PRAMS includes a systema tic, stratified random sample of mothers who have given birth to live infants. Response data are statistically we ighted to represent the state's population of women with live births. Beginning in 1996, surveyed mothers were asked if their prenatal health care providers had (1) counseled them about HIV prevention and (2) discussed HIV testing with them. National PRAMS data indicate that discussion of HIV testing is highl y correlated with the occurrence of testing. The question on counseling was dropped from the survey after 1999. PRAMS survey results through 2003 (the most recent available PRAM S data) for the HIV- related questions follow. 120 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Table 38.

PRAMS data show a relatively large and consistent proportion of thos e women with live births reported discussion of (and likely testing for) HIV during pregnanc y. The number of HIV-infected women of childbearing age is relatively small but will c ontinue to grow as a dditional women become infected with HIV and infected persons live longer, healthier lives. Of the 202 cases of HIV/AIDS reported in females in Alaska, 157 were not known to have died as of December 31, 2005. Of these, 129 women were between the ages of 15-44 years as of December 31, 2005 and theoretically of childbearing age. It will be increasingly important to provide individualized services to HIV-positive women, including services related to their reproductive health and the health of their children, to increase the number of pregnant women receiving prenatal care, and to progress toward universal, voluntary HIV te sting as a routine part of prenatal care. INDICATORS OF POTEN TIAL RISK FOR HIV Reportable Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD). The most common reportable sexually transmitted infections in Alaska and the rest of the U.S. are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, in decreasing order of prevalence. Chlamydia infection is most common in adolescents and younger adults, especially females, in Alaska . Gonorrhea infection is less common than chlamydia, and most cases occur in young adu lts. Syphilis is relatively uncommon and most recent cases occurred in males. ST D are indicators of unprotected sex. 121 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile 0100200300400500600700 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 YearCases per 100,000 PopulationAlaska U.S.A relatively small number of individuals with chlamydia were ever reported with gonorrhea, indicating that these infections are associated not only with unprotected sex but also with participation in fairly distinct sexual networks . It was uncommon for persons with chlamydia and/or gonorrhea to have been reported with HI V infection, but a relati vely high proportion of recent cases of infectious syphili s in Alaska were in persons who had or had been recently exposed to HIV infection. Chlamydia in Alaska. Chlamydia rates have been high in Alaska since the infection was first made reportable in 1996. Rates of chlamydia infec tion have continued to in crease in Alaska and the U.S., and Alaska rates have ranked among the hi ghest in the U.S. in r ecent years. While the increase in cases reported in Alaska may, in part , represent a true increase in disease incidence, other likely contributors include r ecent improvements in disease det ection due to the use of more sensitive laboratory technology a nd non-invasive (urine) specimen collection methods, as well as increased testing of exposed partners and more screening of populations at risk of infection. Figure 16. Chlamydia Rates in Alas ka and the United States, 1996-2005 A total of 4,357 cases of chlamydia were repor ted in Alaska in 2005, a rate of 657 cases per 100,000 population. Case numbers in 2005 increase d 9% over 2004 and represented the largest annual increase since 2002. There were 2,910 (6 7%) cases reported in females and 1,447 (33%) in males. Of the 2,910 cases in females, 51 (2 %) were associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Figure 17. 2005 Chlamydia Rates in Alas ka by Sex and Epidemiologic Profile Highest 2005 chlamydia case rates in females were among those aged 20-24 years (5,046 per 100,000 females) and 15-19 years (4,075 per 100, 000 females). Highest 2005 chlamydia case rates in males were among those aged 20-24 years (2,633 cases per 100,000 males). Chlamydia case rates among males were highest in Blacks (1,800 per 100,000 males) and Alaska Natives/American Indians (940 per 100,000 males). Case rates among females were highest in Alaska Natives/American Indians (2,669 pe r 100,000 females) and Blacks (1,526 per 100,000 females).

Cases of chlamydia reported in Alaska from 1/4/96 through 5/17/06 (29,251 cases) were matched against all cases of HIV infection reporte d in Alaska through 5/15/06 (1,084 cases). Of all individuals ever re ported with HIV, 19 indi viduals (9 females, 10 males) were diagnosed with a chlamydia infection before or at the time of HIV diagnosis, and 19 individuals (11 females, 8 ma les) had one or more chlamydia diagnoses after HIV was diagnosed. Gonorrhea in Alaska . Gonorrhea rates have declined consid erably in Alaska since the historic highs recorded in the 1970's dur ing construction of the TransAla ska oil pipeline. Although they remain below U.S. rates, Alaska gonorrhea rates have increased in recent years. While this likely represents a true increase in disease inci dence, other likely contributors include recent improvements in disease detection due to the use of more sensitive laboratory technology and non-invasive (urine) specimen collection methods , as well as increased testing of exposed partners and increased screening of popul ations at greater risk of infection. 123 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Figure 19.

This represents a 4% increase over the number of gonorrhea cases in 2004. Of the 601 cases, 349 (58%) cases were in females and 252 (42%) cases in males. Of the 349 cases in females, 17 (5%) were associated with pelvic inflammatory disease. Highest 2005 gonorrhea case rates in females were among those aged 20- 24 years (500 per 100,000 females), 15-19 years (319 per 100,000 females), and 25-29 years ( 304 per 100,000 females. The highest 2005 gonorrhea rate in males was among those ag ed 20-24 years (322 per 100,000 males). Figure 20. 2005 Gonorrhea Rates in Alaska by Sex 124 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Gonorrhea case rates among males were highes t in Blacks (578 cases per 100,000 males) and Alaska Natives/American Indians (154 cases per 100,000 males). Case rates among females were highest in Alaska Natives/Amer ican Indians (387 cases per 100,000 females) and Blacks (269 cases per 100,000 females).

Cases of gonorrhea reported in Alaska from 2/1/72 through 5/17/06 (68,196 cases) were matched against all cases of HIV infection reported in Alaska through 5/15/06 (1,084 cases). Of all individuals ever reported w ith HIV, 103 individuals (34 females, 69 males) were diagnosed with a gonorrh ea infection before or at th e time of HIV diagnosis, and 14 individuals (2 females, 12 males) had one or more gonorrhea diagnoses after HIV was diagnosed. Syphilis in Alaska. Infectious syphilis was not a significant problem in Alaska for many years. An outbreak, largely confined to areas on the road system from Anchorage to Fairbanks, began in late 2004 and was still ongoing at the end of 2005. A total of 26 cases of early syphilis (primary, secondary, and early latent stages) we re reported between 9/1/04 and 12/31/05. Of the 26 cases, 22 (85%) were in males and 4 (15%) in females; 13 were in men who acknowledged same sex partners, 12 individuals had risks asso ciated with methamphetamine use, and a number of cases involved anonymous sex associated with use of the Internet. Of the 26 cases, 19 were in Whites, 4 in Alaska Natives/Ameri can Indians, and 3 in Blacks. HIV and Syphilis. All cases of syphilis reported in Alaska from 1/1/73 through 5/17/06 (1,054 cases) were matched against all cases of HIV infection reported in Alaska through 5/15/06 (1,084 cases). Of all individuals ever reported w ith HIV, 10 individuals (1 female, 9 males) had a syphilis diagnosis before or at the time of HI V diagnosis, and 5 individuals (1 female, 4 males) had a syphilis diagnosis after HIV was diagnosed. 125 Appendix A: Epidemiologic Profile Additionally, of the 26 cases of early syphilis (primary, secondary, and early latent stages) reported between 9/1/04 and 12/31/05, 7 (30%) were in individuals who either had HIV or had recently been named as a sex or needle shar ing partner of a pers on with HIV infection.

Cases of hepatitis C reported in Alaska from 12/18/89 through 5/17/06 (8,946 cases) were matched against all cases of HIV infection reported in Alaska through 5/15/06 (1,084 cases). Of all individuals reported with HIV, a total of 117 (34 females, 83 males) were ever reported with hepatitis C (11% of all HIV cases). Of these 117 individuals, 18 were diagnosed with hepatitis C diagnosis before or at the time of HIV diagnosis, and 99 were diagnosed with hepatitis C after HIV was diagnosed. Hepatitis B. Cases of hepatitis B repo rted in Alaska from 2/1/ 73 through 5/17/06 were matched against all cases of HIV infecti on ever reported in Alaska thr ough 5/15/06 (1,084 cases). Of all persons reported with HIV, a total of 8 (2 females, 6 males) were ever reported with hepatitis B, and none were reported after 1992. Hepatitis A. Cases of hepatitis A repo rted in Alaska from 1/1/ 72 through 5/17/06 were matched against all cases of HIV infec tion reported in Alaska through 5/15/06 (1,084 cases). Of all persons reported with HIV, a total of 7 (3 females, 4 males) were ever reported with hepatitis A. Tuberculosis. Cases of tuberculosis (T B) reported in Alaska from 1/1/72 through 5/17/06 were matched against all cases of HIV infection repor ted in Alaska through 5/ 15/06 (1,084 cases). Of all persons reported with HIV, a total of 20 (3 fe males, 17 males) were ever reported with TB. Of these, 5 cases had TB disease diagnosed before , 2 at the time of, and 13 after diagnosis with HIV. 126 Appendix A: Epidemiologic ProfileAppendix B Factors and Weighting for Preliminary Prioritizing Based on HIV and STD Data 2007-2009 Alaska HIV Prevention PlanAppendix B: Factors and Weighting fo r Preliminary Prioritizing Based on HIV and STD Data Target Populations by Risk Factor ; HIV/AIDS cases through 2005 Adult and Adolescents >15 year old Target Pop by Surveillance Category Factor Data Scale Rating Weight Score HIV/AIDS 2005 Prevalence # 1: 0 - 49 2: 50 - 99 3: 100 - 199 4: 200 - 299 5: 300 - 399 3 HIV 5 year Incidence # 1: 0 - 9 2: 10 - 19 3: 20 - 29 4: 30 - 39 5: 40 - >50 3 Relative Risk of Primary Risk Behavior 1: Heterosexual contact with person of unknown status and risk 2: Heterosexual contact with HIV positive or high risk partner 3: male with male sexual contact 4: Injection drug use 5: male with male sexual contact and injection drug use 1 Total Score 127 Appendix B: Factors and Weighting for Preliminary Prioritizing Basedon HIV and STD Data Target Populations by Demographics ; HIV/AIDS cases through 2005 Adult and Adolescents >15 year old; GC and CT cases in 2005 all ages.
