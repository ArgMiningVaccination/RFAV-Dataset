And loved it! Attended my first theyyam. It quite simply blew me awayThe new year could not have begun on a nicer note. In January , I travelled to north Kerala, an area that had been a big blank on my travel map. Frankly , I'm flummoxed. Why aren't more tourists discovering this charming destination? (For that matter, why hadn't I?) If you thought South Goa was quiet, try the pristine and social distancing-friendly beaches of north Kerala. The region also lays to rest the infernal beaches versus hills debate by simply having both. Head into the hinterland and you will find ascend hairpin bends into Wayanad, a wild and beautiful district somewhat tamed by the coffee and tea plantations that thrive here. It's not the Himalaya, but there was a distinct nip in the air in the evenings. The Edakkal Caves\u2014Wayanad's top attraction\u2014were a revelation, featuring neolithic rock art from the first millennium BC. Any day now they might make it to the Unesco World Heritage Sites list. And guess what? North Kerala even has backwaters, offering some relaxed sailing with a view uncluttered by too many other houseboats. I had an absolutely splendid time there and will share my experiences with you in an upcoming issue. I may have ventured a little far in my quest for a nice holiday , but you can have one in your backyard, with our list of quick weekend getaways from major Indian cities. Our features on Sohna and Nashik make it real and relatable. Everything else, as always, is a short flight away . Another spot of good news: foreign tourists may be returning to India soon\u2014preferably with a COVID vaccination certificate in tow\u2014with the Ministry of Tourism circulating standard operating procedures for the same among stakeholders.

Winters in Uttarakhand can be best experienced between November and February. Famously called Devbhoomi, Uttarakhand closes its routes to Chota Char Dham and other pilgrimage sites in November which ensures fewer crowds than usual. It enters the season with slushy snowfall and snowy slopes that make for a perfect winter destination for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts alike. The Sno W Zone Auli Located in the Chamoli district of Garhwal, Auli enjoys snowfall from November to February.

From its first snowfall of the year to the last, Mussoorie manages to charm every tourist that visits its ice-capped hills and assures them of a chilling escapade that they are unlikely to ever forget. Dhanaulti Situated in proximity to many other hill stations in the state, Dhanaulti is emerging as the new winter destination in Uttarakhand that tourists are increasingly flocking to. Surrounded by lush deodar forests, and less touristy spots, it is an ideal location for travellers seeking magnificent views of the Himalaya and a tranquil experience in the lap of nature. For The AD venTurouS Soul MukteshwarIdentified in Jim Corbett's book as 'the Temple Tiger' or 'Muktesar', this tourist destination is recognised for its pleasant panoramic views of the Himalayan range and thrilling adventure activities at its popular spot called 'Chauli ki Jali'.

November to March is considered a good time to enroll in a ski course and master the art of gliding down some natural snowy slopes. White Water rafting Chasing easy 'sweet sixteen' rapids to difficult 'double trouble' rapids in Rishikesh, water rafting is an adventure that many wish to experience once in their lifetime. Accompanied by an instructor, white water rafting does not expect one to learn swimming or have any rowing skills. Ideal for groups of friends and families, rafting makes you cherish some cool splashes in the River Ganges and leaves you feeling refreshed and motivated to try on other adventure activities in the place. Camping Whether it is trekking through unexplored trails, finding hidden waterfalls, setting up a tent and bonfire for the night, or spending a day or half by the mighty Himalayan range, camping in Uttarakhand comes in a wholesome package that cannot be missed. It is the best way to experience Uttarakhand and its natural beauty and captivating snowy landscapes. During winters, the state operates several camping destinations for travellers in places such as Mukteshwar, Pindari Glacier, and many others. TrekkingTungnath trek, fondly recognised for the highest Panch Kedar Temple on its peak, requires trekkers to walk through thick blankets of snow and visit the thousand-year-old temple. However, the trails towards the temple are open till November after which it is closed to avoid blocked roads and freezing climates. Throughout the trek, one can spot many named and unnamed peaks at a distance. The trek to Kedarnath is the kind that instills one with faith to reach even the highest of peaks. With pilgrims walking side by side, the experience of trekking through slippery snow patches and uneven, rocky paths becomes bearable and the eight to 12 hour wait before one finally enjoys a glimpse of snow-covered Kedarnath Temple seems worth it. Considered one of the best in the country, the Kedarkantha Trek provides the thrilling experience of climbing a Himalayan peak. Following the list are many easy and difficult treks like Nag Tibba trek, Chandrashila trek, Har Ki Dun trek, and Brahmatal trek. Get yourself a pair of tight gripped shoes and a few woolen apparel if you ever plan to trek in Uttarakhand. Paragliding There is no better way to witness the scenic beauty of Uttarakhand than to see it through the bird's eye, and with paragliding, you can make that wish come true. Accompanied by trained professionals, it is easy to opt for tandem paragliding at places like Mukteshwar, Nainital, and Ranikhet that present breathtaking vistas of tall oak forests, and snow-capped Himalayan ranges that add to the grandeur of the scene. Ziplining From fearlessly moving across lakes in Nainital to feeling the thrill while crossing over the Ganges in Rishikesh to holding on to those ropes a little tighter at Mussoorie, the fun of ziplining is worth adding to your bucket list. Moreover, with near to zero hazards, ziplining is considered one of the safest and easy adventure activities for adults. Canoeing Canoeing and kayaking are the two major water sports in Uttarakhand that are avidly enjoyed by tourists from around the country. Nainital has pristine lakes that offer canoeing in its free flowing waters. However, if you wish to take your canoeing experience a notch higher, consider doing a week-long course in Rishikesh. It will teach you to row your kayak through rapids and train you with the required equipment. Shivpuri, 16kms from Rishikesh is one of the most frequented white water rafting destinations in Uttarakhand. Paragliding is one of the most exhilarating experiences that one can enjoy in the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan range.

The Noh Ka Likai Falls in the East Khasi Hills boasts of a thousand-feet-plunge at the precipice of a plateau, and offers a panoramic scene of dramatic cliffs, fascinating pools, and abundant forests. Treks to the bottom of the falls are excessively rewarding, and notorious for rapid transitions in terrain. Another gem is upper Shillong's Elephant Falls displaying a stream of water surging over a slope fashioned with multiple levels, and shepherding tourists into a lake-bound descent via railed walkways. Unwind here by wading in knee-high waters, and indulging in photography. Memo, Tasek, Ward's, and the Umiam lakes, too, leave visitors spoiled for choice. Nestled in the east Garo Hills, the tranquil Lake Tasek's formation is the result of an earthquake. It lies at a distance of about 220 kilometres from Shillong. Inhabited by indigenous fish, the lake is skirted by vegetation, an eco-lodge, and migratory birds. On the other hand, Ward's, an inner-city lake in Shillong, is accessorised with psychedelic paddle-boats, a wooden bridge, flower-beds, and grassy slopes, while Memo, situated in the East Garo Hills, is bedecked with an ancient bridge reminiscent of the bygone era, and invites onlookers to revel in the sight of its close-packed trees breaking the afternoon sunlight. Dovetailing into gushing waters, Meghalaya's lakes and waterfalls function as a portal to utopia, and acquaint travellers with unparalleled views. Brimming with a multitude of choices, the state is peppered with the likes of Krang Shuri, Dainthlen, Noh Waterfalls; and (facing page)the pristine waters of the Dawki r iver tRa VeL pRoMotion Caves, hikes, and Treks Transcendental in its own right, Meghalaya's mystique lies in its caves. Like a siren, its lairs lure you in, and usher you into a space reflecting a coalescence of bizarre formations, un- divulged secrets, and astounding visuals. A fossil-riddled Arwah Cave, located at the seams of Sohra, mimics a maze-like arrangement due to its endless curves, and comprises a chamber-like gateway unwinding into a series of caverns. During the walk, you will stumble upon fish bones and crustacea shells fossilised in its walls, and witness the surging falls of Lawshynna Hill gracing one part of the daunting hike. The Mawsmai Cave, in close proximity to Sohra, fosters a system that necessitates a tad bit of (physical) adjustment to access other areas, and packages a zip-lining facility, a cup of chai, and a short hike\u2014defined by trilling birds\u2014into one experience. About 250 kilometres from Shillong, Siju Caves, alias Bat Cave, pave way for travellers through its arched entrance. Complemented by a hike, the path leading up to the structure is fractionated into meandering streamlets, and lush The trek to Nongriat, unique for its double-decker bridges, close to village Tyrna, displays roots of banyan trees weaving themselves into one another, and forming bridge-like structures suspended over the river. Rocks swaddling pools are a sight you will encounter during this trek clockwise from here: the cherry blossoms in full bloom during the festival; performers at the Wangala festival; and the shad suk mynsiem celebrations in the statetRa VeL pRoMotion rock formations. Billed as one of the most extensive systems in the world, Siju Caves introduce you to underground streams, lakes, a lodge, and visuals of Garo Hill's terrain. Meghalaya's treks, too, are iconic. About 65 kilometres from Shillong, and close to the village of Tyrna, the Nongriat Root Bridges, a testament to the enigma of botanical architecture, entails a descent spanning over three thousand steps. The trek, unique for its double-decker bridges, displays roots of banyan trees weaving themselves into one another, and forming bridge-like structures suspended over the river. Rocks swaddling pools are a sight you will encounter during this trek. Here, you can reserve your energy for what's about to come. An intense voyage to Rainbow Falls, just beyond the multi- layered formation, presents to tourists a sparkling pool and gargantuan boulders. A hidden gem, Rainbow Falls is nothing short of magical. Adding another feather in its hat, Meghalaya's natural bounty is home to the Nokrek Biosphere Reserve, a designated biosphere reserve, that embodies the beauty of the Garo Hills, and is home to hoolock gibbons, Asiatic elephants, and the oldest citrus fruit species to wanderers. Explore this reserve's nuances from Chandigre Village, featuring traditional huts, and a quaint resort. In shadowing the 16-kilometre trek, cruise past the countryside, plantations, and charming villages before the exploration of the reserve ensues. For the intrepid traveller, the Laitlum and Smit trek is another option. The juxtaposition of Smit, hankered after for its countryside visuals, and Laitlum Canyon, usually shrouded with fog, culminates in a path flanked by pines, tRa VeL pRoMotion Billed as one of the most extensive cave systems in the world, Siju Caves introduce you to underground streams, lakes, a lodge, and visuals of Garo Hill's terraintRa VeL pRoMotion Inside the siju caves in meghalaya tRa VeL pRoMotion tRa VeL pRoMotion waterfalls, streams, and stairways that plummet into a valley dotted with a variety of settlements. Cuisine and Shopping A part of Meghalaya's culture translates itself into a series of platters fashioning indigenous cuisines. Traditional fare, such as Ktung Bain Nei-Iong, or dry fish garnished with sesame seeds; Wak Tangsek Pura, or pork, complemented by vegetables, powdered rice, and indigenous soda; Doh Sain, or pork cooked with sesame seeds; and Jadoh, Dohkhlieh and Tungrymbai, a conjunction of rice, pork, pork salad, fermented soybeans, and sesame seeds, is deemed one of the many manifestations of the state's diversity. Apart from this, Meghalaya's Shillong brims with marketplaces specialising in handicrafts, streetwear, traditional apparels, fruits, honey, and forest products. A promenade through Khyndailad's recesses chaperones you past street food, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, and clubs, while an expedition in Lewduh involves weaving your way through intertwining streets thronging with people, buildings, and platforms. With a kaleidoscopic scene at play, saunter past clothing, electronics, fruits, spices, and the ensuing chaos unfolding in every crevice of the market. Festivals and Culture A much-sought after event, Meghalaya's Cherry Blossom Festival, distinct to Shillong, assimilates a wave of attractions, activities, and programmes into its fold. Festooned with a hue of powder-pink, the capital's trees evolve into blossoms toward the end of the year. The festival was legitimised in 2016 and witnesses the flowers birth in October, mature into November, and can be seen in full bloom in December. The festival features various attractions across venues such as the Ward's Lake and the JN Sports Complex, and familiarises visitors with the state's traditional and contemporary culture. Wangala, a harvest festival, witnesses the unification of Meghalaya's Garo community, and orchestrates the convergence of traditional dances, local cuisines, and unique beverages. Shad Suk Mynsiem, predicated on agriculture, unique to the Khasi Hills, and an amalgamation of dance-cum- music, expresses a sense of gratitude towards the creator, and promotes an appreciation for the harvests received by the people. During Behdeinkhlam, a monsoon-oriented formality, the Pnars of Meghalaya reminisce about their indigenous beliefs, history, and folklore via acts, performances, and rites, while anticipating a bountiful harvest.Festooned with a hue of powder-pink, the capital's trees evolve into blossoms toward the end of the year.

It was as though a child recognising colours for the first time. But in my defense, Delhi skies barely looked like this on rare, fateful days. I wasn't fully done embracing the warm blue when I was made aware of the Aravallis all around me. I lunged deeper into my thoughts in split seconds and I couldn't help but think of that precise moment as an epiphany of sorts. My trail of thought was broken by the chirping birds and a slight sizzle from the kitchen. I had almost forgotten the hunger pangs that seemed endless a while ago. I walked inside the dining hall, right next to the terrace, and the aroma of the spread pretty much indicated the beginning of a cosy weekend ahead. I made my way to the Khohar Haveli after what seemed like an endless journey . The excruciating traffic and my pandemic-and ending up in their village. The air around Khohar Haveli is engulfed in history . For one, it is nestled amid the oldest mountain ranges in the country , the Aravallis, which has seen various civilisations flourish in its lap. \"These 17th-century havelis had been long forgotten until the early 1980s when Aman (Nath) chanced upon them with the help of his former student, \" I was told over the cosy lunch spread, by Yogi and Ambar Vaid, who now own and run the place. The Khohar Haveli(s) are actually twin havelis, a stone's throw away from each other, which were acquired by Aman Nath in 1984 and 1988. The discovery of these havelis was just the beginning of a long road ahead, but one that Aman Nath particularly loves\u2014restoration and revival. Covered IN DeNse yet tamed vegetation, the fa\u00e7ades of both the havelis continue to bask in the glory of their former days. The narrow passage from the gate leading inside is graced with the history of the havelis on one wall, while its adjacent one sports ancient paraphernalia, including primal keys that have kept the havelis safe over the years. A few steps ahead bring you face to face with a jasmine tree\u2014planted by Aman Nath\u2014right in the centre, surrounded by a cosy , comfortable seating arrangement, under the open, natural canopy . At Khohar, it's all about the details and the tiny elements that lend it the old world charm. Remnants of the past here range from antique mitti items to furniture.

A couple of brakes and jerks, here and there, and finally I was out of the city bounds. The transition from the city only took a few minutes; accelerating two wheelers now replaced the heavy-duty traffic and the dusty , wide roads paved way for narrow, cobbled lanes, flanked by mustard fields on either side. And the little Bollywood in me couldn't help but think, \"Ja Simrran ja.... \" I occasionally also blame my acquaintances who've inundated me with the reference.

No two rooms are alike with the differences lying in their shapes, adornments, colour scheme, bedding arrangements and the area that they are spread across. A narrow arched path from the jasmine tree opens up the space to a sprawling garden, named Tara Bagh.

One cannot help but wonder how they managed. And not just managed, the foundation seems to be so strong, that they stand rock solid even today .

Harchand ji, the caretaker, quickly rushed to switch on the fountain, followed by the incandescent lights so that I do not miss out on the twilight glow that was in store. There is a strange kind of stillness here post sundown. The noisy children backed up within the homes, the cattle on the Aravalli well-fed and now resting, the hookah smoking elders retired and the village goes eerily quiet. And I won't lie, the stillness seemed daunting at first, but once you get used to the silence, there is no going back. I retreated to the terrace for dinner under the starry sky , with cricket sounds for company . Chef Mushtaq's ability to spin culinary magic in a short span of time deserves a special mention. My city-oriented digestive system was surprised at the wholesome, fresh produce that now graced the table. Ambar's not-so- little passion project is a kitchen garden in the adjacent haveli's backyard. Cauliflower, beetroot, cabbage, spinach....all are farm fresh and make it to the dinner table, without any pesticides, shortly after they've been harvested. The next morning was a misty one unlike yesterday's and called for a coal-charred chai with fresh milk from just across Tara Bagh. Post breakfast, Harchand ji swiftly transformed into my tour guide. A short trip around the village was up first. One often fails to recognise the simplicity of things in the fast-paced city life. It is at places like Harchandpur that you are grounded, even though for a short while. A few confused glances from the villagers, but mostly warm, welcoming smiles sure did set the mood right for the day . Next up, was a short birding expedition near the village pond, which is one of the favourite spots of migratory birds making their way to the village. I spot the white-throated kingfisher, a few ducks and a stork and blame the mist for the rest.

In case you are in the mood to enjoy some lip-smacking freshly baked produce, sample Bakes and Brews, a 24/7 bistro that offers a casual dining experience. However, a trip to Nashik is incomplete if you don't indulge in the authentic local fare. Don't miss the savoury and spicy misal pav, another classic Maharashtrian snack at Ambika Misal, an eatery that is loved by both locals and visiting tourists alike. While Nashik is a city where history meets mythology and its proximity to Shirdi is no doubt responsible for its new-found emphasis on spiritual awakening as we discovered, it is this place's lovely and peaceful vibes and its inspiring views that encourage you to stay an extra day . And if adventure and thrill is what you are actively seeking, by far one of the most meaningful and exhilarating ways to experience Nashik's dramatic beauty and serene culture is by trekking to the Pandavleni Caves located at a height of approximately 300 ft, amid a thick green forest. The land that surrounds this almost seems like a botanist's fantasy . Organised treks take visitors along verdant footpaths, through tiny villages, following unspoiled routes along lush ridgelines, and past many tiny lakes. Keenly observe the long burst of creativity including some beautifully painted frescoes that may have happened during the reign of ancient Indian dynasties. If you are one who is intrigued by ancient legends, do make it a point to visit some offbeat cave temples such as the Sita Gumpha carved from solid rock faces.

You can even ask the staff at the accommodation of your choice to organise visits with experts to nearby ancient temples and local vineyards upon request. So if you are looking for a quick getaway from either Mumbai or Pune head to Nashik.

So if you are fancy free and looking for a relatively less-crowded destination why not head to Dwarhatta, about 60kms and around two hours' drive from the city? So on the first Sunday of January , we decided to explore Dwarhatta, along with its lesser-known neighbouring towns of Antpur and Rajbalhat. Our first halt was at Antpur, a village known for its terracotta temples and for its association with the Ramakrishna Vivekananda Order. It was in an open-air corner of the ancestral house of Swami Premananda that Swami Vivekananda and eight other disciples of Ramakrishna Paramahansa lit a sacred fire on Christmas Eve of 1886 for meditation, following which they discoursed on the teachings and sacrifices of Jesus Christ, ultimately deciding to renounce the world and become monks dedicated to serving the people. Thus, the seed of the Ramakrishna Order was planted. The space where the holy fire was built is now enshrined. Beyond this is a two-storey building where the rooms where Swami Vivekananda and Sarada Devi (wife of Ramakrishna Paramhansa) stayed for a while have been preserved. After a brief tour of the Ramakrishna Mission premises, we stopped by the temples belonging to the Mitra family . The best preserved is the Radha Govinda Temple built in 1786. Take the help of a guide from the temple office to show you the various terracotta panels of the temple built with the motto of exhibiting religious tolerance. Each panel is different. Apart from tales associated with Krishna, the panels depict rulers of various faiths, friezes drawing inspiration from Islamic architecture, portrayals of maritime ventures, influences of European culture, etc. There are also terracotta temples dedicated to Shiva and a Dol Mancha (a temple associated with the celebration of Holi) next to the main temple premises. hunger paNgs remINDeD us that it was lunch hour. We decided to head to Dwarhatta where we had taken a day booking at the Mondwarika Resort, which had promised us a sanitised environment. The resort itself was interesting, made of old and discarded automobile tyres, an idea that owner Prabir Sinha Roy brought home from his visits to Germany . \"What interested me most was the warmth these tyre-made homes provided during the freezing winter in Germany , \" he said. For the walls, the tyres are packed with mud, waste building materials, etc. Driven by his passion for environment-friendly buildings and recycling, Sinha Roy took the idea further Intricate terracotta carvings on the temple walls *did you know that the Mondwarika Resort in dwarhatta uses discarded automobile tyres as a part of construction material for walls? you can buy a bengal handloom saree at Rajbalhat, also known for its Shweta kali temple.outlook tra Veller 63 antpuR eXpLoRe being offered to visitors. The resort is surrounded by paddy fields and local trees, making it a good place to try bird watching. after a typIcal home-made Bengali lunch, we walked down to the Raj-Rajeshwar Shiva Temple of Dwarhatta. This terracotta temple built in 1728 still retains the intricately carved panels while several temples have been given a contemporary makeover during renovation. David McCutchion (1930- 1972), the English academic considered one of the authorities on Bengal terracotta temples, had found temples in Dwarhatta which were rare examples of pancharatna temples with slender turrets. Further down a winding village road was the Dwarika Chandi Temple. Revered by pilgrims, the temple has lost its ancient architectural appeal during a wide-scale repair work. Inside the sanctum sanctorum is the idol of a four-handed goddess Durga with her children, and consequently draws a large crowd during the annual autumn festival. Owing to paucity of time, we could not visit Rajbalhat, known for its temple dedicated to Rajballavi, an incarnation of Shakti. She is also known as Shweta Kali (White Kali). Once the capital of the former Bhursut principality of south Bengal, the village is home to weavers of traditional Bengal handloom sarees. If you are planning an overnight trip, then you can combine Antpur and Rajbalhat before making your way to Dwarhatta. the entrance with terracotta panels by reusing old glass bottles to use them to build beds. Imagine our surprise when one of the staff members lifted the bedding to show us how the bottles have been packed with mud and other materials to build the main bed. \"I am a member of several clubs of Kolkata and never run out of my supply of recycled bottles, \" he added with a smile.

Not only has the addition of this infrastructure transformed the landscape of Patnitop with its state-of-the-art ropeway that connects Sanget Valley , but by taking a lead in green mobility , it has also eliminated a 45-60 minute road journey by way of a picturesque gondola ride of over 2.8 kms to the destination in just about 10-12 minutes. The project has emerged as a leading promoter of responsible mountain adventure and lifestyle tourism in Jammu and Kashmir owing to its unique offerings, location, and hospitality . It is actively looking to drive tourism to this unexplored paradise with its clean air, unique landscape, endemic flora and wildlife, biodiversity and the timeless local culture and history . The destination is an ideal getaway for tourists who visit Katra as an annual ritual and for those looking to combine or extend their stay in Patnitop. Skyview Patnitop aims to put this hill station on the map of adventure and leisure tourism. For those who are always seeking an adrenaline rush, there's Asia's longest zig-zag zipline measuring 580 metres, an all-season tubing sledge of 238 metres and India's first magic carpet measuring 162 metres. Their new vertical, Skyview Adventure Valley , also offers several specially curated packages including a first-hand experience of the local culture, ancient religious heritage, cuisine, diverse flora and fauna and a stunning natural landscape. The initiative includes day trips to Nathatop and Sanasar. During winters, guests can also look forward to snow-based activities here including a 2.5km hiking experience on the Skyview Leisure Trail and a recreational exploration of Patnitop's meadows and the 600-year- old Naag Mandir. For those who love the outdoors, new offsite activities such as hiking, mountain biking and birding in the surrounding hills are being introduced. For nature lovers and avid bird watchers, the hiking trails around Skyview Adventure Valley make for an ideal escape. Over 100 species of birds can be found here including the red-billed blue magpie, brown rock chat, pied bush chat, grey bush chat, scaly-bellied woodpecker, black- and jungle myna to name a few. Birders are led by a naturalist who helps track, observe and photograph different species. The company has recently introduced mountain terrain biking (MTB) in the Sanget Valley , in the foothills of Patnitop. The mountain terrain biking trail is a guided adventure sport in which participants\u2014newbies as well as mountain biking enthusiasts\u2014are accompanied and led by a qualified instructor. All participants are provided with special mountain bikes, safety gear and a meal & beverage snack pack. The two-hour, 14km ride starts from the lower terminal of Skyview Patnitop located in Sanget Valley and goes along the same route as the gondola that connects Sanget to Patnitop. The scenic ride traverses a winding uphill mountain road that passes quaint villages, fields and pristine pine and deodar forests, and then makes its way back to the lower terminal. The new vertical after a meticulous survey of both Sanget Valley and Patnitop, has identified multiple trails appropriate for the MTB rides. In addition to the existing activities, Skyview Patnitop will also be introducing more leisure and adventure activities in the coming months.

Is it an ocean? It's...the Brahmaputra. If the coruscating waters of this mighty river are a sight to behold, then the new Bogibeel Bridge straddling it near Dibrugarh nearly steals the sheen. The Brahmaputra fills you with awe and trepidation in equal measure. India's longest rail-cum-road bridge, which runs for nearly five kilometres over the river, is an engineering marvel and a thing of manmade beauty . More importantly , it has cut down travel time between Assam and eastern Arunachal drastically , making a truly untouched part of India more accessible. The drive to Pasighat was pleasant, past small\u2014but not sleepy\u2014villages and proud homesteads fronted by neat gardens. The hill town was established by the British in 1911 as an administrative outpost to better govern the greater Abor Hills and the northern territories. Someday soon it will be developed as a Smart City . The first thing you notice about Arunachal Pradesh is how few people there are. This massive state, with a land area of nearly 84,000 sq km, has the second- lowest population density among Indian states (the least populous is Ladakh). The second is a noticeable change in the foliage, which, unlike the population, is impressively dense. I was staying at the Abor Country River Camp, here to attend the tail end of the Siang Rush 2020, a promotional activity by Arunachal Tourism whose signature event is a short whitewater rafting expedition down the Siang; hence the name. Oken Tayeng of Abor Country Travels & Expeditions is the super-enthu, seemingly ageless organiser of the Siang Rush (2020 marked the third edition of the event). Once I had made his acquaintance, I knew the Rush could not be in better hands (for one, he does not rush things overmuch). Each year, the Rush follows a different itinerary , showcasing a new part of Arunachal. The other participants, a clutch of India's best boutique tour operators and agents, were more intrepid than me and had started their tour several days earlier. They had been richly compensated for their long cab rides across rafting on a relaxed stretch of the siang in arunachal pradesh PHotogRAPHS couRtESy: SiAng RuSH feBruary 2021 68aR unaChal pRadesh eXpLoRe it's a tumult. The swell in winter was still impressive, so I can only imagine what effect the monsoon has on it. This was my amuse-bouche. The main course would be served when the group attempted the rapid later in the trip. At the camp\u2014which offers both a traditional Abor house and tents overlooking the Siang\u2014I had the good fortune of occupying the same bed Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao had slept on when they visited the newly-opened camp in 2016. This has, apparently , created a niche demand for the room, especially among Assamese guests. The participants arrived, full of stories, and brought me up to speed on all they had seen so far and what they thought of Arunachal. They seemed charged and curious\u2014which every traveller should be. Ajeet Bajaj of Snow Leopard Adventures gave a riveting talk about his 2018 Everest climb, which he did with his daughter Deeya. Next morning, our day began with a round of yoga, led by Naina Ngilyang, who conducts her classes in state capital Itanagar and specialises in aerial yoga. By the time we had gone through her punishing stretches (\"Shall we do 10 surya namaskars today?\"), I think we could the length of Arunachal, taking in the dzong at Dirang, the sprawling Tawang Monastery , the stunning Sela Pass, the moving Jaswant Garh War memorial, the ebullient Nuranang Falls, the historically important Thembang Fortified Village, and much more. They had also had an opportunity to share with the honourable Chief Minister their views on the sort of tourism Arunachal should promote and which its fragile and unique ecosystem can sustain. I lolled for a day at the river camp, waiting for my fellow travellers to arrive, and enjoyed every minute of it. Since I was anything but gainfully occupied, I took my driver up on his offer to show me a viewpoint further upstream on the Siang. We ascended gently , eventually arriving at a rocky outcrop set high above the valley of the Siang, and clearly popular with the locals. Here was a bend in the river, swirling eddies, hidden whirlpools perhaps, and a palpable increase in the water's velocity . The view was mind blowing. I had seen the Brahmaputra earlier only in Guwahati, where it is positively oceanic\u2014and tame when not in spate. In the upper reaches, Arunachal Pradesh offers a lot of adventure activities for the active tourist. Even for a single activity like rafting, there are multiple options to choose from. Rivers noted for rafting in Arunachal are the Siang, kameng, Subansiri and Dibang. each year, the Rush follows a different itinerary, showcasing a new part of arunachal. the other participants, a clutch of india's best boutique tour operators and agents, were more intrepid than me and had started their tour several days earlier setting up a scenic camp along the siang riveroutlook tra Veller 69 the siang r iver is beautiful near pasighatfeBruary 2021 70aR unaChal pRadesh eXpLoRe pretty much fly . Then, finally , it was time to go rafting. Before we set foot in our rafts, however, we visited Rottung, a village near the kick-off point surrounded by high mountains, a village that has spruced itself up because it wants to be cleanest in the state. Here we were subjected to some heartfelt rural hospitality . There was singing and a lilting dance in honour of the visitors, followed by a delicious meal where rice was served in leaf packets. An afternoon well spent, before we headed down to the river for our first bout of rafting. After state officials declared the Siang Rush properly open, we pushed off into the cold, cold waters, clutching our life jackets for, well, dear life, paddles at the ready . In the end, the rafting was fairly tame. And for this I am grateful.

The high point of the ride was splashing each with the freezing waters of the Siang. Who could have imagined a decade ago that we would be doing Facebook Lives beamed around the world while hurtling down a rapid in a raft on the Siang? There were tributes too for Akshay Kumar of Mercury Himalayan Explorations, an adventure travel visionary whose recent and untimely passing had left all of us shocked. In fact, Akshay was scheduled to lead the rafting section of the Siang Rush 2020 and would have been with us. But the universe had other plans. After a few hours we pulled over on to a white sand beach. As if almost overnight, a veritable tent city had sprung up here, our home for the night. (The next morning it would be gone, leaving no trace, just memories for a lifetime.) It was a moonlit night, and, over drinks, a singer from Pasighat with a dulcet voice belted out old Hindi numbers. There was grilled mithun and pork curry . Some fresh apong had been rustled up. Then, karaoke took over. Tourism's gain is music's loss, I thought to myself as Oken regaled us with one Elvis number after another. Under the blazing moon, on that white sand beach of the Siang, this was a heady mix. And I can say , without a doubt, that camping on the river was the high point of the trip for me. Despite the revelries, there was no relenting from Naina, so there was yoga on the beach next morning. Some of us headed out to Dibrugarh, for a chat with the Jalans, venerable tea planters of the region, and to spend a sublime night at their Mancotta Chang Bungalow. The others rafted down from the Rottung camp to Pasighat, getting off near the Abor Country River Camp, bringing the latest Siang Rush to a close. Key takeaways from the trip? Arunachal is a niche destination, and can't really be developed as a mass market proposition. More accommodation options need to be created and tourism should not focus on just one or two main destinations. Eco- tourism, community-based initiatives, culture and adventure tourism seem to be their best bets. Here's hoping that by the time the next eagerly awaited Siang Rush rolls around, there will be positive interventions and visible changes on the ground. I, for one, can't wait to get back. T Apart from rafting and kayaking, visitors to Pasighat can also visit the Daying Ering memorial Wildlife Sanctuary. located 13km away, it is home to species like tiger, leopard, takin, hoolock gibbon, red panda, slow loris and capped langur. the sanctuary is also home to several species of resident birds as well as a haven for many migratory ones. in the end, the rafting was fairly tame. and for this i am grateful. i promptly reserved a seat in the oar raft, where paddling was, um, optional. the high point of the ride was splashing each with the freezing waters of the Siang* initially called nefa (north-east frontier agency), the state was renamed arunachal pradesh on January 20, 1972 some happy rafters on the siang rush 2020feBruary 2021 72 theRetreat Yoga, meditation and divine healing in a blessed corner of Punjab.

By the time we finish, the sun has risen. The soul is nourished. Now the body must be attended to. So, there's yoga, followed by a piping hot breakfast (oh, those veg cutlets). After a break, there's a round of pranic healing. In the evening, almost the same routine is repeated. It's really as simple as that. Or is it? Inside the mind are a million mad thoughts. Voices that refuse to shut up. Visions more persistent than your Instagram feed. Meditation? Easy yet difficult.

What do you do when you have achieved everything in life\u2014at least all the usual material things one aspires to? What next? Two decades and many spiritual adventures later, Mittal is a changed man, with a twinkle in his eye and an easy laugh. If you met him on the street, you would never guess he's a tycoon. Now, he devotes his energies to popularising yoga, meditation and pranic healing in India and around the world. In fact, before the pandemic brought the world to a standstill, he used to be based in Amsterdam for half the year (the other half, mostly in Delhi), where he has been assiduously promoting yoga and meditation, and where he has a huge and devoted following. At some point in his decades-long spiritual journey\u2014which included interactions with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar of Art of Living as well as the Brahma Kumaris\u2014 Mittal experienced a 'divine connect' with the 'Supreme Being' . You can describe it in many ways, perhaps all inadequate if you've not experienced it yourself: enlightenment, epiphany , ecstasy , seeing the light. But you get the idea. This is what all meditators eventually aspire to. Mittal does not claim to be a guru, only a facilitator on your own spiritual path, there to gently nudge you along.

One of the highlights of the retreat is the pranic healing session, a no-touch therapy that unclogs your chakras and clears your aura. It looks like nothing much, just someone swiping and 'cutting' the air in front of you, but if you keep an open mind the effects can be transformative. Believe it or not, it can also be administered long distance over the telephone. Another According to certain ancient belief systems, the body has seven primary chakras or energy vortexes.

This sort of access is privileged, and it makes the retreat special. Nothing is achieved without teamwork. Mittal's team pours their heart and soul into making the retreat a success. Everything runs like clockwork. There are people to hustle you out of bed should the cold make you reluctant.

The world needs a lot of laughter right now, even if we have to induce it. But at the core of the progamme is meditation. Different stages of the journey call for different kinds. Mittal has devised a method which, if followed in letter and spirit, should make it a breeze. Goals like stress busting, controlling your thoughts, cultivating blankness, seeking peace and even doing it for health reasons fall by the side, the meditation eventually evolving to a contemplation of the universe itself. I won't say it's easy , but if you keep at it, you will reap the rewards. Just trust the process and get with it. Yoga for the soul I can say without exaggeration that, after three nights, I felt transformed. I was suddenly more focussed, more self-aware. I found myself more in the present moment, instead of hurtling towards a future that never comes or regretting a past that is lost in the folds of time. I found I was letting my guard down more often. It was a heady new feeling, one that I found myself embracing readily .

Soul yogis who live in Hoshiarpur or nearby cities are able to go for a round of meditation every Sunday , followed, of course, by a delectable and healthy breakfast. Lucky folks! For me, it's an eight-hour drive so I haven't managed to return yet. So what next? Once Covid is well and truly behind us and things normalise, Mittal's dream is to have Divine Soul Yoga centres in every country in the world. A range of top-notch skincare products is also being launched. This could well be the beginning of a whole new wellness and spirituality movement. Just remember who told you about it first.

I started working with my father and honing my culinary skills on the weekends. I realised that I was missing out on creating new and exciting dishes. One fine day , I decided to upload one of my cooking videos on Facebook and it gained millions of views in just 24 hours. This made me realise how much I loved cooking so I went ahead and officially launched Your Food Lab. The channel in fact brought me out from the lowest phase of my life. With over a billion views, you're an internet sensation today. What has kept you going? The kind of response we have gotten so far on social media has been really overwhelming. I also believe that there's a lot of hard work and time that has gone into it. I make the best use of my art and that is A foodie family, a fondness for cooking and an ardent love for street food, chef Sanjyot Keer reveals all things off the menu When and how did your tryst with food begin? I started cooking at the age of 12. I was inspired by my love for street food, especially those late night cravings for pav bhaji. Wanting to recreate the magic of the pav bhaji vendor made me think of going forward with my cooking career. I always believed my mother had a super power of making people smile with her food and I craved for the same. This journey of making meals for my family and watching them enjoy it was where it all began for me and now I make millions of people smile through my cooking. Walk us through the journey from Masterchef india to Your food Lab. I was offered to be the food producer of MasterChef in 2014 when I had just graduated from college. It was a really interesting and an amazing amalgamation of visuals and videos for me. I worked with many brilliant chefs on the show. I did have a few offers in hand while working Chef Sanjyot Keer's twist to the desiness Which city do you think does the best street food? I'm a true-blue Mumbaikar and have grown up eating pav bhaji. It was, in fact, the first meal I ever cooked. Besides that, I love pani puri and if the debate ever comes to gol gappa or puchka, it'll always be pani puri for the win. I think Kolkata also does it really well. Honestly , you get amazing food all over the country . what has kept me going. Whatever I do is all for the viewers and the fans and of course for the love of cooking. Who has been the biggest culinary inspiration for you? It's not just one person but a lot of people. It's the street food heroes who do an amazing job. They are the biggest inspiration for me. The way they run their business and the way they come up with new recipes is truly inspiring. I dedicate a lot of my success to all the street food vendors out there. \u2014RoShni SUBRaManian pav Bhaji one signature recipe which is very close to my heart is this pav bhaji. i've experimented with a number of fusion dishes SAnjyot kEER'S toP PickS FRom HiS cHAnnEl Butter Chicken this is one of my classics. i have always loved butter chicken. it's all about the taste, flavour and emotion. this recipe is a tried and tested one and is always a hit.inteRVieW eattra Vel meNu 80 loaded with flavourful water, pani puri is perhaps one of the most famous Indian street fooodse a t eat outlook tra Veller 81 outlook tra Veller 81 aWe -inspiring asian Fusion With a millon- dollar vieW as aN ar DeNt faN of the fIrst C\u00c9 LA VI in Hong Kong, I was a bit on the fence about this one, though a part of me was extremely thrilled at this prospect too. As it turns out, they didn't fail to impress me. What is wonderful about the Address Skyview location is that it has its own quirks which make it all the more unique. Chef Howard Ko brings to the table several years of gastronomic experience, an astonishing flair and a renewed novel viewpoint. Many have tried to give a new twist to Asian classics, but only few have managed to accomplish this feat as successfully as Chef Ko. Humble dishes are carried off with intelligence and expertise. Its \u00e0 la carte menu is indulgent, stylish and gutsy . Highlights from the menu include the simple sunchoke coconut soup which is creamy with a hint of sweetness. The miso chickpea hummus, Korean chilli oil and yuzu labneh are lighter than air and, thanks to the seaweed parker rolls, disappear from the table before we know it. Make sure you try the lettuce salad with the ginger sesame dressing or the crispy kale salad with a Thai lime vinaigrette. Whatever you choose, I recommend you pair it with the luxurious Togarashi and garlic French fries with a wasabi aioli. Finally , it is the desserts that take me by surprise with the sticky date pudding emerging as refreshingly delightful. From lacquered bone marrow with teriyaki and smoked vinegar to crispy potato hash okonomiyaki style, C\u00c9 LA VI gives a whole new meaning to Asian-fusion fare, one that makes you wonder why this has never been done before.

To be a GM at Aman is to live and be at home every moment in time. As I live in a tent at Aman-i-Khas, I sleep with my walkie-talkie radio, listening to the sounds of the jungle, sometimes waking up to join the party in escorting the dominant species out of camp. I wake up to the sounds of birds, do yoga to soothe my aging back, and start working at 8am with meetings and guest activities. Post breakfast, it's creative time in which sustainable, organic farming or asset-improvement tasks are undertaken or reviewed. Afternoon is for follow ups and emails. By 3pm it's time for adventure, either off to the jungle or work on sustainability and colleagues' skill development. Evening is for time with guests around the fireplace, dinner at 7.30 and in bed by 10. * What do you like most about your work? The people at Aman make it special and it all starts with Aman empowering local communities. Looking at creativity coming out of every single employee helps the organisation adopt and work towards creating unparalleled experiences. * if you weren't in hospitality, what would you be doing?

Even as their culture wanes, it thrives with the keen attention of this community, who wish only to preserve their slice of life in the state. With the Jews' tenacious history unfurling worldwide, Kerala became a much-needed haven. One Heart. Two Worlds: The Story of the Jews of Kochi is laced with pictures depicting their life, some anecdotes and small informative sections on the religion and its practices, on symbols and instruments. Flipping through the book, one can find many handwritten songs and recipes. For instance, to make curries kosher, coconut milk is poured in so as to not mix dairy and meat. Or how tapioca is used in place of gelatin as a binding agent. There is much to unpack in this The Road to Oxiana by r obert b yron Lambent and carefree in its words, keen in its observation and a masterfully penned down non-fiction from explorer and art historian Robert Byron's pen-The Road to Oxiana, is a delightfully timeless account of Byron's journey to Afghanistan in 1933-34. 'Oxiana' in the title is a reference to the old name of Afghanistan's northern border region. Starting from Venice, Byron's ten-month journey (with Christopher Sykes' initial company) concludes at (now) Pakistan. Written in the form of diary entries, the book entails Byron's observations of the history and architecture, descriptions of individuals he had chance encounters with, all packaged with some strong personal opinion on culture and lifestyle. The purpose of Byron's voyage was a fascination with the region's architectural marvels and he justifies the idea of travelogue writing. His digressions in the book, carve a brutally raw picture of what he actually disapproved of, like the westernisation of Afghanistan, the history of Seljuks and Timurids, etc. Spanning across Venice, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Peshawar, Byron lays out a compelling experiential commentary and leaves the readers with a lingering question. Penguin ClassiCs K475What ha PPens when an Indian Revenue Service officer decides to pursue his passion for travel, writing and photography? The result is an incredible book that will give many travel writers a run for their money . Filled with inspiring stories about East Asia and its deep-rooted linkages with Indian civilisation, Deepankar Aron's latest is a sublime study of how civilisations nurture strong ties with each other in terms of sharing religion, philosophy and culture. As an avid traveller, I have seen my share of Buddhist sights across India and reading Aron's accounts of his sojourn through 98 destinations across East Asia has only lengthened my bucket list. The book introduces the readers to ancient India that has been beautifully preserved in the art, architecture and cultural traditions of China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia. Aron starts with Xinjiang's erstwhile capital Karakhoja and then takes his readers through ancient cities along the Silk Road that connects China with Mongolia. The writer also traverses through Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar from Sichuan in south-western China, followed by Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taipei, Taiwan and Kaohsiung and finally takes us to Luoyang, the birthplace of Chinese Buddhism. The writer also visits a site dedicated to an Indian monk, who is believed to have taken the south Indian martial art of kalaripayattu to China, where it took the shape of kung fu or wushu. Aron's competitive photography deserves a special mention. From breathtakingly magnificent landscapes and imposing temples to rare artefacts and the lovely people he met, he's spoken a lot with the lens. The prime takeaway is that India was much liberal and way too welcoming of other civilisations than the times we live in. The same can also be observed in prominent Vedic scholar Lokesh Chandra's introduction to the book, an engaging read in its own right. At a time when the bilateral bonds between India and China are going through a rough patch (to an extent where we are renaming fruits), the book talks about the special relationship that we've always enjoyed with the dragon. \u2014kaRan kaushik On The TRail Of Buddha by deeP ankar aron niyogi books K1,995 The book introduces ancient india that has been beautifully preserved in the art, architecture and cultural traditions of china, Japan, korea and Mongolia. he starts with Xinjiang's erstwhile capital karakhoja and then takes his readers along the silk Route Quest for Nirvana outlook traveller 89 BOOK revieWS Back This is a unique anthology based on Muslim food culture\u2014perhaps delectable would be the correct word. In the subcontinent, biryani is the food of choice on celebratory occasions, especially in Bengal where a new variant was devised on the exile of Wajid Ali Shah from Awadh to Calcutta. But apart from that Muslim food is noted for its richness and variety of textures, though there is a persistent belief that it is mainly carnivorous and kebab dominated. In her introduction, Chambers talks of Muslim bawarchis as alchemists of a different kind, transmuting ingredients into golden qormas and halwas. Always evocative of emotion, food for Muslims is associated with festivals like Ramadan with its emphasis on fasts and preparations for sehri and iftar before and after, with ceremonies of mourning, weddings, and even coming of age. The Prophet himself laid importance on the ceremonial aspect of food and on disciplined eating. All these come together in this anthology . Chambers gathers together writers from the region, along with food historians and chefs. Desi Delicacies is divided into essays and stories with recipes in both sections. For the Muslim world of South Asia, food and the excellence thereof is a way of judging the rest of the world-you are what you eat, after all. There is food from Bangladesh and Bengal, ilish served with a sauce of mustard Desi Delicacies Edited by Claire Chambers PiCador india K450 paste, the melt in the mouth texture of payesh and kheer-Bengal food is at one level complex and at another very simple. There is a story on how the samosa came to be the perfect accompaniment with chai and how for some like Annie Zaidi, secret recipes are more of a thrill than anything else. However, while the essays are as enriching as the food, the stories bring a note of sadness since a story cannot all be about food, unless it is something like Joanne Harris' Chocolat. Jackfruit with Tamarind, in the story section in fact comes across more as an essay as it puts together the constituents of a Bangladeshi table. Nadeem Aslam's unexpected meeting in a London restaurant as he tastes a dish that only one person could have cooked could in fact have been a story rather than an essay . The dividing lines between the two are thin-the story of The Hairy Curry is an experience that is solely based on food. The vessel for Shab-e-Barat becomes the cusp for an almost ghost story when grandfather descends from heaven on the evening of forgiveness in search of kebabs on earth. As the world is changing and Muslim students find new spaces, there are experiences with pasta and burgers to broaden horizons. Both essays and stories are accompanied by recipes that range from the simple to the complex, allowing readers a chance to recreate the flavours evoked for themselves and tuck the book on kitchen shelves rather than in libraries. Desi Delicacies does have a deeper purpose behind it - to record culinary memories, local food heritage and forgotten grains that are being rediscovered in villages in India and will surely spread to Pakistan and Bangladesh. It is also an attempt to write down the oral histories of food cultures which would otherwise soon be lost by putting them between the covers of recipe books and perpetuating traditions of memory and deliciousness. \u2014anJana Basualways evocative of emotion, food for Muslims is associated with festivals like Ramadan with its emphasis on fasts and preparations for sehri and iftar before and after, with ceremonies of mourning, weddings, and even coming of ageFebruary 2021 90Time Traveller Back India's national carrier has always shared a rather colourful relationship with art.
