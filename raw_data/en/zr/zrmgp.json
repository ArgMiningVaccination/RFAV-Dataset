Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, sent a letter to Defense Health Agency Director Lieutenant General Ronald Place requesting detailed information about claims filed on Tricare, a military healthcare program, for active duty service members related to COVID-19 and potential COVID-19 vaccine injuries. \"Although the Biden Administration's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for the military will end with the signing of the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, my efforts to uncover and expose the vaccines' harmful effect on our service members will continue.

Sen. Johnson has heard from many whistleblowers \u2014 including [service members](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/2022/8/sen-johnson-to-dod-fda-cdc-whistleblower-allegations-about-covid-19-vaccine-mislabeling-and-unauthorized-manufacturing-must-be-fully-addressed) \u2014 raising concerns about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. He has led multiple [roundtables](https://www.ronjohnson.senate.gov/covid) addressing pandemic response failures and has written over 45 public letters to federal health agencies demanding transparency about the COVID-19 vaccines. Last week, Sen. Johnson [offered](https://rumble.com/v20urlu-senator-johnson-on-senate-floor-12.15.html) an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have provided additional protections for service members who were negatively impacted by the Department of Defense's pointless and harmful COVID-19 vaccine policy. Sen. Johnson requested Lt. Gen. Place respond to his letter no later than January 9, 2023.

Place Director Defense Health Agency Dear Lt. Gen. Place: Over the last year, I have heard from countless individuals across the country who have suffered life-altering injuries after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. My office has also been in contact with many men and woman of the U.S. military who have shared their concerns about the Department of Defense's (DoD) pointless and harmful COVID-19 vaccine policy. In an effort to inform the public of the potential harm caused by these vaccines, I held three roundtables on this topic and have sent multiple letters to federal health agencies\u2014including DoD\u2014requesting information on vaccine safety and efficacy. [[1]](#_ftn1) Unfortunately, despite the unprecedented number of adverse events and deaths associated with the COVID-19 vaccines on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, this administration has failed to provide full and transparent information on vaccine safety to Congress and to the public. Although the Biden Administration's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for the military will end with the signing of the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, my efforts to uncover and expose the vaccines' harmful effect on our service members will continue.
