COVID RISK CALCULATOR: Find out your risk of catching Covid: [https://corical.immunisationcoalition.org.au/](https://corical.immunisationcoalition.org.au/) A Public Health England study found in May that two doses of AstraZeneca OR Pfizer were 66 - 88% effective against the Indian coronavirus strain, or variant B617. AstraZeneca can be given to anyone with: - People with a past history of venous thromboembolism in typical sites, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism - People with a predisposition to form blood clots, such as those with Factor V Leiden, or other non-immune thrombophilic disorders - People with a family history of clots or clotting conditions - People currently receiving anticoagulant medications - People with a history of ischaemic heart disease or cerebrovascular accident - People with a current or past history of thrombocytopenia. Pfizer is preferred for anyone with: - A past history of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) - A past history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) - A past history of and splenic) and water for injections. COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca does not contain any preservatives and the vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex. PFIZER VACCINE CONTAINS: - - Monobasic potassium phosphate - Sodium chloridE - Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate - CONTRA INDICATIONS FOR PFIZER VACCINE: - People with a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine should not take it. - Any cardiomyopathy, heart failure, inflammatory heart condition - There are currently no efficacy or safety data for children below the age of 12 years. Until such data are available, individuals below 12 years of age should not be routinely vaccinated. MODERNA (SPIKEVAX) mRNA VACCINE CONTENTS: The active ingredient is the mRNA embedded in the SM-102 lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Other ingredients include: - Heptadecan-9-yl 8-[2-hydroxyethyl-(6-oxo-6-undecoxyhexyl)amino]octanoate - bullet Cholesterol (enhances membrane fluidity) - Distearoylphosphatidylcholine - bullet 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 - bullet Trometamol - Trometamol hydrochloride - Acetic acid - Sodium acetate trihydrate - Sucrose (sugar) The Moderna (SPIKEVAX) COVID-19 vaccine is produced using a cell-free vitro transcription process and does not include preservatives or any components of animal or human origin. Moderna (SPIKEVAX) COVID-19 vaccine contains less than 1mmol (23mg) of sodium per 0.5mL dose and is therefore essentially 'sodium-free' (Moderna Australia, 2021). Protection against the Delta variant A test-negative case-control study in Canada was conducted with more than 400,000 symptomatic cases and showed that effectiveness against PCR-positive symptomatic disease 21 days after dose 1 was 70% (95% CI: 52 - 81) for Delta variant cases compared to 84% (95% CI: 80 - 86) for Alpha variant cases. Effectiveness against hospitalisation or death 21 days after dose 1 was 95% (95% CI: 67 - 99) for Delta variant cases compared to 80% (95% CI:74 - 85) for Alpha variant cases (ATAGI, 2021b). ATAGI is aware of scientific reports proposing that inadvertent injection of a COVID-19 vaccine into a blood vessel may be a contributing cause of serious adverse events following immunisation, such as myocarditis. ATAGI has reviewed the available evidence and considers injection technique highly unlikely to be a contributor to these adverse events, for several reasons: - The majority of myocarditis cases occur after the second dose of the mRNA vaccines. If intravascular injection was an important contributor, there would not be this differential distribution of cases by vaccine dose. - Direct injection into a blood vessel is unlikely in recommended injection sites. - Based on a review of the available evidence, ATAGI does not recommend routinely aspirating (drawing back) needles before injection. This practice was rejected some decades ago, due to several disadvantages including prolonging the procedure, potentially associated pain, and increasing the risk of needle-syringe disconnection. Not aspirating is supported by the current advice in the Australian Immunisation Handbook (ATAGI, 2018). Contraindications include anaphylaxis or a severe hypersensitivity reaction to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine including Moderna (SPIKEVAX) COVID-19 vaccine. Anaphylaxis to any of its contained components as listed in Topic 1 (Moderna Australia, 2021). A risk of myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed in people who have received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines such as Moderna (SPIKEVAX) COVID-19 vaccine in overseas studies, particularly in males under 30 years of age after the second vaccine dose . Symptoms typically appear within 1-5 days of vaccination and include chest pain, palpitations (irregular heartbeat), syncope (fainting) or shortness of breath. Past infection with SARS-CoV-2 is not a contraindication to vaccination. Vaccination can be deferred for up to six months after the acute illness in those who have had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence suggests that past infection reduces the risk of reinfection for at least 6 months.Pregnancy - mRNA COVID-19 vaccines such as Moderna (SPIKEVAX) are recommended for pregnant women (ATAGI, 2021b). This is because the risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 is significantly higher for pregnant women and their unborn baby, than non-pregnant women.Breastfeeding - It is not known if Moderna (SPIKEVAX) is excreted in human breast milk (Moderna Australia, 2021). Women do not need to stop breastfeeding before or after vaccination.Fertility - Getting vaccinated before conceiving can provide protection for women against COVID-19 throughout their pregnancy. Vaccination does not affect fertility. Women are not required to have a pregnancy test before getting vaccinated (ATAGI, 2021j).Very common adverse events - The following list identifies the frequency of very common AEFI in completed phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials: - Site pain - >92% of individuals. - Fatigue - >70% of individuals. - Headache - >64% of individuals. - Myalgia - >61% of individuals. - Arthralgia - >46% of individuals. - Chills - >45% of individuals. - Nausea and vomiting - >23% of individuals. - Axillary swelling/tenderness - >19% of individuals. - Fever - >15% of individuals. - Injection site swelling - >14% of individuals. - Redness at the injection site - >10% of individuals. Other AEFI to be aware of include: - Delayed injection site reactions (>7 days after vaccination) including pain, erythema and swelling (common). - Injection site urticaria (hives) (common). - Injection site pruritus (itchiness) (uncommon). - Lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis/lymph node pain/axillary mass (uncommon). - Facial swelling in people who had a history of dermatological fillers phosphate monohydrate Polysorbate 80 Sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) Hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) Very common side effects Tenderness or pain at injection site Feeling tired Feeling unwell Headache Muscle aches Joint pain Nausea Vomiting Common side effects Redness at injection site Swelling at injection site Fever (temperature higher than 38\u00b0C) Chills Pain or discomfort in the arms, hands, legs and/or feet - "}
