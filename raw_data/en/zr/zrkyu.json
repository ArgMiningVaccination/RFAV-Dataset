A multidisciplinary team of professionals offers a full range of therapeutic approaches to help you achieve optimal health and healing. These include herbs, acupuncture, massage, yoga, meditation, and health and wellness coaching. In many situations, integrative therapies are used with conventional medicine approaches. Functional medicine consultation During a functional medicine consultation, you talk with a health care provider trained in integrative medicine and health. Together, you and your provider address the underlying causes of disease and promote optimal well-being. Your treatment plan may include one or more of the integrative practices available. Bring to this appointment a list of supplements and medications that you take, including doses. Your health care provider may recommend: - Acupuncture - Dietary supplements and botanicals - Exercise, activity or mindful movement, such as yoga or tai chi - Health and wellness coaching - Massage therapy - Mind-body counseling - Nutritional consultation - Stress management Acupuncture Acupuncture Acupuncture is one of the world's oldest recognized medical therapies. It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine and embraced by many people, including those who practice conventional medicine, as a safe and effective treatment for many conditions. You are treated by a doctor trained in acupuncture or a licensed acupuncture practitioner supervised by a doctor. Mayo Clinic acupuncture specialists enterprisewide perform more than 1,400 acupuncture treatments each year. Techniques include acupuncture with manual and electrical stimulation, acupressure, and cupping. Treatments are tailored to your needs, concerns and diagnosis. Mayo Clinic treatment rooms dedicated to acupuncture have soft music and gentle lighting to help you relax while your practitioner places the needles. A typical acupuncture visit is 45 to 60 minutes. Dietary supplements and botanicals Botanicals and supplements are marketed and taken like medications but regulated like foods. They can interact with medications and each other, resulting in side effects or suboptimal treatment. During a botanicals and supplements consultation, you talk with a pharmacist who is an expert on these popular products and learn about how their potential risks and side effects might affect your health and well-being. Massage therapy Massage therapy Massage therapy may be offered on an outpatient basis or to people who are admitted to the hospital. Mayo researchers have found that this integrative medicine practice can reduce pain, anxiety and tension in people facing or recovering heart surgery, breast cancer, colon surgery and other procedures. Mayo Clinic massage therapists provide massage therapy to thousands of people each year. Mayo Clinic's massage therapists have sought additional training in techniques such as acupressure, reflexology, mobilization of scar tissue and lymphedema drainage. A certified massage therapist works with you and uses techniques based on your needs and goals. Mind-body counseling Meditation Mind-body techniques can help promote physical, mental and spiritual wellness. Mind-body counseling offers individual and group sessions that enhance the mind-body connection. Sessions involve a variety of therapeutic techniques and may include mindfulness, stress management, resiliency training, yoga, mindful movements and gratitude exercises. Mind-body medicine looks to address the physical, mental and spiritual factors that affect personal health. Health and wellness coaching Health and wellness coaching is a person-centered partnership between a coach and you. Coaches use evidence-based approaches to engage in conversations and create connections that foster behavioral and process changes through motivation and a sense of ownership. The aim is to promote your ability to make changes and to nurture personal accountability. Ultimately coaches help empower you to make a commitment to your health care needs and well-being by living your best envisioned life. Health and wellness coaching is neither therapy nor counseling. It's an approach that centers on motivating people to become the leading drivers, critical thinkers and choice makers to fulfill their vision of personal health and well-being.
