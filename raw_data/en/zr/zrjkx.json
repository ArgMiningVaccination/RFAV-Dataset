METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional survey method was used in this study. A total of 324 cases withHB-ACLFinChinawereinvolved. RESULTS: The general frequency of TCM patterns in HB-ACLF were as follows: (26/324, 8.02%). In the early stageofHB-ACLF,therewasaremarkablyhigherpercent-age of excessive patterns than those in the middleand late stage.The incidence of HeatToxin Stagna-tion reached the (36/106) in the middle stageand 20.51% (16/78) in the late stage. In the earlystage of HB-ACLF, excessive patterns, such as theHeat Toxin Stagnation Pattern, were more preva-lentthanthoseinthemiddleandlatestages(P<=0.003). However, in the late stage of HB-ACLF, defi-cient patterns, such as the Yang QiDeficiency Pat- tern, were more prevalent than those in the earlyand middle stages. The Yang QiDeficiency Pattern had a higher rate of 41.03% (32/78) in the latestagecomparedwiththatof20.75%(22/106)inthemiddle stage and 8.57% (12/140, P<=0.003) in the early stage. The distribution of the other pat-terns was not significant between the three stages(P>0.003). CONCLUSIONS: There are four major patterns of HB-ACLF, including the Heat Toxin Stagnation Pat- tern, the Damp-heat Obstruction Pattern, the Yang QiDeficiency Pattern, and the Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency Pattern. The Heat Toxin Stagnation andYang QiDeficiency Patterns are the representative patterns in the early and late stages of HB-ACLF. InthemiddlestageofHB-ACLF,theTCMpatternsvaryin a complicated manner, with no significant differ-ence among the patterns. Treatment for HB-ACLFshould vary with the different representative pat-ternsintheearlyandlatestages. \u00a92012JTCM.Allrightsreserved.

ACLF develops from chronic liver diseases un-der acute occasions, manifesting as jaundice and distur-bance of blood coagulation, with complications of encephalopathy within have liver-related complications and most ofthem die of multiple organ dysfunction. Approximate-ly 75% of untreated ACLF patients die, 2and therefore it is an acute and severe disease. The three main causesof ACLF are hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection(90.29%), alcoholic liver disease (2.65%), and superin-fection of HBV and hepatitis E virus (HEV) (2.26%). 3 An epidemiological study on TCM patterns of hepati-tis B-related (HB)-ACLF in different stages would beuseful for classification and treatment, as well as basicdata for establishment of national medicare policies. Inrecent years, there has been little research onTCM pat-terns of chronic severe hepatitis, of which diagnosticcriteria were determined at the 10th National ViralHepatitis Conference in 2000, Xi'an. None of these di-agnostic criteria are on the basis of the diagnostic stan-dard given in the Guideline of Diagnosis and Treat-ment of Liver Failure in 2006.We collected data on 324 HB-ACLF inpatients of theSichuan Region and determined the distribution of theTCM patterns for HB-ACLF in different stages toguide clinical prescriptions and treatments. METHODS PatientsThis prospective, cross-sectional survey was conductedusing data of 324 inpatients who were admitted to theAffiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of ChineseMedicine from September2007 to October 2009.This study was approved by the appropriate ethics com-mittees and was performed in accordance with the ethi-cal standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.All persons signed their informed consent prior to theirinclusion in the study. Diagnosticstandard According to the Guideline for the Diagnosis andTreat-ment of Liver Failure 4formulated in 2006 by the Chi- nese Academic Association of Infectious Diseases andthe Chinese Academic Association of Liver Diseases,ACLF is a rapid and acute liver disease based on chron-ic liver disease, and is divided into three stages. In theearly stage, symptoms are as follows: 1) extreme fatiguewith severe digestive symptoms, such as obvious vomiting, distention; 2) aggres-sive jaundice (serum bilirubin 171 mol/L or a daily increase by 17.1 mol/L); 3) a trend of hemorrhage, with 30% <prothrombin activity (PTA) 40%; and 4)no symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy or obvious as-cites. In the middle stage, patients either have liver en-cephalopathy below the second degree and (or) obvi-ous ascites, or an obvious trend of suggillation), with 20% <PTA 30%. Inthe late stage, patients become worse with any one ofthe following conditions: 1) intractable complications,such as hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encepha-lopathy a severe hemorrhage (petechiae in the injection position),with PTA 20%. Exclusioncriteria Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) acute liver failure,sub-acute liver failure, and chronic liver failure; 2)non-HBV-infection related ACLF; 3) pregnant or lac-tating women; 4) patients with primary liver cancer; 5)patients with other serious systemic or psychiatric dis-eases; 6) patients younger than 18 years or older than65 years. Inclusioncriteria Inclusion criteria were 1) inpatients in accordance with the above-mentioned diagnostic criteria; 2) patientswithout any one item of exclusion criteria; 3) patientswho coordinated with doctors; 4) patients who had thenecessary clinical examinations. Collectionofpatient'sdata Every patient was examined by two trained researchers and their information was analyzed with a prospective,cross-sectional survey method. The valid informationcollection period was within 24 h from patients' confir-mation of HB-ACLF. If the two researchers disagreedabout the TCM syndrome differentiation, the case wasexcluded from the study. CriteriaofTCMdifferentiationanddiagnosis The criteria of TCM differentiation and diagnosis ref-fered to the TCM Differentiation Criteria on Viral Hepatitis Draft 5formulated by the Chinese TCM Aca- demic Association of Hepatic Diseases, the Guidelinesfor Clinical Research on Chinese New Herbal Treat-ment on viral hepatitis formulated by the Sino-Foodand Drug Administration 6, and other sources.7 HeatToxin Stagnation Pattern: Major symptoms of theHeat Toxin Stagnation Pattern were as follows: 1) yel-low and normal urine; 2) skin itching, bleeding pointafter scratching, or a burning sensation; 3) purple anddark tongue with suggillation, and an enlarged and pro-longed sublingual vein.

TypingofHBVGenotypes/subgenotypes Genotyping was based assay described. 8The entire amplified were directly sequenced. HBV gen-otypes and subgenotypes were determined by molecu-lar evolutionary of the viral sequences usingMEGA 4 software (www.megasoftware.net). Phyloge-netic trees were constructed using neighbor-joininganalysis with bootstrap test confirmation performed on1000 resamplings. Standard reference sequences wereacquired from the online Hepatitis Virus Database(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genotyping/formpage.cgi) as previously reported. 9 ResearchflowchartA flow chart of the research is shown in Figure 1. Statisticsanalysis We analyzed the data with SPSS 17.0 (Cabit Informa-tion Technology Co, Ltd). The trial used R\u00d7C test sta-tistical methods, and P<0.01 indicated the distribution of the TCM patterns in the different stages showed asignificant difference. The Bonferroni method wasused to adjust for multiple comparisons, which was P< '=2/k(k-1)=0.003,forcomparisonamongthegroups,and this showed whether there was a significant differ-ence of the constituent ratio of the TCM patterns inthe different stages. RESULTS ClinicaldataAmong the 324 HB-ACLF inpatients studied fromSeptember 2007 to October 2009, 236 were male pa-tients (72.84%) and 88 were female patients (27.16%),aged 19-65 years [(44\u00b19) years old]. There were 140,106, and 78 cases in the early, middle and late stages,respectively. Baselineinformation The patients' basic information, laboratory informa-tion, and complications are shown inTable 1. TheRelationshipbetweenTCMpatternsand clinicalstagesinHB-ACLFcases The distribution of TCM patterns in the 324HB-ACLF cases were as follows. In the early stage ofHB-ACLF, the main patterns were the HeatToxin and Kid-neyYinDeficiency Pattern (8/140, 5.71% ). In the middle stage, the main patterns were the Heat ToxinStagnation Pattern (36/106, 33.96%), the Damp-heatObstruction Pattern (20/106, 18.87%), and the Liverand Kidney YinDeficiency Pattern (12/106, 11.32%). In the late stage, the main patterns were the Yang Qi Deficiency Pattern (32/78, 41.03%), the Heat ToxinStagnation Pattern patterns were processed into binomial informa-tion (positive and negative) with the R\u00d7C test. TheHeat Toxin Stagnation Pattern and Yang QiDeficiency Pattern had a significant difference in the distributionof different stages, that is, the Heat Toxin StagnationandYang QiDeficiency Patterns were the representa- tive patterns in the early and late stages of HB-ACLF.However, the other patterns, including Damp-heat Ob-struction, Liver and Kidney YinDeficiency, Liver De- pression and Spleen Deficiency, Dampness Obstruct-ing the Spleen and Stomach, Stasis-heat and PhlegmObstruction, and Liver Depression with QiStagnation, did not show any significant differences in the distribu-tion of different stages (P>0.05,Table 2).The incidence of the Heat Toxin Stagnation Pattern inthe early stage was much higher than that in the mid-dle and later stages ( P<=0.003, Table 3). The inci- dence of the Yang QiDeficiency Pattern was higher in the late stage than that in the early and middle stages.(P<=0.003,Table 4).

Liver failure is a syndromewith characteristics of hepatic encephalopathy and co-agulation disturbance caused by acute hepatocyte ne-crosis or progressive liver function impairment. In2000, the 10th National Viral Hepatitis Conference in Xi'an, China changed the diagnostic criteria of severehepatitis 10and confirmed the diagnostic criteria of he- patic failure. In 2005, the American Association for the Study of Liver Failure issued the Management of Acute Liver Failure.11In 2006, the Liver Failure and Artificial Liver Group of the Chinese Society of Infectious Dis-eases and the Severe Liver Diseases and Artificial LiverTable 3 Distribution of the Heat-toxin Stagnation Pattern compared with late stage.Table 4 Distribution of the YangQiDeficiency Pattern in the threestagesofHB-ACLF Stage Late MiddleEarlyTotalPositive 32221244Negative (10.2) 107 (33.0) 54 (1.5) Table2TCMpatternsof324HB-ACLFcases Pattern HeatToxin Stagnation Damp-heat ObstructionYang QiDeficiency Spleen failing to Control Blood Turbid Dampness Overflowing YinandYangSeparation and CollapseLiver and Kidney Yin DeficiencyLiver Depression and Spleen Deficiency Dampness Obsructing the Spleen and Stomach Stasis-heat and Phlegm Obstruction Liver Depression and Qi Stgnation TotalStage (n, %) Early 82 2212 of the Chinese Medical Association issued the first Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for LiverFailure. 4In 2009, the APASAL conference issued the Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure Consensus and Discus-sion Draft, which differentiated ACLF from chronicliver failure (CLF). The Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure Consensus and Discussion Draft defined ACLF' s diag-nostic criteria from a functional aspect and discusseddetails regarding ACLF (for example, definition, cause,pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, dif-ferential diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment). The is-sued guidelines and consensus mentioned above re-markably improved the understanding, diagnosis, andtreatment of ACLF.Most scholars believe that chronic severe hepatitis dis-cussed in the 10th National Viral Hepatitis Conferencein2000,Xi'anincludesACLFandCLFwhichweredis-cussed in the Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment ofLiverFailurein2006.However,CLFischronicliverde-compensation on the basis of cirrhosis accompanied byascites or portal hypertension, dysfunction of coagula-tion,andhepaticencephalopathy. 12ACLFandCLFhave remarkable differences in results of laboratory peritonitis,infection, and mortality. 13-14In summary, the clinical manifestations, treatment, and prognosis of ACLF andCLFhavesignificantdifferencesandshouldbedifferenti-ated, which also applies in the study of TCM patterns.The differentiation for ACLF and CLF applies not onlyfor conception, but also for treatment and prognosis ac-cording to differentiation.Recent studies on the TCM patterns in China havemainly focused on chronic severe hepatitis which werediscussed in the 2000 Xi'an Conference. It is impor-tant to determine the distribution of TCM patterns forHB-ACLF because the Guideline of the Diagnosis andTreatment of Liver Failure confirmed new diagnosticcriteria of ACLF and CLF.Our study showed that the excessive patterns com- prised the major part of the early stage of HB-ACLF, (e.g., Heat Toxin Stagnation Pattern, Damp-heat Ob-struction Pattern, Yang QiDeficiency Pattern, and Liv- er and Kidney YinDeficiency Pattern). In the late stage of HB-ACLF, the deficient patterns comprised thegreatest proportion (e.g., Yang QiDeficiency Pattern, Heat Toxin Stagnation Pattern, Damp-heat Obstruc-tion Pattern, and Liver and Kidney YinDeficiency Pat- tern). In the middle stage, distribution of TCM pat-terns for HB-ACLF were prone to an intermediatestate of excessive and deficient patterns with the HeatToxin Stagnation Pattern, the Damp-heat ObstructionPattern, the Yang QiDeficiency Pattern, and the Liver and Kidney YinDeficiency Pattern. The general fre- quency of TCM patterns in HB-ACLF can be present-ed as follows: Heat Stagnation Pattern (134/324,41.36% ), Damp-heat Pattern (66/324,20.37% ), Yang Qi Deficiency 16.05%) and Liver and Kidney YinDeficiency Pattern (26/324, 8.02%). Our results indicated that the TCMpatterns in HB-ACLF transformed in each stage. The Heat Toxin Stagnation Pattern was the representativepattern in the early stage, and it was significantly moreprevalent than that in the middle and late stages. TheYang QiDeficiency Pattern was the representative pat- tern in the late stage, and it was significantly more prev-alent than that in the early and middle stages. Otherpatterns, including Damp-heat Obstruction, Liver andKidneyYinDeficiency, Liver Depression and Spleen Deficiency, Dampness Obstructing the Spleen andStomach, Stasis-heat and Phlegm Obstruction, and Liv-er Depression with QiStagnation were not significant- ly different among the early, middle and late stages ofHB-ACLF.HB-ACLF has different immunological backgroundsin different stages according to modern medicine. Inthe early stage of HB-ACLF, the immune system induc-es massive and submassive necrosis of liver cellsas a re-sult of immune hyperfunction. 15Studies indicate that clearing therapy of TCM can decrease the mortality ofHB-ACLF in the early stage by eliminating immunecomplexes and endotoxin, inhibiting inflammation,promoting regeneration, and ameliorating symptomsas a result of suppression of immune hyperfunction. 16 In the late stage of HB-ACLF, immune hypofunctiondevelops, with significantly less total lymphocytes,CD4 +, CD8+T cells, and NK cells compared with those in the early stage. Therefore, the lymphocyte subset isan effective marker to predict the prognosis ofHB-ACLF patients. HB-ACLF death cases were moreconcentrated in the late stage with much less total lym-phocytes, CD4 +, CD8+T cells, and NK cells than those in cases that survive ( P<0.05), which demon- strates that a inperipheralbloodmaybethedrivingfactorfordeteriora-tion of HB-ACLF. 17TCM-supplementing therapy less- ens the mortality of HB-ACLF in the late stage byblocking inflammation reactions, improving hepato-cyte regeneration, and reducing secondary infection. 18,19 Treatment for HB-ACLF should vary with differentrepresentative patterns in the early and late stages, byclearing and reducing internal heat in the early stage,and warming and supplementing organs in the late stage. In the middle stage of HB-ACLF, a combinationof clearing and warming should be applied according toourresultsofnotfindinganyrepresentativepatterns.Our results showed that in different stages ofHB-ACLF, the distribution of the TCM patterns re-markably varied. HB-ACLF stages can proclaim upsand downs of not only pathogens but also anti-patho-genicQi. In the early stage of HB-ACLF, the pathogen and anti-pathogenic Qiare both strong and excessive. In the middle stage, deficiency and excess are mixed. In 543JTCM|www.journaltcm.com December15,2012 |volume32 |Issue4|HuXYetal.DistributionofTCMpatternsinhepatitisB-relatedacute-on-chronicliverfailure the late stage, anti-pathogenic Qiand the pathogen are both weak, altering the disease from excessive to defi- cient with various complications. This transformationcorresponds with general TCM understanding of achange in disease, for which different measures shouldbe taken in each stage as follows: reducing the excess and strengthening the deficiency are important in theearly stage and the late stage, respectively, while in themiddle stage, the combination of relieving andstrengthening should be applied according to patterndifferentiation.Our study provides new ideas for clinical strategies. Forexample, regular treatment for HB-ACLF patients inthe early and late stage could be administered by add-ing and subtracting components of a root prescriptionaccording to TCM patterns. However, in the middlestage, there is no representative pattern, and thereforeconfirming a root prescription would be difficult, aswell as adding and subtracting components of a root.Attention should be paid to designing a flexible thera-py according to pattern differentiation to decrease mor-tality and increase curative effects.
