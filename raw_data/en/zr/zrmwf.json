Methods Design The s elf-controlled case series (SCCS) method adapted to evaluate death as the outcome was used .1,2 The SCCS method, originally developed to assess vaccine safety, utilizes within -person comparisons to estimate the temporal association between a transient exposure and an acute event.1 The SCCS method estimates relative incidence (RI) by comparing incidence during a defined high -risk period following exposure with incid ence during a control period (i.e., all time in the follow -up period that is not the risk period) .1-4 A major strength of the SCCS method is that fixed -time confounders , such as health related risk-factors, are controlled for .1,3 The primary analysis utilized the SCCS method developed for single exposures that cannot be repeated .1,3,4 Since mRNA vaccination s require a multidose schedule, a simple modification was employed , where the last vaccination preceding death was used as the single exposure .2 In this method, the within -individual comparison is between the immediate post -exposure period and later post - exposure periods.3 Data sources Data from Florida's reportable disease repository (Merlin), Florida State Health Online Tracking System (FLSHOTS), and death records data from vital statistics were linked. Setting and study p opulation For the primary analysis, Florida residents aged 1 8 years or older who died within 25-weeks of COVID -19 vaccinati on since the start of the vaccination roll -out (December 15, 2020) were included. Individuals were excluded if they (1) had a documented COVID -19 infection , (2) experienced a COVID -19 associated death , (3) received a booster , or (4) received their la st COVID -19 vaccination after December 8, 2021 (to ensure each individual had the 25-week follow -up period to experience the event of interest ). To allow for death registration , the study end date for both analyses was June 1, 2022. Exposure and outcomes The exposure of interest was the 28 -day risk period following COVID -19 vaccination. Two outcomes were assessed. Natural all -cause deaths (i.e., excluding homicides, suicides, and accidents) and cardiac -related deaths . Cardiac -related deaths were included if their death record contained an ICD -10 code of I30 -I52. For the primary analysis, o nly participants that experienced the exposure and outcome w ere included in this study. Statistical analysis Primary Analyses Follow -up began on the day of their last COVID -19 vaccination. Participants were not censored upon death, rather, they were followed for the entire 25-week follow -up period.1-4 Conditional logi stic regression model s offsetting by interval -length were used to estimate RI s and 95% confidence inter vals (CIs) comparing incidence in the 28-day risk period to incidence in the baseline period (i.e., the rest of the follow -up period ).2,5 Seasonality was controlled for in each model unless the sample size was too small. Potential confounding by age was reduced by limiting the follow -up period to 25-weeks. Separate models were fitted for each outcome and subgroup analyzed. Estimates were considered statistically significant if the 95% CI did not contain 1. Data were form atted into a stacked dataset, where exposures for each individual are stacked in columns (i.e., multiple rows per individual), using the SCCS package in R. Conditional logistic regression models were estimated using the clogit function from the survival p ackage. Results Primary Analysis Table 1 presents the results for the primary analysis for natural all -cause and cardiac -related deaths following COVID -19 vaccin ation . All-cause deaths following vaccination In the 28 days following vaccination, n o increase in risk was observed for all -cause deaths. A statistically significant decrease was observed for participants 60 years or older in the 28 days following vaccination (RI = 0.97 , 95% CI = 0.94 - 0.99). Cardiac -related deaths following vaccination In the 28 days following vaccination , a statistically significant increase in cardiac -related deaths was detected for the entire study pop ulation (RI = 1.07 , 95% CI = 1.03 - 1.12) . Stratifying by age group revealed RIs were significantly higher for age groups 25 - 39 (RI = 2.16 , 95% CI = 1.35 - 3.47) and 60 or older (RI = 1.05 , 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.10). The remaining age groups failed to reach statistical significance. Cardiac -related deaths by age group, vaccination type, and sex following vaccination To determine which group may be driving the increased risk of cardiac -related deaths in the primary analysis, the vaccination analy sis was further stratified by sex, vaccination type, and age groups. Tables 2 and 3 present the sex specific results for cardiac -related deaths following vaccination stratified by age group and vaccination type. Risk was significantly higher during the risk period for males ( RI = 1.09 , 95% CI = 1.03 - 1.15) but not for females (RI = 1.05 , 95% CI = 0.98 - 1.11). Concerning vaccination type, males receiving mRNA vaccination had significantly higher risk (RI = 1.11 , 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.18), while males receiving vaccinations that were not mRNA/unknown had significantly lower risk (RI = 0.75 , 95% CI = 0.58 - 0.98). RIs for females stratified by vaccination type revealed a similar pattern, with lower, non - significant est imates. Among the subgroups evaluated, males aged 18 - 39 had the highest risk (RI = 1.97 , 95% CI = 1.16 - 3.35). Discussion/ Conclusion In this statewide study of vaccinated Florida residents aged 18 years or older, COVID -vaccination was not associated with an elevated risk for all -cause mortality. COVID -19 vaccination was associated with a modestly increased risk for cardiac -relate d mortality 28 days following vaccination . Results from the stratified analysis for cardiac -related death following vaccination suggests mRNA vaccination may be driving the increased risk in males, especially among males aged 18 - 39. Risk for both all -cause a nd cardiac -related deaths was substantially higher 28 days following COVID -19 infection. The risk associated with mRNA vaccination should be weighed against the risk associated with COVID -19 infection. Limitations These data are preliminary, based on sur veillance data , and should be interpreted with caution. The results have several limitations : While this method has been used to assess risk of death following COVID -19 vaccination,2 it violates the assumption that an event does not affect subsequent exposure (for mRNA vaccines), which may introduce bias .6 Further, it does not consider the multidose vaccination schedule required for mRNA vaccination. This st udy cannot determine the causative nature of a participant's death. We used death certificate data and not medical records. COVID testing status was unknown for those who did not die of/with COVID. Cardiac -related deaths were ascertained if an ACME code of I3-I52 were on their death certificate , thus, the underlying cause of death may not be cardiac -related. The finding that the Janssen vaccine was more protective than mRNA vaccine against mortality within 28 days of vaccination could be due to confounding and needs to be further evaluated. It is likely that the populations who received COVID -19 mRNA vaccine and the Johnson vaccine are different, something we were not able to ascertain in this analysis. It is possible that the population who received the Jo hnson vaccine was younger and healthier than those receiving the mRNA vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines were released more than 2 months earlier than the Janssen vaccine when the recommendations were limited to those 65 and older. Additional studies should be conducted to further understand the risks and benefits of vaccination of males between 25 -39. Increased risk in the primary analysis for the 25 - 39 age group was based on a small sample size. Additionally, significant mortality from dia gnosed COVID -19 infection occurred among all adult age groups. COVID -19 mortality among asymptomatic or undiagnosed COVID -19 infection is less clear. However, excess overall mortality among 25 -44-year -old Americans was significant in a study1 looking at m ortality from January 2020 -October 2020. The largest increases were among Hispanic and Latino. It is unclear what the contribution of asymptomatic or undiagnosed COVID -19 infection is to mortality risk, and how this contributes to excess mortality. 1 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm Confounding by age may be present in the 60 years or older age group, which may explain the slight elevated risk for cardiac -related deaths following vaccination. This may also explain the increased risk for the entire vaccination analysis group for cardia c-related deaths since this group comprises the vast majority of deaths. Removing those aged 60 years or older yielded non -significant results for cardiac - related deaths following vaccination (RI = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.99 - 1.34), mRNA vaccination (RI = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00 - 1.37), and males with mRNA vaccination (RI = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.89 - 1.34). Lastly, this analysis was conducted during the first months the vaccines were available. Both COVID -19 mortality due to infection or risk of mortality associated wit h vaccination have likely changed over time. In the fall of 2022, most people have either been vaccinated or have natural immunity to COVID -19. Many have had multiple vaccine doses, multiple infections or both. Research to assess the current risks and bene fits of the COVID -19 vaccine to help update vaccine recommendations should be studied in this context.
