Raleigh, Claudia Accetturo, and Marco Pravetoni Departments of Pharmacology (M.D.R., M.P.) and Medicine (M.P.), Center for Immunology of Minnesota, Minnesota; di Milano, Socrates Program, Milano, and Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, Minneapolis, Minnesota (M.P.) Received March 18, 2020; accepted June 18, 2020 ABSTRACT Opioid use disorders (OUDs) and opioid-related fatal overdoses are a significant public health concern in the United States andworldwide. To offer more effective medical interventions to treator prevent OUD, antiopioid vaccines are in development that reduce the distribution of the targeted opioids to brain and subsequently reduce the associated behavioral and toxiceffects. It is of critical importance that antiopioid vaccines donot interfere with medications that treat OUD. Hence, this study tested the preclinical proof of concept of combining a candidate oxycodone vaccine in rats. The effects of XR-NTX on oxycodone-induced motor activity and antinociception were first assessed in nonvaccinated na\u00efve rats to establish a baseline forsubsequent studies. Next, OXY-KLH and XR-NTX were coad- ministered to determine whether the combination would affect the efficacy of each individual treatment, and it was found thatthe combination of OXY-KLH and XR-NTX offered greaterefficacy in reducing oxycodone-induced motor activity, thigmo- taxis, antinociception, and respiratory depression over a range of repeated or escalating oxycodone doses in rats. These datasupport the feasibility of combining antibody-based therapieswith opioid receptor antagonists to provide greater or prolongedprotection opioid-related toxicity or overdose. Combin-ing antiopioid vaccines with XR-NTX may provide prophylactic measures to subjects at risk of relapse and accidental or deliberate exposure. Combination therapy may extend to otherbiologics (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) and medications againstsubstance use disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Opioid use disorders (OUDs) remain a major problem world- wide, and new therapies are needed. This study reports on the combination of an oxycodone vaccine [oxycodone -keyhole limpet hemocyanin extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Results demonstrated that XR-NTX did not interfere with OXY-KLH efficacy, and combination of low doses of XR-NTX withvaccine was more effective than each individual treatmentalone to reduce behavioral and toxic effects of oxycodone, suggesting that combining OXY-KLH with XR-NTX may improve OUD outcomes. Introduction Opioid use disorders (OUDs) are a worldwide public health concern, and the World Health Organization estimated that there are 27 million people that suffer from an OUD [WHO, 2018]. In the United States, 2.6 million people are diagnosed with an OUD and at least 50,000 opioid-related fatal over-doses are reported annually (Jones et al., 2018). Clinical andepidemiologic data highlight that current treatment strate- gies for OUD are still insufficient to curb the occurrence of opioid-related fatal overdoses (Volkow and Collins, 2017).Approved medications for OUD largely consist of small molecule -targeting opioid receptors. Methadone, an opioid agonist, and buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, are effective treatments for OUD, but regulations, abuse liability,and diversion complicate their clinical use (Dodrill et al., 2011; Johanson et al., 2012). Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist used to treat OUD, may be less appealing because it lacks agonistreplacement effects and requires an abstinence period beforetreatment can begin. If patients stop taking naltrexone and resume opioid use, there is also an increased risk of overdose due to loss of opioid tolerance (Miotto Theapproval of extended-release naltrexone formula- reduced and Hulse, 2012). Alkermes, MA) antagonist therapy compliance and retention in treat- ment (Krupitsky et al., 2011, 2013; Coviello et al., 2012; This work was supported by National Institute of Health National Institute on Drug Abuse [Grant U01 DA038876] (to M.P.) and the Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute Translational Research Program. https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.120.000014. sThis article has supplemental material available at jpet.aspetjournals.org.

This extended-release formulation consisting of NTX embedded in microspheres provides stable plasma NTX concentrations in both animal and humansubjects for up to 28 days (Bartus et al., 2003; Dean et al.,2008; Bigelow et al., 2012). XR-NTX decreased hydromor- phone effects in human subjects (Bigelow et al., 2012) and blocked fentanyl and hydrocodone effects in rats (Dean et al.,2008). Although XR-NTX improved clinical efficacy of NTX (Krupitsky et al., 2012; Kelty and Hulse, 2012), its use and compliance maystill be limited by the need for monthly injections and increased likelihood of overdose during relapse or discon- tinuation of therapy (Kjome and Moeller, 2011). Thissuggests the need to develop new alternative treatments for OUD and to test their efficacy in combination with current FDA-approved medications. Vaccines may provide a safe, long-lasting complementary option to treat OUD. Active immunization with opioid-based conjugate vaccines elicits antibodies that selectively bind the target opioid in serum and extracellular fluids and mately oxycodone (OXY)-based practice -grade subunit key- hole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein generated a vaccine (OXY-KLH) that reduced the distribution of oxy-codone and hydrocodone to brain and their subsequent behavioral effects in mice and rats, including acquisition of oxycodone self-administration and oxycodone-induced geneexpression in the midbrain (Pravetoni et al., 2013, 2014a,b; Raleigh et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2019). Similarly, an analogous oxycodone vaccine reduced maintenance of oxy-codone intravenous self-administration (Nguyen et al., 2018). Although antidrug vaccines have been highly effective in rodents and primates, clinical trials for nicotine andcocaine vaccines showed proof of efficacy in a subset of high responders (Cornuz et al., 2008; Martell et al., 2009; Hatsukami et al., 2011). To increase efficacy against OUD,combining vaccination and XR-NTX could circumvent theshortcomings of both antibody -and small molecule -based interventions. The goal of this study was to test whether opioid receptor antagonist therapy could be combined with vaccines against opioids to provide better protection against OUD and possibly overdose. To this end, OXY-KLH and XR-NTXwere administered alone or in combination to evaluate their effect on oxycodone-induced antinociception, motor activity, respiratory depression, and bradycardia. Results demon-strated that XR-NTX did not impair oxycodone-specificantibody responses to OXY-KLH and did not interfere with the effects of vaccination on preventing oxycodone-induced motor activity. The combination therapy offered betterprotection than either treatment alone against opioid- induced locomotor activity, respiratory depression, and bradycardia after repeated exposure to high doses of oxy-codone. Although it is acknowledged that combining vac- cines with antagonists may limit analgesic options for patients, these data suggest that combination of an anti-opioid vaccine with XR-NTX may enhance efficacy of either treatment and may provide extra protection during non- compliance or in treatment-resistant patients.Materials and Methods Animals Male Holtzman rats (300 -324 g at arrival) were purchased from Envigo (Indianapolis, IN) housed in pairs on a 12/12 hour light/dark schedule and food restricted to 18 g/day of standard rat chow. Housing and feeding conditions replicated previous preclinical studies of theOXY-KLH vaccine (Pravetoni et al., 2012a, 2013). This study wasperformed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Animal protocols were approved by the Hennepin Healthcare ResearchInstitute Animal Care and Use Committee. Drugs Oxycodone was obtained through Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Oxycodone doses and concentrations were expressed as the weight of the base. Extended-release naltrexone (Vivitrol; Alkermes) was obtained through the Hennepin County Medical Center pharmacy, and its dosewas expressed as the weight of the microsphere as provided by the manufacturer. Vaccine An oxycodone-based hapten containing a tetraglycine linker at the C6 position (OXY) was first synthesized and then conjugated to chicken ovalbumin (OVA) or the KLH carrier proteins (Pravetoniet al., 2012a). Rats were immunized with either a decamer native KLH or a good practice -grade subunit KLH (dimer KLH, Stellar Biotechnologies). OXY-KLH adju- vant and administered intraperitoneally as described (Pravetoni et al., 2012a,b). In the final experiment, OXY-KLH was instead adsorbed onto Alhydrogel \"85\"2% aluminum hydroxide (Sergeant Chem, Clifton, NJ) and administered intramuscularly as described (Raleigh et al., 2017, 2018) to determine whether XR-NTX affectedimmunogenicity of a clinically relevant OXY-KLH formulation. To measure oxycodone-specific serum IgG antibodies postimmunization, ELISA 96-well plates were coated with OXY-OVA or unconjugatedOVA control in carbonate buffer and blocked with 1% gelatin. Primaryantibodies were incubated with goat serum previously (Pravetoni et al., 2012a). Opioid Level Analysis Oxycodone concentrations were measured by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry as previously described (Raleigh et al., 2017, 2018)and represented as total drug levels. Briefly, trunk blood was centrifuged at 3100 gfor 3 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and serum was collected. Brains were rinsed with distilled water and patted dry. Serum and brains were stored at 220\u00b0C until analysis. Opioid-Induced Motor Activity and Thigmotaxis Motor activity studies were conducted during the light cycle. Rats were first given 1 hour to habituate after transport to the behavioral testing room and then injected with saline or oxycodone, according to the experimental design, and placed in an open field (ENV-510S; MedAssociates, St. Albans, VT). The entire apparatus was enclosed in a sound-attenuating cubicle. Locomotor activity was monitored via infrared beam breaks and recorded by Activity Monitor 5.0 software(Med Associates). The thigmotaxis index was calculated as the ratio ofthe distance traveled in the external area to the one traveled in the center, which could be set in the software as a virtual divide (Pravetoni and Wickman, 2008). Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression and Bradycardia After 1 hour of habituation to the behavioral room, baseline % arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) and heart rate were assessedCombination of Opioid Vaccine and Naltrexone 393 at ASPET Journals on September 18, 2023 jpet.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from using a MouseOx (STARR Life Sciences Corp., Oakmont, PA) monitor collar placed around the neck of awake, freely moving rats ( n= 8 each group). Rats further received oxycodone every 17 minutes subcutane- ously so that their cumulative oxycodone doses at successive intervals were 2.25, 4.5, and 9.0 mg/kg. Fifteen minutes after each oxycodone injection, 10-second average % SaO 2and heart rate were again measured, which took 2 minutes for each animal, resulting in the17-minute oxycodone-dosing interval. When the last dose was admin- istrated, data were recorded twice 15 minutes apart. Experiments Experiment 1: Effect of Oxycodone on Motor Activity and Thigmotaxis Index in Nonimmunized Rats. Effect of oxycodone (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) on motor activity was established in nonvaccinated na\u00efve rats ( n= 7 per dose) to determine oxycodone doses to be used in subsequent studies. Rats were first given saline and habituated to the testing environment and activity chambers on three consecutive daily sessions (test days 1, 2, and 3). Oxycodone-induced motor activity was then assessed on alternate sessions (testdays 4, 7, 9, and 11). All testing sessions started immediately after injection, and activity was recorded for 90 minutes. See Fig. 1 for an overview of all experiments. Experiment 2: Effect of XR-NTX on Oxycodone-Induced Motor Activity, Thigmotaxis Index, Antinociception, and Oxycodone in Na\u00efve Rats. effect of XR-NTX on oxycodone-induced motor activity, thigmotaxis index, and evaluated in nonvaccinated na\u00efve rats. Rats ( n=8 -16 per group) received either saline or a range of XR-NTX doses (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg, i.m.) on days 0 and 36 to ensure consistent naltrexone serum concentrationsthroughout the entire study, because it has been shown that XR-NTX 's behavioral effects and serum naltrexone are no longer detectable byday 36 (Bartus et al., 2003). This formulation has been previouslyadministered to rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg i.m., which has been shownto elicit serum naltrexone concentrations of 4 -15 ng/ml for 28 days in rats shortly after administration (Bartus et al., 2003; Dean et al.,2008), which are similar to the therapeutic range observed in humanstreated with the same formulation (Bigelow et al., 2012). Rats receivedsaline on days 7, 8, and 9. Rats received 0.5 mg/kg oxycodone s.c. on days 10, 13, 15, 17, and 20. The oxycodone dose was chosen because it elicited a substantial increase in motor activity in a pilot study(Supplemental Fig. 1). The thigmotaxis index was calculated for each dose of XR-NTX. Two rats had very high thigmotaxis indices (46.5 and 168.5) in the 5 mg/kg group that were unexplained (Supplemental Fig.2). These were determined to be outliers, as detected using ROUT (Q =0.1%), and removed from analysis. On day 43, the effect of XR-NTX (0, 1, 2.5, 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg, i.m.) was tested on oxycodone antinoci- ception using a hot-plate set at 54\u00b0C as previously described (Prave-toni et al., 2013). Nociception was measured at 30 minutes after a doseof 2.25 mg/kg oxycodone s.c., which was previously shown to elicit a near-maximal antinociceptive response in this test (Pravetoni et al., 2012a, reaching the nociceptive behavioral endpoint orthe 60-second cut-off, serum and brain were for measure- ment of oxycodone as described previously (Pravetoni et al., 2013). Percent maximum possible effect was measured as posttest latency torespond minus baseline latency to respond divided by 60 seconds(maximum cut-off) minus baseline latency to respond times 100. In an independent experiment, the effect of XR-NTX on the time course distribution and area under the curve (AUC) of serum oxy-codone was measured in a separate cohort nonvaccinated ( n= 10 or 11, respectively) on day 0. On day 2, rats were anesthetized withketamine/dexmedtomidine and implanted with a right jugular veincatheter, which was flushed daily with 200 ml of heparinized saline and locked with 25% glycerol to maintain patency. On day 9, rats were fasted for 12 hours and dosed with 2.25 mg/kg s.c. oxycodone, and serum samples were collected at 15, 30, 60, and 180 minutes.Catheters were flushed with 200 ml heparinized saline between samples and locked with 50 ml of 25% glycerol after the 60-minute time point. Estimates for pharmacokinetic parameters, including half-life, maximum concentration (c max), time to reach c max(tmax), AUC, mean residence time, volume of distribution (Vd/F, volume over thefraction absorbed), and clearance (Cl/F, clearance over the fraction absorbed), were obtained from serum concentrations using noncom- partmental methods (Pravetoni et al., 2012a, 2013). Some rats wereremoved from analyses because fewer data points were collected, leading to final group sizes of n= 9 for XR-NTX and n= 8 for saline. Experiment 3: Effect of High Doses of XR-NTX on Oxycodone-Induced Motor Activity in Rats Immunized with OXY-KLH. The effect of mid and high doses of XR-NTX (5 or 50 mg/kg) on OXY-KLH vaccine behavioral efficacy was tested in ratsto assess whether combining antagonist with vaccination would showincreased efficacy compared with each individual treatment. Groups (n= 8/group) were as follows: 1) KLH + and 4) OXY-KLH received either saline or 50 mg/kg XR-NTX i.m. at 0 and 27 days. Concurrently, ratswere immunized with either 100 mg of the OXY-KLH vaccine or the unconjugated KLH administered on days 0, 21, and 42 in Freund 's adjuvant as previously described (Pravetoni et al., 2012a). On day 48,rats were tailbled for titers. On day 55, rats were tested for antinociception as described in Experiment 2 . On days 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 68, and 70, rats were tested in motor activity chambers with saline for the first three sessions and then challenged with oxycodone (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) for the next four sessions. Because 50 mg/kg XR- NTX completely blunted oxycodone-induced motor activity, rats wereheld for 1 month before retesting at a lower XR-NTX dose. Rats werevaccinated on days 83 and 104. Rats received a 5 mg/kg i.m. dose of XR- NTX on study day 98. On days 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 124, and 126 rats, were tested in motor activity chambers with saline for the firstthree sessions and then challenged with oxycodone (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) for the next four sessions. Experiment 4: Effect of Low Doses of XR-NTX on Oxycodone-Induced Motor Activity and Thigmotaxis in Rats Immunized with OXY-KLH. The effect of a low dose of XR-NTX (2.5 mg/kg) on OXY-KLH vaccine behavioral efficacy was tested in ratsto assess whether combining antagonist with vaccination would showincreased efficacy compared with each individual treatment. To this end, a dose of XR-NTX (2.5 mg/kg, i.m.) was used because it produced a suboptimal reduction of oxycodone-induced motor activity. Ratsreceived either saline or XR-NTX intramuscularly on days 0, 42, and70. Concurrently, these rats were immunized with either 100 mg of the OXY-KLH vaccine or the unconjugated KLH on days 0, 21, 42, and 72in Freund 's adjuvant as previously described (Pravetoni et al., 2012a). Groups ( n= 8) were designated follows: 2) KLH + XR-NTX. On day49, rats were tailbled for titers. Rats were first tested for baselinemotor activity after subcutaneous saline injections of 1 ml/kg on days 53, 54, and 55, which were followed by oxycodone-induced motor activity (as described above in Opioid-Induced Motor Activity and Thigmotaxis ) after subcutaneous injections of 0.5 mg/kg oxycodone on days 56, 59, 61, 63, and 66. To demonstrate increased efficacy ofa combination with XR-NTX and vaccination, rats were subsequentlychallenged with 1.0 mg/kg oxycodone s.c. on testing days 73, 75, and 77and 2.0 mg/kg on day 80. All sessions recorded motor activity and thigmotaxis. Experiment 5: Effect of Vaccination with OXY-KLH, Alone or in Combination with XR-NTX, on Oxycodone-Induced Motor Activity, Respiratory Depression, and Bradycardia. Rats received 2.25 mg/kg XR-NTX i.m. at 0 and 36 days. Concurrently, rats were immunized intramuscularly with either 60 mg of the OXY-KLH vaccine or the unconjugated KLH administered at days 0, 21, and 42.Aluminum hydroxide (90 mg) was used as the adjuvant. Groups ( n=8 ) were as follows: 1) + saline, and 3) OXY-KLH + XR-NTX. On day 49, rats were tailbled for titers. One week later, rats were given saline on three consecutiv e habituation sessions (days 53, 54,394 Raleigh et al. at ASPET Journals on September 18, 2023 jpet.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from Fig. 1.

On testing days 56, 59, 61, 63, 66, 68, and 70, rats were given escalating doses of oxycodone subcutaneously (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 mg/kg, respectively) to track a dose-dependent variation in motoractivity. On day 73, rats were tested for oxycodone-induced respiratory depression and bradycardia (as described above in Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression and Bradycardia ) 15 minutes after each dose of oxycodone that represented cumulative doses of 2.25, 4.5, and 9 mg/kg. Oxygen saturation and bradycardia were also measured 30 minutes after administration of 9 mg/kg oxycodone. Statistical Analyses and Calculations One- or two-way ANOVA paired with Dunnett 's or Bonferroni post hoc tests, respectively, were used to compare oxycodone antinociception, serum and brain d istribution, and oximetry data across groups. Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn 's multiple compar- isons post hoc test was used to compare antinociceptive effectsbetween groups in Experiment 3. Pharmacokinetic parameterswere and XR-NTX -treated groups using unpaired ttests, with Welch 's correction being used to compare groups. All statistics were performed with GraphPad Prism(version 8.0; La Jolla, CA). Results Experiment 1: Oxycodone-Induced Motor Activity and Thigmotaxis Index in Nonimmunized Rats. The effect of varying doses of oxycodone on total traveled distance in motor activity chambers was characterized in the absence of other treatments to determine baseline values (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Two-way (treatment /C2time) repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of time (F (6,162) = 32.92; P,0.0001) and interaction (F (24,162) = 3.56; P,0.0001) but not treatment (F (4,162) = 2.16). The 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg oxycodone doses did not significantly in- crease motor activity compared with the saline control group. The 0.75 mg/kg oxycodone dose increased activity on test day 7 (t (4)= 3.42; P,0.05) and days 9 and 11 (respectively, 4.61 and 4.48; P,0.001). The 1.0 mg/kg oxycodone dose increased motor activity on test days 9 and11 (t (4)=3 . 5 3a n ; P,0.05) compared with saline controls; however, this dose did not further increase motor activity compared with 0.75 mg/kg. Based on this pre- liminary study, subsequent testing of the efficacy of XR-NTX, vaccination, or their combination in blockingoxycodone-induced motor activity started from a midrange dose of 0.5 mg/kg oxycodone. Thigmotaxis index increased as a function of the oxycodone do se (Supplemental Fig. 1B), with one-way ANOVA showing a significant effect of treatment (F (4, 27) = 3.291; P,0.001) and a significant increase after 0.75 mg/kg oxycodone dose compared with control (q = 4.94; P,0.05). Experiment 2: Effect of XR-NTX on Oxycodone-Induced Thigmotaxis Index, Antinociception, Rats. 2A). Two-way (treat-ment/C2time) ANOVA showed significant effect = 54.98; P,0.0001), treatment (F (5,58) activity. XR-NTX significantly de-creased oxycodone-induced motor activity at all doses at and above 5 mg/kg (t = 4.01 -6.97; P,0.01). One-way ANOVA showed a effect of treatment (F (5,23.69 = 14.44;P,0.01) on thigmotaxis index. All doses of XR-NTX, except 1.0 mg/kg, were associated with a significant reduction (re- spectively, 2.5 -50 mg/kg, t = 4.84 -7.23; P,0.001) of the thigmotaxis index with saline 2B).XR-NTX administration reduced oxycodone antinociception (Fig. 2C). One-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of treatment (F (5,58) = 22.43; P,0.0001) on nociception in the hot-plate mg/kg, q = 6.96 -7.5; P,0.0001, respectively). One-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of on serum oxycodone distribution (F (3,28) = 7.51; (F (3,28) = 5.37; P,0.01, Fig. 2E). The two highest doses XR-NTX (25 and 50 mg/kg) significantlyreduced oxycodone 3.83 and 4.29; P,0.01 and P,0.001, respectively) and brain (q = 2.74 and 3.61; P,0.05 andP,0.01, respectively) 30 minutes after subcutaneous injection of mg/kg oxycodone. In rats, pretreatment with 50 mg/kg XR-NTX significantly reduced c max, AUC, and Cl/F after a 2.25 mg/kg, s.c. oxycodone challenge compared with saline pretreated rats (Table 1).Two-way ANOVA showed an effect of time (F (5,63) = 24.16; P, 0.0001) but no effect on treatment or interaction (Fig. 2F). No differences between groups were detected at any single time point. Experiment 3: Effect of High Doses of XR-NTX on Oxycodone-Induced Motor Activity in Rats Vaccinated 84 652/C2103, respectively (mean 6S.D.). There were no differences in titers between groups (Supplemental Fig. 3). Only XR-NTX and OXY-KLH + XR-NTX showed reduction in oxycodone-induced antinociception on the hot-plate (Supplemental Fig. 4). After subcutaneous 0.5 mg/kg oxycodone, two-way (treatment /C2 time) repeated-measures ANOVA showed on time (F (1.954, 54.70) = 24.08; P,0.0001), treatment (F (3, 28) = 20.76; P,0.0001), and interaction (F (18, 168) = 8.74; P, 0.0001) (Fig. 3A) on motor activity. Vaccination with OXY- KLH alone had no effect on motor activity compared with KLH-vaccinated rats. Rats treated with XR-NTX + OXY-KLH showed a significantly reduction in oxycodone-induced motoractivity on every test day [t(43 days) = days) = = 3.520; P,0.05] compared with saline control as well as after XR-NTX alone [t(43 days) = 4.057, t(46 days) 5.382, t(50 = 4.176; P,0.05]. After 1 month, rats were revaccinated and received a lower dose of XR-NTX (5 mg/kg). After subcutaneous administration (treatment /C2time) repeated- measures ANOVA showed a significant effect on time (F (6, 167) = 19.10; P,0.0001), treatment (F (3, 28) = 3.377; P,0.05), and interaction (F (18, 167) = 2.315; P,0.01) (Fig. 3B). Vaccination with OXY-KLH alone had no effect on motor activity comparedwith KLH-vaccinated rats. Rats treated with XR-NTX plusOXY-KLH showed a significantly reduction in oxycodone- induced motor activity on every test day [t(119 days) = 3.632, t(122 days) =2.727; P,0.05] compared with saline control as well as after XR-NTX alone on 2 days [t(122 days) = 2.640, t(124 days) =2.839; P,0.05].396 Raleigh et al. at ASPET Journals on September 18, 2023 jpet.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from Fig. 2.

In rats repeatedly challenged with 0.5 mg/kg oxy-codone s.c. (Fig. 4A), two-way (treatment /C2time) repeated- measures ANOVA showed a significant effect on time (F (7,189) = 46.54; P,0.0001), treatment (F (3,27) (21,189) = 9.2; P,0.001). Vaccination OXY-KLH alone and in combination with XR-NTX signifi- cantly reduced oxycodone-induced motor activity compared with KLH controls ( P,0.001). Subsequently, on testing days 73 -77, rats were challenged with 1.0 mg/kg oxycodone s.c. (Fig. 4B). Two-way (treatment /C2 time) repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant main effect of treatment (F (3,26) = 4.17; P,0.05). Treatment with OXY-KLH combined with XR-NTX reduced oxycodone- induced motor activity compared with KLH controls on testing days 73 and 75 [t(73 days) = 3.85; P,0.01, t(75 days) = 3.27; P,0.05, respectively]. No other differences were observed. There was no effect of vaccine or XR-NTX on oxycodone-induced thigmotaxis (Fig. 4C). Rats were then challenged witha final dose of 2 mg/kg oxycodone, s.c. but no differences were detected between groups (Fig. 4D).

There were no differences in titers between groups(Supplemental Fig. 3). Rats ( n= 8 each group) were first given saline on three consecutive habituation sessions. On alternate sessions afterward rats were administered 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 mg/kg of oxycodone (s.c.) to track dose-dependentvariations in motor activity brought on by oxycodone. Two- way (treatment /C2time) repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of time (F (7, 147) = 12.23) but not of treatment and interaction on oxycodone-induced activity(Fig. 5A). Because of the motor depressive effects of oxycodone at 2.5 mg/kg and above, the data were split and examined from0 to 2 mg/kg oxycodone dosing (Supplemental Fig. 5 shows motor activity up to 3.5 mg/kg). Two-way (treatment /C2time) repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of time(F (4, 84) = 24.42) but not of treatment and interaction on oxycodone-induced activity. Combination of XR-NTX and OXY-KLH vaccine showed a significant effect on reducingoxyocodone-induced motor activity after 1.0 mg/kg oxycodone administration (t = 3.08; P,0.01) compared with KLH control. No other differences were observed. Three days after motor activity testing, rats were tested for oxycodone-induced respiratory depression and bradycardia 15 minutes after each dose of oxycodone that representedcumulative doses of 2.25, 4.5, and 9 mg/kg. Two-way (treat- ment/C2time) repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant effect oxycodone dose on % SaO 2(F(4, 104) = 25.43; P, 0.0001) and heart rate (F 104) = 7.316; P,0.0001). Two-way (treatment /C2time) repeated-measures ANOVA also showed a significant effect of treatment on % SaO 2(F(2, 104) = 14.36; P,0.0001) and heart rate (F (2, 104) = 9.283; P,0.001). There was no interaction significance for either oxycodone dose ortreatment. Combination of XR-NTX and OXY-KLH showed higher % SaO 2levels after oxycodone administration of 4.5 mg/kg (t = 2.841; P,0.05), 9 15 minutes mg/kg (t = 4.229; P,0.001), and 9 30 minutes mg/kg (t = 4.091; P,0.001) compared with KLH control (Fig. 5B). Both KLH and OXY-KLH showed reduced % SaO 2levels at 4.5 mg/kg (t = 3.981, t = 4.116, t = 5.102; P,0.05), 9 15 minutes mg/kg (t = 3.397, t = 5.903, t = 7.427; P,0.05), and 9 30 minutes mg/kg (t = 3.981, t = 4.116, t = 5.102; P,0.05) compared with baseline levels, whereas combination of XR-NTX and OXY-KLH showed reduced % SaO 2levels only at 9 15 minutes mg/kg (t = 3.589; P,0.05). Combination of XR-NTX and OXY-KLH reduced the extent of bradycardia induced by 9 mg/kg oxycodone (t = 2.917, t = 2.881; P,0.05, 15 and 30 minutes after injection of the drug, respectively) compared with the KLH control and compared with OXY-KLH alone (t = 3.358; P,0.01) (Fig. 5C). Only KLH alone showed reduced % SaO 2levels at 9 15 minutes mg/kg (t = 4.281; P,0.05) and at 9 30 minutes mg/kg (t = 3.587; P,0.05) compared with baseline levels. Discussion This study provided preclinical proof of concept for combi- nation therapy against OUD by coadministration of an FDA- approved extended-release antagonist formulation and a can-didate vaccine against the prescription opioid oxycodone.The major findings were: 1) XR-NTX blocked oxycodone- induced motor activity and oxycodone antinociception in ratsTABLE 1 Effect of XR-NTX on pharmacokinetic parameters of oxycodone Effect of XR-NTX on the pharmacokinetic parameters of oxycodone after a of from zero to infinity; MRT, mean residence time; t max, time to reach c max; Vd/F, volume of distribution over the fraction absorbed; Cl/F, clearance over the fraction absorbed. *P,0.05; ** P,0.01 compared with saline treatment.398 Raleigh et al. at ASPET Journals on September 18, 2023 jpet.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from in a dose-dependent manner, 2) XR-NTX reduced distribution of oxycodone to serum and brain as well as the AUC, 3) XR-NTX minimally interfered with the OXY-KLH vaccine abilityto induce oxycodone-specific serum antibodies, and 4) the combination of XR-NTX with OXY-KLH showed greater effect than each treatment alone in reducing motor activity andanxiolytic effects as well as protecting against reduction of % SaO 2and heart rate induced by repeated doses of oxycodone in rats. Together, these data support the combination of antiopioid vaccines with XR-NTX for the treatment of OUD and possibly prevention of opioid-induced toxicity associated with fatal overdose (e.g., respiratory depression).To develop an animal model to test the effect of combining antiopioid vaccines with XR-NTX and compare their efficacyto each individual treatment, the effects of XR-NTX onoxycodone-induced motor activity and hot-plate analgesiawere tested in rats. Very low doses of naltrexone (naltrex- one:oxycodone dose ratio of 1:10 8) have been shown to enhance the motor activity induced by oxycodone (Leri and Burns, 2005). Higher naltrexone doses used in the current study (naltrexone:oxycodone dose ratio between 1:1.5 and 1:25) reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor activity in a dose-dependent manner. Yet, differences in experimental design complicate interpretation of preclinical data across studies. Abstinence from opioid use after XR-NTX has been demon-strated in humans with doses of 380 mg [5.4 mg/kg in a 70-kg human, (Nunes et al., 2015)], suggesting that these higher XR-NTX doses, as those used in the current study, are moretypical of those used clinically. Combining XR-NTX andvaccine concurrently so that lower doses of both could be used and side effects minimized would be the ultimate goal. XR-NTX dose-dependently decreased oxycodone-induced antinociception in the hot-plate test. Although this effect hasnot previously been demonstrated using oxycodone, similar effects have been shown for XR-NTX against morphine,fentanyl, and hydrocodone (Bartus et al., 2003; Dean et al., 2008). In these previous studies, very large doses of XR-NTX (50 mg/kg) were used to demonstrate that XR-NTX can blockantinociception. The current data extend this range of efficacyto much lower XR-NTX doses (down to 2.5 -5 mg/kg). However, different opioids may require more or less XR-NTX dependingon their relative at distri- bution oxycodone to serum and brain in rats. A secondexperiment showed that XR-NTX reduces the c max, clearance, and AUC after subcutaneous administration of oxycodone. These findings suggest that XR-NTX alters the pharmacoki- netics of oxycodone and the overall exposure of oxycodone inrats. It is not clear why XR-NTX produces these effects. Although it is possible that XR-NTX affected oxycodone absorption from the injection site into blood in this study, itis unlikely because XR-NTX and oxycodone were adminis-tered at different sites and times. Another possibility is that naltrexone interfered with analysis of oxycodone; however, this was not seen in preliminary in vitro studies. Although XR-NTX could have increased oxycodone clearance, accounting for both serum and brain oxycodone levels being lower in animals receiving naltrexone, we are aware of no reports of such aneffect. The reduced oxycodone brain concentration in presence of naltrexone could be due to an effect of naltrexone on opioid transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). For instance, ithas been shown that oxycodone, agonist, isactively transported across the BBB (Bostrom et al., 2006), although it is not clear whether oxycodone is a substrate for the well-characterized P-glycoprotein transporter (Bostromet al., 2005) or for another organic cation transporter (Okura et al., 2008; Sadiq et al., 2011). Interactions on transport across the BBB have been shown between oxycodone and other centralnervous system -acting drugs (Nakazawa et al., 2010). How- ever, naltrexone has been demonstrated to not have anyinteraction with P-glycoprotein transporters, so it is unlikelythat naltrexone affected these transporters to affect oxy- codone pharmacokinetics (Metcalf et al., 2014). Despite the unknown specific mechanism of this pharmacokineticFig. 3. Effect of high dose of extended-release naltrexone on oxycodone- induced motor activity in rats immunized with OXY-KLH.

(B) Rats were thenvaccinated on days 83 and 104. Rats received a lower XR-NTX dose of 5 mg/kg i.m. on day 98.

XR-NTX significantly lowered oxycodone-specific antibody titers only in selected experiments. XR-NTX 's effect on antibody titers was less evident when OXY-KLH was admin- istered intramuscularly in aluminum adjuvant. Similarly, theimmunomodulatory properties of naltrexone (or its XR-NTXformulation) seemed dose-dependent because this effect was significant at a low dose of XR-NTX (2.5 mg/kg) but not after a high dose (50 mg/kg). In a previously published study, XR-NTX did not interfere with the ability of OXY-KLH to induce antibodies in rats (Raleigh et al., 2017). In contrast, naltrex- one has been shown to have immunostimulant activity in oneFig. 4.

Chronicexposure in the current study versus acute exposure in the Sacerdote et al. (1997) study may explain these differences. Other studies have shown the use of naltrexone as an adjuvantto increase IgG 1and IgG 2aantibody levels for vaccines against parasites in mice (Tappeh et al., 2013; Mohammadza-deh Hajipirloo et al., 2014; Khorshidvand et al., 2016; Aziziet al., 2018). The authors suggested that naltrexone may promote a type 1 helper T cell and cellular immune response by increasing local proinflammatory neuropeptides and mayalso block opioid receptors on innate immune cells to promote local inflammation. Interference at the B cell receptor could reduce B cell activation and hapten-specific antibody pro-duction. Nevertheless, the immunomodulatory effect of XR-NTX in the current study was minimal, and all observed oxycodone-specific IgG antibody titers were within the range previously described for OXY-KLH (Pravetoni et al., 2012a,b,2013; Laudenbach et al., 2015; Raleigh et al., 2018). Drug-induced motor activity has been previously used as a means of screening vaccination efficacy against opioids andother drugs of abuse (Carrera et al., 2001; Cornish et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Wee et al., 2012; Raleigh et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2019). Fewer studies have characterized oxycodone-induced motor activity (Leri and Burns, 2005; Niikura et al.,2013) or tested the preclinical efficacy of XR-NTX in prevent- ing oxycodone-induced behaviors (Bartus et al., 2003; Dean et al., 2008). In the current study, vaccination with OXY-KLHalone had mixed effects on oxycodone-induced motor activity. At low oxycodone doses (0.5 mg/kg), OXY-KLH reduced oxycodone-induced motor activity if antibody titers were above200/C210 3but not if titers were under 50 /C2103. At oxycodone doses at or above 1.0 mg/kg, vaccine alone did not alter motoractivity. In contrast, a previous publication demonstrated thatOXY-KLH in alum reduced oxycodone-induced motor activity after a much larger oxycodone dose of 5 mg/kg in mice (Robinson et al., 2019). However, rats and mice demonstratedifferences in metabolism of oxycodone, which may in partexplain why oxycodone doses differed so much between studies (Ishida et al., 1982). In fact, doses of oxycodone that exceeded 2.0 mg/kg began showing reduced motor activitycompared with lower doses, suggesting that these doses are not appropriate for testing vaccine and XR-NTX effects. Combination of OXY-KLH and XR-NTX using high doses of XR-NTX (50 mg/kg) had no effect over XR-NTX alone becauseof the high XR-NTX dose. However, human doses are around 5.4 mg/kg (Bisaga et al., 2018). Thus, high XR-NTX doses maynot reflect real-world application of a combination therapy. Inthe current study, XR-NTX doses that were half of typical human doses (2.25 -2.5 mg/kg) were combined with OXY-KLH and demonstrated reduced motor activity compared with controls. Furthermore, combination of XR-NTX and OXY- KLH was more effective than vaccine alone in reducing Fig. 5.

Only one study has previously measured the effect of XR-NTX (at a dose of 50 mg/kg) on opioid-induced re-spiratory depressive effects (respiratory rate) and foundthat pretreatment with XR-NTX prevented fentanyl- induced respiratory depression (Dean et al., 2008). Com- bined, these data support the use of a combination therapyof OXY-KLH and XR-NTX. The clinical efficacy of vaccines against prescription opioids, and against opioids in general, may be limited by highlyvariable and low serum antibody concentrations achieved in immunized subjects or by the occurrence of opioid users switching or transitioning between prescription opioids andother opioids, such as heroin or fentanyl. These limitations can be overcome by combining vaccination with medications targeting opioid receptors. Opioid antagonists may provideadditional protection at the beginning of the vaccinationregimen prior to development of clinically effective serum antibody titers and may enhance efficacy of vaccination in people who are relatively poor vaccine responders by pro-viding additional blockage against the effects of prescription opioids. Additionally, if vaccination does not interfere with the efficacy of XR-NTX, patients wishing to change their type oftreatment may do so without fear of losing efficacy during the transition.
