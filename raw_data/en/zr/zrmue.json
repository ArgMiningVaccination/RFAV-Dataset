The findings were [published](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj1476) in Science Advances on Dec. 1, 2021. \"At the time we started this project, the first COVID-19 vaccines were just getting rolled out, and there was a lot of news about how they needed ultra-cold storage, and how that was a huge logistical challenge. Especially in low- and middle-income countries, it may not always be feasible to have that type of refrigeration infrastructure,\" says [Jonathan F. Lovell, PhD](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=jflovell), associate professor of biomedical engineering and senior author on the study. \"So we started to look at whether we could make a thermostable COVID-19 vaccine using a liposome-based vaccine platform that we worked on previously.\" Freeze-drying is a method for removing water from a product. First, you freeze the item you're trying to dehydrate, causing any water in it to become ice. Then, you remove the ice through a process called sublimation, in which ice turns directly into vapor under low pressure. A vaccine that employs the freeze-dried liposomes is still a long way off. But if developed successfully, dehydrated doses could be shipped and stored at room temperature, eliminating logistical problems associated with some of the most popular existing vaccines for the disease. The new study focuses on a liquid injection that consists of ingredients including water; specialized liposomes carrying a synthetically produced version of the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus; and a small amount of sugar, which helps to protect the formula during the freeze-drying process. The freeze-dried product \u2014 which looks a bit like cotton candy \u2014 is mint green in color. \"Upon dehydration, the formula was stable at elevated temperatures, and we showed that it can withstand room temperatures and even higher temperatures for at least a week,\" says Moustafa Mabrouk, a [doctoral student](/education/phd.html) in biomedical engineering and first author on the study. \"After that, we reconstituted the formula by adding water. When we tested this in mice, it induced effective antibody responses and offered protection against the COVID-19 virus.\" \"The COVID-19 pandemic stimulated interest in potent and thermostable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines \u2014 and Dr. Lovell's research team was forward-thinking in their approach of using a liposome-based platform to work on this formula,\" says [Allison Brashear, MD](/about/leadership_and_administration/dean.html), vice president for health sciences and dean of the [Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences](http://medicine.buffalo.edu/).

The specialized liposomes examined in the Science Advances study are being researched for potential use in vaccines against multiple diseases. The liposomes were originally developed in [Lovell's lab](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jflovell/) and have been licensed by the university to POP Biotechnologies Inc. (POP BIO), a startup company that Lovell co-founded. (Huang is also a POP BIO employee.) A [COVID-19 vaccine candidate](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/news_and_events/news/2021/03/covid-19-vaccine-lovell-12846.html) that relies on POP BIO's liposome-based vaccine delivery system is in human trials in South Korea. That vaccine candidate, called EuCorVac-19, is under development by POP BIO and South Korean biotech company EuBiologics. EuCorVac-19 has slightly different ingredients from the vaccine formula studied in the Science Advances paper. \"We have not tested freeze-drying on the EuCorVac-19 vaccine,\" Lovell says. \"However, I think the data in this new study suggest that, in theory, the EuCorVac-19 formula may be amenable to this type of treatment to make it very thermostable, which would benefit "}
