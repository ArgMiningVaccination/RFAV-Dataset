Answer: There is no evidence that vaccine-generated spike proteins are harmful. - The mRNA vaccines work by teaching our cells how to make a harmless spike protein that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. The body then makes antibodies to help you fight infection if the COVID-19 virus enters your body. - Some people are concerned that the spike proteins generated by COVID-19 vaccines can cause harm to the body's organs or tissues. However, there is no evidence that the vaccine-generated spike proteins cause harm. - COVID-19 infection, however, can damage many organs and tissues. It is important to focus on the right risk. - The vaccine-generated spike proteins don't last long in the body; the immune system quickly identifies, attacks, and destroys them. - Scientists estimate that the spike proteins, like other proteins our bodies create, may stay in the body for up to a few weeks.
