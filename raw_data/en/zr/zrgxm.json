The 5th Regional Meeting to review the progress of the West Eurasia FMD Roadmap was hel d in Astana, Kaza 23-24 April, 2014 (hereafter named '2014 Astana meeting'). Earlier meetings of the Roadmap included Istanbul 2009, 201 0, 2012; Baku 2013; and the 'f ounding' meeting was held in 2008 in Shira z, when the sub-regional Vision was discussed and agreed: 'West Eurasia region free of clinical FMD by 2020 '. The Vision timeline was expanded to 2025 during the 2013 Baku meet ing. 2. The 2014 Astana meeting was held in the fram ework of the FAO-OIE Gl obal Framework fo r the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs), with the collaboration and support of the European Commission for the Control of FM D (EuFMD) and the Kazakhstan government. The OIE Sub-Regional FMD Coordination Unit Office in Central Asia, newly established (October 2013) in Astana, was in charge of the local organization, while the Global GF-TADs FMD Working Group and EuFM D were in the fore-f ront for all technical aspects, prior to and during th e meeting. 3. Out of the 14 countries member s of the West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, 13 countries attended the meeting (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaij an, Georgia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Syria); only Turkmenistan wa s not able to attend. Russia attended the meeting as an Observer, as recommended during the 2013 Baku meeting, as well as representatives of dono rs and private firms. The Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mr Asylzh an S. Ma mytbekov, the Vice-Minister of Agriculture, Mrs Gulmira Issayeva, and representatives of FAO and OIE attended the meeting. The meeting agenda and list of participants are in Annexes 1 and 2 . 4. As for the previous meetings, the objec tives of the 2014 Astana meeting were to : a. Review the progress along the Regional Roadmap towards the Vision identified at th e Shiraz Meeting in 20 08 (and revised in 2013) of a \"West Eurasia region free of clinical FMD by 2025\"; b. Share information on FMD virus circulation with in the West Eurasia FMDV ecosystem to assi st planni ng of vaccination and other preven tive measures in the short-term; c. Support countries to prepare national project propos als for investment in FMD control in view of the regional cont ext. 5. An important output of the meet ing is the annual assessment of the PCP-FMD Stages for all countries, following a multi-stage process: (i) preliminary asse ssment by the WG with the assistance of EuFMD experts, ba sed on the self-assessment questionnaires and supporting evidence sent by the countries prior to the meeting; (ii) presentation of the countr y report during the meeting; (iii) country intervie ws durin g the meetings, conducted jointly by the WG wi th the assistance of EuFMD; (iv) preliminary discussions among the Roadmap Advisory Group and the WG and EuFMD experts; (v) final assignment (GF-TADs Acceptance) proposed by the West Eurasi a Regional Advisory Group (RAG) and agreed in plenary sessi on. 6. Members of the RAG were newly elected due to changes in the CVOs in the past year. Elected members of RAG are Dr Irfan Erol, CVO of lut from Turkey (lead of WELNET Network); and Dr Na ser Rasouli from Iran (lead of the Epi-Network).5th West Eu7. The pr o control particip a Outc 8.

The 2014 PCP-FMD Stage acceptance will therefore be finalized in Fall 2014 . 12.Ov erall, the 2014 PCP-FMD Stage Acceptance shows that the Roadmap remains on track to achieve the sub-regional vision by 2025. The Astana meeting was a key milestone for the We st Eura sia region as seven countries are likely to progress to PCP-FMD Stage 2, indicating the implementation of risk-based control measures . For 20 14-2015: 13. Final acceptance of 2014 PCP-FMD Stages and 2025 Roadmap will be provided by the RAG in Fall 2014, after analysis of additional requested evidence. 14. (New) Countries in PCP-FMD Stage 2 will need to invest heavily in FMD vaccination programmes. Therefore, effective use of vaccine, including regular assessment of vaccine matching with local field strains, will be extremely important. The establishment of a regional va ccine bank could be explored for the timely delivery of quality vaccine s. 15. FAO and OIE, in collaboration with EuFMD and the WELNET and EPI-NET regional networks, will provide reinforced support to countries, notably to the four countries remaining in PCP-FMD Stag e 1. The newly established OIE sub-regional Unit Office for FMD in Central Asia will play a pivotal role in this regard, and could act as the West Eurasia FMD R oadmap Secretariat, provided the decisi on is made by the GF-TA Ds Management Committee. 16. For countries currently bel onging to two regional Roadmaps (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Syria), the GF-TADs Management Committee may also decide to position them in only one regional Roadmap, to avoid possible discrepancies in PCP- FMD Stage Acceptance (although they may attend the meetings of the alternate regional roadmap as observers). 17. The identification of Contact Points from each county as specialists on issues related to PCP-FM D, the laboratory and the epidemiology is recommended to fa cilitate communication and coordination in matte rs related to PCP question naires, national control plans and laboratory and epidemiology net works. This will be an important step to move the PCP process forward.5th West EuReco Reco Consid erin \u2014 The im Roa dma \u2014 The co m Mouth review m \u2014 The adincludi n \u2014 The im p and le a the ass e \u2014 That m a countri e \u2014 That p r epidem develo p \u2014 Althou g differen global a \u2014 The n e propos a \u2014 That e ff and th a compet \u2014 That s o and co s nationa \u2014 That c o assess m urasia FMD Romm ommend W ng: portance of ap meetings mmitment o f Disease (P C meetings; ded value i n ng the prese n portance of h aders of the e essments to any countri e es are requir rogression a iology, virol o p a control s t gh the FMD t.

The countries recommend, for a better implementation of the Global FMD Control Strategy at regional level: 1.To continu e the Roadmap process for West Eurasian countries, with an annual survey (based on the self-assessment questionnaires) and meeting to monitor progress (if funding available); 2.That co untries which have a provisional PCP-FMD St age 2 submit the revised risk-based strategic plan for review no later than October 2 014 with evidence of the feasibilit y for implementation; control plans sho uld be submitted to the GF-TADs FMD Working Group ( FAO-FMD@fao.org and OIE-FM D@oie.int) to provide feedback and recommendations to countries on their risk-based stra tegic plans for effective implementation in coherence with the FMD-PCP guidelines ; 3.That countri es be provided with the necessary assist ance and training to develop FMD control plans; in particular, FAO/OIE with the support of t he experts from EuFMD are requeste d to : \u2014 further devel op the guidance on PCP-FMD project prop osals that could assist national authorities to obtain national and international investment on FMD control; \u2014 provide guidelines and support countries to conduct socioeconomic impact assessments of FMD in livestock production, livelihoods and food securi ty and to conduct cost/benefit analyses of FMD control options; 4.That each country identif y a specia list for PCP-FMD, a specialist for laboratory and a speciali st for epidemi ology to facilitate communication and co ordination in matters related to PCP-FM D que stionnaires, national control plans and the laboratory and epidem iology networks; 5.That countries be actively involved in the OIE PVS Pathway to improve their compliance with the OIE international standards on quality of Veterinary Serv ices and that Governmental Authorities support the development of an 'Enabling Environment', of which th e reinforcement of Veterinary Services is an integral comp onent; 6.That cou ntries consider reciprocal and regular comm unications with neighbouring countries to asse ss and mitigate risk across borders, and can seek assi stance from FAO and OIE to facilitate if deems necessa ry; 7.That Veteri nary Services ensure that the vaccines us ed are appropriate for the viruses circulating in the region. The most appropriate vaccines for current risk in the region and recommended for use in 2014 are: For type O: PanAsia2 (O Tuk 5/2009), or O1 Manisa in combination with O 3039. Vaccine matching data suggest that some circulating strains have poor match with O1 M anisa; For type A: A Tur06 or A Iran 05 (sublineage SI S10). For countries bordering Chi na, it is advisable to add A SEA-97 in their vaccine; For type Asia 1; Asia 1 (Sindh-08) or closely related strains or Asia 1 Shamir at 13 PD50 or greater . That greater use should be made of the vaccine ma tching services offered by the World Reference Laboratory at Pirbright and other FAO/OIE Reference Centres; in particular, that the countries seek technical advice from the FAO/OIE Reference Centres for careful consideration when selecting vaccine strains against A Iran 05 sublineages; 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 128.That vaccine s used by countries in the region comply with the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals and in particular, the potency of the vaccines should be selected based on a consideration of the level of protection re quired against the main circulating viruse s; 9.That countri es receive technical support and assist ance from FAO, OIE and EuFMD in the design of serosurveillance, identification of risk hotspots, effective vaccination strategy and post vaccination monitoring, when requested ; 10.That mo re effort be made to achieve the rapid sharing of laboratory information (transparency) on FM D virus ci rculation between countries of the region through support to the WELNET and to reference laboratories providing vital services to the Road map; 11.That the GF -TADs FMD Working Group support countries , when requested and, if funding available, fo r prep aring project proposals to convince governments and donors for more investments in preventing a nd controlling F MD; 12.That the West Eurasia Roadmap programmes be well articulated with other regional control programme s su ch as in the Middle Ea st; Specifically regarding the Epi-Network and WELNET 13.That the Epi-Network encourage countries to harmonise their animal health information system and support the interoperability between existing national and regional syst ems (such as the West Eurasi a FMD data base) and with WAHIS to facilitate the country's obligation for disease repo rting; 14.That webinars are offered to WELNETand Epi-Networ k members to connect experts and provide training on technical topics such as designing and monitori ng vaccination programs and outbreak investigation; 15.That count ries be provided with the necessary traini ng to ensure that there is capacity to monitor the impact and implementation of national strategic FMD contro l plans; this will include training in descri ptive epidemi ology, risk analysis, value chain analysis and data manage ment; 16.That a pilot project be undertaken in cooperation with Epi Network members to monitor the prices of live animals and meat in different countries, as an indicato r to predict large-scale animal movement pattern s; 17.That the WELNET thoroughly review the minimum potency requirements for vaccines for use in West Eurasia and provide a recommendation to the next meeting. This analysis should take production capacity and costs into ac count; 18.That the WELNET deve lop guidelines on the selection of samples for further characterization by genotyping and vaccine matching, support should be provided to send virus samples from WELNET member states to the SAP Institute, Pirbright and A RRIAH for detailed characte rization and rapid result repo rting, and to proficiency testing an d improved networking and communica tion.5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 13Report of the Meeting by Day Session 1: FMD Situatio n and Regional Roadma p Overview of global and regional FMD situation [Emma Fishbourne / WRLFMD ] The WRLF MD received 401 samples in 2013, from which they obtained 259 virus isolates representing five FMDV serotypes (O, A, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2). Significant events detected include: \u2014 A serotype O isolate from the Indian sub-continent (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001) was detected in Libya and Saudi Arabia in 2013 and UAE in 2014. The sequence dat a suggest that there were multiple independent introductions of this lineage from the Indian sub-continent. \u2014 The outbreaks in North Africa follow closely after FMD cases due to serotype SAT2 which were introduced into the region in 2012. These patterns give an indication of the changing risks and movements of viruses across West Eurasia and North Africa. \u2014 Detection of serotype O/ME-SA/P anAsia in the Russian Federation and Mongolia in 2014, and serotype A/Asia/Sea-97 in Russia. Based on this, important FMD threats to the West Eura sia region are the currently circulating strains (O/ME- SA/PanAsia2, A/Asia/Iran-05 and Asia 1 (Sindh-08 lineage) plus strains that might enter the region from neighbouring endemic pools. These threats are not equally distributed across West Eurasia and include: from Pool 1: O/ME-SA/PanAsia, O/SEA/Mya-98, A/Asia/Sea-97; from Pool 2: O/ME-SA/Ind2001; and from Pool 4: SAT2. Vaccine matching data from 2013 were presented: \u2014 For serotype O (O/ME-SA/PanAsia2 lineages), most vaccines showed a good match except O/Manisa which does not always match using the in-vitro test. \u2014 For serotype A (A/ASIA/Iran-05 lineage) - the in-vitro vaccine matching test provides evidence for the continued evolution of the antigenic profiles of the A/ASIA/Iran-05 sub-lineages that are co-circulating in West Eurasia. The observation that some recent field strains do not appear to be well matched to any of the vaccines tested at WRLFMD warrants close monito ring of the effectiveness of these vaccines in the field (supplemented by vaccine trials and submission of samples). Recent testing of samples at WRLFMD has highlighted the importance of completing a full vaccine course (i.e. a primary dose, followed by a booster approxim ately 4 weeks later). This was shown with graphs highlighting the increase in antibody levels following t he second booster injection given 28 days after the first vaccination in a series of vaccine trials. Link to the presentation: http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd /Roadmap_2014_Astana/WRLFMD__Fishbourne.pdf FMD-PCP principles FAO] The PCP -FMD Guide, initially developed by FAO and EuFMD in 2008, became a joint FAO-OIE-EuFMD tool after its revision in 2011. It is now a well-recognized t ool, used in many countries worldwide as a monitoring tool to progressively improve FMD control in endemic countries. It will be updated to take into account the 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 14outcomes of the Bangkok conference and notably ensure full consistency with components 2 and 3 of the FAO/OIE Global Strategy fo r the control of FMD. Questionnaires (one for each stage 1, 2 and 3) were developed in 2011 as companion tools of the PCP-FMD Guide to serve as assessment tools and help countries assess their progression along the PCP-FMD pathway. A template was also produced to help c ountries design their risk -based strategic plan when entering PCP-FMD Stage 2, based on the achievement s and epidemiological understanding gained in PCP- FMD stage 1. All these tools need to be updated to become exclusive GF-TADs tools and be fully aligned with the FAO/OIE Global Strategy. In particular, linkage s with the OIE standard on the quality of Veterinary Services are on-going to ensure a proper delineation of the 'Enabling Environment' concept in the specific context of FMD prevention and c ontrol (see next presentation). Detailed procedures will be drafted regarding how to use these tools in a self (country) or external independent (GF-TADs experts) evaluation mode. A pr ocess involving the Regional Advisory Group, composed of Delegates of the region and heads of r egional laboratory and epidemiological networks, was implemented during regional FMD Roadmap meetings. The RAG's main task is to grant countries with a FMD-PCP stage based on the assessment questionnaire s, evidence provided by countries, country interviews during regional Roadmap meetings and their knowledge of the regional situation. The specific Terms of Reference of the RAG were prepared by the GF-TADs FMD Working Group. The global GF-TADs FMD Working Group brings the necessary tec hnical and logistical support to the RAGs. Link to the presentation:??? Links/complementarities between PCP-FMD and PVS linkages between the PCP-FMD and OIE's work already exist since, at the end of the PCP-FMD Stages 4 and 5, countries may apply for an OIE official re cognition of FMD free status, respectively with and without vaccination in accordance with Chapters 1.6 and 8.6 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, 2013 version (TAHC). In PCP-FMD stage 3, a country can also request the endorsement of its national FMD control programme by the OIE. In the very early stages of embarking into the PCP- FMD, a country should ensure that it progressively acquires the appropriate structures, organization, m anagerial capacities as well as human and financial resources to implement activities planned for the contro l \u2014 or eradication \u2014 of FMD and other TADs. This is known as the ' enabling environment ' of the PCP-FMD, implying the progr essive institutionalization of FMD prevention and control and compliance with OIE standard on the quality of Veterinary Services. Chapter 3.1 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code on the qualit y of Veterinary Services notably provides 'intrinsic' standards. Compliance of the Veterinary Services with Chapter 3.1 enables them to further comply with the other Chapters of the OIE Code, including those relat ed to FMD (chapter 8.6). Chap ter 3.2 on the evaluation of the Veterinary Services recomm ends using the OIE PVS Ev aluation tool (auto-eval uation mode or external independent evaluation by OIE certified experts). To clarify the notion of 'enabling environment', OIE prop oses to use the Critical Competencies (CCs) of the OIE PVS evaluation tool and to link them to a specific PCP-FMD Stage. Thirty-three of the total 47 CCs are particularly relevant to the prevention and control of FMD and other TADs. In other words, for a country embarking into the PCP-FMD, VS capacity should develop according to PCP-FMD timing and requirements. Such a correspo ndence between the OIE PVS CCs and the PCP-FM D Stage is specified in Component 2 of the FAO/OIE Strategy for t he Control of FMD: for PCP-FMD Stage 1, 7 OIE PVS CCs for FMD OIE PVS CCs are relevant; for PCP-FM D Stage 3, all 33 OIE PVS CCs are relevant. For example, the focus of PCP-FMD Stage 1 is 'To gain an understanding of the epidemiology of FMD in the 5th West Eucountry an d as particul a education; e regulations; While the p concrete m under disc u OIE PVS F o Link to the p Prese n [Gian c During the following c o 1.

The information presented is summarized in Annex 3. Country presenters were: A. Naseri (Afghanistan), S. Kharatyan (Armenia), T. Aliy eva (Azerbaijan), M. Sokhadze (Georgia), N. Rasouli (I.R. Iran), Alazzawi (Iraq) S. Sapargaliev (Kazakhstan), A. Zhusupov (Kyrgy zstan), M. Afzal (Pakistan), H. Alsulayman (Syria), K. Odinaev (Tajikistan), N. Bulut (Turke y), and O. Saidovich (Uzbekistan). Session 3: Specific issues Socioeconomic analysis and guidelines [Julio Pinto / FAO] Tran sboundary animal diseases including FMD are endemic in many developing countries. The Veterinary Services in these countries may lack resources to ade quately prevent, detect and respond to these diseases. Livestock disease has broad impact on the national economy, social, food and production systems, through the effects of disease, market disruption, implementation of prevention and control measures and, in the case of zoonoses, human health. Benefits to FMD control include avoided disease losses, avoided costs of disease risk management and consequential increased economic activity. Costs and benefits of improving FMD control in endemic countries have been estimated and are included in the FMD Global Strategy. Socio-economic analysis of animal diseases is useful to assess if the disease has an important economic impact, to determine the likely returns of alternative approaches to control and to discover if a particular policy has been a good public investment. Some studies have been done regarding the impact of FMD in endemic countries, and vaccination was determined to be beneficial. Appropriate analytical tools include partial budget analysis, cost/benefit analysis, cost effe ctiveness analysis and risk analysis. Some of these tools are more appropriate at different points in the PCP-FMD, and guidelines for socio-economic analysis in the context of the PCP-FMD are being developed by the OIE/FAO GF-TADS FMD Working Group with expert support. Link to the presentation: http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/R oadmap_2014_Astana/FMD_SocioEconomics__Pinto.pdf New tools for improving national disease reporting [Julio Pinto / FAO] In many countries, surveillance programs contribute to the threat of emerging di seases and further spread of endemic diseases due to under-reporting, lack sensitivit y and lack of timely reporting. However, in these same countries there is a proliferation of mobile te chnology and access to this technology is rapidly improving, even in remote places. This improvement in technology has led to the development of tools that 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 18can improve disease surveillance and reporting. In this presentation, a number of these tools were described, including: \u2014 A SMS gateway to facilitate the reporting of disease in poultry in Bangladesh. An FAO project funded by USAID, this tool reduced the time for risk management from disease detection to disinfection from 4.8 days to 1.5 days. \u2014 Digital Pen Technology used in Southern Africa allows disease data to be transmitted automatically from the field to a server with a special digital pen and from a special paper disease surveillance form. \u2014 FAO's Global Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) records disease events on a public website, as well as hosting surveillance data from FAO projects including FMD and allowing specialised analysis on an internal website. \u2014 The West Eurasia FMD database is housed within the EMPRES-I system, and is a secure, password protected website. Participating countries enter outbreak and vaccination data on a monthly basis, and can visualise their own data in the form of charts and maps. \u2014 Event Mobile Application (EMA-i) allows outbreak and epidemiological data to be entered from the field using smartphones. It also allows the mobile user access to relevant epidemiological information and to visualise the location of other nearby outbreaks recorded in the database on a map. It also generates early warning notifications through email that are sent to users of the sy stem and decision makers, including the CVO of the country. EMA-i is available for countries to use on a pilot basis, and this is currently being carried out in Uganda. Link to the presentation: http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/R oadmap_2014_Astana/Mobile_Technologies__Pinto.pdf Post-vaccination monitoring [Samia Metwally / FAO] The effectiveness of a vaccination program is its success at fulfilling the desired outcome in the field. Vaccination program effectiveness will be influenced by: host factor s (age, health etc); vaccine characteristics (potency, purity, comp osition etc); application (timing, va ccinators, cold chain) and the match to the circulating virus. The cost effectiveness of a vaccine program will depend on the cost of disease relative to the cost of the vaccine and the proporti on of the disease burden that is vaccine preventable. Post-vaccination monitoring is necessary to optimise va ccination programs and the use of limited resources. By demonstrating the impact of the vaccination program on the disease burden, it assist s to justify the cost of the vaccination. It also stimulates the production of high quality vaccine and/or the development of improved vaccines. Post-vaccination monitoring guidelines are being developed by an expert team with the aims 1) to provide practical guidance on how to evaluate the effectivene ss of an FMD vaccination program and 2) to be tailored to the needs of countries at different stages of t he PCP-FMD. The guidelines will include 4 chapters: 1.Vacci ne attributes: describing vaccine types, quality, considerations when purchasing a vaccine including vaccine matching and the selection of vaccine strain s 2.Vacci ne delivery, schedule and coverage 3.Evaluation of the immune response: this evaluation will be dependent on the aim of the vaccination program (whether to reduce clinical FMD incidence, to eliminate FMDV circulation, to maintain FM D freedom or to regain FMD freedom). 4.Monitori ng the impact of vaccination and other c ontrol measures: this involves monitoring the vaccination, clinical FMD and/or FMDV infection to determine if the vaccination program is achieving the expected outcome. Outcomes will vary in different countries and may be r educing the incidence of5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 19 disease and/or infection, ensuring that the incidence of disease or infection is below a defined target value or demonstrating that disease or infection is absent. Challenges in post-vaccination monitoring include that the correlation between protection and antibody titres has not been disclosed for some viral strains, unavailab ility of suitable serological ELISA tests for the recent vaccine strains and absence of certified vacci ne quality control centres for FMD. It is anticipated that the guidelines will be published by the end of 2014, and training in their content will be provided. The guidelines will be subject to revision fo llowing their validation through use in countries.

Recent meetings include notably: \u2014 The 6th (MC6, Rome / Italy, 28 March 2013) and 7th (MC7, Paris / France, 12 September 2013) meetings of the GF-TADs Management Committee; \u2014 The 6th meeting of the Global GF-TADs Steering Committee meeting (GSC6, Rome / Italy, 29-30 October 2013); \u2014 The 8th meeting of the regional GF-TADs for Africa St eering Committee meeting (Accra / Ghana, 17-18 June 2013); \u2014 The 6th meeting of the regional GF-TADs for the Mi ddle-East Steering Committee meeting (Amman / Jordan, 22 September 2013); \u2014 The 5th meeting of the regional GF-TADs for Europe St eering Committee meeting (Brussels / Belgium, 8- 9 October 2013). During these meetings, FMD situation is systematical ly reported and assessed using the global GF-TADs 5- year Action Plan as well as 5 regional GF-TADs 5-y ear Action Plans (2012-2016), which provide for FMD and other priority TADs (i) expected results, (ii) indica tors to measure progress overtime and (iii) a baseline situation dated 2011 against which situations are report ed annually or every two year s. These meetings also give the opportunity to report on the state of implementation of the FAO/OI E Global Strategy for the control of FMD endorsed in Bangkok / Thailand in June 2012 at global and regional levels. Recommendations are produced during these meeting, notably to serve as r oadmaps for countries, dealing with the governance of Veterinary Services and the prevention and c ontrol of priority TADs including FMD. Under the GF-TADs umbrella, also took place an inter-regional Consultative Meeting on FMD & PPR Situation Progress (Amman/Jordan, March 2-4 2014), which included the 3 rd regional FMD Roadmap meeting, to (i) share information on FMD viruses' circulation within the Middle East and North Africa countries, (ii) review the progre ss of each country along the PCP-FMD and (iii) assist countries preparing national control plans, project proposals for increased investment on FMD control and submissions to OIE for control programme endorsement and possible FMD stat us recognition. Several countries of the West- Eurasia FMD Roadmap meeting (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey) also belong to this Roadmap for the Middle East countries, both Roadmaps addressing Virus Pool 3. 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 20 Link to the presentation: http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd /Roadmap_2014_Astana/Update_on_meetings__Weber__D omenech.pdf Updates on World (WAHIS) [Laure Weber-Vintzel / OIE] OIE Member Countries have a obligation (Organic Statutes; article 1.1.3 of the OIE TAHC) to report their animal disease situation, including zoonoses, in the most transparent and timely manner, for OIE listed diseases and any emerging diseases. Withholding facts on the incidence of relevant diseases by the OIE would constitute a violation of its Organic Statutes. In order to help Members fulfil this duty, the OIE developed the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) and the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID). This tool is a milestone in OIE efforts to improve the transparency, efficiency and speed with which global animal health information is disseminated throughout the world. It is both a monitori ng system - to report on the presence or absence of diseases on a 6-monthly basis and an early warning sy stem - to report immediate notification of exceptional epidemiological events, and their follow up and final reports. In August 2012, the OIE launched the second versi on of its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), six years after the first one. The major change in this new version is the integration of a specific section for wildlife diseases notif ication into WAHIS. It allows Members to complement compulsory information on OIE-listed diseases in wild species and also to notify on a voluntary basis specific wildlife diseases that are not officially OIE-listed. The new version of WAHIS contains many other improvements including new options such as: \u2014 The possibility to identify affected wild spec ies by taxonomic family and Latin names; \u2014 A new integrated database containing susceptible wild species by disease; \u2014 The possibility to notify clusters of outbreaks; \u2014 The addition of an upload function to facilitate quantitativ e data reporting; \u2014 The possibility to provide the terrestrial and aquatic animal health reports separately.

The Veterinary Services of every country in the region should have access to the expertise it requires to develop and implement their national FMD control strategy. Report from WELNET and Epi Network (Naser Rasouli, Iran) presented the results of the informal discussions held after Se ssion 2. Grigor Grigoryan (EuFMD) summarised the discussions amongst Russian-speaking members. The networks history and activities were reviewed. Since 2009, network activities have included diagnostic training (2010), a course in practical Epidemiology for Progressive control (PEP-C) and the fa cilitation of sample shipment from Iraq to Ankara. These activities have assisted in improving the awaren ess of FMD risks in the region, in particular through the identification of epidemic events at an earlier stage. 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 21Network me mbers agreed that participation in Webinars would be a valuable activity to improve knowledge and maintain communication among members. Topics suggested for the Webinar include: vaccine/vaccination, post-vaccinati on monitoring, animal movements/ma rkets, early detection of FMD, monitoring and evaluation, and strategy development. To improve early detection of new threats, there is some interest in developing a system to send FMD samples to laboratories in the region on a monthly basis. To date, logistics of transport hinder this activity. A project to monitor the market prices of meat an d live animals on a monthly basis was proposed. It is expected that such an activity would provide insight into changing animal movement patterns. Regarding vaccination, a workshop on non-structural protein (NSP) in vaccine was proposed. Also, it was requested that a template be developed to assist coun tries preparing a tender for vaccine purchase. Vaccine producers were requested to subm it data on potency and strains. Experts were encouraged to further develop instruments to assist decision making. Through sharing national FMD Control Plans, countries may better organise and coordinate the regional FMD response. Finally, there was a call for countries to nominate focal points to facilitate network activities between Roadmap meetings. Melissa McLaws (EuFMD) presented the results of the vaccination survey (see Annex 5 ).

This template may be useful for countries moving from PCP-FMD Stage 1 to Stage 2 and, with slight modifications, from Stage 2 to Stage 3. The template is intended as a guideline and its use is not a requirement to move along the FMD Pathway. This template has been applied in 3 EuFMD Member stages to-date, with a positive re sponse. Further training materials and workshops are being developed. The template will be completed and modified appropriately under GF TADs WG responsibility in order to ma ke it a generic FAO OIE GF TADs Control Plan template to be used by interested countries all along the FMD PCP. 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 22 The template consists of 6 chapters: 1. Situation analysis: The FMD situation in the count ry is summarised, including the epidemiology, impact and control measures to date. Risk-hotspots and gaps are described. This chapter roughly corresponds to PCP Stage 1 activities. 2. Benefits of FMD Control: This ch apter describes what benefits are ex pected from improved FMD control for the different stakeholders. This information is important to promote advocacy for investment in FMD control. 3. The Strategy: this is the heart of the Plan, and includ es the long-term goal, immediate strategic objective, component objectives, tactics and activities foreseen under the Plan. 4. Monitoring and Evaluation: This describes how the impact and implementation of the plan will be monitored. It includes indicators, targets and means of verification for the strategic objective, component objectives and tactics. 5. Operational Plan: This outlines how the plan will actua lly be implemented. It includ es a description of the organization of FMD control in the country (roles and responsibilities), the budget, timeline and makes reference to specific Standard Operating Procedures and other technical documents, where appropriate. 6. Technical Assistance Plan: This chapter describe s the approach to address any gaps in funding and/or technical expertise needed to fully implement the Plan. Link to the presentation: http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/R oadmap_2014_Astana/National_Control_Plan__Ferrari__ Mclaws__Sumption.pdf Submission to the OIE for the endorsement of national Control Programmes and for the official recognition of FMD status for countries and zones [ Laure Weber-Vintzel / OIE] The official recognition of FMD status (or other diseases with an official OIE status) of Member Countries is of great significance for international trade and consti tutes one of the most impo rtant legal links between the OIE and World Trade Organization (WTO), in the fr amework of the WTO Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement, which allows OIE to recognise disease-free areas. A country may either lose or enhance its commercial attractiveness in the eyes of potential or existing importing partners, depending on official recognition of its disease status. By acquiring and main taining its official status, a country also demonstrates transparency and helps to promote animal health and public health worldwide. Granting of official disease status is handled in an objective and transparent manner, based on the scientific provisions of the OIE TAHC (or a detailed risk assess ment), and is subject to the adoption by the World Assembly of OIE Delegates (resolutions). Suspension an d recovery of a status ar e handled directly through a fast track procedure without further consultation of the OIE World Assembly of Delegates. Detailed Standard Operating Procedures for granting, suspending an d recovering an official OIE Status - in constant evolution - are available at: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal _Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/EN_SOP.pdf . For FMD, specific provisions to acquire an official stat us are laid down in Chapter 1.6 on the Procedures for self-declaration and for official recognition by the OI E and Chapter 8.6 on FMD of the OIE TAHC. Provisions are available for a country or a zone free of FMD, with or without vaccination. OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code Chapter on FMD, 2013 version Article 8.6.1. General provisions, including case definition Articles 8.6.2. to 8.6.9. Articles related to status country/zone/containment zone/ compartment/ recovery Articles 8.6.10. to 8.6.33.

Endorsement of the official control programme Article 8.6.49. Interpretation of diagnostic test results A Member Country wishing to be officially recognis ed as disease-free by the OIE should submit the questionnaire laid out in Chapter 1. 6. of the TAHC and comply with all requirements specified in the TAHC for FMD. However, it is important that the applicant count ry consider also all the other horizontal chapters of the TAHC, notably those related to notification, surveillance, veterinary services, identification and traceability of animals. This process - which require s a dedicated team, time and funding -also needs to involve all concerned services and stakeholders (wild life, private sector, etc) at national level. Member Countries with a FMD free status official ly recognised by the OIE must submit an annual reconfirmation form by the end of November every year. In 2012, the endorsement of a national control programme for FMD by OIE was put in place. The rationale behind the endorsement of official national control programmes for FMD is to act both as an acknowledgement for projects establishments and action s already taken by a Member Country to control FMD as well as an incentive to such a Member C ountry to proceed progressively on the way towards achieving FMD freedom. It should thus not be judged in the same manner as allocating a particular official disease status to a Member Country, and a specific procedure has been developed, also laid down in chapters 1.6 and 8.6 of the TAHC: new Articles 8. 6.48 and 1.6.10 on OIE endorsed FMD official control programmes provide standards specifically addre ssing the stages prior to country FMD freedom. Evidence of capacity of VS (PVS assessment) is a key aspect looked at for the endorsement of the control programme by the OIE (notably compliance with Chapter 3.1. of the TAHC on the quality of the Veterinary Services, and chapter 3.4 on veterinary legislation). As for official status, endorsement of national control programmes for FMD is also subject to the adoption by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates. Efforts related to status recognition and control plans endorsement do not stop when the evaluation is over: maintenance of these recognitions/endorsements need substantial and continuous efforts. 5th West EuLink to the p http://www. f m__Weber _ Sess Imple m Twenty nin should ser v proper implThe Global recommen d Out of the implement e as on-goin g Comm enda \u2014 the co __Domenec o e (29) reco ve as indica t ementation o GF-TADs F dations on a n 29 recomm ed/complete d g; 5 (recom m able achieve m tinuation of t basis: more Roadmap, A s: dmin/user_u p h.pdf oadmap c of 2013 Re c mmendatio n tors for cou n of the FAO/ O FMD Workin g n annual ba s endations, 6 d; 18 (recom mendations 8 ; ments over t h Roadm than 70% o stana / Kaza pload/eufmd / conclusi o commend a ns were agr e ntries and F OIE Global S g Group is i n sis, together w 6 (recomme n mendations ; 15; 19; 23; he past yea ap b of the countr i khstan, Apri l /Roadmap_ 2 on ations [Na d reed in Bak u FAO and OI E Strategy for t n charge of m with the rele v ndations 1; 2; 4; 5; 6; 7 ; 26) a s not i m r include: based on se ies belongin g l 2014 2014_Astan a d\u00e8ge Lebo u u/Azerbaijan E (under th e the control o monitoring t h vant region a 3; 12. 16; 2 ; 9; 10; 11; 1 mplemented lf-assessme g to the FM D a/.OIE_Statu ucq / OIE] in 2013.

Also, Asia-1 Sham ir vaccine was only used with a potency of 6PD50; \u2014 Russia is now a 'regular' Observer of the FMD West Eurasia Roadmap meetings (attended in Baku/2013 and Astana/2014); this is important to ensure Russia is informed on the Roadmap principles, process and vision. Russia declares several FMD outbreaks a year and may be interested in conducting such an approach at oblast level; On the other hand, several recommendations were not implemented: \u2014 Countries did not identify FMD Roadmap focal points fo r communication, to better promote the initiative at national and sub-regional level. Greater communi cation on a regular basis to the 14 countries of the Roadmap and to their international partners, is ne eded, and the proposed Newsletter, bulletins or other means to bring attention to new findings/th reats to FMD control are still to be developed; \u2014 The Epi-Network did not review comprehensively the epidemiology of FMD in West Eurasia since 2008, to summarize the findings and lessons learnt over the past five years; this should be done based on the detailed achievements of the count ry PCP-FMD Stage 1, and would allow countries to develop informed risk-based control plans to enter Stage 2 and st art implementing relevant control measures; \u2014 The WELNET did not review the minimum potency requirements for vaccines for use in West Eurasia, taking into account production capa city and costs. Specific guidelines on the selection of samples for further characterization by genotyping and vaccine matching have not been developed as requested; \u2014 Countries have not received support to send their samp les or virus isolates to the Pirbright Institute or ARRIAH for complete characterization and rapid result reporting; \u2014 Proficiency testing was not conducted in the countries of the sub-region; All the othe r 18 recommendations are currently being implemented, which demonstrates the dynamics of the actors in the region, towards achieving the sub-regional vision of freedom from clinical FMD by 2025. Notably, countries receive significant external sup port from FAO, OIE and EufMD to progress along the PCP- FMD Pathway. The 'on-going' and 'not completed' recommendations we re included as part of the recommendations of the 5 th meeting of the FMD West Eurasi a Roadmap meeting (Astana, 2014). Presentation of Roadmap based on post-assessment by the Roadmap Advisory Group [Irfan Erol, president of the RAG 2 014] The Te rms of Reference of the Regional Advisory Gr oup (RAG) indicate that the members are elected for a 3 year period, to ensure continuity and consistenc y in the assignments of PCP-FMD stages overtime; however, CVOs of the 2013 RAG had changed position ov er the past year. A call was made for renewal of membership of the Regional Advisory Group during the Astana meeting and the country representatives 'elected' three new members of the RAG 2014.

For countries remaining in PCP-FMD Stage 1, signific ant support from the GF-TADs and EuFMD will need to be provided in the next year, for them to gain a good understanding of the FMD si tuation country-wide and prepare a risk-based control strat egy to move to the next Stage. Provided the availability of fund, t he sixth FMD Roadmap meeting for West Eurasia may be held next year. The hosting country was not identified during the meeting. However, the Delegate of Kazakhstan expressed the willingness of his country to host the meeting, with the support of the newly established OIE sub-regional FMD Coordination Unit in Astana / Kazakhstan, and in collaboration with the FAO and the OIE Headquarters. At the request of the coun tries, the agenda of the 6th meeting will need to allocate more time to the country presentations, which provide key elements to the RA G to assign the PCP-FMD Stages in the most adequate manner. A meeting of the 2014 RAG is tentat ively scheduled before the end of 2014 (exact dates and location to be determined) to: 1) Assign final 2014 PCP-FMD stages upon revision of the updated risk-based strategic plans fo r cou ntries progressing to PCP-FMD Sta ge 2. 2) Discuss and agree on the provisi onal Roadmap progression until 2025. *** 5th West w urasia FMD Rx 2stana.pd f) 29 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 30Annex 2 List of Participants Members of the Roadmap Country First / Last name Title Afghanistan Dr. Naseri Aminuddin Director General of Animal Health Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock Armenia Hovhannes Mkrtchyan Head of Veterinary Inspection Republic of Armenia Ministry of Agriculture State Service for Food Safety Armenia Satenik Kharatyan DVM PhD.

That countries in the West Eurasia regi on have demonstrated their commitment to the Progressive Control Pathway for Foot and Mouth Disease (PCP-FMD) and Ro admap process by undertaking activities and actively participating in the annual progress review meetings; 2. Several projects involving international support fo r FMD control in the region have recently ended, further support is sought but not yet secured; 3. That many countries of the West Eurasia roadmap remain in Stage 1 of the PCP-FMD, and that economic and socio-economic studies to evaluate the impact of FM D are among the typical activities countries should carry out in this Stage; 4. That, when moving into Stage 2 of the PCP-FMD, co untries are required to formulate a strategic risk- based control plan aimed at controlling FMD in target production systems or target areas, and that such strategic plan should possibly describe several opt ions available for national decision making; 5. That strengthening Veterinary Services remains a crucial component for successful implementation of FMD control strategies and that the PCP includes reference to the appropriate PVS critic al competencies related to the prevention and control of diseases; 6. That countries consider that soci oeconomic impact assessm ent of FMD in livestock production, livelihoods and food security have to be carried out as well as cos t/benefit analysis of FMD control options, among other priorities for project proposal preparations; 7. Three FMDV serotypes continue to circulate in the region (A, O, Asia-1), with the ongoing evolution of strains within these serotypes. Of particular concern are the O/PanAsia2/Ant-10 Type A viruses from the SEA-7 lineage and type O viruses from the PanAsia lineage were detected in Eastern Russia, highlighting the threat of incursions of viruses originating in East and South East Asia. The circulation of exotic sub-Saharan viruses (serotypes SAT2, O and A) in Egypt and Libya poses an ongoing threat of spread into the West Eurasia area. 9. There has been a high demand for virus typing in 2012, and clear demonstration of the need for additional laboratory capacity in the Regional and national labor atories in order to provide rapid FMDV typing and vaccine matching services for the countries concerned; 10. Vaccine matching results and vaccine effectiveness studies indicate that vaccines currently used are not protective against all circulating viruses, particularly against serotype Asia-1 and some strains of A Iran 05, and that, in the case of Asia-1, higher potency vaccines ( 6 PD50) are expected to provide better protection; 11. FMD vaccines being used in the region are of gener ally low potency (3 PD50), include vaccines which are not purified in respect of NSP, and are produced by a range of suppliers whose adherence to the quality standards of the OIE and European Pharmacopoeia are uncertain; 12. Diverse vaccination schedules are applied in the region, and in some cases a booster vaccination is not applied to primo-vaccinates which is contrary to the recommendations of most manufacturers; 13. Preventive vaccines of 3PD50 poten cy cannot be expected to prevent all outbreaks, and that additional measures targeted at critical contro l points will be needed if disease and viral circulation is to be prevented; 14. Progression along the PCP-FMD requires a comprehensive understanding of FMD, including epidemiology, virological and socio-economic aspects, and the practical application of this knowledge to develop a control strategy; and countries have requested support to improv e their capacity particularly in epidemiology and socio-economics; 15. That the GF-TADS National Project Proposals Semi nar illustrated that there is need to increase investment in FMD control in the majority of countries in the West Eurasia region; that most countries of the West Eurasia road map have expressed the need to better advocate for support for FMD control with national political de cision makers and their development partners; the importance to consider national control strategies in the context of regional and global approaches; that many countries deemed it necessary to receiv e assistance when formulating project proposals. The issue is of particular relevance in the West Eurasia region, with most of the countries being in Stage 1 of 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 49 the PCP-FMD and moving to Stage 2 which requires a good understanding of FMD epidemiology and the preparation of a risk-based control program; that it is important to harmonize strategies and the preparation of national project proposals for FMD control in the region as much as possible , which will facilitate the understanding amongst potential donors that such national plans are prepar ed in the context of the regional situation and vision. The countries recommend: Completed ( C) On-going ( OG) Not completed ( NC) Recommendations C OG NC On the overall Roadmap approach and PCP-FMD 1. Endorsed the approach and recommended conti nuation of the Roadmap process, with an annual survey to monitor progress; 2. Encouraged OIE/FAO to further develop the guidance on PCP-based project proposals that could assist national authorities to obtain greater national and international investment in FMD control; 3. Welcomed the participation of the Russian Federation in the meeting and encouraged their indication of the support for the Roadmap principles and vision; 4. That countries receive technical support and assistance from International bodies to conduct socioeconomic impact assessments of FMD in livestock production, livelihoods and food security and to conduct cost/benefit analyses of FMD control options; 5. That countries are provided with the necessa ry assistance and training to develop national strategic FMD control plans; 6. That countries that wish to be recognis ed as being in Stage 2 or above should submit the documentation required for formal review of the evidence for completion of the previous Stage, and of the risk based control plans co herent with PCP guidelines, and with evidence of the programme implementation required; 7. That more support be given to national partners to progress on the PCP, and greater emphasis in 2013 on training and guidance on the PCP approach, and strategy development long term planning; 8. That each country identify an FMD Roadmap focal point for communication and that the Roadmap Secretariat send a request to each participating country on this point; 9. That countries get involved actively in t he OIE PVS Pathway to be in compliance with the OIE international standards on quality of Ve terinary Services and that Governmental Authorities support the development of an 'Enabling Environment', of which the reinforcement of Veterinary Services is an integral component. On virus circulation 10. Veterinary Services should reconsider thei r vaccination plans for the coming year, taking note of the continuing epidemic of seroty pe Asia -1 in Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and of serotype A Iran 05 and O Panasia II in at least these same countries; 11. Veterinary Services develop contingency pl ans for the possible introduction of exotic FMDV from other virus pools, including the ri sk of spread of serotype SAT2 from infected parts of the Middle East, and FMDV strains from Pool 1 (China/East Asia) against which vaccines in common use may not protect. On vaccine recommendations 12. Veterinary services should ensure that vaccines used are appropriate for the viruses circulating in the West Eurasia region; the most appropriate vaccines for current risk in the region and recommended for use in 2013 are: for type O, PanAsia2 or O Manisa in combination with O 4625/O 3039; for type A, A Tu r06, A Iran 05, A22 Iraq; for Asia 1, Tur11 or Shamir at a PD50 of 6 or greater. Greate r use should be made of the vaccine matching services offered by Pirbright and FGBI-ARRI AH as FAO/OIE Reference Centres for the region. 13. Vaccines used by countries in the region should comply with the OIE Manual of Standards and in particular, the potency of the vaccines should be selected based on a 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 50 consideration of the level of protection requi red against the main circulating viruses; 14. EuFMD should assist countries to draw up tenders for national vaccine purchase through the provision of a template for tenders that include the recommendations from the Roadmap Meeting, including vaccine strain selection; 15. The WELNET should thoroughly review the minimum potency requirements for vaccines for use in West Eurasia and provide a recomm endation to the next meeting. This analysis should take production capacity and costs into account; 16. In 2013, Asia-1 Shamir vaccine should only be used with a potency of 6PD50; 17. Vaccination schedules and the use of booster vaccination should be reviewed in all countries where FMD cases continue to occur in vaccinated populations; assistance with the design of monitoring in vaccinated populations can be provided by the international organisations; On the FMD monitoring and early warning activities 18. Far greater effort to achieve the rapid sh aring of laboratory information on FMD between the main countries of Pakistan, Iran, Af ghanistan and Turkey, through support to the WELNET and to reference laboratories prov iding vital services to the Roadmap; 19. Greater communication on a regular basis to the 14 countries in the Roadmap, plus their international partners, through a newsletter, bulleti ns or other means to bring attention to new findings/threats to FMD control. On progress along the Roadmap since 2009 20. That the international organisations, and nat ional stakeholders, take note of the progress achieved in parts of the region since 2008, wi th progress of several countries along the pathway; 21. That the 2013 Roadmap be finalized before the end of May , after allowing another month for the missing information to be provided. Recommendations of the West Eurasia FMD Lab Network ( WELNET) 22. Support is provided to WELNET in 2013 to better plan activities and achieve regular communication between the reference and nat ional laboratories in the region; 23. In particular, guidelines should be developed on selection of samples for further characterization by genotyping and vaccine matching, support should be given to sending virus samples from WELNET member states to the SAP Institute, Pirbright and ARRIAH for detailed characterization and rapid result r eporting; and to proficiency testing and improved the networking and communication; 24. Data sharing within the region should be encouraged, including the use of the EMPRES-i database to assist prioritizing laboratory activities, risk management and early threat detection. Recommendations of the Epi-Network 25. Organize a second round of training courses in Practical Epidemiology for Progressive Control (PEPc) in 2013, to be organised by Eu FMD in consultation with FAO and OIE, open to countries and projects in the West Eurasia region according to funding; 26. That the Epi-Network produces a comprehe nsive review of the epidemiology of FMD in West Eurasia, to summarise the findings and lesson s learnt in the first 5 years (since 2008); 27. That a review of vaccination strategies against FMD, covering the range of current programmes in use in the region, be developed and a training workshop(s) organised in vaccination programme development, monitoring and evaluation. Recommendations of the GF-TADS National Project Proposals Seminar 28. On Advocacy: International and regional or ganizations (also in light of the Global FMD Strategy document) assist to any possible extent national veteri nary authorities in their effort to advocate FMD control as one of the prio rity issues in the livestock sector; 29. On Support for formulation of project proposals: that count ries receive adequate assistance from international bodies when app roaching such strategic issues and that national project proposals should be formulated in an harmonized manner. The use of a tool such as the Logical Framework approach coul d be a possible guide although it is recognized that appropriate flexibility is necessary in or der to adjust with national uses and needs. 5th West Eurasia FMD Roadmap, Astana / Kazakhstan, April 2014 51 Annex 5 Survey on vaccination conducted in the context of the W. Eurasia ROADMAP MEETING Vaccination against FMD in West Eurasia (in 2013 +/- early 2014) (replies received from 10 out of 14 countries , namely Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan and Turkey) Results FMD cases were reported in 2013 in 5 of the 10 countrie s. Causative serotypes were A, O and Asia1. The FMD vaccination strategy varies considerably betw een countries. Vaccination is compulsory for large ruminants (LR) in 8/10 countries, and compulsory for sm all ruminants (SR) in 7/10 countries. Seven out of 10 countries have mass vaccination campaigns for LR, mostly twice per year, and 6/10 countries have mass vaccination campaigns for SR once or twice per year. Ring vaccination around outbreaks is performed in 7/10 countries.

Thirteen different suppliers were identified that provide vaccine to the countries (Merial, MSD In tervet, Russia, Czech Republic, India, national (Turkey, Iran, Kazakhstan, Pakistan)). At leas t 3 different vaccine strains were used for each serotype Table 2: Vaccine strains used in W. Eurasia in 2013, for each serotype Serotype 0 Manisa, O-3039 A 05 Georgia2001 Methods reported for monitoring vaccination were: serologi cal surveys (6 countries), telephone (2 countries), records (2 countries), random farm visits (2 countrie s) outbreak investigation (1 country) and clinical surveillance (1 country). Vaccine matching for circulat ing field strains was reported from only 4/10 countries. Conclusions: The survey demonstrated a large variation in FMD vacc ination practices in West Eurasia. Most countries are following the recommendations put forward at the la st Roadmap meeting in terms of strain selection. There are a number of areas where technica l assistance may be appropriate including as: \u2014 Selection of FMD control policies / vaccination strategies (particularly those based on risk assessements). \u2014 Vaccine matching -strain selection \u2014 Post-vaccination monitoring 05 00010 000 00045 000 000vaccine dosesVaccine doses used in 2013 cattle doses 2013 SR doses 2013 "}
