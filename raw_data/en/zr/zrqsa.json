Dierent preventive eorts have been undertaken in responseto this global health predicament; amongst them, vaccine development is at the forefront. Severalsophisticated designs have been applied to create a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and 44 candidateshave already entered clinical trials. At present, it is unclear which ones will meet the objectives ofe\u0000ciency and safety, though several vaccines are gearing up to obtain emergency approval in theU.S. and Europe. This manuscript discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various vaccineplatforms and evaluates the safety and e\u0000cacy of vaccines in advance stages. Once a vaccine isdeveloped, the next challenge will be acquisition, deployment, and uptake. The present manuscriptdescribes these challenges in detail and proposes solutions to the vast array of translational challenges.It is evident from the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 that the virus will remain a threat to everybodyas long as the virus is still circulating in a few.

BackgroundThe continued unabated spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 disease poses asignicant threat to human health. This condition is driven by the di\u0000culty in containing the virusand by the non-availability of vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we review the strategies appliedand the progress made in the development of e\u0000cient and safe vaccines. It is vitally important tostrategize the procurement and introduction of vaccines once they are created and medically approved.We project solutions to overcome some of the translational hurdles and propose strategies for theglobal deployment of vaccines. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, WHO, andCDC websites, as well as vaccine manufacturers' websites, for updated developments to formulatethis comprehensive review.2. IntroductionThe pandemic caused by the newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus has propagated sociological,psychological, and economic crises around the globe. Extensive measures such as widespreadtesting and strict isolation of infected individuals is necessary to impede further spreading; however,implementing these containment procedures poses a signicant challenge. The virus is responsible formore than 64 million conrmed cases globally with more than 1.487 million deaths as of 2 December2020 [1]. The continued spread of this coronavirus (CoV) of global 7392 of 16developing vaccines and therapeutics. A COVID-19 vaccine that provides some degree of immuneprotection could allow lockdowns and social distancing to be relaxed. There are no vaccines provenyet to protect humans against the virus. Around 44 dierent coronavirus vaccines are currently underclinical trials in order to determine their e\u0000cacy and safety prole [2].This paper is distinct from other published review articles on COVID-19 vaccines throughits comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of vaccine candidates developed usingdierent technological approaches, the e\u0000cacy and safety of the various candidate vaccines,and anticipated challenges beyond vaccine development, such as vaccine acceptance, acquisition,and global deployment.3. SARS-CoV-2 BiologySARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus and is genetically close to othercoronavirus (CoV) strains such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [3]. Bats serve as a natural reservoir forall three of these viruses [3]. Infection of humans likely occurred through intermediate hosts, such aspangolins in the case of SARS-CoV-2 [4]. Being RNA viruses, CoVs readily evolve by mutation andhomologous and non-homologous recombination, which expand their host range.CoVs are spherical in shape with characteristic club-like projections on the surface, which arereferred to as \"spikes\". The virus membrane contains four structural components, namely the spike(S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Figure1). The (S) protein facilitatesbinding to the trans-membrane angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 host receptor in SARS-CoV-2;(S) protein is the primary determinant for host transmissibility and pathogenicity [5-7] and is the maintarget for neutralizing antibodies, and therefore is considered as a primary target for vaccine design [8]. Figure 1.Portraying the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),mode of virus transmission, non-vaccine prevention strategies, and potential vaccine candidates thathave progressed to clinical trials.

Analysis of the receptorbinding motif (RBM) in the spike protein showed that most of the amino acid residues essentialfor receptor binding were conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the 2CoV strains use the same host receptor for cell entry [11]. The virus spike protein is a trimericmultidomain glycoprotein that is able to specically recognize ACE2 via its receptor binding domain(RBD). The conformational changes induced by the RBD/ACE2 interactions ultimately result in viraland cellular lipid membrane fusion and hence in cell infection. The RBD and ACE2 represent idealtargets to counteract the SARS-CoV-2 infection [12]. Homann et al. investigated if SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV infection of target cells and spread throughoutthe host. Researchers found that the binding a\u0000nity of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to its target ACE2on human cells is markedly higher than the spike from the SARS virus from 2002 [14].Importation of this new coronavirus to a na\u00efve population may explain the profuse seeding ofCOVID-19 at the \"epicenters\", where spatial closeness facilitates rampant transmission. Viral titersare highest in the earliest phases of infection [15]. The ability for asymptomatic individuals to stillshed the virus provides a likely explanation for the high infection rate [16,17]. A key factor in thetransmissibility of COVID-19 is the high level of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tractcompared to SARS-CoV-1, where replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract [18]. Recentstudies suggest that the newly evolved G614 strain is 3-9 times more infective than the old strainD614 [19,20].SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily though droplets, i.e., respiratory secretions and saliva. Thereare reports of transmission in the absence of clear symptoms [21,22]. Recently, the possibility ofshort-range aerosol spreading of virus has been emphasized [23,24]. However, the larger droplets fromcoughs and sneezes are still the primary source of infection [25]. The risk of infection increases thelonger and closer a person is to someone who has the virus, and poorly ventilated enclosed crowdedspaces are riskier than the outdoors. Some studies have suggested a link between the amount of virusexposure and the severity of illness [26,27], though the evidence of this remains inconclusive, as theseverity of disease is more likely to be dependent on the individual's immune system.Many patients that contracted SARS-CoV-2 and developed severe disease have comorbiditieslike diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and immunocompromised conditions [28-30]. Older peopleare likely to have damaged lungs due to smoking, inhaling polluted air particles, and weakenedimmunity, making them more susceptible to infection. Younger adults are also being hospitalized inthe U.S. and elsewhere. Infected children appear to be less symptomatic and may act as carriers ofviral infection [31].5. The Host's Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2A recent study demonstrated that antibodies generated in asymptomatic individuals tend to fadeaway in two to three months [32,33]. Antibodies are a critical component of immunity\u2014especially theones that \"neutralize\" the virus. A good vaccine will try to replicate that kind of natural protection.Measuring both humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is vital for vaccine development.Grifoni et al. provided critical knowledge that showed circulating SARS-CoV-2-specic CD8+andCD4+T cells were identied in ~70 and 100% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. CD4+T cellresponses to the S protein were robust and correlated with the magnitude of the anti-SARS-CoV-2IgG and IgA titers. Interestingly, T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 pooled epitopes was also detectedin non-exposed individuals, indicating possible cross-reactivity with other CoVs that are commonlycirculating in the population [34]. In another study, memory T cells were found in individualsVaccines2020,8, 7394 of 16who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection [35]. Ni et al. found a correlation between neutralizingantibody titers and the numbers of virus-specic [36]. individuals or mild COVID-19 [37], who are showing positive serostatus. Whether such a responsecould prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 is yet to be proven. In a recent study, robust Tcell responses to SARS-CoV-2 to spike protein and as well as to nucleoprotein and membrane proteinshave been shown to persist at least for six months after even mild or asymptomatic infection [38].This provides evidence that T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may last longer than antibody immunity.However, the critical question remains whether these persistent T cells provide e\u0000cient protectionagainst re-infection. Interestingly, T cell reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 has been described in non-exposedindividuals indicating possible cross-reactivity with other CoVs that are commonly circulating inthe human population [39]. Other studies reported generation of putative cross-reactive responsesbetween SARS-CoV-2 and pneumococcal individualsthat previously received pneumococcal or DTP [40,41]. The role of this cross-reactivity inprotection or immunopathology has not yet been dened.Immune responses, such as marked inflammatory responses, develop after infection withSARS-CoV-2 [42]. This condition is associated with signicant synthesis of various proinflammatorycytokines and chemokines [43,44]. These observations are consistent with the possible induction ofinnate immune responsiveness in infected persons. A recent study by Carsetti et al. demonstrated thata high frequency of natural killer cells and early increases in IgA, IgM, and IgG are associated withasymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, while high levels of monocyte induction and persistent levelsof IgA and IgG produced in late stages of infection characterize severe disease. This suggests thatonly severe COVID-10 disease may result in protective memory established by an adaptive immuneresponse [45].Recent studies demonstrate the induction of cytokine storms by SARS-CoV-2 [46], and thatpersistent pro-inflammatory responses that progress to cytokine hyperactivation (cytokinestorm) appear to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and further organ injury in asubset of COVID-19 patients [47]. We previously postulated a similar role of cytokine storms inadvanced pneumonia in H5N1 influenza and proposed development of therapeutic vaccines directedat diminishing the cytokine storm [48].Severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is marked by dysregulation in innate immune cells,and recent studies suggest that some of the immune responder cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 infectionmay be partially activated or altogether dysfunctional [49]. Furthermore, recent literature suggeststhat CoV can manipulate interferon (IFN) responses; eective innate immune responses against viralinfection are heavily dependent on IFN responses (and the downstream pathways) that control viralreplication as well as the tapping of the adaptive arm of the immune system. Of note, structuralproteins of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to act as IFN antagonists [50].Scientists are still grappling with the issue of coronavirus and immunity. Never in the historyof public health has herd immunity been recommended as a strategy for responding to an outbreak,let alone in a pandemic against a novel respiratory virus. Herd immunity is a flawed goal without avaccine, as many infectious conditions never reach that point, e.g., measles, malaria, AIDS, and flu.If the evidence of increasing reinfection is conrmed, it is unlikely that we would ever reach herdimmunity against SARS-CoV-2.Researchers have been looking to understand how immunity to the new virus might work andhow to design a vaccine. The role of T or B cells in asymptomatic, symptomatic, cured, or re-infectedindividuals has not been thoroughly investigated. We do not know if repeated infections are requiredto develop sustained immunity. Further studies into the immune evasion mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2could be vital for e\u0000cacious vaccine development. While the role of the innate immune response inmemory immunity is not well understood, further studies into the innate immune response wouldhelp design eective vaccines that target and hamper viral components that dysregulate the innateVaccines2020,8, 7395 of 16immune response or aid in immune evasion mechanisms. Further investigation into to these unknownaspects of host immunity will explain mechanisms of protection and aid in dening protectioncorrelates, which are essential to validate any vaccine's utility in a pandemic. A good vaccine responseis characterized by the robust induction of humoral and cell-mediated immunity, as well as thestimulation of the innate immune system (using adjuvants or other mechanisms) to further drive theadaptive response.6. Vaccine Development Platforms for SARS-CoV-2Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, though researchis happening at breakneck speed, and signicant progress has been made toward this goal.About 240 vaccines are in early development, with 44 in clinical trials and nine already in thenal stage of testing on thousands of people (Figure1). Vaccines normally take years to develop,yet researchers hope to achieve the same goal in only a few months. Most experts think a vaccine islikely to become widely available by mid-2021, about 12-18 months after the new virus rst emerged.It is worth noting that four coronaviruses already commonly circulate in human beings. They causecommon cold symptoms, and we do not have vaccines for any of them. The goal should be to produce asafe and highly eective COVID-19 vaccine; vaccination with just 70 or 75 percent e\u0000cacy can dampenthe outbreak. For example, the flu vaccine is not 100 percent eective but is still benecial.Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are likely to target the viral S protein, due to its vital role in viralinfectivity. Other viral proteins such as the N protein, E protein, and non-structural protein 16 (NSP16)could also be considered as targets for vaccine development. In view of the lower mutation ratesand relatively conserved sequences of the coronavirus N gene, it could be another useful target forvaccines and diagnostics. Epitope characterization of the structural protein NP-specic T cells showedrecognition of protein fragments with low homology to common cold human coronaviruses butconserved amongst betacoranaviruses [51]. The best-case scenario would be the development of auniversal vaccine that can be given only once. Such a vaccine would provide protection against all, orat least most, of the many strains of SARS-CoV-2, including future pandemic coronaviruses.There is an urgent need to develop animal models that mimic the natural infection in humans.Vaccines need to be tested in animal models for their safety and e\u0000cacy. Some of the candidate vaccineshave been tested in monkeys; however, they do not develop the severe symptoms that SARS-CoV-2causes in humans.The vaccine platforms used to develop anti-SARS-CoV-2 include live attenuated vaccines,inactivated whole-virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus particle mRNA-basedvaccines, DNA-based vaccines, and viral vector-based vaccines [52]. Each method has dierentstrengths and weaknesses, which are summarized in Table1.The main method of vaccination for decades has been to use the original virus, attenuated byvarious methods, as it often produces long-lasting immunity. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)vaccine is made by using weakened viruses that cannot cause a full-blown infection. Some scientists,particularly those in China, are using this approach.An alternative method to using the whole virus is to pick a specic protein, protein fragment, orsubunit of a pathogen to create a vaccine. Vaccines can also be developed by using VLPs, which are asort of intermediate between protein subunits and inactivated or attenuated viruses. Researchers atthe University of Queensland, in Australia, have developed a \"molecular clamp\" technique, whichhelps the viral proteins retain their shape, enabling the immune system to mount a much strongerimmune response.Vaccines2020,8, 7396 of 16Table 1.Vaccine development platforms against SARS-CoV-2, their viral targets, manufacturing description, advantages, and disadvantages.(A) Vaccine Type (B) Target (C) Description (D) Advantages (E) LimitationsLive attenuated Whole virusLive viruses are weakened to reduce virulence, selected bygrowth in heterologous species and/or in tissue culture cells.Induction of strong B and T cell responsesRisk for infection remains due to genetic reversion.

For mRNA-based vaccines,a synthetic version of the mRNA that a virus uses to build its infectious proteins is delivered into thehuman body, whose cells read it as instructions to build that virus' proteins. The immune systemdetects those proteins and induces an immune response against the virus. DNA vaccine platforms usea circular DNA plasmid, coding for some antigen protein, engineered with strong promoter signals andstop signals at both ends of the sequence. There is no licensed human vaccine that uses nucleic acids.Viral vector-based vaccines use virus like adenovirus or vaccinia virus to carry DNA into humancells. The DNA contained in the virus encodes antigens that, once expressed in the infected humancells, elicit an immune response.Both DNA and mRNA methods have several potential advantages over traditional vaccines, but asignicant one is the speed at which a candidate vaccine can be created [53,54]. Having known thegenetic sequence of the new coronavirus, it was possible to develop a vaccine within a few weeks.There is another approach that is sometimes called \"plug-and-play\"; DNA or RNA from a large numberof germs can be \"plugged\" into the same vaccine platform [55].7. Vaccines in Advanced StageThe vaccines that are considered to be front-runners include the following: Sino Biotech'sCoronaVac, which is an inactivated a viral vector V, which is is a DNA plasmid vaccine.CoronaVac is an inactivated vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech. Preliminary resultsdemonstrated that the vaccine generated antibodies capable of neutralizing 10 strains ofSARS-CoV-2 [56]. Results from Sinovac's phase two human trials also seem promising; the biotechcompany has released preprint results that showed the vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies withno severe adverse reactions. They are currently gearing up to conduct phase three trials in Brazil,Indonesia, and Bangladesh.Recent preliminary data from Pzer and BioNTech suggest that the vaccine is 95% eective basedon 170 cases of COVID-19 developing in volunteers. Of note, eight individuals were in the groupgiven the vaccine. The companies Pzer and BioNTech said that the vaccine's e\u0000cacy was consistentacross age, race, and ethnicity. The most common serious adverse event was fatigue, with 3.7 percentof volunteers reporting tiredness after they took the second dose. Two percent of volunteers reported aheadache after the second dose. Older adults reported fewer and milder side eects, the companiessaid. Although the full trial data are not yet published, both companies have stated their intent toapply for authorization for emergency use of the vaccines in the U.S.Moderna's mRNA vaccine candidate injects coronavirus' genetic information into a non-virulentviral vector, which then creates viral proteins that mimic the coronavirus. To date, mRNA vaccines havenot been licensed for use, though preliminary results of Moderna's trials show promise. If approved,both the mRNA-based vaccines made by Moderna and by Pzer and BioNTech would be the rstof its kind. Vaccination of nonhuman primates with the vaccine induced antibody levels exceedingthose in human convalescent-phase serum and produced type 1 helper T-cell (Th1)-biased low to no Th2 T-cell responses [57].Recent studies demonstrate that the mRNA vaccine manufactured by Moderna can stimulate theproduction of antibodies, which are able to neutralize the virus in laboratory samples [57,58]. It wouldbe a big breakthrough if the same eects could be replicated in larger human trials and demonstratethat the immune response induced by the vaccine is strong enough to protect humans from developingCOVID-19 pathogenesis. This vaccine requires two doses, four weeks apart. There remain concernsregarding the severe side eects experienced by a small number of participants who were given theVaccines2020,8, 7398 of 16highest dose of the vaccine. While phase two results are still being monitored, Moderna announcedthat it started phase three trials in 30,000 U.S. participants. Interim trial results released by Modernasuggest that their vaccine induced similar protection levels as the vaccine produced by Pzer andBionTech. The biotech company is poised to manufacture up to one billion doses a year since partneringwith the Swiss manufacturer Lonza.Similarly, a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response was detected in both nonhuman primatesand in humans when researchers tested another leading mRNA vaccine named BNT162b, which ismanufactured by Pzer in conjunction with German Biotech company BioNTech [59,60]. Like theModerna vaccine, this one also produces T-cell responses specic to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and willsoon start phase three trials to include 44,000 people across several countries. Pzer is gearing up toprovide 100 million doses through a contract with the U.S. government, which goes into eect whenand if the drug is approved.Researchers at Oxford University in conjunction with AstraZeneca, CanSino Biologics, and Johnson& Johnson all are using adenovirus vector-based vaccine platforms to make COVID-19 vaccines. In thistechnology, research teams have transferred the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein into a weakened version ofan adenovirus. When this adenovirus is injected into humans, the hope is that the spike protein willtrigger an immune response.CanSino Biologics is using the Ad-5 vector, whereas Johnson & Johnson is using the Ad-26vector. The former vector infects populations in many parts of the world, and the later one is lessprevalent; however, it is present in Sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of Asia. The adenovirus used increating a COVID-19 vaccine by the Oxford lab is a nonhuman adenovirus vector obtained from fecesof Chimpanzee, dubbed ChAdOx1. Preliminary results from the University of Oxford's ChAdOx1vaccine candidate's clinical trial revealed that the vaccine could induce a potent antibody and T-cellresponse with only minor side eects such as headache and fatigue [61,62].On 8 September, AstraZeneca paused clinical trials due to an adverse reaction in one of the trialparticipants. The details of the reaction remain unknown; however, following a thorough investigationby an independent party, the trials resumed in the U.K., Brazil, South Africa, and India but haveremained on hold in the U.S. as of 23 September. AstraZeneca and Oxford have announced their plansto produce a billion doses of vaccine, which the manufacturers have said will be sold at cost.Johnson & Johnson went on to develop multiple Ad26-based vaccines for viruses like HIV, Zika,and Ebola. The Ebola vaccine regimen uses a shot of an Ad26-based vaccine plus a booster shot of adierent vaccine. That combination used by Johnson & Johnson makes it hard to draw comparisons toits COVID-19 vaccine, which uses only Ad26. A study published inNatureshowed that the vaccineelicited neutralizing antibodies in monkeys and provided \"complete or near-complete\" protectionwith just one dose. The Johnson & Johnson trial is the biggest trial of the vaccine that we knowof\u201460,000 adults from a variety of countries. The trial includes \"signicant representation\" from olderpopulations. As of 12 October 2020, Johnson & Johnson has temporarily paused all COVID-19 vaccinecandidate clinical trials, including the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, due to an unexplained illness in astudy participant. While a few pauses are expected in trials involving large numbers of participants,concerns arise when serious adverse events are increasingly occurring. U.S. regulators have now giventhe green light to resume the trials of both the vaccines produced by AstraZeneca and Johnson &Johnson. Both these manufacturers have contracts to provide their vaccines to the U.S. government ifapproved by regulators.CanSino has also developed a viral vector vaccine, which expresses and introduces the SARS-CoV-2spike protein to the body. Preliminary reports published inThe Lancetare promising and demonstratethe induction of a signicant immune response after only one immunization [63,64]. No seriousadverse eects have been documented. The Chinese government has approved the vaccine for militaryuse only.Petrovax, a Russian biopharmaceutical company, announced the start of phase three trials for theirAd5-nCoV vaccine on 15 August. The vaccine was made by the Gamaleya National Center and usesVaccines2020,8, 7399 of 16two strains of adenovirus 5. The vaccine is comprised of two injections; the second is given after 21days to boost the immune response. O\u0000cials with the institute state that they have completed phasesone and two studies and that they have seen robust antibody and cellular immune responses. After lessthan two months of testing, Russian o\u0000cials have given the vaccine regulatory approval. Promisingresults from trials of the COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik, reportedly show 92% protection; though unlikeother researchers, this group has not released any data on safety or e\u0000cacy, which makes it di\u0000cult forindependent assessment.Adenovirus-based COVID-19 programs have garnered global attention for their scale and speed.Yet questions arise whether they can overcome their checkered past. Since adenoviral vectors are basedon natural viruses that some of us might already have been exposed to, responses to the vaccines mightbe misdirected. Another concern is the dose of the vaccine; if the dose required to illicit an eectiveimmune response is high, the result could be adenovirus-induced heightened inflammation, whichwould send the immune system into overdrive. To keep inflammation under control, the vaccinesmight have to be administered at low doses and with an adjuvant. Some vaccine experts opined thatadministering the vaccines as nasal sprays or pills may help in circumventing preexisting immunity toAd5 in the bloodstream.While most vaccine scientists agree that adenoviral vector vaccines are great at spurring T-cellimmunity, we do not know how important that will be for preventing COVID-19 in humans. Mostresearch has focused on the immune system's antibody response to the virus. Adenoviral vectorvaccines can induce antibody responses, but not as strong as those elicited by more traditional vaccines.Inovio's INO4800 is a DNA plasmid; two cellular candidates from Shenzhen Geno-ImmuneMedical Institute include LV-SMENP-DC, a dendritic cell vaccine that has been modied with lentivirusvectors to express viral proteins, and an articial antigen-presenting cell (aAPC) vaccine along thesame lines.It has recently been reported that DNA vaccines are able to elicit measurable immune responsesin immunized animals [65] and in humans in initial trials [66] that could lead to protection againstSARS-CoV-2. Further studies are to be pursued to determine their e\u0000cacies and safety in largerhuman trials.The standardization of endpoints is critical to eectively compare results across dierent studies.In the case of the current pandemic, endpoints of both nonclinical and clinical trials have already beendened by the FDA; however, it is up to the manufacturer whether to follow the FDA's guidance or not.Currently, laboratory conrmed SARS-CoV-1, symptomatic COVID-19 infection, or a combination ofthe two are described as acceptable primary endpoints for vaccine e\u0000cacy trials [67]. There has beenmuch discussion around whether or not the right endpoints are being studied [68], and if primary andsecondary endpoints should dier by vaccine type [69]. Of note, the most important e\u0000cacy endpoint,protection against severe disease and death, is di\u0000cult to assess in phase 3 clinical trials [70].Validity of a candidate vaccine should be assessed by an evaluation of humoral, cellular, andfunctional immune responses as appropriate to each of the included COVID-19 antigens. Measurementof cellular responses should be assessed by CD8+and CD4+T cell responses. The functional activityof immune responses should be testedin vitroin neutralization assays using either wild-type virus orpseudovirus. True e\u0000cacy could be determined via challenge infections; however, the ethics of thisprocess have been questioned in the absence of a cure. Once this step has been carried out, the clinicalsigns need to be monitored for signs of protection or unintended toxic eects. Post-vaccination animalchallenge studies and the determination of the type of nonclinical and clinical immune responsesinduced by the particular COVID-19 vaccine candidate can be used to ascertain the likelihood of thevaccine to induce vaccine-associated respiratory pathology in humans. A candidate vaccine againstSARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducingany of these elements could contribute to disease control [71]. A vaccine, whether fully or partiallyprotective, would lead to lowering the \"R\" value (viral reproduction number), thus diminishing theviral spread.Vaccines2020,8, 73910 of 16Recent reports described that several COVID-19 vaccines in early trials stimulated a robustantibody response in vaccinated subjects. However, we do not know how much immunity they provideand for how long, and if they will protect humans against the virus in challenging infections. All thedevelopers asserted that their vaccines elicited antibody levels like those seen in patients who haverecovered from COVID-19. Of note, the antibody responses in convalescing patients varied widely,and that even matching those responses did not necessarily guarantee any degree of immunity.Some developed countries, including the U.S.A. and U.K., have secured access to three othervaccines, namely Sano and GlaxoSmithKline's protein adjuvant vaccine, Valneva's virus vaccine VLA2001. These vaccines weredeveloped by leveraging manufacturers' already proven vaccine technologies. They are in the earlystages of clinical trials, and preliminary data show promise; however, data on the e\u0000ciency and safetyare yet to be published.The immune responses elicited by sub-potent vaccines may exert selection pressure for theemergence of a mutated virus. Emergence of novel subtypes with antigenic changes could be achallenge for COVID-19 vaccine developers. It is thought that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has mutatedrelatively slowly so far\u2014especially compared with other RNA viruses like HIV and influenza. However,a recent report has shown that mutations have made a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus, called G614,which has almost completely replaced the rst version to spread in Europe and the U.S., which iscalled D614 [19]. Current vaccines being tested mostly target the spike protein, but they were madeusing older strains of the virus. It seems important to evaluate whether the newly mutated virus canbe controlled by the vaccines that are under development.8. Enhancing the Immune Response to a VaccineFor some vaccines, a boosting protocol may be required to induce su\u0000cient immunity,and appropriate vaccine adjuvants may be required to generate a su\u0000cient immune response or fordose sparing. CpG 1018, MF59\u00ae, and AS03 are already approved for human vaccines, and theirinclusion may expedite COVID-19 vaccine development process. One adjuvant, Protollin, inducesboth systemic and mucosal immune responses that could be evaluated in COVID-19 vaccines [72].Small molecule toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonists have demonstrated potential as vaccineadjuvants, since they directly activate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and can enhance both humoraland cellular immune responses, especially TH1 responses [73]. Other potential technologies mightinvolve self-adjuvating recombinant Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), using dierent formulations of live bacteria, may have varyingdegrees of immune boosting ability. It is possible that BCG gives a bit of extra strength to the humanimmune system by e\u0000ciently bridging the innate immunity with the adaptive immunity encounteringSARS-CoV-2. After abating multiple confounding factors, signicant associations between BCGvaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed [74]. Countries with universal BCGvaccinations, such as Japan and South Korea, have infection and disease rates of COVID-19 as much as100-fold lower than countries without universal vaccination policies, such as Italy, the Netherlands,and the United States. The elderly, who were vaccinated decades ago, may particularly benet.9. Translational ChallengesIt is important to investigate whether vaccines confer full or partial protection, if this varies withthe age, whether the vaccinated individuals are protected from recurrent infections, and, if immunized,whether people would need boosting (which would necessitate the manufacturing of billions ofadditional doses). Earlier animal experiments with vaccines against the related coronaviruses that causeSARS-1 and MERS demonstrated that low antibody levels could lead to aberrant immune responses.Some antibodies against the SARS-CoV-1 spike may mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)of infection [75]. There could also be cell-based enhancement, a category that includes allergicinflammation caused by Th2 immunopathology following vaccination [76].Vaccines2020,8, 73911 of 16Critical potency testing, standardization, and quality control of vaccines are required to determinethe level of immune responses the vaccines generate. With the recent development of new technologies,vaccine manufacturing is not as di\u0000cult as proving that a vaccine is safe and eective. Anotherchallenge is testing the vaccine, because this requires that people who volunteered for trials are infected.The experimental method of giving people the vaccine and then deliberately infecting them (challengeinfection) could give quicker answers. The concern is that this process is too dangerous at this stageto infect individuals in the absence of a cure. Some vaccine developers like to adopt the Goldilocksapproach for challenge infection. This would require enough virus to infect them, but not so muchthat it might overwhelm their immune system. Another option would be to give challenge infectionwith less virulent viruses if available. However, this may not mimic the natural infection process norexclude the risk of disease following a challenge infection.If a vaccine is developed, then there will be a limited supply, at least initially, so it will be importantto prioritize recipient groups. Deciding on priority groups will be a di\u0000cult task in the case ofCOVID-19 because of the high rate of infection and mortality. Healthcare workers who encounterCOVID-19 patients would top the list. The disease is most deadly in older people, so they would alsobe a priority if the vaccine is eective in this age group.Production capacity could be a critical limitation to the deployment of pandemic vaccine globally.Some labs and pharmaceutical companies already are setting up plans to scale up production oncemedical authorities approve the vaccines. Prior discussion and fore planning are required to meet thehuge logistical challenge of immunizing most of the world's population. As in any pandemic, publicand private sectors must mobilize to produce and distribute vaccines, if one is available, as quicklyas possible.Many of the vaccines being developed require two doses in order to be eective. For a worldpopulation of 7 billion, marked up-scaling of the manufacturing process is therefore required toproduce double the vaccine doses. Not all vaccine technologies, especially those that are showing themost promising results in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, have been applied for such a largescalemanufacturing before.Some vaccines also require special devices to be used. There are some DNA-based vaccines indevelopment that require an electroporation device for each dose. It uses a device the size of an electrictoothbrush to generate a small electrical current that opens holes in the membrane of a cell, allowinga vaccine to enter. Although the device can be used multiple times, it is nonetheless an additionalchallenge in order to ensure there are a su\u0000cient number of these.There are questions around raw materials\u2014both for the vaccine and glass vials\u2014and refrigeratorcapacity. AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2\u0000C and8\u0000C. Some other candidate vaccines may need an ultra-cold chain\u2014storage at\u000060\u0000C or colder beforebeing diluted and distributed. This can be an immense task where infrastructure is weak and electricitysupply and refrigeration is unstable. The WHO, UNICEF, and M\u00e9decins Sans Frontieres (MSF/DoctorsWithout Borders) already have eective vaccination programs in places around the world. Of note,developed countries have a strong cold-chain infrastructure, but many African countries and someAsian countries could face challenges in this regard. The procurement of vaccines and supply chainlogistics will pose signicant challenges due the unprecedented scale and nature of the virus.Of note, the key to a successful immunization program is acceptance by the public. Without thiscritical piece, future public health responses would be crippled. Vaccine hesitancy sentiments posea growing problem that have become embroiled in anti-mask, anti-lockdown ideologies. If cohortsof people refuse to have the vaccine, do we leave them to fend for themselves or have mandatoryvaccination for children to go to schools, or for stain care homes? There are many di\u0000cult questions.Transparency and regular reporting concerning safety and e\u0000cacity of vaccines under developmentmay ensure the creation of trust and acceptance in vaccines.Though a medically approved vaccine is not available yet, this is the time to formulate strategiesfor eective distribution and vaccine administration for each country. It is important to involveVaccines2020,8, 73912 of 16stakeholders from each country to ensure the individualized strategies are feasible. Vaccine acquisition,distribution, and uptake issues are substantially dierent in the developing world.The WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance ofgovernments and organizations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing eld. At least 80 rich nationsand economies, so far, have signed up for the global vaccine plan known as Covax, which aims to raise$2 billion by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.One important aspect for implementing COVID-19 vaccination programs in low-income countriesis the cost. High cost of vaccines has limited HPV vaccination in Sub-Saharan countries [77]. We needaordable vaccines that are produced in su\u0000cient quantity for use in every corner of the world.10. ConclusionsThe idea of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a fast-spreading pandemic has great allure. The sheervariety of the novel types of vaccines being investigated and the approaches they use, whatever formthat takes, could serve us well for future outbreaks of other novel diseases.At this point, it remains unclear how eective a COVID-19 vaccine will be, and if it will consist ofa one-time vaccination or be seasonal, like the flu vaccine. Even if a promising vaccine surfaces by 2021and can be mass-produced, the search will not end there. We are likely to need more than one vaccineto meet global demand.Of importance, if SARS-CoV-2 remains a threat to a few, it will remain a threat to everybody.Politics and private interests should not hamper vaccine development and deployment eorts.This behemoth undertaking must be achieved through altruistic partnerships between industry,governments, and international organizations for the universal benet of human health.Author Contributions:A.H. conceived the concept and design of the paper.
