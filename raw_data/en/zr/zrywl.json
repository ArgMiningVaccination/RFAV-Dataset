Naturopathy Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as \"natural\", \"non-invasive\", and as promoting \"self-healing\". The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine. Allopathy Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is a term which refers to science-based, modern medicine, such as the use of medications or surgery to treat or suppress symptoms or the ill effects of disease. There are regional variations in usage of the term. Differences between the Two Naturopathic medicine promotes wellness and prevention. The emphasis of naturopathic therapies is to treat the causes of disease and to stimulate the healing power of body by using natural techniques and therapies. Naturopathic doctors diagnose and treat both acute and chronic conditions and treat patients of all ages. For chronic ailments, the Allopathic system of medicine has not proven to be too good. Allopathy can only manage the disease. It can never really uproot the disease because essentially, it is about symptomatic treatment. The biggest difference between naturopathy and allopathy is that the allopathic physician tends to view good health, as a physical state in which there is no obvious disease present. In contrast, naturopathic physicians recognize true health as an optimal state of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well being. Naturopathy or \"nature cure\" is a method of healing that employs various natural means to empower an individual to achieve the highest possible level of health. Naturopathy draws on the healing wisdom of many countries, including India, China, and Greece. Allopathic medicine is also known as conventional, mainstream, traditional, orthodox, modern medicine. It involves mostly drugs, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as treatment modalities. Naturopathic physicians provide recommendations on lifestyle, diet, and exercise. A naturopathic doctor tends to use treatments designed to enhance the immune system, while most allopathic doctors tend to use treatments designed to kill the infecting organism. Naturopathic medicine addresses the cause, whereby allopathic medicine treats the symptoms. Allopathic physicians have long been obsessed with the agent that causes infection rather than with the immune system of the patient. You can see that both allopathic and naturopathic medicines have advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses. Yet through the clarification of the two viewpoints, you can understand how they can be complementary to each other or at times one will be better suited to a condition than the other. Your understanding is the key to making the best choice for building your own health. - Dr. Reetu Panwar Get in touch with Dr. Reetu Panwar - +91 - 95607 39885 For detailed understanding of your problem, you can also visit the clinic - Holistic Healing Point.
