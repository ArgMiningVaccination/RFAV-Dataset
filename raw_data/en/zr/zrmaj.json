Manufactured by the United States of America-based ModernaTX Inc, this RNA (mRNA) vaccine is the fourth vaccine available in India, after Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik.

This vaccine is also approved by the European Medicine Agency, making it part of the list of vaccines that will enable its beneficiaries to get the Covid-19 vaccination passport for travelling to Europe.
