As aromatherapy massage is massage therapy enhanced with essential oils, these oils are absorbed through the skin and through inhalation, hence creating beneficial changes in the mind and body by affecting the limbic system.

MASSAGE OILS VERSUS LOTIONS IN DAILY SKIN-CARE ROUTINE Whether we should use massage oil instead of lotions in our daily skincare routine is very much debatable. To start off with, the biggest misconception about oils for the skin is our assumption that it is too oily and that we will end up feeling and looking greasy before we actually put it into use. If you spend more time to massage body oils into your skin, it will get absorbed easily without the greasy feeling. And another untrue fact is that it clogs our pores. Do bear in mind that hydration is crucial especially in colder and drier weather or rather very dependable on age factor. But we need to make choices, the right choice of course, should we be using body massage oils or lotions? Which is better? There is a purpose for both of these products. Use it when and what your skin needs. Body massage oils provide tons of benefits that help to moisturize the skin deep inside. Oil absorbs easily into the skin, and is super ideal for repairing dry and rough skin. Dry skin is when you don't have enough oil on your face; dehydrated skin is when you don't have enough water in your skin. However, to avoid unwanted skin issues, it is important to understand the ingredients that both oil and cream support. Some massage oil can calm down redness and rashes especially those with anti-inflammatory properties. Light formulations are excellent for everyday use. Just keep in mind that a small amount goes a long way. Lotions are a mixture of oil and water and typically work better for dry skin. Oils are best at locking in moisture due to their occlusive nature and they will work better when skin is wet. Immediately after a shower, oil is best used to seal in hydration. Lotions, on the other hand, are often better at penetrating skin because they are partly water-based, and can deliver ingredients that improve the ability of skin to maintain moisture. As we get older, our skin and its functions start to deteriorate and longing more for water and perhaps oil, because they function differently. Do remember that when your skin is dehydrated, it means you need to repair it with water and not oil. Then again we need to understand that water evaporates. Therefore oil is essential and should be the last step in your skincare routine. Ultimately, using either one will provide the same moisturizing goodness to the skin and boils down to your skin type. But, if you want to go the extra mile, having both in your routine will give your skin all the goodness it deserves. WHY AROMATHERAPY MASSAGE IS NOT SAFE DURING PREGNANCY? If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, do check with your doctor if any kind of massage is safe for you. Generally, massage might not be advisable during pregnancy. The reason is being that many essential oils are unsafe for pregnant women because they are not healthy for the mother or baby. There are concerns that essential oils can cross over into the placenta and result in fetus harm. Moreover, certain massage techniques and trigger points in the body can cause contractions and premature labour. They might also cause certain issues such as blood pressure effects or uterine contractions. Though prenatal massage is specifically designed for pregnant women, pregnancy massage may still have some risks, therefore it is best to avoid during pregnancy. WHAT IS OIL MASSAGE TECHNIQUE? Although oil massage is best done by a masseuse, massaging yourself can also be very effective, though it may not be satisfying. Otherwise you can learn the techniques and massage your partner with massage oils. Such a way you can give and receive beneficial massages at home without any professional training. Here are simple methods that can guide you along the way. First and foremost, set a soothing atmosphere. It is important to create a conducive environment for the purpose of deep relaxation. Try turning off overhead lights or closing the blinds. You might also want to burn some incense or play some soft music and ensure there is no distraction. Apply the massage oil to the whole body. Let the oil be absorbed through the skin for a while, say about five minutes. Massage oil enables hands to be easily glided over skin and provide a smoother and more comfortable feel. Be sure to rub the oil between your hands to warm it before putting it on your partner's skin. Start massaging the back lightly by making a soft, light circular motion with your palms and fingers. You may need to focus on this area a little longer. You may use kneading technique to apply pressure on the larger muscles present on both sides of the spine. Applying friction to areas with adhesions, on the shoulders and lower back especially, is very effective in working more deeply and creating a relieving, enjoyable massage. Next, knead the neck and shoulders with your thumbs gently, making sure to go deeply into the muscles. In sensitive areas such as the heart or stomach, use gentle pressure with soft motions of your finger, preferably circular motion. Stomach area should spend more time especially if dealing with bloated problem. This is the best time to debloat with your massage technique and massage oil. Massage the face, temple, forehead and face gently by using your fingers, making sure that the oil does not get into the eyes. Next, gently massage the top of the scalp by applying soft pressure with your thumbs. Use the fingertips to massage the temples in slow circular motion. Do remember to use circular massage movements on the head, chest, abdomen and joints, and kneading movements in front of the legs, arms and back. Every time there are nerve endings, such as the palms and soles of the feet, use additional oil, and spend more time massaging these areas. End the massage with some of the same long, light strokes you began with. Once you have finished, offer your partner and yourself a glass of water\u2014hydrating after a massage helps flush any impurities that were released in the body. You may want to rest a while before taking a shower after a long massage. A hot shower immediately after the massage will increase blood flow. This could cause dizziness and on top of that showering immediately after a massage will wash off the healing oils used before they can really get absorbed into the skin cells.
