Rather than swing, he volunteered to drink the deadliest toxin the court could find, along with some terra sigillata. The judge consented, on the grounds that this might provide an instructive test as to whether pellets of clay from the Greek island of Lemnos, long used as an antidote to poison, actually worked. The condemned man drank a teaspoon of mercuric chloride and swallowed a lump of the mystic clay. Court records recount that he went into spasms of pain, but survived. Clinical trials were so simple in those days. Earth-eating is one of the folk remedies examined in a new book, \"Honey, Mud, Maggots and other Medical Marvels\" by Robert and Mich\u00e8le Root-Bernstein*, which claims to explain the science behind the old wives' cures that work. Among such wonders, the authors list the use of maggots or honey to disinfect wounds, baths in hot springs to lower blood pressure, leeches as anti-coagulants and phlebotomy (bleeding) for angina. In case you were wondering, maggots help heal wounds by eating the dead flesh and leaving the living flesh intact\u2014unless the patient is unlucky enough to be maggotted by the species that does the opposite. Honey either stimulates white blood cells to destroy germs or exerts osmotic pressure to suck up all the water that keeps them alive (the Root-Bernsteins are not sure which). Soaking in a spa makes you urinate more, which cleans out the system. Leeches' saliva stops blood from clotting\u2014useful to the leeches when they are quaffing the stuff, and almost as useful to surgeons when they are operating and need to keep the patient's blood circulating. Phlebotomy can reduce excessively high levels of iron, and eating clay can bind up and neutralise ionised poisons such as mercury or lead. The Root-Bernsteins' enthusiasm for unconventional medicine does not stop there. Robert Root-Bernstein, a professor of physiology at Michigan State University, is perhaps best known for promoting the eccentric theory that HIV does not cause AIDS. But it is hard to quarrel with the main conclusions he and Mich\u00e8le draw from their research, and not just because mainstream medicine often makes a fool of itself, falling, for instance, for phrenology in the second half of the last century and for fanciful Freudian ideas in the first half of this one. Folk wisdom, they reasonably assert, often contains nuggets of therapeutic truth. Smallpox vaccination, for example, derived from the knowledge among 18th-century milkmaids that those who had suffered cowpox would not catch the much deadlier human version of the disease. The heart-stimulating effects of digitalis, which comes from foxgloves, were known to peasants long before doctors took note. Most folk cures, as the authors admit, have little value beyond a placebo effect. But the same is true of most promising compounds tested by pharmaceutical firms: less than one in 100 makes it to market. So long as proper controls are used, it is worth testing the efficacy of Chinese herbal remedies, acupuncture, Amazonian oral contraceptives et al. In the United States the federal government spends $12m a year doing just that. Several firms that profit by conventional medicine nonetheless have a soft spot for the unconventional. In Britain, Glaxo Wellcome, a drug multinational, has offered to fund efforts to save the leech from local extinction. In the United States, a number of health maintenance organisations (HMOs) have recently started to offer alternative treatments to their members. This does not necessarily mean that the HMOs' scientists endorse the claims of aromatherapists or chiropractors; it simply reflects the fact that patients often want \"natural\" medicine, and are prepared to pay for it. This book provides an amiable romp through the history of alternative medicine. But the authors' tendency to see conspiracies to suppress ancient wisdom is irritatingly implausible. On the failure of researchers to come up with a significant new contraceptive since discovery of the pill, they comment: \"Clearly the repression of contraceptive knowledge continues to this day.\" A more likely explanation is that nobody wants to make a new birth-control pill because any medicine ingested by healthy people carries a huge risk of lawsuits if some of them subsequently become ill and blame it on the drug. The authors also strain too hard to amuse. Bloodletting is \"a bloody good remedy\", honey poultices are a \"sweet treatment\". On the benefits of eating calcium carbonate: \"Chalk up another success for geopharmacy!\" Puns like these will make many of their readers feel a little queasy. * Houghton Mifflin; 270 pages; $24 This article appeared in the Moreover section of the print edition under the headline \"Maggots cure\" From the September 20th 1997 edition Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents "}
