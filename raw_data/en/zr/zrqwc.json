Over the last 5 years, there has been a substantial increase in the use of specific complementary and alternative medicine therapies, particularly mind-body interventions. Patients with rheumatic diseases and musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis may suffer not only from the physical manifestations of illness, but also from the nutritional, emotional, social and spiritual context in which their illness arises.
