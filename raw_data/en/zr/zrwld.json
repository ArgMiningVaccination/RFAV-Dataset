Asad Ullah D.H.M.S, R.H.M.P. (Muhammadi Homeo hospital) Pakistan How Homeopathy Works. Why it would be beneficial to use homeopathic substances to help treat an illness or health problem if the same substance seems to also contribute to illness? The idea is that this practice helps stimulate the immune system and the body's natural ability to heal. As the School of Homeopathy states, \"that which a substance is capable of causing, it is also capable of curing. \" One of the most important principles of homeopathic medicine is that treatments must be \"individualized\" and tailored to each person's specific symptoms, history, body and needs. Even if two people are battling the same illness, they can receive completely different commendations from their homeopathic doctors based on their unique situation and how their body would be expected to respond. Some key facts about homeopathy and how this system works: Homeopathic doctors first evaluate a patient and identify symptoms of an illness in order to \"match\" them with a remedy. Symptoms are usually graded depending on their intensity and frequency, and then specific remedies are assigned. Because homeopathy is a \"holistic\" practice, the patient's entire lifestyle, habits and background are considered. There's a very strong emphasis on emotional symptoms and conditions that might be contributing to an illness. For example, homeopathy considers that emotional stress can trigger tension headaches and a lack of sleep can contribute to digestive issues. A core belief in homeopathy is that mental and emotional symptoms are so important that they even outweigh many physical symptoms. The reason for this belief is that someone's personality, beliefs and mental/emotional symptoms are characteristic of the entire individual and affects their ability to heal. It's common for homeopathic medicines to be called \"tinctures\" or \"mother tinctures, \" which are simply solutions made from either grinding, distilling or extracting active ingredients in to some sort of carrier (usually either alcohol or water). Based on the number of \"potentization steps\" needed, a homeopathic remedy is diluted to a certain degree and assigned based on intensity of symptoms. Decimal potency numbers or ratios are given to each remedy, to state the ratio of active chemical ingredients in relation to either water or alcohol. In homeopathic medicine, there is an important distinction between \"potency\" and \"strength\" of a remedy. A remedy is not always considered to be stronger or better if it's more potent, since each person's reaction to a potency will be different. Many homeopathic substances can cause toxicity, poisoning or negative reactions if taken in high enough doses (like mercury, arsenic or even snake venom, for example). Therefore, very low doses are usually administered \u2014 even doses so low that the substance itself if practically unidentifiable due to be being heavily diluted. drasadkhan_007@yahoo.comAltern Integr Med 2019, Volume 8 DOI: 10.4172/2327-5162-C1-060Page 33 conferenceseries .com Volume 8 Alternative & Integrative Medicine ISSN: 2327-5162 Chinese Medicine 2019 March 04-05, 2019 March 04-05, 2019 | Berlin, Germany 10th International Conference on Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda & AcupunctureEthnopharmacology studies in Cameroon: A principle way for promoting drug discovery worldwide continue to strongly affect the world's population, particularly in South Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, Ethnopharmacology, which is a scientific multidisciplinary study of bio-resources and related knowledge or practices that local therapists have implemented for curative and preventive treatments or for diseases diagnostic, must now, be developed to fight diseases worldwide. Sustainable development is a standard or principle for which indigenous people aspire to common well-being. This perception started to be discussed since the end of the 20th century. We believe that this concept can be started to be effective now by producing cheaper improved traditional medicines (ITM). This study aims to identify, rationally collect and document several ethnomedical herbal medicines, heritage of various tribes ahead of their disappearance and to investigate and evaluate resources necessary for promoting drug discovery worldwide. To achieve these objectives we followed a focused methodology.

It is estimated that 80% of the African population is dependent on traditional medicines for contemporary community health care. Y et, so many stereotypes exist against traditional healers and their medicines. Traditional medicines are collectively called Muti and are described as folk medicine that has for millennia been used as healing practices for body and mind. They cover a wide range of therapies and practices that vary among different ethnic groups in South Africa. These medicines have been used since the beginning of humankind and stem from theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to a particular ethnic group. During colonialism, traditional healers were accused of practicing witchcraft, which led to the prohibition of the practice across various provinces. However, currently, South Africa is home to more than 200,000 traditional healers who care for many Africans.

Is it the time to change our approach, and try a multidisciplinary one that could bring about a change. Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a regular, home-based exercise could be influential in healing the VLU. Methods: 80 subjects (mean age: 65.13 years) were recruited for 12 weeks. The participants were randomised into a control group (n=20), a compression therapy group (n=20), an exercise group (n=20) and a compression and exercise group (n=20). The exercise comprised of 10 dorsiflexions each hour while the patient was awake. The first 2 groups did not perform any exercise while the other two did. Baseline and 3-month measurements were performed. These mesrements include skin perfusion assessment and ulcer size. Results: All patients showed low tcPO2 in the beginning of the study.

Chinese herbal medicine has a long history of successful treatment of diabetes. Long term consumption of food products containing herbs with hypoglycemic properties could be a viable treatment solution for diabetic patients. Aim: The purpose of this study was to develop a process for manufacturing a new bread product that contains Chinese herbs with hypoglycemic properties. Methods: Different fractions of the herbal formula were added into the dough to determine a maximum dosage that would produce bread that is palatable, shelf-stable, and retains desirable organoleptic properties of bread. Results: Results demonstrated little variation in moisture between control sample and samples with herbs. With increasing amounts of herbs, the acidity of the bread increased and the porosity decreased.

The investment law approved recently has good statements and rules on the above strategy in particular to pharmacy regulations. Under the pressure of the new privatisation policy, the government introduced radical changes in the pharmacy regulations. To improve the effectiveness of the public pharmacy, resources should be switched towards areas of need, reducing inequalities and promoting better health conditions.

Traditional eye medicines (TEM) are commonly used in the developing countries but their chemical composition, sterility and pH are neither known nor controlled leading to partial or total vision disability to users. Previous study in Tanzania reported 25% of corneal ulcers linked to TEM application. Our studies aimed at systematic documention of Tanzania TEM, assessment on awareness of health risks and safety evaluation. Information was obtained from published journal articles, books and ethnomedical studies in Kigoma and Misungwi districts. Safety evaluation included determination of pH, abscence of microbial contamination and mineral analysis. Study I reported 82 products, the majority (98%) were from plants, animal excreta and unrefined-salt. Tested products exhibited acidic pH (2.5 to 6.57) and contamination with pathogenic microbes.
