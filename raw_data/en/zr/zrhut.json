Yoga affects key functions of your endocrine system and choosing the right supplements to support a healthy endocrine system enables you to achieve your health goals faster. This article will unlock some of the ancient natural supplements that are clinically tested to maximize your yoga performance and accelerate your health gains. Now, lets begin. Yoga and Supplements [Harvard health experts](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/yoga-for-weight-loss-benefits-beyond-burning-calories-202112062650) said that yoga helps you to burn calories, tone your body and may also improve your mood. However, there are more things that you to do to achieve those goals. The traditional yogis are known to eat fresh food rich with herbs and spices. Most yogis are vegetarian and they avoid eating chemicals and stimulants found in processed foods. Whether you are on a strict diet regime, or not your body needs constant supply of nutrients from natural supplements. Hence, the role of yoga and supplements are key to a better health. In this article you will learn that yoga and supplements have direct impact to your hormones and glands, which forms vital part of your endocrine system. With more than 50 hormones in our body, key hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, cortisol, dopamine, DHEA, DHT, FSH, LH can be yoga and dietary supplementation to benefit your [endocrine system](https://www.epa.gov/endocrine-disruption/what-endocrine-system). Are dietary supplements useful for yoga? - The role of natural supplements here is to enable a little nudge to our gland to produce more hormones. At times, our glands (that produce the hormones) require a strong boost - which is crucial when you are either inactive for a long time, or perhaps your glands are producing the optimal amount of hormone due to aging, lifestyle and other conditions. - Some natural supplements contain adaptogen with hormonal-inducing properties that can elevate your body functions, maximize your yoga performance and drive better health gains. Firstly, lets touch on yoga and how it may affect to our overall health via the endocrine system. Does yoga help to support endocrine system? The short answer is yes. Yoga does bring a host of benefits to our endocrine system. Results from multiple studies and research, most of the potential health benefits from yoga is associated with our endocrine system. Potential benefits from yoga In fact, when coupled [with endocrine-focused supplements such as Tongkat Ali](https://akarali.com/tongkat-ali-endocrine/), yoga works more effectively and efficiently in delivering a [wide range of health benefits](https://akarali.com/potential-tongkat-ali-benefits/). Here is a common question by most yoga enthusiasts. What is endocrine system and why should I even care? Our endocrine system forms key functions of our human body and controls primary systems such as the male & female reproductive system (i.e fertility, libido, sexual functions), your central nervous system (i.e mood, cognition, stress, emotional responses), the urinary system and more importantly, the immune system (T-cells, CD4+ Na\u00efve cells, etc) Most of the primary endocrine systems function through hormones that are secreted by our glands (eg: adrenal glands, ovary, pituitary glands, testes). And doing yoga may be beneficial to your endocrine system. Those who practice yoga meditation will attest to the fact that eating quality food are equally important as performing the right yoga exercises. If you are new to yoga, then we will share how you can benefit the most from combining yoga and natural supplements. This explosive combo may elevate your health and your endocrine system to another level. So how does yoga help to support our endocrine system? There is plenty of scientific evidence on how yoga may support our endocrine system, but here are three common examples: Libido & Sexual Functions If you are woman and doing yoga, suffice to say that yoga helps to improve your sexual libido which is part of your endocrine system. The Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2009 reported that [regular yoga practice improves several aspects of sexual function in women,](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/yoga-may-help-improve-womens-sexual-function) including desire, arousal, orgasm, and overall satisfaction. This was based on a 12 week study involving 40 women between 22 to 55 years. In fact, the improved [sexual libido reported by women after performing yoga](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/yoga-for-a-better-sex-life) is closely related to the [increase of testosterone and DHEA](https://akarali.com/scientific-evidence-tongkat-ali-testosterone-booster/) that happens in the body. But, taking century old natural supplements such as [Tongkat Ali](https://akarali.com/about-tongkat-ali/) will boost your testosterone to new heights. Mood & Stress Response Although yoga may not significantly alter functions of the endocrine system like growth and metabolism, it may have a beneficial effect on your stress response. Our stress response is regulated mainly from our cortisol hormones, which exists in our central nervous system. Along with dopamine (i.e the feel-good hormone), you may feel better and more positive after yoga. Along with taking Tongkat Ali as a daily supplement, it is reported that it has profound impact in improving your mood (which is controlled central nervous system), through the [reduction of stress hormone known as cortisol.](https://akarali.com/tongkat-ali-stress-reliever/) Secretion of Hormones It is also reported (although not scientifically proven) that yoga poses \"pressurize and depressurize specific glands\" and this subtle compression and decompression can regulate secretions of hormones. [https://www.theyogamandala.com.sg/how-yoga-helps-in-the-endocrine-system/](https://www.theyogamandala.com.sg/how-yoga-helps-in-the-endocrine-system/) In other reports by Australian School of Meditation and Yoga (ASMY), yoga may help keep the pituitary gland rather healthy. The Australian School of Meditation and Yoga (ASMY) recommended one pre-meditation practice which is particularly helpful for [pituitary health](https://asmy.org.au/yoga/pituitary-gland/) is Brahmari (Humming Bee) Breathing. Top supplements for yoga Herbal supplements and vitamins are essential part of yoga to accelerate and achieve faster health gains.

Adaptogen supplement such as Tongkat Ali when coupled with exercises such as yoga, will accelerate your strength (upper body strength), promote lean muscle development whilst improving your libido and mood at the same time. For those who are doing yoga without taking supplement, you may experience less benefits, and may take a longer time to achieve those health goals. Yoga-friendly supplements are designed to accelerate you to achieve those health goals (eg: better mood, better sexual libido, better lean mass, weight loss and other benefits). Tongkat Ali Tongkat Ali is undoubtedly the best magic pill, and the best natural supplement for yoga enthusiasts. In fact, Tongkat Ali has been used for almost 4,000 years ago and [clinically tested to support a healthy endocrine system](https://akarali.com/tongkat-ali-endocrine/). The main mechanism of action of Tongkat Ali is by restoring hormonal balance through your pituitary and adrenal glands - translating into improved [testosterone, DHEA](https://akarali.com/tongkat-ali-testosterone-booster/), estrogen, more lean [muscle mass, strength](https://akarali.com/tongkat-ali-muscle-strength/) and improved mood by reducing [cognitive stress and tension](https://akarali.com/tongkat-ali-stress-reliever/).

Probiotics Probiotics used to be and still perceived as the \"it\" supplement in recent years due to marketing hype. It may be a good supplement to yoga enthusiasts as probiotics seemed to be doing its job in promoting good bacteria and yeast in the gut to improve digestion and overall health. However, you don't need a probiotic supplement as most [natural probiotics](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods) can found in foods such as yogurt, kefir (fermented dairy drink), sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), kimchi (spicy picked cabbage), and Kombucha tea. In a way, probiotics deliver single health benefits if you are doing yoga to improve your digestive system. B12 [Vitamin B12](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer/) is one nutrient that helps to keep your body's blood and nerve cells healthy. In fact, studies have showed that B12 enables to produce healthy DNA. There are many B12 supplements out there, but B12 nutrients can be found in fish, meat, poultry, eggs, and milk. If you are vegans and vegetarians and actively doing yoga, it's super important to supplement B12 to replenish what you would receive from animal products. There has been a lot of B12 supplements in the market and most will use B12 as part of their supplement \"stack\". Melatonin Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the body that regulates sleep patterns. While you can find it in whole foods like tart cherries, grapes, and walnuts, it might be easier to take a small supplement dose before bed to support your slumber. Melatonin can help you fall asleep and stay asleep, so you wake up feeling refreshed and ready for your morning yoga practice. Omega 3 Another buzzword when it comes to supplements: omega-3 fatty acids. EPA and DHA are two types of omega-3 fatty acids primarily found in certain fish, but vegans and vegetarians can take supplements made from marine algae (where the fish get it!). Parting Thoughts Lest we forget, doing yoga without the right supplement will not help you to achieve your health goals. This applies to any form of exercises for that matter. Yoga requires the best natural supplements and vitamins to work. Some opt for a more aggressive option by taking more than required supplements for competitive sports, but that's just another story. No doubt, Tongkat Ali is the best natural supplement for yoga.

Consuming Tongkat Ali with the right [daily dosage](https://akarali.com/tongkat-ali-dosage-guide-2021/) is equally important too. In fact, yoga and Tongkat Ali both share one commonality.

And thanks to modern science, research and clinical studies, yoga and Tongkat Ali may be the perfect combo if you are seeking to rejuvenate and revitalize your health. Give it a try. Gain more.
