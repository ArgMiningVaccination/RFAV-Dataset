There is no uniform approach or ge neric label assigned to traditional medicine; rather, it is an acknowledgment of the geogra phic and cultural diversity within Indigenous knowledge. The examination of traditional medicine includes articulating an Indigenous knowledge approach to understand ing what traditional medicine is and why it historically existed outside dominant institutions, biomedi cal models, and Eurocentric paradigms. As defined in the Report on the Pr otection of Heritage of I ndigenous People, \"Indigenous knowledge is a complete knowledge system with its own epistemology, philosophy, and scientific and logical vali dity... which can only be understood by means of pedagogy traditionally employed by the people themselves\" (Battiste and Henderson, 2000: 41). There are three common sources within I ndigenous knowledge inquiry. Mohawk scholar Marlene Brant Castellano suggests that In digenous knowledge has a multiplicity of sources, including traditional, spiritual, and empirical (Dei, Hall and Rosenthal, 2000). The plurality of Indigenous knowledge engages a holistic paradigm that acknowledges the emotional, spiritual, physical, and ment al well-being of a people. An Indigenous knowledge framework is developed to address cr itical issues of co lonialism appropriating Indigenous authority, of misrep resentation, and of using west ern cultural constructs of \"valid empirical research\" to marginalize Indigenous ways of knowing (Dei, Hall and Rosenburg, 2000; Battiste and Henderson, 2000; . The term \"traditional medicine,\" as iden tified by the World Health Organization, \"is the sum total of knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences Indigenous to different cult ures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnos is, improvement of treatment of physical and mental illness.\" (WHO/EDM/Traditional Medicine/Definiti ons, modified: Tuesday, 30 October 2001) The National Aboriginal Hea lth Organization (NAHO), governed by First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit organizations of Canada, is embarking on a new journey that positions traditional medicine as central to their mandate. A summary will be provided of key issues that evolved from an environmental scan of tr aditional medicine conducted for NAHO, and from focus groups with Elders and healers. An examination of emergent concerns identified through the environmental scan of Aboriginal organi zations, traditional medicinal studies and literature identified a num ber of critical issues. The cultural diversity of Indigenous Peoples is addressed through th e recognition that Indigenous knowledge is attached to the language, landscapes, and cultu res from which it emerges. Scholar Vandana Shiva states, 4 However, under the colonial influence the biological and intellectual heritage of non-western societies was devalued. The priorities of scientific development...transformed the plurality of knowledge systems into a hierarchy of knowledge systems. When knowledge plural ity mutated into knowledge hierarchy, the horizontal ordering of diverse but e qually valid systems was converted into vertical ordering of unequal systems, and the epistemologi cal foundations of western knowledge were imposed on non-western knowledge systems with the result that the latter were invalidated (Shiva, 2000: vii in De i, Hall and Rosenburg). The framework to which the environmental scan and research with El ders and healers adhered is also elaborated upon by Battiste and Henderson: Indigenous peoples regard all products of the human mind and heart as interrelated within Indigenous knowledge. They assert that all knowledge flows from the same source: the relationships betw een global flux that needs to be renewed, the people's kinship with the spirit world. Since th e ultimate source of knowledge is the changing ecosystem itself, art and scien ce of a specific people manifest these relationships and can be considered as manifestations of people's knowledge as a whole (Battiste and Henderson, 2000: 43). Environmental Scan The preliminary work consisted of archival literature and orga nizational searches. Conferences on the topic of traditional me dicine were hosted across North America, including New Mexico, Ariz ona, British Columbia, and Washington. These were key opportunities to attend conferences that yielded a great deal of information on the subject of traditional medicine. The resultant disc ussions raised themes that ranged from government policy to contemporary implementations of strategies used by both healers and Indigenous medical practitioners. The confer ences allowed space for a network of policy makers, healers, researchers and academics to share information on traditional medicine, healing, and research. Time Frame Another important aspect of the environmen tal scan on traditional medicine involves alerting people to the limitations of a time frame . The scope of the scan and of research with Elders was impacted by the limitation of a very short time period (from August 2001 to December 2002). The diversity of Indigenous people within Canada also posed a variety of geocultural challenges; for ex ample, literature by or about M\u00e9tis was very scarce, partly due to lack of existing information or research ers' limited ability to travel for extended periods of times. In the United States a sizable contribution to academic literature has 5emerged on the topic of traditional medicine comp ared to Canada. Most of this literature is focused on the Southwest (particularly the Nava jo) and Plains Indians of South and North Dakota. Significantly, very little of the em pirical research is by Indigenous scholars, community practitioners, or Elders . Only three of the 30 empirical studies analyzed were designed, implemented and articulated by A boriginal scholars, Elders/traditional practitioners or communities. Of the three, two were doctoral dissert ations by Aboriginal students who used their people and or communi ty to support their research. M\u00e9tis people are under-represented in all areas of the research and literature. Through a literature overview a nd an examination of Aborigin al organizations traditional medicine policies and protocols, several centr al questions emerge. Wh at is \"traditional medicine\" according to the literature and acad emics? What is a \"traditional healer\" and how do we identify a healer? How are existing Aboriginal organizations using traditional medicine and practitioners, and how does this compare to academic research? What are the emergent issues in the field of traditional medicine? In the spirit of plurality and diversity, we frame traditional medicine as a practice of healing that is valid and diverse. There is no intention to establish a monolithic representation of what traditi onal medicine is or how Indi genous knowledge contextualizes these practices. The differences contained in this framework are best summed up by Marlene Brant Castellano: The knowledge valued in aboriginal soci eties derives from multiple sources, including traditional teachings, empirical observation, and revelation...Aboriginal knowledge is said to be personal, oral , experiential, holis tic, and conveyed in narrative or metaphorical langua ge... (Castellano, 2000: 25). The acknowledgment that there are multiple so urces of knowledge assists us in how to explore traditional medicine. The development of an Indigenous discour se creates a greater presence in research priorities, academia a nd policy making. It is crucial that Indigenous scholars have the space and support to initiate an Indigenous research agenda that will foster a holistic approach to health and wellness. The Complexity of Holistic Approaches Since traditional medicine is firmly grounded in holistic beliefs and pr actices, any research must have a multidisciplinary focus. The primary research analyzed emerged from diverse western academic disciplines that include d anthropology, sociology, Na tive studies, social work, psychology, history, western biomedicine, religion, and philosophy. One interesting fact is that some of the most developed literature was found w ithin Native justice research - it's ironic that traditional me dicine was often found in prison. 6Other non-academic sources (i.e. \"non-peer-re viewed\" journals) further complicated the literature search of traditional medicine. The key host site for traditional medicine exists \"outside\" of western academic or medical in stitutions and within Indigenous communities, urban or otherwise. Indigenous organizations such as the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, M\u00e9tis Resources Center and Inuit Arctic Coll ege or Indigenous journals provided some literature; these formed the Indigenous presen ce within the literatu re overview in the study. A related finding of the preliminary environmental scan is that traditional medicine is fragmented and through coloni al history has been hidden by Indigenous Peoples from church, government, and educational institu tions for fear of retribution or even imprisonment (RCAP, 1996). Hi storian Maureen Lux elaborat es upon the history of this relationship between church, government, and Indigenous communities: The stated rationale for repressing the dan ces was that they interfered with farm work and 'unsettled' the people. In tr uth Native people's special knowledge of healing, which they gained through visi ons and experience and passed on through the transfer of bundles at ceremonial da nce camps, was being actively suppressed... The construction of the healer as quack a nd the dances as a barbaric waste of time served to justify repre ssion of both (Lux, 2001: 84). Only recently have Indigenous Peoples in No rth America begun to re vitalize traditions openly and without fear of pers ecution. We must remember that it is only since the 1970s that legal bans on heal ing/religious ceremonies such as the Sundance have been lifted. This Indigenous literature is often f ound outside of academia and within Native organizations and their resource libraries, re search reports (founded either by government or community bodies) and Web sites such as Am erican Indian Physicians Association, the World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization. The latter is not an exhaustive account of where to research trad itional medicine; it is an indication of the complexity and global nature of the subject. Defining Indigenous Medicine Another challenge of researching traditional medical practices is the lack of consistency and clarity in the terminology used by author s to describe various beliefs and practices. Often the term \"traditional medicine\" is loosel y applied to a variety of diverse activities that are not always uniformly acknowledged among Indigenous pract itioners and their clients. It is a useful exercise to discuss th e variety of definitions that traditional medicine is, or is not accorded, the latter being the case in most academic and non-academic journals. Of all the literature reviewed, only a handful of sources offered general descriptions of the characteristics of traditional medicine and rarely defined the term. When reviewing the literature, it is important to consider two points: 7 I. The term \"traditional\" is a British col onial concept, dislik ed by many Indigenous groups. II. Academic and institutiona l scholars introduced the term to Indigenous Peoples of North America. Most Indigenous groups would have relied on a complex set of medical practices and beliefs referred to simply as \"medicine.\" Only the Europeans, with a mandate to separate and prioritize beliefs that were not their own, utilized the term \"traditional.\" A few academic articles attempted to \"operati onalize\" the term \"tra ditional\" in their empirical studies and cited a number of defi nitions. The authors tended to divide their discussion of medical practices into two time periods, pre- and post-contact. The term \"traditional medicine\" has therefore b een conceptualized in several ways . The Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996) defines traditional healing: Traditional healing has been defined as \"practices designed to promote mental, physical and spiritual well-be ing that are based on belie fs which go back to the time before the spread of western 'sci entific' bio-medicine. When Aboriginal Peoples in Canada talk about traditiona l healing, they include a wide range of activities, from physical cure s using herbal medicines and other remedies, to the promotion of psychological and spirit ual well-being using ceremony, counseling and the accumulated wisdom of elders (RCAP, 1996, Vol.3: 348). Within the literature review ed, different aspects of t raditional medicine were discussed. A common term used by anthropologists is \"sha man\" or shamanic healing. According to William Lyon's Encyclopedia of Native American Healing (1998), This is the first scholarly work to survey the mystery powers of Native American shamans with respect to healing. It's long overdue. ... In sifting through this evidence one sees that shamanism has very definite cross-cultural patterns. That is, it is an organized system with defi nite rules of operation...because our understanding of shamanic healing rudimentary at 1998: xv). Lyon situates shamanic healing as \"irrational\" bu t effective, and he is concerned with ritual whereas other texts are focused on botany. So metimes the discussion focuses on ritual practices and other times on the pharmacology and botanical knowledge. Below are some examples of the range of categories discussed in the literature overview under the term \"traditional medicine\" or \"shamanism.\" S outh and Central Americans use the term \"shaman\" more frequently than do Indigenous Pe oples of North America. In a text titled, Gathering of Shamans in the Columbian Amazon (1999), the authors state: The word 'shaman' is fashionable today. Originally, it referred to the way the Tungus (a Siberian people with linguistic tie s to the Manchurians) referred to those individuals responsible for th e health of the community a nd their relationship to the 8supernatural world. Today the term shama n, as used by anthropologists, has been extended to cover herbalists, traditional healers, and priests of Native peoples throughout the world... (Union of Traditi onal Yag\u00e9 Healers of the Columbian Amazon Umiyac, 1999: 45). Through the environmental scan which includes the Americas, New Zealand and Australia, and India, a few specialized fields within traditional medicine practice emerged - while each remained interdependent on the other. Specialized Fields of Practice within Traditional Medicine Spiritualist - a practice that focuses on the spiritual he alth of an individu al and intervenes on his or her behalf. Diagnosis often includes lifestyle changes of the individual or family and offerings to various benevol ent spirits. Also, this person often serves as a counsellor, mentor or teacher to individuals and families. Their primary focus is on the spiritual well- being of people. Their knowledge of cultural sp iritual practices is expansiv e and highly respected by the community, and they often carry titles of honour such as \"Faithkeeper, Holy Person or in South America, (Traditional) Priest.\" Herbalist - a practice that emphasizes botanical and pharmacology knowledge of the indigenous plants and fauna. Of ten these individuals work closely with other Indigenous doctors and assist in providing remedies fo r individuals whom they or others have diagnosed. Their practice can be highly specia lized in one field, such as remedies for snakebites, or as diverse as the illnesses themselves. Diagnosis specialist - a practice that often involves communication with spirits, the supernatural and the physical ent ities that assist in the dia gnosis. Diagnosticians are often the \"seers\" or communicators through cerem ony who identify the ailments, remedies or ceremonies that are required to restore good sp iritual, emotional, a nd physical health, and well-being. Often they work as referrals to other specialists. Medicine man/woman - a practice that may and often doe s possess all of the above gifts and more. Their work usually engages in ritu al, ceremonial activity and prayer. In some societies they are identified as \"medicin e men/women\" because they possess sacred bundles, sacred pipes, sacred masks, and the rights to rituals, songs and medicines that have been inherited from their parents, grandparents, or that they earned through apprenticeship with a respect ed medicine man or woman. Depending on their nation, they are also conductors of community ceremonies such as Sundance, Dark Dances, Horse Dance, False Face, Shaking Tent, and Sweat Lodge, to name a few. It is normative for these individuals to sacrifice their daily lives to ritual, prayer and healing. 9Healer - a gifted individual who ma y heal in a variety of ways , including all of the above and or a \"gift\" of touch, or energy work - mean ing that ritual is not always needed. Healers can be ritualistic, but also may have an ability to use a variety of therapies to heal people spiritually, emotionally or physically. Midwife - Often, these practitioners are women with specialized knowledge in prenatal care, birthing assistance and aftercare. The midwife may employ the use of massage, diets, medicines and ritual, prayers and/or counselli ng. Traditional midwif ery exists worldwide and involves a variety of skills, often biophysical, but can also include spiritual and ritual activity as well. None of the specialized cat egories are solely exclusiv e; rather, they are often interdependent and some practitioners may hold a number of specia lized knowledges. In this sense, the literature suggests that tradit ional medicine is similar to Western medicine in the range and variety of special knowledge/training of caregivers (Coulehan, 1980; Waldram, 1990; McWhorter and Ward, RCA P: 1996). A word of caution - the focus groups with Elders and healers expressed c oncern regarding the \"clinicalization\" of traditional medicine as a means of transforming the practice from cultures to institutions. The Maori have developed a number of compone nts for traditional he aling, as Aroha Mead states in her paper, \"A Policy and Ethical Framework to Improve Maori Health Through Maori Traditional Healing.\" Traditional hea ling comprises a number of components, each one requiring the following specialist knowledge: Mirimiri massage, physiotherapist, chiropractor Rongoa ethnobotany - medicines derive d from Native flora and fauna Karakia spiritual well-being of the person, their family and immediate environment; protection (Mead, 2000: 4). It can be said that in North American hea ling traditions, there are many specialized fields. Catherine Kim's article, \" Navajo Use of Native Healers \" (1998), points out that there are several categories of healers which range from diagnostician such as hand tremblers, crystal gazers, and 'listeners', to individuals who perform ceremonies... (Kim, 1998: 1). In American Indian Medicine (1992), the authors point out th at there were bone setters who were \"state of the art among American Indians when Europeans came. The Aleuts washed wounds and sutured with bone needle and sinew thread; the Koniags surgically removed stones from the distal urethra... \"( McWhorter and Ward, 1992: 625). The range of knowledge and medical specia lties has narrowed over time since colonialism and modernization have supplanted the use of I ndigenous methods of obstetrics, bone setting, and surgery. However, the specific categories do not always capture th e entire spectrum of traditional medicine. Nunavut Arctic College published five volumes of Inuit Elders' knowledge ranging in subjects from Childrearing Practices (2001) to Cosmology and Shamanism (2001). The innovative approach to the re search and work with Elders heralded 10extremely worthwhile data on these subjects. In Perspectives on Traditional Health (2001), the authors state, While discussing traditional health pract ices and medical knowledge, one could expect elders to give a list of the best techniques to cure sickness depending on the various types of health problems or injuri es they were facing in the past: how to deal with boils, infections, fever, eye infections, colds, broken bones, drowning, and so on. But the Inuit perspective encompasses much more. Along with techniques to heal cuts and wounds, a nd to cure sickness...elders discussed recollections of how to have a strong mind and a resilien t body.... It is important to make clear that in Inuit societies medical knowledge never existed as an autonomous and formal body of knowledge as in modern Western societies (Ootoova, Atagutsiak, Ijj ngiaq, Piteolak, Joamie holistic approach of Indigenous medici ne is both its genius and its ultimate complexity. Traditional Medicine: Intricate Relationship to Land, Language, and Culture Indigenous literature on the t opic of Indigenous medicine emphasizes the ties to land, language, and culture. The natural environment shapes the medical expertise and practices employed by each Indigenous group. For example, the Hopi knowledge of medicine for venomous snakebites would likely not be known or practised in the Northwest Territories; similarly, the Hopi might not have developed any medicines for frostbite. Battiste and Henderson articulate the cultu ral approach to knowledge applied by Indigenous people. The traditional ecological knowledge of Indi genous people is scientific, in the sense that it is empirical, experimental, and systematic. It differs in two important respects from western science, however; traditional ecological knowledge is highly localized and it is social. Its focus is the web of relationships between humans, animals, plants, natural forces, spirits, and land forms in particular locality, as opposed to the discovery of universal la ws (Battiste and Henderson, 2000: 44). Another Indigenous scholar, Gregory Cajete, coined the term \"ethnoscience\" in his book, Look to the Mountain (2001). He articulates Indigenous epistemology as tied to the land, the spiritual laws that govern that land, and how co-existence between animal, plant and human life interrelate to a co llective balance. He explores how ethnoscience reflects the uniqueness of place and thus, Indigenous know ledge of traditional medicine would inherently be tied to land and e xpressed through language and culture. 11 Current Issues in Locality and Culture The recent charges faced by two healers from Ecuador for \"criminal negligence causing death and administering, trafficking in and im porting into Canada a controlled substance,\" (Carr: 3 November 2002, Canadian Press) ha ve widespread implicat ion for traditional healers. The two medicine men are currently facing lengthy court cases as a result of the death of an individual during a ceremony in the community of Wikwemikong. The case of the men from Ecuador rests in the notion of \"trafficking controlled substances.\" The controlled substance in ques litera ture. Issues related to the Ecuador ian healers and us e of substances will be revisited throughout the pape r in appropriate topical areas. The key issue that emerges relates to the notion that Indigenous healing practices are localized and culturally specific. This issue therefore has implications for transplanting traditional medicine to culturally diverse peoples. The question that constantly arises is: do traditional medicine's methods restrict Indige nous knowledge to locality or culture? Concepts of Traditional Medicine - Policy According to Wade Davis (a renowned anthr opologist and ethnobotan tist who may shed some light on \"contextualizing\" both the use of ayahuasca and the vast gaps between western and Indigenous appr oaches to medicine): To understand the role of the shaman, a nd to know anything of his genius in using plants, one must be prepared to accept the possibility that when he tells of moving into realms of the sp irit, he is not speaking in metaphor. This was perhaps the most difficult lesson for me to learn as an ethnobotanist schooled in scie nce... With the dexterity of a modern chemist, they recognized that the differe nt compounds in relatively small concentrations might effectively poten tiate one another. In the case of ayahuasca, some twenty-one mixtures have been identified, including most notably Psychotria viridis... \"Now I ask you,\" Dennis said, \"how on earth did they figure it out?\" What are the odds against finding in a forest of fifty thousand species, two plants , totally different, one vi ne, the other shrub, and then learning to combine them in su ch a precise way th at their unique and highly unusual chemical properties co mplement each other perfectly...? (Davis, 2001: 75). The geographic location of a healer is the de fining characteristic. Both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Peoples agree on this point. The question of transporting healers from nation to nation is at the heart of the tradi tional medicine contemporary issues. Perhaps the case of the two shamans now charged in Cana da is a cautionary ta le demanding further 12exploration. Limited exemptions for traditiona l healers exist in some jurisdictions. For example, the Regulated Health Professions Act, 1991, Statutes of Ontario, states that: \"This Act does not apply to, (a) aboriginal he alers providing traditional healing services to aboriginal persons or members of the aborig inal community.\" The issue that emerges is: should national, or even international ex emptions exist for traditional healers? \"Healer\" is a term used to describe trad itional healing practitioners, shamans or \"doctors\" in the literature. This is in contrast to descriptions of western biomedicine which rarely self-defines \"physicians , doctors or surgeons\" as \"hea lers.\" Most references to western biomedicine do not refer to curing as healing since, as one author states, \"both terms have a somewhat unscientific aura a bout [them], conjuring up a vague notion of quackery\" (Coulehan, 1976: 93). Indigenous literature sugges ts they are not looking for validation by biomedical models. Front-line institutions that provide various form s of traditional healing are struggling with defining healer; for example, th e correctional services of Canada and Justice Inquiries have ironically been leaders in developing definitio ns related to traditional healing. Waldrum's The Way of the Pipe: Aboriginal Spiritualit y and Symbolic Healing in Canadian Prisons (1997) states: The healer is central to the process of symbolic healing, and in this sense Aboriginal Elders are central to Aborigin al spirituality. Howeve r, the status of \"healer\" or \"Elder\" is ambiguous and neve r clearly defined. Indeed, it must be negotiated in each therapeutic or spiritual encounter. The question of who is an \"Elder\" is a thorny one. The general standa rd is acceptance by the 'community' as an \"Elder\" (Waldrum, 1997: 109). Another author, Rupert Ross, explores th e philosophy of the jus tice system and how Aboriginal people transform a \"criminal\" into an unhealthy person in need of healing or counsel; its logic and rationale are tied to traditions in Returning to the Teachings (1996). Healing is almost an omnipotent en tity within Aboriginal society. As the modern era has ended formal assi milation policies and introduced multicultural policies that support Indigenous traditionalism, an interesting challenge is now faced by Indigenous Peoples, the institutionalization of tradition! (RCAP, 1996; Waldrum, 1997; Frideres, 1993). The fact that government agencies \"support\" th e revitalization of Aboriginal \"culture and herita ge\" creates the need to analyze what kind of impact these new policies will have on specific areas, mo st critically, traditional medicine. The Regulated Health Professions Act , 1991 defines \"Aboriginal healer\" as an Aboriginal person who provides Aboriginal healing serv ices (Chapter 18, 1991). This open-ended definition can become a double-edged sword, since the vague definition of healer is both a protection of Indigenous autonomy and a poten tial danger that could allow the opportunist to pose as authentic healer and re-victimize Aboriginal people. 13 The Role of Authority, Authenticity and Elders Within the literature, the terms \"Elder\" and \"healer\" are used interchangeably since traditional teachings are considered healing fo r the mind. \"Elder\" is another term attached to traditional medicine that is discussed in a vague and inconsistent manner. The Gathering Strength volume of the Report of the Royal Commi ssion on Aboriginal Peoples (1996) states that Elders are: Keepers of tradition, guardians of culture, the wise people, the teachers. While most of those who are wise in traditional ways are old, not all old people are elders, and not all elders are old (RCAP, 1996, Vol.3: 527). There is an abundance of literature that refers to Elders, but within the literature the authors offer no definitions for the term. One exception is Gwitch'in Native Elders by Shawn Wilson (1996). The author writes, What is an Elder? What are the characteristic s of elders that differentiate them from simply being elderly persons? ...With in creasing frequency, elders are being recognized as those who hold the power to carry communities b ack to a place of synergism and well-being (Katz, 1984; Ka tz and Seth, 1986)... The elder defends the values of family, not only thr ough words and thoughts but through deeds (Wilson, 1996: 7). Some authors describe the characteristics attr ibuted to Elders, but neglect to define the concept. The Report of the Royal Commissi on on Aboriginal Peoples (1996) has taken on the task of answering the question, \"W ho are Elders?\" The authors state: Elders are respected and cherished indivi duals who have amassed a great deal of knowledge, wisdom and experience over the period of many, many years. They are individuals who have also set examples, and have contributed something to the good of others. In the process, they usually sacrifice something of themselves, be it time, money or effort... Elders, Old ones, Grandfathers and Grandmothers don't preserve the ancestral knowledge. They live it (RCAP, 1996, Vol.4: 109). Inuit refer to the elderly as \"inutuquak,\" but those considered Elders are referred to as \"angijukqauqgatigiit,\" which translated means a \"union of elders\" (RCAP, 1996). According to the guidelines developed by Co rrectional Services Ca nada, an Elder: ...is any person recognized by an external Aboriginal community as having knowledge and understanding of the traditiona l culture of the community, including the physical manifestations of the culture of the people and their spiritual and social traditions. Knowledge and wisdom, coupled with the recognition of respect of the 14people of the community, are essential for defining characteristics of an Elder/spiritual Advi sor\" (CSC, 2001: 4). The M\u00e9tis posed the question to a group of M\u00e9 tis Elders during a re cent conference, and their definition was, Traditionally, we referred to these individuals as \"old folk s.\" They were really clan leaders and they had to earn the re spect of others and to have good sound reputation. They were also our hist orians.... (Shore and Barkwell, 1997: 206). A key characteristic is that Elders do not seek status; instead, it flow s from the people. The numerous terms used within the Native langua ges refer to people w ho have earned their title (Meili, 1992). Within the practice of traditional medicine and healers, Elders are practitioners, often serving as \"psychologists, spiritual leader s or counsellors\" who are parts of a living, evolving belief system. Amongst Indigenous so cieties, multiple components are not fixed or static. It would be safe to suggest the concepts are evol ving, while the characteristics remain steeped in cultural principles, values and beliefs. The goal of medicine, and the role of the healers and Elders, are to care for the mind, body and spir it of the people. The needs of the people have changed over time. The cha llenge is adapting the concepts to fit new and different circumstances. Healer, Elder a nd medicine may not always remain solely attached to tradition. The dive rsity of healers and Elders not only emerges from their cultural diversity, but also from their colonial history and location; urban, rural and remote Indigenous communities have very different ex pectations and approaches in identifying and accessing Elders and healers. Protecting Traditional Medicine from Exploitation and Appropriation With Respect to Indigenous Knowledge, we stress the necessity of recognition and respecting, in both national legislation and international law, the principle that any acquisition, publica tion, scientific use, or commercial application of Indigenous knowledge must be in accordan ce with the customary laws of the peoples concerned, as determined by them (Battiste and Henderson, 2000: 269). A critical debate taking place within Indi genous communities on a global scale involves concerns over the transformation of ceremony, r itual and healing into commodities. We are now entering a new era with the selling of what was traditionally considered sacred knowledge offered to all for a fee. There is not enough research or literature to fully examine th e issue of commodification of ceremony. There is some historical documenta tion on performing ceremonies for trade or a fee in early ethnographical l iterature. One of the earlies t written accounts regarding 15ceremony in exchange for monies involved a fur trader and a trapper. While the fur trader was skeptical of the abilities of the medicine man to locate his \"los t fur traders,\" he was desperate enough to barter the exchange. The medicine man did perform the shaking tent ceremony and did locate (accurately) the fur traders, and received some goods and monies for his service. By Nelson's own accounts, the medicine man continued to offer his services for trade (Nelson, 1989). Other accoun ts of medicine men/women engaging in ceremony for wages can be found in early ethnographies, such as Mendleblum's Western Woods Cree (Mendleblum, 1934). The issue of exchanging ritual services for wa ges is not new. The more interesting question is: how does it impact the integrity of the social fibre of Indigenous societies and authenticity of modern traditional medicine practitioners? In Ch ristopher Ronwanien:te Jock's article, acred Knowledge in the Consumer Age\" in Native American Spirituality (2000), he cites a statement of The Center for the Support and Protection of Indigenous Re ligions and Indigenous Tr aditions presented in 1993, Traditional ceremonies and spiritual practi ces... are precious gift s given to Indian people by the Creator. These sacred ways ha ve enabled us as Indian people to survive -miraculously - the onslaught of fi ve centuries of continuous effort by non- Indians and their government to extermin ate us by extinguishing all traces of our traditional ways of life. Today, these precious sacred traditions continue to afford American Indian people of a ll [nations] the strength and vitality we need in the struggle we face everyday; they also offer us our best hope for a stable and vibrant future. These sacred traditions are an enduring and indisp ensable \"life raft\" without which we would be quickly overwhelmed by the adversities that still threaten our survival. Because our sacred traditions are so precious to us, we cannot allow them to be desecrated and abused (CSPIRIT, 1993 in Jock, 2001: 66). The concern about traditional ceremonies be ing transformed into a commodity for sale erodes traditional ideals and values. The tr aditional practice of offering a gift to practitioners, usually in the form of food or ot her practical items, is no longer sufficient in a wage economy. Few of the articles review ed discussed the impact of wage economy on traditional medicine. However, intellectual property rights are a major concern for Indigenous people, Battiste and Henderson state: The various legal regimes that we call intellectual property attached exclusive property rights to this autonomous culture to enhance its commodification - culture could then be bought and sold in the ma rketplace (Battiste and Henderson, 2000: 250). The marketing of traditional knowledge poses on e of the central concerns for traditional healers, knowledge carriers and Elders. Commodification of ceremony and traditional medicine will continue to frame the discourse of traditional medicine in public domains for 16the capitalist markets. As cited in testimony of the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: We have also come across many self-proclaimed healers who have abused and exploited traditional spirituality in th eir Aboriginal people (Sanderson, 1993) (Castellano in Dei Hall and Rosenburg, 2000: 32). Jock argues that the role of authenticity and lineage descent of what he calls, \"plastic medicine men,\" are not always falsely cl aimed identity. The consumerism by New Age enthusiasts and others of Na tive spirituality holds real consequences for Indigenous cultural survival that includes spirituality and healing. Jock ar ticulates that the reaction to commodifying culture from traditional practitione rs or community is uniform, as is the ostracism of those who sell sacred knowledge fo r profit. The Union of Yag\u00e9 Healers of the Columbian Amazon gathered to deal with many of these issues; they resolved that: Non-Indigenous people are realizing the importance of our wisdom and the value of our medicinal and sacred plants. Ma ny of them profane our culture and our territories by commercializing yage and other plants; dressing like indigenous people and acting like charlatans. We view with concern a new type of tourism being promoted... (UMIYAC, 1999: 110). Intellectual Property Rights According to the Rural Advancement Foundatio n Institute Report to the United Nations, over 80 per cent of the world's people depe nd on Indigenous knowledge for health and security and 50 per cent rely on Indigenous knowledge for crops and food (Dei, Hall and Rosenburg, 2000). The United Nations subcom mission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities reports, The annual market value of pharmaceutical products derived from medicinal plants discovered by Indigenous peoples exceeds US$43 billion, but the profits are rarely shared with Indigenous Peoples. Traditiona l healers have employed most of the 7000 natural compounds used in natural me dicine for centuries; 25 percent of American prescription drugs contain activ e ingredients derived from Indigenous knowledge of plants (Daes, 1993: 1; Battiste and Henderson, 2000: 124). Intellectual property rights regarding traditional medicine are highly controversial, stemming from the historical and continue d exploitation of Indigenous knowledge by Eurocentric prospectors . Today, large pharmaceutical companies mine Indigenous knowledge, acquiring patents and profit from it. According to the Indigenous People's Council on Biocolonialism Life, Lineage and Sustenance Primer and Resource Guide (2001), 17As plants and animals have been pirated from their communities, indigenous peoples have been forced to respond to pr otect the life in their territories and their traditional knowledge. In many cases, communities are finding out as much as a decade later that one of their sacred plants , animals, or methods has been patented. Some indigenous peoples have been deve loping mechanisms to protect collective community based rights over plants, an imals, human genetic material, and traditional medicinal and agricultural knowledge (Harry and Shelton, 2001: 12). There are a number of cases successfully f ought by Indigenous groups for protecting their traditional medicinal knowledge. In 1986 an Am erican, Loren Miller, was awarded the patent for the vine banisteriopsis caapi, th e bark used to make the ceremonial drink ayauasca. In 1999, the Coordi nating Body of Indigenous Or ganizations of the Amazon Basin, together with the Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment successfully challenged the patent. They claimed that there was no invention since the plant has been used by the Indigenous Peoples living in the Amazon Basin for generations (Harry and Shelton, 2001: 14). Another case of patenting I ndigenous knowledge involves the neem tree of India, which has been used for a number of medicinal pur poses for over 2000 years. The patent of the neem tree by U.S. agrochemical giant W. R. Grace Corporation was successfully challenged in May 2000 (Ibid.). The historical and contemporary struggl e for protection of Indigenous knowledge from exploitation by indu stry and private miners is of critical importance to the traditional medicinal literature. Exploitation of Traditional Medicine Access to sacred knowledge is ordinarily re stricted to particul ar individuals and organization within Indigenous communities, such as initiated men or women, or to members of special religious societies.... The Navajo Na tion, the largest Indigenous people in the United States... has adopted laws to punish Navajos and physically remove non-Navajos who engage in unauthor ized research or trade in cultural property... (Battiste and Henderson. 2000: 142-3). Unemployment levels in many Indigenous communities reach as high as 95 per cent. As a result, the poverty experienced by many Indige nous families leaves esteemed Elders and spiritual leaders vulnerable to intellectual mining or pirati ng and economic e xploitation of culture and tradition. Also, the co-opti on of many healing initiatives by New Age movements has become epidemic in some regions of the United States. Today, the revitalization of traditional medi cinal healing practices is going public or mainstream, which opens new challenges for traditional knowledge keepers and traditional healing practitioners. The New Age movement is a multimillion-dollar industry, Myke 18Johnson's article, \"Wanting to be Indian: iritual teachings turn into cultura l theft,\" warns: How is this similar to the cultural appr opriation of Native imag es and practices by the New Age movement? I will use the exam ple of one practice, \"the vision quest,\" a ritual found in Lakota culture.... When this ritual is brought into New Age context, its meaning and power are altered. The focus shifts to white people's needs and vision, which in most New Age venue s are about individual growth and prosperity. There is no accountability to a community, particularly any Native community. Rather, White people get to experience their own distorted idea of being spiritual and \"Indian,\" without any sense of responsibility which is fundamental to Native religion (Johnson, 1995). This level of exploitation and appropriation of spiritual knowledge can be referred to as the Last Frontier (Hill, 1992). A number of articles di scuss the ramifications of pop culture consumerism of ceremony and ritual historic ally attached to traditional medicinal practices. Gender Issues Related to Re-victimization In light of the current tragedy in Britis h Columbia, where over 50 women are missing or have been murdered, it is critically important to ac knowledge the existence of discrimination towards and treatment of Abor iginal women by both dominant society and some people in Aboriginal communities. The World Summit of Indigenous Women held in Mexico in December 2000, revealed that ove r 500 Aboriginal women in Canada are missing. The current status of Aboriginal wo men must be addressed within any health research of Aboriginal people ( Toronto Star , November 2002). Unfortunately the environmental scan research suggests that Abor iginal women are further victimized in their inability to access traditional medicine as a he aling tool. Cynthia Kasee's article, \"Identity, recovery, and religious imperialism: Nativ e American women and the new age,\" in Women & Therapy (1995) states: Just when a wave reconversion (back to the blanket) is taking hold among Native women substance users/abusers, the even more prevalent commercialization of Indian religion and pseudo-religion are de nigrating these recaptured sources of dignity and pride (Kasee, 1995 ). The re-victimization of Native women through their lack of econom ic means to access traditional medicine is directly related to pove rty, identity, and gender issues. There is an increasing trend where New Age, non-Native and privileged women are monopolizing a rare resource in the form of traditional practitioners, spiritual leaders and Elders. Kasee demonstrates the unequal power-relations found w ithin the New Age movement in regard to Native American women. Indigenous women need access to traditional healing due to their 19very poor health, which is identified in numerous studies on Aboriginal women (McGillvray and Comasky, 2001; Anderson, 2000) . Aldred and Johnson both explore the social injustice created by the New Age move ment and particularly, the consequences for Aboriginal women. The appropriation of culture has had impacts on tr adition as we curren tly understand it. The question of tradition and the role of wome n has become a significant debate within traditional discourse. Brant Castellano refers to testimonials given by M\u00e9tis women for the Royal Commission on Aborigin al Peoples; she states: In briefs and oral presentations to the royal commission, aboriginal women in particular cautioned against accepting trad ition at face value claims to authority asserted on the basis of tradition. Examples : \"tradition is invoked by most politicians in defense of certain choices. Women mu st always ask - Whose tradition? Is 'tradition' beyond critique? How often is tr adition cited to advance or deny our women's positions? (Women of the M\u00e9tis Nation, 1993: 25, 27). The impact of missionaries, residential schools, the Indian Act , and internalized colonialism upon several generations of women has been seve re. This impact has affected the social, political, economic and spiritual well-being of Aboriginal women. The authority and the esteemed positions that Aboriginal women held in their societies have been severely eroded. However, Indigenous women are involved in ad dressing ways to repair and rebuild their families' lives and their traditional positio ns (Alfred, 1999; Anderson, 2000; Gunn Allen, 1996). According Dorothy Rosenburg's e, \"Feminist Praxis in Transformative Learning:\" In traditional matriarchal cultures, hea ling was associated with the life giving capacities of women (Eisler, 1987). For most of human history holistic healing was practiced largely by women... For many wome n, knowledge of herbal preparations was as common as knowledge of cooking today (Greggs, 1982) ...In addition, indigenous healing practices maintained by lay women for thousands of years remain among the most important healing pr actices in most rura l parts of the world. According to WHO [World Health Organi zation], these practic es provide 95 per cent of the world's needs... (Die, Hall: 7; Rosenburg: 140 and 147). The conscious or subconscious adoption of we stern patriarchal ideo logies by Indigenous Peoples cannot be measured, but is worth acknowledgment. The best indicator of how patriarchy has transformed tr aditional Indigenous systems is measurable by analyzing Indigenous women's economic st atus and social standing. This has been evidenced by Anderson, Gunn Allen and Mc Gillivray and Comaskey as critically poor. The text , Medicine that Walks by Maureen Lux (2001), cites numerous examples of historical records and archives documen ting the traditional medical knowledge women 20practised in Plains cultures. She cites historical accounts of McClintok's 1890s recording of a Blackfoot ceremony. Ekitowaki began to brew herbs from her medicine pouch, and while purifying herself with incense, beseeched the bison spir it to help her find the source of the disease... Her fingers danced over Stuyimi's body until she announced the illness was in his chest... she danced in imitation of the bison (Lux, 2001: 76). Lux discusses the spiritual na ture of healing in Plains culture and how one Blackfoot woman, Last Calf, contracted t uberculosis and dreamt of a cure. She was instructed to boil pitch of the lodgepole pine and drink the br ew. She was recorded as vomiting profusely until her chest was cleared. Last Calf's reme dy was widely used for tubercular cough. Lux also elaborates on the high social standing of Plains midwives and how they not only performed prenatal care, but also postnatal ca re for the woman and her child months after the baby was born. Sarah Carter's article, \"First Na tions Women in Prairie Canada\" in Women of the First Nations (1996), elaborates on the traditional medi cinal knowledge of Prairie Aboriginal women as widespread. Historical written documentation by local doctors suggests that medical doctors and settlers' use of trad itional midwives and healers was a common practice in the frontier. She cites a number of examples of Indigenous women assisting medical doctors with births for Native and non-Native women alike, \"administering brew for jaundice and other ailments\" (Carte, 1996: 62). A passage Carter cites from the archives of 1880, brings to life Aboriginal women's historical role in healing: The Indian woman took in the situation at a glance. She pushed aside the terrified mother and picked up the ailing child. By signs she indicated hot water from the kettle on the stove. Into it she put a pi nch of herbs from the pouch slung around her waist. She cooked a brew and forced some of it between the blue lips of the infant. Soon the gasping subsided, and a sweat br oke to cool the fevered skin. The baby relaxed into a peaceful sleep. Cradled in the arms of the crooning Indian women... That mother to her dying day rema ined grateful (Carter, 1996: 63). Sarah Carter also notes that Aboriginal women were both formally and informally marginalized through legal, social and ec onomic intrusion. Colonialism's impact on Indigenous women's role in traditional me dicine/ceremonial has not been addressed specifically by any of the literature. This notif ies us of a gap in th e traditional medicine literature, historically often generated by Eurocentric male patriarchal writers who dismissed women's work altogether (Sm ith, 1999; Anderson, 2000; Gunn Allen, 1986; Rosenburg, 2000). Elder and healer Rose Auger states in Dianne Meili's Those Who Know: Profiles of Alberta's Native Elders (1991): 21Part of this waking up means replacing women to their rightful place in society. It's been less then one hundred years that men lost touch with reality. There's no power or medicine that has all the force unless it's balanced. The women must be there also, but she has been left out! When we s till had our culture, we had balance. The women made ceremonies, and she was rec ognized as being united with the moon, the earth, and all forces on it. Men have taken over. Most feel threatened by holy women. They must stop and remember the loving power of their grandmothers (Auger in Meili, 1991: 25). Today, a sensitive debate is taking place acro ss the continent about women's roles in ceremonies. There are Elders, healers and spir itualists who do not allow women in healing ceremonies, pipe ceremonies or other spirit ual activity. Gender issues should also be explored when researching and wr iting about traditional medicine. Where Traditional Medicine, Identi ty and Faith Healing Intersect The literature from the United States suggests there are a number of di stinct developments that have occurred within Indigenous healing practices. The first change we will examine is the central role the Native American Church has taken in caring for the health and well- being of Native Americans. There have been several American studies examining the influence of faith-based healing. The articles , \"Big and Little Moon Peyotism as Health Care Delivery Systems\" (Weidman: 1990) and \"T he Indian Shaker Church Anonymous: Revitalistic Curing Cults\" (Slagle and Weible-Orl ando, accounts of spiritual-based belief systems inte rsecting with health care delivery. Slagle and Orlando describe in their paper, how the Indi an Shaker Church, a century-old, intertribal religious movement and curing cult, functions as a culture-based alcoholism intervention [system] (Slagle and Orlando, 1986: 10). The concept of identity plays a key role in the delivery of health care, especially if individuals do not identify with \"traditiona l as in pre-contact ceremonies, ritual and beliefs.\" The authors describe the Hands ome Lake movement among the Iroquois as a reformative movement that addressed modern issues of alcoholism and family violence that previous traditions had not specifically targeted. The authors position new adaptations of traditions as both reformative and revi valistic. Again, the Native American Church movement, which dates back to 1885, is describe d as an intertribal re ligion with Christian elements (Weidman, 1990: 371). The Native Amer ican Church, like its Shaker counterpart, has remained dedicated to curing and sobrie ty and historically has been involved in substance abuse treatments in the USA. Elizabeth Lewton's dissertation, \"Living Harmon y: The transformation of self in three Navajo religious healing traditions\" (1998), is an in-depth examination of healing traditions and the self-transformations that they lead to in health. All the authors agree that adaptations of revivalist movements by some members of a community must be accepted 22in the delivery of health care. They also agre e that traditional ceremonies and practices are largely ineffective in treating substance abuse or family violence and rape. The church or curing cults have intervening status that does not co-exist well with traditional ethics. Many of the faith-based healing practices are e ffective in the treatment and intervention of substance abuse and violence, and the religious practitioners continue to work with health care personnel and staff (Ibid, 1998). Identity then becomes an issue of trad itional medicine and healing. Waldram's study, conducted in Saskatoon with 147 Aboriginal pe ople, found that there were a number of factors that influenced the i ndividuals' choice and usage of traditional medicine. Waldram identified at least six dist inct cultural groups in Sask atoon. One group in the study had concerns over the use of \"bad\" medicine. If th ere is a differentiating characteristic between traditional medicine and biomedicine, it is th e duality that many Indigenous groups believe exists in \"medicine.\" Respondents to the ques tionnaire clearly indica ted that they would use a traditional healer, but the issue of \"bad medicine\" is a complex belief that clearly demarcates traditional medicine from west ern biomedicine (Waldr am, 1990). Also, people who have adopted a variety of beliefs, such as Pentecostalism, Catholicism and other organized religious beliefs, would not s upport traditional ritual healing. Religious affiliation, however, may not prevent all the people from accessing specialty services outside of the ceremonial realm within traditional medicine, such as herbalism and midwifery. Evolving Tradition In the USA, the changing nature of disease has led to alterations in traditional ceremonies and medical practices. For example, the Indi an Health Service conducted several focus groups with Elders and spiritua l leaders in order to address the growing concerns over the impact of AIDS/HIV in Sundance ceremonies. The Elders agreed to have the person who cuts or handles the offering of flesh wear su rgical gloves and use st erilized razors and needles. The Indian Health Service office provides free gloves, razors and needles during the Sundance season (Looking Horse, 1996). Among some other changes which have been adopted, Vision Quest, Sundance and other fasting ceremonies now allow di abetics to access needles and a base supply of sugar (Ibid., 1996). The Indian Health Service has provided a lo cal process to assist Elders and spiritual leaders to find solutions to modern challeng es and \"simply assists them by providing their health needs\" (Ibid., 1996). In summary, the overview of traditional medicine provided a glimpse into the myriad complex conceptual interdisciplinary and ge ocultural issues emerging from traditional medicine. Even the term \"traditional medicin e\" begs for introspection and interrogation; the danger was raised of adapting a colonial co ncept that inherently denigrates the validity and value of Indigenous knowledge. The need to investigate the spectrum of issues - from 23intellectual property rights, de finitions, gender, and authenti city, to the exploitation and protection of traditional medicine - is nested in the creation of an Indigenous framework. The needs of M\u00e9tis, Inuit and First Nations ar e diverse, but remain closely interwoven in many areas, including gender, the matter of articulating holistic medicine, and cultural survival. The \"ethnoscience,\" or ecological natu re of traditional medicine, guides us to pose research questions regardi ng globalization's impact on trad itional medicinal practices. The diversity of Indigenous Peoples' cultures and histories should not be presented as a barrier but as an opportunity to demonstr ate the strength of plural knowledges in contemporary contexts. 24SECTION II ELDERS AND HEALERS PROV IDE DIRECTION IN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE An Analysis, Summary and Recommendation s of Elders/Healers Consultation Summary of Recommendations The environmental scan assisted in identifying key issues related to traditional medicine. The next phase for NAHO was to begin a two-tier strategy to both dialogue with community about traditional medicine and establish focus groups, workshops and interactive healers study groups to provide both direction and feedback. From January 2002 through to December 2002 Elders and healers were asked to gather and offer their wisdom in guiding the development of the traditional medicine component. NAHO partnered with local Aborigin al organizations across the c ountry and attended several Elders' gatherings requesting input. Informa tion was gathered at conferences, gatherings and hosted workshops across Canada with Elders and healers. The first of these series of interactions took place at Prince Albert's Elders Council Meeting in Saskatchewan, Spiritual Unity 26 th Annual Elders' Conference, Brentwood Bay, B.C., the Treaty Six Elders Council, Big Island Lake Saskatchewa n, an interactive Elde rs Study Group at Six Nations and Anishnawbe Health, Toronto, a nd an Elders and Healers Workshop, Nova Scotia. The direction and guidance from the consulta tion process with Elders and healers are analyzed by identifying the most common asse rtions and direction given by a diverse group of Elders and healers. Also, a summary of their views will pr ovide a framework for their recommendations and direction. It was made clear that Elders and healers we re uncomfortable with the term \"traditional medicine.\" They expressed various views re garding the English term and thought it was not an Indigenous concept. For lack of a better term, they pursu ed identifying what traditional medicine was, and is today. Traditio nal medicine is seen as a way of life and a collective dynamic. It is spiritual, expressed through the land and ceremonies, and therefore holistic. Definitions included everything from di et, lifestyle, identity, knowledge of language and culture and expressions of love and comfort (hugging and smiling), positive verbal reinforcement, herbal and ri tual knowledge, and spiritual doctoring. In short, traditional medicine is connected to all spheres of human activity and good medicine is laughter, good thoughts and a goo d state of being. Elders a nd healers were frequently reminding one another that it is not a west ern \"medical\" concept disconnected from culture, families and community. The nebulous term \"traditional medicine\" fell sh ort of engaging the full spectrum of Elders and healers' identification of its richness a nd complexity. Several warned NAHO and other health services not to transform traditional medicine into a western biomedical model by reducing it to the moment of interaction betw een healer and individua l and a \"treatment.\" 25Rather, many Elders/healers asserted the n eed to protect the sp iritual foundation of traditional medicine as an ongoing healing journe y of an individual in his/her pursuit in acquiring restoration and balance. Secondly, education and children were a key theme brought up in a multitude of ways. A) COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND DECOLONIZATION OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE 1. Indigenous medicine and knowledge are colonized First and foremost, there was a general cons ensus that throughout history, Eurocentric education curriculums and residential schools regarded Indigenous knowledge as unscientific and superstitious. Further, the consensus is that In digenous knowledge of medicine has suffered even greater stigmati zation through missionaries, and through Indian agents who successfully outla wed ceremonies from being practised in 1884, and even jailed many political and spiritual leaders up until the mid-1900s (Cummins and Steckley, 2000). A century of persecuting Indigenous Pe oples' spiritual practices has left many communities traumatized and fearful of traditional beliefs, practices and medicine. The most consistent request was for NAHO and \"e ducated\" people to work towards restoring the respect and honour of Indi genous knowledge and medicines. The \"de-stigmatization\" of traditional medicine is critical since its e ssential philosophy is the belief system of the individual, and the individual's subsequent wil lingness to take responsibility for his or her own well-being. Secondly, many leaders, health care providers and ot her decision makers in the community do not respect traditional medicine; it is tole rated and/or its practitioners humoured. The need to assist in nurturing a healthy respect for tr aditional medicine by health care providers/leaders and community is essential. 2. Reaching the Children in Schools \"Our children were taken from us, we need to get their minds back\" (B.C. Elder). There were numerous acknowledgments that the children are no l onger being taught by their grandparents and are ther efore unable to respect Indige nous knowledge of medicines. Also, Elders and healers considered school s to be a primary place to begin teaching children healthy lifestyle habits and attitudes. The high rates of diabetes in children were a common concern and a few noted that schools were often bringing in pizza, hot dogs and candy for sale as fund-raisers. A few Elders thought school is wh ere they should be learning about good diets and traditional knowle dge of medicines. There were several grandmothers who expressed concern about lo w self-esteem, suicide and self-destructive behavior that may be due to the lack of love and positive encouragement in the schools. One Elder suggested that they be recrui ted as volunteers to work in schools as grandmothers and offer the children emotiona l and psychological support. She felt Elders were underutilized by thei r educational and health systems; this would also restore their 26traditional roles as mentors, offer them something positive to do and provide higher self- esteem. 3. Create a space in which Elders/healers can enhance their skills and knowledge \"We want to learn too, we missed out, we w ould like to know more as Elders, we need to learn and we can pass it on\" (Dene Elder, Prince Albert). Several Elders and healers r eally enjoyed the workshops a nd especially the interactive study group. Each suggested that NAHO develop wa ys that they could continue their input into, and discussions of this very important i ssue. They expressed a desire to maintain a relationship with NAHO and work towa rds networking, conferencing and ongoing dialogue with one another. The suggestion did arise to find a place e ither in educational institutions or health institutions, to \"learn from other healers, develop our knowledge base and skills; doctors get to learn about th e latest diseases and cures, why can't we ?\" (Six Nations). Professional and intell ectual development was a key finding in the workshops, since it has been trad itionally assumed that we will learn from Elders, not that they would like to learn from one another. El ders and healers discu ssed how reciprocity is better than payment for services; they believe that structurally, they deserve greater consideration than what is currently given by health and education services. 4. Create an educational space for western biomedicine, naturopathic and traditional medicine to learn together They throw them all in one place toge ther and they never learned about each other's ways, so of course they don't understand, they need to learn each other's ways before they get these health centres\" (Ojibway and Cayuga Elders, Six Nations). Another educational directive involved the sensitivity that many Elders felt towards alternative medicine models; several identified naturopathic medicines as more compatible with traditional medicine. They felt that the problem of healing centres, which were finding it difficult for the three approaches to me dicine to work together, was due to these approaches' lack of knowledge of each other \"and then there [sic] thrown together and expected to work together and that's not going to happen, they need to be educated in the same place, to learn how to really work together (Interactive Study Group). Also, many felt naturopathic approaches held promise fo r improving the quality of life for Aboriginal people because they incorporate the holistic m odel and do not \"just medicate the problem.\" Lastly, support for alternative medicine is key, given the emotional, psychological, and physical trauma experienced by so many Aborig inal people. This trauma is normally not incorporated by biomedical pract itioners who discount the histor ical context from which ill health arises. For example, internal check- ups for Aboriginal women can be traumatizing due to early experiences of sexual abuse. Alternative medi cine would accommodate such emotional barriers to check-ups. 27 \"Our native women have had many bad things happen to them, they can't stand to be touched, like a massage is even traumatizing, we need to re- learn good touch and bad touch, so other invasive things are out of the question! (Healer: Mohawk, Six Nations). 5. Mentorship between Youth and Elders Another key theme to emerge from the cons ultations is the loss of Indigenous knowledge pedagogy of experiential learning and apprenti cing with medicine people as helpers. The Elders/healers felt that they were losing valuable knowledge because there was no interest from youth in learning Indigenous knowledge or pursuing careers as medicine people. It was suggested that schools could credit young people for apprenticing with Elders. NAHO's role could be to facili tate a data bank that would have students interested in traditional medicine and then match th em with interested Elders/healers. \"No one is there interested in what we know, there is no way to pass it on (Mi'kmaq healer: Nova Scotia). Recommendations for Section A \u00be Development of curriculum that could be used by elementary and post-secondary schools on the topic of Indige nous knowledge and medicine. \u00be Facilitate local public awar eness campaigns about trad itional medicine and the colonial history that stigmatized it. \u00be Professional development and conferenci ng of healers/Elders through accessing universities, health facili ties and stakeholders of Indigenous knowledge and medicine that support the Elde rs/healers' desire to enhanc e their skills, learn from one another and devel op solid networks. \u00be Development of incentive policies for medi cal universities, alternative therapies, naturopath colleges and Aboriginal post -secondary institutes to work towards medical programs that would expose student s to diverse approaches to medicine. \u00be Development of a national database of community-identified Elders/healers and students in the health and sciences progr ams and related career fields. Find a process to match the student with the appropriate mentor. \u00be A national Conference on Traditional Medi cine with Elders, healers, academics, and physicians. The need for informati on sharing and developing relationships among healers and Elders, in conjunction w ith western-trained health professionals may raise awareness and facilita te understanding and learning. \u00be Conferences with Aboriginal primary and secondary school s with urban principals, teachers and administrators which would raise awareness of their role in preventative care through educat ion, and instill a healthy respect for their heritage and cultures. The second focus is developi ng role model literatur e and lectures in the areas of health care to inspire children to consider pursuing careers in health. 28 B) Intellectual Property Rights \u0089 Developing appropriate policies and protection for Indigenous knowledge. The ownership of all information collected fr om Elders and healer s would belong to the communities. This is critical in developing strong relationships or \"rebuilding trust\" between NAHO, other health agencies, research ers and interested parties. The need for guidelines and policies in the area of traditional medicine is a crucial first step. \u0089 Fear of discussing traditional medicine in public. There is distrust of non-Aboriginal resear chers and Aboriginal researchers. Several Elders/healers were not comfor table with non-Natives sitting in the circle and expressed distress over exploitation of their sacred knowledge. It was reiterated several times that ethical guidelines must be developed to prev ent the further exploi tation of Aboriginal people or their knowledge. Recommendation for Section B Communities need support in developing appropriate ethical guidelines, research codes of conduct and the protection of Indigenous knowledge. Most communities are neither mandated to, or able to find the resources ne eded to develop a culturally-based Ethical Review Committee or Boards such as exist in Akwesasne. Elders/healers expressed a clear demand for assistance in finding ways to preser ve and yet protect Indigenous knowledge of medicines. C) Maintaining Indigenous Medic ine's Autonomy from the State \u0089 Government Control Another common theme throughout the discussi ons is Elders' apprehension about the government regulating traditional medicine or in some way control ling their activity. The Elders/healers highlighted the fact that it was in their recent history that these ways were outlawed, and perhaps now, the government is finding another way to control their spirituality, healing, and ceremonies. The lega l issues arising from insurance from malpractice of traditional heal ers are a very current and re al challenge for Aboriginal health facilities that have traditional medicine as a public service. Also, they felt threatened by any documenting of traditional me dicine in health facilities. \u0089 The debate of paying for traditional medicine At the heart of the discussions of autonomy for traditional medicine practitioners was identifying the exchange of m oney for traditional medical services. This they then equated to the \"buying of and therefor e loss of control\" of traditi onal medicine. The desire for traditional medicine to be recognized as a valid tool of healing often conflicted with the fear of losing the integrity of the me dicine through buying and selling traditional 29medicines, and thus losing their \"sacred\" na ture. While many of the Elders and healers agreed with the sanctioning of traditional me dicine, they disagreed on the way in which it would be made available to the public. The ke y arguments put forth rested on the notion of traditional medicine as a sacred activity that cannot be bought or sold and the modern need for traditional healers to have stable incomes to support their families. \u0089 Exploitation and Authenticity A number of Elders/healers raised concern over the people that present themselves as healers or Elders, often away from thei r own communities, and who exploit both the ceremonies and the people looking for help. S uggestions to assist Aboriginal Peoples in protecting themselves from being preyed upon by charlatans are meant to raise awareness around the appropriate conduc t of a healer or Elder. The development of codes of ethical conduct is identified as key to people protecting themselves from being abused or further exploited by those who are not au thentic healers and/or Elders. Recommendation for Section C The threat of government regulati on of traditional medicine is not only a valid fear but also one that government agencies are currently assessing. Elders and healers view NAHO as an advocate for protecting their rights as tr adition practitioners. NAH O may be useful to assist the Elders and healers in developing a policy position in the area of regulations. Like the Romanow Commission, submissions could be made at Health Canada outlining the position of Aboriginal healers and Elders. Traditional medicine as a paid profession NAHO partnering with local and regional agen cies could assist in developing several conferences with Elders and h ealers to discuss the issue of payment for services and find some resolution to the two positions. Through debate and discussion, people attending may have time to think about the short- and l ong-term impacts that traditional medicine payment may have on cultures and communities. A Guideline for ethical conduc t for traditional healers One such Guideline does exist in Colombia that was developed by healers and Elders; it may be an appropriate model to follow. The text, The Beliefs of the Elders: Codes of Ethics for Indigenous Medicine of the Colombian Amazon by The Union of Yag\u00e9 Healers of the Colombian Amazon (1999), is a model not only for its written text, but also for bringing healers and Elders together and forming a union which addre sses these issues. Elders and healers continued to discuss the need fo r networking, developing relationships, and mentoring younger people. The Amazon model may be an appropriate model to emulate in the interim of developing traditional medicine ethics guidelines. 30 The overall need for ongoing consultation with Elders and healers is primary to the traditional medicine component. The enthusiasm of Elders and healers to participate in discussions, to find solutions, and to work towa rds improving the state of Aboriginal health in Canada was overwhelming. Indigenous knowle dge which is possessed by Elders is our greatest asset and throug h the above summary of Elder/heal ers' directives and guidance, their intellectual contributions have offere d extraordinary insights that need to be implemented into policy. A Last Word The key is to continue the dialogue w ith Elders and healers and act on their recommendations and continue to seek thei r expertise and wisdom. Nye Weh to all our Elders, healers and helpers. 31BIBLIOGRAPHY Aldred, Lisa. \"Plastic Shamans and Astrotur f Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality.\" American Indian Quarterly 24, 3 (2000): 329-352.

The list includes articles from so cial work, psychology, sociol ogy, anthropology, medical and alternative medicine journals, and academic dissertations. The unit of study across all disciplines is traditional medicine. Both time and resources limit the environmental scan of academic research in the area of traditional medicine. The locati on of the relevant literature is a barrier to access and the search is time-c onsuming given the interdisciplinary nature of the research topic. The task of canvassing the literature in order to provide annotation is labour-intensive. The annotated bibliography should serve as a foundation for a desperately needed collection of research in the area of traditional medicine. The annotated bibliography will be useful for organizations, researchers, medi cal practitioners, and h ealth care providers. 36Abbott, P.J.
