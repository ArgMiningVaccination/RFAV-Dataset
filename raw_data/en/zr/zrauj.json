The additional properties of Prehnite are increased by the presence of Epidote, and other properties of Epidote are present in these crystals as well. Epidote is a stone that increases whatever it touches. Prehnite boosts prophetic abilities, enhances visualization, spiritual \"knowing,\" and aids in connecting with higher realms including your higher self as well as spiritual and extraterrestrial beings. The addition of Epidote to the Prehnite further increases perception and interaction with spiritual beings. This makes Prehnite with Epidote an excellent stone to use when working with tarot or crystal balls. Prehnite fosters a strong sense of trust in Universal Principles. As such, Prehnite stops hoarding of both possessions and love by fostering a belief in the abundance and power of the Universe to manifest whatever is needed. Lucid dreaming is induced by Prehnite, while dreams are made easier to remember and nightmares are reduced. Prehnite is said to \"heal the Healer,\" (again, Epidote enhances this), and this stone can be used to revitalize your personal healing environment. Prehnite with Epidote increases personal power, helps you to say no to unreasonable requests, clears the emotional body aura, and the Epidote can be especially helpful for enhancing your memory when looking for a lost object. Put Prehnite with Epidote in your garden to create a healing sanctuary for yourself. Use Prehnite with Epidote when working with energy grids to enhance protective fields, calm, and bring inner peace. On a more physical level, Epidote's ability to increase energy is useful in strengthening the physical body, but it also stimulates the immune system, aids in healing, and is a great stone to use for physical recovery. Prehnite clears toxins from the body and balances the meridians. "}
