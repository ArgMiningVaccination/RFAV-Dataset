The first report was brought out in 1984 as FAO/RADA publication by the same investigator. Animal health is a major concern for the small farmers of Nepal. In general, animal health and nutritional status are rather very poor in Nepal. A large population of unproductive animals along with lack of pasture grazing land have compounded the problems facing the basic animal health care delivery system. Ever since the human life started in this earth, disease and death co-existed with him and with his animals. Therefore, efforts have been made to get relief out of it using herbs in various forms as a medicine from the very beginning of the human civilization. From the time immemorial the traditional system of medicine was being practised in Nepal. Most of the traditional practitioners are not trained and the practiceswhich came down from generation to generation had, in fact, become a culture in socio-economic life of the people in this country. Traditional veterinary medicines are the least expensive,-an be locally prepared and traditionally rooted in the livestyle of the people. It should be decided to support them so that some ?ositive steps be taken up into an integrated approach with other modern veterinary services. This is the second approach to gather information on indige-nous veterinary medicine which was initiated by Dr. D.D. Joshi. the principal investigator is also to make recommendations for Luture development so that hundreds of thousands of small farmers could be benefited more from this system. This report presents the findings and a brief overall analysis of the data collected through this survey study. The number ind types of traditional veterinary practitioners or their raining and methods oftraining, information about the availibility and use of herbs, minerals and other indigenous products ire complied and tabulated in seperate chapters. iContents Page Foreword ...................................................................................................................... ...............................i Introduction................................................................................................................... ................................1 2. 3. 4. 4.2Backgroun Survey and sampling .................................................................................................... .................... 3 Findin gs ............................................................................................................................. .......................... 4 4.1 Traditional and modern pharmaceutical development ................................................................................................................... ............................... 5 Scope of indigenous sources ................................................................................................... .......................6 4.3 The use of medical plants in veterinary practices .......................................................................................................... ...............................6 Cultivation of medical (herbal) plants......................................................................................... .....................7 Collection, conservation and drying of medicinal plants............................................................................................................... .................................84.4 4.5 4.5.1 Collection ............................................................................................................... .........................................8 4.5.2 Conservation.............................................................................................................. .......................................8 4.5.3 Drying ................................................................................................................... ..........................................8 4.6 Types of traditional veterinary practices and their training and method of training ......................................9 Integration of traditional system of veterinary medicine into the modern animal health services systems ..................................................... ,.......................................... .................16 Use of herbs, minerals and other indigenous products........................................................................... .......18 Recommendations................................................................................................................ ..........................335. 6. 7.

Questionnaires Traditional Veterinary MedicinesTRADITIONAL VETERINARY MEDICINE IN NEPAL 1.Introduction: Traditional (Indigenous) means something which is commi4nicated from ancestors to descending; only by oral means. Thus the knowledge of traditional medicine both for man and animal is handed down from one generation to another through practical demonstrations or through oralcommunications. Ever since the life started on the earth, diseases and death coexisted with him and with their animals. Therefore efforts have been made to get relief out of it by using herbs in various forms as medicine from the very beginning of human civilization. From time immemorial the traditional system of medicine was being practised in Nepal. This system mostly depends on the availability of suitable local herbal drugs and medicines which brings theadvantage to the people and their animals living in the country. This traditional practices which came down from generation to generation had, infact, become a culture in the socio-economic life of the people of this country. It is well known to all that the indigenous medicinal plant products were in practices even before Gautam Budha for treatment of animal in Nepal. In Vedas the use of indigenous drugs in veterinary medicine is also mentioned. In India this type of herbal medicines started to be used during 1200 B.C. During the periodof Asoka herbal medicines were in use for the treatment of animals. It has been also described in Rigveda about animal diseases and their cure through Himalayan herbal drugs. This practice of curing diseases through herbal plant is still used by many veterinarians, medical officers, Ayurvedic physicians and local vaidyas. Therefore the practice of using herbal medicine for human and animals has remained for a long time. At present , due to introduction of the Western drugs, or allopathicdrugs, like antibiotics and sulpha-drugs, there is a great set-back of herbal medicines all over the world. Nepal is situated in the lap of the Himalayas occupying one-third of their total length. It has an exhaustless . hidden treasure of valuable herbal medicinal plants which may be considered as a natural gift forthe people of the Nepal. Since very long time, people of all economic strata have using a great number of the plants traditionally according to Ayurvedic, Homeopathic and Baidangi concepts to get rid of their own and their animals complaints. In this indigenous system of medicine there are large number of drugs of plant originwhich have recognised in the treatment of various animals and human diseases and have remained as the main source of veterinary and medical reliefs. The great majority of the people of this country are 1inclined to the system in which drugs are mostly in their crude forms. Most of the methods of treatment and the drugs used in traditional veterinary medicine are not explainable for their effectiveness at the present stage of our knowledge. The rationale use of drugs in the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment depends upon the knowledge of their desired action. Every system of medicine has its own advantages and shortcomings . The users and practitioners of the traditional system obviously would be happy to find the medicine, herb and drug locally available to them for their advantage. All the traditional medicines would eventually be given a trial as to their effectiveness, low toxicity, and quick availability. There is a great need of scientific approach,research, and authoritative interpretation of the underlying veterinary medical phylosophy and practices behind the traditional system of veterinary medicine. 2. Background: In Nepal the medical and veterinary systems are modern western medicine (allopathic medicine) homiopathy, Ayurvedic medicine, Tibetan medicine, unani medicine and traditional fait healing. The last four systems are grouped together and connoted as traditional veterinary and medical systems which is at present, generally represented by Ayurvedic veterinary/medical medicine. It is to note that the modern (allopathic)medicine was introduced in the country only at the turn of this century whereas the traditional medicine one has been existing since a long time ago and had already started its primary development activities in the country. Crude herbs and drugs are crucial in the treatment of diseases to human being as well as animals inNepal. In Nepal traditional veterinary and human medicines are still is use in various forms especially under Ayurvedic system. Herbal medicinal plants used to those medicine have reference under local names.Standard names of the plants are to be sought in Sanskrit language. It is not uncommon for a medicinal plant to have different local names in Nepal. Drugs for animal uses are made available in the country by acquiring from three channels, namely internal production, importation and donation. Proportionate share of each channel and each system of medicine in the total supply is not known. Non is known about the ratio between modern veterinary medicineand traditional veterinary medicines. His Majesty's Government concerned Ministries, semi-government institutions, private companies, foreign manufacturers' representatives, non-governmental organizations, and foreign doners of diversified sources and origins are found involved in aquiring the supplies of modern as wellas to some extent traditional herbal veterinary medicines in the country. 2According to the government animal health policy it is to provide free primary veterinary care. However, it has been observed that on the pharmaceutical distribution in rural Nepal showed that the free veterinary care is misleading. Because the people are paying many times more than what they get free. 3 Survey Design and Sampling: This report was updated this time and also covered three more new districts' information in it. The ultimate objectives of this survey study was to know the number and types of traditional veterinary practitioners in the country, their training and methods of treatments, name of drugs-herbs, minerals and otherindigenous products which are used by them, and assess their participation in rural development. Also this study aims to make the recommendations to maximise the coordination and cooperation between traditional and modern medicines. It was obviously impossible to collect all information from all the districts of the country within short period of time. Because we were interested in the overall system of animal treatment prevailing in thecountry, we selected the following municipality and villages of eight districts of the kingdom, which could give us the information on use of traditional system of treatment. The selected representative districts are as follows: Three are from Kathmandu valley, two from mid hill area, Kaski and Tanhu, other two from nothernremote Himalayan district, Darchula and Mustang and the last from plain (Terai) district, Rupendehi. Sample Districts and Municipality Name of the Districts Name of Municipality and Village 1. Kathmandu 2. Lalitpur 3. Bhaktpur 4. Kaski 5. Tanhu Nagar Municipality Khalanga Village Jhomsom Village 3Questionnaires and format were developed (See Annex I, II, III, IV and V). This time two survey staffs were recruited and given survey training on how to do survey, the objectives of the survey and compilation of data after completion of field survey. Team of two staff were send the above mentioned newdistricts and village for one months period of time. Informations were gathered from traditional practioners village leaders, government officials working in that area, local drug stores, veterinarians, pharmaceuticals, Nepal Royal Drugs Ltd., Herbal production and processing Co. and many others of the survey areas. 4. Findings: This report presents the updated findings with some more districts coverage and field survey data, herbal plants pictures and their general uses with current producers of herbal medicines. Besides modern veteinary practitioners, there are main 10 types of traditional healers serving rural people and treating their sick animals in Nepal. Except few of them, most of these types of medicinal practices are economically feasible, socially, culturally acceptable and utilise locally available indigenious resources. The main constraints of indigenous veterinary medicine are:mostly they are in crude form of herbal medicine, no knowledge of actual efficacy and no scientific background on authenticity in their lines of treatment. one of the most interesting findings from this survey is that all farmers go to the traditional veterinary practioner for their first consultation when their animal get ill. As one would except the prevalence of traditional medicine, almost 80%-85% baidangi and others. In this study it has been clearly observed that almost in every villages, Municipalities , there exist at least two or three types of traditional practitionersproviding the services to the people. Farmers to the veterinary hospital, veterinary dispensary, livestock and veterinary development centres for their second consultations. Multiple consultations, however, is very much the rule in the event of illness. But in many places of the country there is a lack of modern veterinary servicesfacilities provided by His Majesty's Government, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Livestock Development and Animal Health. Therefore, farmers have no alternate choice except consulting the locally available traditional practitioners. 44.1 Traditional and Modern Pharmaceutical Development Internal production of both the modern and traditional systems of veterinary medicine is found using imported capital goods and raw materials. Because the raw materials required for the production ofmodern (allopathic) ones are not simple herbs, metals and metallic compounds as those required for that of traditional (Ayurvedic) one. Along with animal health as well as human health policies and legal instruments, like the Drug Act (1978) to regulate, there are four ministries of HMG/N that are involved in one way or other of the implementation of pharmaceutical development in the country. These are Ministry of Health, Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation, Ministry of Industries and Ministry of Agriculture. Th,e Ministry of Health isresponsible for the supply of human allopathic and Ayurvedic drugs, the regulation and administration of drugs legislation through the Department of Drug Administration, and the production of Ayurvedic preparations (through Singh Darbar Vaidhya Khana). The Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation, thepioneering body for the development of pharmaceuticals in the country, is responsible for the operation of Royal Drug Research Laboratory (RDRL)-the body identified by the Drug Act as the legal agency for the regulation of all kinds of testing, analysis, standardisation, quality control, and research in the field ofpharmaceutical development. This ministry is also responsible for the operation and supervision of herbs processing and herbal cultivation, for the commercial cultivation and production of herbal material. The Ministry of Industries, the regulating authority for the public and private industries, is responsible for theproduction of allopathic drugs through the Royal Drugs Ltd. (RDL)-the government undertaking. To co- ordinate the implementation and operation and also to design the policies on administration and technical affairs there are, as arranged in the Drug Act, the advisory bodies, like Drug Development Council andTechnical Advisory Board, represented in the both by the ministries, operating agencies, generators, producers, distributors and users. Whereas the Ministry of Agriculture is the responsible body to look after the animal health and allied vaccine production and carries out its duties through the Department of Livestock Services,Veterinary Hospitals, Service Centres and Sub-centres. In veterinary products the HMG/N agencies under the Ministry of Agriculture is manufacturing some of the important animal vaccines. In addition to these establishments for the production of end products, there is one more government company, which under the umbrella of Ministry of Forest and SoilConservation, is cultivating and converting medicinal herbs into secondary intermediate products for home consumption and export market. How these companies and government agencies under the different umbrellas are performing economically in the transformation or conversion processes, is not yet clear. 5In respect to promotional and support resources, the general weakness of the country in technological information at the entrepreneural level for making decision on options extends also to this subsector. Furthermore the a imported products are mostly from the nation having advantadges of the mass production of overwhelming superriority in the industrial capacity. In other words, home industries of any size in the pharmaceuticals are to face the difficulties of competition with external products, and without adequate protection they are doomed to be failure in a situation of small market of the country. 4.2 Scope of the Indigenous Resources: If managed systematically with a priority programme approach there are some opportunities in the country to exploit in a manner to contribute from the indigenous resources for the pharmaceutical development to the national development objectives and goals. Proper utilization/mobilization of existing trained, skilled and semi-skilled manpower resources of such knowledge and skills is a must for the upliftmentof social, economical, technological and scientific affairs of the pharmaceutical development in the country. The second set of opportunities relates to optimum utilization of physical based indigenous resources for the internal production of pharmaceutical intermediates for veterinary medicine. The third scope of opportunities is related to the basic veterinary medical and pharmaceutical researches. The researches should have the understanding of those diagnosis and treatment principles and traditional medicines that have special niches for curing specific diseases in the traditional systems of veterinary medicine, the understanding of the inherited empirical relationship of diseases and society may besome that will help the traditional system of veterinary medicine to meet with modern principles of science and technology to protect and to promote their values. There is another consideration that to mobilise international participation and involvement in the developing country's efforts in the development of traditional veterinarypharmaceutical researches. 4.3 The Use of Medicinal Plants in Veterinary Practices: The use of medicinal plants in veterinary practices, here in Nepal, is getting more popularity. This is because of two reasons: one there is a traditional practices of using herbal plants as a medicine and seconds there are now number of 6veterinary products produced from medicinal herbs which are produced within the country as well as produced in India and imported. These drugs are available in the market in drug stores and also to some extent supplied by HMG/N Department of Livestock Services through veterinary hospitals, centres and sub-centres located inall 75 districts of the country. It is fact that modern researches have shown that the action of medicinal plants is due to a relatively small number of constituents - called the active principles - produced by the plant. It is true that for certain uses (e.g. parenteral injection) the active principles or a very carefully prepared extract is more usefulthan the drug itself. In popular traditional veterinary medicine we have the advantage of using the entire plant or one or other of its organs. It is necessary to know something about their active constituents and the effectiveness of these, in order to understand the uses of medicinal plants and their mode of action The active principles presents in a plant are very variable in amount and quantity this could be because of either plant grown in a unfavourable climate and soil which may have lower or absent of active principle orplant grown in a proper condition may have higher amount of active principles of drugs. 4.4 Cultivation of Medicinal (Herbal) Plants: Most of the medicinal plants found in Nepal are indigenious and popular. These are cultivated either in the gardens, or farms or in the jungle (forest). In order to capitalise and commercialise them one has to grow commercially in the farms. Although there is a opinion that cultivated herbal plants are less active than those collected from their natural habitats. So far the medical knowledge and research findings about theefficacy do not accept this opinion and rather it is entirely false. Herbal research studies carried out in Nepal by the research laboratory of the Department of Medicinal plant, and herbal company, also in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and many other countries of Europe have shown that cultivated plants are at least as active as thewild plants if they have been grown from good seed, sown or planted in suitable soil and grown in favourable climate. While cultivating the medicinal plants one has to consider very carefully on the following factors: a. Cultivation of such plant races with high content of active principles, b. Soil selection for cultivation or plants cultivation on the basis of the type of soil needed c. Fertilizers in the soil influence the amount of active principles of each plant 7d. Climate is also an important factor. The highest contents of active constituents are generally obtained in plants that are cultivated under conditions that approximate to their natural habitats. e. Cultivated and collected in the alpine and mountains are more efficacious than those coming fromlower altitudes. The herbal plants grown wildly in nature up in the Himalayas are very famous, not only inthe South east Asian countries but also getting popularity in western countries. This is because of having greater efficacy in the active principles of the plants. However, so far no developmental plan has been formulated to explore this important field of science, and f. Light can play a primordial part, as for example: Bella done plant collected from a sunny place contains more alkaloids than if grown in the shade. 4.5 Collection, Conservation and Drying of Medicinal Plants: 4.5.1 Collection: It must be recognised that the time of collection or harvesting the plants materials markedly influences the amount of active constituents present in the drug. In many cases it has been observed that leavesaccumulate active principles before the sun rises and these principles will be reduced during the following period, herbs should thus be collected at that time. Belladona or thorn apple are richer in active principles in the morning and than in the evening. Medicinal plants should not be collected in rainy day or wet day nor attimes when they are still covered with forest dew. 4.5.2 Conservation: Conservation of fresh herbal plants or parts of plants is generally acheived by drying, then they can be used throughout the year. 4.5.3 Drying: It is of prime importance to dry the plants as soon as possible after collection in order to avoid changes that may occur, especially in the active principles. Drying. can be done by two methods: a. Sun drying which is only possible in hot, dry climate but not in wet and humid climate. It is often said that drying -should be carried out in the shade instead of directly under sunlight. 8b. Using driers employed for fruits and vegetables, in which case the temperature must be carefully regulated. Herbal plants containing volatile oils must be dried between 20 degree centigrate to 40 degree centigrate. Whereas others between 15 degree centigrate to 80 degree centigrate. It is important to spreadthe plants in thin layers without any overlaying of different parts. Before drying it is desirable to separate leaves and flowers fro)n other unwanted plant members such as stems, which would slow down the process of drying. 4.6 Types of Traditional veterinary Practitioners and Their Training and Method of Training: The following are the list of types of traditional veterinary practitioners: 4.1 Ayurvedic or Ayurvoda or Dhami4.7 Tantirik and Mantrik (Tantra, Jantar and Mantra) 9 Their Training Methods of Treat ment 4.1.2 The basis of the treatment and diagnosis in animals is also according to Ayurvedic system to which \"Bayu\" \"Bitta\" and \"cough\" are the three factors whose imbalancein the animal body results in disease. Treatment can be by simple plant herbal drug or preparations from expensive metals and precious stones. This is a widely recognisedsystem of treatment of both in animals and human. This is the first systematic utilization of herbal plants for animal ailments and it has a very good reputation in the line oftreatment. But this system of treatment was generally centralised in main district headquarters and town panchayat areas, because the well trained experiencedAyurved practitioners (well reputed for human treatment mostly) generally stayed in the town panchayat areas. They are trained only for the treatment of human ailmentsand not for veterinary medicine but due to the same concept of traditional medicinal system they apply in animals with different doses which give very good effecton animal disease treatment. Therefore, people believe in this. Thus, farmers who are near or in the municipalities are benifited by experienced Ayurved people. Medicinalherbs/plants, which are used in this system, are listed in separate chapter.4.1 Ayurvedic or Ayurveda or Kaviraj or Vaidya4.1.1 Mostly by government institutions within the country andoutside the country, particulary in India 104.2 Homeopathic or Homeopath 4.3 Unani4.2.1 Mostly by governmental inst- tution outside the country particulary in India and few by personnelcontact, reading, correspondence and experi-ences. 4.3.1 They do not get training but by experiences and observation of the knowledge and practice handed down from generation to generation.4.2.2 This is not very much popular practised now in Nepal for animal treatment.But homoepathic medicines and treatment of domestic animals was the firstintroduction of animal treatment system officially in Nepal during the beginning of Rana Regime.The source of homeopathic medicines are herbal plants, animalproducts and minirals and nosodes also. The basis of treatment and diagnosis in animals are according to homoeopathic principles and system. \"psora, psychosisand syphilis\" (as miasmatic factors- diseases in Homeopathic system. Homeopathic is essentially notmany sided but all sided. This system investigates their action in healthy and sick animals.The principle doctrine of this science is \"similia similibus curanture\" Late Dr. Khus Bahadur was the first Homeopathic as well as veterinary doctor who has introduced and practiced this system of treatment in veterinary hospital officially in Kathmandu, Nepal, during the Rana Regime in 1929 A.D. 4.3.2 This system of treatment in animals is only practiced in Kathmandu valley and Biratnagar. Treatment can be Unani preparation of medicines along with herbal plants, minerals and natural therapy. 114.4 Sidha 4.5 Yoga 4.6 Dhami4.4.1 No training but spirits and supernatural power and agents. 4.5.1 No training officially but trained themselves locally on Yoga practice. 4.6.1 No training but byexperience and alsoprofessional which came down from generation to generation as Dhami familyin the community4.4.2 Sidha is famous by \"Sidha Ba-Ba\". They are not very common and only few Sidha located in different parts of Nepal such as in Doti-Khaptar Baba , Swargadwari baba in Peuthan, Chandan Baba in Jumla. Some Baba near and around the Lord Pasupati Nath Temple in Kathmandu. Few other Jogi Baba live in Matha of different districts ofNepal. They treat animals or advice owner of the sick animals by giving ash and few dried leaves or roots or fruits or herbs which have no any sciencetific basis, andadminister them with sacred water. Their treatments are based on dynamic or spiritual hypnotism. 4.5.2 This is not commonly practiced in animals treatment but few Yoga sutras are being applied and used to treatpet animals to give relief for few types of ailments. It is said that physiotherapy is the main basis of Yoga treatment in animals. 4.6.2 This is the most popular system of treatment of animals in the Nepalese society. About 85 % of the people and their animal population are served by this systemoccupy a major role in the animal health care of the country. They are really speaking pcychatrics and hypnotics. This system has developed deep roots in oursociety. They use sometimes herbs and few known antibiotics because they have adjusted, themselves to the new system of veterinary medicine development. Alldhamis treat animals on the following basis of diseases caused by: 124.6.2.1 Imaginative,unidenti-fied Dhami asks to the owner to secrify youth goats and fowl for curing ailments of asick animal. 4.6.2.2 Hunter disease: Which causes shooting pain like and arrow. 4.6.2.3 Nas kapat: Where they provide certain types of plants powder and bitters for causing diarrhoea to treat poisoning and indigestion. 4.6.2.4 Anger of gods and goddessess: Dhami asks to the owner to please your god and goddess (kul deveta)because he or she is angry. 4.6.2.5 Ganu Gola: Kind of tympany or gas formation in animals. This is treated by most Dhamis with massage andphysical exercise by moving animal from place to place just remove gas from the intestine. 4.6.2.6 Dewa: is believed due to when animal enters into other agriculture field or vegetable gardens and eats cropsand then that animal falls sick. Dhami treats that animal psychologically. 4.6.2.7 Kancho Bayu: A milking animal gets sick and blood comes in milk and also sometime in urine and stool. This has been brought about by the ghosts of people who have committed suicide or had unnatural death. 134.7 Jhankri or Jhakri 4.8 Jyotishi of 4.9 Bainiya or Hadibuti awshadhi pasale.4.7.1. No training but by experience and gainsfrom generation to generation in some family. 4.8.1 They get trainingin Nepal as well as in India. It is very scientific in mathe-matic calculationsfindings. 4.9.1 They do not get any training but sell the medicinal herbs and their preparation which they can identifyjust by experience from generation to generation.4.7.2 This is almost like Dhami system of treatment. This is popular in eastern part and central regions like Kathmandu valley and plain areas . The treatment of Jhakri is both psychological and hypnitics. Sometimes they alscuse some herbal medicine along with sacrifying goats or poultry or ducks. This is helpful in curing various types of animal ailments. 4.8.2 This system also occupy very important place in our society. A Jyotishi can differenciate the cause of illness such as bacteria, parasite, etc. or bad star planets of his or her fortune. If it is due to bacteria etc, they advise to treattheir animals with the help of veterinarians or Ayurved or Homeopath or Baidangi etc. If it is due to bad star or fortune they advise to worship particular gods or goddess. 4.9.2 This is practiced mostl in Kathmandu and also very few places in plain (Terai) town areas.They are mostly business people. They can use crude form ofherbs and chemical originated from plants from Nepalese rulal farmers. They prepare medicine (mixture, pasteointment, pills, tablets, etc.) for differentkinds of common diseasesboth for human and animal ailments. These Baniyas sell their preparations to the same rural farmers as well as to city people.Thecombination of medicine which they prepare and sell in very effective and acceptible to the society. It has a scientific basis , for treatment. But these Baniyas, 14they never go to the patients or sick animals house. They do not observe or dignose the case. They simply sell the medicine on the verson of a person who comes to them to buy medicine. 4.10.2 This System of treatment is mostly Humli, Jumli, Dhami and Jhankri. These Lamas go to thepatients or sick animals house,diagnose the case and prescribe some herbal medicines along with some Tantra and Mantra. This is Very much practised in Himalayan and Mid-hill regions Boksini but only by experi ence and observa tion handed down from generation to generation.4.11.2 This is done mostly by a woman pichasimi. This is the second most popular system of treatment of animals in Nepalesesociety after Dhami system. Ystem is exactly same as in Dhami and ihankri. 4.12 Sudini or Sudhini or Traditionalmid-wife4.12.1 They do not get anytraining officially but they learn by experience and observation work-ing with experienced local Sudini.4.12.2 These sudinis perform delivery of women as wellas of animals. They do not treat any animals except helping in obstructive delivery of pregnantanimals. 4.13.1 They get training locally with Ayurved kabi-raj and experienced Dhami.They get very limited know-ledge of treatment.They are not much Trained in animal treatment side.4.13.2 This Baidhangi system of treatment is a combination of Dhami and Ayurveda.They use mostly herbal medicine and sometimes also act like Dhami toremove unwanted, unidentified external objects, which cause ailmentsin They also began to use alopathic medicine like antibiotics and sulpha drugs.4.10 Lama or Awtari Lama4.10.1 They get training from the old experience in Awtari Lama.There is nosuch institutional type of training 155. Integration of Traditional System of Veterinary Medicine into the Modern Animal Health Service System The problem of veterinary drug delivery system in Nepal is vast and inherently complex, and has placed serious limitations on the effectiveness of the entire animal health and livestock development programmes. This problem affects many person involved from managers of the animal health services system to the community animal health and extention leaders in the village munucipility wards. Without veterinary medicine essential for basic animal health care it becomes increasinglydifficult for animal health workers and personnels to win the confidence of animal owners and to persue the greater task of preventive veterinary medicine through animal health education and extension. Since it appears highly unlikely that there will be single ultimate solution to this problem, appropriate alternative need to be initiated and tested locally so that a basis may be established to proceed to the challenge of that task.4.14 Tantrik and Mantrik4.14.1 They get training locally with some experienced Tantrik and also they read books on Tantra and Mantra.4.14.2 In this system they use \"Jantar\" and \"Mantars\" to remove the evil spirit which is very common in our society. \"Bhut Jharne\" or offering sacrifices to pleasegods or planets and stars are commonly practised by our traditional veterinary medical workers. They use claws of bear, tiger, tusk of elephants , old silber or gold coins, thread with coral bids and other bids. They tie up round the neck of the animals or on the tail of the sick animals. This is a kind of psychosomatic methods of treatment inanimals. Some time they ask the animal owner to sell the sick animal to-low caste family to remove the evil spirit. This practice is more acceptable to the villagers becausethese types of practitioners live with them, eat their food, believe in the social cultural and religious background of the community and provided health care to both human and animal health. 16Development programme of local traditional veterinary medicine could be a modest start toward the development of local alternatives of animal health care delivery at the village level in Nepal. This concept of appropriate animal health technology has many precedents in Asia, like \"barefoot veterinarydoctors\" in China. Any success of these development models undoubtedly must be attributed to how country specific they became to design and implementation. Considering that traditional veterinary medicine is least expensive, can be locally prepared and this system of treatment is traditionally rooted in the life style of the people, His Majesty's Government ofNepal must decide to integrate this traditional system with modern veterinary medicine and develop two systems simultaneously rather than separately. A plan has to be formulated for training and extension so that traditional medicines are -effectively incorporated into the services by the modern veterinary dispensary andlivestock development and veterinary sub-centres. If this kind of integrated approach could be implemented, it will help considerably in solving the problem of drug delivery mechanism in Nepal. In countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Mongolia and Indonesia traditional system of medicine for primary health care is still widely used and practised. But in Nepal this system of veterinary medicine is not widely used and practised in an organised and scientific manner. Nepal should put up its efforts to promote and develop, and review traditional system of veterinary medicine(TSVM) according to country local needs. In doing so, arrangement of studies should be made in such a way that whatever is weak in the system it should be implemented and strengthened by strong points of other system or systems. This will lead to the application of modern tools and technologies for the full advantageand advancement of TSVM. The traditional healers are not trained academically. The techniques and methods of their clinical practices are very much crude and have no scientific basis. Thus they should get a kind of short term training courses with the objectives to enable them to identify, collect and preserve approved medicinal plants. They should also be taught how to prepare simple decoctions, syrups and ointments using the approved medicinal plants, chemicals and local materials. They should further learn how to use these preparations safely and effectively as well as when their use should be avoided. Once found to be effective,this approach will go for a long way in solving the problem of lack of medicines for common animal illness in the remote and rural areas of the country. 176. Use of Herbs, Minerals and other Indigenous Products: There are large number of herbal plants that are known to the local people as medicinal herbs. Many of them are used as medicine by our people in the country-side under the traditional method of curing the animal diseases. Even after introductions of Allopathic medicines in the area, particularly in the countries of Himalayan range, the use of medicinal plants in veterinary medicine is still commonly practised. Indigenous medicines have been prepared from various herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, bark, whole plant, seeds, leaves, root bark, stem, minerals and extracts in different manners with different compositions and forms. These medicines have diverse uses such as stomachic and tonic powder, foodsupplement, astringent powder, cough powder, broad-range and parasiti cide. From the survey study, some of the most commonly and widely grown medicinal plants, which are used for veterinary medicine in the Himalayas and Joshi 1979). Nepal exports a number of crude plant drugs to several countries. Traditional veterinary medicinal plants are, therefore, an important natural resource of our country. Measures like conservation of rare species, systematic cultivation of economically profitable species and control of deforestation can greatly help increase this resource.

List of chemicals of plants origin and other chemicals uses in veterinary medicine is prepared in Annex II . List of homeopathic medicines and homeopathic treatment of domestic animals is shown in Annex III (Raat Van 1948 and Purscll 1911). Unani treatment of domestic animals with unani medicines is shown in Annex IV. In Nepal, Royal Drugs Limited is the only recognized industry where medicinal herbs are being processed into medicines in different forms. These products are particularly meant for human medicine,and not for veterinary medicine. Although Nepalese veterinarians are prescribing some of these products for small animal diseases, which seems to be veryeffective and economic. Medicinal herbal pants are also grown in different His Majesty's Government Herbal Farms in Nepal (See Annex V). In India there are registered and well recognised industries such as the Indian Herbs Research and Supply Co. (Regd.) and Bhartiya Bootee Bhawan (Regd.) whose products are sold and used very effectively here in Nepal. Probably these types of herbal products can be produced in Nepal by Royal Drugs Limited in the future. 327. Recommendations: Considering the rich trove of traditional veterinary medicines indigenous to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region as a whole and the glaring lack of adequate moderrn facilities,for the animal population and also majority of the peoples of the region it has been observed that there is a common felt need for pulling resources to provide animal health coverage to the maximumnumbers of animals as well as numbers of small farmers. SAARC has a special obligation to develop appropriate. measures to promote and develop traditional veterinary medicines in the region. It is imperative that each number state of the SAARC promote and develop the indigenous veterinary medicine that areextensively used in the region. In addition, given the necessary funds and facilities, it can be an effective answer in filling the glaring gap in animal health facilities between the urban commercial farmings and small farmers of the rural areas. veterinary practitioners of this system use ingredients that are indigenous and canbe procured in large quantities. Hence, by developing this system the nations of the region particularly Nepal would not only be preserving their/her rich veterinary traditions but, would also be saving huge amounts of the scarce foreign exchange flowing out yearly in importing modern veterinary medicines. His Majesty'sGovernment of Nepal should provide funds and measures for the development and preservation of the traditional veterinary medical system which promises considerable benifits to the 93 percent of whole Nepal population who are farmers and keeping animals and birds for their livelihood. 7.1 The traditional veterinary medicines should be recognised, legalised and developed as an integral branch of whole veterinary medicine. There should be free dialogue and interaction between themodern veterinary practitioners and traditional veterinary medical workers for final integration between the two. 7.2 For promotion of veterinary medicines, all theveterinary stockman,veterinary supervisors,junior technical assistant (JTA) and Junior Technician (JT) of the country would be given an orientation intraditional systemofveterinary medicine since most trained animal health workers are not well trained in conceptal aspects of this systems.It will be desirable to prepare a list symptomology pertaining to each disease. They sould be trained in identification of simple remedies, their collection, preparationand its proper use. 7.3 Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science should teach at certificate and diploma level in traditional (Indigenous) Ayurvedic system of veterinary medicine at the earliest possible date. 337.4 Traditional veterinary workers as mentioned above who are working in the villages should also have basic knowledge of modern veterinary medicine. Short-term training programmes should be conducted at the district or zonal or regional level for them. 7.5 Pharamcopia of early available safe and effective remedies used in the traditional systems of veterinary medicine should be developed. A list of herbs and drugs available in the country should be prepared. The drug should be those which are commonly used and available in the rural areas for the animal disease remedies of the small farmers. Since in most of the drugs are of herbal origin, it wouldbe necessary to identify them botanically recommend the method of collections, storage processing and manufacture on standardised quality control procedure. 7.6 Since animal health is one of the important elements of the ruralcommunity for the small farmers economy, the traditional system of veterinary medicine would be desirable to be included as the most commonly used traditional remedies for animal health promotion. 7.7 To encourage cultivation of medicinal plants according tc suitability of soil, altitude, climate and rainfalls. Rear their crop in the proper, maturing season and make then available fresh or dried andpreserve them from under hygienic conditions. 7.8 To explicate the existing forest resources for collection of drug plants through the forest contractors and collectors. Also to advise the forest department in intensivE cultivation of some of the suitableand successful specie of medicinal plants. 7.9 To encourage the public in general, farmers and gardeners, in particular and the private suppliers to grow more forest plants by supplying them seeds, seedling and cutting, etc. at proper season. 7.10 To encourage traditional veterinary practitioners for preparation of the drugs and ensure some incentive to them. 7.11 Research and development of medicinal plants for clinical evaluation and utilization in both processed as well as semi-processed forms. 7.12 Nepal should prepare a comprehensive plan foropromotion and utilization of traditional veterinary medicine in anima health care. Collaboration and assistance may be needed frog international and bilateral agencies in the ,followinc areas:- 34- Training through fellowship, seminar, workshop, study groups. - Exchange of experties through short term consultant (STC) and other technical co-operation among developing countries (TCDC) mechanism. - Exchange of informations through documentation, journal, intercountry seminars. - Promoting research. - Assisting in setting up manufacturing unit assisting in production of traditional pharmaceutical preparations for use in health care. 35References Bajracharya, M.B.
