Kirkpatrick, Robin O. Lyda, Kimberly M. Frank The Science and Conservation Center, ZooMontana, Billings, MT, USA Introduction While elective contraception of domestic animals can be traced back hundreds of years, more recent con- traceptive research has been almost universally asso- ciated with human applications. However, in the past 40 years a new application has arisen, involving certain species of both domestic animals1and wild- life.2In the past decade, increased public concern over unrestrained dog and cat reproduction has stimulated a great deal of research in this area, and issues such as the prevention of pregnancies in feed- lot cattle have even brought the commercial agricul- tural community into the world of contraceptive research.3A few of these activities, however, provide methods that are directly applicable to non-domesti- cated animals. Not surprisingly, wildlife contracep- tion involves a number of diverse challenges notseen with either human contraception or domestic species. With regard to wildlife contraception, four com- monly referenced case studies include wild horses (Equus caballus ), ( Bison bison ). There are other examples but these stand out with regard to free-ranging wildlife. A growing number of non-domestic species housed in zoos and wild ani- mal parks could also be included. With rare excep- tion, all are medium to large mammals. Efforts at controlling wildlife overpopulation by means of contraception began as early as the 1950s, and most research involved natural and synthetic steroids, or a variety of non-steroidal compounds.4-6 Virtually all of these early attempts, whileKeywords Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, immunocontraception, porcine zona pellucida, wildlife Correspondence Jay F.

Contraceptive vaccines for Reprod Immunol 2011; 66: 40-50 doi:10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01003.xWildlife, free-ranging and captive, poses and causes serious population problems not unlike those encountered with human overpopulation. Traditional lethal control programs, however, are not always legal, wise, safe, or publicly acceptable; thus, alternative approaches are necessary. Immunocontraception of free-ranging wildlife has reached the manage- ment level, with success across a large variety of species. Thus far, the immunocontraceptive research and management applications emphasis have been centered on porcine zona pellucida and gonadotropin-releas- ing hormone vaccines. Contraceptive success has been achieved in more than 85 different wildlife species, at the level of both the individual ani- mal and the population. At the population management level with free- ranging species, the primary focus has been on wild horses, urban deer, bison, and African elephants. The challenges in the development and application of vaccine-based wildlife contraceptives are diverse and include differences in efcacy across species, safety of vaccines during pregnancy, the development of novel delivery systems for wild and wary free-ranging animals, and the constraints of certain non-contracep- tive effects, such as effects on behavior. Beyond the constraints imposed by the public and a host of regulatory concerns, there exists a real limi- tation for funding of well-designed programs that apply this type of fer- tility control.REVIEW ARTICLE American Journal of Reproductive 40 \u00aa2011 John Wiley & Sons A/Spharmacologically successful, ended in failure, for a variety of reasons including toxicity, passage throughthe food chain, adverse effects on social behaviors,high cost of application, difculty in delivering thecompounds remotely, health risks in pregnant ani- mals, and a host of regulatory issues. Of course, the constraints within these early approaches varieddepending on the species. For example, remotedelivery was not a requirement for captive exoticspecies, and behavioral changes were of less impor-tance in urban deer, which were viewed as 'pests' insome quarters. Conversely, remote delivery is a vir-tual requirement for free-ranging wildlife, and behavioral changes would not be tolerated in social animals such as wild horses and African elephants.Thus, each species and setting brings with it specicneeds and limitations. The cumulative effect of allthese issues resulted in the realization that contra-ception with steroid hormones, the method of choicefor humans and dogs, was not acceptable across thebroader spectrum of wildlife. Steroids remain useful in some captive wildlife contraception efforts but have been abandoned for use in free-ranging wild-life. It was only with the advent of practical immuno- contraception that signicant progress in free-rang-ing wildlife contraception occurred. Immunologicalapproaches were considered for use in wildlife asearly as 1987 7and the earliest recorded attempts at wildlife immunocontraception included a gonadotro- pin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine tested inwild horses on 8Shortly thereafter, a porcine zona pellucida (PZP) vaccine was tested in domestic and captivewild horses. 9The results of the GnRH trial were not promising, while the PZP trial provided clear evi-dence that an immunocontraceptive could success- fully inhibit fertility in equids. In relatively rapid succession, trials with PZP were successful in captivewhite-tailed deer 10-12and a variety of zoo animals, africana ) (J. F. Kirkpatrick, unpublished data). Identifying an effective vaccine was only the ini- tial step in developing a population management forwildlife. Very early it was recognized that the majorchallenges in wildlife contraception included (i) identifying successful contraceptive agents in captiveanimals, (ii) documenting safety associated with suc-cessful agents, (iii) developing a means of deliveringthese agents to free-ranging wildlife, and (iv) actu- ally altering populations. With the success of PZP- induced fertility control in captive animals, whichaddressed the rst of the four challenges, the nextand more challenging step was the implementationof actual eld trials with free-ranging animals. Whilethe strategy remained the same, this represented amajor change in tactics and one that is still under-appreciated. Fortunately, one of the major advanta- ges of immunocontraception became obvious during captive animal trials, which was the ability to delivercontraceptive doses in very small volumes, whichcould be delivered remotely. This is now recognizedas a key requirement for practical wildlife contracep-tion. The rst eld trial of wildlife PZP immunocontra- ception occurred on Assateague Island National Sea- shore, a barrier island off the coast of Maryland 23 years ago. This trial proved successful in inhibit-ing fertility in wild horses. 15Aside from demonstrat- ing a high degree of contraceptive efcacy, thisinitial study proved beyond a doubt that the vaccinecould be delivered remotely, without any handlingof animals. It also demonstrated the safety of thevaccine in pregnant animals 15and that fertility inhi- bition could be maintained with annual booster inoculations.16 The rst eld trial with white-tailed deer occurred at the Smithsonian Institute's Conservation andResearch Center at Front Royal, VA. 17Deer were captured, tagged, and given a primer dose of PZPand then released. Subsequent booster inoculationswere given remotely via small 1.0 cc darts. As with earlier captive trials, the vaccine proved efcacious (85%) and remote delivery proved successful. In thecase of both the wild horse and deer eld trials, ani-mals received a 65- to 100- lg primer dose emulsied with Freund's complete a 100- lg PZP emulsied with Fre- und's incomplete adjuvant (FIA). The rst eld trialwith free-ranging African elephants occurred in 1996, in the Kruger Park, in South Africa. Animals were immobilized from a helicopter, given ultra-sound examinations to determine pregnancy status,collared and hand injected with a 600- lg primer dose of PZP + a component of Ribi /C210adjuvant.18Sub- sequent booster inoculations occurred by remoteCONTRACEPTIVE VACCINES Journal of Reproductive Immunology 66(2011) 40-50 \u00aa2011 John Wiley & Sons were positive but efcacy was lower (75%) than with horses and deer. A change ofadjuvants, to comple- of these trials, management level application of the PZP vaccine has been successful in altering entire populations, stopping population growth and evendecreasing populations, of wild horses, 21urban deer,22wapiti,23and African elephants.19,20 Safety At this point, attention turned to safety issues. The questions at hand were (i) did PZP alter ovarian function, (ii) were the contraceptive effects revers-ible, (iii) were there adverse behavioral effects ofPZP immunocontraception, and (iv) were there anyshort- or long-term adverse physical side effects? A major advantage of zona proteins as immuno- gens is the absolute lack of cross-reactivity withother tissues and protein hormones. 24-26Addition- ally, the site and mechanism of action (see Clark and Dell27for an eloquent discussion of the mecha- nism of action supporting zona vaccines) is as far'downstream' for most of the reproductive processesas possible, such that the sequelae of reproductiveevents that are disrupted are inconsequential. This isessential for wildlife species but may be considered adisadvantage if the target animals are domestic spe- cies, such as dogs and cats, where extinguishing undesirable behaviors is as much a goal as contra-ception. The safety of PZP immunocontraception was con- rmed for horses, deer, and elephants through a ser-ies of follow-up investigations. Ovarian endocrinefunction was monitored in treated wild mares viaurinary steroid metabolites, 28and it was shown that there were no permanent or signicant changes in ovarian endocrine parameters and estrous cyclicityeven after long-term treatment. 29-31This is consis- tent with the accepted theory of the mechanism ofaction of zona proteins. 32Later studies in wild horses conrmed the safety of PZP use in pregnantmares 33,34and reversibility of contraceptive action, at least through ve consecutive years of treat- ment,33demonstrated increased body condition35 and increased longevity in mares treated chroni- cally,36and no signicant changes in fundamental social organization or behaviors.37Two more recent studies found that PZP treatment resulted in lessband delity among treated mares outside the breed-ing season 38and minor changes in time budgets among treated mares.39However, the former study was not controlled for pregnant animals or maresthat had foals removed annually. The latter studyfound that most behavioral changes were associated with changes in body condition or the presence of foals. Considering that untreated mares have morefoals than treated mares, and that treated maresdevelop better body condition than untreated mares,small changes in time budgets would be expected.Ultrasound examinations of ovaries and uteri fromPZP-treated elephants also revealed a lack of nega-tive effects. 18,20 While no long-term negative health effects were detected in PZP-treated wild horses, there was someconcern over injection site reactions. Because of thehomology of the zona glycoproteins across manymammalian taxon groups, PZP is a poor immuno-gen. Thus, a powerful adjuvant is necessary andbetween 1988 and 1998, FCA was the adjuvant ofchoice for initial inoculations, followed by booster inoculations of PZP + FIA. In reality, as long as inoc- ulations were given in the rump or hip, injection sitereactions were uncommon; however, there was con-cern over causing false tuberculosis-positive testsamong some species of animals treated with FCA(there is no TB test for equids; thus, this was not aproblem in these species). As a result, for initialinoculations, a new adjuvant was utilized with PZP in wild horses, and later among other species as well. FMA, which utilizes the fractionated cell wallsfrom M. butyricum , a common soil bacterium with no known pathologies associated with it was tested andproved to be as efcacious as FCA. 40Thus, this is the adjuvant of choice since 1998. Rare injection sitereactions still occur after inoculation, even withFMA or FIA, but seldom exceed 1%. 40One study41 demonstrated a higher incidence of injection sitereactions in horses treated remotely, with darts, thanthose treated by hand-injection. This suggests thatinjection site reactions may be as much a function ofdelivery as the actual vaccine. Delivery by dart mustresult in surface bacteria and debris being pushedinto the injection site. In the absence of either short-term or long-term health issues, PZP contraception is now common in free-ranging and sanctuary wild horses, urban deer, zoo animals, and African ele-phants. Other safety issues have been reviewed inmore detail elsewhere. 42 Other immunogens have been used in horses but thus far none have been applied to free-ranging wildKIRKPATRICK ET AL. American Journal of Reproductive Immunology 66(2011) 40-50 42 \u00aa2011 John Wiley & Sons A/Shorses except in small-scale research trials. Several approaches targeted the stallion. GnRH vaccineshave demonstrated that testicular function can besuppressed in the stallion. 43,44However, the application of these vaccines to wild horses is contra- indicated because of the suppression of testosterone- mediated reproductive behaviors, which arenecessary for holding breeding bands together in theface of competition from other stallions. The entiresocial structure of wild horses is disrupted if thedominant stallion is chemically castrated. Further,studies have shown that control of dominant males,by means of vasectomy, in wild horses is not effec- tive because this increases the reproductive success of bachelor stallions. 45A second problem associated with targeting the male of the species, is that, if it isnot a harem-based social structure, nearly everymale in the population will need to be treated, andthis is probably not logistically possible. Thirdly, theremoval of functioning males from the breeding pop-ulation may have far more serious genetic conse- quences that treating females 46,47and certainly provides less management flexibility. Three commercial GnRH vaccines have shown success in suppressing reproduction in mares. BothEquity /C210(Pzer Animal Health, Sandton, South Con/C210, a GnRH vaccine developed by USDA, primarily for use in deer, was tested in captive wild mares and also was successful in blocking cyclicactivity and ovulation. 50A fourth commercial GnRH vaccine, Repro-BLOC/C210(Amplicon Vaccine, Pullman, WA, USA) has been developed as an alternative tocastration in cattle. This latter vaccine utilizes a ser-ies of GnRH genes, which were cloned into an oval-bumin carrier via an Escherichia coli expression vector. Aside from trials in cattle, Repro-BLOC /C210has been used to suppress estrus in captive Asian ele-phants and proposed as a contraceptive for this spe-cies; 51however, ve serial inoculations were required to achieve adequate anti-GnRH titers.Despite contraceptive success, and clear potentialapplications to several other species, the applicationof GnRH vaccines to wild horses brings to the fore issues that usually are not considered with human contraception. The complex evolutionary social orga-nization of horses and other equids is driven to alarge degree by reproductive steroids. In the case ofGnRH vaccines, the result is, although temporary, anon-surgical castration. Public opinion, which directsso many aspects of contraception, human, or wild- life, requires in the case of wild horses an intact setof social behaviors. The same is true for elephantsand most captive exotic species in zoos. Other potential safety issues regarding GnRH vac- cines remain. Safety for use in pregnant animals remains a species-specic issue. In those species thatrely on pituitary Luteinizing hormone (LH) to main-tain the corpus luteum of pregnancy throughout theentire gestation period, GnRH will cause abortion.This is not an issue in a species such as the horse,where placental hormones take over the task of sup-porting pregnancy, but use in bovids, for example, such as the bison, or during the rst half of preg- nancy in the goat family would interfere with preg-nancies in progress. More troubling, however, are avariety of other issues associated with any vaccinethat blocks GnRH. It has now been demonstratedthat GnRH receptors exist in a variety of tissuesthroughout the mammalian body, including the cer-ebellum, 52bladder,53and cerebrospinal fluid.54Now recognized as a form of has physiological effects throughout the central nervoussystem. GnRH in the hippocampus has beenimplicated in Alzheimers-like syndrome. GnRHactivity can alter olfactory function, which is, ofcourse, vital in the reproductive process for so manywildlife species. In the cerebral cortex, GnRH cancause depressed activity, and in the cerebellum GnRH has a correlative link to two genetically based disorders, including Gordon-Holmes Syndrome andBoucher-Neuhauser Syndrome. In the pituitary, ithas also been demonstrated that GnRH affects morethan just gonadotropic cells. 55The action of GnRH in cardiac tissue, which is exceptionally rich inGnRH receptors, may also be an important safetyissue. At least two studies have demonstrated a seri- ous and negative effect on cardiac function and in men, blocking GnRH can place the patient at greaterrisk for coronary infarction. 56,57Whether or not these particular safety issues have any clinical rele-vance to free-roaming or captive wildlife remains tobe seen. However, it becomes intuitive that vaccinesthat exert their influence further 'upstream' in thereproductive process and which have interactions with non-reproductive tissues will be more problem- atic than those with target tissue specicity and thatexert their effects further 'downstream' in the repro-ductive process. In white-tailed deer, safety issues relating to PZP largely paralleled those of wild horses, but withCONTRACEPTIVE VACCINES FOR WILDLIFE American Journal of Reproductive Immunology 66(2011) 40-50 \u00aa2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S 43some exceptions. Reversibility of contraceptive action occurred after 1-3 years in captive PZP-trea-ted deer 11and after 1-4 years in another study with captive deer.12An earlier study demonstrated that there were no changes in ovarian histology, but that the breeding season was extended by one to 2 months in PZP-treated deer.17In one study, this resulted in a pulse of late births the rst year, but insubsequent years, the late births did not occur. 58 Treated deer were more active than untreated deerbut did not spend more time feeding. Despite theincreased activity, treated deer gained signicantlymore weight by the summer following treatment than untreated deer, presumably because of avoid- ance of lactation, but by the following fall, all weightdifferences disappeared. 59,60 Potential changes in ovarian histology were a con- cern. Prior to application of PZP vaccines to wildlife,some temporal changes in ovarian function wereshown to occur in PZP-treated non-human pri-mates 61and mice,62but long-term effects did not occur. Early studies with PZP-treated dogs revealed signicant changes in ovarian histology.63Another study64demonstrated similar effects in PZP-treated rabbits, along with a depletion of primordial follicles.Among PZP-treated sheep, signicant changes in theovarian histology were found. 65The dog study was probably compromised by a rather impure PZP, andthe rabbit and sheep studies revealed species differ- ences in response to the PZP. Collectively, this research raised an issue of concern as wildlife con-traception moved forward and into the realm ofmanagement. In the rst trial with PZP and horses, 9no changes in ovarian histology were found, and other investiga-tors had demonstrated ovarian weights and histologywere unchanged after PZP of white-tailed deer. 17In another study66ovarian eosinophilic ooph- oritis was found in six of eight treated deer, but thisrate was not signicantly different from controls. Thissame study revealed that this condition is common inuntreated deer at the time of ovulation. Despite theabsence of any signicant changes in ovarian histol-ogy in wildlife studied thus far, it is vital that eachspecies be evaluated for potential changes. Blood chemistry studies in treated white-tailed deer revealed only a few signicant changes after PZPtreatment, but none was associated with any physio-logical abnormalities. 66,67Ongoing studies with Dall sheep goats ( Capra hircus ) reveal the same lack of blood chemistry changes inthese two species.42Injection site abscesses were found in only 2 of 353 deer (0.5%)68and 100% of PZP-treated deer revealed granuloma formation atthe injection site 66but without any complications. Efcacy A major challenge in the development of human im- munocontraceptives is the variability in immuneresponses by individuals, similar to that which is evi-dent in so many prophylactic vaccines, such as influ-enza. It is unlikely that humans will usecontraceptives with efcacy as low as even 95%. There are individual differences within a species in reactions to contraceptive immunogens. For exam-ple, examining the anti-PZP antibody titers from in response to thesame immunogen, the same dose, and the sameadjuvant. However, for wildlife populations, a vari- ety of modeling 71and results from eld trials21have demonstrated that contraceptive vaccines with lessthan 100% effectiveness will sufce. Clearly there are species differences as well. For wild horses treated with native PZP, efcacy isapproximately 95% over 23 years. 21In the case of white-tailed deer, there is more variability,11,22with an efcacy of approximately 75%. Among PZP-trea- ted wapiti, efcacy ranged from a low of 84% to a high of 90%.23African elephants in one population have responded with a 100% efcacy over 10 yearsof management. 20Among captive exotic species, ef- cacies ranged from in Sambar several other ungulates.72Thus, a major challenge to the development of wildlife immunocontraceptives is theability to inhibit fertility across diverse species. Gon-aCon-B /C210and SpayVac/C210have both been associated with efcacies in the ranges of 39-64% and 27-48%, respectively, in wild horses 73while SpayVac/C210 was associated with 100% efcacy in fallow deer over 3 years.74The GnRH vaccine Improvac/C210, when given to domestic mares in two inoculations over35 days provided 100% efcacy with cycling andovulation as the endpoints. 48 This latter issue reflects both a strength and weak- ness of PZP immunoconception, and for that matterKIRKPATRICK ET AL. American Journal of Reproductive Immunology 66(2011) 40-50 44 \u00aa2011 or proteinhormone Unlike reproductive steroids,which have absolute homology across species, pro-tein hormones reveal amino acid differences across species. In the case of PZP, there must be an immune response to an epitope of either or both the PZP-1and the PZP-3 alpha glycoprotein for a successfulantibody response white-tailed and ZP-3 glycoproteins 75,76but in domestic cats, the same antibodies do not recognize any segment of the zona glycoproteins.77,78While a species-by-species analysis of cross-reactivity with PZP-induced antibodies occurred, it is clear that species-specic epitopesvary across taxonomic lines and will affect the con-traceptive efcacy of the immunogen. Thus far, PZP-induced contraception has not failed in any of 64members of Ungulata in which it has beenattempted, whether members of Perissodactyla or Artiodactyla, 42or bears72,79or pinnipeds.72,80This implies some evolutionary relationships among theepitopes of the zona sperm receptor. Although notdirectly related to contraceptive research, the applica-tion of zona proteins from, and directed toward, avariety of species across broad taxonomic lines willsurely reveal interesting evolutionary pathways inthe development of the sperm receptor. Duration of contraceptive action Vaccines generally, but not universally, employ killed or attenuated virulent organisms and theimmune response by humans and domestic animalsis very powerful, with lasting effects even after a sin-gle inoculation. In contrast, contraceptive vaccines generally target reproductive hormones or tissue receptors, and the ability to cause long-lasting eleva-tions in antibodies, individual differences notwith-standing, is far more challenging, because of therelative homology of these protein moleculesbetween species. It is intuitive that a single inocula-tion, long-lasting contraceptive vaccine is valuableand a worthy goal for free-ranging wildlife. The current major shortcoming of the most widely used wildlife contraceptive, PZP, is that contraceptiveduration is short-lived, at least during the rst fewyears of treatment. An initial inoculation followedby a booster inoculation 2-6 weeks later generallyprovides a year of contraception. But then, anannual booster is required for a second year of con- traception. At least for the rst 2-3 years, this is arequirement for successful contraception. Following3 years of treatment, the duration of high antibodytiters is sufcient for successful contraception over several years and eliminates the need for annual booster inoculations. For example, in the wild mare,3 years of treatment, from age 2 through 4, result incontraception that lasts for a mean of 3.7 years.However, the range is 1-8 years. 33 This shortcoming of native PZP has stimulated a search for more lasting contraceptive vaccines. Sev-eral approaches to this challenge have occurred. The rst approach has attempted to incorporate the PZP glycoprotein in biodegradable, non-toxic matrices,which can be injected and which then release thePZP molecule slowly in a sustained release or inpulsed releases. The matrix used thus far has incor-porated various ratios of lactide-glycolide, either inthe form of microcapsules 81or in the form of small pellets that can be injected either by hand or by dart.82-84Results thus far have been encouraging, but not denitive, and a great deal of variability inboth the manufacturing process and the results hasresulted. Another difculty with this approach isthat it has not been possible to incorporate powerfuloil-based adjuvants in the microcapsules and pellets. A second approach has incorporated a novel 'packaging' of the PZP. In the case of a proprietary product, SpayVac /C210, native PZP is incorporated into a multilamellar liposome. This platform appears to pro-vide a much longer duration of high antibody titersand contraception in seals, 80fallow deer,74white- tailed deer85,86and horses.71Contraceptive duration appears to last for at least 3 years following a singletreatment. The primary drawbacks to this approachappear to be the high viscosity of the preparation and the inability to deliver it remotely, and possible side effects on reproductive tissues, 50at least in horses. The former is a technical problem and maybe overcome, and the latter requires substantiallymore safety testing before this approach becomespractical. Nevertheless, an important point here isthat native PZP vaccine must not be confused withmore complex vaccines containing PZP. A third approach that has shown promise is the GnRH vaccine GonaCon /C210. This vaccine targets the GnRH molecule and blocks and estrus bypreventing endogenous GnRH from stimulating FSHand LH the pituitary. In turn, thelack of gonadotrophs inhibits ovarian and testicularCONTRACEPTIVE VACCINES FOR WILDLIFE American Journal of Reproductive Immunology 66(2011) \u00aa2011 John Wiley gamete production. As with PZP, there are structural differences in the GnRH of variousspecies, with varying degrees of homology. Thismeans that the vaccine will work in some speciesbut not as well or at all in others. GonaCon /C210was developed primarily for application to white-tailed deer,12,87-90but also works in wapiti,91swine,92and horses.50In the case of GonaCon/C210the longer lasting duration of antibodies has been accomplished by theaddition of aromatic amino acids to the structure,which enhances immunogenicity but without inter-fering with binding to pituitary receptors. Puzzling,however, trials with free-ranging deer resulted in signicantly lower efcacy than those with captive animals. Alternatives to longer acting vaccines have exam- ined delivery systems. As early as 1993, the idea wasput forward to engineer the genes for immunogenicproteins into bacterial or viral vectors. 93-95Known collectively as genetically modied organisms(GMO), the theory was that a gene for an immuno- genic molecule that causes fertility inhibition, such as PZP, or GnRH, might be engineered in a non-pathogenic virus, which could then be used to infectthe target species and express the gene. There aremultiple questions associated with this technology.Can the vector persist for a long enough time toexpress the immunogen? Could the vector expressthe immunogen in sufciently large quantities to eli- cit adequate antibodies? Will the vector reach a suf- ciently large portion of the population to alterdensity? 96Research followed that examined a num- ber of possibilities. Cloned genes for PH-20, LDH-C4,and ZP3, all of which encode for gamete proteinswere proposed for incorporation into GMO vec-tors, 97,98but none ever reached the eld test stage. Signicant issues of regulation were raised for a con- traceptive method that, once released into the envi- ronment, could never be called back.99The issue of mutation rates in viruses, and the potential for thevector to infect non-target species, was also an issue.For example, a vector that could successfully infectand cause contraception in non-native foxes in Aus-tralia would probably also bring about the sameresult with domestic dogs. One study concluded that the effort to assess risks of contraceptive GMOs would be greater than the effort to develop the tech-nology. 99These and many other concerns have led to a cessation of this line of research for wildlife im-munocontraceptives and have been summarizedelsewhere. 100-102One exception to this trend is a research effort in New Zealand.103,104Here, the vector is a nematode parasite Parastrongyloides trichosuri and The parasite is species-specic and mutation into some form that might infect other species isunlikely. If a gene for a contraceptive protein can beengineered into this parasite, and can be expressedeffectively, it may open the door to similar approaches in other species. Of course, there is no guarantee that this particular parasite could not ndits way to Australia and infect native possums. One nal approach to the problem of long-term immunocontraception of wildlife remains. Oraldelivery of a contraceptive vaccine would overcomethe need for laborious delivery systems currentlynecessary for sustained antibody titers in target ani- mals. 105Currently, this approach is not a practical reality, but the challenges have been clearly delin-eated. First, either the contraceptive vaccine itselfhas to be species-specic or the oral delivery systemmust be species-specic. Approaches under consider-ation include transgenic plants 102and bacterial ghosts,106both carrying genetic information for a contraceptive immunogen.

Conclusions Immunocontraception for wildlife management has become a reality since its rst application in 1988.Today, animals treated annually number in the thou-sands, and controlled alterations in population sizeare occurring in various settings at ever-increasingfrequency. The most widely used wildlife contracep-tive is native porcine zona protein, largely because of its ability to inhibit fertility in such a large breadth of species, its tissue-specic action, and because of itsimpressive safety record. Currently six different free-ranging wildlife species are being managed by meansof PZP immunocontraception on 52 sites and 76 cap-tive exotic species are being treated in 67 zoologicalgardens around the world. Several GnRH vaccinesshow promise, but widespread application will have to wait for more extensive safety testing. Table I sum- marizes and compares the major characteristics ofPZP and anti-GnRH vaccines. The extraordinary suc-cess with actual eld applications of wildlife immuno-contraception over the past two decades has created anew paradigm. Only 23 years ago, the primary ques-tion was whether or not we could economically deli-ver, safely treat, and effectively regulate wildlife populations with vaccine-based contraception. Today, the new question is how we can achieve this goaleasier, with less effort and cost and gain publicapproval at all levels. The remaining challenges nowcenter on improving delivery systems, modicationsof the vaccine components to enhance the durationof effectiveness, assuring comprehensive safety,developing a sustainable funding base for research, and achieving general acceptance.
