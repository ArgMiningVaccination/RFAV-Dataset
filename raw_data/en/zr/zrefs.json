This is the neurotransmitter that is responsible for regulating mood, sleep, appetite and digestion. YES! This means that poor gut function may be the culprit to your mood disturbances, poor sleep, and mental health disorders. Optimal digestion occurs when our nervous system is in a parasympathetic (relaxed) state. Stress can wreak havoc on the digestive system and either slow down or stop the digestive process. This can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, stomach ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome. Improving digestive function might be the missing link to proper mental health. This package includes: - Comprehensive Naturopathic Intake - 90 minutes - 5 Follow Up Visits - 50 minutes each - Advanced Stool testing to assess for gut dysbiosis, gut inflammation, enzyme function, presence of gut infections and maldigestion. - Complete 4-R Protocol to reset proper gut function - Diet and Lifestyle therapies which includes Elimination Diet and Tailored Dietary Plans - Nutraceutical and Botanical therapies to support proper gut function - 10% Discount through Fullscript (Online dispensary) - Mind-Body therapies to help restore normal Sympathetic (fight or flight) and Parasympathetic (rest and digest) function.
